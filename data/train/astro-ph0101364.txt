    "the dynamical mechanisms that dominate the formation and subsequent evolution of planetary systems may be broadly described as either endogenic or exogenic in origin .",
    "the formation of giant planets , and their apparent orbital migration @xcite are probably the most significant endogenic source for modifying a planetary system over time . in our solar system , the giant planets have displaced a significant fraction of small bodies from their formation sites to either the oort cloud or interstellar space . for circumstellar dust disks observed around nearby main sequence stars , unseen giant planets are believed to produce the ubiquitous central depletions in the dust distributions @xcite",
    ".    however , young systems , such as pre - main sequence stars in clusters and the proplyd objects in orion , experience significant exogenic forces @xcite .",
    "close stellar encounters with other cluster members @xcite and radiation pressure from nearby massive stars @xcite remove disk material and can disrupt the vertical settling of circumstellar dust and gas . during the evolution of our solar system , the galactic tide and encounters with molecular clouds and passing stars decoupled comets from the planetary region , preserving them in the oort cloud @xcite .    the dust disk around the a5v star @xmath0 pic displays evidence for both types of dynamical mechanism . a planet may be responsible for clearing dust within @xmath120 au radius of the star @xcite , perturbing families of comets towards the stellar photosphere @xcite , vertically disrupting the disk at 50 au radius @xcite , and creating a few - hour duration , 0.06 magnitude , achromatic drop in @xmath0 pic s lightcurve @xcite .",
    "a recent and close stellar flyby perturbation may be responsible for producing the radially and vertically asymmetric disk structure at large radii @xcite , as well as substructure in one disk midplane between 500 and 800 au projected radius @xcite . since the age of @xmath0 pic is between 8 myr @xcite and 20 myr @xcite , understanding the dynamics of objects surrounding @xmath0 pic could elucidate conditions and events that determined the early evolution of our solar system .    here",
    "we will examine possible exogenic perturbations on @xmath0 pic . a key piece of observational evidence needed to confirm the stellar flyby hypothesis is to identify a perturbing star .",
    "given improved trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions from _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , we are motivated to test the stellar flyby hypothesis empirically .",
    "section 2 presents our method for using @xmath2 and radial velocity data to trace the galactocentric motions of stars relative to @xmath0 pic .",
    "section 3 identifies stars that have passed within 5 pc of @xmath0 during the past 1 myr . in section 4",
    "we assess the significance of the stellar encounters for the evolution of a possible oort cloud around @xmath0 pic .",
    "section 5 demonstrates the plausibility of very close stellar encounters and presents a list of candidate perturbers for future radial velocity observations .",
    "we search for candidate @xmath0 pic perturbers using data from the entire _ hipparcos _ catalog and the @xcite catalog of stellar radial velocities .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalog gives the positions , proper motions and parallaxes of 118,218 stars from which we compute the galactocentric coordinates .",
    "@xcite provide the mean radial velocities for 36,145 stars , of which 21,497 stars are also contained in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "we combine the radial velocities with the @xmath2 proper motion data @xcite to trace the space trajectories of the 21,497 stars during the past 1 myr",
    ".    the observed disk substructure should be short - lived due to orbital phase mixing .",
    "the dynamical models of @xcite and @xcite indicate that the perturbation occurred as recently as 10@xmath3 yr ago . however , we choose to extend the search 1 myr into the past to allow for the uncertainties introduced by the assumptions inherent in the models .",
    "key factors limiting the completeness of the search are the sensitivity constraints imposed by the two catalogs . in general , we expect that a significant fraction of late type stars near @xmath0 pic ( @xmath4 = 19.3 pc ) is undetected . for spectral types later than g5 ,",
    "volume 1 of the @xmath2 catalog states a completeness limit : @xmath5sin@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the galactic latitude . for @xmath0 pic ,",
    "@xmath8 degrees , giving a completeness limit @xmath9 mag . at @xmath4 = 20 pc",
    "this translates to @xmath10 6.3 mag , which corresponds to the absolute magnitude of a k2v star @xcite . at @xmath4",
    "= 30 pc , @xmath11 mag , which is the absolute magnitude of a k0v star @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 catalog includes a significant fraction of the a - g spectral types in a 10 pc radius volume around @xmath0 pic , but will miss k and m dwarfs [ in @xcite the @xmath0 pic disk perturber has a mass consistent with an m dwarf ] .    estimating the completeness of the @xcite catalog is considerably more difficult",
    "because it is not an all - sky survey , and the radial velocity information derives from different sources . even though the majority of stars are @xmath12 mag , comparable to the sensitivity limit of the @xmath2 catalog , the @xmath2 catalog contains more than three times as many stars .",
    "the incompleteness of our sample therefore exceeds 50% , and in section 3 we estimate an incompleteness of @xmath180% .",
    "future missions such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 will have the sensitivity to significantly improve the perturber search if radial velocity catalogs are also expanded .    for @xmath0 pic s radial velocity",
    "we choose the recent measurement given by @xcite because the published error , @xmath16 , is smaller than that determined by @xcite .",
    "experimental trials using other published radial velocities for @xmath0 pic ( e.g. lagrange et al . 1995 ) show negligible differences from the results presented below .",
    "the relatively short timescale considered here permits a first order estimate of the stellar trajectories using a straight line motion approximation .",
    "a correction for the two body interaction is only significant for very close ( @xmath17 pc ) and low relative velocity ( @xmath18 km s@xmath19 ) encounters . for each of the 21,497 stars we calculate a trajectory backward in time and determine the closest approach distance , @xmath20 ( pc ) , to @xmath0 pic and the time of closest approach , @xmath21 ( kyr ) , where @xmath21 = 0 is the present .",
    "to test the validity of the linear approximation for deriving trajectories we use a fourth order runge - kutta scheme to solve the equation of motion in the galactic potential for six of the 18 stars that approach within 5 pc of @xmath0 pic .",
    "we adopt the axisymmetric milky way mass distribution model provided by @xcite .",
    "this model has proven to be well adapted to the calculations of orbits @xcite and has been already applied to the motions of globular clusters and nearby stars @xcite . in the galactocentric cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath22 )",
    "the small value of @xmath23 in the range of time considered here permits the decoupling of motions in the galactic plane and on the @xmath24 axis .",
    "we check our calculations by reproducing the published results on the nearest approaches of stars with the sun @xcite .",
    "the initial coordinates and velocities have been changed from the heliocentric to the galactocentric reference frame using the current iau values for the lsr ( @xmath25=220 km s@xmath19 , r@xmath26=8.5 kpc ) . as expected , the agreement between the ( @xmath27 ) values derived from the straight line approximation and the ones calculated from the integrated galactic orbits allows us to restrict our computations to the linear case for the selection of candidates .",
    "the main advantage of adopting the the linear approximation is that we can determine the influence of the errors for the input positions and velocities on the estimate of ( @xmath27 ) through a monte - carlo draw .",
    "we use the standard deviations provided in the _ hipparcos _ catalog and the @xcite catalog .",
    "we assume a gaussian distributions for the errors , centered on the average value and with dispersion equal to @xmath28 .",
    "we produce 10@xmath29 random draws that for each star lead to a probability distribution in the closest approach plane ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the stars that approached within 5 pc of @xmath0 pic during the past 1 myr . for this subset of stars",
    "we then use @xmath30 to search the literature for recent radial velocity measurements that may not have been included in the @xcite catalog .",
    "@xcite have measured the radial velocity for hip 19893 and give a smaller measurement error than that listed by @xcite .",
    "we therefore re - calculate the space trajectory and errors using the @xcite radial velocity , which is given in table 1 .",
    "we make the same correction for hip 17378 , which has a more accurate radial velocity measurement from @xcite . as with @xmath0 pic ,",
    "trials using different published radial velocity measurements for each star produce negligible changes in the final values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "from the 21,497 stars selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalog and @xcite catalog , 18 are found to have @xmath32 pc with respect to @xmath0 pic in -10@xmath33 yr @xmath34 0 .",
    "table 1 lists the values of their respective trajectory parameters .",
    "columns 2 and 3 in table 2 give the maxima and 1@xmath35 uncertainties for the probability density distributions derived from the monte - carlo draws for ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath27 values resulting from the monte carlo draw for a subset of stars with @xmath31 3 pc .",
    "figure 2 presents the results in the form of isocontours representing the 68.3% , 95.4% , and 99% confidence levels for finding a star within a given region in the close encounter plane ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "an encounter probability is determined by dividing the contour area below a specified closest approach limit , by the total contour area in the @xmath27 plane .",
    "the probabilities that each star approached @xmath371 pc and @xmath37 0.5 pc with confidence levels of 95.4% and 68.3% are listed in columns 5 and 6 in table 2 .",
    "three stars - hip 23693 , hip 27628 , and hip 29958 - have @xmath38 1 pc",
    ". however , the greater uncertainties in the observables for hip 29958 ( table 1 ) mean that there is only a 10% probability at the 95.4% confidence level that its closest approach was @xmath371 pc . for hip 23693 and hip 27628 , the probabilities that @xmath39 1 pc are @xmath4050% .",
    "hip 93506 and hip 116250 are notable because 2 - 3@xmath41 yrs before their closest approach with @xmath0 pic ( table 2 ) , they passed @xmath373 pc from the sun @xcite .",
    "the incompleteness of our sample is evident by comparing the number of candidate perturbers found by this experiment to the number expected .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0 pic s heliocentric distance , @xmath4 = 19.3 pc , places it within the solar neighborhood , then the stellar encounter frequency should be roughly equal to that of the sun : @xmath42 myr@xmath19 for @xmath431 pc @xcite .",
    "thus , our search produces a factor of @xmath15 too few perturbers . using the @xmath2 catalog , @xcite give their empirical finding that @xmath44 3.5 d@xmath45 myr@xmath19 , and they conclude that their sample is incomplete by at least 50% . for our @xmath46 pc cut - off , the empirical relation given by @xcite yields @xmath47 106 myr@xmath19 , but for @xmath0 pic we find @xmath48 myr@xmath19 ( table 1 ) .",
    "again , the discrepancy indicates that our sample is @xmath120% complete .",
    "thus we expect that a volume - limited search realized with future stellar catalogs will reveal at least @xmath110@xmath49 stars approaching @xmath0 pic within 5 pc .    to determine which candidate perturber had the greatest dynamical impact on @xmath0 pic , we factor in the relative stellar masses and velocities .",
    "we calculate the velocity impulse @xmath50 due to each stellar passage on both a @xmath0 pic disk particle ( @xmath51=10@xmath52 au ) and on a hypothetical oort cloud object ( @xmath51=10@xmath3 au ) . under the impulse approximation ,",
    "the change of velocity @xmath50 of a comet relative to @xmath0 pic due to the influence of a passing star can be approximated as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass of the passing star , @xmath55 is the relative velocity , and @xmath20 and @xmath51 are the distances from @xmath0 pic to the passing star and to a comet , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the time of closest approach @xcite .    from @xmath58",
    "we can also estimate the change in eccentricity , @xmath59 , using the following result from numerical simulations @xcite : @xmath60 , where the comet s orbital velocity @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "integrating eq . 1 over @xmath0 we compute the average perturbation of a given close encounter on a shell of comets at distance @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting @xmath58 and @xmath59 for both the maximum perturbation ( @xmath63 ) and the average one at @xmath64 au are compiled in table 3 , together with the 1 @xmath35 uncertainties deduced from our monte - carlo draws , and plotted in figures 3a , 3b , 4a , and 4b .",
    "for @xmath65 au , the values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 are smaller by a factor determined from eqn .",
    "1 . for example , with the hip 23693 encounter",
    ", @xmath66 is a factor of @xmath67 smaller , and @xmath68 is @xmath69 smaller .    among the initial best candidates , hip 27628 ( # 8 )",
    "produces the greatest @xmath66 on particles located between itself and @xmath0 pic ( @xmath70 0.7 m s@xmath19 ) at the time of closest approach ( table 3 ) . however , its effect on the whole cloud is diminished due to its small mass and large relative velocity with respect to @xmath0 pic .",
    "similarly , hip 29958 ( # 10 ) , with @xmath71 and @xmath72102.1 km s@xmath19 , does not induce on average any notably large perturbation over the orbiting comets , even at @xmath64 au .",
    "hip 23693 ( # 6 ) remains then as the most significant perturber as it combines the smallest @xmath73 in our sample , a rather small relative velocity to @xmath0 pic ( 22@xmath74 km s@xmath19 ) and a large mass ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the candidate stellar perturbers detected by our search can not account for the @xmath10.005 pc close encounter simulated by @xcite to explain the observed dust disk morphology",
    ". however , the values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 at @xmath64 au may be large enough to impact the dynamical evolution of objects located beyond the detected dust disk , in a @xmath0 pic analog to the solar oort cloud . for a circular orbit at @xmath64 au ,",
    "the escape velocity for a @xmath0 pic comet , 176 m s@xmath19 , is significantly greater than the orbital velocity , 124 m s@xmath19 .",
    "thus , only the cumulative effect of perturbers will dynamically modify a @xmath0 pic oort cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "the values for @xmath59 are large enough that objects already on eccentric orbits , @xmath76 , could be stripped from the system after a single stellar perturbation .",
    "moreover , objects with @xmath77 au will experience a stronger perturbation that could lead to ejection .",
    "below we determine how the @xmath20 values for the candidate perturbers compare to the radius of a @xmath0 pic oort cloud , and then discuss the possible evolutionary effects of the perturbations .",
    "the maximum size of a planetesimal cloud gravitationally bound to @xmath0 pic is defined by the roche surface of the star , @xmath78 , set by the galactic tidal field @xcite : @xmath79 @xcite give the variance - weighted average from seven different studies for the galactic mass density , @xmath80 = 0.11 @xmath81 . if @xmath82 = 1.75 @xmath83 @xcite , then @xmath84 au , or @xmath11.1 pc .",
    "thus , at least three of the candidate perturbers ( table 2 ) penetrate @xmath0 pic s roche radius .",
    "other perturbers , though outside the roche radius , pass close enough to temporarily exceed the gravitational influence of the galactic tidal field .",
    "the distance from @xmath0 pic where the gravitational forces of @xmath0 pic and the perturber on an oort cloud comet are equal is given by @xcite : @xmath85\\ ] ] the last column of table 3 gives @xmath86 for each of the candidate perturbers .",
    "in addition to the three perturbers that physically enter the roche radius , hip 25544 has @xmath87 .",
    "thus a total of four stars out of the 18 in tables 1 and 2 penetrate a possible oort cloud around @xmath0 pic .    in general , stars passing near an oort cloud",
    "will either destroy a fraction of the cloud by sending comets into interstellar space or closer to the central star , or help build the cloud by increasing the periastron distances and hence the dynamical lifetimes of comets in the presence of planets .",
    "stellar passages within an oort cloud may induce comet showers which may briefly increase dust replenishment near the star @xcite . to determine which outcome results from the stellar perturbations identified here",
    ", we must first consider if the existence of a @xmath0 pic oort cloud is plausible , and if so estimate its evolutionary state .",
    "the four basic conditions for creating an oort cloud around a star are ( e.g. fernandez 1997 ) : 1 ) the formation of planetesimals in a region influenced by planets , 2 ) the existence of a massive planet to dynamically pump the semi - major axes of planetesimals from their formation site to large distances , 3 ) exogenic perturbations that decouple the planetesimals from the planets by increasing the planetesimals periastra , and 4 ) sufficient time ( stellar age @xmath40 relevant timescales ) .    for the first condition , the existence of meter to kilometer sized planetesimals around @xmath0 pic",
    "is inferred from : a ) the short lifetime of dust particles relative to @xmath0 pic s stellar age that implies a source of replenishment , probably from the collisional erosion of larger , unseen parent bodies @xcite , and b ) variable , transient absorption features modeled as the rapid sublimation of comet - like bodies near the photosphere @xcite . for the second condition , indirect evidence for a massive planet at @xmath11 - 10",
    "au radius is summarized in section 1 .",
    "the third condition , exogenic perturbations , are expected from passing stars , molecular clouds , and the galactic tidal field .    for the fourth condition",
    ", we compare @xmath0 pic s age , @xmath88 , to the timescales required to produce an oort cloud , as quantified by @xcite .",
    "two of the most important timescales are the diffusion timescale , @xmath89 , and the freezing timescale , @xmath90 .",
    "the diffusion timescale is the time for comet apastra to diffuse out to the roche radius of a star at constant periastra ( i.e. the time for a comet s energy to reach the escape energy from repeated interactions with a planet during periastron ) .",
    "the freezing timescale is the time for the galactic tide to increase comet periastra beyond the planet region , thereby freezing any further increase in the apastra . for a mature oort cloud ( i.e. well - populated and dynamically long - lived ) around @xmath0 pic we require @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath92 , then comet apastra will grow too quickly and achieve escape energy with one final encounter with a planet .",
    "the timescales are therefore sensitive to planet mass , @xmath93 , and semi - major axis , @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 , then the system may be in the process of forming an oort cloud , but the comets are probably still coupled to the planetary region .    to satisfy @xmath96 , @xcite gives the following expression : @xmath97 for @xmath98 , the following relation must be satisfied : @xmath99 the age - independent constraint given by eqn .",
    "5 is significant because it generally implies that no dynamically stable oort cloud will form if @xmath100 , even for a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "for example the saturn - mass extrasolar planet candidates around hd 16141 and hd 46375 @xcite will not produce an extrasolar oort cloud .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the regions that satisfy @xmath91 for a range of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , given @xmath101 , @xmath80 = 0.11 @xmath81 and @xmath88 = @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 yr . for @xmath0 pic s",
    "estimated age @xmath110@xmath105 yr , there is no combination of @xmath93 and @xmath94 that is capable of producing an oort cloud by the present epoch that is stable from ejection .",
    "in fact , a stable oort cloud is possible only towards the end of @xmath0 pic s lifetime , @xmath110@xmath106 yr .",
    "if we assume a combination of @xmath93 and @xmath94 that will eventually result in a @xmath0 pic oort cloud ( e.g. @xmath93 = 10 m@xmath107 , @xmath108 au ) , then at the present epoch comet apastra are only a few percent of their final values at @xmath110@xmath3 au .",
    "the dust disk is detected in scattered light as far as @xmath109 au @xcite , or @xmath11@xmath110 of the roche radius .",
    "depending on how future observations refine our knowledge of a planetary system around @xmath0 pic , the observed dust disk may trace the early evolution of an extrasolar oort cloud .    in summary ,",
    "objects orbiting @xmath0 pic near @xmath111 au radius might still be coupled to @xmath0 pic s planetary region .",
    "the galactic tidal field is insufficient to decouple these objects from the planetary region before they attain escape energy .",
    "the stellar perturbations identified in our search neither eject a significant number of comets into interstellar space , nor do they cause comet showers near the star",
    ". the evolutionary role of these stellar perturbations is to build @xmath0 pic s oort cloud by decoupling comet periastra from the planetary region .",
    "the most significant constraint on the completeness of this search is the lack of radial velocity information for nearly 100,000 stars in the @xmath2 catalog .",
    "the completion of an all - sky radial velocity survey , such as one proposed for the @xmath15 mission , has the potential to dramatically increase our knowledge of galactic space motions .",
    "however , given only the position , distance and proper motion data from the @xmath2 catalog , it is possible to exclude the stars that would not approach @xmath0 pic for any physically meaningful value of radial velocity , and identify a sample of stars that could plausibly encounter @xmath0 pic .",
    "we adopt an iterative approach , first assuming -120 km s@xmath112 120 km s@xmath19 , @xmath113=10 km s@xmath19 , to calculate @xmath20 and @xmath21 during the past 2 myr .",
    "we select the stars with @xmath39 5 pc , and repeat the procedure using @xmath113= 1 km s@xmath19 , and finally @xmath113= 0.1 km s@xmath19 for the stars with @xmath39 1 pc .",
    "we fix the initial positions , distances , and proper motions to the mean values given by the @xmath2 catalog , rather than utilize the monte carlo method discussed in section 2 .",
    "the results are displayed in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "tables 4 gives the maximum number of perturbers that can be `` produced '' by adjusting the radial velocity in order to get the closest possible approach to @xmath0 pic .",
    "a maximum of 93 stars approach @xmath0 pic with @xmath39 1 pc and @xmath114 -1 myr . as expected , very close and very recent crossing events are rare , and the more the time and distance constraints are relaxed",
    ", the more events are produced .",
    "the values given in tables 4 are upper limits to the number of encounters experienced by @xmath0 pic , exceeding the expected rate of @xmath371 pc encounters per myr by a factor of 7.5 ( section 3 ) .",
    "table 5 gives the 22 perturber candidates with @xmath115 pc during the past 1 myr .",
    "the columns designate the : ( 1 ) name of the star , ( 2 ) distance of the closest possible approach , ( 3 ) corresponding time , ( 4 ) radial velocity that produces @xmath20 , ( 5 ) interval of radial velocities such that the distance of closest approach remains below 0.5 pc , and ( 6 ) relative velocity at the closest possible approach .",
    "six candidate perturbers ( marked with an asterisk ) have @xmath39 0.1 pc and are capable of perturbing the observed dust disk .",
    "table 5 both gives a specific list of objects that require follow - up observations to determine their true radial velocities , and demonstrates the plausibility of very close stellar encounters with @xmath0 pic .",
