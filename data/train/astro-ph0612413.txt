    "the regime of circulation in hot jupiter atmospheres may be unlike any of the familiar cases in the solar system .",
    "hot jupiters are gaseous giant planets found in close , circular orbits around their parent stars , with periods on the order of a few days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "general arguments suggest that these planets should be tidally locked @xcite : their permanent day - sides are then continuously subject to intense stellar irradiation , while night - sides are only subject to modest internal energy fluxes .",
    "given such an uneven energetic forcing , atmospheric winds would tend to redistribute heat around the planet .",

    "two groups have attempted to address the global atmospheric circulation problem in hot jupiter atmospheres , using different approaches . on dynamical grounds , it was argued in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also showman & guillot 2002 ) , and explicitly shown via turbulent shallow - layer simulations in @xcite , that tidally locked hot jupiters occupy a regime of circulation that is qualitatively different from that of solar system giant planets .",
    "the few bands and prominent circumpolar vortices emerging in these simulations can be understood in terms of the large rhines scale and rossby deformation radius in these atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the large resulting spatial scales of moving circulation structures could lead to detectable hot jupiter variability .",
    "soon , interesting observational constraints will be placed on these circulation regime arguments .",
    "three hot jupiters have been detected through infrared secondary eclipses with the spitzer space telescope : hd189733b @xcite , hd209458b @xcite , and tres-1 @xcite .",
    "the planetary day - side flux is deduced from the eclipse depth measured when the planet is hidden behind its star .",
    "repeated eclipse measurements could thus reveal detectable levels of variability of the planetary day - side flux in these three systems . in this letter",
    ", we quantify the level of thermal infrared variability expected in secondary eclipse depths , according to the shallow - layer models of @xcite .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , turbulent equivalent - barotropic models published to date greatly emphasize dynamical aspects of hot jupiter atmospheric circulation .",
    "we adopt the same notation and adiabatic models as in @xcite : the global wind strength , @xmath0 , and the net amplitude of radiative forcing , @xmath1 , are parameterized , not predicted .",
    "however , given these two ( and other relevant global planetary ) parameters , the turbulent atmospheric circulation is consistently found to develop a broad equatorial wind and two large circumpolar vortices revolving around the poles in several planetary days (= orbits ) .",
    "the dynamically modified layer thickness in these models is a proxy for the planet s photospheric temperature field .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the models , as well as a vast exploration of their parameter space .",
    "our limited goal here is to show that the thermal variability expected in at least some of these models is sufficiently large to be detectable via repeated spitzer secondary eclipse measurements .",
    "consequently , we focus on a limited set of four models , with global wind speed values from @xmath2 to @xmath3  and a moderate amplitude of radiative forcing , @xmath4 ( allowing the weak thermal contrast of features in slow wind models to remain apparent ) .    the models are explicitly calculated for hd209458b parameters , at moderate t63 ( @xmath5 grid ) resolution , over a hundred planetary days or more .",
    "resolution tests ( up to t170 ) show that t63 is sufficient to capture atmospheric temperature features well enough for our present purpose .",
    "daily outputs from the simulations are used to generate model temperature maps of the day - side thermal emission in our variability study ( see below ) .",
    "table  1 summarizes the range of photospheric temperatures derived from these four models , for the two brightest planets in our study",
    ".    figures  [ fig : models1 ] and  [ fig : models2 ] show snapshots of orthographically projected , day - side temperature maps in hd209458b models with @xmath6 and @xmath7  , respectively , for two successive eclipses ( i.e. after one hd209458b day ) .",
    "these projections illustrate how thermal variability in total eclipse depth is expected , from one eclipse to the next , if large , high contrast temperature features , associated with moving circulation structures , are present ( in particular , the cyclonic circumpolar vortices most obviously visible in fig .  [ fig : models2 ] ) .",
    "each temperature map in figs .",
    "[ fig : models1 ] and  [ fig : models2 ] is shown partially eclipsed , for the specific geometry of the hd209458 system . according to these circulation models ,",
    "cold polar vortices have relatively small ( apparent ) areas , so that the magnitude of their contribution to a variable eclipsed day - side flux is unclear without a detailed calculation .",
    "our method to calculate eclipse depths in models like the ones shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : models1 ] and  [ fig : models2 ] follows very closely that used in @xcite to study partial eclipse diagnostics .",
    "planet - daily outputs from the circulation simulations provide the temperature fields used to model successive eclipses .",
    "accounting for system specific inclination and geometry , these temperature fields are orthographically projected onto a 2d disk discretized with ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) resolution elements in ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) . to calculate spectra , we assume that the vertical temperature profile follows radiative equilibrium according to the cloudless models of @xcite , under the assumption that the local flow temperature from the circulation model equals the effective temperature in the radiative model .",
    "we then integrate the spectral emission contributed by each apparent surface element on the planetary disk , in the global range of effective temperatures from @xmath12 to @xmath13  k.  k in the @xmath14800  models , a simple linear extrapolation of the spectra is performed . ]",
    "monochromatic fluxes at earth are then integrated over spitzer spectral bands ( for irac , irs , and mips ) to predict the corresponding successive eclipse depths . in the future , it will be important to improve upon this simple treatment by fully incorporating radiative transfer in circulation models .    as in @xcite",
    ", we also perform an idealized , bolometric blackbody analysis , to avoid relying exclusively on model specific features of the cloudless spectral emission models used . in these simpler blackbody models ,",
    "the bolometric flux contributed by each planetary disk surface element is scaled as the fourth power of the local photospheric temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_curves]a shows relative variations in successive eclipse depths predicted by the four hd209458b circulation models , assuming simple bolometric blackbody emission .",
    "variations are semi - periodic , as expected from the quasi - periodic motion of the circumpolar vortices around the planet . as the magnitude of the global wind speed , @xmath0 ,",
    "is increased from @xmath8 to @xmath3  , leading to higher contrast motion - induced temperature structures , the amplitude of thermal infrared variability also increases , from a few % to @xmath15-@xmath16% .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_curves]b shows eclipse depth variations for the hd209458b model with @xmath17  as before , but this time using the detailed spectral emission models to calculate contributions in various spitzer bands .",
    "while the overall variability scale is similar , it is clear that , by using spitzer bands , one preferentially filters emission from a selective range of temperatures on the planetary disk , which contribute to varying levels of variability .",
    "the effect is substantial and we find that variability is the strongest in shortest wavelength spitzer bands , where thermal contrast from the cold circumpolar vortices is the highest .",
    "we calculated explicit circulation models only for hd209458b but we can use the general dynamical similarity of hot jupiter atmospheres @xcite to rescale simply our results for hd189733b and tres-1 .",
    "assuming identical dynamics but allowing for different average atmospheric temperatures , we linearly rescale our model temperature maps proportionally to the zero albedo , fully redistributed equilibrium temperature , @xmath18 , of the other two planets ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the eclipse depth variability properties for hd189733b and tres-1 do not deviate from those of hd209458b by more than @xmath19% .",
    "increasing planetary albedos also has little effects on the variability properties , as long as albedos remain @xmath20 .",
    "finally , as a matter of generality , we have checked that arbitrarily varying any system s orbital inclination in the range 80 - 90   has little effect on its variability properties .",
    "we now address the feasibility of detecting variability in eclipse depth , at the level predicted by the above models , with spitzer .",
    "let us define @xmath21 as the fractional error on the eclipse depth , that is the ratio of the full ( 1-@xmath22 ) error on the eclipsed flux to the eclipsed flux itself .",
    "values of @xmath21 for the existing secondary eclipse measurements ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are listed in bold in table  2 .",
    "these numbers already suggest that eclipse depth variability at the level of @xmath23-@xmath24% could be detected in these systems .",
    "our variability models indicate , however , that specific spitzer bands may be much more useful than others for eclipse depth variability detections .",
    "we perform simple estimates of @xmath21 errors for any combination of spitzer instrument and hot jupiter system as follows .",
    "we use the same set of system parameters as in table  1 of @xcite . assuming that errors on the non - eclipsed flux are comparatively very small , we write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the noise per data point in units of the eclipsed flux and @xmath27 is the number of single data points collected during a full eclipse period .",
    "@xmath27 is the ratio of the secondary eclipse duration to the instrumental cadence ( taken from existing measurements ) .",
    "the eclipse duration time is calculated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the planet s orbital velocity , @xmath30 its orbital period , @xmath31 its orbital semi - major axis , @xmath32 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the stellar and planetary radii , respectively ( see table  1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we obtain values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37  hrs for hd189733b , hd209458b and tres-1 , respectively .",
    "finally , we extrapolate instrument - specific @xmath21 errors known for one system to the other two systems of interest by assuming blackbody emission for both the star and the planet .",
    "this results in the following instrument - specific scaling between systems a and b : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance to the system and @xmath40 is the planck function evaluated at the central wavelength of the instrumental band under consideration .",
    "@xmath41 is the stellar effective temperature and @xmath42 is the fully redistributed planetary equilibrium temperature calculated in the small albedo limit , exactly as in @xcite .",
    "the resulting extrapolated values of @xmath21 for the three systems of interest are listed in table  2 .    repeated eclipse depth measurements with irac for hd189733b and hd209458b appear to be the most likely to succeed in detecting atmospheric variability , at the few percent level or more .",
    "such variability measurements would be difficult for tres-1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_curves ] shows that any pair of successive eclipses will generally not display the full range of variability amplitude : more than two eclipse measurements are needed to sample variability properties adequately .",
    "this requirement can be quantified by calculating distributions of fractional variations in eclipse depth over series of 2 , 3 , 4 or more successive eclipse measurements . comparing these distributions of eclipse depth variations to the ( 1-@xmath21 ) errors listed in table  2",
    ", we find that detecting the eclipse depth variability predicted by the @xmath14400 or 800  models at the 2 - 3 @xmath22 level requires 3 - 4 irac eclipses ( at 4.5 or , slightly better , at 8) . a generally larger number of eclipses is needed to detect the variability predicted by models with smaller global wind speeds .",
    "eclipse depth variations at the level predicted by the @xmath14100  model would be systematically masked by eclipse depth measurement uncertainties , according to our estimates . finally , we note that a sufficiently large number of successive eclipse measurements could reveal the quasi - periodicity apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_curves ] .",

    "clearly , our circulation models and variability predictions are highly idealized .",
    "we have focused on simple thermal diagnostics in models describing an atmosphere as a single horizontal layer of turbulent fluid .",

    "* ) , the presence of high - altitude haze or the possible existence of clouds could all seriously affect our conclusions . even strictly within the framework of our shallow - layer models , we know that the parameterized amplitude of net radiative forcing , @xmath1 , can affect the thermal contrast , and therefore the detectability , of moving atmospheric structures ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we have recalculated all our circulation and variability models with increased values of @xmath43 and @xmath44.-@xmath45% contribution to the flow kinetic energy results from conversion of available potential energy .",
