    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) magnitudes and colors are widely used as one of the most powerful distance indicators as well as useful tools for probing stellar populations . to our continued consternation ,",
    "however , only solar - scaled sbf models have been calculated in the past .",
    "here we report , for the first time , alpha - element enhanced sbf models and compare them with observations . for those purposes , we have employed the teramo isochrones ( pietrinferni et al .",

    "our results also illustrate the dramatic impact of convective core overshooting on the predicted broad - band colors for models with ages near 1 gyr ( see also http://astro.wsu.edu/hclee/ hclee@xmath1208@xmath1aas@xmath110@xmath107.pdf ) .",
    "figure 1 shows our preliminary results ( aes : alpha - enhanced standard , sss : solar - scaled standard , where ` standard ' means no convective core overshooting ) in the v @xmath2 i vs. sbf i - band magnitude .",
    "two observational fiducial lines ( thick straight lines ) are overlaid with our theoretical models .",
    "the blue line is sbf i - band mag = @xmath22.13 + 2.44 @xmath3 [ ( v @xmath2 i ) @xmath2 1.00 ] from mieske , hilker , & infante ( 2006 ) for dwarf blue galaxies , while the red line is sbf i - band mag = @xmath21.68 + 4.5 @xmath3 [ ( v @xmath2 i ) @xmath2 1.15 ] from mei et al .",
    "( 2005 , originally calibrated at blakeslee et al . 2002 ) for massive red galaxies . from the comparisons , it seems that our preliminary results indicate that alpha - enhanced models are needed to match massive red galaxies while solar - scaled models are fine for dwarf blue galaxies to reproduce their independently estimated ages and metallicities .",
