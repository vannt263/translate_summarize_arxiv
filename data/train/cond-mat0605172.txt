    "the interest in superconductor - ferromagnet ( s - f ) hybrid structures has considerably increased in the last decade due to their relevance for the development of nanometer scale electronic devices .",
    "the understanding of the superconducting proximity effect in s - f devices is of vital importance for such a goal .",
    "consequently , experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the influence that proximity induced spin - triplet pairing amplitudes in s - f hybrid structures have on superconducting properties of the entire structure . among those are for example changes of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 of the device , or the switching between 0-junctions and @xmath2-junctions as ground states in s - f - s josephson devices as a function of some control parameter .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 in diffusive hybrid s - f structures has been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in several recent publications .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath0 has a non - monotonic dependence on the thickness @xmath4 of the ferromagnetic layers that provide information about the strength of the ferromagnetic exchange field and about the transparencies of the s - f interfaces .",
    "approximate analytic formulas for @xmath3 have been derived for several limiting cases,@xcite e.g. for thin or thick film thicknesses or for low or high interface resistances .",
    "recently , fominov _ et al .",

    "such an approach is valuable when theory and experiments are compared in detail with the aim to extract parameters as e.g. the ferromagnetic exchange field or the boundary transparencies .",
    "the possibility@xcite of a @xmath2-state ( characterized by a stable phase difference of @xmath2 between the superconducting order parameters ) is now well established experimentally in s - f hybrid structures involving several superconducting layers .",
    "transitions between the 0 and @xmath2 states have been revealed in s - f - s junctions by the oscillations of the critical current when varying the temperature@xcite or the ferromagnetic thickness.@xcite the transitions from the @xmath5 to @xmath2 state may also be revealed@xcite by the presence of cusps in the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath4 .",
    "because the cusps may be confounded with the oscillations of @xmath6 themselves , such a feature in the dependence of @xmath0 has been identified experimentally only recently.@xcite    the presence of several ferromagnetic layers introduces a new degree of freedom , the relative orientation angle , @xmath1 , between the magnetizations .",

    "a dependence of the critical current oscillations on the magnetization orientation has been also established theoretically in s - f - f-s junctions@xcite and multilayered s - f junctions.@xcite in ref .   and a switch between the 0 and @xmath2 states has been found from calculations of the josephson critical current by changing the mutual orientation between the moments .",

    "motivated by the recent experimental studies , we have developed a fast and effective method that is particularly suited for the numerical calculation of @xmath3 in diffusive hybrid structures .",
    "an important part of this paper is to present details of this method and discuss the calculations leading to some of the results presented in ref .  .",

    ", we also treat symmetric pentalayers , including the possibility of a phase difference @xmath2 between the two superconductors .",
    "this structure was recently studied experimentally in ref .  .",
    "from our @xmath0 calculations , we predict a switching between @xmath5- and @xmath2-junctions by the orientation of the ferromagnetic exchange fields in pentalayers consisting of a central josephson junction , two superconductors separated by a ferromagnet , sandwiched between two outer ferromagnets with exchange fields rotated relative to the central ferromagnetic layer .",
    "this kind of structure could be realized e.g. by fixing the moments of the outer layers , while rotating the moment of the central layer with an external magnetic field .",
