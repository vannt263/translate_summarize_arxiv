    "the rigorous study of the lyapunov spectrum finds its roots in the pioneering work of h. weiss @xcite . for the purpose of simplicity",

    "the lyapunov spectrum @xmath6 encodes the decomposition of the phase space @xmath1 into level sets @xmath7 of the lyapunov exponent ( i.e. the set where @xmath8 ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath6 is the function that assigns to each @xmath9 ( in an appropriate interval ) the hausdorff dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "weiss proved that the lyapunov spectrum is real analytic . a rather surprising result in light of the fact that this decomposition is fairly complicated .",
    "for instance , each level set turns out to be dense in @xmath1 . relying on his previous joint results with pesin  @xcite ,",
    "weiss studied the lyapunov spectrum via the dimension spectrum of the measure of maximal entropy .",
    "it is worth to mention that not only the analyticity of @xmath6 is obtained with this approach but it also gives , for each @xmath9 , an equilibrium measure such that @xmath7 has full measure and the hausdorff dimension of the measure coincides with that of @xmath7 .    in between the wealth of novel and correct results about lyapunov spectra",
    "briefly summarized above , the aforementioned paper  @xcite unfortunately contains a claim which is not fully correct .",
    "namely , that compact conformal repellers have concave lyapunov spectra  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ( 1 ) ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that non - compact conformal repellers may have non - concave lyapunov spectra ( see @xcite for the gauss map and @xcite for the renyi map ) .",
    "puzzled by this phenomena , our aim here is to better understand the concavity properties of lyapunov spectra . on one hand",
    "we characterize interval maps with two linear full branches for which the lyapunov spectra is not concave .",
    "in particular , we not only show that compact conformal repellers ( see example [ ex ] ) may have non - concave spectra , but that this already occurs in the simplest possible context . on the other hand ,",
    "we establish some general conditions under which the lyapunov spectra is non - concave . roughly speaking , the asymptotic variance ( of the @xmath10 potential ) should be sufficiently large ( in a certain sense ) .",
    "the class of maps that we consider is defined as follows .",

    "let us stress that the set of points for which the lyapunov exponent does not exist has full hausdorff dimension  @xcite .",
    "we will mainly be concerned with the hausdorff dimension of the level sets of @xmath26 .",

    "we say that @xmath6 is the lyapunov spectrum of @xmath3 .",
    "in our first result we consider linear cookie - cutters with two branches and obtain conditions on the slopes that ensure that the lyapunov spectrum is concave .",
    "this result can also be used to construct examples of non - concave lyapunov spectrum .    [",

    "we will make use of the thermodynamic formalism .",
    "let @xmath3 be a cookie - cutter map , denote by @xmath36 the set of @xmath37invariant probability measures .",
    "the topological pressure of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath3 is defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the measure theoretic entropy of @xmath3 with respect to the measure @xmath40 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) for a precise definition of entropy ) .",
    "a measure @xmath41 is called an equilibrium measure for @xmath10 if it satisfies : @xmath42 if the function @xmath43 is not cohomologous to a constant then the function @xmath44 is strictly convex , strictly decreasing , real analytic and for every @xmath45 there exists a unique equilibrium measure @xmath46 corresponding to @xmath10 ( see ( * ? ? ? * chapters 3 and 4 ) ) . moreover , there are explicit expressions for the derivatives of the pressure",

    "* chapter @xmath47 ) ) , the first derivative of the pressure is given by @xmath48 the second derivative of the pressure is the asymptotic variance @xmath49 where @xmath50 there exists a close relation between the topological pressure and the hausdorff dimension of the repeller .",

    "in fact , given a map with lyapunov spectrum having an inflection point at @xmath66 , it is natural to pose the general problem of understanding the geometric and ergodic properties of the equilibrium measure with exponent @xmath66 .    from our results",
    "it follows that the lyapunov spectrum of a cookie - cutter map has an even ( possibly zero ) number of inflections points .",
    "although theorem  [ a ] establishes the existence of maps with spectra having at least two inflection points , it does not give an exact count .",
    "we conjecture that the spectrum of a cookie - cutter map with two branches has at most two inflection points .",
    "also one may ask : is there an upper bound on the number of inflection points of the spectrum of a cookie - cutter map ? of a compact conformal repeller ?",
    "of a non - compact conformal repeller ?    our results are based on the following formula that ties up the topological pressure with the lyapunov spectrum @xmath67 this formula follows form the work of weiss @xcite and can be found explicitly , for instance , in the work of kessebhmer and stratmann @xcite . actually , in this setting , the lyapunov spectrum can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the unique real number such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the unique equilibrium measure corresponding to the potential @xmath72 .",
    "that is , @xmath73 is the inverse of @xmath74 .",

    "we let @xmath3 be the cookie - cutter with two linear branches of slopes @xmath77 and lyapunov spectrum @xmath6 , as in the statement of theorem  [ a ] .",
    "the proof relies on explicit formulas for @xmath6 together with a characterization of the inflection points that persist under small changes of the slopes @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( i.e. transversal ) .",
    "we show that unstable zeros of @xmath80 may only occur at the lyapunov exponent of the measure of maximal entropy when the logarithmic ratio of the slopes is as in the statement of the theorem .",
    "we start by obtaining an explicit formula for @xmath6 , from equation  .",
    "[ 2branchformula ] @xmath81.\\ ] ]    the equilibrium measure @xmath71 , in equation  , can be explicitly determined .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is a bernoulli measure ( see ( * ? ? ?",
