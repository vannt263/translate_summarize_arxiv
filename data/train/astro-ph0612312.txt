    "theoretical black holes ( bhs ) have been considered for almost a century , although their first observational evidence was not found until quite recently , during the past 3 decades . since then bhs have become essential ingredients in the construction of modern astrophysics on all scales , from binaries to galaxies and agns .",
    "it is stellar - mass bhs that offer us the best opportunity to study these objects in detail .",
    "their implications are wide ranging , from late evolution of massive stars , supernovae models , production of high - energy radiation , relativistic outflows , chemical enrichment in the galaxy , etc .",
    "but still the most compelling evidence for the existence of stellar - mass bhs relies on dynamical arguments , which will be the focus of this review .",
    "section 2 summarizes the first observations of historical bh `` candidates '' , whereas sect .",
    "3 reviews the most recent discoveries . in sect .",
    "4 we deal with bh demography and their mass distribution . finally , we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the late 1960s x - ray detectors onboard satellites revolutionized astronomy with the discovery of an unexpected population of luminous x - ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "the energetics ( with @xmath1 ) together with their short timescale variability ( down to milliseconds ) lend support to an interacting binary model where x - rays are supplied by accretion onto a collapsed object ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is now well stablished that there are two main populations of x - ray binaries : the high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , containing o - b supergiant donor stars , and the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , with typically short orbital periods and k - m donors .",
    "the optical flux in lmxbs is triggered by reprocessing of the x - rays into the accretion disc whereas in hmxbs it is dominated by the hot supergiant star ( see reviews in charles & coe 2006 and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it was not surprising that one of the first optical counterparts to be identified was the 9th magnitude supergiant star hd 226868 , associated with the hmxb cyg x-1 .",
    "but , remarkably , it showed radial velocity variations which made it a prime candidate for a stellar - mass bh ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the supergiant star was shown to move with a velocity amplitude of @xmath264 km s@xmath3 ( later refined to 75 km s@xmath3 ) in a 5.6 day orbit due to the gravitational influence of an unseen companion ( see fig .",
    "the orbital period @xmath4 and the radial velocity amplitude @xmath5 , combine in the mass function equation @xmath6 which relates the mass of the compact object @xmath7 with that of the companion star @xmath8 and the inclination angle @xmath9 .",
    "the mass function @xmath10 is a lower limit to @xmath7 and , for the case of cyg x-1 is 0.25 m@xmath0 .",
    "the key factor here is @xmath8 which , for a hmxb , is a large number and has a wide range of uncertainty .",
    "if the optical star were a normal o9.7iab its mass would be @xmath2 33 m@xmath0 which , for an edge - on orbit ( @xmath11 ) , would imply a compact object of @xmath2 7 m@xmath0 .",
    "however , the optical star is likely to be undermassive for its spectral type as a result of mass transfer and binary evolution , as has been shown to be the case in several neutron star binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it could be undermassive by as much as a factor of 3 given the uncertainty in distance , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . a plausible lower limit of 10 m@xmath0 , combined with an upper limit to the inclination of 60@xmath14 , based on the absence of x - ray eclipses , leads to a compact object of @xmath154 m@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    the importance of this result rests on the fact that there is a maximum mass for neutron stars ( ns ) to be stable against gravitational collapse ( @xcite ) .",
    "this maximum depends on the equation of state ( eos ) , which is uncertain in the high density regime because of the poorly constrained many - body interactions .",
    "however , @xcite showed that an upper limit of @xmath23.2 m@xmath0 can be derived assuming that causality holds beyond densities where the eos starts to be uncertain which , at the time , was 1.7 times the density of nuclear matter @xmath16",
    "g @xmath17 . more recently , a new limit of 2.9 m@xmath0 was obtained using modern eos which are accurate up to @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be further boosted by up to @xmath225% if the ns rotates close to break - up ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the compact object in cyg x-1 , with @xmath19 4 m@xmath0 , is a very strong bh candidate .    in 1975",
    "the satellite ariel v detected a0620 - 00 , a new x - ray source which displayed an increase in x - ray flux from non - detection to a record of @xmath250 crab .",
    "it belongs to the class of x - ray transients ( xrts , also called x - ray novae ) , a subclass of lmxbs which undergo dramatic episodes of enhanced mass - transfer or  outbursts \" triggered by viscous - thermal instabilities in the disc ( e.g. @xcite ) . during outburst , the companion remains undetected because it is totally overwhelmed by the intense optical light from the x - ray heated disc .",
    "however , the x - rays switch off after a few months of activity , the reprocessed flux drops several magnitudes into quiescence and the companion star becomes the dominant source of optical light .",
    "this offers a very special opportunity to perform radial velocity studies of the cool companion and unveil the nature of the compact star .",
    "the first detection of the companion in a0620 - 00 revealed a mid - k star moving in a 7.8 hr period with velocity amplitude of 457 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the implied mass function was 3.2 @xmath20 0.2 m@xmath0 , the largest ever measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "an absolute 3@xmath21 lower limit to the mass of the compact star of 3.2 m@xmath0 was established by assuming a very conservative low - mass companion of 0.25 m@xmath0 and @xmath22 , based on the lack of x - ray eclipses .",
    "this exceeds the maximum mass allowed for a stable ns and hence it also became a very compelling case for a bh .",
    "in the 1980s there was a hot debate about the real existence of bhs .",
    "on one hand there were 3 strong candidates , the hmxbs cyg x-1 and lmc x-3 and the transient lmxb a0620 - 00 , all with lower limits to m@xmath23 very close to the maximum mass for ns stability . on the other",
    ", alternative scenarios were proposed to avoid the need for bhs such as multiple star systems ( @xcite ) or non - standard models invoking exotic eos for condensed matter .",
    "an example of the latter are q - stars , where neutrons and protons are confined by the strong force rather than gravity and can be stable for larger masses ( @xcite ) . in this context , it was proposed that the _ `` holy grail in the search for bhs is a system with a mass function that is plainly 5 m@xmath0 or greater '' _ ( @xcite ) .    [ fig : fig2 ]    in 1989 , the x - ray satellite ginga discovered a new xrt in outburst named gs 2023 + 338 ( = v404 cyg ) .",
    "its x - ray properties drew considerable attention because of the exhibition of a possible luminosity saturation at l@xmath24 erg s@xmath3 and dramatic variability ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic analysis during quiescence revealed a k0 star moving with a velocity amplitude of 211 km s@xmath3 in a 6.5 day orbit ( see fig .",
    "the mass function implied by these numbers is 6.3 @xmath20 0.3 m@xmath0 , and hence the compact object must be more massive than 6 m@xmath0 , independent of any assumption on @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this remarkable result established v404 cyg as the `` holy grail '' bh for almost a decade . since then , many other bhs have been unveiled through dynamical studies of xrts in quiescence , seven others with mass functions also in excess of 5 m@xmath0 .",
    "this has been possible thanks to the improvement in spectrograph performance on a new generation of 10-m class telescopes over the last decade .",
    ".confirmed black holes and mass determinations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath25 masses compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath26 new photometric period of 30.8@xmath200.2 days recently reported by @xcite .",
    "the implied mass function , assuming constant velocity amplitude , would be 8.7 m@xmath0 .",
    "+ @xmath27 updated after @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath28 period is uncertain , with another possibility at 0.319 days ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this would drop the mass function to 6.18 m@xmath0 .",
    "table 1 presents the current list of 20 confirmed bhs based on dynamical arguments , ordered by orbital period .",
    "the case of grs 1915 + 105 is noteworthy , not only because of its long orbital period and large mass function ; also because ir spectroscopy was needed to overcome the @xmath29 magnitudes of optical extinction and reveal the radial velocity curve of the companion star ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that , although some systems have mass functions @xmath30 3 m@xmath0 , solid constraints on the inclination and/or m@xmath31 can be set which result in m@xmath32 3 m@xmath0 .",
    "the great majority of bhs are transients and only 3 show persistent behaviour , the hmxbs cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 . from the list we also note that a new class of transient x - ray binaries with a - f companions is starting to emerge , the so - called intermediate mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) .",
    "it has been proposed that lmxbs may descend from imxbs through a phase of thermal mass - transfer ( @xcite ) , although it is still unclear whether imxbs and lmxbs represent an evolutionary sequence .",
    "in addition to the dynamical bhs , there are @xmath33 other bh candidates based on their x - ray temporal and spectral behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , they have never been seen in quiescence , or they simply become too faint for an optical detection of the companion star .",
    "however , a new strategy was devised to allow the extraction of dynamical information in these systems during their x - ray active states .",
    "it utilises narrow high - excitation emission lines powered by irradiation on the companion star , in particular the strong ciii and fluorescence niii lines from the bowen blend at @xmath344630 - 40 ( see fig .",
    "this technique was first applied to the ns lmxb sco x-1 and the doppler shift of the ciii / niii lines enabled the motion of the donor star to be traced for the first time ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was also attempted during the 2002 outburst of the bh candidate gx 339 - 4 , using high - resolution spectroscopy to resolve the sharp niii / ciii lines .",
    "the right panel in figure 3 shows the radial velocity curve of the niii lines folded on the 1.76 day orbital period .",
    "the orbital solution yields a velocity semi - amplitude of 317 km s@xmath3 which defines a strict lower limit to the velocity amplitude of the companion star because these lines arise from the irradiated hemisphere and not the center of mass of the donor .",
    "therefore , a solid lower bound to the mass function is 5.8 m@xmath0 which provides compelling evidence for a bh in gx 339 - 4 ( @xcite ) . and most important",
    ", this technique opens an avenue to extract dynamical information from new xrts in outburst and x - ray persistent lmxbs , which hopefully will help increase the number of bh discoveries .",
    "( 250,190)(50,30 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    [ fig : fig3 ]      aside from dynamical arguments , there are other observations that lend support to the absence of a solid surface and , hence , the bh nature of these accreting compact objects , namely :    * lack of pulses and type i x - ray bursts .",
    "this has been quantified by @xcite using observations of dynamical bhs over 9 years of rxte data .",
    "the probabiliy that the non - detection of bursts were consistent with a solid surface is found to be @xmath35 . *",
    "the classic colour - colour diagram of x - ray binaries at high accretion rates shows a clear separation in the evolution of ns and bh binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has been ascribed to the presence of a boundary layer in ns which gives rise to an additional thermal component in the spectrum and drags ns outside the bh region . *",
    "for a given orbital period , quiescent bh binaries are @xmath2 100 times dimmer than quiescent ns binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "this difference is interpreted as thermal radiation from the ns surface which , for bhs , is advected through the event horizon .",
    "despite the handful of confirmed bhs one can try to account for selection effects and estimate the size of the underlying galactic population . to start with ,",
    "dynamical studies of xrts indicate that about 75% contain bhs , i.e. m@xmath36 m@xmath0 .",
    "also , the extrapolation of the number of bh xrts detected since 1975 , with outburst duty cycles of @xmath37 years , suggests that there is a dormant population of @xmath38 bh binaries ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is likely to be an underestimate if one accounts for systems with longer recurrence times and a likely population of faint persistent bh lmxbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "even so , incidentally , these numbers are in reasonable agreement with recent population synthesis calculations of bh binaries ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "stellar evolution models predict a population of about @xmath39 stellar - mass bhs in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our observed sample of bh xrts is just the tip of the iceberg of a large hidden population of which nothing is known .",
    "is it still possible to extract some meaningful information from such a limited sample ?    ( 250,200)(50,30 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    the main property of the bh population is the mass distribution .",
    "however , in order to get accurate bh masses , in addition to the mass function one needs to determine the binary inclination and the mass of the companion star or a related quantity such as the mass ratio .",
    "this information can be extracted from two experiments : ( i ) resolving the rotational broadening @xmath40 of the companion s absorption lines , which is correlated with the binary mass ratio and ( ii ) fitting synthetic models to ellipsoidal lightcurves from which the inclination angle can be determined .",
    "this is the classic method to derive masses which has been reviewed in several papers e.g. @xcite .    following this prescription",
    ", reliable bh masses have been determined in 15 binaries .",
    "these are listed in the last column of table 1 and displayed in figure 4 , relative to ns masses compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the figure nicely shows a mass segregation between the 2 populations of collapsed objects , with ns clustering around 1.4 m@xmath0 and bh masses scattering between 4 and 14 m@xmath0 .",
    "many more bh masses and errorbars @xmath4110% are needed before fundamental questions can be addressed such as ( i ) do bhs masses cluster at a particular value ?",
    "( ii ) what are the edges of the distribution , i.e the minimum and maximum masses for bhs to be formed in x - ray binaries ? ( iii ) is there a continuum distribution of masses between ns and bhs ?",
    "all these questions are intimately related to models of sn and close binary evolution .",
    "figure 4 also shows the histogram of the current distribution of compact remnant masses , relative to a model distribution computed by @xcite which includes mass - loss through winds and binarity effects .",
    "the model shows a mass cut at 12 m@xmath0 but this seems to be challenged by the compact objects in v404 cyg and grs 1915 + 105 , with 12 @xmath20 2 m@xmath0 and 14 @xmath20 4 m@xmath0 respectively",
    ". however , the conflict may be spurious since recent estimates of mass - loss rates in wolf - rayet stars suggests that previous determinations were biased too low ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the model predicts a continuum distribution between ns and bh whereas observations seem to show a paucity of objects at @xmath23 - 4 m@xmath0 .",
    "this may be caused by selection effects since low - mass bhs are expected to be persistent .",
    "recently , compact object masses in the range 2 - 4 m@xmath0 have been reported in 4u1700 - 37 ( @xcite ) , v395 car ( @xcite ) and ls 5039 ( @xcite ) .",
    "although they are assumed to contain ns , none of them has shown x - ray bursts nor pulses .",
    "therefore , they may well be members of the missing low - mass bh population .",
    "we are clearly dominated by low number statistics and more observations are required .",
    "the best observational evidence for the existence of stellar - mass bhs is provided by dynamical studies of x - ray binaries the first solid _ candidates _ were the classic x - ray binaries cyg x-1 and , in particular , a0620 - 00 .",
    "bhs became _ confirmed _ with the discovery of mass functions in excess of 5 - 6 m@xmath0 , the first case being v404 cyg .",
    "their global x - ray properties ( such as the lack of pulsations / bursts , weak quiescent lx , etc . ) also support the presence of an event horizon in these objects .",
    "xrts are the best hunting ground for new stellar - mass bhs with 17 cases currently known and estimated masses between 4 - 14 m@xmath0 .",
    "these are are only the tip of the iceberg of an estimated dormant population of @xmath38 bh binaries and @xmath42 stellar - mass bhs in the galaxy .",
    "clearly many more discoveries and better statistics are essential to derive useful constraints on bh formation models .",
