    "we are interested in designing strong series solutions of nonlinear stratonovich stochastic differential systems of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a @xmath2-dimensional wiener process and @xmath3 for some @xmath4 and all @xmath5 . we suppose that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , are smooth non - commuting vector fields which in coordinates are @xmath8 . repeated iteration of the chain rule reveals the stochastic taylor expansion for the solution to the stochastic differential system . indeed for any smooth function @xmath9 we have the formal stochastic taylor series expansion @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the collection of non - empty words over the alphabet @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt the standard notation for stratonovich integrals , if @xmath13 then @xmath14 we have also written the composition of the vector fields as @xmath15 .",
    "we define the flow - map @xmath16 as the map such that @xmath17 it has a formal stochastic taylor expansion of the form @xmath18 note that @xmath19 for all non - negative @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the identity mapping .",
    "classical strong numerical methods are based on truncating the stochastic taylor expansion for the flow - map and applying the resulting approximate flow - map @xmath22 over successive small subintervals of the global interval of integration required ( see kloeden and platen 1999 or milstein 1994 ) .",
    "an important and expensive ingredient in all numerical methods is the strong simulation / approximation of the required retained multiple integrals @xmath23 , on each integration step .",
    "here we will take their suitable approximation as granted ( see , for example , wiktorsson 2001 for their practical simulation ) .",
    "now let @xmath24 be a smooth function .",
    "we can also construct flow approximations from @xmath16 via the following procedure .",
    "@xmath25 construct the new series @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath25 truncate this series to produce the finite expansion @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath25 reconstruct an approximate flow - map as @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath25 the `` flow error '' is the flow remainder @xmath29 .    @xmath25 an approximate solution is given by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath25 the mean - square error in this approximation is @xmath31 .    for the special case @xmath32 , i.e.  the logarithm function ,",
    "this procedure was outlined by castell and gaines ( 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting series @xmath33 is the exponential lie series , which lies in @xmath34 , the non - commutative algebra of formal series generated by the vector fields @xmath35 .",
    "indeed any truncation @xmath27 , with multiple integrals replaced by suitable approximations , also lies in @xmath34 and is therefore a vector field .",
    "hence @xmath36 and an approximation @xmath37 to the solution can be constructed by solving the ordinary differential system for @xmath38 : @xmath39 for @xmath40 $ ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the solution to this system at time @xmath42 , itself approximated by an ordinary differential numerical method , is @xmath43 .",
    "so far , what has been proved for the castell  gaines method ?",
    "castell and gaines ( 1995 , 1996 ) prove that the strong order one - half method constructed in this way is always more accurate than the euler  maruyama method .",
    "indeed they prove that this method is _ asymptotically efficient _ in the sense of newton ( 1991 ) .",
    "further in the case of a single driving wiener process ( @xmath44 ) , they prove the same is true for the strong order one castell  gaines method . by asymptotically efficient we mean ,",
    "quoting from newton ( 1991 ) , that they `` minimize the leading coefficient in the expansion of mean - square errors as power series in the sample step size '' .",
    "lord , malham and wiese ( 2008 ) and malham and wiese ( 2008 ) proved that when the diffusion vector fields _ commute _ , but not necessarily with the drift vector field , then the strong order one and also three - halves castell  gaines methods have a mean - square error that is smaller than the mean - square error for the corresponding stochastic taylor method .",
    "however lord , malham and wiese ( 2008 ) also prove that for linear diffusion vector fields which do not commute , the strong order one castell ",
    "gaines method does not necessarily have a smaller mean - square error than the corresponding stochastic taylor method .",
    "indeed there are regions in the phase space where the local error of the stochastic taylor method is smaller .",
    "hence we are left with the following natural question when the diffusion vector fields do not commute .",
    "is there a solution series ansatz @xmath26 for some function @xmath45 , for which the mean - square error of the numerical method so constructed , is always smaller than the corresponding stochastic taylor method ? in this paper",
    "we answer this question , indeed under the assumption there is _ no drift _ , we :    \\(1 ) prove the mean - square error of an approximate solution constructed from the _ sinh - log _ expansion ( with @xmath46 above ) is smaller than that for the stochastic taylor expansion , _ to all orders_.    \\(2 ) prove that a numerical method based on the sinh - log expansion has a global error that is smaller than that for the corresponding stochastic taylor method .",

    "we examine and interpret these statements in detail next , in section  [ sec : ppleideas ] , where we answer the following immediate questions .",
    "first , what precisely , is the sinh - log approximation and the properties we prove for it ?",
    "second , how do we prove the result ; what is the connection with hopf shuffle algebras and the concatenation - shuffle operator algebra mentioned ? in section  [ sec : cspolys ] we provide the technical specification of the concatenation - shuffle operator algebra and prove some polynomial identities important for our main result . in section  [ sec : mainresult ]",
    "we present our main result .",
    "then in section  [ sec : prac ] we discuss the global error result above , and perform numerical simulations confirming our results .",
    "we give some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the goal of this section is to motivate and make precise statements about the sinh - log approximation we propose .",
    "we begin by outlining the approximation procedure presented in the introduction in more detail .",
    "suppose the smooth function @xmath45 has a real series expansion of the form @xmath47 with some finite radius of convergence about @xmath48 , and for some coefficient set @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "given the flow - map @xmath16 , we construct the series @xmath51 we substitute , into this series expansion , the stochastic taylor series for the flow - map @xmath16 .",
    "after rearrangement , we get @xmath52 where @xmath53 we truncate the series , dropping all terms @xmath54 with words @xmath55 of length @xmath56 .",
    "this generates the approximation @xmath27 , once we have replaced all retained multiple integrals @xmath57 by suitable approximations .",
    "then , in principle , we construct the solution approximation @xmath37 from @xmath30 , where @xmath58 performing this reconstruction is nontrivial in general ( see section  [ sec : prac ] ) .    for example , to construct the exponential lie series approximation of castell and gaines ( 1995 ) , we take @xmath32 and construct the series @xmath59 where @xmath60 for @xmath61 . substituting the stochastic taylor series for @xmath16 ,",
    "the series expansion for @xmath62 above becomes the exponential lie series ( see strichartz 1987 , ben arous 1989 , castell 1993 or baudoin 2004 for the full series ) @xmath63}(t)\\,v_{[w]}\\ ] ] where for @xmath13 we have @xmath64}=[v_{a_1},[v_{a_2},\\ldots,[v_{a_{n-1}},v_{a_n}]\\ldots]$ ] and @xmath65}=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\mathbb g_{|w|}}\\frac{(-1)^{e(\\sigma)}}{|w|^2d_{e(\\sigma)}^{|w|-1 } } j_{\\sigma^{-1}\\circ w}.\\ ] ] here @xmath66 is the group of permutations of the index set @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the cardinality of the set @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the combinatorial number : @xmath71 choose @xmath68 . truncating this series and using suitable approximations for the retained @xmath72 , produces @xmath27 .",
    "we then reconstruct the solution approximately using @xmath36 .",
    "the actual solution approximation @xmath30 is then computed by solving the ordinary differential equation generated by the vector field @xmath27 .    to construct the sinh - log approximation",
    ", we take @xmath46 so that @xmath73 where @xmath50 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 . again substituting the stochastic taylor series for @xmath16 we get the series expansion for @xmath62 shown above with terms @xmath76 where the coefficients @xmath77 now explicitly involve the sinh - log coefficients @xmath78 .",
    "then , in principle , we can reconstruct the solution approximately using @xmath79    suppose the vector fields @xmath80 , @xmath7 are sufficiently smooth and @xmath81 sufficiently small ( but finite )",
    ". then the approximation @xmath82 constructed using the sinh - log expansion , as just described , is square - integrable .",
    "further if @xmath83 is the exact solution of the stochastic differential equation , and @xmath22 includes all terms @xmath84 involving words of length @xmath85 , then there exists a constant @xmath86 such that @xmath87 ; here @xmath88 is the euclidean norm .",
    "this follows by arguments exactly analogous to those for the exponential lie series given in malham & wiese ( 2008 ; theorem  7.1 and appendix  a ) .    naturally , the exponential lie series @xmath62 and and its truncation @xmath27 lie in the lie algebra of vector fields generated by @xmath35 .",
    "hence @xmath89 is simply the ordinary flow - map associated with the autonomous vector field @xmath27 .",
    "the exponential lie series originates with magnus ( 1954 ) and chen ( 1957 ) ; see iserles ( 2002 ) .",
    "in stochastic approximation it appears in kunita ( 1980 ) , fleiss ( 1981 ) , azencott ( 1982 ) , strichartz ( 1987 ) , ben arous ( 1989 ) , castell ( 1993 ) , castell & gaines ( 1995,1996 ) , lyons ( 1998 ) , burrage & burrage ( 1999 ) , baudoin ( 2004 ) , lord , malham & wiese ( 2009 ) and malham & wiese ( 2008 ) .      examining the coefficients @xmath90 in the series expansion for @xmath91 above , we see that they involve linear combinations of products of multiple stratonovich integrals ( we suspend explicit @xmath81 dependence momentarily ) .",
    "the question is , can we determine @xmath90 explicitly ?",
    "our goal here is to reduce this problem to a pure combinatorial one .",
    "this involves the hopf algebra of words ( see reutenauer 1993 ) .",
    "let @xmath92 be a commutative ring with unit . in our applications",
    "we take @xmath93 or @xmath94 , the ring generated by multiple stratonovich integrals and the constant random variable @xmath95 , with pointwise multiplication and addition .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the set of all noncommutative polynomials and formal series on the alphabet @xmath97 over @xmath92 . with the concatenation product , @xmath96 is the associative _",
    "concatenation algebra_. for any two words @xmath98 with lengths @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we define the _ shuffle product _",
    "@xmath101 to be the sum of the words of length @xmath102 created by shuffling all the letters in @xmath103 and @xmath104 whilst preserving their original order .",
    "the shuffle product is extended to @xmath96 by bilinearity .",
    "it is associative , and distributive with respect to addition , and we obtain on @xmath96 a commutative algebra called the _",
    "shuffle algebra _ ( note @xmath105 for any word @xmath55 where @xmath106 is the empty word ) .",
    "the linear signed reversal mapping @xmath107 : @xmath108 for any word @xmath13 is the _ antipode _ on @xmath96 .",
    "there are two _ hopf algebra _ structures on @xmath96 , namely @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are unit and co - unit elements , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 respective co - products ( reutenauer , p.  27 ) .",
    "we define the associative algebra using the complete tensor product @xmath115 with the shuffle product on the left and the concatenation product on the right ( reuntenauer , p.  29 ) .",
    "the product of elements @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 and formally extended to infinite linear combinations in @xmath118 via linearity . as a tensor product of two hopf algebra structures ,",
    "@xmath118 itself acquires a hopf algebra structure .",
    "our goal is to pullback the flow - map @xmath119 and also @xmath91 to @xmath118 ( with @xmath93 ) .",
    "let @xmath120 be the set of all vector fields on @xmath121 ; it is an @xmath122-module over @xmath123 ( see varadarajan 1984 , p.  6 ) .",
    "we know that for the stochastic taylor series the flow - map @xmath124 ( with vector field composition as product ) .",
    "since @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the subset of @xmath120 of compositions of vector fields of length @xmath127 , we can write @xmath128 the linear _ word - to - vector field map _ @xmath129 given by @xmath130 is a concatenation homomorphism , i.e.  @xmath131 for any @xmath132 . and the linear _ word - to - integral map _",
    "@xmath133 given by @xmath134 is a shuffle homomorphism , i.e.  @xmath135 for any @xmath132 ( see for example , lyons , _ et . al .",
    "_ 2007 , p.  35 or",
    "reutenauer 1993 , p.  56 ) .",
    "hence the map @xmath136 is a hopf algebra homomorphism .",
    "the pullback of the flow - map @xmath119 by @xmath137 is @xmath138 all the relevant information about the stochastic flow is encoded in this formal series ; it is essentially lyons _ signature _ ( see lyons , caruana and lvy 2007 ; baudoin 2004 ) . hence by direct computation , formally we have @xmath139 where @xmath140 is defined by @xmath141 corresponds to @xmath90 ( indeed it is the pullback @xmath142 to @xmath143 ; see section  [ sec : cspolys ] ) .",
    "having reduced the problem of determining @xmath140 to the algebra of shuffles , a further simplifying reduction is now possible .",
    "the use of hopf shuffle algebras in stochastic expansions can be traced through , for example , strichartz ( 1987 ) , reutenauer ( 1993 ) , gaines ( 1994 ) , li & liu ( 2000 ) , kawski ( 2001 ) , baudoin ( 2004 ) , murua ( 2005 ) , ebrahimi  fard & guo ( 2006 ) , manchon & paycha ( 2006 ) and lyons , caruana & lvy ( 2007 ) , to name a few .",
    "the paper by munthe ",
    "kaas & wright ( 2008 ) on the hopf algebraic of lie group integrators actually instigated the hopf algebra direction adopted here .",
    "a useful outline on the use of hopf algebras in numerical analysis can be found therein , as well as the connection to the work by connes & miscovici ( 1998 ) and connes & kreimer ( 1998 ) in renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "for any given word @xmath144 we now focus on the coefficients @xmath140 . we observe that it is the concatenation and shuffle operations encoded in the structural form of the sum for @xmath140 that carry all the relevant information . indeed",
    "each term @xmath145 is a partition of @xmath55 into subwords that are shuffled together .",
    "each subword @xmath146 is a concatenation of @xmath147 letters , and so we can reconstruct each term of the form @xmath145 from the following sequence applied to the word @xmath55 : @xmath148 where the power of the letter @xmath149 indicates the number of letters concatenated together in each subword @xmath146 and the letter @xmath150 denotes the shuffle product between the subwords .",
    "in other words , if we factor out the word @xmath55 , we can replace @xmath140 by a polynomial @xmath151 of the letters @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "in fact , in lemma  [ lem : convert ] we show that @xmath152 thus we are left with the task of simplifying this polynomial in two variables ( lying in the real associative algebra of concatenation and shuffle operations ) .",
    "we devote section  [ sec : cspolys ] to the rigorous justification of this retraction , the result above , and those just following . a key ingredient is to identify the correct action of this algebra over @xmath153 .",
    "there is a natural right action by the symmetric group @xmath154 on @xmath155 , the subspace of @xmath96 spanned by words of length @xmath127 ( reutenauer 1993 , chapter  8) .",
    "this action is transitive and extends by linearity to a right action of the group algebra @xmath156 on @xmath155 .",
    "we are primarily concerned with shuffles and multi - shuffles , a subclass of operations in @xmath156 , and in particular , we want a convenient structure that enables us to combine single shuffles to produce multi - shuffles .",
    "the coefficient set @xmath49 determines the form of the function @xmath45 .",
    "our ultimate goal is to show order by order that the stochastic sinh - log expansion guarantees superior accuracy .",
    "hence order by order we allow a more general coefficient set @xmath49 , and show that the sinh - log choice provides the guarantee we seek .",
    "define the partial sinh - log coefficient sequence : @xmath157 where @xmath158 .    with the choice of coefficients @xmath159",
    ", we see that @xmath160 this has an even simpler form .",
    "[ lem : sinhlogcoeffs ] with the partial sinh - log coefficient sequence @xmath159 , the coefficient @xmath151 is given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the antipode for words of length @xmath163 .",
    "we think of @xmath164 , with expansion by concatenation , as the generator for the polynomial ( in @xmath165 ; see section  [ sec : cspolys ] ) defined by @xmath166 then by lemma  [ lem : antipodepoly ] in section  [ sec : cspolys ] we have the following identity @xmath167 hence using the sinh - log coefficients and splitting the first term , we have @xmath168    [ cor : coeffform ] for any word @xmath144 we have @xmath169 and thus @xmath170    for the stochastic sinh - log expansion the coefficients @xmath90 thus have an extremely simple form .",
    "there are several strategies to prove this form .",
    "the result can be proved directly in terms of multiple stratonovich integrals by judicious use of their properties , the partial integration formula and induction  the proof is long but straightforward .",
    "that this strategy works is also revealed by the strategy we have adopted in this paper , which we believe is shorter and more insightful .",
    "with @xmath171 , let @xmath172 denote the set of all noncommutative polynomials and formal series on @xmath173 over @xmath92 .",
    "we can endow @xmath172 with the concatenation product or shuffle product , and also generate an associative _ concatenation - shuffle operator algebra _ on @xmath172 as follows .",
    "the map @xmath174 , the associative and bilinear shuffle gluing product , is defined by @xmath175 i.e.  we concatenate the element @xmath176 with @xmath150 and the element @xmath177 in @xmath172 as shown .    endowed with the shuffle gluing product , @xmath172 is an associative algebra with unit element @xmath178 ( see reutenauer 1993 , p.  26",
    ", for the definition of @xmath178 ) .",
    "we define the graded associative tensor algebra @xmath179 by @xmath180 with the shuffle gluing product on the left in @xmath165 and concatenation product on the right in @xmath181here @xmath165 and @xmath181 denote the subspaces of @xmath172 and @xmath96 , respectively , spanned by words of length @xmath127 and @xmath163 , respectively .",

    "we plot the differences between the errors in the lower panel to confirm the better performance of the sinh - log integrator over the global interval .",

    "we have shown that the mean - square remainder associated with the sinh - log series is always smaller than the corresponding stochastic taylor mean - square remainder , when there is no drift , to all orders . since the order one - half sinh - log numerical method is the same as the order one - half castell  gaines method , it trivially inherits the asymptotically efficient property as well ( indeed , if we include a drift term as well ) .",
    "we have not endeavoured to prove asymptotic efficiency more generally .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : prac ] we demonstrated that for two driving wiener processes , the order one sinh - log numerical method is optimal in the following sense . from figure  [ eigenvalues ]",
    ", we see that any deviation of @xmath417 from zero will generate a negative eigenvalue for @xmath381 . consequently there",
    "exist vector fields such that the mean - square excess will be negative in regions of the phase space .",
    "further , from corollary  [ cor : oddeven ] , the order three - halves sinh - log integrator is also optimal in this sense .",
    "these results are only true when there is no drift , and it could be argued that our simulations and demonstrations are somewhat academic .",
    "however the results we proved have application in splitting methods for stochastic differential equations .",
    "for example , in stochastic volatility simulation in finance , ninomiya & victoir ( 2006 ) and halley , malham & wiese ( 2008 ) simulate the heston model for financial derivative pricing , and use splitting to preserve positivity for the volatility numerically .",
    "they employ a strang splitting that separates the diffusion flow from the drift flow and requires a distinct simulation of the purely diffusion governed flow .",
    "why is the sinh - log expansion the answer ?",
    "this result is intimately tied to the mean - square error measure we chose .",
    "the terms in the remainder of any truncation contain multiple stratonovich integrals .",
    "associated with each one is a mean - square error .",
    "there is a structure underlying these expectations .",
    "the sinh - log expansion somehow encodes this structure in an optimal form , it emulates the stochastic taylor information more concisely .",
    "the next question is of course , what is the best structure when we include drift ?",
    "answering this is our next plan of action .",
