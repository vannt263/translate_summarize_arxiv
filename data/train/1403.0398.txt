    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are widely accepted as the results of thermonuclear explosion of accreting carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath101.4 m@xmath11 ) in a binary system @xcite .",
    "they play important roles in many aspects of astrophysics , especially in observational cosmology because of their use as distance indicators probing the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "observationally , most of the sne ia show strikingly similar photometric and spectroscopic behavior ( i.e. , @xcite ) , and the remained scatter can be better understood in terms of an empirical relation between light - curve width and luminosity ( i.e. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , there is increasing evidence for the observed diversity that can not be explained with such a relation .",
    "the representative subclasses include : ( 1 ) overluminous group like sn 1991 t characterized by weak absorption and prominent iron in the near - maximum light spectra @xcite ; ( 2 ) underluminous events like sn 1991bg that exhibit strong @xmath65972 and @xmath104000  ti features ( i.e.,@xcite ) ; ( 3 ) peculiar objects like sn 2002cx which have extremely low ejecta velocities and luminosities @xcite ; ( 4 ) super - chandrasekhar mass sne ia like sn 2007if @xcite and sn 2009dc@xcite , which are characteristic of extremely high luminosity but relatively low expansion velocity .",
    "in addition , there are also reports of circumstellar interaction in some sne ia such as sn 2002ic @xcite and ptf 11kx @xcite , though their classifications are still controversial because of bearing similarities to type iin supernovae .",
    "the existence of above peculiar subtypes indicate that there are possibly multiple channels leading to sn  ia explosions .    besides peculiar sn ia events , specific classification schemes",
    "have recently been proposed to highlight the diversity of relatively normal sne ia .",
    "for example , @xcite found that normal sne ia can be further subclassified by the temporal velocity gradient of the @xmath66355 line , i.e. , the group with a high - velocity gradient ( hvg ) and the group with a low - velocity gradient ( lvg ) .",
    "based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the absorption features of @xmath65972 and @xmath66355 , @xcite suggested dividing the sn ia sample into four groups : cool ( cl ) , shallow silicon ( ss ) , core normal ( cn ) , and broad line ( bl ) ; the cl and ss groups mainly consist of peculiar objects like sn 1991bg and sn 1991 t , respectively .",
    "@xcite proposed using the expansion velocity of the @xmath6 6355 line to distinguish the subclass with a higher velocity ( hv ) from that with a normal velocity ( nv ) . in spite of different criteria adopted in these classifications ,",
    "the respective subsamples show some overlap with each other .",
    "for example , the faint subclass from @xcite tend to match the sn 1991bg / cl subclass .",
    "the hv subclass overlap with the bl and the hvg ones , as suggested by the berkeley and cfa spectral datasets of supernova @xcite . in particular , the hv sne ia are found to have redder @xmath12 colors @xcite and different locations within host galaxies in comparison to the nv ones @xcite , suggesting that the properties of their progenitors may be different .",
    "sn 2012fr is a type ia supernova discovered at a relatively young phase in nearby galaxy ngc 1365 @xcite .",
    "owing to its brightness , extensive follow - up observations were performed in multi - wavebands for this object immediately after the discovery .",
    "childress et al . ( 2013 , hereafter c13 ) have presented observations of earlier optical spectra for sn 2012fr , showing clear signatures of high - velocity features ( hvfs ) that are detached from the photospheric components . after comparing with subclasses of sne ia defined in different classification schemes",
    ", they suggested that sn 2012fr may represent a transitional event between nominal spectroscopic subclasses of sn ia , with important dissimilarities with the overluminous sn 1991t - like subclass of sne ia .",
    "@xcite presented the spectropolarimetric observations of this object , spanning from @xmath1311 days to + 24 days with respect to @xmath0-band maximum light .",
    "they found that the high - velocity components of the spectral features are highly polarized in the earlier phases but the polarization decreases as these features become weaker .",
    "however , the continuum polarization for the sn is always low @xmath140.1% , suggestive of an overall symmetry of the photosphere for sn 2012fr .    in this paper",
    ", we present extensive optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) observations of sn 2012fr .",
    "the large dataset of sn 2012fr can help us further understand diversity of sne ia , its physical origin , and impact on cosmological applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "all of the ccd images were reduced using the iraf standard procedure , including the corrections for bias , flat field , and removal of cosmic rays . as sn 2012fr was very bright and in a faint region of the host galaxy ( see figure 1 ) , we skipped the step of subtracting the galaxy template in the photometry . the standard point - spread function ( psf )",
