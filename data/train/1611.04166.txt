    "in a static homogeneous magnetic field , the orbit of a charged particle is a combination of rotation around the field lines and a translation along the field lines . with an inhomogeneous static magnetic field ,",
    "two general magnetic trap configurations can be considered : the first is the open field line configuration , where the magnetic field lines are closed outside the plasma .",
    "this configuration must display a minimum of a trapping potential along the open field lines to restrict the parallel motion and to achieve confinement . for non - neutral plasma in penning trap",
    "this potential is electrostatic . for thermonuclear quasi - neutral plasma , this potential",
    "is associated with the diamagnetic force leading to magnetic mirroring .",
    "the second magnetic confinement trap , and the topic of interest here , features closed field lines , that is to say , a toroidal topology .",
    "we will call @xmath0 the major radius of the plasma torus , @xmath1 the minor radius of this torus and @xmath2 the magnetic field on the magnetic axis .",
    "there is no need to create a minimum of a potential along the field lines , as particles explore the full length of the line .",
    "but we have to compensate the magnetic toroidal vertical drift velocity @xmath3 across the field lines , @xmath4 where @xmath5 the velocity along the field lines , @xmath6 the cyclotron velocity around the field lines and @xmath7 is the cyclotron frequency of a particle with charge @xmath8 and mass @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the temperature of the associated population .",
    "there are two ways to compensate this vertical drift :    ( _ i _ ) this compensation can be achieved with the magnetic rotational transform  @xcite which short circuits the vertical drift current associated with eq .",
    "( [ vdrift ] ) , thus providing steady state confinement .",
    "stellarators and tokamak are the two main configurations designed according to this principle  @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that , in particular tokamak equilibria referred to as _ current hole _ configurations , the magnetic rotational transform can be achieved with zero toroidal current and poloidal magnetic field on axis  @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) instead of using a poloidal magnetic field , the short circuiting of the vertical drift current can be achieved through a radial electric field @xmath11 , resulting in an @xmath12 poloidal rotation .",
    "this configuration also avoids the vertical magnetic escape described by eq .",
    "( [ vdrift ] ) .",
    "this is the principle of toroidal _ magnetoelectric _ confinement  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the difficulty to generate and control a radial electric field inside a hot plasma , electric rotation schemes have been far less explored than magnetic rotational transforms which underlie the basic field configurations of tokamak and stellarators .",
    "the electric rotation schemes previously considered envisioned rotational transform only near the plasma periphery .",
    "four decades ago , t.  h.  stix identified  @xcite , described and analyzed  @xcite a toroidal trap based on a purely toroidal magnetic field supplemented by a radial electric field localized near the edge of the plasma and sustained by a preferential loss of fast ions .",
    "the orbit in such a trap comprises a vertical drift @xmath3 near the center of the discharge , closed by an electric @xmath12 rotation at the edge .",
    "these d shaped orbits , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , are closed by the @xmath12 rotation on the low field side or on the high field side depending on the sign of the charge .",
    "stix studied the self - consistent equilibrium and the main instabilities associated with this original trap  @xcite .",
    "the impact of edge biasing was studied experimentally , with edge electrodes , in what was called an electric tokamak program  @xcite .",
    "edge electrodes produced observable effects on plasma confinement in tokamaks @xcite .",
    "the impact of electric rotation in various toroidal configurations was also analyzed  @xcite .",
    "electric rotation to overcome drifts was likewise analyzed , both theoretically and experimentally , within the context of particle accelerators  @xcite and non - neutral plasma confinement  @xcite .    to produce single - particle confinement ,",
    "here we explore the possibility to replace essentially completely the poloidal magnetic field ( and with it the toroidal current ) by a radial electric field ( radial polarization ) extending from the magnetic axis toward the edge .",
    "the scheme proposed here is different from the stix proposal and related configurations in two important respects : ( _ i _ ) here we consider a radial electric field extending from the center toward the edge rather than just near the edge ; and , relatedly , ( _ ii _ ) , here we consider a volumetric wave - driven electric field , through angular momentum absorption , rather than relying on preferential ions losses at the edge or edge biasing .",
    "we demonstrate that , for the purpose of single particle confinement , steady - state , wave - driven , electric field generation is more efficient than the classical wave - driven toroidal current schemes  @xcite , both in terms of energy storage and , at least in the limit of large aspect ratio , power dissipation .",
    "we call this new confinement scheme the _ wave - driven rotating torus _ , or , what we refer to more compactly as , the _",
    "wdrt_.    to estimate the potential of wdrt toroidal confinement , where there is no poloidal magnetic field , we consider the classical tokamak with a poloidal magnetic field as a benchmark case .",
    "for the same toroidal magnetic field @xmath2 and major / minor radius , @xmath13 , we set up a comparative analysis of the confined orbits when the vertical drift is compensated : the compensation occurs either ( _ i _ ) with a poloidal magnetic field ( tokamak ) , or ( _ ii _ ) with a radial electric field ( wdrt ) . for definiteness , we consider a radial electric field or a poloidal magnetic field increasing linearly with minor radius . in either case , such a field produces solid body rotation . by matching a single parameter",
    ", we can show that the orbits display the same confinement geometry in both the electric and magnetic cases .",
    "this provides a robust comparative criteria between wdrt and tokamak schemes .",
    "this criteria will then be used to compare the energy content and the power requirement of both wave - driven steady - state confinement schemes .",
    "the study here is limited to comparing reactive energy storage and active power consumption associated with wave - driven poloidal magnetic field generation versus wave - driven radial electric field generation for orbit confinement .",
    "pressure equilibrium is not addressed here , nor are fluid and kinetic instabilities .",
    "these are all critical issues to address . however , it is our hope that the unusual and attractive properties of the wdrt identified here , both in terms of reactive energy storage and power consumption , will motivate exploration of the important issues not covered here .",

    "we show here that it is possible to satisfy simultaneously both closed orbits and small horizontal displacements . on the one hand",
    ", the radial electric field must be large enough to produce a rotational transform sufficient to overcome the vertical drift .",
    "on the other hand , the electric field must not be quite that large so as to produce open orbits through inertial drifts .    in rotating plasma , both centrifugal forces and coriolis forces",

    "this very strong ordering allows one to chose easily an electric field @xmath108 , large enough to insure confinement ( @xmath66 ) , and yet small enough to avoid inertial drifts ( @xmath117 ) , far below the brillouin limit .",
    "the two conditions , ( _ i _ ) confinement through the requirement of closed orbits with small shift @xmath118 and ( _ ii _ ) negligible inertial drift effect , can thus be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "we address now the confinement and thermalization of energetic alpha particles in a wdrt trap .",
    "the considerations for energetic alpha particles are somewhat different than for plasma ions and electrons .",

    "an estimate of the various terms ( @xmath126 ) then gives an upper bound to the radial extent of the thermonuclear alpha particles : @xmath127    thus , an edge to center voltage drop around one mv ensures thermal confinement and avoids inertial drifts .",

    "note that the heating of the alpha particles , mainly by collisions with electrons , will also be uniform on iso - potential surfaces .",
    "even if slowing down takes place preferentially on the low field side ( or the high field side ) due a horizontal displacement , the fast circular motion of thermal particles will ensure homogeneous energy deposition on the iso - potential surfaces .",

    "let us compare now , when eq .",
    "@xmath132 is satisfied , the energy content associated with the radial electric field @xmath108 and the poloidal magnetic field @xmath32 .",
    "this energy content is a major source of free energy able to feed instabilities . while more detailed considerations are of course necessary , the energy content is important since we expect that , the lower the energy content , the more stable the configuration might tend to be and the least damaging might be any plasma disruption .    the energy content ratio can obtained on the basis of eq .",
    "@xmath132 , with the polarization energy associated with the radial permittivity of the plasma @xmath135 .",
    "the amount of energy needed to construct a radial electric field @xmath108 is then given by @xmath136 here we used the low frequency ion permittivity , @xmath137 = @xmath138 ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the ion plasma and ion cyclotron frequencies ) . note that the low frequency ion permittivity captures both the electric energy content as well as the kinetic energy content through the rotation .",
    "the ratio of the energy content to the magnetic energy in the equivalent tokamak content @xmath141 , needed for the same orbital confinement properties , is thus given by : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the beta parameter of the tokamak , the ratio of thermal energy to magnetic energy , which must be far smaller than one ( typically less than 0.04 for a tokamak ) .",
    "this result is very favorable to the electric option compared to the magnetic one .",
    "although we do not address directly instabilities , or the transport of heat and particles through collisions , and particularly through turbulence , a field configuration with less free energy in the confining fields is promising .",
    "it suggests that there may be less energy in any rearrangement of the magnetic surfaces in the plasma , together with their imbedded electric charge or toroidal current .",
    "it suggests weaker turbulent activity , since the free energy drive for the instabilities , besides the thermal and particle gradients , is the free energy content of the plasma .",
    "however , the comparative study of the main instabilities associated with a poloidal magnetic field configuration with respect to a radial electric field configuration is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here we content ourselves with noting that the relatively low free energy content is clearly promising in limiting the supply of energy to any instabilities associated with the wave - driven electric rotational transforms , while acknowledging that only a detailed analysis will ascertain whether this is in fact so .",
    "the energy storage consideration is only part of the story ; another key consideration is the power it takes to sustain the plasma fields . since the plasma is a dissipative media , both the radial electric field and",
    "the poloidal and magnetic field require power to persist . in order to maintain a poloidal magnetic field",
    ", charge must be transported along the magnetic field . in order to maintain a radial electric field",
    ", charge must be transported perpendicular to the magnetic field . in either case",
    ", it is anticipated that these fields may be maintained in the steady state by injecting waves into the plasma .",
    "the transport of charge parallel to the magnetic field by rf waves is covered under the general theory of current drive by rf waves @xcite .",
    "in general , the current drive can be efficient through waves that provide toroidal momentum to the electrons or alter the collisionality of fast electrons @xcite , which gives about the same efficiency .",
    "the transport of charge perpendicular to the magnetic field can occur in a variety of ways .",
    "it can happen by providing toroidal momentum to electrons , which normally would support the toroidal current , but , if trapped , instead drift towards the magnetic axis @xcite .",
    "the radial transport can also result from imparting perpendicular wave momentum to electrons @xcite , a mechanism that has been adduced to explain toroidal rotation by lower hybrid waves through generation of a radial electric field .    to compare the power dissipated in these cases , consider a simple plasma slab model with an homogeneous magnetic field directed along the @xmath14 axis and an electromagnetic plane wave propagating in the @xmath59 plane and interacting with a magnetized charged particle with charge @xmath8 and mass @xmath9 .",
    "the wave is a periodic function of time and space described by the classical factor @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a set of cartesian coordinates .",
    "two regimes of interaction between this wave and a charged particle are to be considered .",
    "( _ i _ ) the adiabatic regime where the energy / momentum exchange between the wave and the particle is small and reversible .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the resonant regime , when there exist an integer @xmath147 such that both the wave and the particle satisfy the relation : @xmath148 , where the exchanges are irreversible and large .",
    "the regime of interest here is the resonant one .",
    "when a resonant interaction takes place , energy , linear and angular momentum are exchanged between the wave and the particle .",
    "this exchange results in a change of the energy @xmath149 , the parallel momentum @xmath43 and the cyclotron velocity @xmath6 of the particle , but also of the guiding center position @xmath150 , since part of the momentum is no longer free but bound to the static magnetic field through the invariance of the canonical momentum along @xmath151 .",
    "this change in the guiding center position provides orbital angular momentum deposition inside a magnetized plasma column and radial current generation .",
    "appendix  [ sec : appc ] reviews the classical hamilton equations leading to the relations between energy , momentum and guiding center dynamics , which can be summarized by the set  ( [ eq : c7]-[eq : c10 ] ) of equations : @xmath152 where the energy variation @xmath153 can be expressed as a function of @xmath154 , the steady state power transferred from the wave to the particle , simply as , @xmath155 .",

    "these results are not surprising ; in a magnetized plasma , momentum transfer along the field lines results in a force and momentum transfer perpendicular to the field lines results in a velocity .",
    "in steady state , both the radial velocity @xmath159 and toroidal force @xmath160 , driven by resonant waves , are balanced by collisions . the associated charge and momentum balances",
    "allows us to express @xmath108 and @xmath32 as functions of the total absorbed wave power , thus defining the efficiencies of the generation processes .",

    "the dissipation mechanism for @xmath165 is less direct to calculate .",
    "we specialize to the limit of large aspect ratio , where the torus can be approximated as plasma column . in a rotating plasma column ,",
    "absent centrifugal forces , electrons and ions would rotate at the same velocity .",
    "however , the difference in centrifugal forces leads to a differential in rotation velocities .",
    "the friction between electrons and ions then leads to power dissipation",
    ". this will give the minimum power dissipated ; additional dissipation can be expected in a finite aspect ratio torus .    in an infinite homogeneous fully ionized magnetized plasma ,",
    "the collisions between electrons and ions are unable to dissipate a steady electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field because the @xmath183 cross @xmath184 drift is ambipolar , conservative ( @xmath185 ) and does not provide the relative velocity between ions and electrons needed for friction and dissipation .",
    "on the other hand , in an inhomogeneous fully ionized magnetized plasma , perpendicular conductivity is associated with the gradient and shear of the @xmath183 cross @xmath184 velocity .",
    "these gradient and shear arise from the inertia and viscosity terms in the steady state sum of the ions momentum balance plus the electrons momentum balance @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the viscous stress tensor , and a uniform density has been assumed . in this momentum balance , the pressure force , which is responsible for the diamagnetic currents , has been neglected since no pressure dynamics is driven by the electric field .",

    "the opposite occurs , with the ions shifted outward in major radius , and the electrons inward .",
    "equivalently , consider two horizontal cylinders with the same axis and the same radius : one is filled with hydrogen ions of charge @xmath8 and density @xmath416 and the other with electrons of charge @xmath417 and density @xmath416 . if the two axes , while remaining parallel and in the same horizontal plane , are slightly separated by a distance @xmath418 , an internal horizontal uniform electric field of strength @xmath419 is generated and an external dipolar field appears .",
    "thus , even if @xmath420 , a horizontal separation of charges takes place , leading to a weak horizontal polarization .",
    "the horizontal polarization leads to a vertical @xmath104 drift , in which both electrons and ions together drift upward or downward out of the torus.to avoid this electric polarization , the edge space charge , due to the sign dependance of @xmath118 , needs to be short circuited in a wdrt trap .",
    "however , since the horizontal drift is weak , the rotational transform that stabilizes the vertical drifts will also stabilize the horizontal drifts . to the extent that any residual polarization remains , there exist several possibilities to counteract those polarizations , or possibly even utilize the polarizations for positive purposes .",
    "one , consider that the upper bound of the thickness of this edge space charge is of the order the fast ion larmor radius .",
    "this allows charge to be scraped off the peripheral flux surface .",
    "in fact , this task can be performed simultaneously with particle and power extraction at the edge .",
    "also , if a very small amount of internal , or external , toroidal current is driven to define non degenerate magnetic surfaces adjusted to iso - potential surfaces , a divertor x point can be created and the associated sol thickness can be adjusted to @xmath118 to solve both polarization and power extraction problems at the same time .",
    "two , and related to the first possibility , consider that the orbits which give rise to the horizontal field @xmath421 are edge orbits ( @xmath422 ) . as such , they correspond to the cold part of the discharge and can be intercepted by left and right limiters which can be connected externally to short circuit this polarization . a small amount of edge poloidal magnetic field can also provide a short circuit path along the helicoidal field lines to cancel horizontal polarization .",
    "three , it is also possible to counteract the polarization with a wave - driven horizontal current . the efficiency of the perpendicular current generation is larger than that of parallel current generation , so that the power cost of this additional wave driven current will be small .",
    "thus , horizontal polarization can be cancelled through a stripping of the cold edge orbits with an x point / sol divertor configuration or with limiters , or short circuited with wave - driven internal horizontal or poloidal currents .",
    "note that the external draining of the space charge with limiters or a sol provides a direct energy recovery process , whereas the internal wave - driven short circuit requires additional power . on the other hand ,",
    "the steady - state stripping of the edge cold orbits is in any event mandatory for all toroidal thermonuclear traps , even without horizontal polarization , to remove fusion ash and heat .",
