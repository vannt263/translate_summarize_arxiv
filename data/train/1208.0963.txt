    "single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , such as mn@xmath1 ( see refs . ) and fe@xmath2 ( see refs . ) , have become the focus of intense research since experiments on bulk samples demonstrated the magnetic quantum tunneling of a single magnetic moment on a macroscopic scale .",
    "these molecules are characterized by a large total spin , a large magnetic anisotropy barrier , and anisotropy terms which allow the spin to tunnel through the barrier .",
    "it is well known that magnetic quantum coherence ( mqc ) is realized when the smm tunnels several times between degenerate spin states with opposite spin projections on the magnetic easy axis before the coherence is destroyed by the environment .",
    "evidence of mqc has been reported for various superconducting systems and for antiferromagnetic nanoclusters .",
    "@xcite + electronic transport through smms offers several unique features with potentially large impact on applications such as high - density magnetic storage as well as quantum computing.@xcite recent experiments have pointed out the importance of the interference between spin tunneling paths in molecules . for instance , measurements of the magnetization in bulk fe@xmath2 have observed oscillations in the tunnel splitting @xmath3 between states @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of a transverse magnetic field at temperatures between @xmath6 k and @xmath7 k ( see ref . ) . this effect can be explained by the interference between berry phases associated to spin tunneling path of opposite windings.@xcite + in this article we investigate coherent magnetic quantum tunneling in the smm ni@xmath0 in which the tunneling rate is faster than the rate of decoherence and at a temperature at which tunneling occurs only between the lowest spin states .",
    "we have chosen to study the smm ni@xmath0 because of its high symmetry ( s@xmath0 ) and large tunnel splittings ( @xmath8 0.01k ) at zero magnetic field , which have been confirmed by high frequency epr and magnetic relaxation experiments ( see ref . ) .",
    "the total spin ground state of ni@xmath0 is @xmath9 .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows .",
    "first we will start with the model hamiltonian of the ni@xmath0 molecular transistor taking into account the magnetic quantum coherence of the two lowest ground spin states of the smm .",
    "then we will solve this model hamiltonian and use the solution to calculate the conductance through the molecular transistor as a function of the applied bias by means of the landauer formalism at zero temperature for the smm ni@xmath0 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the total anderson - type hamiltonian of a system formed by a single - molecule magnet ( smm ) attached to two metallic leads can be separated into three terms @xmath10 we will consider the leads as a one dimensional linear chain of sites .",
    "thus , the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : htotal ] ) is given by , @xmath11 where the operator @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) creates ( annihilates ) electronic states in the leads with spin orientation @xmath14 , and energy @xmath15 .",
    "the symbol @xmath16 implies the sum over nearest neighbors .",
    "the potential of the wire is taken to be zero and the hopping in the wire is @xmath17 .",
    "the on site energies in the leads and in the smm are given by @xmath18_{\\sigma\\sigma}$ ] and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the zeeman energy splitting in the leads where @xmath21 is the pauli matrix.@xcite + the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : htotal ] ) denotes the smm part , which can be broken into spin , charging , and gate contributions , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the charging energy , @xmath24 is the number of excess electrons ( the charge state of the molecule ) , and @xmath25 is the electric potential due to an external gate voltage . in the presence of an external magnetic field , the spin hamiltonian of the smm ni@xmath0 reads @xmath26 where the easy axis is taken along the @xmath27 direction and @xmath28 .",
    "the magnetic field components were rescaled to @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the transversal and longitudinal parts , respectively , where @xmath31 denotes the effective gyromagnetic ratio for the giant spin of the smm and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the total spin as well as the anisotropy constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the charging state of the molecule , i.e. if the smm is singly and doubly charged.@xcite the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath36 tilts the double potential well favoring those spin projections aligned with the field . at zero magnetic field the spin projections @xmath37 and @xmath38 have nearly the same energy and magnetic quantum tunneling is possible .",
    "importantly , for an individual ni@xmath0 nanomagnet quantum magnetic tunneling is possible only between states that differ by 4 spin units , i.e. if the selection rule @xmath39 is satisfied , where @xmath40 is an integer.@xcite the transverse magnetic field in the @xmath41 plane lifts the degeneracy of the eigenstates of @xmath42 by an energy @xmath43 , the so - called tunnel splitting , and leads to states that are coherent superpositions of the eigenstates of @xmath42 . denoting @xmath44",
    "as the coupling matrix element between the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the magnetic quantum coherence in the single molecule magnet is given by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath47 where @xmath44 represents the source of spin flipping .",
    "the most general coherent superpositions for the two lowest levels @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 note that when @xmath50 in eq.([eqsym ] ) then @xmath51 , which means that there is only one conducting channel open if there is no magnetic quantum coherence .",
    "to take advantage of the coherent superposition in eq.([eqsym ] ) we need to singly charge the smm ni@xmath0 in order to switch the total spin ground state from @xmath9 to @xmath52 or @xmath53 , the final ground state will be the result of the exchange interaction between the total spins in the smm . when the nanomagnet is singly charged and with the application of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath36 the smm will only allow electrons with spin down ( up ) polarization in single electron tunneling transport due to spin blockade .",
    "if the smm has a total spin ground state of @xmath52 or @xmath53 , then there will be transitions from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and from @xmath56 to @xmath55 , respectively . for @xmath52 spin up",
    "electrons are transmitted through the smm , whereas for @xmath53 spin down electrons are transmitted through the smm .",
    "the energy levels as a function of the orientation of the magnetic moment is pictorially shown in figure ( [ scheme ] ) , where the gap between @xmath57 and @xmath58 has been exaggerated to help visualization of the electron transmission through the smm transistor .",

    "interestingly , if @xmath70 or @xmath50 then @xmath71 and there is no spin - flip processes .",
    "this shows that magnetic quantum coherence and the coupling between the states @xmath62 opens a new channel for the electron to tunnel through the molecular transistor which interferes with the direct channel .",
    "in what follows we present our results for the spin dependent conductance .",

    "if the lead - molecule tunneling amplitude is weak then a small fraction of the electrons will have a spin - flip process and the interference between different tunneling trajectories will not be strong . on the other hand , as the lead - molecule tunneling amplitude increases the interference between different paths",
    "is enhanced , therefore , the shift in the peaks is due to the spin - flip processes in the electron transmission .",
