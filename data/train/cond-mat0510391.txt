    "in order to develop and maintain tissues , cells in multicellular organisms have to interact with each other and the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) . cellular communication proceeds mainly through specific interactions provided by receptor - ligand binding . in solution , gradients in ligand concentration encode spatial information .",
    "for example , morphogen gradients guide cell differentiation @xcite , and gradients of chemoattractants or chemorepellants direct cell motility ( _ chemotaxis _ ) @xcite . for cells adhering to each other or to the ecm",
    ", physical properties of the environment like topography and mechanics provide additional information supplementing specific biochemical cues .",
    "in particular , cells in their natural environment typically orient along fiber bundles of the ecm , a principle termed _ contact guidance _ @xcite . in general , cells preferentially orient along directions with minimal curvature @xcite .",
    "while contact guidance provides only a bidirectional cue for cell migration , unidirectional cues result from spatial gradients in adhesiveness ( _ haptotaxis _ ) @xcite , substrate rigidity ( _ durotaxis _ ) @xcite and substrate tension ( _ tensotaxis _ ) @xcite .",
    "tissue cells like fibroblasts in the connective tissue constantly remodel their structural environment by degrading old and secreting new ecm .",
    "moreover they can exert forces large enough to actively reorganize the ecm after it has been laid down @xcite .",
    "hence , cells not only respond to the physical properties of their environment , but also actively modulate them .",
    "this results in indirect , matrix - mediated interactions between cells . in particular",
    ", cell traction - induced reorganization of collagen fibers can mediate a mechanical interaction between cells via contact guidance @xcite . in the same vein",
    ", elastic interactions between cells can result from stress and strain in the ecm induced by cell traction . during recent years",
    ", the sophisticated use of elastic substrates has proven that cells indeed respond to purely elastic features in their environment , including rigidity , rigidity gradients and prestrain @xcite .",
    "it now appears that many cell types , including fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells , and endothelial cells ( but not neutrophils or neurons ) , respond to the mechanical properties of their environment with a common preference for large effective stiffness @xcite . here",
    "the term _ effective stiffness _ comprises both rigidity of and tensile strain in the environment , which can be actively sensed by cells via mechanotransductory processes at cell - matrix adhesions @xcite .",
    "these mechanical cues play an important role in a variety of physiological processes , including development , tissue maintenance , angiogenesis , myotube fusion , wound healing and metastasis @xcite .",
    "in particular , if coupled to cell division , stress and strain become major determinants of tissue morphogenesis @xcite . in general ,",
    "tissue function arises from the close relationship between cell behaviour in and material properties of the ecm @xcite .",
    "we have argued before that elastic interactions contribute to the way single cells position and orient themselves in compliant environments @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been discussed in detail before how this individual behaviour translates into collective behaviour of cell ensembles in compliant environments . in a recent short report",
    "we have shown that elastically interacting cells assemble into strings of cells which then leads to screening of the cellular traction patterns @xcite .",
    "although this effect in principle suppresses macroscopic order , we have also found that macroscopic order can exist at high cell density , with an interesting competition between string- and ring - like structures as a function of the poisson ratio of the surrounding material . in our recent report",
    ", this effect has been especially analyzed for ordered ( lattice ) arrangements of cells , which can be decomposed into strings .",
    "since cellular systems are intrinsically noisy , in this paper we focus on stochastic effects using extensive monte carlo simulations , which allow to predict collective effects in the presence of noise . in the following ,",
    "we mainly consider the case of cells adhering to the top of a soft elastic substrate , because this setup might be the easiest way to experimentally verify our theoretical predictions .",
    "commonly used materials for elastic substrates are polyacrylamide or polydimethylsiloxane , which can be described by linear isotropic elasticity theory .",
    "since we are interested in the interactions mediated by an elastic environment , we only consider situations without cell - cell contact , which experimentally could trigger different cellular responses to mechanical signals .",
    "therefore in our theoretical work we first fix cell positions and then relax cellular orientations using standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "experimentally , this might be done by using microcontact printing , thus restricting cells to adhesive islands , or by using non - motile cell lines , which adhere at random positions and then do not move . by freezing in cell positions , we are also able to control cell density . for the position geometry , we consider ordered ( lattice ) arrangements , random perturbations around ordered positions and arrangements which are completely random .",
    "we calculate structural phase diagrams as a function of of elastic moduli , cell density , noise and cell position geometry using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we then briefly investigate collective elastic effects in three dimensional elastic environments and finally discuss our results in the context of wound healing .",
    "in order to sense the mechanical properties of their environment , tissue cells pull on it with actomyosin contractility . in many cases ,",
    "this contractile mechanical activity is directed along the long axis of the cell body , especially when confronted with a mechanically anisotropic environment .",
    "the mechanical action of such an anisotropic force pattern can be modeled as an anisotropic force contraction dipole @xmath0 , where the unit vector @xmath1 specifies cell orientation .",
    "in contrast to electric dipoles in electrostatics , which are vectors , force dipoles in elasticity theory are tensors of rank two .",
    "@xmath2 specifies the dipole strength , which typically has @xmath3 j , corresponding to two opposing forces @xmath4 nn separated by a distance @xmath5 @xmath6 m @xcite .",
    "we will consider cells with anisotropic force patterns only and assume that the magnitude @xmath2 is constant for all cells .",
    "a mechanically active cell generates an elastic strain field @xmath7 , which again is a tensor of rank two .",
    "the strain induced by @xmath2 can be calculated from the elastic green tensor @xmath8 which describes the deformation of the medium at @xmath9 caused by a point force at @xmath10 . in general",
    "@xmath11 depends on material properties and boundary conditions . for translationally invariant situations , one has @xmath12 .",
    "elastic interactions between two cells result if the mechanical activity @xmath13 of one cell responds to the elastic field @xmath14 induced by another cell . in the framework of a general field theory elastic interaction",
    "can then be represented by a coupling of @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "since cells are active and moreover often show a regulated response , the exact form of the coupling between @xmath13 and @xmath14 can not be predicted from first principles . in a first order approximation",
    "we may assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are linearly coupled .",
    "for mechanically active cells like fibroblasts , experimental observations suggest that indeed they adopt positions and orientations in such a way as to effectively minimize the scalar quantity @xmath15 @xcite . for tensile strain , this implies that contractile cells actively align with the external field . because they pull against the external stretch , cells reduce displacement . for fibroblast - like cells ,",
    "this behaviour might have evolved in the context of wound healing , when cell traction is required to close wounds .",
    "a biophysical interpretation of the origin of the extremum principle regarding @xmath16 is to note that @xmath16 has dimensions of energy .",
    "physically @xmath16 can be interpreted as an extra energy contribution to the deformation energy required to build up a force dipole in the presence of strain @xmath14 @xcite . using the analogy of a harmonic spring",
    "the basic idea can be explained easily : for a given spring constant @xmath17 , it takes the work @xmath18 to build up the force @xmath19",
    ". therefore larger stiffness @xmath17 corresponds to smaller work @xmath16 required to reach the force @xmath19 . in this way",
    "@xmath16 may be interpreted as the inverse of an effective stiffness of the environment and the extremum principle in @xmath16 corresponds to the experimental observation that cell - matrix contacts grow stronger in a stiff environment , thus eventually determining cell orientation . using this extremum principle ,",
    "we have been able before to unify many diverse observations which have been reported for the organization of single cells on elastic substrates and in physiological hydrogels @xcite .",
    "for example , it predicts that single cells prefer to align in parallel and perpendicular to free and clamped surfaces of finite sized samples , respectively .",
    "it is however important to note that the cellular response to the actively sensed effective stiffness of the environment is very different from the cellular response to cyclic external stretch with a 1 hz frequency , which is relevant for the physiology of lung tissue and the cardiovascular system . in this case , many cell types tend to orient away from the direction of stretch @xcite , possibly to avoid the recurrent deformation of their cytoskeleton .    for two cells , the above reasoning leads to the following effective interaction potential @xcite @xmath20 where we consider only situations with translational invariance .",
    "the optimal cell configuration is described by the minimum of @xmath16 in regard to cell positioning and orientation . since in general @xmath21 scales as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is distance and",
    "@xmath24 an elastic modulus , @xmath16 scales as @xmath25 and has units of energy . since in a linear material",
    "the cellular strain fields superimpose , the functional that describes elastic interactions of a system of @xmath26 cells reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the interaction between two cells @xmath29 and @xmath30 as described in .",
    "the factor @xmath31 is required to avoid double counting and the factor @xmath32 for _ per cell _ normalization .",
    "the optimal structure is given by the configuration which minimizes as a function of all cellular orientations and positions and we may refer to this structure as the _ ground state _ , in analogy to interacting passive particles in physical systems .      in the presence of noise any system will deviate from its optimal state . in the cellular systems discussed here , noise results both from intracellular processes ( like the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression and signal transduction ) and from heterogeneities in the material properties of the environment . in order to introduce a stochastic element into the structure formation process",
    ", we perform monte carlo simulations using the standard metropolis algorithm to generate typical configurations in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "this implies the use of an gibbs ensemble , which in our case is the simplest choice given that we do not know the exact details of the cellular decision making process ( in information theory , the gibbs ensemble arises from maximizing the measure for disorder ( _ shannon entropy _ ) under the constraint of a prescribed average energy ) .",
    "starting from an arbitrary configuration , a cell is selected at random and its orientation randomly varied .",
    "the new configuration is always accepted when it decreases @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise it is accepted with the probability @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath35 is temperature . in our context",
    "@xmath36 represents a measure for the degree of stochasticity involved in cellular decision making .",
    "other studies on modelling cellular structure formation have used the same concept before and found an effective value of @xmath37 j @xcite . since this quantity comprises all molecular interactions between a cell and its environment , it is six orders of magnitudes larger than thermal energy . in our case",
    ", the competition between elastic and stochastic effects can be characterized by the reduced temperature @xmath38 which measures the relative importance of noise with respect to the average elastic interaction strength . here",
    "@xmath39 is the average distance between two cells which is related to the averaged cell density by @xmath40 in two dimensions ( 2d ) and by @xmath41 in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "as we will see below , typical values in our simulations range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . using @xmath44 j , @xmath45 kpa , @xmath46 m and a typical value @xmath47",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 j. therefore our choice for the noise level is exactly in the same range as the earlier estimates @xcite . as the effective temperature is decreased towards cero , @xmath49 , @xmath16 decreases and the ground states become increasingly favorable .",
    "this process is known as _ simulated annealing _ and is often used to identify optimal structures @xcite . in the vicinity of an optimal structure , almost all monte carlo moves are rejected .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath50 , every monte carlo move is accepted and the structures get disordered .",
    "one monte carlo sweep corresponds to @xmath26 such monte carlo moves .",
    "after thermal equilibration ( typically about @xmath51 monte carlo sweeps ) , the metropolis algorithm samples the important configurations typical for a given temperature @xmath52 .",
    "one can then calculate statistical properties of structures at defined noise level by averaging the quantity of interest over many configurations generated by the metropolis algorithm .    to study stochastic effects using our monte carlo simulations we typically consider @xmath53 dipoles .",
    "in order to minimize the effects of boundaries and finite size , we apply periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) , such that each dipole has the same number of next neighbors and experiences the same local geometry .",
    "we implement pbcs using the minimal image convention , i.e.  we only consider the interactions of the dipole with its @xmath54 nearest ( image ) dipoles @xcite .",
    "note that in the two - dimensional situation of cells on top of an elastic half space , the @xmath55 interaction effectively constitutes a _ short - ranged _ potential , because its area integral does not diverge with system size ( @xmath56 where @xmath57 is system size ) .",
    "thus , boundary effects are expected to play only a minor role in this case and the minimal image convention is a good approximation .",
    "we now make some additional assumptions which will simplify our subsequent calculations and which will allow for a direct comparison of our theoretical calculations with appropriate experiments .",
    "first , we assume that the environment can be described by isotropic linear elasticity theory , which is a reasonable assumption for the synthetic substrates like the ones made from polyacrylamide or polydimethylsiloxane commonly used to study mechanical effects in cell culture @xcite .",
    "thus there are two elastic constants : the young modulus @xmath24 describes the rigidity of the material and the poisson ratio @xmath58 the relative importance of compression and shear .",
    "in particular we mainly consider the situation of cells adhering to the top surface of a thick elastic film .",
    "such a situation can be theoretically represented by an elastic half - space geometry with dipolar orientations constrained to the x - y - plane .",
    "therefore the young modulus @xmath24 and the poisson ratio @xmath58 are 3d quantities .",
    "the maximal value for @xmath58 is @xmath31 , e.g.  for strongly hydrated polymer gels .",
    "if such a material is tensed in one direction , the shear mode is excited and it contracts in the perpendicular directions ( _ poisson effect _ ) . for common materials ,",
    "the minimal value for the poisson ratio is @xmath59 , e.g. in dehydrated fibrous polymer gels .",
    "then the volume mode prevails and uniaxial tension does not translate into lateral contraction . for cells exerting tangential forces on top of an elastic substrate one can use the boussinesq green function of an elastic halfspace @xcite to specify to @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath23 is the distance between cells and the cellular orientations @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "are defined via the scalar products @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "secondly , because here we focus on elastic effects , we want to avoid cell - cell contacts , which are known to change the mechanical state of adhering cells @xcite .",
    "therefore we attribute an exclusion disc of radius @xmath71 to each cell .",
    "moreover in most of our simulations cell positions are frozen and only orientational degrees of freedom are considered .",
    "experimentally , this situation might be achieved by using non - motile cell lines or appropriate drugs to suppress cell motility .",
    "alternatively , one might use microcontact printing to prepare well - defined adhesive islands constraining cell positions .",
    "finally , while the focus of our paper is on structure formation on planar synthetic substrates to allow a direct comparison of theory and experiment , we also briefly consider cells in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) environment .",
    "for computational simplicity we keep the assumption of linear isotropic . for cells embedded in an infinite 3d isotropic elastic environment",
    ", the interaction law stays the same as , but with different constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 which now follow from the kelvin solution for the full elastic space @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "the elastic interactions are truly long - ranged , in the sense that now the volume integral over the elastic interaction diverges with system size ( @xmath74 where @xmath57 is system size ) , thus boundary effects become more important .",
    "we first consider structure formation in the presence of noise when cells adopt regular positions on an infinite square ( s ) and hexagonal ( h ) lattice . in general",
    "we find a strong dependence of structure formation on lattice geometry , poisson ratio @xmath58 and noise level @xmath52 .",
    "in particular our simulations show an interesting competition between _ string - like _ and _ ring - like _ structures at low noise levels , which we have also found before in a detailed analysis of optimal structures @xcite . for the square lattice low noise structures",
    "are always string - like .",
    "the lattice geometry favors the formation of strings directed along one of the principal lattice vectors @xmath75 or @xmath76 for all @xmath58 .",
    "the limit @xmath77 shows structural degeneracy , that is , additional structures , e.g.  parallel strings aligned along @xmath78 , become equally favored as parallel ( 1,0)-string structure .",
    "enhanced structural degeneracy of string - like structures in the limit of vanishing poisson ratio occurs also on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "most interestingly , however , on the hexagonal lattice string- and ring - like structures exchange stability as a function of poisson ratio . for @xmath79",
    "the poisson effect favors ring - like structures over strings , with rings composed of four dipoles each rotated by 90 degrees relatively to its neighbor . on both lattice types the orientational order imposed by elastic interactions",
    "is gradually destroyed with increasing noise levels .",
    "when elastic interactions dominate , dipoles typically fluctuate weakly around their optimal orientations forming long - ranged ordered structures . at intermediate noise levels ,",
    "long - ranged order is decreased , but there are still ordered domains which locally adjust to elastic signals . as noise increased further ,",
    "domain size decreases and local fluctuations become stronger , eventually giving eventually rise to completely random dipole arrangements .",
    "the loss of long - ranged order with increased noise can be quantified by calculating the temperature behavior of appropriate order parameters . for string - like structures",
    "all dipoles point along a common direction @xmath80 .",
    "a suitable parameter to quantify the degree of global alignment therefore seems to be the angle @xmath81 between dipole orientation @xmath1 and @xmath80 , where @xmath82 .",
    "note that force dipoles have a bipolar symmetry and thus dipole orientations @xmath1 and @xmath83 are equivalent .",
    "thus , the average @xmath84 .",
    "however , the average @xmath85 becomes one when all dipoles point along @xmath80 , while for an isotropic structure @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we define an alignment order parameter @xmath87 as @xmath88 which is non - zero only for globally aligned structures and zero otherwise . from our monte carlo simulations",
    "we compute @xmath87 as a function of @xmath52 and poisson ratio for both lattice types .",
    "as shown in a , on the square lattice a globally aligned structure @xmath89 always develops regardless of poisson ratio when the noise level becomes sufficiently low .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath90 from a state without into a state with long - ranged orientation correlations , i.e. where @xmath91 for the first time , decreases approximately linearly with @xmath58 .",
    "this might be attributed to the general enhancement of elastic interactions with increasing poisson ratio @xmath92 . in b",
    "we show how the probability distribution to find a dipole with a given orientation @xmath81 evolves with increasing noise levels . at low @xmath52",
    "almost all dipoles point along @xmath93 and the orientation distribution is strongly peaked ; with increasing @xmath52 the distribution broadens and finally for @xmath94 all orientations are - on a global scale - equally likely ( circle ) .",
    "in contrast to the square lattice , where long - ranged order always implies alignment , the type of long - ranged order developed on a hexagonal lattice depends on poisson ratio .",
    "c shows that an aligned structure develops only for @xmath95 .",
    "interestingly , in this case the relation between the transition temperature @xmath90 and poisson ratio is also reversed compared to the square lattice : @xmath90 stays roughly constant for @xmath96 and then drops quickly around @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , towards @xmath98 the transition seems to become more discontinuous and in our simulations @xmath87 suddenly jumps from a low to a large value , indicating bistability and a first order phase transition .",
    "the @xmath90 scaling with @xmath58 might be explained by simultaneous overall decrease in elastic signal strength with decreasing @xmath58 within strings compensated by an increase in lateral string - string coupling favoring global alignment at small @xmath58 . for larger poisson ratio ( @xmath99 )",
    "we find @xmath100 at all temperatures . at low @xmath101 a macroscopic isotropic long - ranged ring - like order exists build up by small rings composed of four dipoles oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other .",
    "that is , at @xmath102 there are two equally large subpopulations of dipoles oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other .",
    "this corresponds to the two peaks in the radial orientation distribution shown in d @xmath103 . for @xmath104 the transition temperature into the ordered ring - like structure @xmath90",
    "is slightly larger than @xmath105 and significantly lower than @xmath106 observed for the string structures on the square lattice at equal dipole densities .    in [ fig : ordered_square ] and [ fig : ordered_hex ] we summarize our results for ordered structures in the form of @xmath107 phase diagrams for square and hexagonal lattices , respectively .",
    "we have included representative snapshots of typical dipole configurations at noise levels well below @xmath90 in the globally ordered state , approximately at the phase transition @xmath90 and well above @xmath90 in the disordered phase for @xmath108 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that despite the loss of _ global _ order at elevated noise levels @xmath109 , elastic interactions still _ locally _ manifest themselves in characteristic domain formation .",
    "for example , at @xmath110 elastic interactions still cause local order on a square lattice and one finds short string - like domains preferentially oriented along the principal lattice vectors . on incompressible substrates ( @xmath111 )",
    "we furthermore often observe cooperative excitations and the formation of ring - like domains .",
    "this may reflect the competition between ring- and string - like domains which is modulated by the poisson ratio .",
    "in fact , as we have shown before , at @xmath104 ring - like structures are only slightly disfavoured with respect to the string - like structures @xcite . nevertheless , it may seem surprising that ring - like domains are excited so easily already at very low @xmath52 even before coexistence of the equally favorable ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) domains occurs ( see snapshot at @xmath112 ) .",
    "the reason is probably a large domain interface penalty for two ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) string domains compared to the interface penalty of a string and an adjacent ring - domain .    for the hexagonal lattice local structural characteristics of elastic interactions under noise are again string - like domains preferentially oriented along directions specified by lattice geometry . for large @xmath58 ,",
    "a characteristic signature for elastic interactions is the formation of 4-cell - ring or ladder - domains with cells having approximately perpendicular orientations with respect to each other .",
    "thus , although experimentally noise might be too strong to allow for global ordering , elastic interactions might be still detected by their local signatures of characteristic domain formation .",
    "experimentally cells may not adopt perfect lattice positions , in particular when adhesive islands are used which are large compared to cell size in order to minimize the effects of island shape on cellular force distribution @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate the effect of positional fluctuations at low thermal noise intensities . for this purpose",
    "we randomly displace the dipole positions within a circle of radius @xmath23 around the lattice positions before relaxing the orientations .",
    "the degree of positional disorder can be quantified by the ratio @xmath113 of the radius with respect to the lattice constant @xmath39 . in the following we focus on the square lattice and @xmath104 , since synthetic polymer gels typically have @xmath114 . for this value of the poisson ratio ,",
    "predicts a lattice geometry dependent transition from a string - like structure on a square lattice to a ring - like structure on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "however , rings are thermally excited easily on the square lattice .",
    "hence the string - like structure might also be easily destabilized under positional disorder .    in",
    "we show monte carlo snapshots at a low reduced temperature ( @xmath115 ) for @xmath116 .",
    "the simulations show that a 10@xmath117 deviation from the lattice positions has only a minor effect on orientational ordering . for @xmath118 , string - like as well as ring - like domains form and long - ranged orientational",
    "order disappears . as for thermal noise",
    ", ring - domains typically localize to interfaces between string - like domains with perpendicular orientations . with increasing @xmath67 domains shrink and structures appear increasingly disordered",
    ". thus , moderate deviations from the square lattice positions are not sufficient to destabilize string - like structures with respect to ring - like structures on incompressible substrates . possibly because under uniform positional noise dipoles still find themselves in a local fourfold coordination with other dipoles ( that is , each dipole has typically for next neighbors as on the square lattice ) , string domains are stabilized .",
    "we conclude that positional disorder affects structure formation in a similar way as increasing the temperature @xmath52 on a perfect lattice .      on a homogeneous substrate ,",
    "non - motile cells usually adhere more or less at random positions .",
    "therefore we next study typical structures on elastic substrates with completely randomized but fixed positions as described above .",
    "cellular structure formation on elastic substrates is now governed mainly by three control parameters , namely reduced temperature @xmath52 , poisson ratio @xmath58 and cell density . since in our model each cell is characterized by an exclusion radius @xmath71 , we introduce a reduced density @xmath119 which is a dimensionless variable describing the ratio of the area occupied by @xmath26 circular disks of radius @xmath71 to the area of the ( simulation ) box with length @xmath57 .",
    "shows typical snapshots of structures at @xmath115 for cells on an elastic substrate with @xmath120 ( top  bottom ) for @xmath121 ( left  right ) . at low densities cells",
    "predominantly optimize locally the interaction between them by forming short strings with no long - range correlation between string - like clusters .",
    "we attribute this finding to the strong tendency of dipoles to form strings and the strong elastic screening of string - string interactions @xcite .",
    "this results in rather robust pattern formation that does not differ qualitatively as the poisson ratio is varied , see a. one expects that these patterns represent typical cellular structures formed by strongly interacting cells when cells in dilute concentrations are suspended on an elastic substrate and adhere at random positions ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath123 the respective structures at low noise intensity show a strong dependence on the poisson ratio @xmath58 . for incompressible substrates ( @xmath111 )",
    "we find isotropic ring - like structures , see ( ivc ) . with decreasing poisson ratio",
    "string - like patterns emerge . for @xmath124",
    "we find coexistence of string - like and ring - like domains , compare ( iiic ) . for substrates with poisson ratio below @xmath125 string - like structures dominate at intermediate densities . with increasing density strings",
    "start to interact and domains of aligned parallel strings form which increase in size with increasing @xmath123 , see ( iib , iic ) .",
    "highly compressible substrates ( @xmath126 ) favor cell alignment along a common direction at high cell densities and in ( ic ) we find a globally aligned structure . here",
    ", the rotational symmetry of the structure is spontaneously broken along an arbitrary direction in space despite lacking long - ranged positional order . in this respect",
    "we may speak of a nematic structure in analogy to nematic phases formed by liquid crystals which are characterized by orientational order but positional disorder .    as before one can quantify the development of anisosotropic long - ranged order with the order parameter @xmath87 defined in . in contrast to the lattice structures where preferred string direction @xmath80 was determined by lattice geometry , the orientation of the director @xmath80 on homogeneous substrates is arbitrary .",
    "this is taken into account by defining a two - dimensional analog of the nematic order parameter @xmath87 used in the theory of liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the ordering matrix @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the orientation vector of the @xmath63th particle and the sum runs over all particles in the simulation box .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath129 of the symmetric ordering matrix @xmath130 corresponds then to the order parameter @xmath131 . as before @xmath87 measures the degree of orientational order with respect to the current director @xmath80 , which is the corresponding eigenvector to the maximal eigenvalue .",
    "@xmath132 implies nematic and @xmath100 isotropic structures .",

    "the general features of this phase diagram are very similar to the thermal phase diagram for hexagonal lattices shown in but with the role of @xmath52 and ( inverse ) density @xmath123 exchanged .",
    "note , that at @xmath135 dipoles in fact adopt hexagonal lattice positions , because disks must order into a hexagonal lattice due to the non - overlap constraint .",
    "thus , reducing the density from @xmath135 in our model is in some sense equivalent to introducing position fluctuations around hexagonal lattice positions ( see above ) , which qualitatively has similar consequences as raising the effective temperature .",
    "these results also show the importance of local position geometry and dipole coordination . at high @xmath123 dipoles have six next neighbors and all interactions are equal in magnitude . because elastic interactions are strongly anisotropic and dependent on poisson ratio , non - trivial structure formation as a function of local dipole coordination and poisson ratio results .",
    "decreasing @xmath123 the number of next neighbors decreases and at low @xmath123 dipoles typically only have one or two next neighbors , which favors dipole alignment and string formation . due to screening of the traction patterns in a string , adjacent strings hardly interact and we obtain a largely disordered structure even at low @xmath52 . in our calculations the degree of position correlation is controlled by @xmath123 , which therefore plays a similar role as lattice geometry before .",
    "in contrast to relative density effects described by @xmath123 , absolute density effects can be subsumed into the effective temperature @xmath52 , see .",
    "this is due to the fact that by _ increasing _ cell density the screening efficiency of string - string interactions also _ increases_. the only way to overcome screening and introduce lateral coupling between dipoles is to insure that dipole - dipole distances within a string and the distance to an adjacent string are comparable . increased dipole coordination , however , is controlled by @xmath123 rather than by @xmath143 .",
    "we note that the order - disorder transition with @xmath123 might also represent a _",
    "spin - glass transition_. such transitions are common for magnets , where spins represent magnetic moments . in magnets global ordering of spins can result in a ferromagnetic state , where all spins point along a common direction and a macroscopic magnetic field builds up .",
    "anti - ferromagnetic order results when spins are globally ordered but with equal numbers of up and down spins , such that no macroscopic polarization builds up .",
    "a spin - glass transition occurs when e.g.  due to disordered positions of spins no ferro- or anti - ferromagnetic order develops even at low temperatures . in analogy ,",
    "dipoles in our model represent spins .",
    "the aligned structure therefore might be called a _ ferroelastic phase _ , because a macroscopically anisotropic polarization stress develops spontaneously . in analogy",
    ", the ring - like structure might be called an _ antiferroelastic phase _ , because the macroscopic stress exerted by the dipoles remains isotropic . when @xmath144 , no global order develops even in the limit @xmath145 ; instead",
    ", many equally favorable states exist . because we do not allow dipoles to adjust positions",
    ", they can not relax into an ordered ferro- or anti - ferroelastic state .",
    "thus , the disordered low temperature phase might also represent a spin glass .",
    "there is an interesting difference between thermally disordered states and density disordered states at low t. in both cases , dipoles can be aligned by application of an external field .",
    "the former might be called a _ paraelastic phase _ because it relaxes into the unpolarized disordered state after the external field is switched off with a single time - scale @xmath146 .",
    "in contrast , the later might represent a spin - glass state and relaxation into the disordered state can not be described by a single power law .",
    "in fact a characteristic feature of spin glasses is a fast relaxation to a remanent polarization and then a slow relaxation into the unpolarized state , which may exceed experimental timescales .",
    "although cell behaviour in 3d is not the focus of this paper , we now spell out a few predictions resulting from our model in this case .",
    "calculations for cells positioned on a simple cubic lattice suggest that in incompressible environments ( @xmath147 ) the optimal structure is effectively isotropic with a hedgehog - like unit cell , where all dipoles at the corners point to the cube s center , see a , while for @xmath136 spontaneous symmetry breaking along a principal lattice lattice vector occurs , see b. this indicates that similar transitions between ring - like and string - like structures as a function of poisson ratio @xmath58 exist in 3d as they do in 2d .",
    "string - like structures might also be favored by anisotropies in the effective mechanical properties of the environment .",
    "for example , fiber alignment or external strain fields might cause cell alignment with the external perturbation , which could be further stabilized by elastic interactions between cells . in c",
    "we show a corresponding snapshot of a monte carlo simulation with @xmath148 cells modeled as hard spheres with an elastic dipole moment at their center .",
    "here we allowed for both orientational and positional degrees of freedom ( @xmath149 ) , where the position dependence of @xmath16 from is used for additional monte carlo moves .",
    "moreover we applied a homogeneous strain field along the @xmath150-direction .",
    "cells respond by an alignment with the external field and the formation of strings as has been observed experimentally @xcite . without external field but with mobile cells",
    "we typically observe formation of `` networks '' of cells at low temperature and intermediate densities and disconnected uncorrelated strings at elevated noise levels and low densities , respectively . in general",
    ", we expect that the low to intermediate density regime of a three 3d phase diagram for mobile elastically interacting force dipoles will resemble the phase behavior of electric dipolar fluids @xcite . in both systems string formation dominates and",
    "string - string interactions are screened in the same way @xcite . at high dipole",
    "densities our lattice calculations in 3d suggest that phase transitions as a function of poisson ratio may occur and we find evidence that again a low poisson ratio of the material tends to favor global cell alignment .",
    "in finite 3d environments the geometry and boundary condition of the sample may also affect structure formation .",
    "the presence of a boundary modifies the direct elastic interaction between cells by boundary induced strain fields , which , depending on boundary condition , introduce either attractive or repulsive contributions to the elastic interaction plus a direct interaction term with the boundary @xcite .",
    "an instructive example for the competition between the direct interaction of a cell with the boundary and cellular interactions is the elastic half space with a clamped boundary .",
    "when cells are located close to the boundary , the direct interaction with a clamped boundary favors cellular orientations pointing toward the surface @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , interactions between cells favor the formation of strings and thus parallel orientations .",
    "our calculations suggest that the transition between these two configurations is a function of the ratio @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the distance to the boundary and @xmath39 is the distance between cells , and the number of interacting cells @xmath26 . above a critical value @xmath153 the direct interaction with the boundary dominates and cells",
    "are expected to point toward the surface . for @xmath154 orientations in parallel to the clamped surface are favored when sufficiently many cells are present , @xmath155 . in d",
    "we plot @xmath156 as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , collective effects may alter preferred cell organization close to clamped boundaries .",
    "in contrast for a free surface the direct interaction with boundary favors parallel alignment , which is further stabilized by collective elastic effects between cells .",
    "this may explain the robust parallel alignment of cells with respect to free surfaces which has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "using a simple mathematical model and extensive monte carlo simulations , we have analyzed structure formation due to elastic effects for fibroblast - like cells with anisotropic force patterns .",
    "our model predicts in a quantitative way how structure formation is controlled on soft elastic substrates by the poisson ratio @xmath58 , the reduced cell density @xmath123 , the relative strength of elastic interactions with respect to noise ( represented by the reduced temperature @xmath52 ) and the geometry of cell positioning .",
    "up to intermediate cell densities , we predict the formation of uncorrelated strings of cells ( paraelastic phase ) .",
    "this finding can be explained by noting that the cellular traction patterns in strings screen each other , as we have demonstrated before by an analytical calculation @xcite .",
    "for high cell densities , we find an interesting competition between isotropic ring - like and anisotropic string - like structures .",
    "the string - like ( ferroelastic ) phase is reminiscent of the nematic phase for liquid crystals . in contrast",
    ", the nematic order parameter vanishes in the ring - like ( anti - ferroelastic ) phase , because local ordering principles preclude nematic order on the macroscopic scale .",
    "the poisson ratio @xmath58 allows to switch between these phases .",
    "it strongly affects cellular structure formation due to the non - trivial way in which stress and strain propagates in the elastic environment .",
    "the antiferroelastic phase is expected to occur on synthetic elastic substrates made from e.g.  polyacrylamide or polydimethylsiloxane , which are characterized by @xmath157 . in order to obtain the nematic phase , new kinds of polymer gels for cell culture are needed , with considerable lower values for the poisson ratio ( namely below @xmath158 ) .",
    "one possible route might be the design of biocompatible polymer gels with large meshsizes but little hydration , thus avoiding the incompressibility effect of bound water . as it is an open issue",
    "on which time and length scales cells sense the mechanical properties of their environment @xcite , design and testing of new materials is crucial for progress in this field .    like the poisson ratio , also",
    "the other determinants of cellular structure formation are in principle accessible experimentally .",
    "the young modulus @xmath24 directly affects the reduced temperature and can easily be varied in experiments .",
    "nevertheless it does not appear to be a reasonable control variable for experiments , mainly because the predicted structure formation might be expected to take place only in a small range of @xmath24-values , namely the ones corresponding to physiological rigidities ( around kpa ) .",
    "other control parameters of interest are cellular contractility ( which affects @xmath52 through the force dipole moment @xmath2 and which might be varied for example by administering lpa , which stimulates rho - mediated contractility ) and the average distance @xmath39 between cells (",
    "although , in order for the force dipole approximation to remain valid , the typical distance between cells should not be smaller than the typical cell length ) .",
    "the most important experimental control parameter next to the poisson ratio @xmath58 might be the geometry of cell positioning , which can be controlled with patterning techniques ( including microcontact printing in two dimensions ) .",
    "elastic effects are likely to contribute to large scale tissue organization and to the structure - function relationship of tissues .",
    "our results indicate that for sparsely populated tissues , elastic interactions , despite their long - ranged character , might have only a rather local effect .",
    "this is a result of the local tendency for cells to align into strings combined with the resulting screening of elastic fields . in this regime",
    "the system remains macroscopically disordered over a wide range of variations in material properties and cell density , effectively making the composite material of matrix and cells robust against perturbations .",
    "it is well known that the sparsely populated connective tissue is a rather disordered structure .",
    "our simulations suggest that without macroscopic external fields elastic interactions between cells favor isotropic disordered structures . in this case",
    "the average stress in the tissue resulting from cells is isotropic , that is @xmath159 , where @xmath143 is the cell density .",
    "the situation changes when an external field is applied ( e.g.  resulting from a wound ) .",
    "then highly aligned structures may prevail . in this",
    "case cells orient their mechanical activity in such a way that the average cellular stress in the medium @xmath160 becomes anisotropic in response to homogeneous uniaxial stress , that is , the cellular stress is directed opposite to the externally applied stress ( e.g. as to close the wound ) .",
    "it is an interesting question what happens after the external alignment field has decreased to zero .",
    "our calculations suggest that elastic interactions may stabilize an aligned structure even in the absence of external fields . in particular , disordered tissues ( like the connective tissue )",
    "may become aligned due to an external field . due to elastic interactions the transition from the aligned state back into the normal disordered state upon switching off the external field could be dramatically slowed down , in analogy to similar effects observed in magnetic spin glasses .",
    "this could have implications for wound healing and scar formation .",
    "polarization also occurs spontaneously in our model .",
    "interestingly , this state reminds of the disease state called _ contracture _ , when certain tissues ( like skin or muscle ) start to tighten up , eventually preventing movement of body parts .",
    "it is an interesting speculation whether the mechanical properties of extracellular matrices are altered by ( diseased ) cells in such a way as to effectively induce variations in the poisson ratio , which could trigger transitions between ferro- and anti - ferroelastic states . in order to investigate this point in more detail",
    ", our model should be extended to include viscoelastic and plastic effects as well as fiber degrees of freedom .",
    "mechanotaxis also plays an important role for _ dynamic _ rearrangement of groups of cells in tissues , including development , wound healing , capillary sprouting and tumor growth .",
    "the work presented here builds on experimental observations which suggest that cells migrate toward high strain areas and orient their mechanical activity in such a way as to pull back in response to external tensile strain .",
    "such tensile strain is certainly present e.g.  close to wounded areas or tumors .",
    "future studies will show in which sense our model can be adapted to these more specific situations .",
    "the current study shows in a general way that many interesting structure formation processes arise from mechanical effects in communities of mechanosensitive cells and therefore might help not only to understand the corresponding physiological situations , but also to program new tissue functions by guiding the design of novel material with appropriate mechanical properties .",
