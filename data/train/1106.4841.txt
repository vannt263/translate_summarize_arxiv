    "<S> in this work , we present a work in progress towards an efficient and economical computational module which interfaces between cauchy and characteristic evolution codes . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to provide a standardized waveform extraction tool for the numerical relativity community which will allow cce to be readily applied to a generic cauchy code . </S>",
    "<S> the tool provides a means of unambiguous comparison between the waveforms generated by evolution codes based upon different formulations of the einstein equations and different numerical approximation . </S>"
