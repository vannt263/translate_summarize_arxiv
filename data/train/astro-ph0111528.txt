    "the luminosity function ( lf hereafter ) , i.e. the number density of galaxies having a given luminosity , is critical to many observational and theoretical problems ( see e.g. binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ) . from an observational point of view , the lf is the natural  weight \" of all those quantities which need to be weighted against the relative number of objects in each luminosity bin .",
    "furthermore , due to the roles played by flux and surface brightness in the inclusion of objects in any observed sample ( faint objects or low surface brightness galaxies are often excluded or under  represented ) , the knowledge of the lf and the lf bi  variate in surface brightness is fundamental to compute the selection function and is needed to derive the actual galaxy properties from the measured quantities ( see , for example , the discussion on the field lf steepness by sprayberry et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the optical lf of galaxies in clusters has been extensively studied ( e.g. , to cite just a few papers dealing with large number of clusters , gaidos 1997 ; valotto et al .",
    "1997 ; lumsden et al . 1997 ; garilli , maccagni & andreon , 1999 )",
    ". however , faint dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies are outside the reach of most of the previous investigations .",
    "furthermore , the existence of compact galaxies is usually ignored , because , in practice , they are misclassified as stars and then removed from the sample ( see , as an exception drinkwater et al .",
    "therefore , an extension of the lf to fainter magnitudes and lower surface brightnesses , and without any assumption on the compact galaxy contribution , and possibly bi  variate in surface brightness would be profitable .",
    "most importantly , the _ global _ lf hides the true problem ( sandage 1994 ) : the lf is the sum of the lfs of the specific types , or of any other physically based galaxy classes .",
    "in fact , the lf is dependent on the environment as shown by binggeli , sandage & tammann ( 1988 ) .",
    "maybe the lfs of the morphological types are universal ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 , jerjen & tammann 1997 , andreon 1998 ) , but faint galaxies whose morphological type do not fit well in the hubble ( 1936 ) morphological scheme ( which has been built for classifying giant galaxies , not dwarfs ) raise some concern on the extension of the _ type  dependent _ lf at faint magnitudes .",
    "galaxies can be also classified on the basis of their central brightness which also determines where they fall in the fundamental plane ( e.g. bender , burstein & faber 1997 ) , showing that this classification reflects some physical difference between the classes . therefore , `` it would be of great importance to know what the luminosity function looks like when divided into classes of surface brightness '' ( kron 1994 ) .",
    "in contrast to hubble types , classes of central brightness are continuous ( as often nature is ) , quicker to determine , and can be computed with observations of lower quality than those required to determine morphological types .",
    "however , brightness classes merge in the same class giant galaxies of the different morphological types , which are known to have different properties ( see , e.g. andreon 1996 for coma galaxies ) .    in the present paper we present in three colors the lf and in two colors the lf bi  variate in surface brightness of a sample of galaxies in the coma cluster of about 1000 members .",
    "we measure them down to the magnitude of three bright globular clusters , and to the brightness of the faintest cataloged low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "our studied area is among the largest cluster area ever observed with ccds .",
    "we use the standard method for computing the lf , namely , the method of differential counts ( zwicky 1957 ) .",
    "the method is quite simple : the lf of the cluster galaxies is the difference between galaxy counts in the cluster direction and those counted in a control field direction devoid of ( cataloged ) clusters .",
    "this method has a some advantages : 1 ) it does not require an extensive redshift survey .",
    "2 ) the redshift dependence of the k correction is not needed .",
    "3 ) the number of galaxies in each magnitude bin is proportional to the natural frequency with which galaxies are found in the universe , at least in clusters .",
    "4 ) the difficult problem of calculating the visibility function for a mixed diameter+flux limited survey ( as all _ field _ survey actually are ) is completely skipped , because the cluster sample is naturally volume  limited ( details are presented in section 3 ) .",
    "the method has the main shortcoming that it applies only to galaxy over  densities , and that galaxies in clusters could not be representative of galaxies in general . in that case",
    ", the study of cluster galaxies could reveal a correlation between the cluster environment and galaxy properties .    for the coma cluster ,",
    "we adopt distance modulus of 35.1 mag ( i.e. @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc ) , according to the direct measure by baum et al .",
    "the slope of the lf is , as for the schechter ( 1976 ) function , defined by    @xmath8    in such as way that a flat ( in mag ) lf has @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 coma cluster observations were taken on january 12th , 1999 , during the cfh12k ( cuillandre et al .",

    "we do not find any trend for a zero  point dependency on magnitude , color , ccd considered , and apparent location in the field of view .",
    "photometric calibration has been cross checked by using aperture magnitudes of a few galaxies in our field of view listed in de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ) .",
    "this external check rules out zero  point errors larger than @xmath18 mag .",
    "the @xmath10 band control field is the area around the galaxy ngc3486 ( which occupies less than 10 % of the camera field of view , a @xmath19 arcmin@xmath14 area ) .",
    "this field shares the photometric calibration of coma and we have checked the photometric zero point , at a 0.1 mag error level , by comparing our aperture photometry of ngc3486 with that listed in de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ) . @xmath11 and @xmath12 control field images ( sa 57 ) have been taken from the archive of one of us ( j .- c .",
    "c. ) . they were taken in 1998 at the same telescope , through identical filters , but with the uh8k camera equipped with frontside illuminated ccds .",
    "uh8k is an 8k @xmath13 8k mosaic camera with a 28 @xmath13 28 arcmin@xmath14 field of view and a pixel size of 0.206 arcsec .",
    "this sa57 field is centered on a region devoid of ( cataloged ) clusters , and includes a photometric sequence ( majewski et al .",
    "1994 ) , which allows an accurate and straightforward photometric calibration .",
    "no significant color term has been detected ( as none is present in the cfh12k images ) .",
    "one of the ccds of the uh8k presented a severe charge transfer problem , and for simplicity it has entirely discarded from further analysis .",
    "these images cover a large area of @xmath20 arcmin@xmath14 and they are angularly distant enough from the coma cluster ( a bit more than 2 degree , corresponding to 3.4 mpc , or a 1.5 abell radii at the coma cluster distance ) not to be strongly contaminated by its galaxies , but near enough to sample the overdensity associated to the coma supercluster .",
    "however , our @xmath10 band control field samples a background several degrees away from the coma cluster direction .",
    "field images were processed following the same procedure applied to the coma cluster data .",
    "objects are detected using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , using standard settings ( a minimal area of four pixels and a threshold of @xmath21 of the sky ) .",
    "the cluster lf ( or , equivalently , the relative space density distribution of galaxies of each luminosity ) is computed as the difference between galaxy counts in the coma and in the control field directions ( for an introduction on the method , see , e.g. , oemler 1974 ) .",
    "the lf bi  variate in central brightness is computed in a similar way by subtracting off the contribution due to foreground and background measured in the control field from counts in the coma direction .",
    "the method is robust , provided that all sources of errors are taken in to account .",
    "several of them have already summarized in bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , trentham ( 1997 ) and driver et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and not repeated here .",
    "we remind that :     extensive simulations show that undetected galaxies can not be confidently recovered , even statistically , so that completeness corrections are unreliable ( trentham 1997 ) . therefore , it is preferable , as we did , to cut the sample at the magnitude of the brightest galaxy of the faintest detected surface brightness",
    ".     gravitational lensing distorts background counts in the cluster line of sight ( bernstein et al .",
    "1995 ; trentham 1997 ) but it is negligible in very nearby clusters , such as coma .    this is a quickly growing field , so one should be aware that terms that presently are currently included in the error budget , such as non ",
    "poissonian fluctuations , were not included just few years ago ( but there are exceptions , such as oemler 1976 ) .",
    "a few sources of concern that should be considered in computing the lf and bi  variate lf of galaxies are discussed in more detail in the next sections .      by using a control field that crosses the coma supercluster ( in @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , we are able to measure the coma cluster lf without the contamination of the large scale structure in which it is embedded , unlike almost all previous ccd determinations of the cluster lf that",
    "used control fields in areas too distant from the studied cluster ( e.g. bernstein et al .",
    "1995 ; trentham 1998a ; lobo et al . 1997 ; biviano et al .",
    "it is easy to show ( paolillo et al .",
    "2001 ) that a control field too close to the cluster , and therefore contaminated by cluster galaxies , does not alter the shape of the lf , but just changes the lf normalization ( and makes errorbars larger ) if the lf does not depend too much on environment .      the photometric quality of the night , our checks with aperture photometry of catalogues galaxies and the presence of photometric standard in the field of view , all exclude photometric errors as significant source of errors in the determination of the lf or the bi - variate lf .",
    "fluctuations of galaxy counts are surely no longer simply poissonian in nature ( i.e. due only to small number statistics ) , because of a non  zero correlation function , or , in simple words , because of the existence of clusters , groups and voids .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude can be directly measured , as in bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , or estimated by using the huang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) formalism , which uses the galaxy angular correlation function in order to estimate the galaxy count variance averaged over the field of view at a given magnitude and passband .",
    "we use this last method , owing just one control field .",
    "background fluctuations is , in most of the luminosity bins , the largest term in the error budget .",
    "huang et al . ( 1997 ) provide the amplitude of the background variance in a given magnitude bin and in a given area , once the characteristic ( @xmath22 ) luminosity of the field population is given , by adopting a galaxy  galaxy spatial correlation function . as characteristic luminosity",
    ", we adopt @xmath23 mag ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ; garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ; paolillo et al . 2001",
    "; blanton et al . 2001 ) . adopting characteristic luminosities that differ by up to one mag does not change appreciably the errors .",
    "errorbars for the bi ",
    "variate lf further assume ( because of the lack of appropriate measures ) that the correlation scale of the galaxy angular correlation function is the same for all galaxies , independently on their central brightness .",
    "thus , errorbars are approximate , but we verified that a difference in the clustering scale of a factor two produces negligible changes to our results .",
    "due to the fact that the lf is the difference between `` cluster+background '' and `` background '' , the error on the lf has two terms related to the background . in almost all literature lfs , only one term related to the background is taken into account , under the implicitly assumption that the `` true '' background counts are perfectly known",
    ".      visual inspection of our images shows that several faint objects in the coma direction are larger , when measured at @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath4 , than those in our control field , where most of the faint objects are small .",
    "the adopted detection thresholds ( @xmath25 mag arcsec@xmath4 in @xmath26 and @xmath12 , respectively ) are fainter than the typical central brightness of low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs , hereafter ) , which range from 22 to 24 @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath4 ( mcgaugh , schombert & bothun 1995 ; bothun , impey & mcgaugh 1997 ) . quite recently ( oneil et al . 1999 ) lsbgs of central brightness as faint as @xmath27 have been counted .",
    "therefore , our detection threshold is as low as , or just slightly brighter than , the lowest central brightness sampled so far , with the notable exception of ulmer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) lsbgs .",
    "the measured luminosity of lgbgs is strongly dependent on the integration radius because of their shallow surface brightness profiles .",
    "we adopt isophotal magnitudes , recognizing that these magnitudes include a fraction of the object luminosity depending on the object central brightness and on the radial surface brightness profile .",
    "our magnitudes are not , therefore , _ total _ magnitudes . in sect 5.1",
    "we discuss the impact of this choice on the lf .",
    "galaxy counts are strongly dependent on the type of magnitude ( aperture , isophotal , asymptotic , etc ) used for measuring the flux , and in the cluster direction this effect is exacerbated by nearby ( and therefore large ) galaxies .",
    "our field counts agree with those in literature ( driver et al .",
    "1994 ; trentham et al .",
    "1998 ) once we select the same type of magnitude adopted in the comparison work .",
    "we found that galaxy counts are significantly lower when the adopted isophotal magnitudes are used .",
    "we notice that galaxies with normal colors are easier to detect in @xmath11 and @xmath12 than in @xmath10 , because of the much brighter detection threshold in the latter filter .",
    "since undetected lsbgs can not be recovered , we need to cut the sample at the magnitude of the brightest lsbgs of the faintest detectable central surface brightness .",
    "a detailed explanation of this method is described in garilli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . by definition ,",
    "the sample will be complete down to the cutting magnitude . for our sample ,",
    "the cutting magnitudes are : @xmath28 and @xmath29 mag . at these magnitudes the measured signal to noise ratio is about 20 .      due to the low surface brightness threshold , lsbgs are included in our catalogue",
    ". galaxies with extremely low central surface brightness ( @xmath30 mag arcec@xmath4 ) are correctly excluded in our lfs because their magnitude at the chosen isophote is exactly zero .",
    "catalogues suffer a usual incompleteness : due to the noise , galaxies can be undetected even if their central brightness is slightly brighter than the threshold , and can be detected even if their brightness is below the threshold .",
    "furthermore , the noise and the increasing galaxy counts at faint magnitudes include in catalogues a larger number of galaxies than they exclude ( this effect is called eddington bias ) . by keeping only high quality data , as we do by cutting the samples at the completeness magnitude , incompleteness and eddington bias are a minor concern .",
    "for example in our fainter bin , the observed minimal signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) is @xmath31 in @xmath12 , while at the faintest magnitude and at the faintest surface brightness , the observed s / n of the central brightness is @xmath32 in @xmath12 .",
    "the control field images are deeper than coma images , and taken under better seeing conditions , with the exception of the @xmath10 images that were taken during similar seeing conditions ( see table 1 ) . in order to compute the lf and the bi ",
    "variate lf , it is necessary to match the properties of the control and program images .",
    "first of all , we match the seeing profile , convolving control field images with an appropriate kernel .",
    "the match of point spread function is checked by verifying that stars lay on the same magnitude @xmath33 central brightness locus , in both the coma and the control field images .",
    "then , the noise in the images is matched by adding poissonian noise .",
    "we checked that the noise matching is not crucial , i.e. the results do not change by more than the errorbars .",
    "this holds because we take the general approach of completely discarding all data which are affected by noise . by cutting our sample to a minimal signal to noise of 20 ,",
    "noise is not a concern .",
    "careful numerical simulations performed by us show that existing elliptical galaxies as compact as ngc4486b or m32 , could not be recognized as galaxies in our images _ independently of their luminosity _ if they were in the coma cluster , and they look like stars on our images .",
    "as previously stated , the lf is given by the difference of _ galaxy _ counts .",
    "what is actually usually taken in literature is the difference of counts of _ extended _ objects .",
    "the two calculations give the same result when galaxies and `` extended objects '' classes perfectly overlap , however this hypothesis is not satisfied even in a cluster as near as the coma one .",
    "excluding _ ab initio _ compact galaxies from the class of galaxies , they could not be counted in the lf .",
    "how to solve this problem ? in two ways , depending on the object luminosity :    \\a ) bright objects .",
    "our control field is close enough in the sky to the coma cluster to assume that star counts are equal , within the statistical fluctuations , in the two pointings ( which are both at the galactic pole and whose nearest corners are less than 1 degree apart ) .",
    "we verified by means of besanon models ( http://www.obs-besancon.fr/www/modele/modele.html ) that the variation of star counts due to the small differences in galactic latitude and longitude between coma and the control field is negligible ( far less than 1% ) .",
    "we can check the existence of bright compact galaxies ( misclassified as stars ) by simply comparing the number of the star  like objects in the coma and control field directions . in the control field",
    "there are 236 objects brighter than @xmath34 mag classified as stars .",
    "the expected number of stars in the coma pointing ( which covers a larger area ) is thus 384 .",
    "we found 382 stars , two less than the expected number , and therefore no excess of compact objects in the coma direction is found .",
    "the @xmath35 upper limit to the number of compact ellipticals in the studied portion of coma is 25 . even if these 25 galaxies were present ( while we found @xmath36 galaxies ) , they are a minor population ( a 9 % of the net number of coma galaxies brighter than @xmath34 mag ) and they change the measured coma cluster fl by less than errorbars . due to the verified paucity of compact galaxies in coma ,",
    "bright stars ( brighter than @xmath34 mag ) are individually removed from galaxy counts . unlike previous works",
    ", we have verified that compact galaxies are a minority population before discarding them .",
    "\\b ) faint objects . at faint magnitudes ,",
    "even not so compact galaxies can be misclassified as stars due to noise in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , we found that several objects from the control field are misclassified at @xmath37 mag , when the images are degraded to match the seeing and noise of coma ones .",
    "furthermore , star counts differ in the coma and field directions at faint magnitudes ( but not at bright magnitudes ) , whereas they should be equal according to the model .",
    "therefore , stars are not individually identified and removed , but statistically subtracted and star  like objects in the coma direction due to compact galaxies are not thrown away during the star / galaxy classification . as a consequence ,",
    "the problem of the star / galaxy misclassification ( both due to object faintness and to the intrinsically object compactness ) is overcome . this way , the problem represented by compact objects is solved , but at the price of larger errorbars because of the statistical subtraction .",
    "we stress out that _ measured _ stars counts are used , not the expected ones .",
    "even a casual inspection of the region around ic4051 , an early type galaxy in the studied field shown in the bottom panel of figure 1 , shows a huge population of extended sources clustered around this galaxy .",
    "other extended sources are present near ngc4481 , another bright coma elliptical in our field of view .",
    "these objects are extended and as bright as @xmath38 mag . since globular clusters ( gcs hereafter ) of ic4051 have a turnoff magnitude of @xmath39 ( baum et al .",
    "1997 ) , and are unresolved at the coma distance ( i.e. they are point sources ) , these huge population can not be formed by individual gcs . in order to understand how many extended source there are at each magnitude , we compute their luminosity function .",
    "we first subtract a model of the galaxy , obtained by fitting its isophotes .",
    "then , we compute the counts in an annulus centered on ic4051 of 6 and 31 arcsec of inner and outer radii respectively , and in a control region of the same area at 160 arcsec east of ic4151 . in the annulus on ic4051 we found an excess of @xmath40 too many extended objects per mag per square degree at @xmath41 , with respect to the control field .",
    "the number of extended objects in the annulus is four times larger than in the control field , and the excess is statistically significant , even including non  poissonian fluctuations .",
    "the luminosity function of these extended sources have a slope , in a 3 mag magnitude range fainter than @xmath38 mag , compatible with the slope of the gcs specific frequency ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the brightest of these extended sources has @xmath38 mag , i.e. they are @xmath43 mag brighter that the gc turnoff ( directly measured by baum et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for this galaxy ) , and 3.4 mag brighter than the tip of the gc population ( which in turn is ill defined , because the number of bright gcs decrease exponentially at bright magnitude without any clear break ) .    since ic4051 has been observed by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( baum et al . 1997 ) we can use the superior angular resolution of the _ hst _ for better understanding these sources .",
    "_ hst _ archive images of ic4051 have been retrieved , the galaxy has been modeled and subtracted off , as for the ground images .",
    "figure 2 shows the residual image of ic4051 , as seen in our ground image ( left panel ) and from the space ( right panel ) . in the left panel ,",
    "the actual galaxies revealed by _",
    "hst _ are marked by circles .",
    "notice that only one faint object is circled .",
    "all the other objects are blends of a few point sources ( typically three to five ) , unblended at the _ hst _ resolution .",
    "most of them are brighter than our ( and other deep probing of the lf ) completeness limit , and therefore would be counted as galaxies in the lf .",
    "the two brightest blends in the _ hst _ field of view have @xmath44 and @xmath45 mag . the large majority of _ hst _ point sources are gcs ( baum et al .",
    "1997 ) , and therefore the large majority of our extended sources are blends of gcs",
    ". however , a few extended sources could be blends of any type of point sources , such as foreground stars , gcs and groups of gcs if they exist , because even _ hst _ can not individually distinguish gcs , at the coma distance , from foreground stars .",
    "in particular , the two brightest sources marked with a diamond in the _ hst _ image are largely dominated by a bright single point source , quite bright to be a single gc , whose identification as gc or foreground star is possible only on statistical basis .",
    "simple statistical arguments on the luminosity function of gcs suggest that the very brightest of our blends are blends of gcs and any other source unresolved at the _ hst _ resolution ( including groups of gcs if they exist ) , while the other ones are instead , in large majority , blends of gcs alone .",
    "inspection of the _ hst _ image of another large galaxy in our field , ngc4481 ( baum et al . 1995 ) , confirms our findings for such blends .    to summarize , our large population of extended sources are , in large majority , blends of gcs .",
    "while gcs are point sources , their blends are a source of concern because they have the unfortunate property of being classified as single extended sources in typical seeing conditions , and thus are included in the galaxy counts .",
    "being blends of a few / several gcs , these sources are brighter , on average , than gcs .",
    "therefore , gc blends do not only affect gc typical magnitudes ( @xmath46 mag ) , but also bias much brighter counts ( as bright as @xmath47 mag ) and are thus pernicious because they are extended sources .",
    "their density is high near giant ellipticals , four times higher than galaxy counts in the considered region of ic4051 .",
    "previous works studying the deepest part of the galaxy lf may be affected by gc blends at faint magnitudes .",
    "for example , the bernstein et al.s ( 1995 ) determination of the coma lf at very faint magnitudes , measured in the ngc4874 outer halo , optimistically assumes that the gcs contamination starts at @xmath48 mag ( while it starts at 2 magnitudes brighter ) and rule out a gc contamination at brighter magnitudes because their objects are marginally resolved , while we found that also gc blends share this property",
    ". de propris et al . (",
    "1995 ) found a steep lf over their very small studied field ( with a slope that nicely corresponds to those of our gg blends ) , and they correctly warn the reader on the possible contamination of their galaxy counts by an unusual population of gcs .",
    "actually , we believe that their counts are contaminated by gc blends more than an unusual population of gcs , because of the similarity of the properties of their possible unusual population of gcs to our gc blends and because trentham ( 1998 ) does not find such a steep slope when observing one the de propris et al .",
    "( 1995 ) clusters over a larger field of view ( where the contribution of gc blends is washed out ) .",
    "thus , the points of published lfs at @xmath49 mag should be regarded with caution as long as the area surveyed is comparable ( or smaller ) than that occupied by bright galaxies . because of this potential source of error , we generously mask out areas to discard a few bright galaxies with a large gc population and a halo .",
    "residual unflagged contamination is diluted by the very large field of view of our images .",
    "flagging areas occupied by large galaxies also solves in the simplest way the problem of crowding , because the unflagged area is mostly un  crowded .",
    "with respect to previous lf determinations , our work presents new features :     the control field , although only a single one , is at an ideal angular distance from the cluster pointing : far enough from the coma cluster not to be strongly contaminated by its galaxies , but near enough for correctly sampling the density enhancement of the great wall ( in which the coma cluster is embedded ) .",
    "even if the control field were contaminated by coma cluster galaxies , the shape of the lf would not be altered by this contamination .",
    "background fluctuations are included in the error budged .",
    " compact galaxies are not lost in the star / galaxy classification , and no assumption about their existence , or contribution to the lf , is made .",
    " we do not assume that galaxy counts in the control field are the `` true '' average errorless background , and in measuring errorbars , we count twice background errors",
    ".     blends of gcs are not counted in galaxy counts .",
    "figure 3 shows ( filled points ) the coma cluster lf down to @xmath50 and @xmath29 mag .",
    "notice the large number of galaxies per magnitude bin in our @xmath12 and @xmath11 lfs and the absolute faintness of studied galaxies ( @xmath51 , and @xmath52 mag ) , whose luminosity exceeds the tip of the gc lf ( @xmath53 mag ) by less than a factor 3 in flux ( in the deepest bands ) .",
    "the lf extends over an 11 magnitude range and it is one of the deepest ever derived from ccd photometry .",
    "the lfs in the three filters present both similarities and differences .",
    "the lfs seem truncated at the bright end ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 mag ) .",
    "this abrupt truncation is due to the fact that all galaxies brighter than the first plotted point are removed from the sample because their potential large population of gcs ( and their blends ) .    at intermediate luminosities ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 mag ) the lfs are fairly flat .",
    "at fainter magnitudes , the lfs are steep in @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and with a much shallower slope in @xmath10 .",
    "of course , the exact slope depends on the considered magnitude and filter and can be precisely computed by the reader at his favorite magnitude by taking the best fit functions whose parameters are listed in table 2 or by using the tabulated lf included as electronic table .",
    "the typical slopes range from @xmath59 in @xmath10 to @xmath60 in @xmath12 and @xmath11 . in the three filters we do not see any clear",
    "turn off of the lf , meaning that galaxies can be as faint as 3 very bright gcs and such galaxies are the most numerous in the studied coma region . in the @xmath11 band",
    "there is a hint of a flattening of the lf at faint magnitudes , but the statistical evidence for it , or for a turn off of the lf , is small due to the large errors .    the quality of our lfs decreases going toward blue filters for two reasons : first of all , the surveyed area in @xmath10 is 30 % smaller than in @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "second , bluer filters select preferentially blue galaxies , abundant in the field and rare in clusters and therefore the contrast between members and interlopers is low . because of these reasons , the bi  variate lf in the @xmath10 band is not presented .    in the @xmath12 band , the lf shape is not well described by schechter ( 1976 ) law , because their best fit has @xmath61 for 18 degrees of freedom .",
    "a function with more free parameters better describes the data .",
    "the best fit with a 3@xmath62 order power ",
    "law ( i.e. with one more free parameter ) is overplotted in figure 3 ( smooth curves ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "the reduced @xmath63 is @xmath64 , suggesting a good fit .",
    "the lf does not continue to steepen any more at longer wave bands , because in the @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) band , the lf of the same portion of the cluster has slope @xmath67 down to @xmath68 mag ( andreon & pell 2000 ) , which roughly correspond to @xmath69 mag or @xmath70 mag .    at @xmath71 mag",
    "there is an hint of a possible dip in the lf : @xmath72 coma galaxies are expected in the half magnitude bin , while @xmath73 is observed .",
    "however , the statistical significance of the effect is negligible ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this feature is common among the so far determined coma lfs : it has been found in the photographic @xmath11 ( goodwin & peach 1997 ) and @xmath75 band ( biviano et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in the near  infrared @xmath65 band ( andreon & pell 2000 ) .      the shaded regions in figure 3 delimit the best previous determinations of the lf . in the @xmath12 band ,",
    "the shaded region is the lf of the  deepest and most detailed survey covering [ _ omissis _ ] a large area \" ( trentham 1998 ) .",
    "he surveyed a @xmath76 deg@xmath14 area of the coma cluster , i.e. a 40 % smaller area than the present survey , overlapping but not coincident with the coma cluster region studied in this paper . at @xmath77 mag , ( @xmath78 mag ) the _ literature _ lf is quite noisy and does not constrain the lf .",
    "the bright part of the trentham @xmath12 lf disagrees with those computed from surveys of large number of clusters ( e.g. paolillo et al . 2001 , piranomonte et al .",
    "2001 ) , while our lfs are truncated because we removed giant galaxies and their surrounding area where the gc blends contamination is potentially high .",
    "the two lfs are normalized to @xmath79 and show reasonable agreement , given the errors , in the region of validity of both lfs .",
    "we notice that errorbars in trentham ( 1998 ) are , in our opinion , underestimated because they count only once background fluctuations , instead of two as we advocate .",
    "the much shallower @xmath12 band lf of the coma cluster computed by secker & harris ( 1996 ) shows a similar agreement .    in the @xmath11 band , no lf , comparable in depth and extension to the present one ,",
    "is known to the authors .    in the @xmath10 band ,",
    "trentham ( 1998b ) summarizes our present knowledge on the lf by computing the composite cluster lf , averaging over almost all literature lfs based on wide field deep images , including virgo ( sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 ) , for example .",
    "the shaded region in the bottom panel shows his result , once data are sampled at 1 mag bins ( which help in reducing the scatter ) and vertically shifted to match our points at @xmath80 mag .",
    "our data agree well with the trentham ( 1998b ) composite lfs and the agreement should increase if trentham s ( 1998b ) errorbars were made larger in order to include twice the background fluctuations in the error budget .    to summarize",
    ", we compute the coma lf in three bands , over a very large magnitude range ( up to 11 mag ) with good statistics .",
    "our results agree with previous lf determinations on the common magnitude range .",
    "the discussion of the lf is deferred after the presentation of the bi ",
    "variate lf .",
    "the quality of our lf determination allows a truly new interesting quantity to be accurately determined : the bi ",
    "variate lf , i.e. the lf of galaxies of a given central brightness .",
    "central brightness is measured on the images ( which are convolved by the seeing disk , whose fwhm correspond to @xmath81 kpc to the coma cluster distance ) in a 0.25 kpc aperture . at the time of the submission of this paper , this determination was the first so far accurately computed for any environment , to our best knowledge .",
    "the previous larger effort in this direction is presented in de jong ( 1996 ) , with a study of a sample of 86 field galaxies ( while our sample includes @xmath82 cluster member galaxies ) , whose bi  variate lf is  more of qualitative than quantitative interest \" ( de jong 1996 ) . after this paper",
    "was submitted , two more bivariate lfs ( cross et al .",
    "2001 , blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) were submitted for the publication .",
    "figure 4 shows a 3d view of the @xmath12 bi  variate lf .",
    "2d views , at fixed surface brightnesses , are presented in figure 5 for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters . on the latter figures",
    "errorbars can be plotted , and therefore the quality of the bi ",
    "variate lf can be appreciated .",
    "brightness bins are 1 mag arcsec@xmath4 wide , except the brightest one , which is wider to improve the statistic . reducing the amplitude of the first brightness bin decreases slightly the statistics but does not change significantly the results .",
    "the way brightness is measured limits the luminosity range accessible to a galaxy of a given brightness : since the central brightness is measured on a finite area , objects of a given central brightness have a minimal flux .",
    "the hashed regions in figure 5 mark the regions that could not be occupied by our objects because of such a minimal flux .",
    "furthermore , no object of a given central brightness could be fainter than a star of the same central brightness .",
    "an arrow in the plots marks this magnitude . in this diagram , compact galaxies fall below the arrow .",
    "therefore , the observational available range for each bi  variate lf goes from @xmath83 to the arrow , including these limits .",
    "therefore , in figure 4 the region on the right not occupied by galaxies is empty because the rarity of such type of galaxies , whereas the empty region on the left is devoid of galaxies because of the way surface brightness is measured .    at all brightness bins , galaxies occupy a bounded range in luminosity , and smaller than the whole available range .",
    "although a distribution with a finite width is expected , we can now quantify it .",
    "the plotted values shown in figure 4 and 5 are tabulated in the joined electronic table .",
    "galaxies of very large size or very flat surface brightness profile ( i.e. near the left end of each bi  variate lf plot ) are uncommon . in fact , galaxies with @xmath84 , i.e. more than 4 mag brighter than their central brightness , are almost absent in our sample .",
    "furthermore , the bright end moves toward fainter magnitudes when the central brightness decreases .    at the faint end , the lfs seem to flatten or turns down .",
    "furthermore , the point at the arrow magnitude , i.e. objects that are as compact as the seeing disk , is seldom on the extrapolation of points at brighter magnitudes . while the possible flattening at magnitude slightly brighter than the arrows magnitude is uncertain , the points below the arrow are systematically lower than brighter points .",
    "the rarity of galaxies at the magnitude marked by the arrow , when compared to the expected value based on the trend at brighter magnitudes , is not due to the fact that compact galaxies are removed in the star / galaxy classification or implicitly supposed not to exist , because our derivation of the lf does not follow this path , unlike previous works .",
    "the found rarity of compact galaxies means that most of the galaxies at the coma distance are extended sources at our resolution and explains why our lf , which counts also compact galaxies , agrees with previous works that instead implicitly assume that compact galaxies do not exist .    lacking a _ field _",
    "variate lf it is difficult to say whether the coma cluster is effective in harassing lsb galaxies , as advocated by moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1999 ) , or the bi ",
    "variate lf is the same in the two environments and it tells us more on galaxy formation and evolution in general .",
    "figure 6 presents the @xmath12 band lf ( the curve ) , and a linear fit to the lf of the galaxies of each central brightness ( the lines ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table 2 . during the fit process , we manually discarded outliers points , and we arbitrary adopted a linear ( in log units ) fitting function .",
    "for some lfs a higher order function would be preferable but at the price of overfitting most of the other lfs .",
    "it is quite apparent that lsbgs galaxies dominate the lf at faint magnitudes , while high surface brightness galaxies dominate the bright end .",
    "high surface brightness galaxies ( @xmath85 mag arcsec@xmath4 ) have a shallow lf ( @xmath86 ) , while lsbgs galaxies have a steep and fainter lf ( see also fig 5 ) .",
    "there is a clear trend for a faintening of the lf going from high surface brightness galaxies to faint and very faint central brightnesses , also visible directly on the data in figure 5 .",
    "there is also some evidence for a steepening of the lf , in particular when galaxies of high surface brightness are considered .",
    "the trend is still there even when not considering at all the lf of galaxies with @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) mag arcsec@xmath4 , which is determined on a wider brightness range than the other bi  variate lfs , or adopting for this bin a 1 mag arcsec@xmath4 wide bin as we did for the other brightness bins .",
    "surface brightness is correlated to luminosity , since galaxies of lower central surface brightness have often fainter magnitudes ( figures 4 ) , as typically found in incomplete volume samples ( e.g. van der hulst , et al .",
    "1993 ; de blok , van der hulst & bothun 1995 ; impey & bothun 1997 , van den hoek et al .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that adopting a total magnitude instead of an isophotal magnitude should probably modify slightly the lf and the bi  variate lf by shifting them to the left and making them steeper . the lf becomes slightly brighter , i.e. moves to the left , because a fraction of the total flux is below the brightness threshold , thus the adopted isophotal magnitudes underestimate the total flux of the galaxies . for galaxies of high central brightness ( i.e. bright ,",
    "see section 4.3 ) the fraction of lost flux is fairly small ( trentham 1997 ) if their surface brightness profile below the observed brightness threshold follows the extrapolation of the observed part : the galaxy flux has been already integrated over a wide brightness range and the flux below the threshold is negligible . on the other end , the fraction of the total flux below the brightness threshold increases going toward faint magnitudes objects because these objects often have faint central brightnesses ( sect .",
    "4.3 ) and thus their isophotal magnitude is integrated on smaller and smaller brightness ranges . assuming that galaxies have perfect exponential surface brightness profiles , we find that the corrections range from @xmath89 mag for the galaxies of lowest surface brightness to @xmath90 mag for high surface brightness galaxies . because of this correction , the @xmath12 band lf changes its slope @xmath91 by @xmath90 , i.e. by 3 % .",
    "the lf likely becomes steeper when adopting total magnitudes for yet another reason : galaxies whose central brightness is below the present brightness threshold will be counted and they are likely preferably faint , if the trend presented in figure 5 continues at lower surface brightnesses and magnitudes .",
    "we found a large quantity of lsbgs in the core of the coma cluster .",
    "the cluster environment is often regarded as hostile to the formation and survival of lsbgs , in fact as much as 90 % of the stars in lsbgs can be harassed from them ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other end",
    ", the harassment process may contribute to the production of lsbgs in clusters ( moore , 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the harassment paradigm has no predictive power on the number of lsbgs in clusters .",
    "maybe the cluster lf might tell us about cluster ",
    "related processes in a too detailed level for a prediction with the present day models .",
    "phillipps et al .",
    "( 1998a ) examine the dissimilarity of the dwarf population in different environments .",
    "their faintest dwarfs are 5 mag brighter than our limit , i.e. they are talking about normal dwarfs , not faint ones .",
    "they note a variation in the lf shape which is driven in part by galaxy density : at low galaxy densities both steep and shallow lfs are permitted , while at high galaxy density only flat lfs are observed .",
    "we computed , according to their recipes , the giant  to  dwarf ratio ( which in our case used only galaxies with s / n@xmath92 ) and found a giant to dwarf ratio of @xmath93 , at the projected galaxy density of 26 gal mpc@xmath4 .",
    "the result is near the extrapolation of the outer envelope of their proposed correlation .",
    "this calculation is computed using @xmath94 km s@xmath7 mpc for consistency with phillips et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "there is ample discussion in the literature whether or not the local field lf is well determined at faint magnitudes , because most of the surveys purport to be magnitude limited do not take into account surface brightness effects ( disney 1997 ; sprayberry et al .",
    "1997 ; phillipps et al .",
    "optical surveys reveal an excess of faint blue galaxies over and above the number predicted by simple models relating local to distant observations ( e.g. tyson 1988 ; lilly et al .",
    "the flat faint  end slope measured in the local @xmath10band lf of galaxies ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) plays an important role in this interpretation , for the faint blues galaxies might otherwise be explained by a local population of intrinsically faint ( and nearby ) galaxies ( driver & phillipps 1996 ) .",
    "recent surveys , such as the cluster survey by impey , bothun & malin ( 1988 ) and irwin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and the field survey by impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have taken into account this potential source of bias by deliberately searching for lsbgs .",
    "however , their search is limited to giant lsbgs , i.e. dwarfs lsbgs are not sampled at all .",
    "some of these works also use galaxies whose size or surface brightness is near the survey limits and are obliged to statistically correct their sample for missed galaxies by adopting simplifying assumptions , for example that lsbgs have perfect exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "the same assumption is done again in computing the volume correction ( for field surveys ) .",
    "our own sample is a bit different from previous surveys : first of all , it is a volume  limited sample , since it is a cluster sample . unlike previous cluster surveys",
    ", we do not impose a large minimal size ( say 30 arcsec as impey , bothun & malin 1988 for virgo candidate galaxies ) , but we select the sample by absolute magnitude .",
    "therefore , _ dwarf _ lsbgs are not discarded _",
    "ab initio _ by adopting a large angular diameter for galaxies , provided that their flux brighter than the isophotal threshold is larger than the magnitude of completeness . furthermore , previous lsbgs searches compute the lsbg contribution to the lf _ assuming _ that all detected lsbgs belong to the studied cluster , while we compute the background and foreground contribution by using a control field . with respect to field lsbgs searches ,",
    "the advantages of the present determination are even larger : first of all , our sample is , as explained , a magnitude complete sample , while field sample are often diameter selected , at a large angular diameter ( for example , the survey of oneil , bothun & cornell ( 1996 ) that have a similar depth uses a 143 arcsec@xmath14 minimal size , but at a 2 - 3 mag deeper isophote ) .",
    "second , we choose to work only with the high s / n part of the catalog , thus completely skipping the problem of the correction for missed detections near the survey limits ( minimal size and minimal brightness ) .",
    "most importantly , the sample is volume  complete , and no volume correction / selection function should be computed since the visibility of coma galaxies does not depend on the redshift .",
    "it is true that beside coma lsbgs there are other lsbgs in the coma line of sight , but these are removed statistically from the sample .",
    "we remind the reader that the calculation of the volume correction / selection function for a diameter+brightness selected ( field ) sample is so difficult that many experienced astronomers , including disney ( 1976 ) , got it wrong when computing it ( disney 1999 ) .",
    "this correction is quite large and thus uncertain .",
    "for example , the median incompleteness correction applied in the calculation of the lf of lsbgs by sprayberry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , is five , which means that the one detected object has been used to infer the presence of four other galaxies escaping detection or redshift determination with similar photometric parameters and in the same universe volume .",
    "sprayberry et al . (",
    "1997 ) find a steep lf for lsbgs , steeper than the lf usually found in samples claimed to be flux ",
    "their lf is computed in the @xmath10 band and concerns galaxies with @xmath95 mag arcsec@xmath4 . assuming that field lsbgs have an average @xmath96 mag ( e.g. de blok et al .",
    "1995 ) we can compute the @xmath11 band field lf for galaxies with @xmath97 mag arcsec@xmath4 from the @xmath10 lf .",
    "the latter cut in surface brightness is applied to the coma galaxies in order to compare the two lfs .",
    "figure 7 compares the result of this exercise .",
    "there is a remarkable agreement on the location and slope of the exponentially decrease of the two lfs .",
    "instead , the two lf are arbitrary shifted .",
    "the minor difference at @xmath98 mag concerns 3.7 galaxies missed in the present lf , that can be fully accounted for by statistical fluctuations and by the difference in the passband used for selection .",
    "if the lsbgs lf is independent of the environment , this agreement confirms the correctness of the sprayberry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) calculation of the visibility function ( actually his survey has a selection function even more complex than those of diameter+brightness limited surveys ) and gives support to their claim that local field surveys overlook a numerous population of lsbgs .",
    "wide field images of a nearby cluster , coupled with a exhaustive analysis of the sources of error , allow us to extend the lf to very faint magnitudes and to include the lsbgs contribution .",
    "most importantly , the data allow the determination of the bi  variate lf , without missing lsbgs ( down to a faint limiting central brightness ) or losing compact galaxies , because of their resemblance to stars or to background galaxies . the present bi ",
    "variate lf determination has a straightforward selection function allowing a precise measure of the frequency defining how galaxies occupy the available space in the central surface brightness @xmath33 magnitude plane in the coma cluster .",
    "furthermore , the present determination does not need uncertain corrections for passing from the observed distribution to the actual galaxy distribution , simply because the sample is naturally volume  limited , or uncertain assumption on the membership of faint galaxies , because foreground and background has been statistically removed .",
    "lsbgs are by far the largest galaxy population , most of them are also quite faint and this study suggests that we have not yet reach the magnitude or the central brightness turn off ( if it exists ) . on the other hand , compact galaxies are a minority population .",
    "this work has been completed thanks to the efforts of many peoples involved in several projects : the cfh12k team provided a camera that worked smoothly right from the night of its first light , bill joye from sao provided ds9 , an efficient viewer for these large field images , emmanuel bertin provided sextractor , an efficient detection and classification software optimized for large images . the authors wish to thank the cfht director p. couturier for the allocation of cfh12k discretionary time , m. crz and a. robin for providing their 1998 raw uh8k data of the sa57 field and g. fahlman for his attentive lecture of this paper .",
