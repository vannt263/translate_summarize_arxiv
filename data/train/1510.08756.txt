    "it is challenging to image thick samples with a standard microscope .",
    "high - resolution objective lenses offer a shallow depth - of - field , which require one to axially scan through the sample to visualize three - dimensional shape .",
    "unfortunately , refocusing does not remove light from areas above and below the plane of interest .",
    "this longstanding problem has inspired a number of solutions , the most widespread being confocal designs , two - photon excitation methods , light sheet microscopy , and optical coherence tomography .",
    "these methods  gate out \" light from sample areas away from the point of interest , and offer excellent signal enhancement , especially for thick , fluorescent samples  @xcite .",
    "such gating techniques also encounter several problems .",
    "first , they typically must scan out each image , which might require physical movement and can be time consuming .",
    "second , the available signal ( i.e. , the number of ballistic photons ) decreases exponentially with depth . to overcome this limit",
    ", one must use a high na lens , which provides a proportionally smaller image field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "finally , little light is backscattered when imaging non - fluorescent samples that are primarily transparent , such as commonly seen in embryology , in model organisms such as zebrafish , and after the application of recent tissue - clearing  @xcite and expansion  @xcite techniques .    instead of capturing just the ballistic photons emerging from the sample",
    ", one might instead image the entire optical field , including the scattered components .",
    "this avoids point scanning , and allows one to record a very wide image fov in a single snapshot .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to enable depth selectivity after full - field capture .",
    "first , one might perform optical sectioning by capturing a focal stack , and then attempting digital deconvolution  @xcite .",
    "a second related example is light - field imaging  @xcite .",
    "point - spread function engineering is a third possibility  @xcite , but this typically requires a sparse sample .",
    "all three of these methods primarily operate with incoherent light , e.g. from fluorescent samples .",
    "they are thus not ideal tools for obtaining the complex refractive index distribution of a primarily transparent medium .    to do so , it is useful to use coherent illumination .",
    "for example , the amplitude and phase of a digital hologram may be computationally propagated to different depths within a thick sample , much like refocusing a microscope",
    ". however , the field at out - of - focus planes still influences the final result .",
    "several techniques have improved upon depth selectivity with quasi - coherent illumination , based upon the acquisition of multiple images  @xcite .",
    "a very useful framework to summarize how coherent light scatters through thick samples is diffraction tomography ( dt )  @xcite .",
    "this framework connects the optical fields that diffract from a sample , under arbitrary illumination , to its 3d complex refractive index . in a typical dt experiment ,",
    "one illuminates a sample of interest with a series of tilted plane waves and measures the resulting complex diffraction patterns in the far field .",
    "these measurements may then be combined with a suitable algorithm into a tomographic reconstruction . as a synthetic aperture technique",
    ", dt comes with the additional benefit of improving the limited resolution of an imaging element beyond its traditional diffraction - limit cutoff  @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears like a well - suited method to study thick , transparent samples at high resolution .    however , as a technique that models both the amplitude and phase of a coherent field , nearly all prior implementations of dt required a reference beam and holographic measurement , or some sort of phase - stable interference ( including slm coding strategies , e.g. as in @xcite ) .",
    "reference fields require sub - micrometer stability in terms of both motion and phase drift , which has thus far limited dt to well - controlled , customized setups .",
    "while several prior works have considered solving the dt problem from intensity - only measurements from a theoretical perspective  @xcite , none have implemented a dt system within a standard microscope , or connected their reconstruction attempts to ptychography .    here ,",
    "we perform dt based upon intensity images captured under variable led illumination from an array source .",
    "our technique , termed fourier ptychographic tomography ( fpt ) , captures a sequence of images while changing the light pattern displayed on the led array .",
    "then , it combines these images using a phase retrieval - based ptychographic reconstruction algorithm , which computationally ( as opposed to physically ) rejects light from all areas above and below each plane of interest .",
    "fpt also improves the lateral image resolution beyond the standard cutoff of the objective lens used for imaging .",
    "the end result is a quantitatively accurate three - dimensional map of the complex index of refraction of a volumetric sample , obtained directly from a sequence of standard microscope images .",
    "the theoretical foundations of dt were first developed by wolf  @xcite .",
    "a number of implementations based upon holography have followed .",
    "an early demonstration by lauer is a good example  @xcite .",
    "prior methods have also implemented tomography within a microscope - like setup , but required the addition of a phase - stable reference beam .",
    "early results applied the projection approximation , which models light as a ray  @xcite .",
    "subsequent work has taken the effects of diffraction into account  @xcite .    instead of relying upon holography , this work measures intensity images and computationally recovers the missing phase of each field .",
    "as mentioned above , a few prior works consider the reconstruction problem from detected optical intensities , but must either move the focal plane between measurements , or must assume a sample support constraint .",
    "they do not attempt ptychographic phase retrieval .",
    "one related strategy worth mentioning is lifting - based phase retrieval for tomography  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the first born approximation and phase retrieval has also been explored within the context of volume hologram design  @xcite .",
    "related efforts to reconstruct volumetric samples from wide - field intensity - only measurements outside of the realm of dt include lensless on - chip setups  @xcite , lensless techniques that assume an appropriate linearization  @xcite , and methods relying upon effects like defocus ( e.g. , the transport of intensity equation  @xcite ) or spectral variations  @xcite .",
    "none of these techniques fit within a standard microscope setup , nor offer the ability to simultaneously improve spatial resolution .    based upon a standard microscope",
    ", fourier ptychography ( fp )  @xcite can simultaneously improve image resolution and measure quantitative phase  @xcite .",
    "however , it is restricted to thin samples .",
    "fpt effectively extends prior developments of fp into the third dimension .",
    "two recent works also examined the problem of 3d imaging from intensities in a standard microscope  @xcite .",
    "these two examples adopted their 3d reconstruction technique from the related field of 3d ptychography  @xcite , where the sample under examination is split up into a specified number of infinitesimally thin slices , and the beam propagation method ( i.e. , multi - slice approximation ) is applied  @xcite . unlike the multi - slice approach , which works well with distinctly separated absorbing layers , fpt is best suited for continuous , primarily transparent samples .",
    "a number of related methods to perform 3d x - ray ptychography have also been proposed  @xcite . however , none seem to directly modify dt under the first born or rytov approximation , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "a popular technique appears to use standard 2d ptychographic solvers to determine the complex field for individual projections of a slowly rotated sample , which are subsequently combined using conventional dt techniques , as shown with both crystallographic  @xcite and unordered specimens  @xcite .    here",
    ", we first outline a solid foundation for the application of ptychographic phase retrieval to dt .",
    "unlike approaching the problem from a projection - based or multi - slice perspective , the framework of dt ( under the first born approximation ) follows directly from the scalar wave equation .",
    "it offers a clear picture of achievable resolution in 3d , spells out sampling and data redundancy requirements for an accurate reconstruction , and presents a clear path forward for future extensions to account for multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our method does not require the arbitrary assignment of the number slices in the 3d volume , or their location , or for us to select a particular order in which to address each slice as iterations proceed .",
    "instead , it simply inserts the measured data into its appropriate location in 3d fourier space and ensures phase consistency between each measurement , given a sufficient amount of data redundancy ( just like ptychography ) . from the initial starting point of solving for the first term in the born expansion , we aim this approach as a general framework to eventually solve the challenging problem of forming tomographic maps of volumetric samples , at sub - micrometer resolution , in the presence of significant scattering .",

    "this field then propagates to form @xmath3 at the microscope back focal plane , where it is band - limited by the finite microscope aperture , @xmath4 .",

    "[ ms_sep](b)-(c ) , where we focus to the center of the two layers ( @xmath97 ) as well as the top microsphere layer ( @xmath114 @xmath0 m ) in an attempt to distinguish the two separate layers . at the top of each image ( where microspheres in the two layers overlap ) , it is especially hard to resolve each sphere or determine which sphere is in a particular layer .",
    "these challenges are due in part to the limited ability to measure just the optical intensity at each plane , instead of the complex refractive index of the sample .",
    "next , we return the focus to the @xmath97 plane and implement fpt .",
    "we display three slices of our 3d scattering potential reconstruction in fig .",
    "[ ms_sep](d)-(f ) . here",
    ", we show the absolute value of the potential near the plane of the top layer , at the center , and near the plane of the bottom layer .",
    "the originally indistinguishable spheres within the top and bottom layers are now clearly resolved in each @xmath80-plane . due to the system s limited axial resolution",
    ", the reconstruction at the middle plane ( @xmath97 ) still shows the presence of spheres from both layers . comparing fig .",
    "[ ms_sep](b)-(c ) with fig .",
    "[ ms_sep](e)-(f ) clearly maintains that the axial resolution of fpt is sharper than manual refocusing .",

    ".    -planes .",
    "( b ) refocusing the same distance to each respective plane does not clearly distinguish each in - focus worm segment ( marked by white arrows ) .",
    "since the worm is primarily transparent , in - focus worm sections exhibit minimal intensity contrast , presenting significant challenges for segmentation ( see inset plots of intensity along each black dash , where the section is in - focus in the image on left ) .",
    "fpt , on the other hand , exhibits maximum contrast at each voxel containing the worm . ]",
    "[ worm ]      next , we use fpt to reconstruct the 3d complex refractive index of two different thick biological specimens .",
    "since the exact composition of these specimens is unknown , it is challenging to verify the quantitative accuracy of our reconstructions here , especially given the accuracy of first born approximation is only guaranteed up to a total phase shift of approximately one wavelength .",
    "however , we will point out the multiple qualitative benefits of fpt in these examples .",
    "our first tomographic reconstruction is of a _ trichinella spiralis _",
    "parasite ( fig .",
    "[ worm ] ) . here , since the worm extends along a larger distance than the width of our detector , we performed fpt twice , shifting the fov between to capture the left and right side of the worm with 10% overlap between .",
    "we then merged each tomographic reconstruction together with a simple averaging operation ( matching that from fp  @xcite ) .",
    "the total captured volume here is 0.8 mm@xmath10.4 mm@xmath1110 @xmath0 m .",
    "if we were to replace our current digital detector with one that occupied the entire microscope fov , we would increase our fixed imaging volume to 2.2 mm@xmath12.2 mm@xmath1110 @xmath0 m , and obtain tomograms that each contain approximately @xmath115 voxels per acquisition .",
    "we display a thresholded 3d scattering potential reconstruction of the parasite at the top of fig .",
    "[ worm ] ( real component , threshold applied at @xmath116 > 0.7 $ ] after @xmath117 normalized to 1 , under - sampled for clarity ) .",
    "its 3d curved trajectory is especially clear in the three separate @xmath80-slices of the reconstructed tomogram in fig .",
    "[ worm](a ) .",
    "the two downward bends in the parasite body are lower than the upward bend in the middle , as well as at its front and back ends .",
    "it is very challenging to resolve these depth - dependent sample features by simply refocusing a standard microscope .",
    "[ worm](b ) displays such an attempt , where the same three @xmath80 planes are brought into focus manually .",
    "since the sample is primarily transparent , in - focus areas in each standard image actually exhibit minimal contrast , as marked by arrows in fig .",
    "[ worm](b ) .",
    "we plot the intensity through one worm section ( black dash ) in three insets .",
    "the intensity contrast drops by over a factor of 2 at in - focus locations , which will prevent the success of depth segmentation techniques ( e.g. , focal stack deconvolution  @xcite ) .",
    "since fpt effectively offers phase contrast , points along the parasite within its reconstruction voxels instead show maximum contrast , which enables direct segmentation via thresholding , as achieved in the top plot .",
    "@xmath0 m plane .",
    "likewise , what we expect to be the developing vibratile celia ( see lower right ) are _ only _ visible in the @xmath118 @xmath0 m plane .",
    "( b ) this type of axial information , and even certain structures ( e.g. , the vibratile celia and various epithelia cells , marked in ( a ) ) are completely missing from standard microscope images after manually refocusing to each plane of interest . ]    [ starfish ]    for our second 3d biological example , we tomographically reconstruct a starfish embryo at its larval stage ( fig .",
    "[ starfish ] ) . here",
    ", we again show three different closely spaced @xmath80-slices of the reconstructed scattering potential ( @xmath116 $ ] , no thresholding applied ) .",
    "each @xmath80-slice contains sample features that are not present in the adjacent @xmath80-slices .",
    "for example , the large oval structure in the upper left of the @xmath97 plane , which is a developing stomach , nearly completely disappears in the @xmath119 @xmath0 m plane . now at this @xmath80-slice , however , small structures , which we expect to be the developing vibratile celia as well as epithelia cells at various locations  @xcite , clearly appear in the lower right . both the particular plane of the developing stomach and even the presence of",
    "the vibratile celia are completely missing from the refocused images .",
    "this is due to the inability of the standard microscope to segment each particular plane of interest , the inability to accurately reconstruct transparent structures without a phase contrast mechanism , and an inferior lateral @xmath66 resolution with respect to fpt .",
    "the fpt method performs diffraction tomography using intensity measurements , captured with a standard microscope and an led illuminator .",
    "its reconstruction algorithm extends previous work with fp to now operate in 3d .",
    "the current system offers a lateral resolution of approximately 400 nm at the nyquist - shannon sampling limit ( 550 nm at the sparrow limit and 800 nm full period limit ) , and an axial resolution of 3.7 @xmath0 m at the sampling limit .",
    "the maximum axial extent attempted thus far was 110 @xmath0 m along @xmath80 , which leads to approximately one giga - voxel of complex sampling points per acquisition if imaging over the total microscope fov ( 2.2 @xmath1 2.2 mm ) .",
    "we demonstrated quantitative measurement of the complex index of refraction within thick biological specimens .",
    "we believe that fpt can be significantly improved with additional experimental development .",
    "first , a better led array geometry will enable a higher angle of illumination to improve resolution .",
    "second , we set the number of captured images here to match previously determined data redundancy requirements  @xcite . however , we have observed that reconstructions are successful with much fewer images than otherwise expected . along with using a multiplexed illumination strategy  @xcite , this may help significantly speed up tomogram capture time .",
    "third , we set our reconstruction range along the @xmath80-axis somewhat arbitrarily at 110 @xmath0 m .",
    "we expect the ability to further extend this axial range in future setups .",
    "alternative computational approaches may also improve fpt . here",
    ", we list a number of possible directions .",
    "first , we adopted the well - known alternating projections method ( i.e. , the epie algorithm  @xcite ) for ptychographic update .",
    "other methods , such as convex - based approaches  @xcite , can perform better in the presence of noise .",
    "second , alternative approximations are also available to solve the first born approximation  @xcite .",
    "third , a big detriment to resolution is currently the missing cone in 3d k - space , and various methods are available to fill this cone in , e.g. , by assuming the sample is positive - only , sparse , or of a finite spatial support  @xcite . finally , there are already suggested methods to solve for the full born series , which take into account the effects of multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "connections between this type of multiple scattering solver , recent methods applying the multi - slice approximation  @xcite , and fpt may lead to successful reconstruction of increasingly turbid samples .",
