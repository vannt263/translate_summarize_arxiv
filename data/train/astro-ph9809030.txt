    "studies of the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may hold the key to answering several fundamental questions about these still poorly understood objects .",
    "such questions include i ) what is the physical origin of radio loudness ? , ii ) by what mechanisms are galactic nuclei triggered into activity ( _ e.g. _ smith & heckman 1990 ; hutchings & neff 1992 ; baum , heckman & van breugel 1992 ) ? ,",
    "iii ) which classes of agn can be unified via orientation effects ( peacock 1987 ; barthel 1989 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) , iv ) which classes of agn can or can not be unified via time evolution ( _ e.g. _ ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; baum , zirbel & odea 1995 ) , and how does the recently inferred relation between black - hole mass and galaxy bulge mass ( magorrian _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) extend to high masses ?",
    "furthermore , by defining the parameter space occupied by agn hosts , important constraints can be derived on the fraction of the galaxy population which might contain a dormant agn , constraints which need to be satisfied by any physical model which endeavours to explain the cosmological evolution of active galaxy populations ( dunlop 1997 ; small & blandford 1992 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 , silk & rees 1998 )    determining the properties of the hosts of relatively low - luminosity agn such as seyfert nuclei has proved relatively straightforward since the advent of ccd detectors , and their properties are now relatively well established ( _ e.g. _ mackenty 1990 ) . however , to date the effective ground - based study of the hosts of the more luminous quasars ( _ e.g. _ smith _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 ) has proved to be extremely difficult due to the combination of their larger cosmological distances , and much higher nuclear : host luminosity ratios .",
    "this is unfortunate because a clear understanding of both the differences and similarities between the host galaxies of the three main classes of _ powerful _ active galaxy - radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and radio galaxies ( rgs ) - is obviously of fundamental importance in any attempt to unify or relate the various manifestations of the agn phenomenon .",
    "one way to reduce the distorting influence of the nuclear light is to observe at near - infrared wavelengths where the nuclear : host luminosity ratio can be minimized .",
    "we have previously exploited this fact , while at the same time attempting to minimize cosmological distance , via an extensive @xmath8-band imaging study of the hosts of matched samples of rqqs , rlqs , and rgs in the redshift range @xmath9 ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; taylor _ et al .",
    "this infrared study was successful in that , unlike previous ground - based optical studies , it proved possible to determine reliably the morphological type of a substantial fraction ( @xmath10 ) of the quasar hosts .",
    "moreover , the use of properly matched samples allowed us to demonstrate that the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn were large ( @xmath11 kpc ) , luminous ( @xmath12 ) galaxies , and that the hosts of rlqs and rgs were statistically identical , consistent with unified models .",
    "we also found that at least some of the rqqs appeared to lie in elliptical rather than disc - like galaxies , and there was a suggestion in our data that the probability of an rqq having an elliptical host is an increasing function of quasar luminosity .",
    "however we were unable to prove this effect was significant due to the fact that the morphologies of the hosts of the more luminous rqqs in our sample remained ambiguous with the limitations of ground - based seeing .",
    "this drawback , coupled with the desirability of obtaining reliable optical - infrared colours for all the host galaxies in our agn sample led us to undertake a complementary @xmath3-band imaging study of this same sample with wfpc2 on the hst . here",
    "we report the first results of this , the most detailed hst study to date of the host galaxies of quasars and radio galaxies .    while the observed nuclear : host luminosity ratio of a quasar is inevitably much higher at @xmath3 than at @xmath8 , the high spatial resolution offered by hst allows the nuclear contamination to be confined to the central regions of the host galaxy image , thus enhancing the prospects of reliable determination of host galaxy morphology , luminosity and scalelength .",
    "this resolution advantage has previously been explored in a number of pilot hst studies of small samples of quasars ( disney _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; bachall , kirkhados & schneider 1994,1995a , b , c ; hutchings _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; hutchings & morris 1995 ) although it comes with the price that the nucleus inevitably saturates in any hst image of sufficient depth to produce a useful image of the underlying host . as a result it has proved difficult to perform accurate subtraction of the nuclear contribution , which is still vitally important for the reliable determination of host galaxy properties ( hutchings 1995 ) . a second problem with some previous hst studies",
    "has been the use of filters which have included strong emission lines , making it difficult to discern which host galaxy features can be reliably attributed to starlight ( bachall , kirkhados & schneider 1995a ) . a third problem has been the use of the wide @xmath13-band filter , which fails to properly sample the dominant stellar population of the host ( at @xmath14 ) for @xmath15 ( bachall , kirkhados & schneider 1994 ) .",
    "a fourth problem has been the unavailability of an accurate point spread function ( psf ) of sufficient depth to investigate the contribution of the quasar nucleus at large radii ( @xmath16 arcsec ) due to the problem of scattered light within wfpc2 .    as described in more detail below , our new 34-orbit hst @xmath3-band study of the hosts of rqqs , rlqs and",
    "rgs has been designed to overcome these problems and differs from previous hst studies of quasar hosts in five important ways .",
    "first , we are imaging statistically comparable samples of each class of agn .",
    "second , we already possess deep infrared images of all our targets , which will allow the first meaningful study of the optical - infrared colours of quasar hosts .",
    "third , we have used the f675w @xmath3-band filter , and restricted the redshift range of our targets , in order to ensure that the images are always uncontaminated by emission lines , and always sample the rest frame emission of the host galaxy longward of the 4000  break .",
    "fourth , we have devoted an orbit of our hst observing programme to assembling an accurate point spread function of sufficient dynamic range to accurately define the contribution of the quasar nucleus out to an angular radius @xmath17 arcsec .",
    "fifth , we have developed and applied a 2-dimensional modelling procedure which allows us to reliably extract the morphology , luminosity and size of the host galaxies from our images , without requiring us to make asumptions _ a priori _ about the values of these parameters ( which contrasts with the analysis of bachall , kirkhados & schneider ( 1994 ) as highlighted by mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "the results presented here from the first year of this study demonstrate the importance of these five improvements .",
    "in particular , whereas most previous hst studies have tended to highlight the fact that many quasar hosts display a wide range of morphological peculiarities , our study is already revealing a surprising degree of similarity and homogeneity in the distribution and age of the dominant stellar populations in the hosts of these powerful agn .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main properties of the matched rg , rlq and rqq samples which are the subject of this hst study , and then in section 3 we give details of the observations , image reduction and psf determination . in section 4",
    "we present the images , list and summarize the results of applying our host - galaxy modelling procedure to these data , and provide brief notes on the images of each of the 19 agn observed to date in the context of previous observations . in section 5",
    "we discuss the main implications of the trends uncovered by the initial results of this study , and in section 6 we summarize our principle conclusions . unless otherwise stated @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 are assumed throughout , and we convert previously published scalelengths and luminosities to this cosmology for ease of comparison .",
    "the full sample selected for hst imaging consists of 33 objects ( 10 rlqs , 12 rqqs and 11 rgs ) selected from the slightly larger statistically - matched samples which were imaged in the near - infrared by dunlop _",
    "( 1993 ) and taylor _ et al . _",
    "full details of these samples can be found in these papers .",
    "the key point is that the rlq and rqq sub - samples were selected to be statistically indistinguishable in terms of optical luminosity and redshift , while the rlq and rg sub - samples were selected to be indistinguishable in terms of radio luminosity , radio spectral index and redshift .",
    "note that following the radio observations of kukula _ et al . _",
    "( 1998a ) we now possess either a radio detection or a strong upper limit on radio luminosity for all the rqqs in our sample , making it possible to quantify their ` radio quietness ' , and hence explore the extent to which this can be related to any properties of the host galaxy ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the original combined sample comprised a total of 40 objects ( 12 rgs , 13 rlqs and 15 rqqs ) with @xmath21 , but for this hst study we have restricted the redshift range in order to avoid [ oiii ] emission entering the blue end of the f675w filter .",
    "this results in the slightly smaller sub - samples described above , without compromising their statistical compatibility .",
    "the 19 objects which have been observed during the first year of this study , and for which we present the data in this first paper , are listed in table 1 , along with dates on which they were observed with the hst .",
    "observations were made with the wide field & planetary camera 2 ( _ wfpc2 _ ; trauger _",
    "1994 ) on the hubble space telescope using the f675w filter .",
    "the filter spans 877   in the wavelength range 6275.5  7152.5 , roughly equivalent to standard @xmath3 band , and thus excludes both [ oiii ] @xmath22 and h@xmath23 emission for redshifts @xmath24 ( a wider filter , although providing greater throughput , would have allowed our images to become contaminated by line emission which could mask or at least be confused with the underlying stellar continuum of the host galaxy ) .    _",
    "wfpc2 _ consists of four detectors , each comprising @xmath25 pixels : three wf chips , each with a pixel scale of 100  mas ; and one pc chip , with a pixel scale of 45  mas .",
    "although the pc chip offers smaller pixels and correspondingly better sampling of the instrument point spread function ( psf ) , it is ultimately less sensitive to low surface brightness emission than the wf chips , even when the pixels are binned up , and we therefore opted to use the larger detectors .",
    "target sources were centred on the wf2 chip , which was chosen for its marginally better performance over the period immediately prior to our observations .",
    "observations of the target quasars and radio galaxies were carefully tailored to ensure that the maximum amount of information could be derived from the final images . in both cases",
    "deep , sensitive images of the galaxies are clearly desirable , but for the quasars such exposure times inevitably entail saturation of the central source , allowing no independent measure of psf normalization .",
    "slightly different strategies were therefore used for the quasar and radio galaxy samples . for the quasars , exposures of 5 , 26 and @xmath26",
    "seconds were taken .",
    "the short exposures guaranteed that at least one unsaturated image of the quasar would be obtained , thus ensuring an accurate measure of the central flux density .",
    "the three 600-second exposures each provided a @xmath27 surface brightness sensitivity @xmath28 mag .",
    "( per pixel ) , and their comparison facilitated reliable cosmic ray removal using standard iraf tasks . with azimuthal averaging ,",
    "the combined 1800-second deep image of each quasar allows extended emission to be traced reliably out to a surface brightness level @xmath30 mag .",
    "arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "for the radio galaxies there was little danger of saturation and so short exposures were not required .",
    "three 700-second exposures were therefore obtained for each radio galaxy .",
    "any remaining time in the orbit was filled with an exposure of flexible length ( usually 40 to 100 seconds ) .",
    "the sources discussed in this paper - constituting approximately half of our sample - were all observed between june 1997 and april 1998 ( see table 1 for exact dates ) .",
    "calibration was carried out using the standard pipeline .",
    "the form of the _ wfpc2 _ point spread function depends critically on both the position on the chip and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the target source .",
    "these effects are well - understood and can be included in software to produce accurate synthetic psfs .",
    "however , despite providing an excellent fit over the central few arcseconds , the synthetic psfs produced by packages such as tinytim deviate from the empirical _ wfpc2 _ psf at larger radii ( @xmath31  arsec ) .",
    "this is due to scattering within the camera .",
    "since the scattered light shows complex structure which is not uniform , and which is also wavelength and position dependent , it can not easily be modelled .",
    "we have therefore devoted one orbit of our allotted hst time to constructing a deep , unsaturated stellar psf using the f675w filter , with the star centred on exactly the same part of the wf2 chip as the target objects .    the star chosen was grw  + 70d5824 , a white dwarf of spectral type da3 and apparent magnitude @xmath32 .",
    "since it also serves as a uv standard star for _",
    "wfpc2 _ the position and spectrum of this object are extremely well determined ( turnshek _ et al .",
    "no stars of a comparable brightness lie within 30  arcsec , ensuring that the stellar psf is not contaminated by psfs or scattered light from neighbouring objects .",
    "the @xmath33 colour of the psf star is -0.09 , sufficiently similar to the neutral colours ( @xmath34 ) typical of our quasar sample to provide a reasonable match to a quasar sed over the wavelength range of the f675w filter .    in order to obtain both unsaturated images of the psf core _ and",
    "_ deep images of the wings , a series of exposures was carried out with durations of 0.23 , 2 , 26 and 160 seconds .",
    "after 0.23 seconds the central pixel of the stellar image reaches approximately 10% of its saturation value ( assuming that the star is perfectly centred ) .",
    "this is the shortest practical exposure length - in exposures of less than 0.23 seconds the psf would be compromised by the shutter flight time .",
    "subsequent exposure durations were carefully staggered to ensure that the star never saturated beyond the radius at which the wings of the psf in the previous , shorter exposure became lost in the noise .",
    "this allowed us to build up a composite psf of very high dynamic range by splicing together annuli from successively deeper exposures .",
    "the brightest quasar in our sample has an apparent magnitude of @xmath35 , more than two magnitudes fainter than the psf star .",
    "we were therefore able to ensure that the deepest stellar image probed much further into the wings of the psf than even the longest quasar exposure .",
    "each exposure also used a two - point dither pattern to improve the sampling of the psf ( which is significantly undersampled by the 0.1  arcsec pixel scale of the wf chips ) .",
    "thus , the stellar psf is designed to match the psfs of the target quasars as closely as possible in terms of depth , position on the detector and spectral energy distribution .",
    "however , we note that we can not account for time - dependent variations in the psf using this method .",
    "these variations are due to changes in the telescope focus and include contributions from several sources .",
    "of these the most significant for our observations is the short - term ( intra - orbit ) variability ( ` breathing ' ) due to temperature fluctuations in the telescope s environment .",
    "however , with the relatively large pixel scale of the wf chips the effect on the amount of flux falling on the central pixel of a point source is likely to be only a few percent at most .",

    "is shown in the top left panel ( panel a ) of each figure 1a@xmath361s , which shows a region 12.5 @xmath37 12.5 arcsec centred on the target source .",

    "all panels are displayed using the same greyscale .",
    "full details of the 2-dimensional modelling procedure which we have used to determine the properties of the host galaxies are presented elsewhere , along with the results of extensive tests of its ability to reclaim the true properties of a wide range of host - galaxy : nucleus combinations at different redshifts ( mclure et al .",
    "1998b ) . in brief",
    ", the modelling procedure is a development of that used by taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and here we have used two distinct versions of this procedure to determine the host - galaxy properties from our hst images . for both versions an accurate high - dynamic range psf and an accurate error frame for each quasar image are essential for the extracton of robust results ( see mclure et al .",
    "1998b for details ) .    in the first version",
    "the host galaxy morphology is constrained by determining how well the data can be reproduced _ assuming _ that the host galaxy is _ either _ an elliptical galaxy ( described by a de vaucouleurs @xmath38-law ) or an exponential disc . the remaining five parameters ( host - galaxy position angle , host - galaxy axial ratio , host - galaxy scalelength , host - galaxy luminosity and nuclear luminosity ) are then varied until , when convolved with the psf , the model best fits the data as determined by @xmath39-squared minimization ( note that it is not assumed _ a priori _ that the radio galaxies have a negligible nuclear component ) .",
    "then , if one assumed galaxy morphology yields a significantly better fit than the other , we can say that the galaxy is _ better",
    "_ described by a de vaucouleurs law or by an exponential disc .",
    "the results of applying this procedure to the hst images are given in table 2 .",
    "the striking feature of these results is that all of the host galaxies except those of the two lowest luminosity rqqs are better described as elliptical galaxies , and that , with only one exception ( the heavily nuclear dominated rqq 0953@xmath40415 ) , this difference is statistically very significant .",
    "one dimensional luminosity profiles extracted from the best - fitting de vaucouleurs or exponential models are compared with the data in figure 2 .    in the second version",
    "we have removed the need to assume that the host galaxy can be decribed by either a pure @xmath38-law or exponential disc , and allow a sixth parameter @xmath41 ( where the luminosity profile of profile of the galaxy is given by @xmath42 ) to vary continuously .",
    "thus , @xmath43 should result if the galaxy is best described by a pure exponential disc , and @xmath44 should result if the galaxy really does follow a pure de vaucouleurs law , but _ all _ values of @xmath41 are available to the program to improve the quality of the model fit",
    ". the impressive results of applying this procedure to the hst images are given in table 3 and illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "one remarkable feature of these results ( see figure 3 ) is that for 16 out of the 19 objects , the preferred @xmath41 parameter for the host galaxy is in the range @xmath45 , in excellent agreement with a pure de vaucouleurs law .",
    "perhaps most surprisingly , given pre - existing prejudices , this is true for 6 out of the 9 rqqs in the current sub - sample .",
    "moreover , the only two rqqs which appear to have a significant disc component are the two least luminous rqqs in this subsample .",
    "the clear implication is that _ all _ bright quasars , with @xmath46 reside in massive ellipticals , irrespective of their radio power .",
    "such a result has been hinted at before ( taylor _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; disney _ et al .",

    "the most striking initial result of this study is that our observing strategy combined with modelling incorporating a high dynamic range psf has enabled us not only to easily detect all of the host galaxies observed to date , but also to determine unambiguously the morphological type of the host in virtually every case ( see tables 2 & 3 , and figures 2 & 3 ) .",

    "thus , whatever the true physical origin of radio loudness , it is clearly not simply a consequence of the morphological type of the host galaxy .",
    "a particularly striking feature of this result is the extent to which a pure @xmath38 law provides an essentially perfect description ( apart from obvious tidal tails and secondary nuclei ) of the hosts of 16 out of the 19 agn observed in our sample to date .",

    "the homogeneity of these host galaxies is striking when they are plotted on the @xmath108 projection of the fundamental plane ( see figure 6 ) where we find that they describe a kormendy relation essentially identical to that displayed by ` normal ' massive ellipticals ( schneider , gunn & hoessel 1983 ; capaccioli , caon & donofrio 1992 ) ; a least - squares fit yields the relationship @xmath109 .",
    "thus the basic morphological parameters of these host galaxies appear to be indistinguishable from those of normal , inactive massive ellipticals .",

    "the axial ratios yielded by the model - fitting are given in table 2 , and the resulting host - galaxy axial - ratio distribution is plotted in figure 7 .",
    "it is perfectly consistent with the distribution displayed by normal ellipticals and , with only one object displaying an axial ratio @xmath111 , is completely at odds with the recent results of hooper _ et al . _",

    ". however hooper _ et al .",
    "_ expressed the concern that their result might reflect high - surface brightness features such as bars or tidal tails , rather than the axial ratio of the underlying stellar population , and our very different result , based on proper modelling of the underlying host , indicates that this is almost certainly the correct explanation for their apparently contradictory conclusion .",
    "one of the reasons we elected to use the f675w filter rather than the f606w filter used by bahcall _",
    "_ was the evidence , gleaned from our deep off - nuclear spectroscopy of quasar hosts ( kukula _ et al .",
    "_ 1998b ; hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , that most quasar hosts appear to be rather red galaxies with a clear 4000  break in their spectrum .",
    "we are now , for the first time , in a position to check whether this is indeed the case by combining our new @xmath3-band hst results with the @xmath8-band results of taylor _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) to measure the @xmath1 colours of the rgs and quasar hosts .",
    "the results are listed in table 4 , and plotted in figure 8 , where the observed colours are compared with those predicted from simple @xmath113-correction of stellar populations with ages of 8 , 12 and 16 gyr ( guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath1 colours of the radio galaxies is only @xmath114 mag , and it is striking that these 4 objects track almost perfectly the @xmath113-correction derived from the sed of an old ( 12 gyr ) elliptical galaxy .",
    "the uncertainties associated with removal of the nuclear contribution mean that the @xmath1 colours of the quasar hosts are somewhat more uncertain ( @xmath115 mag . )",
    "but with the present data it is clear that the hosts of all 3 classes of powerful agn have colours which are consistent with each other , and with that of old passively evolving stellar populations .",
    "model independent support for this conclusion can be gleaned by comparing figure 8 with the @xmath1 versus @xmath67 plot for objects detected in a @xmath8-band survey reaching @xmath116 ( glazebrook _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) ; the host galaxy @xmath1 colours shown in figure 8 track well the red envelope displayed by @xmath8-band selected galaxies at comparable redshifts .",
    "this is the first clear evidence that the dominant stellar populations in not only rgs , but also quasar hosts have ages comparable to the oldest known elliptical galaxies , and thus must have formed at high redshift ( @xmath117 ; dunlop _ et al .",
    "it also means that any substantial star - formation activity associated with the triggering of agn activity must either be dust enshrouded , or confined either to the nuclear regions of the galaxy ( in which case it will have been attributed to the quasar nucleus in our modelling procedure ) or to obvious tidal tails , which we have excised prior to modelling the host galaxy .      as can be seen from panel d in figures 1a@xmath361s , removal of the axisymmetric model for the underlying host galaxy makes it relatively easy to identify morphological peculiarities such as excess flux , tidal tails , interacting companions and secondary nuclei , often at considerably lower surface brightness levels than the more obvious morphological distortions masked out prior to host - galaxy modelling .",
    "a full statistical analysis of the prevalence and strength of such features is deferred until completion of the sample , but here we simply note that , despite our basic conclusion that the host galaxies are relatively passive massive ellipticals , 3 out of the 4 rgs , 5 out of the 6 rlqs and 6 out of the 9 rqqs observed to date show one or other of the morphological peculiarities mentioned above .",
    "this tally serves to emphasize that most of these agn may have been triggered into action by the interaction of their ( perhaps previously completely passive ) host galaxy with a companion object .",
    "however , we add the cautionary note that the true significance of such apparently impressive interaction statistics ( 14 out of 19 agn ) can only really be judged against the results of a comparably - detailed investigation of the morphologies of ` inactive ' massive ellipticals .",
    "the absolute magnitudes @xmath118 of the fitted nuclear components are given in table 4 , and the resulting distribution is presented in figure 9 .",
    "the nuclear absolute magnitudes are then plotted against the host absolute magnitudes in figure 10 .",
    "only a weak correlation ( @xmath119 , using the spearman rank correlation test ) is seen , consistent with our previous finding at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the fact that the hosts of the two faintest quasars in our sample contain a significant disc component suggests that a more significant correlation might be revealed if only bulge luminosity is considered for comparison with nuclear power . this possibility is explored below in the context of recent studies of nearby galaxies which suggest that black hole mass does indeed depend primarily on bulge mass rather than total galaxy mass .",
    "our unambiguous finding that all the quasars in our sample with @xmath46 lie in massive elliptical galaxies , irrespective of radio power , clearly refutes the long - standing hypothesis that , like the majority of seyferts , radio - quiet quasars lie in predominantly disc galaxies .",
    "however , if it is accepted that all quasars ( radio - loud and quiet ) result from accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole , then our result can be seen as a natural consequence of the black - hole / spheroid mass correlation recently derived in nearby galaxies by magorrian _",
    "( 1998 ) , as we now briefly explain .",
    "magorrian _ et al .",
    "_ find that the available kinematic data on nearby galaxies are consistent with the relation @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the mass of the hot stellar component ( _ i.e. _ the spheroidal bulge ) , strengthening the previous conclusion of kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) .",
    "they also show that @xmath121 can be estimated from the luminosity of the spheroidal component using a mass : light ratio which is proportional to @xmath122 ( their equation ( 10 ) ) , broadly consistent with the fundamental - plane correlation predicted using the virial theorem ( _ e.g. _ bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) .",
    "since we now possess the first reliable determinations of the spheroid luminosity for the hosts of a significant sample of agn , we have explored the result of applying these two relations to estimate ( albeit rather crudely ) the spheroidal mass @xmath123 of each host , and hence the _ expected _ mass of the black hole at the centre of each galaxy .",
    "the results of this calculation are listed in table 5 , columns 2 and 3 .",
    "we have then proceeded to calculate the eddington luminosity , eddington temperature , and hence eddington absolute magnitude @xmath118 for the putative black hole at the centre of each host galaxy , and the results of this calculation are given in column 6 of table 5 , and compared with the observed nuclear absolute magnitude of each quasar ( _ i.e. _ after host galaxy removal ) in figure 11 .    in our view",
    "this is a surprisingly successful calculation .",
    "as can be seen from figure 11 , the maximum luminosity produced by any quasar is comparable with the predicted eddington limit , while the majority appear to be radiating at a few per cent of the eddington luminosity . moreover , despite the large number of sources of potential scatter , the correlation between observed @xmath118 and predicted eddington @xmath118 is stronger ( @xmath124 ) than that between raw host - galaxy luminosity and nuclear - luminosity ( and becomes marginally significant ( @xmath125 ) if 0953@xmath40415 is excluded from the analysis ) , and both the radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars display a similar relation .",
    "this suggests that in both classes of quasar the _ optical _ luminosity arises from a similar process of accretion onto a massive black hole , and that rlqs and rqqs of comparable absolute magntiude @xmath46 are powered by black holes of comparable mass @xmath126 .",
    "the results of this calculation can be regarded as providing independent evidence that the relation of magorrian _ et al .",
    "_ still applies for large galaxy and black hole masses . to reiterate , this relation would predict that such massive black holes can only be housed in galaxies with a spheroid mass of @xmath127 which is equivalent to an absolute magnitude of @xmath128 , which is exactly what we find .",
    "galaxies with such massive spheroidal components must inevitably be classed as giant ellipticals , in which case it could be regarded as a ( now successful ) prediction of the black - hole / spheroid mass relation that all luminous quasars must reside in massive elliptical galaxies more luminous than @xmath129 .",
    "finally we combine our estimates of black hole mass derived from host - galaxy spheroid mass ( table 5 ) with the radio data available to us for each object to investigate how our results compare with the radio - luminosity  black - hole mass correlations recently derived for low - redshift galaxies by franceschini , vercellone & fabian ( 1998 ) .",

    "were able to determine @xmath130 directly from high - resolution spectroscopy , the value of @xmath130 plotted for each of our agn has of course had to been inferred from the mass of the spheroidal component of its host galaxy .",
    "however , the location of our agn on this diagram , particularly the radio - loud agn , strongly suggests that our host - galaxy - based black hole mass estimates are reasonable , despite the large uncertainties involved in extrapolating from spheroid luminosity .    to put this another way",
    ", one can derive two completely independent estimates the mass of the black hole at the heart of each of our agn using either i ) the luminosity of the host spheroid and the relations given by magorrian _",
    "_ as described above , or ii ) the @xmath132:@xmath130 regression line of franceschini _ et al .",
    "_ shown in figure 12a , and for the radio loud agn in our sample these values agree to within a factor of typically 2 ( r.m.s . - see columns 3 and 4 of table 5 ) .",
    "since the rgs and rlqs appear so consistent with the @xmath133 relation , it is inevitable that the rqqs should lie below it , but a striking feature of figure 12a is that ( albeit that a number of upper limits are involved ) , there does still appear to be a correlation between radio - luminosity and host - galaxy - derived @xmath130 within the rqq subsample .",
    "this suggests that the radio luminosities of the rqqs might also be linked to those of lower mass objects via a simple relation . since the study of kukula _",
    "( 1998 ) has shown that the radio emission from these rqqs , where detectable , arises entirely from a compact core - like component , we have therefore investigated whether the radio properties of rqqs can be linked to those of nearby galaxies if only compact radio emission is included .",
    "this is explored in figure 12b .",
    "et al . _ also found a strong correlation between core 5ghz radio luminosity and black hole mass , and so we have again reproduced their data for nearby galaxies , this time plotting @xmath134 versus @xmath130 , along with the relation @xmath135 expected for simple advection - dominated accretion models ( fabian & rees 1995 ) , or indeed for any model in which the emission is mostly dependent of the emitting area available around a black hole .",
    "we have replotted all the rqq data points shown in figure 12a , but this time have only plotted datapoints for the cores of the lobe - dominated radio - loud agn ( to minimize the impact of beaming ; giovannini _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ; clarke _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; lister & gower 1994 ) .",
    "we note that in this case the rqqs apparently form a natural extension of the local galaxy sample , as do the least luminous cores of the radio - loud agn , and that the plotted relation provides an excellent description of the data .",
    "a number of points are worthy of comment .",
    "first , unlike franceschini _",
    "_ we have attributed all the radio emission from m31 ( after removal of very extended radio emission linked to star - formation ) to the core because the agn contribution in m31 would in fact remain unresolved at the distance of most of the objects in even the local sample ; this appears to the reason that we find the core radio data to be linked to @xmath130 through a flatter relation @xmath136 than did franceschini _",
    "et al._. second , it is noteworthy that m87 moves from the ` radio - loud ' relation in figure 12a , to the ` radio - quiet ' relation in figure 12b once its extended radio emision is removed , as do several of the radio - loud agn .",
    "third , as is clear from the figure , for several of the rqqs we currently only possess upper limits on radio luminosity ; if @xmath134 and @xmath121 really are both good indicators of the black hole mass in these objects , then we would predict that the radio emission from these rqqs should be detected by radio observations reaching only an order of magnitude below the current limits .    because it is undoubtedly possible that @xmath134 is a better indicator of black hole mass than is @xmath121 , we have used the relation shown in figure 12b to obtain an independent prediction of @xmath130 for each quasar , and the results",
    "are presented in column 5 of table 5 . in figure 13",
    "we plot @xmath130 derived from @xmath134 against @xmath130 derived from host galaxy luminosity .",
    "these _ completely independent estimates _ of @xmath130 are clearly extremely well correlated ( @xmath137 ) , and for individual sources the discrepancy is no greater than a factor of 4 , and is frequently smaller .",
    "however , use of the @xmath138 relation shown in figure 12b , does tend to yield smaller black hole masses for the rqqs than the use of @xmath121 .      despite the good agreement between the black hole masses of the radio - loud agn as estimated from @xmath139 and host galaxy luminosity , it seems unlikely that the relation shown in figure 12a can be a fair indicator of the black hole masses in the rqqs because then the more luminous rqqs such as 0054@xmath40144 would appear to have an optical luminosity an order of magnitude greater than the eddington luminosity .",
    "this leaves either @xmath134 or host - galaxy luminosity as potential alternative estimators of black - hole mass , and while figure 13 demonstrates that both quantities lead to reasonably consistent values for @xmath130 , the implications for the physical origin of radio loudness depend rather crucially on which of these is the more reliable predictor of @xmath130 .",
    "the reason for this is that , for the radio - loud objects , comparison of columns 3 , 4 and 5 in table 5 shows that essentially all routes of black - hole mass estimation lead to values of @xmath140 .",
    "however , for the rqqs , use of @xmath134 to estimate @xmath130 produces values typically a factor of two smaller than inferred from host - galaxy luminosity , and implies that _ no _ rqq in the sample has a black hole more massive than @xmath141 .",
    "there is already a suggestion in figure 11 that , despite the comparable observed absolute magnitudes of the rqqs and rlqs , the predicted eddington luminosities of the rqqs are somewhat smaller .",
    "if the values of @xmath130 derived from @xmath134 are use to predict eddington @xmath118 , the difference becomes even more stark ( as shown in figure 14 ) , and shows that in selecting optically matched samples of rqqs and rlqs we may in fact have selected lower mass ( @xmath142 ) black holes radiating close to the eddington limit for comparison with higher mass ( @xmath143 ) black holes radiating ( in the optical ) at around 10% of their eddington luminosity .    in summary , our results to date can be interpreted in two distinct ways depending on whether @xmath134 or host - galaxy luminosity is the the more reliable predictor of black hole mass .",
    "if the former , then the difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn may simply be that frii radio sources require black holes of mass @xmath140 .",
    "if the latter , then at least some of the rqqs in our sample would also appear to be powered by black holes with @xmath140 , and some other explanation ( _ e.g. _ black hole angular momentum ) would be required to explain why black holes of comparable mass can produce radio sources which differ by two orders of magnitude in radio power , despite the fact that both are radiating in the optical with comparable efficiency .",
    "completion of our sample , coupled with proposed deeper radio observations of the as yet undetected rqqs should assist in clarifying this issue .",
    "in this paper we have presented and analyzed the deep wfpc2 r675w images of the 19 objects ( rgs , rlqs and rqqs ) observed with the hst during the first year of our comparative hst imaging study of the host galaxies of luminous agn .",
    "the results indicate that this carefully controlled study will , as hoped , be able to identify unambiguously the morphological type of the host galaxy of every agn in our final 33-source sample . from the images analyzed in this paper we find that the underlying hosts of _ all three _ classes of luminous agn are massive elliptical galaxies , with scalelengths @xmath0 kpc . since the rqq sub - sample is already close to completion we can therefore for the first time state with some confidence that essentially all rqqs brighter than @xmath2 reside in massive ellipticals , a a result which removes the possibility that radio ` loudness ' is directly linked to host galaxy morphology .    the existence of comparably detailed modelling of deep @xmath8-band images of all the sources in our sample ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; taylor _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) has allowed us to use our new @xmath3-band results to derive the first reliable optical - infrared colours for the hosts of a substantial sample of agn .",
    "the preliminary results indicate that the hosts of all three classes of agn have underlying stellar populations with ages comparable to that observed in normal , old ellipticals at similar redshift , despite the evidence for superimposed acivity arising from interactions / mergers .",
    "we also find that the distribution of host - galaxy axial ratios is consistent with that displayed by the normal elliptical galaxy population .",
    "the rg and rlq sub - samples have been designed to be matched in terms of radio luminosity , radio spectral index , and redshift .",
    "comparison of the host galaxy properties of the ( still small ) rg and rlq sub - sub - samples observed to date indicates that their hosts are indistinguishable in terms of morphological type , luminosity , axial ratio , and @xmath1 colour , consistent with unification via orientation .    the rqq and rlq samples were designed to be matched in terms of optical luminosity and redshift , and the image analysis presented here indicates that , with the exception of two low - luminosity interlopers in the rqq sample ( 0257@xmath40024 and 2344@xmath40184 , which should really be reclassified as seyferts ) the distribution of nuclear absolute magnitudes of the rqq and rlq sub - samples do indeed appear to be well matched .",
    "interestingly , therefore , with the exception of 0257@xmath40024 and 2344@xmath40184 , we find the host galaxies of the rqqs to also be massive elliptical galaxies , albeit approximately 0.5 mag fainter on average than their radio - loud counterparts . with the present sub - samples this difference is not significant , but",
    "when the black hole mass in these quasars is inferred from the luminosity of their host spheroid , it implies that the typical black hole mass for the rqqs in our sample is @xmath144 , while for the rlqs it is @xmath145 , and that several of the luminous rqqs we have selected are radiating close to their eddington limit ( whereas very few of the rlqs appear to be radiating at more than @xmath0% of predicted eddington luminosity ) .",
    "finally we find that the black hole mass estimates obtained from the luminosity of the host spheroid are in good agreement with independent estimates based on extrapolation of the relation between black - hole mass and core radio luminosity established for nearby galaxies , and it seems hard to escape the conclusion that all the radio - loud agn in our sample have black hole masses in excess of @xmath146 .",
    "however , if the latter relation is adopted as the most reliable estimator we would conclude that our rqq sample is even more biased towards objects emitting close to their eddington limit , and contains no object powered by a black hole as massive as @xmath146 .",
    "if this is correct , then the physical origin of radio loudness ( @xmath147 ) may simply be the presence of a black hole more massive than @xmath146 , and this relatively clean result may have been previously concealed from us by the selection effects involved in striving to produce a bright rqq sample for comparison with a ( radio - selected ) rlq sample , coupled with substantial scatter in the @xmath130:host - luminosity relation . alternatively ,",
    "if our values of @xmath130 derived from host - galaxy spheroid luminosity are more reliable , then at least some of the rqqs in our sample would have black hole masses @xmath148 , comparable to rlqs , and some explanation other than simply black hole mass would still be required to account for the fact that the rlqs are two orders of magnitude more luminous at radio wavelengths . completion of our hst study , coupled with deeper radio observations of the as - yet - undetected rqqs should help to distinguish between these two alternative scenarios .",

    "<S> we present the first results from a major hst _ </S>",
    "<S> wfpc2 _ imaging study aimed at providing the first statistically meaningful comparison of the morphologies , luminosities , scalelengths and colours of the host galaxies of radio - quiet quasars , radio - loud quasars , and radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the design of this study and present the images which have now been obtained for approximately the first half of our 33-source sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also report and discuss the results of combining high - dynamic range psf determination with 2-dimensional modelling to extract the key parameters of the host galaxies of these agn ; this is the first substantial study of quasar hosts in which it is proving possible to determine unambiguously the morphological type of the hosts of all quasars in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> a full statistical analysis is deferred until the complete sample has been observed , but within the sub - sample presented here we have already obtained some remarkably clean results . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the underlying hosts of all three classes of luminous agn are massive elliptical galaxies , with scalelengths @xmath0 kpc , and @xmath1 colours consistent with old stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly this is the the first unambiguous evidence that , just like radio - loud quasars , essentially all radio - quiet quasars brighter than @xmath2 reside in massive ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> this result removes the possibility that radio ` loudness ' is directly linked to host galaxy morphology , but is however in excellent accord with the black - hole / spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by magorrian _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) . to demonstrate this we apply the spheroid luminosity / spheroid mass / black - hole mass relations given by magorrian _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ to infer the expected eddington luminosity ( and hence maximum expected nuclear @xmath3-band luminosity ) of the putative black hole at the centre of each of the spheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the predicted eddington luminosities with the actual nuclear @xmath3-band luminosities produces a clear relationship , and suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies are radiating at a few percent of the eddington luminosity ( although a few appear to be radiating close to the eddington limit ) ; the brightest host galaxies in our low - redshift sample are capable of hosting quasars with @xmath4 , comparable to the most luminous quasars at @xmath5 , if fueled at the eddington rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss our host - galaxy - derived black - hole masses in the context of the radio - luminosity : black - hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearby galaxies by franceschini _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radio loud agn ( both rgs and rlqs ) lie on the @xmath6 relation , while the rqqs lie on the @xmath7 relation . </S>",
    "<S> this finding may hold the key to identifying the physical origin of the radio - loud radio - quiet dichotomy . </S>"
