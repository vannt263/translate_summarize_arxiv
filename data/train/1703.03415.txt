    "while a static magnetic field can not change the kinetic energy of charged particles , it affects the direction of their motion due to a lorentz force .",
    "this property is widely used in physics and technology .",
    "for example , magnetic fields play a crucial role in cyclotrons and particle accelerators , where they keep beams of charged particles on correct trajectories .",
    "another application is the mass spectrometry , which utilizes magnetic fields in order to sort charged particles based on their mass - to - charge ratio .",
    "magnetic fields can be also used as lenses for deflecting and focusing beams of charged particles .",
    "such lenses are utilized , for example , in cathode ray tubes and electron microscopes @xcite .",
    "the history of geometric electron optics started from a paper by hans busch in 1926 @xcite , where he suggested that the magnetic field of a short coil can act as a converging lens for electrons .",
    "this proposal was instrumental for the construction of the first electron microscope by knoll and ruska @xcite . owing to the fact that the wavelengths of electrons can be much smaller than the wavelengths of the visible light",
    ", the resolution of the electron microscope quickly surpassed that of the conventional optical microscope .",
    "modern transmission electron microscopes with aberrations correctors achieve a few orders of magnitude better resolution than the usual light microscopes and , therefore , are used to investigate the structure of metals , crystals , large molecules , as well as biological specimens including microorganisms and cells .    in geometrical particle optics ,",
    "the motion of charged particles in macroscopic electromagnetic fields is described analogously to the propagation of the light rays .",
    "mathematically , the possibility of such a description stems from the eikonal or wentzel  kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the eikonal approximation is an appropriate and efficient means to solve wave equations in the case when the de broglie wavelengths of particles are small compared to the characteristic inhomogeneities of the system or external fields . in mathematical physics ,",
    "the wkb approximation is a well - established method for finding approximate solutions to linear differential equations with coefficients varying slowly in space @xcite .",
    "recent experimental discovery of dirac and weyl materials made possible a condensed - matter realization of the systems whose low - energy quasiparticles are massless dirac or weyl fermions ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticles have a well - defined chirality in the vicinity of dirac points or weyl nodes .",
    "in this connection it should be noted that a dirac point in the brillouin zone could be viewed as an overlap of two weyl nodes of opposite chirality . according to the celebrated nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite , weyl nodes in condensed matter materials , in fact ,",
    "always come in pairs of opposite chirality .",
    "in general , however , the nodes in each pair need not coincide .",
    "experimentally , the first three - dimensional dirac materials , i.e. , na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 , were discovered only a few years ago @xcite . since then a large number of weyl materials ( i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) were discovered as well @xcite .",
    "these discoveries opened a new chapter in studies of numerous effects associated with quantum anomalies and chirality by using simple table - top experiments , rather than accelerator techniques of high - energy physics .",
    "in addition to quantum field theoretical methods , there exist a number of very powerful semiclassical techniques for studying condensed matter systems such as weyl and dirac materials in external electromagnetic fields .",
    "one of them is the kinetic theory . because of the nontrivial topological properties of weyl fermions @xcite , the corresponding kinetic theory should account for the berry curvature effects @xcite .",
    "amazingly , the resulting chiral kinetic theory @xcite can reproduce even the effects due to the quantum chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "note that the latter implies the nonconservation of the chiral charge in the presence of parallel background electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the dirac and weyl materials make also possible the investigations of novel quantum phenomena that can not exist in high - energy physics . in particular",
    ", a number of such phenomena can be associated with the quasiparticle response to background pseudoelectromagnetic ( axial ) fields . unlike the ordinary electromagnetic fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , their pseudoelectromagnetic counterparts @xmath10 and @xmath11 couple to the left - handed and right - handed particles with opposite signs . indeed , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , such fields can be induced by mechanical strains in dirac and weyl materials .",
    "a pseudoelectric field @xmath12 , for instance , can be created by dynamically stretching or compressing the sample .",
    "a nonzero pseudomagnetic field @xmath13 is generated , e.g. , by applying a static torsion @xcite or bending the sample @xcite .",
    "a typical magnitude of the pseudomagnetic field @xmath14 is estimated to be about @xmath15 in the former case and about @xmath16 in the latter case .",
    "for the purposes of this study , it will be sufficient to consider only static deformations so that @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , we will also assume that the ordinary electric field is also absent @xmath18 .",
    "in this study we suggest that the strain - induced pseudomagnetic fields can be utilized for creating pseudomagnetic lenses for deflecting and focusing beams of weyl quasiparticles , depending on the particle chiralities .",
    "a general experimental setup that allows a maximum control of chiral beams is given by a combination of the magnetic and pseudomagnetic lenses as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] .",

    "( generically , the sample itself can be longer than @xmath21 . )",
    "the magnetic field is generated by an electric current in the solenoid and the pseudomagnetic one is produced by the torsion of the crystal .",
    "since the characteristic scales of spatial variations of the background magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields in the ( pseudo-)magnetic lens are much larger than the de broglie wavelengths of weyl quasiparticles , it is justified to use the eikonal approximation for the description of their motion . because of a nontrivial topology of chiral particles , we will pay a special attention to the berry curvature effects on the corresponding chiral rays .",

    "this regime seems to be relevant for applications in dirac semimetals such as cd@xmath0as@xmath1 when the effective background field is weaker than about @xmath141 . for stronger fields , or for other types of dirac / weyl materials",
    ", it is possible that the berry curvature could lead to substantial corrections in the quantitative description of the ( pseudo-)magnetic lenses .",
    "in fact , these corrections may lead to a spatial separation of the beams of chiral quasiparticles even by the ordinary magnetic field alone .",
    "in such a case , a more refined analysis using quantum , rather than semiclassical equations would be required .    in the framework of a simplified model with a spatially uniform ( pseudo-)magnetic field inside the lens , we derived the explicit general expressions for the principal foci and the focal length .",
    "the corresponding results include the effects due to the berry curvature and are reliable only in the case of not too strong background fields .",
    "in addition , in order to address the role of inhomogeneous fields , we also studied a simple model with a nonuniform pseudomagnetic field , see eq .",
    "( [ inhom - b - profile ] ) . in this case",
    ", we found that the effect of a highly nonuniform field is similar to that of a uniform one , but with the effective length of the lens @xmath142 given by eq .",
    "( [ inhom - b - leff ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in this study we solved the eikonal equation for weyl quasiparticles by using the paraxial approximation .",
    "clearly , this is adequate only when the beam of chiral quasiparticles remains close to the axis of the ( pseudo-)magnetic lens . in practice , of course , this condition may break down and , then , one would have to reanalyze the problem by using numerical methods .",
    "in such a regime , optical aberrations will appear and further complicate the situation . while all these issues may be of real importance for making pseudomagnetic lenses in practice , they are beyond the scope of the conceptual study presented here",
    ".    it is intriguing to suggest that the pseudomagnetic lenses could allow for new and powerful ways of controlling and manipulating the chiral beams of quasiparticles inside dirac and weyl materials .",
    "for example , they may open an experimental possibility to control the spatial distributions of the electric current densities due to weyl quasiparticles , depending on their chirality . by focusing the beams of the left- and right - handed quasiparticles in different spatial regions",
    ", one could achieve a  chiral distillation \" and/or steady states of matter with a nonzero chiral asymmetry .",
    "this could allow various new applications that utilize the possibility of a _ chiral spectrometer _ , in which spatial separation of chiral charges may be detected via the local probes .",
