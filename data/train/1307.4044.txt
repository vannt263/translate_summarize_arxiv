    "meson decays provide an important tool for exploring the structures of these simplest bound states in qcd , and for studies on non - perturbative behavior of strong interactions .",
    "these studies has become a hot topic in recent years .",
    "flavourless vector mesons play an important role in hadron physics due to their direct coupling to photons and thus provide an invaluable insight into the phenomenology of electromagnetic couplings to hadrons .",
    "thus , a realistic description of vector mesons at the quark level of compositeness would be an important element in our understanding of hadron dynamics and reaction processes at scales where qcd degrees of freedom are relevant .",
    "there have been a number of studies@xcite on processes involving strong , radiative and leptonic decays of vector mesons .",
    "such studies offer a direct probe of hadron structure and help in revealing some aspects of the underlying quark - gluon dynamics .    in this work",
    "we study electromagnetic decays of ground state equal mass vector mesons : @xmath10 and @xmath4 ( each comprising of equal mass quarks ) through the process @xmath11 which proceeds through the coupling of quark - anti quark loop to the electromagnetic current in the framework of bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , which is a conventional non - perturbative approach in dealing with relativistic bound state problems in qcd and is firmly established in the framework of field theory . from the solutions ,",
    "we obtain useful information about the inner structure of hadrons which is also crucial in high energy hadronic scattering and production processes . despite its drawback of having to input model dependent kernel ,",
    "these studies have become an interesting topic in recent years since calculations have satisfactory results as more and more data is being accumulated .",
    "we get useful insight about the treatment of various processes using bse due to the unambiguous definition of the 4d bs wave function which provides exact effective coupling vertex ( hadron - quark vertex ) of the hadron with all its constituents ( quarks ) .",
    "we have employed qcd motivated bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) under covariant instantaneous ansatz ( cia)@xcite to calculate this process .",
    "cia is a lorentz - invariant generalization of instantaneous ansatz ( ia ) .",
    "what distinguishes cia from other 3d reductions of bse is its capacity for a two - way interconnection : an exact 3d bse reduction for a @xmath12 system ( for calculation of mass spectrum ) , and an equally exact reconstruction of original 4d bse ( for calculation of transition amplitudes as 4d quark loop integrals ) . in these studies ,",
    "the main ingredient is the 4d hadron - quark vertex function @xmath6 which plays the role of an exact effective coupling vertex of the hadron with all its constituents ( quarks ) .",
    "the complete 4d bs wave function @xmath13 for a hadron of momentum @xmath14 and internal momentum @xmath15 comprises of the two quark propagators ( corresponding to two constituent quarks ) bounding the hadron - quark vertex @xmath6 .",
    "this 4d bs wave function is considered to sum up all the non - perturbative qcd effects in the hadron .",
    "now one of the main ingredients in 4d bs wave function ( bsw ) is its dirac structure .",
    "the copius dirac structure of bsw was already studied by c.h.l .",
    "smith@xcite much earlier .",
    "recent studies@xcite have revealed that various mesons have many different dirac structures in their bs wave functions , whose inclusion is necessary to obtain quantitatively accurate observables .",
    "it was further noticed that all structures do not contribute equally for calculation of various meson observables@xcite .",
    "further , it was amply noted in @xcite that many hadronic processes are particularly sensitive to higher order dirac structures in bs amplitudes . it was further noted in @xcite that inclusion of higher order dirac structures is also important to obtain simultaneous agreement with experimental decay widths for a range of processes such as : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc . for a given choice of parameters .    towards this end , to ensure a systematic procedure of incorporating various dirac covariants from their complete set in the bsws of various hadrons ( pseudoscalar , vector etc . ) , we developed a naive power counting rule in ref.@xcite , by which we incorporate various dirac structures in bsw , order - by - order in powers of inverse of meson mass . using this power counting rule we calculated electromagnetic decay constants of vector mesons ( @xmath19 ) using only the leading order ( lo ) dirac structures [ @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "however in ref.@xcite , we rigorously studied leptonic decays of unequal mass pseudoscalar mesons @xmath22 and calculated the leptonic decay constants @xmath23 for these mesons employing both the leading order ( lo ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) dirac structures .",
    "the contributions of both lo and nlo dirac structures to @xmath23 was worked out .",
    "we further studied the relevance of both the lo and the nlo dirac structures to this calculation . in the present paper , we extended these studies to vector mesons and have employed both lo and nlo dirac structures identified according to our power counting rule , to calculate @xmath24 for ground state vector mesons , @xmath25 and in the process we studied the relevance of various dirac structures to calculation of decay constants @xmath24 for vector mesons in the process @xmath16 .",
    "we found that contributions from nlo dirac structures are smaller than those of lo dirac structures for all vector mesons . in",
    "what follows , we give a detailed discussion of the fit and calculation up to nlo level after a brief review of our framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we discuss the structure of bsw for vector mesons under cia using the power counting rule we proposed earlier . in section 3",
    "we give the calculation of @xmath24 for vector mesons . a detailed presentation of results and",
    "the numerical calculation is given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is relegated to discussion .",
    "we briefly outline the bse framework under cia . for simplicity , lets consider a @xmath26 system comprising of scalar quarks with an effective kernel @xmath27 , 4d wave function @xmath28 , and with the 4d bse , @xmath29 where @xmath30are the inverse propagators , and @xmath31 are ( effective ) constituent masses of quarks .",
    "the 4-momenta of the quark and anti - quark , @xmath32 , are related to the internal 4-momentum @xmath33 and total momentum @xmath34 of hadron of mass @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37/2 $ ] are the wightman - garding ( wg ) definitions of masses of individual quarks .",
    "now it is convenient to express the internal momentum of the hadron @xmath15 as the sum of two parts , the transverse component , @xmath38 which is orthogonal to total hadron momentum @xmath14 ( ie . @xmath39 regardless of whether the individual quarks are on - shell or off - shell ) , and the longitudinal component , @xmath40 , which is parallel to p. thus we can decompose @xmath33 as , @xmath41 , where the transverse component , @xmath42 is an effective 3d vector , while the longitudinal component , @xmath43 plays the role of the fourth component and is like the time component . to obtain the 3d bse and the hadron - quark vertex , use an ansatz on the bs kernel @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) which is assumed to depend on the 3d variables @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    "@xcite i.e. @xmath46 hence , the longitudinal component , @xmath47 of @xmath33 , does not appear in the form @xmath48 of the kernel .",
    "defining @xmath49 as the 3d wave function , @xmath50 integrating eq.(1 ) , and making use of eqs.(2 - 3 ) , we obtain the 3d salpeter equation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the 3d denominator function defined as @xcite , @xmath53 whose value given above is obtained by evaluating the contour integration over inverse quark propagators in the complex @xmath54-plane by noting their corresponding pole positions ( for details see@xcite ) . which is used for making contact with mass spectra of @xmath12 mesons .",
    "further , making use of eq.(2 ) and ( 3 ) on rhs of eq.(1 ) , we get , @xmath55 from equality of rhs of eq.(4 ) and ( 6 ) , we see that an exact interconnection between 3d and 4d bs wave functions is thus brought out .",
    "the 4d hadron - quark vertex function for scalar quarks under cia can be identified as : @xmath56    now for fermionic quarks , the 4d bse under gluonic which is akin to vector type interaction kernel with a 3d support can be written as : @xmath57    here , @xmath58 is the color factor , @xmath59 and the potential @xmath60 involves the scalar structure of the gluon propagator in the perturbative ( o.g.e . ) as well as the non - perturbative ( confinement ) regimes .",
    "the full structure of @xmath60 is @xcite :    @xmath61    which is taken as one - gluon - exchange like as regards color [ @xmath62 and spin ( @xmath63 ) dependence .",
    "the scalar function @xmath64 is a sum of one - gluon exchange @xmath65 and a confining term @xmath66 .",
    "this confining term simulates an effect of an almost linear confinement ( @xmath67 ) for heavy quark ( @xmath68 ) sector , while retaining harmonic form ( @xmath69 ) for light quark ( @xmath70 ) sector as is believed to be true for qcd .",
    "@xmath71 the values of basic constants are : @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 gev , @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev and @xmath77 gev @xcite .",
    "however the form of bse in eq.(8 ) is not convenient to use in practice since dirac matrices lead to several coupled integral equations .",
    "however a considerable simplification is effected by expressing them in gordon - reduced form which is permissible on the mass shells of quarks ( ie . on the surface @xmath78 ) .",
    "the gordon reduced bse form of the fermionic bse can be written as @xcite : @xmath79 where the connection between @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( whose structure is identical as @xmath81 in case of scalar quarks in eq.(1 ) ) is , @xmath82    now to reduce the above bse to the 3d form , all time - like components @xmath83 of momenta in @xmath84 on rhs of eq.(9 ) are replaced by their on - shell values giving us the 3d form , @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath86    the 3d form of bse then works out as @xcite : @xmath87 this is reducible to the equation for a 3d harmonic oscillator with coefficients depending on the mass @xmath35 and total quantum number @xmath88 .",
    "the ground state wave functions @xcite deducible from this equation have gaussian structure and are expressed as : @xmath89 and is appropriate for making contact with o(3)-like mass spectrum ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that this 3d bse ( in eq.(14 ) ) which is responsible for determination of mass spectra of mesons in cia is formally equivalent ( see @xcite ) to the corresponding mass spectral equation deduced earlier using null - plane approximation ( npa)@xcite .",
    "thus the mass spectral predications for @xmath90 systems in bse under cia are identical to the corresponding mass spectral predictions for these systems in bse under npa @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we further wish to mention that a similar form for ground state wave function in harmonic oscillator basis using variational arguments has been used in @xcite . in ground state wave function @xmath91 in eq.(15 ) , @xmath92 is the inverse range parameter which incorporates the content of bs dynamics and is dependent on the input kernel @xmath93 ( for details see @xcite ) the structure of inverse range parameter @xmath92 in wave functions @xmath91 is given as @xcite : @xmath94      thus , for fermionic quarks , the full 4d bs wave function can be written as    @xmath95    where the 4d hadron - quark vertex function is @xcite",
    "i.e. @xmath96 the 4d hadron - quark vertex @xmath6 in the above equation , satisfies a 4d bse with a natural off - shell extension over the entire 4d space ( due to the positive definiteness of the quantity @xmath97 throughout the entire 4d space ) and thus provides a fully lorentz - invariant basis for evaluation of various transition amplitudes through various quark loop diagrams .",
    "@xmath98 in the above equation is the 4d bs normalizer .    in the hadron - quark vertex function , @xmath6 above , ( @xmath99 ) contains the relevant dirac structures @xcite which makes @xmath6 a @xmath100 matrix in the spinor space . in our model ,",
    "the relevant dirac structures in @xmath6 are incorporated in accordance with our recently proposed power counting rule @xcite which identifies the leading order ( lo ) dirac structures from the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) dirac structures and for a vector meson is expressed as : @xmath101\\frac{a_2}{m}\\\\ & & \\nonumber+i\\frac{a_3}{m^2}[(\\gamma\\cdot\\varepsilon)(\\gamma\\cdot p)(\\gamma\\cdot q ) - ( \\gamma\\cdot\\varepsilon)(\\gamma\\cdot q)(\\gamma\\cdot p)+2i(q\\cdot\\varepsilon)(\\gamma\\cdot p)]\\\\ & & + ( q\\cdot\\varepsilon)\\frac{a_4}{m}+i(q\\cdot\\varepsilon)(\\gamma\\cdot p)\\frac{a_5}{m^2 } - i(q\\cdot\\varepsilon)(\\gamma\\cdot q)\\frac{a_6}{m^2 } + ( q\\cdot\\varepsilon)[(\\gamma\\cdot p)(\\gamma\\cdot q)-(\\gamma\\cdot q)(\\gamma\\cdot p)]\\frac{a_7}{m^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 are taken as the eight dimensionless constant coefficients to be determined .",
    "but since we take constituent quark masses , where the quark mass , @xmath35 is approximately half the hadron mass , @xmath35 , we can use the ansatz , @xmath103 in the rest frame of the hadron .",
    "then each of the eight terms in the above equation receives suppression by different powers of @xmath104 .",
    "thus we can arrange these terms as an expansion in powers of @xmath105 .",
    "we can then see that in the expansion of @xmath106 that the structures associated with the coefficients , @xmath107 have magnitudes , @xmath108 and are of leading order ( lo ) .",
    "those with @xmath109 are @xmath110 and are next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , while those with @xmath111 are @xmath112 and are nnlo .",
    "this naive power counting rule suggests that the maximum contribution to calculation of any vector meson observable should come from dirac structures @xmath113 and @xmath114 associated with coefficients , @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively , followed by the higher order dirac structures associated with the other four coefficients , @xmath117 and then by dirac structures associated with coefficients , @xmath111 .",
    "in this work we try to calculate the decay constants using lo and nlo dirac structures since we wish to calculate the decay constants up to next - to - leading orders .",

    "this power counting rule suggests that the maximum contribution to any meson observable should come from dirac structures associated with leading order ( lo ) terms alone , followed by dirac structures associated with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) terms in the vertex function .",
    "incorporation of all these covariants is found to bring calculated @xmath136 values much closer to results of experimental data @xcite and some recent calculations @xcite for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "the @xmath136 predicted are within the error bars of experimental data for each one of these five mesons .",
    "the results for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons with parameter set : @xmath239 ,",
    "@xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 ( giving @xmath136 values with average error with respect to experimental data of 4% ) are presented in table 2 .",
    "comparison with experimental data and other models is shown in table 2 .    in fig .",
    "3 we are plotting vs @xmath230 the integrands of @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath136 for each of studied mesons .",
    "those plots show that the contribution to @xmath136 from nlo covariants is smaller than the contribution from lo covariants for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons . and for @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , nlo contribution is negligible in comparison to lo contribution .",
    "then , it is concluded from table 2 that as far as the various contributions to decay constants @xmath136 are concerned , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , the lo terms contribute only  55% , while nlo terms  45% .",
    "however as one goes to @xmath2 meson , the lo contribution increases to  62.8% , while nlo contribution is 37.2% . but",
    "as one goes to heavy ( @xmath247 and @xmath248 ) mesons , for @xmath3 meson , lo contribution is 84.8% , while nlo contribution is 15.2% , and for @xmath4 meson the lo contribution is 92.6% , while nlo contribution reduces to just 7.4% .",
    "thus the drop in contribution to decay constants from nlo covariants vis - a - vis lo covariants is more pronounced for heavy mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 . and among the two lo covariants , it can be seen that the most leading covariant @xmath249 contributes the maximum for all vector mesons from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "these results on decay constants @xmath24 for vector mesons are completely in conformity with the corresponding results on decay constants @xmath23 for pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath250 and @xmath251 done recently@xcite where it was also noticed that the nlo contribution is much smaller than the lo contribution for hevier mesons like @xmath252 and @xmath251 , where the contribution drops from 10% to 4% , and the most leading covariant was found to be @xmath253 .",
    "this is in conformity with the power counting rule according to which the leading order covariants , @xmath254 and @xmath255 ( associated with coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) should contribute maximum to decay constants followed by the next - to - leading order covariants , @xmath256 and @xmath257(1/m^2)$ ] ( associated with coefficients @xmath258 and @xmath194 ) in the bs wave function .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "2 that though lo and nlo dirac covariants are sufficient to correctly predict amplitudes for @xmath2 and @xmath259 vector mesons , but only lo covariants are sufficient for @xmath4 meson .",
    "but for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , the lo and nlo dirac covariants are not sufficient to predict accurately their amplitudes and is thus necessary to include even higher order nnlo dirac covariants in their hadron - quark vertex functions .",
    "this can also be seen from fig .",
    "however , the numerical results for @xmath136 for equal mass vector mesons , obtained in our framework with use of leading order dirac covariants along with the next to leading order dirac covariants , along with a similar calculation for @xmath23 done recently @xcite for pseudoscalar mesons demonstrates the validity of our power counting rule , which also provides a practical means of incorporating various dirac covariants in the bs wave function of a hadron . by this rule",
    ", we also get to understand the relative importance of various covariants to calculation of meson observables",
    ". this would in turn help in obtaining a better understanding of the hadron structure .",
