    "the advanced technology solar telescope ( atst , @xcite @xcite ) , with its 4-meter aperture , will be the largest solar telescope in the world .",
    "a suite of advanced instrumentation will allow for unprecedented resolution and precision imaging , spectroscopy and polarimetry at visible and infrared wavelengths . in order to address the most challenging problems in modern solar physics , atst s",
    "highest priorities are oriented towards high - resolution and coronal science .",
    "obviously , these are aspects in which the site selection will have a strong impact and therefore should be considered very carefully in the decision of the telescope location .",
    "the atst site survey working group ( sswg ) was created in 2000 with an open call to the international community .",
    "its goal was essentially to test the best solar observatories in the world and produce a recommendation to maximize the scientific capabilities of the atst .",
    "more especifically , a set of quantitative goals were set for the atst site :    * clear time of 70% , or 3000 annual hours of sunshine . * 1800 annual hours of seeing with a fried parameter @xmath1 better than 7 cm , including at least 100 continuous 2-hour blocks . * 200 annual hours of @xmath2  cm , including at least 10 continuous 2-hour blocks . * large isoplanatic angle for adequate performance of the adaptive optics system over a large field of view .",
    "this goal is equivalent to demanding minimal turbulence at high altitude . * 480 annual hours with a sky brightness smaller than 25 millionths of the disk value at a distance of 1.1 solar radii .",
    "the radial profile curve should follow a power law with an exponent @xmath3 or steeper .",
    "these conditions should be met in at least 40 continuous 4-hour block per year .",
    "* 600 annual hours with precipitable water vapor below 5  mm , including at least 40 continuous 4-hour blocks .",
    "only two comparative studies of solar observatories had been conducted prior to this work .",
    "the joso organization studied nearly 40 sites in europe to conclude that observatorio del teide in tenerife ( canary islands ) provided the better conditions recorded in their data ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the other work is that of the caltech survey , which considered 34 sites in the southern california area to locate what is now the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "initially , a list of 72 well - established observatories and some promising undeveloped sites was compiled . since the atst sswg had only sufficient resources for extensive testing of up to six sites , a first decision had to be made in the absence of any actual measurements .",
    "this decision was made based on previous observing experience of the group members .",
    "a first round of discussion quickly resulted in the selection of bbso , la palma ( canary islands ) and sacramento peak ( new mexico ) , which have an outstanding record in producing high - quality solar observations .",
    "the sswg also selected hawaii , and in particular haleakala ( on the island of maui ) was preferred over mauna loa and mauna kea after taking feasibility issues into account .",
    "diverse other considerations later resulted in the choice of panguitch lake ( utah ) and san pedro m ' artir ( mexico ) for the final two slots .",
    "the instrumentation deployed at the six candidate sites includes a scintillometer array ( shabar ) and a solar differential image motion monitor ( s - dimm ) .",
    "both instruments have been described in a recent paper by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shabar and s - dimm are used to determine the atmospheric turbulence as a function of height .",
    "it must be noted that daytime seeing conditions are often strongly dependent on height above the ground .",
    "thus , the atst site survey needed to determine the observing conditions at the telescope aperture height , approximately 35  meters above the ground ( the actual height is still to be decided ) .",
    "the site survey instrumentation was placed at a height of 8  meters ( 6-meter stand plus a 2-meter telescope pier ) , which is high enough to avoid the lower part of the surface boundary layer but not so high that wind jitter could become a significant problem .",
    "data from the shabar and s - dimm instruments have been gathered and analyzed until august 2004 . in october 2004 ,",
    "the atst sswg presented a final recommendation and produced an exhaustive document with a detailed report of the site survey process .",
    "the sswg report is publicly available for download from the atst website ( http://atst.nso.edu/ ) .",
    "that document contains abundant technical documentation and the reader is referred to it for further details .",
    "the present series of papers is a formal publication of the most relevant results .",
    "this first paper describes the inversion methods used to infer the atmospheric turbulence and the fried parameter from the shabar / s - dimm data .",
    "the methods have been extensively tested by means of simulations , comparison between different algorithms and also with _ in situ _ measurements .",
    "one month of data ( may 2003 ) was used for testing and fine tuning the algorithms before being applied systematically to the entire site survey period .",
    "the final objective is to determine the fried parameter as a function of height , @xmath5 .",
    "this parameter depends not only on the turbulence at a height @xmath6 but also everything above it . with some assumptions",
    "( see @xcite @xcite for a complete derivation ) , @xmath1 can be obtained as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant , @xmath9 is the zenith angle and @xmath10 ( which represents the amplitude of the refraction index fluctuations ) characterizes the local atmospheric turbulence at height @xmath6 .",
    "notice that @xmath6 denotes height above the instrument , which in our case is located 8 meters above the ground .",
    "the covariances ( @xmath11 ) of the brigthness fluctuations measured by two detectors , separated by a distance @xmath12 in the shabar array , are related to @xmath10 by : @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are known functions with analytical expressions .",
    "if @xmath15 is the detector diameter and @xmath16 is twice the tangent of the solar radius ( which we consider approximately constant though the year ) : @xmath17 ^ 2 j_0(2\\pi f s ) f^{-2/3 } df \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the bessel functions .",
    "the total scintillation can be obtained from the expressions above as @xmath20 .",
    "the kernels @xmath14 are shown in fig  [ fig : kernels ] .",
    "it can be deduced from this figure that the @xmath11 corresponding to further separations ( larger values of @xmath12 ) have their sensitivity peak at higher atmospheric layers .",
    "fig  [ fig : bis ] shows average values of @xmath21 measured at the six candidate sites .",
    "not surprisingly , the covariances decrease with the detector separation @xmath12 .",
    "the inversion strategy that we employed to solve for @xmath22 in eq  ( [ eqbi ] ) is a non - linear least - squares iterative fitting combined with singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the covariance matrix .",
    "the details of the implementation can be found , e.g. in @xcite ( @xcite ) , but the basic idea is the following .",
    "one starts with an initial guess for the @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 are the gridpoints of the atmospheric discretization ) . with this initial model",
    "we calculate the 15 different covariances @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the separation between each pair of detectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the shabar instrument ) , the total scintillation @xmath20 and the fried parameter at the base of the atmosphere @xmath29 ( measured by the s - dimm instrument ) , using eqs  ( [ eqr0 ] ) and  ( [ eqbi ] ) .",
    "the derivatives of these parameters with respect to the @xmath22 ( the so - called response functions ) are also computed , as this information is needed by the fitting procedure .",
    "the synthetic @xmath11 and @xmath1 are then compared to those actually measured by the shabar and s - dimm . in general",
    ", the synthetic values will not match the measurements .",
    "the algorithm then uses the information in the response functions to calculate the first - order corrections @xmath30 that minimize the difference ( in a least - squares sense ) between the synthetic and measured values of @xmath21 and @xmath29 .    the numerical solution of an inverse problem such as the one described here is always challenging , but even more is to ensure that the results obtained are physically meaningful .",
    "understanding the issues and uncertainties involved in the inversion is critical for the success of the site survey and , ultimately , the atst .",
    "it is equally important to ensure that the numerical codes employed are exhaustively tested and debugged .",
    "based on previous experience with conceptually similar problems , the sswg decided that two different codes should be independently developed and applied to the data .",
    "the two codes , based on the same minimization scheme described above , exhibit some differences in the actual implementation . by comparing the results provided by two different codes",
    ", we can learn about the reliability of the procedure and the limitations of our seeing measurements . since there is no reason to prefer one above the other , we take the difference between their respective results as an estimate of the error bar .",
    "the first code was developed at the instituto de astrof ' isica de canarias ( iac ) and run by national solar observatory ( nso ) staff .",
    "the spatial grid is equispaced in @xmath31 with 68 points ranging from 20  cm to 40  km .",
    "however , not all of these points are inverted for ( the problem would be ill - posed due to the large number of free parameters ) .",
    "instead , @xmath22 is determined at a subset of 17 special locations , the so - called inversion nodes .",
    "the rest of the atmosphere is then reconstructed via splines interpolation from the values at the nodes .    in order to ensure that @xmath22 is always positive",
    ", we used the following change of variable .",
    "the code solves for a variable @xmath32 such that @xmath33 $ ] . in this manner , regardless of whether @xmath32 is positive or negative , @xmath22 will always be positive . before inverting ,",
    "the measured @xmath11 and @xmath29 are processed with a 5-minute running median filter to smooth out fluctuations due to instrumental issues or problems such as birds or insects flying by the detectors .",
    "after an initial application of the code to a sample dataset , it was found that a significant number of points could not be successfully fitted by the procedure .",
    "the observed @xmath29 provided by the s - dimm instrument was inconsistent with the observed scintillation values @xmath21 from the shabar . in all cases",
    "the s - dimm @xmath1 was smaller than would be expected from the scintillation measurements . to overcome this difficulty we introduced an additional parameter @xmath34 in the inversion that accounts for this `` missing scintillation '' , so that the synthetic @xmath11 are now given by : @xmath35 while eq  ( [ eqr0 ] ) is still used to compute @xmath5 .",
    "the necessity to include @xmath34 points towards the existence of a a source of image degradation that does not produce scintillation .",
    "this may be due to a finite outer turbulence scale , to `` windfiltering '' ( due to the finite time amount it takes for the turbulence to cross the field - of - view at high altitudes ) or to high - altitude seeing ( higher than @xmath01  km , where the kernels converge ) . in either case",
    ", the inclusion of @xmath34 would be appropriate .",
    "while we have not been able to pinpoint the exact nature of the missing scintillation , the statistical distribution of @xmath34 ( see fig  [ fig : deltas ] ) provides an interesting clue .    the two island sites ( la palma and haleakala ) require a relatively small amount of missing scintillation , whereas the lake site ( big bear ) frequently demands a substantially larger value .",
    "as we discuss below , the seeing in the island sites is typically dominated by a boundary layer near the ground and the turbulence decreases rapidly as we move upwards . the lake sites , on the other hand , are frequently dominated by high - altitude seeing .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the @xmath34 is related to the turbulence above the sensitivity range of the shabar .",
    "the second inversion code was developed independently at the high altitude observatory ( hao ) .",
    "one of the essential differences with the iac code is that all the grid - points in the atmospheric discretization are now free parameters . in order to make the algorithm stable ,",
    "a regularization scheme was implemented in such a way that the code prefers smooth solutions whenever possible .",
    "basically , in each iteration we add a penalization term to the @xmath36 .",
    "this term is proportional to the quadratic deviation of @xmath22 from a straight line on a @xmath37-@xmath37 plot .",
    "the fact that each grid - point is a free parameter represents an important burden that slows down the execution of the code .",
    "this is compensated , to some extent , by the more accurate integration scheme described below .",
    "the model atmosphere only goes up to a maximum height @xmath38 where the inversion kernels merge ( fig  [ fig : kernels ] ) .",
    "we still consider the effect of turbulence above @xmath39 by breaking down the integrals as : @xmath40 and @xmath41 note that @xmath42 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "as before , @xmath16 and @xmath42 are free parameters that account for the scintillation and image degradation coming from high - altitude turbulence .",
    "another important difference with the iac code is the integration scheme used to solve eqs  ( [ eqbi2 ] ) and  ( [ eqr02 ] ) .",
    "the integral over each finite grid interval is computed assuming a parabolic dependence of @xmath43 with @xmath31 ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "while this integration introduces some additional complexity in the algorithm , it also alleviates the computational expense of the inversions by allowing a coarser grid without loss of accuracy .",
    "the data pre - processing includes a 5-minute block average and a test to look for clouds in the averaged interval . if the derivative of the intensity measured by the shabar detectors changes sign two or more times , the entire period is flagged as cloudy and the @xmath5 is set to zero at all heights .",
    "a sample subset of data ( those taken in may 2003 ) were subject to inversion with both codes .",
    "fig  [ fig : testcomp1 ] shows the cumulative distributions produced by each code at la palma , haleakala and big bear .",
    "the results are fairly similar for most of the height range represented in the figure .",
    "as one would expect , the discrepancy increases with height due to the limited sensitivity of the shabar measurements to turbulence at higher layers .",
    "the same behavior is observed with the in situ measurements ( see section  [ sec : insitu ] below ) .",
    "a more detailed representation is given in figs  [ fig : testcomp2 ] and  [ fig : testcomp3 ] , which show the average stratifications of @xmath10 and @xmath1 with height .",
    "the @xmath10 produced by the hao code has more spatial structure ( small - scale fluctuations ) than the iac code .",
    "however , the overall dependence is actually very similar and the iac results resemble a smoothed - out version of those from hao ( at least down to the first meter above the detectors ) . whether the fine structure inferred by the hao code is real or not is practically irrelevant for our purposes here , as the @xmath5 parameter , which is our ultimate goal , is barely sensitive to it .",
    "the @xmath1 stratifications from both codes are very similar , at least up to @xmath0  40  m above the instrument . in this small sample",
    "we can already see the different behavior of the lake sites ( big bear and panguitch ) as opposed to the island ( la palma and haleakala ) and continental sites ( san pedro m ' artir and sac peak ) .",
    "the big bear plot exhibits a larger @xmath1 near the ground , but it does not improve significantly with height .",
    "the island and continental sites , on the other hand , have a lower value at the ground but the seeing improves dramatically as we go to higher layers , suggesting the presence of a boundary layer near the ground .",
    "the slope is particularly steep in the @xmath030 - 40  m range , precisely where the atst aperture will be .",
    "these results emphasize the importance of analyzing the height dependence of @xmath1 , as we have done in this work , since the site and height of the telescope may end up being critical factors in the performance of the atst .",
    "perhaps the most reliable test of the atst site survey analysis is to compare its results directly with actual in situ measurements .",
    "the sswg had access to a tower with meteorological instrumentation including hygrometers and sonic anemometers at various heights ( dash , @xcite @xcite ) . with this instrumentation",
    "it is possible to make local measurements of temperature @xmath44 and humidity @xmath45 up to a height of @xmath0100  m. these parameters are monitored at a rate of 30  hz , from which @xmath10 can be derived .    a complete shabar / s - dimm system was deployed in erie ( colorado ) , at the base of the measuring tower .",
    "simultaneous measurements from the tower and the atst instrumentation have been used to produce the scatter plots in fig  [ fig : erie ] .",
    "each panel shows the diagonal of the plot , as well as the pearson correlation between the atst inversions and the shabar instrumentation . before analyzing the discrepancies between the two ,",
    "a brief explanation is in order . while the tower measurements are strictly local , the shabar detectors receive solar light that has passed through a cone of earth atmosphere .",
    "thus , the atst instrumentation is sensitive to a field of view that becomes larger for higher heights . for this reason ,",
    "the @xmath10 measured in situ is expected to exhibit larger temporal fluctuations than that from the atst instrumentation , which is a spatial average over the shabar field of view .",
    "this effect , which can be seen in fig  [ fig : erie2 ] , increases the scatter especially in the higher layers .",
    "moreover , the shabar field of view is displaced with respect to the tower instrumentation by an amount that increases with height . in any case",
    ", fig  [ fig : erie2 ] shows that the overall trends are in general well retrieved by the atst analysis .",
    "the tests indicate good agreement between both types of measurements up to a height between 22 and 50  m. it is important to note that the height range where the atst measurements are accurate is lower in this case than at the actual candidate sites , simply because the tests were carried out during mid - winter at the considerably higher latitude of erie ( the @xmath46 $ ] angle was always larger than 2.0 ) .",
    "while the erie tests reassured our confidence in the atst seeing measurements , there was still some concern that the atmospheric structure above the continental colorado is probably very different from the actual sites .",
    "the sswg then decided to mount similar in - situ probes on a portable crane to perform similar tests on big bear and haleakala .",
    "new measurements ( this time considering lower heights due to the limitations of the crane ) were conducted at the two sites , with the results shown in fig  [ fig : tests2 ] .",
    "the haleakala tests show excellent agreement between the inversions and the measurements . in big bear",
    ", however , the correlation is very weak . among the differences between the two sites",
    "are the level of humidity , the local topography and environment , and the probable lack of a ground boundary layer in big bear",
    ".    a possible explanation may be that the weaker scintillation in big bear makes these measurements more sensitive to noise . a closer look at the data shows that the correlation is improved by removing outlier points and clouds ( fig  [ fig : bbtest1 ] ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the dataset gathered on may 12 2004 , which reveals the dependence of the data with the wind direction ( fig  [ fig : bbtest2 ] ) .",
    "when the wind blows from the lake ( west ) , the observing conditions are optimal and the seeing is dominated by high - altitude turbulence . on that particular day",
    "the wind changed from west to variable directions , resulting in the development of a ground turbulence layer and improving the correlation coefficient to @xmath00.77 .",
    "note also that , in the absence of a surface turbulence layer at big bear , @xmath1 will essentially be independent of @xmath6 near the ground and the s - dimm measurements at 8  m can be taken to represent @xmath1 at 25 - 40  m.",
    "the atst project has imposed stringent requirements on the telescope site , both in terms of seeing and sky brightness .",
    "the seeing analysis has proven very challenging due to the strong dependence of @xmath1 with height exhibited by most sites .",
    "this paper describes the analysis employed by the atst sswg to find the site that provides optimal conditions ( @xmath1 ) at the height of the atst primary aperture .",
    "various tests have been used to demonstrate the validity of our analysis , at least up to @xmath040  m above the ground .",
    "the use of two independent inversion codes are helpful to understand the uncertainties in the procedure and to set error bars on the measurements . moreover , in situ measurements proved the validity of the approach in the height range of interest .",
    "the only caveat identified by our work is that the errors increase when the seeing is dominated by high - altitude turbulence ( i.e. , in the absence of a ground boundary layer ) .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "if we approximate @xmath32 and @xmath49 as parabolic functions of @xmath50 : @xmath51 we can solve analytically the integral in eq  ( [ eqbi2 ] ) between two adjacent grid - points @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as :                  , s.  l. , rimmele , t. , keller , c.  u. , hill , f. , radick , r.  r. , oschmann , j.  m. , warner , m. , dalrymple , n.  e. , briggs , j. , hegwer , s.  l. , & ren , d. 2003 , in innovative telescopes and instrumentation for solar astrophysics .",
