    "in recent years , we have been interested in studying joint polarization correlations of fundamental processes in qed and in the electro - weak theory@xcite for initially _ polarized _ and _ unpolarized _ particles .",
    "our main conclusion , based on explicit computations in quantum field theory , is that the mere fact that particles emerging from a process have non - zero speeds to reach detectors implies , in general , that their spin polarizations correlations probabilities _ depend on speed _ @xcite and _ may also depend on the underlying couplings _ @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions of polarization correlations , follow from these _ dynamical _ computations and are non - speculative involving no arbitrary input assumptions , and are seen to depend on speed , and may depend on the couplings as well . these are unlike nave considerations of simply combining the spins of the particles in question which are of kinematical nature , in general , not applicable to relativistic particles , and formal arguments based on combining spins only , as is often done , completely fail . in the limit of low energies , our earlier expressions @xcite for the polarization correlations were shown to be reduced to the nave ones just mentioned by simply combining spins . in our earlier investigation",
    "@xcite in the electro - weak theory in a process for the creation of a @xmath1 pair , from @xmath0 scattering , for example it was noted that due to the threshold needed to create such a pair the zero energy limit may not be taken and the study of polarization correlations by simply combining spins , without recourse to quantum field theory , has no meaning .",
    "our interest in this paper is the derivation of the _ explicit _ polarization correlation probabilities in elastic @xmath0 scattering in qed for initially _ polarized _ as well as _",
    "unpolarized _ particles , with emphasis put on the _ energy _ available in the process so that a detailed study can be carried out in the relativistic regime as well .",
    "the reasons for our present investigation are two fold .",
    "first several experiments on @xmath2 have been carried out over the years @xcite , and it is expected that our explicit new expression for the polarization correlations obtained , depending on speeds , may lead to new experiments on polarization correlations which monitor the speed of the underlying particles .",
    "second , such a study may be relevant to experiments in the light of bell s theorem ( monitoring speed ) as discussed below .",
