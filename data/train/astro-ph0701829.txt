    "the importance of luminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter lirgs ) as the sites of the most extreme local star formation events ( @xcite ) makes them the best available templates for similar events in the distant universe .",
    "moreover their compact co - emitting regions ( @xcite ) makes them ideal for multi - line studies of their global molecular gas reservoir up to very high frequencies ( where the high - excitation molecular lines lie ) since the resulting narrow beams of today s single dish radio telescopes can still measure their total line fluxes with single pointings .",
    "our sensitive co j=21 , 32 , 43 , 65 , @xmath1co j=21 and hcn j=32 and 43 line observations with the jcmt and the iram 30-m telescope for @xmath9 lirgs , combined with available co and hcn j=10 data from the literature , will allow for excellent new constraints on the state of their global molecular gas reservoirs .",
    "more specifically the high - j co and the three hcn transitions can probe the excitation and mass of the dense ( @xmath10 ) gas , considered as the immediate fuel of their prodigious star formation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the completion of our co j=43 and j=65 observations and follow - up observations of still higher rotational co , @xmath11co and hcn transitions with _ herschel _ will ultimately allow the deduction of robust sleds for the star - forming molecular gas of lirgs in the local universe .",
    "these can then be used to uncover any universal aspects of the star - formation / molecular gas interplay in galaxies and find the best rest - frame mm / sub - mm lines for detecting and imaging the numerous lirgs that will be found at high redshifts in future deep mm / sub - mm continuum surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "+    the rotational transitions of the hcn and hco@xmath4 molecules with their high dipole moments are currently the best ( i.e. most luminous ) dense gas tracers in lirgs .",
    "an hcn j=10 line survey of such galaxies ( @xcite ) has even revealed a potentially constant star formation efficiency ( @xmath12 ) for molecular gas at densities @xmath13 , attributed to such a gas phase being the direct fuel of star formation in molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies have inserted some doubt as to whether hcn lines are good tracers of such a gas phase and suggested those of hco@xmath4 instead ( @xcite ) .",
    "our survey reveals a large range of hcn line excitation in lirgs with otherwise similar ir , co and hcn j=10 luminosities ( figure 1 ) . in the case of arp193 the observed very low hcn ( 43)/(10 ) line ratio ( its hcn 43 is @xmath14100 times weaker than its co j=32 line ! ) _ is compatible with the complete absence of a massive and dense molecular gas phase .",
    "_ on the other hand for the two archetypal ulirgs arp220 and ngc6240 the hcn ratios are significantly larger than the corresponding ones ( in rotational level ) of hco@xmath4 ( table 1 )",
    ". this , along with the fact that hco@xmath4 rotational transitions also have @xmath15 times lower critical densities than those of hcn , signifies that the latter is tracing a denser gas phase and may thus may remain as the most suitable gas mass tracer in galaxies once the excitation of its rotational lines is properly accounted for .",
    "lllll galaxy & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + arp220 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + ngc6240 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 +",
    "the prototypical ulirg / qso mrk231 is the first object in our sample for which the full set of line observations has been completed , allowing for a unique view into the global excitation conditions of its molecular gas .",
    "analysis of the relative strengths of the co j=10 , 21 , 32 , 43 , 65 and hcn j=10 , 43 lines ( and @xmath28co j=21 from the literature,@xcite ) finds the low - j co lines dominated by diffuse ( @xmath29 ) , and warm ( @xmath30 ) gas , while the high - excitation co j=65 , 43 and the hcn transitions trace a denser ( @xmath31 ) phase with somewhat lower temperatures ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the latter dominates the total molecular gas mass in mrk231 , and its total co line cooling is similar to that of the cii line at @xmath33 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "_ this suggests a different thermal balance to that of lower ir - luminosity galaxies , _ and may explain the relative weakness of the cii cooling line in such systems as a result of the dominance of dense photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) for most of their molecular gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high - j co and the hcn lines detected in mrk231 provide good constraints on radiative transfer models which then allow a good co sled to be constructed .",
    "its comparison with objects at high redshifts shows that despite the high excitation of its dense molecular gas its co sled stands as rather average ( figure 3 ) .",
    "however , strong lensing ( affecting several objects in figure 3 ) can selectively amplify the highly excited co line emission of compact starburst regions at the expence of a much more extended low - excitation non - star forming molecular gas phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the high - j co observations usually conducted after spectroscopic redshifts of high - z objects become available may select mostly from a subset of starbursts where the ( star - forming)/(non star - forming ) h@xmath34 gas mass ratio ( expected to vary strongly in the several merger systems among lirgs ) is particularly large",
    ". the limited sensitivity of today s cm and mm / sub - mm single dish telescopes and interferometers will further accentuate the aforementioned biases , which may thus _ produce co sleds at high redshifts which are biased towards the high excitation regime _ , and are thus unrepresentative of the full excitation range in star - forming galaxies .    in that respect co ( and hcn ) sleds of local ulirgs , established from observationally",
    "well - sampled j - ladders of rotational transitions , are indispensible as benchmarks unaffected by the aforementioned biases .",
    "lllll galaxy & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + 17208 - 0014 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 + 05189 - 2524 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 +    molecular gas excitation at levels far below those found in mrk231 or other such galaxies used as templates for high redshift starbursts ( e.g. arp220 ) , have been uncovered by our ongoing survey , further underlying the need for local co sleds to be established for a large sample of local lirgs .",
    "the two ulirgs ( @xmath47 ) iras17208 - 0014 and iras05189 - 2524 have been found to have very different co line excitation ( figure 4 ) despite similar ir continuum and co j=10 line luminosities and similar @xmath48 ratios . for iras17208 - 0014",
    "the co brightness temperature ratios measured are typical for the high - excitation star forming molecular gas found in many such galaxies , but those found for the `` cold '' iras05189 - 2524 are surprisingly typical of the quiescent molecular clouds found in the milky way disk ( table 2 ) .",
    "one - phase radiative transfer models using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation and constrained by the line ratios of iras17208 - 0014 are compatible with densities of @xmath49 and mostly warm @xmath50 .",
    "the high @xmath51co/@xmath11co j=21 ratio measured for this merger system ( table 2 ) is responsible for the low co j=10 optical depths ( @xmath52 ) of this gas phase , a result of its high temperatures and large average velocity gradients @xmath53 ( for an abundance of @xmath54=10^{-4}$ ] ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to a parameter @xmath55 , typical of an unbound gas phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the high ( 43)/(10 ) co ratio ( comparable to that of co(32)/(10 ) ) can not be accounted by a single gas phase model and probably signifies the emergence of a second warmer and denser phase . in several",
    "lirgs ( e.g. mrk231 ) such a phase has been found to dominate co @xmath56 , @xmath57 and hcn line emission and containing most of their molecular gas mass , and is most likely the direct fuel of their prodigious star formation .",
    "the co emission in iras05189 - 2524 on the other hand is compatible with gas of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , typical of the quiescent and mostly self - gravitating molecular clouds found in the galactic disk immersed in a fuv radiation field of @xmath61 ( habing units ) . in such conditions high - j co lines",
    "are expected to be very faint with @xmath62 for @xmath63 for the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "this is much lower than that expected from co sleds of other ulirgs such as mrk231 or arp220 or indeed most high redshift objects ( @xcite ) , with only the extremely red object hr10 coming close ( figure 3 ) .",
    "thus starburst galaxies at high resdshifts with similar co sleds to that of iras05189 - 2524 _ would remain undetected by typical high - j co observations with today s radio telescopes , _ even after scaling their co line fluxes by their @xmath64 times higher ir luminosities .",
    "one of the goals of the co and hcn multi - transition survey of lirgs is to find how often such low - excitation molecular sleds occur in starbursts , and seek out correlations with other galaxy characteristics ( e.g. merger status , starburst age , dust temperatures ) .",
    "this may in turn shed some light into how otherwise vigorously star - forming galaxies can harbor large amounts of low - excitation molecular gas .",
    "we report preliminary results from our ongoing co and hcn multi - transition of 30 local lirgs , the largest such survey to date .",
    "these can be summarized as follows ,    * a large range of hcn line excitation precludes the simple use of the hcn or hco@xmath4 j=10 line luminosity as a dense gas mass tracer . * in the two cases of arp220 and ngc6240 , the hcn versus the hco@xmath4 line excitation suggests the former tracing the densest gas phase . * in the ulirg / qso mrk231 the luminous co j=43 and j=65 line emission emanates from a different gas phase than the one dominating the low - j co transitions . in that phase total",
    "co line cooling is comparable to that of the cii line at @xmath65 .",
    "if confirmed for more such galaxies this raises the possibility of a very different thermal balance than that seen in lower ir - luminosity systems where the cii line is the dominant coolant . *",
    "the discovery of very low co excitation in the ulirg iras05189 - 2524 raises the possibility of a large excitation bias against detecting similar objects at high redshifts via their high - j co line emission .",
    "we would like to thank the telescope operators and staff of the jcmt and iram 30-m telescope for their assistance during the extensive observations that made this project possible .",
    "special thanks to jim hoge , per friberg and iain coulson at the jcmt for expert advice and assistance with the observations during many years .",
