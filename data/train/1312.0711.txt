    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) , proposed by wigner to explain the statistical properties of nuclear spectra , has elucidated a remarkable success in understanding complex systems which include disordered systems , quantum chaotic systems , spectra of large complex atoms , etc .",
    "recently complex networks have also been analyzed in rmt framework bringing them into the universality class of gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite .",
    "systematic investigations performed on model networks establish correlation between their structural properties and spectral properties inspected by rmt .",
    "this paper validates the access of a mathematical tool , rmt , to study protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks of different species , as model systems , under rmt framework . by interaction",
    "we mean that a protein may change conformation of another protein leading to a change in its affinity for different groups or may lead to addition or removal of a group in the molecule .",
    "the interaction is highly specific i.e. it can discriminate among thousands of different molecules in its environment and selectively interact with one or two @xcite .",
    "a network representation of ppi in addition to providing a better understanding of protein function , serves us with a powerful model of various functional pathways elucidating mechanics at cellular level @xcite .",
    "recently it has been realized that analysis of a network representation of such interactions , in comparison to pairwise analysis , provides a much better understanding of the processes occurring in biological systems @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate a strong correlation between the interaction networks and expression properties of the proteins having similar expression dynamics i.e. they tend to form clusters of either static or dynamic proteins @xcite .",
    "furthermore , analysis of ppi networks have contributed in various disease related biological studies , for instance study of human interaction data and alzheimer s disease proteins has enriched our knowledge about its protein targets @xcite .",
    "some of the ppi network studies reveal that pathogens tend to interact with hub proteins and proteins that are central to many paths in the network @xcite .",
    "analysis performed here involves construction of networks in such a way that any pair of proteins can achieve only two states i.e. either they are connected or not connected .",
    "we demonstrate that nearest neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) of ppi networks of different species exhibit a similar statistical behavior of rmt , bringing them all under the same universality class .",
    "furthermore , long range correlations in spectra display a wide range of behaviors .",
    "the random matrix approach regarded the hamiltonian of a heavy nucleus ( which is very complex due to the complexity of interactions between various nucleons ) as behaving like a random matrix chosen from gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) having a probability density @xmath0 .",
    "energy levels were approximated by the eigenvalues of this matrix and their statistics were studied @xcite .",
    "the functional form of @xmath0 defines the type of ensemble .",
    "later this theory was successfully applied in the study of spectra of different complex systems including disordered systems , quantum chaotic systems , spectra of large complex atoms etc @xcite .",
    "rmt is also shown to be of great use while understanding the statistical structure of the empirical cross - correlation matrices appearing in the study of multivariate time series .",
    "the classical complex systems where rmt has been successfully applied are stock market @xcite ; brain @xcite ; patterns of atmospheric variability @xcite , physiology and dna - binding proteins @xcite etc .",
    "our previous studies elucidate that different model networks , namely scale - free , small world , random networks and modular networks ensue universal goe statistics of rmt .",
    "a network is represented in the form of an adjacency matrix in which a corresponding element @xmath1 is set to 1 if @xmath2 node is connected with @xmath3 node and 0 otherwise .",
    "the set of eigenvalues of an adjacency matrix is called its spectrum .",
    "spectrum of a network is related with its various topological properties @xcite .",
    "spectral density of adjacency matrix of a random network reflects a semicircular law @xcite , which interestingly is one of the properties of random matrix chosen from a gaussian ensemble @xcite .",
    "even though the analysis of some real world networks and various model networks capturing real world properties manifest somewhat different spectral densities @xcite , our previous studies reveal the universal goe statistics of eigenvalue fluctuations of the above mentioned networks @xcite .",
    "this similarity in the nnsd of spectra of a random matrix and that of different model networks furnishes more insight into the physical significance of spectra of networks .",
    "these eigenvalues can be treated as elements signifying different topological states of a network or it can be said that the spectra of a network gives us information about the property which is used to define the entries of adjacency matrix ( connections ) of network , as in case of nuclear spectra , different energy levels of nucleus are approximated by eigenvalues of a random matrix ( representing hamiltonian i.e. energy of system ) .",
    "one more aspect , which this connection between rmt and networks demonstrate , is the existence of some amount of randomness in these networks .",
    "we take our previous studies a step further and validate the applicability of rmt on ppi networks , demonstrating that they all come under the same universality class .",
    "to construct ppi networks of different species , first interaction data is downloaded from publicly available data source dip ( database of interacting proteins ) @xcite .",
    "dip manages a database for experimentally determined protein interactions in all organisms .",
    "it integrates information from different sources to create a single set of protein protein interaction .",
    "data from this source is widely used for various data analyses and biological studies @xcite . in the database , each protein and each interaction is represented by a unique i d , and for each interaction , information of interactors are given . with this information , an interaction network is constructed for a species . here",
    "nodes of the network are represented by the proteins and a connection in the network corresponds to the interaction occurring between the two protein represented by two nodes .",
    "next we detect largest connected cluster in these networks .",
    "corresponding adjacency matrix has a entry @xmath4 if protein @xmath2 interacts with protein @xmath3 and 0 otherwise .",
    "ppi networks are undirected and so the adjacency matrix is symmetric entailing all real eigenvalues . in all the networks , a protein interaction with itself , if any , are ignored .",
    "below we provide a brief description of different species studied here .",
    "in the following , we introduce spacing distribution of random matrices . let eigenvalues of a network be denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 . in order to get universal properties of the fluctuations of eigenvalues ,",
    "it is customary in rmt to unfold the eigenvalues by a transformation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is average integrated eigenvalue density @xcite .",
    "since we do not have any analytical form for @xmath9 , we numerically unfold the spectrum by polynomial curve fitting ( for elaborate discussion on unfolding , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after unfolding , average",
    "spacing becomes unity , independent of the system . using the unfolded spectra",
    ", we calculate spacings as @xmath10 . in the case of goe statistics ,",
    "the nearest neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) is denoted by @xmath11    for intermediate cases , the spacing distribution is described by brody parameter @xcite .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by the parameter @xmath15 as follows : @xmath16^{\\beta+1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ eq_brody ]    this is a semi - empirical formula characterized by parameter @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath15 goes from 0 to 1 , the brody distribution smoothly changes from poisson to goe .",
    "we fit spacing distributions of different networks by the brody distribution @xmath17 .",
    "this fitting gives an estimation of @xmath15 , and consequently identifies whether the spacing distribution of a given network is poisson , goe , or the intermediate of these two @xcite .",
    "apart from nnsd , the next nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnnsd ) is also used to characterize the statistics of eigenvalue fluctuations .",
    "we calculate this distribution @xmath18 of next nearest - neighbor spacing , @xmath19 between the unfolded eigenvalues .",
    "factor of two at the denominator is inserted to make the average of next nearest- neighbor spacing @xmath20 unity . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the nnnsd of goe matrices is identical to the nnsd of gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) matrices , i.e. , @xmath21 the nnsd and nnnsd reflect only local correlations among the eigenvalues .",
    "the spectral rigidity , measured by the @xmath22-statistics of rmt , preserves information about the long - range correlations among eigenvalues and is a more sensitive test for studying rmt properties of the matrix under investigation . in the following ,",
    "we describe the procedure to calculate this quantity .",
    "the @xmath22-statistics measures the least - square deviation of the spectral staircase function representing average integrated eigenvalue density @xmath23 from the best fitted straight line for a finite interval of length @xmath24 of the spectrum given by @xmath25 ^ 2 d\\overline{\\lambda } \\label{eq_delta3}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are regression coefficients obtained after least square fit .",
    "average over several choices of x gives the spectral rigidity @xmath28 .",
    "for goe case , @xmath28 depends logarithmically on l , i.e. @xmath29",
    "in this section we present various results obtained for each of the different ppi networks constructed .",
    "all the results are produced for the adjacency matrix corresponding to the largest connected cluster of each network .",
