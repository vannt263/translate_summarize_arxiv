    "one of the most important goal in qcd spin physics is to understand the spin structure of the nucleon , i.e. how the nucleon spin is made from its fundamental constituents .",
    "this issue has been of intensive experimental and theoretical investigation over the last decades , in particular by exploring the qcd parton model in deep inelastic processes in terms of unpolarized and helicity parton distributions functions ( pdfs ) . in recent years a precise knowledge of the transverse structure as well as of parton - momentum correlations has emerged as an essential part to unravel the spin and momentum substructure of the nucleon .",
    "this information can only be obtained by considering processes beyond the inclusive reactions , such as semi - inclusive deep - inelastic ( sidis ) lepton nucleon scattering or exclusive lepto - production processes at large momentum transfer . according to the factorization theorem ,",
    "the physical observables of such processes can be expressed as convolution of hard partonic scattering cross sections , and soft non - perturbative objects given by quark - quark correlation functions which generalize the forward matrix elements occurring in the definition of the pdfs . in the case of sidis",
    "processes one deals with transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) which are defined in terms of the same matrix elements entering the definition of pdfs , but without integration over the transverse momentum  @xcite . on the other hand , exclusive processes such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 etc . )",
    "allow to access generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which involve non - forward matrix elements between hadron states with different momentum and/or polarization before and after the scattering  @xcite .",
    "although the tmds and gpds can be seen as two different limiting cases of the same generalized parton correlation functions , no - model independent relations between the two classes of objects has been obtained so far  @xcite .",
    "the tmds contain rich and direct three - dimensional information about the internal dynamics of the nucleon , and in particular can help in understanding the strength of different spin - spin and spin - orbit correlations . on the other hand , the gpds provide new method of spatial imaging of the nucleon , through the definition of impact - parameter dependent spin densities which reveal the correlations between the momentum and spatial distributions of quarks for different quark and target polarizations . a convenient way to make explicit which kind of information on hadron structure",
    "is contained in these quantities is the representation in terms of overlap of light - cone wave functions ( lcwfs ) which are the probability amplitudes to find a given @xmath3-parton configuration in the fock - space expansion of the hadron state  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will confine our analysis to the three - quark sector , by truncating the light - cone expansion of the nucleon state to the minimal fock - space configuration .",
    "the three - quark component of the nucleon have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite-@xcite in terms of quark distribution amplitudes defined as hadron - to - vacuum transition matrix elements of non - local gauge - invariant light - cone operators . unlike these works , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite considered the wave - function amplitudes keeping full transverse - momentum dependence of partons and proposed a systematic way to enumerate independent amplitudes of a lcwf which parametrize the different orbital angular momentum components of the nucleon state .",
    "this approach consists in writing down the matrix elements of a class of three - quark light - cone quark operators which serve to define a complete set of light - cone amplitudes .",
    "these matrix elements can be simplified using color , flavor , spin and discrete symmetries  @xcite , and at the end one finds that six amplitudes are needed to describe the three - quark sector of the nucleon lcwf .",
    "this general classification scheme can be used to obtain the overlap lcwf representation of the tmds and gpds , which in turn can be applied to obtain predictions within specific dynamical models of the nucleon . here",
    "we will adopt a light - cone constituent quark model ( cqm ) which has been successfully applied in the calculation of the electroweak properties of the nucleon  @xcite . as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the starting point is the three - quark wave function obtained as solution of the schrdinger - like eigenvalue equation in the instant - form dynamics .",
    "the corresponding solution in light - cone dynamics is obtained through the unitary transformation represented by product of melosh rotations acting on the spin of the individual quarks . in particular , the instant - form wave function is constructed as a product of a momentum wave function which is spherically symmetric and invariant under permutations , and a spin - isospin wave function which is uniquely determined by su(6 ) symmetry requirements . by applying the melosh rotations , the pauli spinors of the quarks in the nucleon rest frame are converted to the light - cone spinor .",
    "the relativistic spin effects are evident in the presence of spin - flip terms in the melosh rotations which generate non - zero orbital angular momentum component and non - trivial correlations between spin and transverse momentum of the quarks . on the other hand",
    ", the momentum - dependent wave function keeps the original functional form , with instant - form coordinates rewritten in terms of light - cone coordinates .",
    "the explicit expressions of the light - cone amplitudes within this cqm can be found in ref .",
