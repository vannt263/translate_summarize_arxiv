    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow observations are usually explained by a model in which a relativistic fireball shell ( ejecta ) is expanding into a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) . however , there is observational evidence suggesting a link between grbs and massive stars or star formation ( e.g. mszros 2001 for a review ) . an important consequence of a massive star origin for the afterglow is that the fireball shell should be expanding into a pre - burst stellar wind of the progenitor star with a density distribution of @xmath0 ( e.g. chevalier & li 1999 ; mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ; dai & lu 1998 ) .",
    "this wind model is discussed to be consistent with some grb afterglow data ( chevalier & li 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "it is expected that many early optical afterglows will be discovered soon in the observational campaigns led by hete-2 and swift",
    ". long time span ( from right after the grb trigger to a year ) observational data will allow us to distinguish differences between the ism and wind models clearly .    in this paper , we will discuss the optical reverse shock emission for the wind model in detail . the previous study ( chevalier & li 2000 ) gave the discussions for the thick shell case , and we will consider both the thin and thick shell cases .",
    "we show that the angular time delay effect plays an important role in discussing the light curve decaying phase of the reverse shock emission .",
    "we consider a relativistic shell ( fireball ejecta ) with an isotropic energy @xmath1 , an initial lorentz factor @xmath2 and an initial width @xmath3 expanding into a surrounding medium with density distribution of @xmath4 ( wind model ) . in this paper ,",
    "lorentz factors @xmath5 , radii @xmath6 and widths @xmath7 are measured in the laboratory frame where the progenitor is at rest .",
    "thermodynamic quantities : mass densities @xmath8 and internal energy @xmath9 are measured in the fluid comoving frame .",
    "the interaction between the shell and the wind is described by two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the wind and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "the shocks accelerate electrons in the shell and wind material , and the electrons emit photons via synchrotron - cyclotron process .",
    "for the synchrotron process , the spectrum of each shock emission is described by a broken power law with a peak @xmath10 and break frequencies : a typical frequency @xmath11 and a cooling frequency @xmath12 ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) where @xmath13 is the number of electrons accelerated by the shock , @xmath14 is the magnetic field strength behind the shock , @xmath5 and @xmath15 are the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked material and the random lorentz factor of the typical electrons in the shocked material , respectively . assuming that constant fractions ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) of the internal energy @xmath9 produced by the shock go into the electrons and the magnetic field , we get @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "observations of optical afterglows usually start around several hours after the burst trigger . at such a late time , the shocked wind material forms a relativistic blast wave and carries almost all the energy of the system .",
    "chevalier & li ( 1999 ) gave the characteristics of the forward shock ( blast wave ) emission as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 cm ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the redshift and luminosity distance of the burst , respectively , @xmath25 cm for the standard cosmological parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ergs , @xmath32 g @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the observer s time in units of days .",
    "the optical flux from the forward shock decays proportional to @xmath35 initially , and decays faster as @xmath36 after a transition of @xmath37 through the optical band @xmath38hz ( chevalier & li 2000 ) where @xmath39 is the index of the power law distribution of the accelerated electrons . using @xmath40hz , the break time @xmath41 ( the passage of @xmath37 ) and the optical flux ( in the fast - cooling regime ) at that time are @xmath42",
    "at earlier time when the reverse shock crosses the shell , the forward - shocked wind and the reverse shocked shell carry comparable amount of energy .",
    "a significant emission is expected from the reverse shock also ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari & piran 1999a ) . during the reverse",
    "shock crossing , there are four regions separated by the two shocks : the wind ( denoted by the subscript 1 ) , the shocked wind ( 2 ) , the shocked shell material ( 3 ) and the unshocked shell material ( 4 ) . using the jump conditions for the shocks and the equality of pressure and velocity along the contact discontinuity , we can estimate the lorentz factor @xmath43 , the internal energy @xmath44 and the mass density @xmath45 in the shocked regions as functions of three variables @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( sari and piran 1995 ) .",
    "there are two limits to get a simple analytic solution to the hydrodynamic quantities at a shell radius @xmath6 ( sari and piran 1995 ) .",
    "if the lorentz factor is low @xmath49 where @xmath50 , the reverse shock is newtonian which means that the lorentz factor of the shocked shell material is almost unity in the frame of the unshocked shell material .",
    "it is too weak to slow down the shell effectively so that @xmath51 . on the other hand , if the lorentz factor is high @xmath52 , the reverse shock is relativistic , and considerably decelerates the shell material , hence @xmath53 .",
    "since the density ratio @xmath54 is generally a function of @xmath6 , there is a possibility that the reverse shock evolves from newtonian to relativistic during the propagation .",
    "the evolution of the reverse shock depends on the ratio of two radii : @xmath55 where the forward shock sweeps a mass of @xmath56 and @xmath57 where the shell begins to spread if the initial lorentz factor varies by order @xmath2 ( sari & piran 1995 ; kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 )",
    ". another important radius is @xmath58 where the reverse shock crosses the shell .",
    "the lab - frame time it takes for the reverse shock to cross a width @xmath59 of the shell material is given by @xmath60 ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "we can regard @xmath61 as time @xmath62 in the laboratory frame because of the highly relativistic expansion of the shell .",
    "since the whole shell width is @xmath63 $ ] , we obtain @xmath64 $ ] .    considering @xmath65 $ ]",
    ", we can classify the evolution of reverse shocks into two cases by using a critical lorentz factor @xmath66 ( see sari & piran 1995 and kobayashi & zhang 2003 for the ism model ) .",
    "if @xmath67 ( thick shell case ) , the reverse shock is relativistic from the beginning ( at the end of the grb phase ) , which is different from the ism model in which the reverse shock only becomes relativistic later .",
    "the reverse shock crosses the shell at @xmath68 before the shell begins to spread at @xmath69 , and it significantly decelerates the shell material @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 ( thin shell case ) , the reverse shock is initially newtonian and becomes only mildly relativistic when it traverses the shell at @xmath72 .",
    "we can regard @xmath73 as constant ( @xmath74 ) during the shock crossing .",
    "since the wind density at the initial interaction is much larger than the medium density for the ism model , the cooling frequency @xmath75 of the reverse shock emission is much lower than the typical ( injection ) frequency @xmath76 in the wind model",
    ". the random lorentz factor @xmath77 of the electrons that radiate at the cooling frequency @xmath75 could be sub - relativistic or newtonian , @xmath78 for our typical parameters .",
    "this makes the radiation mechanism cyclotron radiation at low frequencies @xmath79 and at early times @xmath80 .",
    "however , the detailed modelling on the cyclotron emission is not important , because the flux is suppressed and determined by the self absorption .",
    "( we will discuss the self - absorption at the end of this subsection . ) on the other hand , the random lorentz factor @xmath81 of the electrons corresponding to the optical frequency @xmath82 is relativistic . since the electron distribution @xmath83 around @xmath81 ( and above it )",
    "is determined by the distribution of injected electrons at the shock , which are relativistic , and by the synchrotron radiation cooling , we apply the conventional synchrotron model to estimates the light curve of optical flashes .    the observer time @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath6 , because the lorentz factor of the shocked shell during the shock crossing @xmath85 $ ] is constant . by using the shock jump conditions , one finds that the scalings before the crossing time @xmath86 are given by @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the thick shell case , and @xmath87 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the thin shell case .",
    "the scalings of the spectral characteristics at @xmath92 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 for thick shell and @xmath95 and @xmath96 for thin shell .",
    "the scalings of @xmath75 and @xmath97 themselves are not correct , but the optical flux estimated by these scalings are right .",
    "we evaluated the scalings to calculate the optical light curve .",
    "the initial shell width @xmath3 is given by the intrinsic duration of the grb , @xmath98 ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ) , the shock crossing time @xmath99 can be written in the following form , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102sec .",
    "we can determine the critical lorentz factor @xmath103 from the observations of the grb and afterglow .",
    "if we detect the shock crossing time @xmath99 ( the reverse shock peak time ) , the lorentz factor during the shock crossing time @xmath104 can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttimes ] ) .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the reverse shock emission at @xmath99 are related to those of the forward shock emission by the following simple formulae , @xmath16 and @xmath39 are the same for two shocked regions . some recent works ( zhang , kobayashi & mszros 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; coburn & boggs 2003 ) show that @xmath105 might be larger than @xmath106 where the subscripts r and f indicate reverse and forward shocks , respectively . in such a case , the formulae are replaced by eqs ( 3)-(5 ) in zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . though the power @xmath97 increases by a factor of @xmath107 compared to a case of @xmath108 , the cooling frequency @xmath109 decreases by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "this results in a dimmer optical reverse emission at the peak time by factor of @xmath111 .",
    "note that in the ism model , the reverse shock emission is in slow cooling regime and that @xmath112 gives a brighter reverse shock emission ( see zhang et al .",
    "( kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) , @xmath113 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nmf ] ) , ( [ eq : ncf ] ) and ( [ eq : fnmax ] ) , we get @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116sec .",
    "the reverse shock emission is in the fast cooling regime @xmath117 during the shock crossing .",
    "so for @xmath92 , the optical flux from the reverse shock increases as @xmath118 for thick shell case ( @xmath119 ) ( chevalier & li 2000 ) , and @xmath120 for thin shell case ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "since the lorentz factor of the forward - shocked material is also constant during shock crossing , the optical emission from the forward shock evolves as @xmath122 at @xmath92 .",
    "but this component is usually masked by the reverse shock emission .    at the shock crossing time @xmath99",
    ", the optical flux reaches the peak @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126    generally , using the time dependences of the spectral characteristics as well as eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) , we can relate this peak flux with the optical flux of the forward shock at the break time , @xmath127 where @xmath128 if @xmath129 is below the optical band , and @xmath130 if it is above .",
    "detection of the peak @xmath131 and the break @xmath132 will give a constraint on the initial lorentz factor @xmath2 .",
    "a similar recipe has been proposed by zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the ism case .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption would reduce our estimate ( [ eq : opticalflash ] ) of the optical flash if it is optically thick .",
    "a simple way to account for this effect is to estimate the maximal flux emitted by the shocked shell material as a blackbody ( sari & piran 1999b ; chevalier & li 2000 ) . the blackbody flux at the optical band @xmath82 and at the peak time @xmath99 is given by @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 jy .",
    "the self - absorption frequency at the peak time is @xmath136 hz .",
    "considering that the peak time @xmath99 is larger than the burst duration @xmath137 , the synchrotron self absorption will not affect the peak flux of an optical flash significantly for long bursts with @xmath138 sec . however , the self - absorption is important at early times ( @xmath139 ) in the wind model .",
    "the optical light curve should initially behave as @xmath140 right after the grb trigger because of the absorption and it turns into @xmath141 later ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "the break time is @xmath142 sec .",
    "the cooling frequency @xmath143 is well below the optical band for our typical parameters , the optical emission from the reverse shock should `` vanish '' after the peak .",
    "however , the angular time delay effect prevents abrupt disappearance .",
    "the optical light curve at @xmath144 is determined by off - axis emissions . in the local frame ,",
    "the spectral power is described by a broken power law with a low and high frequency indices @xmath145 and @xmath146 and the break frequency @xmath147 .",

    ", we get @xmath155 . the optical emission from the reverse shock drops below that from the forward shock within a time scale several times of the peak time @xmath99 .",
    "if the fireball ejecta is collimated in a jet with an opening angle @xmath156 , the duration of the reverse shock emission is @xmath157 .",
    "the angle @xmath156 might be determined from a jet break time @xmath158 of the forward shock emission ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) , even though a jet break in the wind model may not be as clear as that in the ism model ( kumar & panaitescu 2000a ; gou et al .",

    "we now consider this time scale . after",
    "the reverse shock crosses the shell , the profile of the forward - shocked wind begins to approach the blandford - mckee ( bm ) solution ( blandford & mckee 1976 ; kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 ) .",
