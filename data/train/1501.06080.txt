    "the analysis of large networks raises in many of research fields , the ubiquity of large networks makes the analysis of the common properties of these networks important.in the most simplistic way can be seen or analyzed as a collection of vertices and edges but there are a very different way of representing the graph , using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph ( graph spectra ) rather than the vertices and edges themselves.in this study a graph or network @xmath0 defined by pairs @xmath1,where @xmath2 is a set of vertices ( or nodes ) and @xmath3 represent edges(links ) .",

    "they are very context sensitive ( i.e. relative to the graph type ) and they are cryptic in the sense that they store many properties of a graph in a single number that does not lend itself to being easily used to reconstruct the properties it encodes .",
    "however , they are known to encode algebraic and topological information relating to a graph in various ways . in this paper",
    "we contribute toward the investigation of the interpretability of eigenvalues , specifically with a general method to determine the type and the amount of information about a network that each eigenvalue carries .",

    "[ spectrasignatures ] , for example , shows the asymptotic behavior of each eigenvalue for well known regular graphs and how the plots characterize them with various regular patterns , including cyclic behavior for a cycle graph .",

    "[ spectrasignatures](left ) .",
    "when the number of different eigenvalues is small ( i.e. their multiplicity is too high ) and they converge soon to a fixed normalized eigenvalue , this is an indication that the eigenvalue carries no information or is exhausted after a few evolving steps ( i.e. no more information can be extracted , or the graph can be characterized after a few evolving steps ) ( see spectra signatures in fig .  [ spectrasignatures ] ) .",
    "we undertook a novel numerical investigation of the eigenvalues of growing graphs for different classes , shedding light on both known and possibly unexplored properties of eigenvalues for some specific graph types . to this end",
    "we calculated what we defined as spectra signatures of random and complex networks prior to a deeper investigation concerning the information content of synthetic graphs and biological networks .",
    "we have introduced a concept of spectra signatures based upon numerical calculations of growing networks with different group - theoretic and topological properties for the study of evolving network behavior .",
    "we have then moved toward the information content of these networks via estimating their kolmogorov complexity by means of entropy , lossless compression and algorithmic probability ( bdm ) .",
    "we have introduced an analysis based on correlation comparisons of each eigenvalue against the information content of a graph to reveal the most informative eigenvalue for different graph classes .",
    "we found that the largest eigenvalues are negatively correlated to graph complexity even after edge count normalization , while the smallest eigenvalues are in general not correlated or positively correlated , with only a couple of cases of negative correlation .",
    "while most research has focused on a few of the largest eigenvalues of a graph spectrum , we have shown that in actual fact the smallest eigenvalues carry a high information content as often as the largest .",
    "the techniques introduced here can be extended to laplacian matrices , but laplacian matrices carry only redundant information about the degree of the vertices because the original graph can be reconstructed from the adjacency matrix alone .",
    "thus the effect of @xmath9 on the laplacian or simple spectra of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath10 is negligible . for kolmogorov complexity",

    "we believe this is a novel approach to extracting meaning from and thus contributing to the solution of the problem of the interpretability of graph spectra , a fundamental step toward applications of graph spectra theory in network biology , especially in the context of evolving networks  given that some biological models are represented as ordinary differential equations for which this approach , when applied to the jacobian matrices of the odes , is thoroughly relevant . as introduced here , this approach promises to be able to reveal specifics about the behavior of a biological network over time through the study of eigenvalues in relation to their information - content .",
    "one future research direction is the investigation of behavioral differences in eigenvalues of networks representing disease as compared to those of healthy networks , both as profiling techniques and as a tool for understanding the direction in which a healthy network may over time progress towards a disease state .",
