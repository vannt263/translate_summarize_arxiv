    "if the tree is decomposable , let @xmath14 be the tree induced by the root and all its subtrees but the rightmost one , and let @xmath18 be the tree induced by the root and its rightmost subtree ( again , adjusting the root labels if necessary ) .",
    "then identify the rightmost leaf of @xmath19 with the root of @xmath15 , this identified node keeping the label @xmath2 of the leaf .",

    "even though @xmath1 was defined and used in @xcite , a proof that @xmath1 is actually an involution has not appeared until it was presented in a formal way in @xcite . in either case , below we provide a sketch of the proof that involves a picture ; this gives an intuitive idea on the non - formal proof that the authors of @xcite originally came up with , and it is helpful for better understanding the structure of fixed points we provide below .",

    "[ involutionh ] , a `` @xmath26 '' next to a node means that the original label of that node goes up by @xmath2 , and a `` @xmath27 '' means that the label of that node is greater than @xmath2 . also , when several nodes have the mark `` @xmath27 '' along a path , it has to be understood as a ( possibly empty ) sequence of nodes with labels greater than  @xmath2 .",
    "[ h - is - involution](@xcite ) the map @xmath1 is an involution , that is , @xmath28 .",

    "the property in figure [ case - to - prove ] is also to be proved by ( parallel ) induction on the size of the tree .     implying immediately that @xmath1 is an involution . ]    to prove the property in figure [ case - to - prove ] , we begin with decomposing the topmost tree @xmath31 , as shown by the first equality in figure [ case - proof ] ( the figure shows the case where @xmath32 is non - empty ; the case it is empty follows in the same way ) .",
    "we can then use the definition of @xmath1 , resulting in the second equality in figure [ case - proof ] .",
    "now we can apply our induction hypothesis on the property in figure [ case - to - prove ] to the smaller tree with right - decomposition based on the trees @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , to obtain the @xmath0-tree on the left of figure [ case - proof-2 ] .",

    "when defining @xmath1 in the indecomposable case ( see figure [ involutionh ] ) we can say that the root of the original tree goes to the rightmost leaf of the image tree .",
