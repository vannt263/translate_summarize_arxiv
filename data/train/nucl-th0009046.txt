    "the formation of @xmath5c in hydrogen burning is blocked by the absence of stable elements at mass numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "pik @xcite and salpeter @xcite pointed out that the lifetime of @xmath12be is long enough , so that the @xmath13@xmath12be reaction can produce macroscopic amounts of equilibrium @xmath12be in stars .",
    "then , the unstable @xmath12be could capture an additional @xmath3 particle to produce stable @xmath5c .",
    "however , this so - called triple - alpha reaction has very low rate since the density of @xmath12be in the stellar plasma is very low , because of its short lifetime of 10@xmath14s .",
    "hoyle ( cited in @xcite ) argued that the triple - alpha reaction can not produce enough carbon in a non - resonant way in order to explain the measured abundance in the universe , therefore it must proceed through a hypothetical resonance of @xmath5c , thus strongly enhancing the cross section .",
    "hoyle suggested that this resonance is a @xmath15 state at about @xmath16mev ( throughout this paper @xmath17 denotes resonance energy in the center - of - mass frame relative to the three - alpha threshold , while @xmath18 denotes the full width ) .",
    "subsequent experiments indeed found a @xmath19 resonance in @xmath5c in the predicted energy region by studies of the reaction @xmath20n(d,@xmath3)@xmath5c @xcite and the @xmath21-decay of @xmath5b @xcite .",

    "its modern parameters , @xmath23mev and @xmath24mev  @xcite , agree well with the old theoretical prediction .      the astrophysical models that determine the amount of carbon and oxygen produced in red giant stars need some nuclear properties of @xmath5c as input parameters .",
    "namely , the position and width of the @xmath22 resonance , which almost solely determines the triple - alpha reaction rate , and the radiative decay width for the @xmath25 transition in @xmath5c .",
    "we calculated these quantities in a microscopic 12-body model @xcite .    in the microscopic cluster model it is assumed that the wave functions of certain nuclei , like @xmath5c , contain , with large weight , components which describe the given nucleus as a compound of 2 - 3 clusters . by assuming rather simple structures for the cluster internal states ,",
    "the relative motions between the clusters , which are the most important degrees of freedom , can be treated rigorously .",

    "the resonant reaction rate for the triple - alpha process proceeding via the ground state of @xmath12be and the @xmath22 resonance in @xmath5c is given approximately by @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the mass and the number density of the alpha particle , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 are planck s and boltzmann s constant , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the stellar plasma is given by @xmath60 .",
    "we calculated the resonance energy @xmath17 of the @xmath22 state in @xmath5c , relative to the @xmath26-threshold , and the @xmath25 radiative ( e2 ) width @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath22 state is situated above the @xmath26-threshold , therefore for a rigorous description one has to use an approach which can describe three - body resonances correctly .",
    "we choose the complex scaling method @xcite that has already been used in a variety of other nuclear physics problems , see e.g.  @xcite .    as a first step of our calculations ,",
    "we fine tune each n - n force ( by slightly changing their exchange - mixture parameters ) to fix @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ alphaa ] ) at its experimental value .",
    "the other important quantity that needs to be calculated is the radiative width of the @xmath22 state , coming from the electric dipole ( e2 ) decay into the @xmath62 state of @xmath5c .",
    "this calculation involves the evaluation of the e2 operator between the initial @xmath22 three - body scattering state and the final @xmath62 bound state @xcite .",
    "the proper three - body scattering - state treatment of the @xmath22 initial state is not feasible in our approach for the time being , therefore we use a bound - state approximation to it .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for the calculation of @xmath63 because the total width of the @xmath22 state is very small ( 8.5ev @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath63 is rather sensitive to the energy difference between the @xmath22 and @xmath62 states , so we have to make sure that the experimental energy difference is correctly reproduced .",
    "the composition of the interstellar material ( ism ) is a mixture of ejecta from stars with different masses . at present",
    "it is not clear which type of stars contribute most of the @xmath5c or @xmath64o to the ism .",
    "therefore , we performed stellar model calculations for a typical massive , intermediate - mass and low - mass star with masses 20 , 5 , and 1.3@xmath65 , respectively , including the calculated triple - alpha reaction rates .",
    "we used a modern stellar evolution code , which contains the most recent input physics @xcite .",
    "up - to - date solar models can be calculated with this program @xcite as well as the evolution of low - mass stars can be followed through the thermal - pulse phase of stars at the asymptotic giant branch @xcite . the nuclear network is designed preferentially to calculate the h- and he - burning phases in low - mass stars . additionally ,",
    "all basic reactions of c- and o - burning are included , which may destroy the previously produced c and o in massive and intermediate - mass stars .    here",
    ", the stars are followed from the onset of h - burning until the third thermal pulse on the agb , or until the core temperature reaches @xmath66k in the case of the 20@xmath67 star ( the nuclear network is not sufficient to go beyond this phase ) .",
    "large portions of the initial mass of a star are returned to the ism through stellar winds .",
    "unfortunately , basically due to the simple convection model used in stellar modeling , the composition of the wind can not yet be determined very accurately from stellar evolution theory .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of the present investigations to determine how and when the material is returned to the ism .",
    "instead we examine how much c and o is produced altogether .    for the 1.3@xmath65 star , which loses its envelope basically during the thermal - pulse phase ,",
    "the maximum c and o abundances in the he - burning region have been extracted .",
    "although the efficiency of the dredge - up of heavy elements to the surface is only badly known , it is independent of the nuclear physics , and hence should be similar in all models independent of the triple - alpha rate . by taking the maximum abundances in this region , we have a measure of how strongly the enrichment of the stellar envelope by c or o is altered by modifying the triple - alpha rate .    in the 5 and 20@xmath65 stars further fusion reactions like c- and o - burning take place .",
    "the dredge - up process of metal - enriched material under these circumstances is more complicated and more uncertain than in the 1.3@xmath65 star .",
    "the 20@xmath65 star finally even explodes in a supernova .",
    "therefore , for the 5 and 20@xmath65 stars the total amount of c and o in the stellar interior is evaluated .",
    "in this section we slightly vary the strength and range parameters of the mn- and mhn - potentials and calculate the modified resonance energies @xmath17 and gamma widths @xmath61 of the @xmath22 state in @xmath5c . with these values of @xmath17 and @xmath61",
    "we recalculate the triple - alpha reaction rate @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ alphaa ] ) .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath63 is very little changed by the small variations of the n - n interactions , leading to negligible changes in @xmath68 .",
    "thus , in the stellar model calculations we can fix @xmath63 to its experimental value in all cases .",
    "the resonance energy @xmath17 , however , is rather sensitive to variations in the n - n force , leading to large changes in the triple - alpha rate @xmath68 . by making the n - n force weaker ,",
    "the resonance energy @xmath17 moves higher and the reaction rate @xmath68 decreases exponentially as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ alphaa ] ) .",
    "the opposite is true for a stronger n - n force .",
    "we have done a series of tests in order to make sure that the main assumptions of our calculations remain valid while the interactions are varied . here",
    "we mention only three main points .",
    "we checked that the use of eq .",
    "( [ alphaa ] ) is justified for all the different resonance energies as well as temperatures occurring in our calculations . in all cases",
    "the triple - alpha reaction is dominated by the sequential process through the @xmath12be ground state and the @xmath22 state of @xmath5c .",
    "the amount of variations in the strength of the coulomb and strong interaction are small enough to keep the experimental @xmath12be ground state and the @xmath22 state of @xmath5c from becoming a broad state or a bound state .",
    "we also estimated the non - resonant contribution @xcite , without the @xmath22 resonance in @xmath5c , to the triple - alpha rate and found that this contribution is about 7 - 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the resonant contribution in the stellar temperature range @xmath69k arising in our stellar - model calculations .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the next higher - energy @xmath19 resonance ( at about 2.7mev above the three - alpha threshold @xcite ) to the triple - alpha rate is smaller by about 40 orders of magnitude in the considered temperature range .",
    "also , in the above temperature range the reaction will not proceed through the low - energy wing of the @xmath12be resonance @xcite .",
    "some of the carbon , produced in the triple - alpha process , is further synthesized in the @xmath70 and @xmath71 reactions .",
    "the @xmath71 reaction is nonresonant , so variations in the strengths of the strong force can have only small effects on its reaction rate .",
    "the @xmath70 process may look more dangerous because its cross section is strongly affected by subthreshold states in the @xmath64o nucleus @xcite .",
    "if the n - n force is made weaker , then the subthreshold states become less bound , thereby enhancing the @xmath70 cross section . therefore , in the case of a weaker force the small c / o ratio is further decreased .",
    "an analogous reasoning holds for a stronger force .",
    "thus , without doing any calculation for the @xmath72 and @xmath71 reactions with the modified forces , we can conclude that their effect would strengthen our hypothesis regarding carbon and oxygen production",
    ".    there may be other windows for different values of the fundamental interactions in which an appreciable amount of carbon and oxygen could be produced .",
    "the window that seems to be closest to the values realized in our universe is the creation of oxygen and carbon in the big bang @xcite .",
    "this possibility is prevented in our universe by the existence of the stability gaps at mass numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to make @xmath73he or @xmath73li as well as @xmath12be become bound",
    ", we calculated that the strong forces would have to be increased by about 10% , a value that is about a factor 20 larger than the maximal variation investigated in this work .",
    "we multiply now in the mn- and mhn - potentials independently the strength parameters @xmath53 as well as the range parameters @xmath54 for all repulsive and attractive terms @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ nnp ] ) by the same factor @xmath74 .",
    "this factor was set between 0.994 and 1.006 for the strength parameters and 0.997 and 1.003 for the range parameters of the mn and mhn potentials . with these values for the factor @xmath74 we recalculate the resonance energies and the triple - alpha reaction rates . for each of these new reaction rates",
    "we then perform again the corresponding stellar model calculations .",
    "the resulting changes in the c and o abundances are shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with respect to the case , where the standard value of the resonance energy has been used ( i.e. , with no variations of the strength or range parameters of the mn- and mhn - potentials ) .    ) and oxygen ( @xmath75 ) mass abundances ( @xmath76 ) through variations of the strength ( lower ordinate ) and range parameters ( upper ordinate ) of the nucleon - nucleon potentials mn and mhn .",
    "the abundance changes are shown in panels a , b , and c for stars with masses of 20 , 5 , and 1.3@xmath65 , respectively , in units of the standard values @xmath77 .",
    "the dashed curves are drawn to guide the eye.,width=529 ]    because each shift in the resonance energy can be identified with a variation in the strength or range parameter of the corresponding n - n force , we scaled the lower and upper ordinate with variations in these quantities , respectively .    we conclude that a change of more than about 0.5% in the strength parameters or 0.2 - 0.3% in the range parameters of the mhn- or mn - potential would destroy either nearly all c or all o in every star .",
    "this implies that irrespective of stellar evolution the contribution of each star to the abundance of c or o in the ism would be negligible .",
    "this corresponds to a fine tuning that is about two orders of magnitude better than obtained from the constraints of a bound deuteron @xcite or from the non - existence of a bound diproton or dineutron @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one can see that the size of the resulting change in the abundances with the variation of the range parameters @xmath54 is about twice the size of the change coming from the variation of the strength parameters @xmath53 .",
    "this can be understood quite simply , because we only considered small variations ( @xmath780.5% ) of the strength and range parameters , respectively . in this case",
    "the changes in the strength and range parameters in eq .",
    "( [ nnp ] ) @xmath79 lead to a change in the spatial parts in the potential for @xmath80 @xmath81 = ( 1 \\pm \\delta v_{0k } ) v_{k}(r ) , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "v_{k}^{\\prime}(r ) & = & v_{0k } \\exp \\left[- \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0k}^{\\prime}}\\right)^2\\right ] \\approx v_{0k } \\exp \\left[- ( 1 \\mp 2 \\delta r_{0k } ) \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0k}}\\right)^2\\right ] \\approx ( 1 \\pm 2 \\delta r_{0k } ) v_{k}(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second line we used a mean potential range parameter @xmath82 in the first - order correction term .",
    "therefore , in the above approximation a change in the range parameter @xmath54 corresponds to a twice as large change , @xmath83 , in the strength parameter .",
    "in this section we investigate the constraints on the anthropically allowed quark masses following largely the discussion already given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the one - boson exchange potential ( obep ) for the n - n force can be written as a sum of yukawa terms @xmath84 where the f s and m s are the coupling constants and masses of the @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 mesons , respectively .",
    "the obep - potential has a long - range tail from one - pion exchange , an attractive minimum due to the exchange of the hypothetical @xmath86-meson and a repulsive core due to the @xmath87-meson .",
    "in the following we will only consider the long - range part due to the pion , the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) , @xmath88    for small changes of the pion mass , @xmath89 we obtain @xmath90}{r } \\approx \\left(1 \\mp \\frac{\\delta m_{\\pi}}{m_{\\pi}}\\right ) v_{\\rm opep}(r),\\ ] ] where in the second line we used a mean potential range given by the pion mass @xmath91 in the first - order correction term .",
    "the range defined by the inverse pion - mass is therefore also limited to a @xmath92 window .",
    "here we assumed that the sensitivity of the carbon production to the potential strength is similar in the opep and mn / mhn cases , respectively .",
    "as long as the up- and down - quark masses are small compared to the qcd scale , the mass of the pion is well approximated by @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sum of the up- and down - quark masses @xmath94 scales with the pion mass @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "thus the anthropically allowed value of the sum of the up- and down - quark masses are fine tuned to approximately 1% . using the quark masses",
    "@xmath97mev and @xmath98mev the anthropically allowed sum of the up- and down - quark masses @xmath99 is constrained to within about 0.15mev .",
    "this is consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite where a value in the order of 0.05mev is given .",
    "constraints can also be obtained for the difference of the down- and up - quark masses , @xmath100 .",
    "we do not consider possible variations of the electron mass as in ref .",
    "the constraint for the upper limit of @xmath101 follows from the restriction that the pp - fusion @xmath102 is exothermic .",
    "this gives an allowed range of @xmath103mev .",
    "the constraint for the lower limit of @xmath101 follows from the stability of the hydrogen atom , i.e. that the proton capture of an electron @xmath104 is endothermic .",
    "this gives an allowed range of @xmath105mev .",
    "the stability of the proton and deuteron give also constraints for the lower and upper limit of @xmath101 .",
    "however , these constraints are less stringent than the ones obtained from the ones given above @xcite .",
    "the resulting anthropically allowed strengths of the up- and down - quark masses are given by the central region of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as can be seen from this figure the anthropic fine tuning of the up- and",
    "down - quark masses is less than a few percent .",
    "the band around @xmath106 determined by the production of carbon and oxygen is about four times narrower than the band around @xmath107 .",
    "that means that the constraints of carbon or oxygen production give a stronger fine tuning than the constraints determined from the reactions of eqs .",
    "( [ pp ] ) and ( [ pe ] ) .",
    "if additional joint constraints that unification imposes on the fermion masses like the ratio @xmath108 are taken into account @xcite , three - dimensional constraining plots for the up - quark , down - quark and electron masses can be derived .     and variations of the down - quark mass @xmath109 .",
    "the following constraints are determined by the straight lines in the figure : ( i ) the pp - fusion in eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) is exothermic , ( ii ) the proton capture of an electron in eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) is endothermic , ( iii ) the carbon production is not suppressed , and ( iv ) the oxygen is production is not suppressed .",
    "these four constraints determine the upper and lower bounds of the bands around @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively.,width=340 ]    similar considerations @xcite can be carried out for the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath112 and the higgs mass parameter @xmath113 .",
    "since the up- and down - quark masses scale simply with the higgs vacuum expectation value , the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath114 and higgs mass parameter @xmath113 are also fine tuned by anthropic considerations to approximately @xmath115% .",
    "in this work we have shown that the strength or range of the strong force is fine tuned to @xmath116% by the production of carbon or oxygen and therefore also carbon - based life .",
    "this leads to a fine tuning of the sum of the light quark masses as well as the higgs vacuum expectation value and mass parameter to about @xmath115% .",
    "one of the most fascinating aspects resulting from this is that life , stars , nuclei and elementary particles seem to be closely interwoven in our universe through this extreme fine tuning .",
    "it is not clear if the values of the fundamental parameters corresponding to this anthropic fine tuning will be calculable by a future final theory @xcite or if some of the parameters of such a final theory will have to be chosen from a large or continuous ensemble @xcite . in any case",
    "it will be one of the challenges for a possible final theory to explain the anthropic fine tuning as described in this paper .",

    "<S> in nucleosynthesis three possible paths are known to bridge the mass gaps at @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the primary path producing the bulk of the carbon in our universe proceeds via the triple - alpha process @xmath2he(2@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath5c . </S>",
    "<S> this process takes place in helium - burning of red giant stars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that outside a narrow window of about 0.5% of the strength or range of the strong force , the stellar production of carbon or oxygen through the triple - alpha process is reduced by factors of 30 to 1000 . outside this small window </S>",
    "<S> the creation of carbon or oxygen and therefore also carbon - based life in the universe is strongly disfavored . </S>",
    "<S> the anthropically allowed strengths of the strong force also give severe constraints for the sum of the light quark masses as well as the higgs vacuum expectation value and mass parameter at the 1% level . </S>"
