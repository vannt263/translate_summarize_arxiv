    "the numerical simulation of qcd equation of state ( eos ) predicts that nuclear matter at high density and/or temperature are composed of quarks and gluons due to asymptotic freedom and screening of colour charges  @xcite .",

    "the evolution of the collectivity within the system is sensitive to the eos .",
    "therefore , the study of the collectivity in the system formed after nuclear collisions will be useful to shed light on the eos  @xcite of the strongly interacting system at high temperatures and densities .",

    "comparison of dilepton production from qgp and hadronic sources  @xcite indicate that in the low @xmath98 and high @xmath99 region the emission rate from qgp dominates over its hadronic counter part if the medium effects on the vector meson spectral functions are neglected .",
    "in other words , for a dynamically evolving system the low and high @xmath2 pairs are emitted from early qgp phase , whereas lepton pairs with @xmath2 around @xmath6 - mass are emitted from the late hadronic phase .",

    "therefore , an increase in @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) will increase the radial flow in the partonic phase if the initial and the critical temperatures are kept fixed . however , an increase in @xmath107 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 produces same flow if the @xmath86 decreases by a factor @xmath111 . for a fixed @xmath86 an increase in @xmath107 will increase the effective slope as evident from the right panel of fig .",
