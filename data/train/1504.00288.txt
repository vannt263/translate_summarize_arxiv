    "according to the recent review , a quantum computing ( qc ) allows the possibility of @xmath8 as a valid state , and an identifiable quantum logic manipulates such superpositions @xcite .",
    "the study of this generalization of binary logic to quantum two - level systems is called quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "the most important criterion is that the information encoded in the amplitudes and phases in the complex numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 describing the superposition state @xmath8 must be preserved for a longer duration compared to the running time of the quantum computer . to implement this in practice , a physical system that is suitable for embodying quantum bits ( _ qubits _ ) must be identified .",
    "electron spins are considered as the simplest qubits @xcite .",
    "molecular magnets ( mms ) , nanoscale clusters of coupled transition metal ions ( tmis ) , and open - shell molecular spin systems are being pursued @xcite , motivated by their long electron spin relaxation times .",
    "pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) techniques provide an efficient methodology for monitoring the duration of coherent manipulations , a prerequisite for the deployment of these systems in qip applications .",
    "the intrinsic electron spin relaxation times , namely @xmath5 and @xmath11 , appeared to depend significantly on electron spin anisotropies of these magnetic structures .",
    "nature utilizes magnetism ubiquitously , for instance , many of tmis binding to proteins are usually ( super)paramagnetic @xcite . among the other iron - binding proteins , biological [ 2fe-2s ] clusters can have the potential use of molecular electron spins as natural spin qubits for qc / qip . first of all , such clusters are all identical to each other in protein environments and have very stable molecular structures @xcite .",
    "recently , very interesting result appeared that digital information can be stored on dna in an inorganic matrix and recovered without errors for considerably longer time frames @xcite .",
    "for the first time , this letter reports experimental results of electron spin relaxations in the iron - sulfur cluster system using the electron spin echo ( ese ) detected techniques @xcite .",
    "this cluster is the exchange - coupled molecular spin cluster , and its low - spin state arises from antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between electron spins of two high - spin irons @xcite .",
    "its molecular structure is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this is a mixed valence bimetallic cluster , and its low nuclearity structure is relatively simpler than magnetic anisotropy structures of high nuclearity fe@xmath12 and fe@xmath13 clusters @xcite .",
    "this tentatively suggests that the phase coherence relaxation is probably independent of zero - field splitting ( zfs ) in the first - order .",
    "( @xmath14 ) and fe@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with @xmath17 configuration , resulting in the fictitious @xmath1 state . ]",
    "g_-anisotropy was resolved in the field - sweep ese detected spectrum ( figure [ fig2 ] )",
    ". however , no signal was detected at half - field region .",
    "the degeneracy of @xmath18 states is lifted in the applied magnetic field @xmath19 , and the splitting of the electron zeeman interaction becomes directly proportional to the energy of the allowed @xmath20 transition in the absence of large hyperfine interactions .",
    "the interaction between the electron spin and the applied magnetic field @xmath19 expressed in an arbitrary coordinate system can be described by the electron zeeman term :    @xmath21    this spin hamiltonian can no longer contain the @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) because of the low - spin state resulting from an isotropic spin exchange coupling . upon adding the reducing electron in the @xmath24",
    "orbital , the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the high - spin fe@xmath25 ( @xmath14 ) and the high - spin fe@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) sites establishes the low - spin @xmath1 state ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the fe1 site is as the reduced iron with a low negative spin density . in the ferredoxin dimeric structure , two [ 2fe-2s ] clusters are separated at the closest fe1-fe1 distance of 25  , suggesting that rapid electron transfer between these iron sites would be unlikely to occur @xcite .    due to the absence of zfs , it was advantageous to measure the intrinsic relaxation time @xmath5 in this low nuclearity cluster . on the contrary , pulsed epr measurements encountered very challenging problem for measuring @xmath5 in the high - spin mms , namely strong spin decoherence .",
    "as these clusters possess high - spin ground states with large and negative zfs , the spin decoherence resulted from intermolecular interactions or _ spin - spin dipolar interactions _ @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a strong dependence of transition energies on the molecular orientation with respect to the applied magnetic field .    to measure the coherence relaxation time , the simple hahn echo sequence ( @xmath26 )",
    "was applied to monitor the echo decay at @xmath27 k. the decay is monoexponential according to the function @xmath28 from which @xmath5 is deduced .",
    "an observation of the hahn echo demonstrates a quantum coherence . at @xmath29  mt ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "@xmath5 was of the order of @xmath31  ns in the intrinsic @xmath2n protein at @xmath32  k. this is a relatively long - lasting coherence , comparatively exceeding the typical single qubit manipulation of @xmath7  ns for the electron spin @xcite .",
    "the coherence relaxation times were further measured at different temperatures .",
    "even at @xmath33  k , @xmath5 was well above the typical value ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the coherence time also exceeds coherent manipulations of @xmath34  ns of high nuclearity iron clusters with high - spin ground states @xcite . besides , @xmath5 were only measurable for these mms at liquid @xmath35he temperatures between @xmath36  k.     in the intrinsic @xmath2n protein at @xmath37 k ( from top to bottom ) .",

    "@xmath5 were also measured using different pulse separation time @xmath38 to monitor different electron spin packets contributing to the spin echo , and consequently the timescale remained virtually unchanged along @xmath39 with very little error margins .",
    "this suggests that there is no fluctuation in the local field known as _ instantaneous diffusion _ , and the electron spin echo is refocused coherently .",
    "@xmath5 leads to a lower limit for the phase coherence time , assuming that relaxation along @xmath39 is rather faster than that along @xmath40 . at @xmath41  mt ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath5 was of the order of @xmath43  ns accordingly . an orientation - dependence of @xmath5 with distinct maxima along the canonical orientations is a characteristic of glassy domains in biological samples @xcite .",
    "the change in libration frequencies at the canonical orientations is caused by small - angle librations in glassy domains @xcite .",
    "the weak electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) indicates that there is a weak coupling between the electron and nuclear spins ( figure [ fig2 ] ) . by using the longer pulse duration this modulation effect",
    "was eliminated .",
    "a magnitude of the weak isotropic hyperfine coupling was previously determined from 2d eseem experiments .",
    "the nuclear hyperfine interactions can in principle be the major source of the spin decoherence or phase relaxation path , limiting the coherence relaxation time @xcite . to clarify the influence of such decoherence due to the nitrogen hyperfine interactions",

    "the phase decoherence is higher in the intrinsic @xmath2n protein accordingly , significantly limiting @xmath5 .    on the other hand",
    ", this result can be interpreted as otherwise advantage that the isotope labeling fulfills a necessary role in more coherent storage of electron spins in several nitrogen nuclear spins in the protein environments . a method to store",

    "b ) schematic spin state population diagram for the reduced cluster . ]    to monitor the spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath11 were measured using an inversion - recovery sequence ( @xmath48 ) at @xmath49  k. at @xmath29  mt , @xmath11 was of the order of @xmath50s in the intrinsic protein , while @xmath51s in the @xmath4n labeled protein ( figure [ fig3]a ) .",

    "vibrations along the molecular plane can modulate the spin - orbit coupling more strongly than vibrations perpendicular to the plane @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 was the order of @xmath53 @xmath54s at @xmath41  mt accordingly . to notice that @xmath11 are virtually the same order at the canonical orientations , indicating that the spin - lattice relaxation is completely independent of the phase relaxation decoherence . in the [ 2fe-2s ] ,",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation is governed by thermal process such as coupling to phonon instead of magnetic anisotropy since @xmath11 increases as temperature is decreased .",
    "this relaxation can in principle evolve in the two - phonon raman process ( @xmath55 for kramers doublets with @xmath56 ) rather than the one - phonon direct process ( @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the cluster possesses only the low - spin @xmath1 state .",
    "therefore , the two - phonon orbach process ( @xmath58^{-1}$ ] ) can be a more reasonable assumption that the electron spin absorbs phonon to be excited to the energy level above the @xmath1 ground state ( figure [ fig3]b ) , and emits another phonon .",
    "an arrhenius - type temperature dependence led to a reasonable linear fit to the @xmath59 , yielding the energy difference @xmath60 @xmath61 between the ground state and the next excited state .",
    "this value is obviously inside the energy range of the fe@xmath15 ground state consisting of @xmath62 @xmath61 and @xmath63 @xmath61 in the absence of zfs @xcite .",
    "db ( blue ) and @xmath64  db ( red ) after measuring the echo intensity as a function of the nutation pulse length , @xmath65  ns .",
    "b ) fourier transform of nutation spectra obtained after using the 4-step phase cycling for the two - pulse at @xmath29  mt and @xmath32  k. ]    in the echo - detected transient nutation experiment using the pulse sequence ( @xmath66 ) , the electron spin is initially rotated by an arbitrary angle and refocused by the @xmath67 pulse and consequently the echo intensity is detected @xcite . from figure [ fig4]a , the echo intensity as a function of the nutation pulse length exhibits a periodic modulation at @xmath68  db and @xmath64  db at @xmath29  mt , displaying qualitatively the coherent oscillation between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the [ 2fe-2s ] .",
    "the oscillations correspond to rabi cycles with characteristic angular frequencies @xcite",
    ". however , this indirect detection method can be inferior to integration of the free induction decay ( fid ) since the microwave field @xmath71 strength of the the @xmath67 pulse must be much larger than that of the nutation pulse @xcite .",
    "longer pulses cover narrower frequency contents .",
    "therefore , the non - ideal first pulse ( @xmath72  ns ) was incremented in @xmath73 steps of @xmath72  ns for nutating the electron spin echo .",
    "the nutated spin echo was then refocused by the @xmath74 ns pulse , irradiated at @xmath73  ns after the first pulse .",
    "the 4-step phase cycling was applied to eliminate fid from the first and second pulses , and the nutation spectra exhibited extended oscillations up to @xmath75s .",
    "that is because the echoes cross and distort the signal for certain interpulse delays . in fourier",
    "transform spectrum the first component of nutation was observed at @xmath76  mhz by @xmath77  db , corresponding to @xmath78 for @xmath1 of the [ 2fe-2s ] in the @xmath4n labeled protein ( red line in figure [ fig4]b ) .",
    "since the cluster exhibits the low spin - half ground state due to the vanishing fine - structure ( zfs ) in the first order , the arbitrary superpositions between electron spin states can be distinguished by relation @xmath79\\omega_1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the second component at @xmath80  mhz relates to @xmath81\\omega_1 $ ] , identifying that these two frequencies correspond to the transition @xmath82 at moderate power level . at maximum microwave power @xmath68  db ,",
    "the @xmath83 peak merged into the @xmath84 peak to become the nutation at @xmath85  mhz .",
    "therefore , the nutation at @xmath86  mhz belongs to @xmath87\\omega_1 $ ] of the [ 2fe-2s ] in both protein environments ( magenta and blue lines in figure [ fig4]b ) . by increasing microwave power , the typical higher frequency shift and the intensity enhancement near @xmath88",
    "were observed for the high - spin doped powder @xcite .",
    "in summary , the low - spin state of the [ 2fe-2s ] cluster can be considered as the non - degenerate single spin - qubit since the lowest possible quantum number of electron spin projections , i.e. @xmath89 , is created in the applied magnetic field and the corresponding energy splitting between these two states identifies the spin eigenstates @xmath90 .",
    "these eigenstates can be identified as logical basis states @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the single - spin qubit .",
    "this cluster contains @xmath93fe that has no nuclear spin , thus not limiting the phase coherence relaxation time .",
    "this cluster is virtually free of spin - spin dipolar interaction since zero - field splitting cancels out in the first - order .",
    "however , a relevant feature of such weakly exchange - coupled molecular clusters in terms of electronic spin structures is underlain by small zfs parameters comparable with weak nuclear hyperfine and/or isotropic exchange couplings parameters .",
    "the pulsed 2d electron spin nutation ( esn ) can be proposed to determine specifically such small zfs parameters which reflect relatively short distance between electron spins @xcite , of two iron centers of the [ 2fe-2s ] in this case .",
    "both the @xmath22 and exchange interaction @xmath94 parameters can be determined from this type of experiments .",
    "most interestingly , the phase coherence relaxation time measured in this cluster system comparatively exceeds the typical duration @xmath95  ns of a single - spin qubit manipulation even at @xmath33  k. at lower temperature of @xmath32  k , it also exceeds the coherence relaxations measured in high - spin fe@xmath12 and fe@xmath13 clusters at liquid helium temperatures . therefore",
    ", this spin cluster have the huge potential for performing as electron - spin qubits .",
    "a coherent storage of the electron spin in the nitrogen nuclear spins can be realized , motivated by the enhanced @xmath5 measured after labeling the cluster environments with the @xmath4n isotope uniformly .",
    "this approach can be equivalent to the multi - qubit gate operations such as cnot , where the qubits are coupled to nonidentical spins .",
    "on the other hand , this result supports the hypothesis that dipolar coupling with @xmath96h or @xmath97h nuclei provide the dominant phase decoherence path in mms .",
    "these results suggest together that the phase decoherence due to the magnetic nuclei with nuclear spins in the vicinity of the electron spin can be eliminated by replacing them with the non - magnetic nuclei of @xmath98 using chemical modifications .",
    "as proposed in this report , biological [ 2fe-2s ] clusters exist as molecular spin clusters in nature , being independent of the lengthy chemical synthesis and materials processing .",
    "however , progresses would only be made possible by collaborative efforts involving biologist , chemists , and physicists .",
