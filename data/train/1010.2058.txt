    "cosmic observations from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite indicate that our universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion .",
    "the reason for this acceleration , the so - called dark energy problem , remains a fascinating question today . the simplest model to explain this problem is the @xmath3cdm model , in which a time independent energy density is added to the universe .",
    "however , the @xmath3cdm model suffers from both fine - tuning and coincidence problems @xcite . in general",
    ", the ways to understand the cosmic acceleration can be separated into two branches .",
    "one is to modify the matter by introducing some kind of dark energy .",
    "the other one is to modify einsteins general relativity the modification of gravity .    in modified gravity ,",
    "one of the popular approaches is to promote the ricci scalar @xmath4 in the einstein - hibert action to a function , @xmath5 .",
    "although there are several viable @xmath5 models , many of them are restricted to the regimes to be effectively identical to the @xmath3cdm by the observational constraints .",
    "recently , linder @xcite has explored an @xmath5 theory named exponential gravity , which has also been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the exponential gravity has the feature that it allows the relaxation of fine - tuning and it has only one more parameter than the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "in addition , the exponential gravity satisfies all conditions for the viability @xcite such as the local gravity constraint , stability of the late - time de sitter point , constraints from the violation of the equivalence principle , stability of cosmological perturbations , positivity of the effective gravitational coupling , and asymptotic behavior to the @xmath3cdm model in the high curvature regime . in this paper",
    ", we will study the constraints given by latest observational data , reexamine the alleviation of the fine - tuning problem , and find the possibility of the derivation from @xmath3cdm .",
    "we use units of @xmath6 and the gravitational constant is given by @xmath7 with the planck mass of @xmath8gev .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exponential - gravity ] , we review equations of motion and the asymptotic behavior at the high redshift regime in the exponential gravity model . in sec . [",

    "the action of @xmath5 gravity with matter is given by @xmath9+s_{m } , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath5 is a function of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the exponential gravity model @xcite , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is related to the characteristic curvature modification scale .",
    "since the product of @xmath1 and @xmath12 can be determined by the present matter density @xmath13  @xcite , we can choose @xmath1 and @xmath13 as the free parameters in the model .",
    "we use the standard metric formalism . from the action ,",
    "the modified friedmann equation of motion becomes @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter , a subscript r denotes the derivative with respect to r , a prime represents @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the energy density of all perfect fluids of generic matter including ( non - relativistic ) matter , denoted by @xmath18 , and relativistic particles , denoted by @xmath19 . here , we only consider the matter density .",
    "since the modification by the exponential gravity only happens at the low redshift , the contributions from relativistic particles are negligible . in a flat spacetime ,",
    "the ricci scalar is given by @xmath20    following hu and sawicki s parameterization @xcite , we define    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the effective dark energy density , and @xmath24 is the present matter density .",

    "numerically , we can get the evolution of the hubble parameter in the low redshift regime ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "( [ fr ] ) becomes negligible ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the exponential gravity model behaves essentially like a cosmological constant model with the dark energy density parameter @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the hubble parameter as a function of @xmath40 in this regime can be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the density parameter of relativistic particles including photons and neutrinos , where @xmath43 is the present fractional photon energy density and @xmath44 is the effective number of neutrino species @xcite . ] .",
    "the equation ( [ eqn2 - 11 ] ) will be used in the data fitting of cmb and the high redshift part of bao in section [ sec : observational - constraints ] .",
    "to constrain the free parameters of @xmath1 and @xmath13 in the exponential gravity model , we use three kinds of the observational data including sne ia , bao and cmb .",

    "we have studied the exponential gravity model . in the low redshift regime , we follow hu and sawicki s parameterization to form the differential equation for the exponential gravity and solve it numerically . in the high redshift regime , we take advantage of the asymptotic behavior of the exponential gravity toward an effective cosmological constant . the analytical form of the hubble parameter @xmath121 as a function of the redshift @xmath40 can be expressed in the high redshift limit .",

    "current observational data still lack the ability to distinguish between the @xmath3cdm and exponential gravity models .    finally , we remark that as seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : density parameter ] , the noticeable difference between the exponential gravity and @xmath3cdm models lies in the regime @xmath123 , and is maximized at @xmath124 if we compare their expected distance modulus .",
