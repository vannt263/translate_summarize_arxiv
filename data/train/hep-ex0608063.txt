    ", there is a resonant and a non - resonant component : the resonant @xmath12 is produced with a cross section of @xmath13@xmath71.2  nb , the non - resonant continuum with @xmath13@xmath73.0  nb .",
    "the @xmath12 decays into @xmath14@xmath15 meson pairs with a branching fraction higher than 99% , and @xmath799% of all @xmath14(@xmath15 ) mesons decay into final states with hadrons containing charm quarks . in the continuum ,",
    "the cross section of direct charm production is also high , i.e.  @xmath13@xmath71.3  nb . for about 10% of the time ,",
    "data are recorded at @xmath6=10.52  gev , containing only the non - resonant continuum component .",
    "fragmentation is a qcd process which involves not only single partons , but a cascade of many partons , as it is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "a single bare charm quark starts radiating gluons .",
    "the gluons themselves may a. ) radiate additional gluons directly , or b. ) convert into @xmath16@xmath17 , @xmath18@xmath19 or @xmath20@xmath21 quark - antiquark pairs , while those quarks then might radiate additional gluons .",
    "if the distances between the quarks become too large ( @xmath22@xmath231  fm ) , hadronisation starts and final state mesons and baryons are generated .",

    "the study of fragmentation has two aspects : on the one hand , as a theoretical aspect , qcd predicts hadronic confinement , but does not predict how an initial state quark as a pointlike object transforms into a final state hadron , i.e.  an confined object with a formfactor . in most fragmentation models , the splitting of one parton to many partons ( the `` parton shower '' ) is treated in perturbative qcd only , and hadronisation models are only phenomenological with minor predicting capabilities .",
    "heavy quarks are in particular of interest , because their production is strongly suppressed in both the parton shower and the hadronisation .",
    "thus , a final state charmed hadron contains a charm quark , which was produced with a high probability in the primary interaction .    on the other hand , as a practical aspect , it is important to improve monte - carlo ( mc ) event generators .",
    "several other analyses of direct charm production e.g.  production of @xmath38 , @xmath39 etc",
    ".  require mc simulations of charm fragmentation . in this paper pythia@xcite 6.2",
    "the event generators use parameters , which have to be constrained by comparison to experimental data .",
    "the relevant variable for the investigation of the process dynamics is the momentum fraction @xmath9=@xmath40/@xmath41 . as the quark momentum is a priori unknown and",
    "can only be approximated , in this paper @xmath42=@xmath34/@xmath43 is used , where @xmath43 is corrected for the mass of the final state hadron , i.e.  @xmath43=@xmath44 .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath45 is then given as the normalized yield as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "instead of the yield , related quantities such as the cross section d@xmath13/d@xmath42 or br@xmath46d@xmath13/d@xmath42 can be used , where br denotes the branching ratio into the particular final state . for the functional form of fragmentation functions , in pythia the variable @xmath47",
    "is used instead of the variable @xmath42 , which is defined as @xmath47=(@xmath48+@xmath49)@xmath50/(@xmath48+@xmath49)@xmath51 .    as will be shown below",
    ", in particular the high @xmath9 region ( i.e.@xmath42@xmath71 or @xmath47@xmath71 ) might be sensitive to effects of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the @xmath9=1 limit is corresponding to the exclusive process e.g.  @xmath10@xmath11@xmath24@xmath25@xmath26@xmath24@xmath52@xmath53 , in which on either side a bare charm quarks transforms into a hadron , which contains the identical charm quark as a valence quark , but additionally one light valence quark , light sea quarks and sea gluons .",
    "the interesting aspect is that , due to @xmath40=@xmath41 , no momentum is available to create the hadronic structure , but in fact the momentum balance is provided by the qcd vacuum .",
    "fragmentation data of @xmath10@xmath11@xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 at @xmath6@xmath710.6  gev have been measured previously , but with lower statistical significance .",
    "more than 10 years ago , the argus collaboration and the cleo collaboration published@xcite@xmath54@xcite data based upon integrated luminosities of 31.4  @xmath55 and 35.8  @xmath55 , respectively . nowadays , equivalent data are recorded by belle in @xmath750  minutes .",
    "more recently , the cleo collaboration published@xcite @xmath56 and @xmath37 fragmentation data based upon 8.9  @xmath57 . @xmath58 and @xmath59 fragmentation data were published@xcite@xmath54@xcite by cleo and by babar based upon 4.7  @xmath57 and 23.4  @xmath57 , respectively",
    "a data set of 87.7  @xmath57 on - resonance and 15.0  @xmath57 off - resonance is used , and compared to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations corresponding to 217.0  @xmath57 .",
    "the mc simulations are based upon the event generator qq98@xcite for @xmath10@xmath11@xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 , the peterson@xcite fragmentation model , pythia@xcite 6.2 for the parton shower evolution and geant@xcite 3.21 for the detector description . for specific simulations ,",
    "also different fragmentation models are used ( see below ) .",
    "the decay modes used in the reconstruction are listed in tab .  1 .",
    "charge conjugated modes are included .",
    "the efficiencies for particle identification of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are above 96% for all decay modes , the efficiency for protons is 81% .",
    "the particle misidentification probabilities are between 12% and 26% .",
    "this paper represents a short version of the complete analysis which is published elsewhere@xcite . with this unprecedented statistics it became possible to reduce the bin width in @xmath42 by a factor of @xmath73 , and thus investigate the shape of the fragmentation function with high precision , in particular in the high @xmath42@xmath71 region .",
    "in addition , fragmentation into the baryon @xmath62 is measured , for which a high statistics data set has not been available previously .",
    "2 shows the mass distribution for the @xmath52 and the @xmath33 ( as an example for the meson and baryon reconstruction ) .",
    "the signals are shown for a momentum fraction 0.68@xmath63@xmath42@xmath630.70 , which is close to the @xmath42 of peak position in the fragmentation function .",
    "the cross sections are calculated using the fitted signal yields .    as mentioned above , at @xmath6=10.6  gev",
    "there is a resonant and a non - resonant contribution .",
    "thus , charmed hadrons can be produced by @xmath14 decays ( whereas the @xmath14 mesons are produced by decay of the @xmath12 resonance ) or by fragmentation . in a first step",
    ", these two contributions have to be identified .",
    "3 shows the cross section d@xmath13/d@xmath42 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the down - left hatched histogram shows on - resonance data , the down - right hatched histogram shows off - resonance data .",
    "after normalisation using the integrated luminosities of the respective samples , the nave @xmath64 dependence on the total hadronic cross section has been taken into account by a weighting factor @xmath65 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath14 decays is dominant at lower @xmath42@xmath630.5 , as the @xmath14 decay kinematics limits the maximum possible momentum of the charmed hadron to about @xmath40@xmath72.5  gev / c , corresponding to @xmath42@xmath70.5 . the distributions in fig .",

    "fig .  4 is efficiency corrected , and represents the measured fragmentation functions @xmath68 , which can be compared to models .",
    "the inner error bars show the statistical , the outer error bars the total uncertainties .",
    "4 is not yet corrected for feed - down from @xmath37 to @xmath0 .",
    "details of the feed - down contribution are described elsewhere@xcite . the estimated systematic error from @xmath38 feeddown ( e.g.  @xmath69(2308 ) and @xmath70(2427 ) ) is included and is @xmath6613% . tab .",
    "[ t_2 ] shows the functional form of the different fragmentation models which are considered .",
    "these are the peterson@xcite , the kartvelishvili@xcite the collins - spiller@xcite the lund@xcite and the bowler@xcite models .",
    "the ( 1-@xmath9 ) term in all functional forms originates from the kinematics of radiation of one gluon . for every model a @xmath71",
    "is calculated from the bin - by - bin differences between the model and the data , while the model parameters are optimized in a fit procedure in order to find the optimum values .",
    "5 shows the measured @xmath35 fragmentation function in comparison to the models , and tab .",
    "[ t_2 ] lists the minimum @xmath71/_d.o.f._. the number of the degrees of freedom ( _ d.o.f .",
    "_ ) is given by the number of @xmath42 bins minus the free parameters of the fit ( one or two , depending upon the model ) .",
    "for the model comparison , the @xmath37 is chosen instead of the @xmath0 in order to avoid the feed - down correction .",
    "the @xmath71 values for all other hadrons can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 is not based upon the pure functional form , but instead the mc generated fragmentation function according to the functional form .",
    "thus , the detector resolution , as modeled by geant , as well as the parton shower , as modeled by pythia , is taken into account .",
    "the models by collins and spiller and by kartvelishvili are not included in the pythia generator .",
    "therefore , a reweighting procedure has been applied . for each event , the @xmath47 and the @xmath72 values are stored , and the fragmentation function ansatz is recalculated . tab .",
    "[ t_3 ] shows the parameters at the minimum @xmath71 of the fit for all different hadrons .",
    "the fitted parameters indicate that the pythia default parameters are not well suited for charm fragmentation . as an example",
    ", the pythia default for the exponent @xmath73 of the ( 1-@xmath9)@xmath74 term in the lund fragmentation model is @xmath73=0.30 , but our fit gives as result @xmath73=0.68 at the minimum @xmath71 .",
    "however , this is a global pythia parameter , i.e.  the parameter is valid for fragmentation of all quark flavors , and for e.g.  the light quark sector the parameter might be different from our result . as a result of the comparison ,",
    "the bowler and the lund models appear favored .",
    "this is consistent with an observation which was also reported@xcite for @xmath14 meson fragmentation .",
    "the reason might by given by the @xmath75(@xmath76@xmath77/@xmath47 ) term with the explicit use of the transverse mass @xmath78 which appears in the functional form of these two models , but not in any of the other models .",
    "the measured data were used in a theoretical study@xcite in order to investigate possible non - perturbative qcd effects . for this purpose ,",
    "the fragmentation function is split into a perturbative and a non - perturbative part , i.e.  @xmath68=@xmath79+@xmath80 , with    @xmath81\\ ] ]    using the normalisation @xmath82=@xmath83@xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "the factor @xmath86 indicates the relative fraction of the non - perturbative contribution and is determined by a fit . while for the cases of the @xmath37 mesons the non - perturbative contribution is @xmath86@xmath721 - 25% , for the @xmath0 meson it turns out to be quite high with @xmath86@xmath760% .",
    "the reason is , that a large fraction of the @xmath0 mesons arises from @xmath37 decay .",
    "the decay is very close to threshold , and thus the hadron momenta are almost equal , i.e.  @xmath34(@xmath37)@xmath7@xmath34(@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , in the decay , a hadronic formfactor transition from a spin 1 hadron ( i.e.  the @xmath37 ) to a spin 0 hadron ( i.e.  the @xmath0 ) occurs .",
    "the partons involved into this transition must be soft , and thus non - perturbative qcd power corrections are expected to occur .",
    "charm fragmentation functions were measured at @xmath6@xmath710.6  gev with high precision .",
    "the data were compared to five different fragmentation models , and the model parameters for the best fit to the data were given .",
