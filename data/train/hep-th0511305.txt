    "although there is now strong evidence that the universe has a positive cosmological constant @xcite , there is also much interest in studying theories of gravity with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this interest followed the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory conjecture , which proposes a correspondence between physical effects associated with gravitating fields propagating in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and those of a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "the results in the literature suggest also the existence of a de sitter ( ds ) version of this conjecture which has a number of similarities with the ads / cft correspondence , although many details and interpretations remain to be clarified ( see @xcite for a recent review and a large set of references on these problems ) .    in view of these developments ,",
    "an examination of the classical solutions of gravitating fields in spacetimes with a cosmological constant seems appropriate .",
    "the case of a goldstone scalar field represents a particularly interesting model . gravitating global monopoles without a cosmological constant",
    "were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "these topological defects are predicted in unified theories and may appear in cosmological phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "the gravitating global monopoles have a negative mass and a deficit angle depending on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar goldstone field and the gravitational coupling . for sufficiently high enough values of the vev ,",
    "the solutions have a cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "these solutions were named ( after their string counterparts @xcite ) `` supermassive monopoles '' .    in @xcite and @xcite the basic features of global monopoles in both asymptotically ds and ads spacetimes have been studied .",
    "however , the issue of mass computation of these solutions has not been addressed in the literature , nor the question of cosmological configurations with a black hole event horizon .    in this paper , we reinvestigate global monopoles in ( a)ds space - time , special attention being paid to the solutions mass and action computation . for @xmath2 , we construct global monopoles in de sitter space in- and outside the cosmological horizon , which has to our knowledge not been done so far .",
    "in addition , we also study the corresponding cosmological solutions with a black hole horizon , which have up to now only been studied for @xmath0 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion of the status of no hair conjecture for solutions with a cosmological horizon ) .",
    "although the solutions we discuss are still asymptotically ( a)ds , their standard gravitational mass diverges , similar to the @xmath0 case",
    ". however , asymptotically ads solutions with a diverging adm mass have been considered recently by some authors , mainly for a scalar field in the bulk ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . in this case",
    "it was possible to relax the standard asymptotic conditions without loosing the original symmetries , but modifying the charges in order to take into account the presence of matter fields and to find a well - defined mass of the solutions .    in this paper",
    "we propose a similar mass computation for the case of a scalar field with a spontaneously broken internal @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "this is relevant especially for the case of a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the authors of @xcite conjectured that `` any asymptotic ds spacetime with mass greater than ds has a cosmological singularity '' , which is known in the literature as the _ maximal mass conjecture_. roughly speaking , it means that the conserved mass of any physically reasonable asymptotically ds spacetime must be negative ( @xmath4 less than the zero value of the pure ds@xmath5 spacetime ) . here",
    "we argue that this is valid for a rather limited set of ds boundary conditions , the ds global monopoles providing an explicit counterexample since their mass may take positive values .",

    "we find also that for small values of @xmath76 ( e.g. @xmath97 ) the evolution of the function @xmath89 with varying @xmath10 shows no occurrence of a pronounced local minimum .",

    "an important problem of ads space concerns the definition of action and conserved charges of asymptotically ads solutions . as concerning the mass ,",

    "this problem was addressed for the first time in the 1980s , with different approaches ( see for instance @xcite for a recent review ) .    in the brown - york approach @xcite ,",
    "one defines a quasilocal stress - tensor through the variation of the gravitational action @xmath133 the conserved charge associated with the time translation symmetry of the boundary metric is the mass of spacetime .",

    "also , the component @xmath160 of the boundary stress tensor decays too slow , @xmath161 , which implies a divergent mass , as computed according to ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "however , in such cases , it is still possible to obtain a finite mass and action by allowing @xmath162 to depend not only on the boundary metric @xmath163 , but also on the matter fields .",
    "this means that the quasilocal stress - energy tensor ( [ s1 ] ) also acquires a contribution coming from the matter fields .",
    "there are two main prescriptions for calculating these supplementary boundary counterterms .",
    "the first of these involves the asymptotic expansion of metric tensor and bulk matter fields near the boundary of spacetime .",
    "the matter counterterms are covariant expressions of fields living at the boundary which remove all divergencies of the on - shell action and give finite conserved charges .",
    "a systematic development of this method for bulk gravity coupled to scalar fields was given first in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a sufficient general matter counterterm action for the four dimensional solutions we consider here is given by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 , @xmath166 are polynomial functions of the goldstone scalar .",

    "the second method is based on the hamilton - jacobi formalism and was first applied in the ads / cft context in @xcite . in this approach , one takes into account the holographic principle of flows in the radial direction and defines conjugate momenta to the bulk field variables and the hamiltonian with respect to the ads radial coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "diffeomorphism invariance of the theory constrains the hamiltonian to vanish . to obtain the hamilton - jacobi equation one must rewrite the hamiltonian constraint in terms of functional derivatives of the on - shell action .",

    "the counterterms are determined by solving the hamilton - jacobi equation order by order in the metric expansion ( see @xcite for a review of this method ) .",
    "@xcite considered asymptotically ads solutions for a general bosonic action consisting in gravity coupled to a set of scalar and vector fields , in @xmath170-spacetime dimensions .",
    "the general form of the corresponding boundary counterterms was derived by using the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "the action principle in @xcite is general enough to contain ( [ action ] ) as a particular case .",
