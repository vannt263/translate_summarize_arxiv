    "psr j11196127 is a young , isolated radio pulsar discovered by @xcite with the parkes radio telescope in australia .",
    "its period ( @xmath2 s ) has a typical value observed for pulsars , but its period derivative ( @xmath3 ) is among the highest known .",
    "therefore the inferred surface ( dipole ) magnetic field strength is very large ( @xmath4 g ) , making this pulsar one of the `` high - magnetic field pulsars '' .",
    "this field strength is comparable to the so - called `` quantum critical field strength '' of @xmath5 g , because the dipole field there is twice as strong as the equatorial field @xmath6 . ]",
    "above which photon splitting may prevent pair production @xcite . because this pulsar does not rotate particularly rapidly , the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder ( @xmath7 g ) is high , but not as extreme as that of other pulsars . from its spin parameters",
    "one can further infer its characteristic age ( @xmath8 kyr ) , which makes its association with supernova remnant g292.2 - 0.5 likely @xcite .",
    "the high spin - down energy loss rate ( @xmath9 erg@xmath10 ) makes this source a promising target for the fermi @xmath11-ray satellite @xcite .",
    "hence it is one of the energetic pulsars which are currently monitored using the parkes radio telescope allowing the detection of possible @xmath11-ray pulsations @xcite . during these ( ongoing ) observations we noted that this pulsar has striking similarities with a group of neutron stars called rotating radio transients ( rrats ; @xcite ) and with the intermittent pulsars ( psr b1931 + 24 being the first discovered ; @xcite ) .",
    "this pulsar can therefore be seen , like psr b0656 + 14 @xcite , as an object that links different `` classes '' of neutron stars .",
    "we briefly introduce these different types of objects below .",
    "rrats are characterized by the sporadic nature of their emission .",
    "typically , detectable radio emission is observable for less than one second per day , causing standard periodicity searches to fail in detecting a periodic signal .",
    "therefore one has to rely on the greatest common divisor of the time between bursts to derive the underlying rotational period of the star .",
    "there are about forty reported rrats in the literature @xcite .",
    "many rrats have relatively long periods up to 7 s , suggesting these sources may be related to the radio - quiet x - ray populations of neutron stars , such as magnetars @xcite and isolated neutron stars @xcite , which are observed to have similar periods .",
    "the size of the rrat population is thought to be several times larger than the radio pulsar population @xcite , leading to inconsistencies with the observed supernova rate unless there is an evolutionary link between the neutron star classes @xcite .",
    "different ideas are put forward to explain the sporadic nature of detectable pulses , such as intermittent particle precipitation towards the star from a radiation belt similar to those in planetary magnetospheres @xcite or re - activation of the usually inactive vacuum gap due to in falling circumstellar asteroidal material @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that psr b0656 + 14 would have been classified as a rrat were it not one of the most nearby pulsars .",
    "one is therefore left with the question if psr b0656 + 14 should be called a rrat ? if not , it implies that at least some of the `` rrats '' are physically very similar to psr b0656 + 14 , except that they are more distant . in any case , it is clear that defining rrats to be pulsars that are not detectable via periodicity searches is insufficient and that one has to define the different neutron star classes based on physical properties instead ( e.g. @xcite ) .    based on the similarities between psr b0656 + 14 and the rrats",
    ", @xcite predicted that at least some of the rrats would show additional emission which is much weaker than their bright individual pulses and that when the individual bursts of rrats are averaged they will form a `` profile '' much broader than the individual bursts .",
    "indeed , for instance the rrat psr j0627 + 16 , which was found via its individual pulses , showed weak emission in a follow - up observation @xcite and the sum of the individual bursts of the rrat psr j18191458 produces a triple peaked pulse profile which is much wider than the individual bursts @xcite .",
    "the latter rrat shows a x - ray spectrum which is consistent with thermal emission from a cooling neutron star @xcite and , like psr b0656 + 14 , it shows x - ray pulsations @xcite . as will be discussed later in this paper , the peculiar emission properties of psrs j11196127 and b0656 + 14 might be linked to the erratic emission seen for other young and energetic pulsars , such as the vela pulsar and psr b170644 @xcite , thereby providing some generalization between the different phenomenon .    the final class of neutron stars we will discuss in the introduction are the intermittent pulsars .",
    "the archetype is psr b1931 + 24 @xcite , which is only active for a few days between periods of roughly a month during which the pulsar is not detectable .",
    "these sudden switches are accompanied by changes in the spin - down rate of the neutron star rotation , suggestive of significant changes in the torque generated by magnetospheric currents .",
    "it now has become clear that many more objects show pulse profile changes concurrent with changes in the spin - down rate @xcite and it has been suggested that all the so - called timing - noise could be ascribed to this effect . indeed the spin parameters of psr b1931 + 24 ( @xmath12 s and @xmath13 ) and other physical quantities such as @xmath14 g , @xmath15 erg@xmath10 and @xmath8 myr are not remarkable , supporting the idea that the correlated profile and spin - down switches could be very common in the pulsar population .",
    "it is therefore natural to extend this idea to all pulsars that switch off ( or change their profile ) on a regular basis during so - called `` nulls '' or `` mode changes '' .",
    "the nulls of some pulsars are very short ( a period or less ) , while others are only switched on for a few percent of the time ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the next sections we give some details about the observations ( sect .",
    "[ sctobservations ] ) and we will describe a transient profile change in sect .",

    "this is followed by the analysis of the individual pulses ( sect .",
    "[ sectsinglepulse ] ) , polarization ( sect .",
    "[ sectgeometry ] ) and pulsar timing behaviour ( sect .",
    "[ secttiming ] ) .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of the properties of psr j11196127 in the light of the different neutron star classes ( sect .",
    "[ sectdiscussion ] ) and the conclusions ( sect .",
    "[ sectconclusions ] ) .",
    "all the discussed observations were carried - out using the 64-m parkes radio telescope in australia and the majority of the data were obtained as part of the aforementioned timing program @xcite .",
    "this program started in april 2007 .",
    "each pulsar is typically observed once per month at 20  cm and twice per year at 10 and 50  cm , although this pulsar is only detected at 10 and 20  cm .",
    "the used receivers were the centre beam of the 20  cm multibeam receiver ( which has a bandwidth of 256  mhz and has a noise equivalent flux density of @xmath035 jy on a cold sky ) and the 10/50  cm receiver ( which has at 10  cm a bandwidth of 1024  mhz and has a noise equivalent flux density of @xmath049 jy on a cold sky ) .",
    "the data were on - line folded at the pulse period by a digital filterbank and were dumped every 30 seconds on hard disk . for details about the polarization calibration procedure and the used method to sum all the individual observations into a high signal - to - noise `` standard '' profile we refer to @xcite . for the majority of the observations",
    "the analogue filterbank was used to record the pulsar signal in parallel with a time resolution of 250 @xmath16s .",
    "although only total intensity is recorded it has the advantage that the data are not folded on - line , hence allowing the analysis of individual pulses .",
    "in addition we made use of archival parkes data recorded between and .",
    "for details about these observations we refer to @xcite in which some of these analogue filterbank data are published . together with data from our timing program up to , this results in a timing history of more than years .",
    "the pulse profile of psr j11196127 is well known to be single - peaked ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observation recorded in 2007 june 17 at 02:35:19 universal time therefore immediately triggered our interest in this object as it shows a clear double - peaked profile ( see fig .",
    "[ figdisp ] ) .",
    "despite years of trying we never observed a similar event again .",
    "hence , it was important to convince ourselves that the signal was pulsar related rather than caused by something instrumental or by terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "as one can see in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figdisp ] , both peaks of the pulse profile show an identical frequency dependent delay ( the gray horizontal bands are frequency channels affected by rfi and were excluded from the analysis ) .",
    "this frequency dependent delay is exactly the same as what is normally observed for this pulsar and can be perfectly explained in terms of dispersion by the interstellar medium .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the double - peaked structure is seen during the whole observation after folding at the known pulse period ( see right panel of fig . [ figdisp ] ) rules out rfi as the cause of the additional component .",
    "the signal was recorded using two independent digital filterbank backends and the recordings look identical as expected .",
    "all observations before and after this particular observation ( of different pulsars ) used an identical system set - up and do not show any sign of a similar effect .",
    "therefore the appearance of the additional component is clearly pulsar related .    with only one instance of the pulsar showing its double - peaked mode and no observation of an actual transition",
    "it is impossible to reliably estimate the occurrence rate of this transient phenomenon .",
    "the pulsar was double peaked during the whole 3 minutes of the observation and the observations 49 days earlier and 35 days later look normal , implying a total duration of the event of at least minutes , but shorter than months . in order to maximize the chance of catching the pulsar again during a similar event we substantially increased the observing duration ( up to half an hour ) in subsequent observing sessions . in total",
    "we have observed this pulsar times in between and , typically twice a day every month with a total duration of hours .",
    "in addition we inspected archival parkes data recorded between and .",
    "none of these additional observations ( with a total duration of hours ) shows a similar event .",
    "therefore the double - peaked mode is clearly very rare as it is only seen in of the inspected data .",
    "_ top panel : _ averaged pulse profile of a single 22 minutes long observation at a wavelength of 20 cm .",
    "the time resolution is reduced to 200 bins across the pulse period and the peak of the profile is put at pulse longitude @xmath17 . _",
    "bottom panel : _ the strong ( non - consecutive ) individual pulses observed during the same observation .",
    "notice that at the pulse longitude of the bright individual pulses there is no integrated power visible , which is reminiscent of the emission of rrats.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    at first glance this pulsar is not a promising source to analyse its individual pulses because it is quite weak ( the average single - pulse signal - to - noise is less than 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , careful investigation by eye of all the observations for which we had single - pulse recordings available revealed a handful of strong pulses . in total only four pulses at an observing wavelength of 20 cm were strong enough to be clearly detectable ( see fig .",
    "[ figstrongpulses ] ) .",
    "they all occurred during a 22 minutes long observation recorded at 2007 august 20 , starting at 22:11:05 ut .",
    "strong pulses were visible only in one of the observations ( with a total duration of hours ) for which we have single - pulse data ( and which were not too badly affected by rfi ) .",
    "in other words , only during 4 of the inspected neutron star rotations the intensity of the radio beam was strong enough to be detectable with the parkes telescope . assuming a constant event rate for the occurrence of strong pulses , poisson statistics predicts an extremely low probability of that four ( or more ) pulses occur during a single 3211 pulse period long observation by pure chance .",
    "this strongly suggests that the event rate must have been much higher during that particular observation .    _",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    looking at fig . [ figstrongpulses ] , one can see that the strong individual pulses all occur @xmath19 in pulse longitude earlier than the peak of the normal profile .",
    "surprisingly , at the pulse longitudes one can detect individual pulses , the integrated profile does not show significant emission .",
    "this is a defining characteristic of rrats , as it implies that this kind of emission can not be detected using standard periodicity searches . to prove this point",
    ", we took the observation with the four strong pulses and replaced the emission within the pulse longitude range corresponding to the normal emission with gaussian noise with a root mean square ( rms ) equal to the off - pulse rms . the spectrum based on this time - series",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figspectrum ] , while the spectrum including the normal emission is shown in the top panel .",
    "one can clearly see that the fundamental frequency ( 2.45 hz ) and the higher harmonics are only visible when the normal emission is included . despite the strongest pulses are observed in the leading component , the underlying periodicity ( or the underlying emission itself ) is not detectable at those pulse longitudes . therefore the leading component can be qualified to have rrat - like emission , although as will be discussed later , there are also important differences .",
    "relativetoaveragepulse23 2018 mjy 200.6 jy the strongest of the four detected pulses is relativetoaveragepulse times brighter than the average pulse of the normal emission during the same observation .",
    "assuming the normal emission of the pulsar was not abnormally bright or weak during that particular observation ( and there is no reason to believe so based on the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulse profile of that observation compared to others ) , this corresponds to 20 averaged out over a whole pulse period ( using the published mean flux density of 0.80 mjy at 1400 mhz by @xcite ) or a peak flux density of 20 using the full single - pulse width of @xmath20 .    to investigate",
    "how `` normal '' the radio emission in the main - peak following the rrat - like component of psr j11196127 is , we attempted to calculate the modulation index for this pulsar .",
    "the modulation index is independent of the observing system and quantifies the broadness of an amplitude distribution .",
    "it is defined to be @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the standard deviation of the observed pulse intensities , @xmath23 is the average pulse intensity and @xmath24 is the total number of stellar rotations observed .",
    "this quantity can be calculated as function of pulse longitude by considering the intensities at a specific longitude rather than the pulse intensities integrated over pulse longitude .",
    "we have chosen to calculate the modulation index in the fourier domain instead , which as explained by @xcite allows a correction for interstellar scintillation .",
    "it turned out that the signal - to - noise ratio in an individual observation is not high enough to detect a significant modulation index . to circumvent this problem",
    "we have added together all the individual pulse recording at a wavelength of 20 cm . in order to do this",
    "the average off - pulse intensity of each observation was subtracted , the data were re - sampled to have an equal number of bins across the pulse period and the intensities were scaled to make the off - pulse rms equal to 1 ( thereby assuming that the system temperature was the same for all observations ) .",
    "the individual observations were then aligned by cross - correlating their pulse profiles with an analytic template based on von mises functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting pulse stack is based on more than 28 hours of data and shows a modulation index of @xmath25 in the centre of the profile , flaring up at the edges .",
    "it is likely that the modulation index is slightly lower in reality because the addition process can add some artificial variations to the signal .",
    "nevertheless , the modulation index of psr j11196127 is entirely consistent to those observed for most pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) .      _",
    "top panel : _ pulse profile of a single 6 minute observation at a wavelength of 10 cm .",

    "it must be noted that the combination of a high dispersion measure , worse system temperature , smaller band width and a much higher sky temperature might well be preventing us from detecting the pulsar at 50  cm . because the individual pulses were not always recorded at those wavelengths , there are only two individual pulse recordings available at 10  cm .",
    "one of these recordings , the 6 minute long 2007 july 23 observation , showed a number of clearly detected bright individual pulses ( bottom panel fig .",
    "[ figstrongpulses10 cm ] ) , while a 4 minute long 2009 august 9 observation does not show any sign of similar pulses .",
    "the strong pulses appear to occur at three distinct pulse longitudes ( approximately at @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "notice that the pulse profile of this particular observation shows structure at these pulse longitudes associated with the strong individual pulses ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ figstrongpulses10 cm ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the strong pulses appear before and after the main peak of the observation .",
    "the relative alignment of this profile with respect to the single - peaked and double - peaked profile observed at a wavelength of 20  cm will be discussed in the next section in more detail . in total",
    "there are 10word observations at a wavelength of 10  cm for which we have an integrated pulse profile and this observation is the only one which shows evidence for additional components in the pulse profile . the fact that the strong pulses do have corresponding peaks in the pulse profile suggests that at this frequency ( or possibly epoch ) the strong pulses are less rrat - like than the strong pulses observed at a wavelength of 20  cm .",
    "independent of whether single pulses occurred in one of the two , or 10word , of the 10-cm observations , given how rare the detection of individual pulses is at a wavelength of 20  cm and the fact that at 10  cm more individual pulses are detected suggests that strong pulses occur more often at higher frequencies .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there are no individual pulses detected in two 3 minute observations made at a wavelength of 20  cm one day earlier and two days later .",
    "only if the event rate is high for periods of time less than a day and we have been lucky during the observation at a wavelength of 10  cm the event rates could be the same at the two frequencies .",
    "it is not immediately obvious which of the two components of the double - peaked profile corresponds to the single - peaked profile and therefore it is not clear if and how the newly emerged component relates to the rrat - like emission . in principle",
    "one could use pulsar timing methods to resolve this issue , but , as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ secttiming ] , a large amplitude glitch makes this impossible .",
    "we therefore have to resort to other measurements to find out how to time align the normal single - peaked pulse profile and the double - peaked profile .",
    "we will show in the this section that the position angle ( pa ) of the linear polarization can be used to find this relative alignment .",
    "polarization data are further used to constrain the viewing geometry and the radio emission height .",
    "virtually all pulsars with @xmath29 ergs@xmath30 have a linear polarization fraction over 50% ( @xcite ; see also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , most of these pulsars show a pa which varies smoothly as a function of pulse longitude forming a s - shape .",
    "this pulsar is no exception as one can see in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ paswings ] .",
    "the middle panel shows the double - peaked profile .",
    "notice that the pa values of the pulsar in its normal mode clearly match those of the leading peak of the double - peaked profile , suggesting that the trailing peak is the component which has appeared in the double - peaked mode .",
    "indeed a cross - correlation between the two profiles shows the highest degree of correlation for such an alignment .",
    "this is caused by the slight asymmetry seen for the profiles . in the single - peaked mode",
    "the trailing side of the profile is slightly steeper caused by a weak emission component overlapping with the leading edge of the main peak ( visible at @xmath31 pulse longitude ) .",
    "the leading component in the double - peaked mode has also a shallower leading edge , although in that case there is no evidence for a weak component being responsible .",
    "from the fact that the pa curve is very similar in the single- and double - peaked mode one can conclude that the pa provides a much stronger foundation to base the alignment of the two profiles on than the total intensity . in order to quantify the relative alignment of the two profiles",
    "we have fitted the data using the rotating vector model ( rvm ; @xcite ) . in this model the pa of the linear polarization",
    "@xmath32 depends on the pulse longitude @xmath33 via @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the pa and pulse longitude at the location where the @xmath37 has its steepest gradient ( and an inflection point ) .",
    "in addition , the shape of the pa curve depends on the emission geometry of the pulsar , which is described by two angles .",
    "firstly the angle @xmath38 between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis and secondly the angle @xmath39 between the line - of - sight and the rotation axis .",
    "a related angle is the impact parameter @xmath40 , which is the angle between the line - of - sight and the magnetic axis at its closest approach .    according to the rvm",
    ", @xmath36 corresponds to the pulse longitude at which the line - of - sight intersects the fiducial plane , the plane containing the rotation and magnetic axis .",
    "there is a longitude - shift one has to take into account if the emission height @xmath41 is not negligible compared to the light cylinder distance , as will be discussed later .",
    "the longitude @xmath36 could act as a natural zero point for the pulse longitude scale if one uses the pa to align different profiles .",
    "this is achieved by determining @xmath36 by fitting eq .",
    "[ eqrvm ] through the pa points .",
    "the profiles are then rotated such that the @xmath36 corresponds to @xmath17 in the plots of fig .",
    "[ paswings ] .",
    "note that the alignment is independent of the actual value of the pa , it only depends on the pulse longitude corresponding with the steepest gradient of the rvm curve .",
    "this allows a self - consistency check of the determined alignment by over - plotting the rvm curve obtained from the fit of the double - peaked profile on the pa points of the single - peaked profile .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ paswings ] that this rvm curve matches both pa curves perfectly , something which is also evident from the right - hand panel which shows the pa points of the two profiles overplotted .",

    "the peak intensities of the profiles are normalized.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    now that the single - peaked profile is aligned with the double - peaked profile , the leading rrat - like component can be placed on the same longitude scale by aligning the main peaks .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figthreecomponents ] , which shows both the sum of the four strong pulses observed at 20  cm ( dotted line ) and the double - peaked profile ( thick gray line ) at the same wavelength .",
    "the strong pulses represent a distinct profile component with a pulse longitude separation from the main peak roughly equal to that between the main peak and the transient trailing peak of the double - peaked profile .",
    "the remaining question is how the components seen in the 10-cm observation discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect10 cm ] fit in this picture .",
    "the profile is far too weak to find the pulse longitude at which the gradient of the pa curve is steepest .",
    "nevertheless , the value of the pa can be used to roughly align the profile to the pa curve observed at 20 cm .",
    "it follows that the main peak of the 10-cm profile overlaps roughly with the single - peaked profile observed at 20 cm . in fig .",
    "[ figthreecomponents ] the 10-cm profile is shown together with the double - peaked profile and the rrat - like component seen at 20 cm .",
    "this alignment suggests that the bright pulses at the far leading edge of the 10-cm profile correspond with the rrat - like component seen at 20 cm ( dotted line ) .",
    "the strong pulses seen at 10 cm at the far trailing edge of the profile appear to form another profile component , again with a similar component separation as between the other components .",
    "it should be emphasized that because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of the 10-cm profile , its alignment with the other profiles should only be considered as a rough indication .",
    "we therefore believe that although the pulse profile of psr j11196127 is most of the time single - peaked , there are in fact at least four components .",
    "in addition to the normal emission , the profile has shown once a transient trailing peak .",
    "these two peaks are flanked by two rrat - like components which are usually inactive .",
    "the single - peaked profile does not perfectly match the leading component of the double - peaked profile as shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ paswings ] .",
    "there is no a priori reason why they should match better , given that the shapes of the profiles are slightly different to start off with . on the other hand , there are reasons for the alignment of the profiles not to be perfect",
    ". if the emission height is different in the two states of the pulsar , which potentially could be the root - cause of the different profile shapes , one does expect a deviation in the alignment of the profiles .",
    "this is because only for a zero emission height @xmath36 corresponds to the pulse longitude at which the line of sight is passing the fiducial plane . for finite emission heights co - rotation of the emitting region makes the inflection point of the pa curve ( @xmath36 ) to be delayed with respect to the pulse profile .",
    "the relative shift @xmath42 between the pulse profile and the inflection point of the pa curve relates to the emission height @xmath41 via ( @xcite ) @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the spin period of the pulsar , @xmath45 is the speed of light and @xmath46 is the light cylinder radius ( 19,500 km for this pulsar ) .",
    "therefore , if the emission heights are different in the single- and double - peaked modes , the pulse profiles will not be perfectly aligned when using the inflection point of the pa as the reference point .",
    ".[emissionheighttable]this table summarizes the considered choices for the location of the magnetic axis with respect to the pulse profiles of psr j11196127 .",
    "the second and third column denotes those longitudes in the single- and double - peaked mode respectively using the longitude shown used in fig .",
    "[ paswings ] .",
    "the next three columns indicate the implied emission height difference between the two modes and the emission heights themselves .",
    "the last column states which component of the double - peaked profile is the new component . in case ii the single - peaked profile splits into two components . both cases i and iv are argued to be plausible , case iv being our preferred solution .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , < , > , < \" , ]     the modulation index for selected sources can be found in table [ modindextable ] .",
    "one can see that the modulation index of the normal emission of psr j11196127 is typical for that of radio pulsars .",
    "unfortunately , the lower limit of the modulation index of the rrat - like emission of psr j11196127 is not much higher than that of the normal emission , and therefore it is consistent with all types of emission . to improve",
    "this limit one needs to use an instrument which is much more sensitive than parkes , such as the ska . on the other hand",

    "we found that the young high - magnetic field pulsar j11196127 exhibits three types of pulsar behaviour .",
    "it has an `` intermittent '' profile peak trailing the peak associated with `` normal '' emission and these profile components are flanked by two much more erratic components , which can be argued to be `` rrat - like '' .",
    "both the erratic components and the intermittent component are observed around the same epoch and appear to be transient events .",
    "it can therefore not be ruled out that they represent different phases of the on- and off - switching process , possibly related to regions on the polar cap which usually fail in producing the positron - electron pairs required for the emission mechanism to work .",
    "nevertheless the overall profile symmetry suggests that the more steady components are located in the centre of the beam and the more flickering components at the edges .",
    "this is consistent with the `` edge effect '' , which states that in general the emission is more erratic at the edges of the profile components .",
    "some of the rrats might therefore be pulsars for which the line - of - sight misses the part of the beam with more steady emission .",
    "both the intermittent and rrat - like events are very rare and are preceded by a large amplitude glitch that occurred directly before these phenomenon were observed .",
    "this is the first time that a glitch , or the post - glitch recovery process , is observed to influence the radio emission process of a normal ( non - rrat ) pulsar .",
    "the glitch was followed by a post - glitch behaviour which is very unusual for the pulsar population as a whole , but it is similar to that observed for one of the rrats ( psr j18191458 ) . after the glitch ,",
    "the spin - down rate relaxed to a smaller value than the projected pre - glitch value .",
    "we interpret this as an increase of the effective moment of inertia produced by an excessive number of unpinning vortices . by considering this anomaly and the emission changes observed ,",
    "we believe that the glitch may have been triggered by magnetic reconfigurations .",
    "although we measure a braking index @xmath1 , glitches like the one reported here make the effective braking index larger .",
    "nevertheless , the evolutionary track of psr  j11196127 in the @xmath48 diagram may lead it towards the rrat population rather than the bulk of the normal pulsars .",
    "the occurrence - rate of rrat - like pulses must have been higher around the glitch epoch ( as is claimed for j18191458 ) , suggesting a link with the glitch - recovery process .",
    "more precise , the rrat - like pulses were observed during the initial fast recovery ( on a timescale of @xmath49 days ) rather than the later slow recovery ( on a timescale of @xmath50 days ) .",
    "this allows the possibility that rrat - like activity is in general low for young , high - magnetic field pulsars ( except after a glitch ) and increases when pulsars age .    like psr b0656 + 14 , which would be classified as a rrat",
    "were it more distant , psr j11196127 provides a link between the known neutron star population and the rrats .",
    "additional links could be other young pulsars which show `` giant micro - pulses '' , the magnetar population which show psr b0656 + 14-like spiky emission and pulsars with extreme long null lengths .",
    "it appears that rrats represents a corner in the @xmath48 diagram in which the pulsars have the most erratic emission .",
    "we argue that the modulation index is a good measure of how rrat - like the emission is .",
    "the modulation quantifies the broadness of the pulse energy distribution and is ( unlike for instance the `` intermittency ratio '' or the `` r - parameter '' ) independent of the sensitivity of the telescope or observation duration . for rrats ( which are not detected in a periodicity search ) one can only derive a lower limit .",
    "this limit is estimated to be @xmath51 for the rrat psr j18191458 , which although high for pulsar standards is not necessarily higher than that observed for magnetars .",
    "additional observations could place stronger limits on how high the modulation index of rrat emission is and can potentially be used to distinguish between the different sub - classes of the rrats .",
    "not only are the strong individual pulses of psr j11196127 reminiscent of those of other young pulsars , but so is the shape of its pulse profile in its double - peaked mode .",
    "the similarity with other `` energetic wide - beam pulsar '' suggests that the magnetic axis is located in between the two components .",
    "the derived emission height for that scenario is @xmath0500 km , somewhat higher than that derived for other young pulsars . thereby suggesting a relatively aligned geometry ( @xmath52 ) , or",
    "slightly more aligned if only part of the open field line region is ever active .",
