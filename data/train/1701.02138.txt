    "gravitational instability is one of the engines behind the dynamics of disc galaxies , where it enters a variety of processes : from the formation of stars ( elmegreen 2012 ) , globular clusters ( kruijssen 2014 ) and giant molecular clouds ( dobbs et al .",
    "2014 ) to the formation and evolution of spiral structure ( bertin 2014 ) and bars ( athanassoula 2013 ; sellwood 2014 ) . today",
    ", several decades after the pioneering work of lin & shu ( 1966 ) and the seminal papers by jog & solomon ( 1984a , b ) , it is widely accepted that cold interstellar gas plays an important role in disc instabilities even though it contributes little to the self - gravity of the disc .",
    "it is also well known that the colder the gas , i.e.  the lower its 1d velocity dispersion @xmath0 , the higher its impact on the onset of such instabilities ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; rafikov 2001 ) . thus @xmath0 is a quantity of great importance not only for the interstellar gas itself , but also for the dynamics of galactic discs ( mogotsi et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "ngc 6946 provides an eloquent example of how radically @xmath0 can affect the onset of gravitational instabilities in galaxy discs , and how drastically @xmath0 is approximated in stability analyses ( ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ; romeo & fathi 2015 ) .",
    "in particular , ferguson et al .  ( 1998 ) showed that if one assumes @xmath3 , the classical value motivated by kennicutt ( 1989 ) , then this galaxy turns out to be unstable up to the edge of the optical disc , while using a radial profile of @xmath0 derived from observations yields stability across the entire disc !",
    "martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) pointed out that radial variation in @xmath0 remains controversial because such measurements demand both high angular resolution and high brightness sensitivity , requirements not met by most observations .",
    "fortunately , recent co and hi galaxy surveys ( bima song , heracles and things ) have provided high - quality measurements of molecular and atomic gas kinematics , which allow deriving reliable radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( e.g. , tamburro et al .",

    "2015 ; romeo & fathi 2015 ; mogotsi et al .",
    "2016 ; romeo & fathi 2016 ) . in particular , romeo & fathi ( 2015 ) analysed ngc 6946 in detail and showed that the observed radial variation of @xmath1 has indeed a significant impact on disc instabilities .",
    "does the observed radial variation of @xmath1 , or that of @xmath2 , have a significant impact on disc instabilities even in other galaxies ?",
    "if so , how does the new instability scenario differ from the classical one ? to explore this important aspect of the problem , we consider a large sample of nearby star - forming spirals and use the newest - generation radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 available for that sample ( mogotsi et al .",
    "2016 ) , together with the disc instability diagnostics developed by romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) .",
    "such diagnostics follow from rigorous stability analyses ( romeo 1985 ; bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo 1990 , 1992 , 1994 ) , they are more general than the effective @xmath4 parameter proposed by romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) and as easy to use .",
    "using such diagnostics one can measure the local stability level of galaxy discs and the size of the regions over which gravitational instabilities develop , and one can also predict which gas or stellar component drives the instability process . this has been illustrated in a variety of applications ( e.g. , genzel et al .",

    "in this paper , we consider not only molecular and atomic gas but also a component that is still often disregarded when analysing the stability of spiral galaxies : the stars !",
    "the data and method are described in sect .  2 ,",
    "the results are presented in sect .  3 and discussed in sect .  4 , and",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "we consider a sample of nearby star - forming spirals that was previously analysed by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , hereafter l08 , and romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) among others : ngc 628 , 2841 , 3184 , 3198 , 3351 , 3521 , 4736 , 5055 , 5194 , 6946 and 7331 .",
    "these are galaxies with sensitive and spatially resolved measurements across the entire optical disc , which l08 selected from the following surveys : the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ; helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) , the hera co - line extragalactic survey ( heracles ; leroy et al .",
    "2009 ) , the _ sirtf _",
    "/ spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) and the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ; walter et al .",
    "we refer to l08 for a detailed description of the data and their translation into physical quantities ( see their sect .  3 ) .",
    "following romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) , we treat all the molecular gas , atomic gas and stars as three distinct components and use the same epicyclic frequency ( @xmath5 ) , surface densities ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and stellar radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) as in l08 ( see their appendices a  c and e  f ) .",
    "however , rather than using observationally motivated values of the co and hi 1d ( line - of - sight ) velocity dispersions , we use observed radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which we describe in sect",
    "note two points concerning our notation :    * @xmath6 denotes the _ total _ surface density of molecular hydrogen+helium gas , as traced by co emission ( our @xmath6 = l08 s @xmath10 ) . *",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath9 denote _ dynamically different _ quantities .",
    "to first approximation , molecular gas and atomic gas are collisional so their velocity dispersions are isotropic ( see , e.g. , bertin 2014 ) .",
    "this is true even considering the effects of gas turbulence and stellar feedback ( grisdale et al .",
    "in contrast , the stellar component is collisionless and has an anisotropic velocity dispersion ( see again bertin 2014 ) .",
    "mogotsi et al .  (",
    "2016 ) used co @xmath11 and hi data from the heracles and things surveys to derive high - quality radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all but three spirals of our sample ( ngc 3521 , 5194 and 7331 ) .",
    "such profiles are computed from 13  co and hi velocity dispersion maps , averaged azimuthally over 13  rings where emission from _ both _ co _ and _ hi is detected ( see sect .  2 of mogotsi et al .",
    "2016 for a detailed description of the data and method ) .",
    "while the radial range of @xmath12 is hardly affected by the constraint above , the radial range of @xmath13 is clearly limited by the absence of co emission in the outer regions of the optical disc .",
    "but this is not a significant limitation for our stability analysis because in those regions @xmath2 is approximately constant : @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the optical radius ( l08 ) .",
    "we estimate the error bars of @xmath12 and @xmath13 using the traditional formula ( l08 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the uncertainty in a quantity @xmath19 averaged over a tilted ring , rms is the root - mean - square scatter within the tilted ring , and @xmath20 is the number of resolution elements in the ring ( i.e.  the number of pixels in the ring where there are detections divided by the number of pixels per resolution element ) .",
    "ngc 3521 , ngc 5194 and ngc 7331 are not part of the galaxy sample analysed by mogotsi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) . however , there are heracles and things data available for these spirals .",
    "ngc 5194 was not in the original list of heracles galaxies ( leroy et al .",
    "2009 ) , but co @xmath11 observations were made in the final survey ( 2011 ) .",
    "for this galaxy , we derive 13  co and hi velocity dispersion maps following the procedure described in sect .  2 of mogotsi et al .",
    "in addition , we mask out spurious emission in the co data using the heracles moment-0 map .",
    "we then compute radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by averaging azimuthally over 13  rings where both co and hi have filling factors larger than 10% , as in mogotsi et al .",
    "finally , we estimate the error bars of @xmath12 and @xmath13 using eq .",
    "ngc 3521 and ngc 7331 have high inclinations ( @xmath21 ) and lower co velocity resolutions than the other galaxies ( @xmath22 )",
    ". therefore velocity profiles from their central regions are strongly affected by beam smearing and other projection effects , which cause artificial profile broadening and asymmetric profile shapes .",
    "simple gaussian fits to those profiles can not be used to determine velocity dispersions accurately .",
    "we identify profiles that are strongly affected by those effects by imposing a cut - off of 5 kms@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) on the fitted velocity dispersion uncertainties , and removing all pixels with uncertainties larger than this cut - off value .",
    "we then compute @xmath12 , @xmath13 and estimate their error bars following the same procedure as for ngc 5194 .    before making use of all the @xmath25 radial profiles discussed above , we need to interpolate /",
    "extrapolate them so as to match the radial sampling / range of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which were derived using a conceptually distinct method ( l08 ) .",
    "we do simple linear interpolation and constant extrapolation of logarithmically scaled data : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a logarithmic scale is quite natural since @xmath12 and @xmath13 vary significantly in the inner regions of the optical disc ( mogotsi et al .",
    "this data representation also eliminates the need for higher - order interpolation / extrapolation schemes , which are riskier ( see , e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "1 shows the original and the interpolated / extrapolated radial profiles of @xmath1 for each spiral of our sample , as well as two representative values of @xmath1 motivated and used in previous stability analyses : @xmath30 , which is the value motivated by kennicutt ( 1989 ) and wilson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) among others , and the one used by romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) ; and @xmath31 , which was motivated and used by l08 .",
    "also shown , as shaded regions , are the radial ranges where @xmath32 ( this is the working sensitivity adopted by l08 ) .",
    "1 illustrates that @xmath12 rises towards the centre in most of the galaxies .",
    "note that this is an order - of - magnitude effect for spirals like ngc 3351 , 4736 , 5055 and 6946 !",
    "this form of disc heating is a natural consequence of radial inflow and is mediated by local gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , zhang 1998 ; griv et al .  2002 ;",
    "romeo et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; agertz et al .  2009 ; forbes et al .  2014 ; goldbaum et al .  2015",
    "; romeo & fathi 2015 ; goldbaum et al .",
    "2016 ) . although there are still open questions , the basic idea behind this process is simple , and is beautifully illustrated in sect .",
    "7.1 of kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) .",
    "radial inflow increases both @xmath33 and @xmath5 , but @xmath33 ` wins ' and the toomre ( 1964 ) parameter @xmath34 decreases . as @xmath4 drops below a critical value of order unity , local gravitational instabilities set in and increase @xmath0 , thus heating the disc .",
    "1 also illustrates that our simple linear interpolation is good enough because most of the galaxies have good enough radial sampling , and because we have chosen the ` right ' data representation .",
    "constant extrapolation is also good enough because @xmath12 and @xmath26 have similar radial ranges in most of the galaxies .",
    "2 shows a similar outcome for @xmath13 , except for the long series of extrapolated data in the outer regions of the optical disc .",
    "this arises from a mismatch between the radial ranges of @xmath13 and @xmath27 , which in turn is caused by the conceptually distinct methods used by mogotsi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and l08 for deriving these radial profiles , as explained in the first and third paragraphs of this section .",
    "note , however , that our simple constant extrapolation produces @xmath14 for @xmath35 in most of the galaxies , consistent with the result found by l08 .",
    "our stability analysis will not significantly suffer from this data extrapolation for two reasons : ( i ) however non - optimal , using our radial profiles of @xmath13 is better than just using a single value of @xmath2 across the entire optical disc of every galaxy in the sample , as commonly done ; and ( ii ) we will focus on the stability properties of the whole galaxy sample , rather than of each galaxy .",
    "we use two disc instability diagnostics derived by romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) .",
    "* the first diagnostic is a simple and accurate approximation for the @xmath4 stability parameter in multi - component and realistically thick discs : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of gas and/or stellar components , @xmath38 is the toomre parameter of component @xmath39 ( remember that @xmath0 denotes the radial velocity dispersion ) , @xmath40 is a factor that encapsulates the stabilizing effect of disc thickness for the whole range of velocity dispersion anisotropy ( @xmath41 ) observed in galactic discs , and @xmath42 is a weight factor . @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    "are given by @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the component with smallest @xmath46 : @xmath47 * the second diagnostic is a corresponding approximation for the characteristic instability scale , i.e.  the perturbation wavelength at which the disc becomes locally unstable as @xmath48 drops below unity : @xmath49 where @xmath45 is defined by eq .",
    "this set of equations tells us that the values of @xmath48 and @xmath50 are controlled by the component with smallest @xmath46 .",
    "this is the component that drives disc instabilities : @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "all other components have less weight because their contributions are weakened by factors @xmath53 ; the more @xmath54 differs from @xmath55 , the smaller @xmath42 . note that while @xmath56 ensures stability against axisymmetric perturbations , larger values of @xmath48 ( 23 ) are required to stabilize the disc against non - axisymmetric perturbations ( e.g. , griv & gedalin 2012 ) and gas dissipation ( elmegreen 2011 ) .    to compute the radial profiles of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 in our case ) , we need to specify @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; the radial profiles of all basic quantities have already been specified ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "following romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) , we adopt constant @xmath63 , as is natural for collisional components , and a constant @xmath64 , as was assumed by l08 .",
    "hence @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "stability parameter for the whole sample of spirals , with the galactocentric distance measured in units of the optical radius . also shown is the local median of @xmath57",
    ". note that while @xmath67 ensures stability against axisymmetric perturbations , larger values of @xmath57 ( 23 ) are required to stabilize the disc against non - axisymmetric perturbations and gas dissipation .",
    "the precise value of the critical stability level is still questioned ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "the data are colour - coded so as to show whether disc instabilities are driven by stars , atomic or molecular gas . ]         and @xmath9 are the radial velocity dispersions of molecular gas and stars , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are their toomre parameters . outside the ` two - phase region ' , the responses of the two components to perturbations are coupled .",
    "so star - driven instabilities can also lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas . ]",
    "3 shows the three - component @xmath70 stability parameter as a function of galactocentric distance for our sample of spirals .",
    "also shown is the local median of @xmath57 , @xmath71 , computed by binning the data in 12 rings of width @xmath72 .",
    "this apparently simple plot encloses two layers of information .",
    "the first layer is well known : the stability level of nearby star - forming spirals is , on average , remarkably flat and well above unity ( e.g. , l08 ; romeo & falstad 2013 ) . in fact , the local median of @xmath57 varies within the range @xmath73 , and globally @xmath74 ( global median @xmath75 scatter ) .",
    "remember that @xmath67 ensures stability against axisymmetric perturbations , while larger values of @xmath57 ( @xmath76 ) are required to stabilize the disc against non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "unfortunately , there is still no general consensus about the value of @xmath77 .",
    "for example , griv & gedalin ( 2012 ) found that the classical estimate @xmath78 is an absolute upper limit on the critical stability level .",
    "elmegreen ( 2011 ) showed that gas dissipation has a similar destabilizing effect , and estimated that @xmath79 .",
    "if one assumes this local stability threshold , then nearby star - forming spirals are close to marginal instability or unstable , given that 53% of the data fall within the range @xmath80 and that @xmath81 in 26% of the cases .",
    "the second layer of information is deeper and can only be extracted by using the romeo - falstad disc instability diagnostics .",
    "it concerns the component that drives gravitational instability , which has important dynamical implications , as we discuss below .",
    "4 is the _ key plot _ of our paper .",
    "it illustrates that using observed radial profiles of @xmath1 , rather than observationally motivated values of @xmath1 , has a strong impact on the inferred scale of gravitational instabilities in nearby star - forming spirals .",
    "let us first see what a @xmath30 analysis predicts .",
    "remember that this is the value of @xmath1 motivated by kennicutt ( 1989 ) , martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) and wilson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) among others , and the one used by romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the three - component characteristic instability scale as a function of galactocentric distance for our sample of spirals .",
    "the colour coding tells us which component drives gravitational instability : molecular gas , atomic gas or stars . note ( i )",
    "that disc instabilities are driven by the stars in 82% of the cases , but molecular gas is nevertheless an important driver of gravitational instability in the inner disc ; ( ii ) that the distribution of @xmath82 is bimodal for @xmath83 ; and ( iii ) that there is an order - of - magnitude gap in @xmath58 between regimes driven by the molecular gas ( a few 100 pc ) and regimes driven by the stars ( a few kpc ) .",
    "what does our analysis predict instead ? see the right panel of fig .",
    "the rise of @xmath12 towards the centre results in a paradigm shift .",
    "disc instabilities are now entirely driven by the stars at kpc scales ( @xmath84 ) , with two notable exceptions : the inner discs of ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 ( 2% of the data ) .",
    "these are the sample galaxies with highest surface density of molecular gas averaged over the inner disc ( @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) , and highest star formation rate ( @xmath87 ; see table 4 of l08 , or table 1 of walter et al .",
    "these are also active galaxies , where molecular gas plays a key role as fuel in the activity process ( e.g. , krips et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "can star - driven instabilities lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas ? to answer this question , we should understand in more detail how molecular gas and stars contribute to disc instabilities .",
    "this important piece of information is illustrated in fig .",
    "consider a two - component disc of molecular gas and stars , and perturb it with axisymmetric waves of frequency @xmath88 and wavenumber @xmath89 .",
    "the response of the disc is basically described by the jog - solomon ( 1984a ) dispersion relation , @xmath90 .",
    "inside the ` two - phase region ' shown in fig .  5 , @xmath90 has two distinct minima ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) . in the ` gaseous phase ' ,",
    "the minimum at short wavelengths ( @xmath91 ) is lower than the other one and molecular gas will drive the onset of gravitational instability .",
    "vice versa , in the ` stellar phase ' , the long - wavelength minimum is lower and stars will drive instability .",
    "the shape and size of this region are only moderately affected by disc thickness ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) , gas turbulence ( hoffmann & romeo 2012 ) or the fact that the stellar component is collisionless ( romeo & falstad 2013 ) . in the rest of the parameter plane , @xmath90 has a single minimum , where the dynamical responses of the two components are strongly coupled .",
    "this means that any instability driven by one of the components will also perturb and destabilize the other .",
    "in particular , star - driven instabilities will lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas .",
    "this is clearly the case for almost the entire galaxy sample , as almost the entire data set falls outside the two - phase region .",
    "the inner discs of ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 are again exceptions to the general rule . but",
    "instabilities in such discs are driven by the molecular gas ( see discussion of fig .  4 ) , so they will naturally lead to its collapse or fragmentation .",
    "are ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 true outliers ?",
    "the condition that disc instabilities are driven by stars , rather than molecular gas , is @xmath92 ( see sect .  2.2 and remember that @xmath6 denotes the total surface density of molecular gas , helium included ) . as pointed out in sect .  3 , this condition",
    "is not fulfilled by the inner discs of ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 . on the other hand ,",
    "it turns out that if @xmath93 were 27% smaller , or if @xmath94 were 37% larger ( @xmath95 ) , then gravitational instabilities in such discs would be driven by the stars , as in the rest of the galaxy sample .",
    "can systematic uncertainties account for that ?",
    "let us discuss this point below .",
    "it is well known that the surface densities of molecular gas and stars are subject to significant systematic uncertainties via the adopted co - to-@xmath96 conversion factor , @xmath97 , and stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath98 ( see , e.g. , binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "l08 adopted @xmath99 .",
    "this is the standard value recommended by bolatto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the discs of normal solar - metallicity galaxies , and has an uncertainty of @xmath1000.3dex ( a factor of 2 ) .",
    "sandstrom et al .",
    "( 2013 ) carried out one of the most comprehensive extragalactic study of @xmath97 to date , and found an average value of @xmath97 that is 30% smaller than the standard one : @xmath101 , again with an uncertainty of @xmath1000.3dex .",
    "this value of @xmath97 is small enough to move the inner discs of ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 into star - driven instability regimes ! concerning the stellar mass - to - light ratio , l08 adopted @xmath102 .",
    "this is near the mean @xmath103-band @xmath104 ratio expected for these galaxies ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , and has an uncertainty of @xmath1000.10.2dex ( a factor of 1.31.6 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath105 would be large enough to ` normalize ' ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 , and still be within the uncertainty range .",
    "another source of significant systematic uncertainty is the stellar radial velocity dispersion .",
    "in fact , contrary to our @xmath12 , the radial profiles of @xmath9 derived by l08 are not based on observations , but on a simple model that relates @xmath9 to the surface density and scale length of the stellar disc ( see appendix b.3 of l08 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "stellar velocity dispersions have only been measured in three galaxies of the sample : ngc 628 ( ganda et al .",
    "2006 ; herrmann & ciardullo 2009 ) , ngc 3198 ( bottema 1988 , 1993 ) and ngc 4736 ( herrmann & ciardullo 2009 ) . to estimate the accuracy of l08 s model , we consider the radial profiles of @xmath106 derived by herrmann & ciardullo ( 2009 ) for ngc 628 and ngc 4736 , and convert @xmath106 into @xmath9 using the best - fitting model of gerssen & shapiro griffin ( 2012 ) , which relates @xmath107 to galaxy type ( see their fig .  4 ) .",
    "6 shows that l08 s model is accurate to within a factor of 2 except in the innermost / outermost regions of the stellar disc , where this model can overestimate / underestimate the observed @xmath108 by a larger factor .",
    "our @xmath12 is less uncertain .",
    "the main source of systematic uncertainty is beam smearing , which is greatest in the central regions of highly inclined galaxies ( e.g. , teuben 2002 ; cald - primo et al .",
    "however , beam smearing can increase the velocity dispersion by at most a factor of 1.2 at @xmath109 for galaxies with 30  inclination , 1.5 for 60  and 1.8 for 80 , with these factors decreasing quickly towards unity at larger radii ( cald - primo et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the bottom line is that systematic uncertainties in @xmath6 or in @xmath8 and @xmath9 can account for a significant increase in @xmath110 or decrease in @xmath111 , and thus move the inner discs of ngc 5194 and ngc 6946 into star - driven instability regimes .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "stars are the primary driver of gravitational instabilities even in the inner disc of ngc 1068 , a powerful nearby seyfert+starburst galaxy ( romeo & fathi 2016 ) .",
    "finally , the result that molecular gas plays a secondary role in disc instabilities ( at low redshift ) is based on the spatial resolution of current extragalactic surveys : bima song , heracles , sings and things . at scales smaller than a few 100 pc ,",
    "interstellar turbulence excites two non - classical instability regimes where molecular gas plays a primary role .",
    "such regimes stretch from galactic - scale toomre instability to clump - scale ( 3d ) jeans instability , and may be one of the missing links between disc instabilities and star formation .",
    "such regimes are illustrated in fig .  1 of romeo et al .",

    "the most novel feature of our analysis is that we have made use of observed radial profiles of the co and hi velocity dispersions , rather than observationally motivated values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the co velocity dispersion has a strong impact on the disc instability scenario , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . using the classical value @xmath30 motivated by kennicutt ( 1989 )",
    ", one would infer that molecular gas plays a significant role in disc instabilities even at distances as large as half the optical radius .",
    "in particular , the characteristic instability scale would have a bimodal radial distribution with an order - of - magnitude gap between regimes driven by the molecular gas ( @xmath112 ) and regimes driven by the stars ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "the characteristic instability scale has median value @xmath114 and @xmath115 scatter @xmath116 ( a factor of 1.5 ) ; 2% of the data are ` outliers ' , which systematic uncertainties can move into star - driven regimes . * in contrast to the characteristic instability scale , the @xmath4 stability parameter is robust against radial variations in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 . on average ,",
    "its radial profile remains remarkably flat and well above unity , but near or below the approximate threshold for stability against local , non - axisymmetric , linear perturbations and gas dissipation ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "specifically , the @xmath4 stability parameter has median value @xmath118 and @xmath115 scatter @xmath119 ( a factor of 1.3 ) ; 53% of the data fall within the range @xmath80 , and @xmath81 in 26% of the cases . *",
    "the conclusion that stars are the primary driver of disc instabilities in nearby star - forming spirals requires two further clarifications .",
    "first , in the linear phase of the disc instability process stars are strongly coupled to molecular gas , as shown in fig .  5 .",
    "this means that any instability driven by the stars will also perturb and destabilize molecular gas , and thus lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation .",
    "second , the fact that stars set the initial conditions for gravitational instability is true at the spatial resolution of current extragalactic surveys : bima song , heracles , sings and things . at scales smaller than @xmath120 ,",
    "interstellar turbulence opens new instability channels in which molecular gas plays a primary role ( e.g. , romeo et al .",

    "<S> the velocity dispersion of cold interstellar gas , @xmath0 , is one of the quantities that most radically affect the onset of gravitational instabilities in galaxy discs , and the quantity that is most drastically approximated in stability analyses . </S>",
    "<S> here we analyse the stability of a large sample of nearby star - forming spirals treating molecular gas , atomic gas and stars as three distinct components , and using radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath2 derived from heracles and things observations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the radial variations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 have a weak effect on the local stability level of galaxy discs , which remains remarkably flat and well above unity , but is low enough to ensure ( marginal ) instability against non - axisymmetric perturbations and gas dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the radial variation of @xmath1 has a strong impact on the size of the regions over which gravitational instabilities develop , and results in a characteristic instability scale that is one order of magnitude larger than the toomre length of molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> disc instabilities are driven , in fact , by the self - gravity of stars at kpc scales . </S>",
    "<S> this is true across the entire optical disc of every galaxy in the sample , with few exceptions . in the linear phase of the disc instability process </S>",
    "<S> , stars and molecular gas are strongly coupled , and it is such a coupling that ultimately triggers local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas .    </S>",
