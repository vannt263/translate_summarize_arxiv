    "galactic dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are intriguing objects with a deceptively simple appearance ",
    "roughly spheroidal shape , no gas , and no recent star formation . due to their closeness , these galaxies are studied in significantly more detail than other external galaxies ( see the review of @xcite ) . despite that ,",
    "the nature of dsphs and their place in the larger cosmological picture is not well understood .",
    "the first wave of enhanced interest in dsphs took off after the pioneer work of @xcite .",
    "based only on the three stars in draco with measured line - of - sight velocities , he boldly claimed that draco can be significantly dark matter ( dm ) dominated .",
    "the fact that the stellar velocity dispersion in dsphs is significantly larger than what would follow from the virial theorem for the luminous mass was later confirmed with much larger studies .",
    "for example , the latest compilation of @xcite contained 207 draco stars with measured line - of - sight velocities .",
    "similar results were obtained for other dsphs as well  both for the milky way and m31 satellites .",
    "there were attempts to explain the large stellar velocity dispersion in galactic dsphs without invoking the dm hypothesis .",
    "most notably , @xcite presented a model where dsphs are considered to be `` tidal dwarfs ''  virtually unbound stellar streams from dwarf galaxies tidally disrupted in the milky way potential .",
    "the model of @xcite appears to be not applicable to draco as it is unable to reproduce the narrow observed horizontal branch width of this dwarf @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will present additional evidence against draco being a tidal dwarf .",
    "the overall consensus now appears to be that dsphs do contain significant amounts of dm and are hence the smallest known objects with ( indirectly ) detected dm .",
    "this makes them very interesting objects , as they can be an important test bench for modern cosmological models and for the theories of dm .",
    "more recently , the interest in dsphs was rejuvenated after the realization that simple ( dm - only ) cosmological models overpredict the number of the milky way satellite galaxies by @xmath9 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this was coined the `` missing satellite problem '' of cosmology .",
    "the original analysis was done under the assumption that dm in dsphs has the same spatial extent as stars .",
    "relaxation of the above assumption led to a suggestion that only the most massive subhalos predicted to populate a galaxy - sized halo managed to form stars , with the rest of the subhalos staying dark @xcite .",
    "another way of solving the missing satellites problem is to assume that only the oldest subhalos formed stars , with the star formation in the younger subhalos being suppressed by the metagalactic ionizing radiation after the reionization of the universe was accomplished around @xmath10 @xcite . in reality , both mechanisms could have realized @xcite .    to discriminate between the two above solutions of the missing satellites problem and to place galactic dsphs in the right cosmological context one",
    "has to know the global parameters of these dwarfs , and most importantly , their total dm extent and mass .",
    "the traditional approach is to assume that the dwarf is in equilibrium ( thus ignoring the possible impact of the galactic tides ) , and to solve the jeans equation to infer the density profile of the dm halo based on the observed surface brightness and line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles . as the proper motions of individual stars in dsphs are not known , one has to resort to making certain assumptions about the anisotropy in the stellar velocities . due to a well known degeneracy between the assumed stellar anisotropy and inferred total enclosed mass",
    "there are many solutions to the jeans equation which are consistent with the observations .",
    "another limitation of the above approach is that dm can be traced only within the stellar body extent of the dwarf , so no conclusion can be made about the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is also not clear at what distance from the dwarf s center the virial equilibrium assumption breaks down due to galactic tides .",
    "some work has been done on the impact of tidal forces on the structure of galactic satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it was clearly demonstrated that the tidal stripping and shocking is a complex dynamic process .",
    "the deficiency of the above work is in using single - component models for the dwarf galaxies , which made it impossible to directly compare the results of the numerical simulations with the observations . in general ,",
    "stars in dsphs are distributed differently from dm , so they also behave differently in reaction to the external tides . to correctly describe the observable manifestations of the galactic tides in dsphs it is essential to use two - component ( stars @xmath0 dm ) dwarf models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we place joint constraints on the global properties of draco ( one of the best studied dsphs ) by ( 1 ) using cosmological predictions for the properties of dm halos , ( 2 ) developing very flexible stellar anisotropy model for dsphs , and ( 3 ) running a large set of high - resolution simulations of the evolution of two - component dwarfs in the galactic tidal field .",
    "we derive a sequence of cosmologically plausible models for draco which are consistent with all the observed structural and kinematical properties of this dwarf .",
    "our results are consistent with either of the two above solutions for the missing satellite problem .",
    "we consider two types of dm halos : theoretically motivated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) halos with a @xmath11 density cusp at the center , and observationally motivated @xcite halos , which have a flat core :    @xmath12}\\quad\\mbox{(burkert).}\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the scaling density and radius . at large distances from the center",
    "both halos have the same asymptotic density slope of @xmath15 .",
    "analysis of cosmological @xmath16-body simulations showed that the concentration @xmath17 of low - mass dm halos ( with the virial mass @xmath18  m@xmath3 ) has a log - normal distribution with the mean    @xmath19    and dispersion 0.14  dex ( * ? ? ? * with the correction of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath20 is the virial radius of the halo and @xmath21 is the redshift .",
    "@xcite showed that the four dwarf galaxies with a burkert dm halo profile studied by @xcite have the same dependence of the dm halo scaling density @xmath13 on the scaling radius @xmath14 as do the nfw halos in cosmological simulations .",
    "this result was obtained for @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that it holds true for other redshifts as well , and use the equation  ( [ eqc ] ) to find concentrations of both nfw and burkert halos .    using the formula of @xcite",
    ", one can estimate the comoving number density of dm halos per unit @xmath23 and per standard deviation in concentration :    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the number of standard deviations from the mean concentration , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the critical overdensity for spherical collapse extrapolated linearly to @xmath22 , @xmath28 is the present day mass density of the universe , and @xmath29 is the variance of the primordial density field on mass scale @xmath30 extrapolated linearly to @xmath22 . to estimate the above parameters we follow @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology and use the following values of the cosmological parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33  km  s@xmath34  mpc@xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that one can derive quite general and ( stellar ) model - independent constraints on the properties of the draco dm halo by combining the available observational data on this galaxy with the predictions of cosmology . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the distance to draco is @xmath36  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to consider different dm halo constraints in the plane of two scaling parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we summarize the global constraints in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the most obvious constraint is that the draco dm halo should have formed before the bulk of the draco stars formed .",
    "we assume that the first star burst in draco took place at least 10  gyr ago @xcite , or at @xmath37 . in figure  [ fig1 ] , the areas to the right of the dashed lines marked ``",
    "@xmath38 '' correspond to halos older than 10  gyr .",
    "the next constraint , @xmath39 , comes from the requirement for dm halos to be abundant enough to explain the observed number ( @xmath40 ) of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath41  mpc@xmath42 . as the function @xmath43 does not explicitly depend on @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( it depends on @xmath30 and @xmath21 ) , in @xcite we designed a numerical method for finding the most probable combination of ( @xmath30,@xmath21 ) corresponding to given values of ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) . as a by - product we also obtain the corresponding value of @xmath25 .",
    "the areas below the solid lines in figure  [ fig1 ] correspond to dm halos which were abundant enough to have been progenitors of dwarf spheroidals in the local group .    assuming that the tidal field of the milky way has not perturbed significantly the stars in the outskirts of draco out to a distance of @xmath44  kpc from its center ( the last observed point in the draco surface brightness profile of @xcite , see figure  [ fig2]a ) , the third constraint can be written as @xmath45 .",
    "( it is hard to imagine stars forming beyond the virial radius of its dm halo ) . the halos in the areas above the dash - dotted lines in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "satisfy the above criterion .",
    "in figure  [ fig4 ] we plot the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile for draco ( from @xcite ) .",
    "it has been noted that in draco and ursa minor the galactic outskirts appear to be kinematically cold @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no good explanation for this phenomena .",
    "given the fact that in the case of draco the only ( outermost ) radial bin which is `` cold '' contains only 6 stars with measured line - of - sight velocities , and is marginally ( at @xmath46 sigma level ) consistent with the global average for draco , @xmath47  km  s@xmath34 , we decided to exclude the last bin from our analysis .",
    "our assumption is that at the distance of @xmath48  kpc from the draco center ( half - way between the two last points in figure  [ fig4 ] ) the line - of - sight velocity dispersion for draco is roughly equal to the global average[multiblock footnote omitted ] : @xmath49  km  s@xmath34 ( the circle with a cross in figure  [ fig4 ] ) . at this distance",
    "the stellar density in draco is steeply declining ( see figure  [ fig2]a ) . as a result ,",
    "most of stars observed at the projected distance @xmath50 from the draco center are located roughly in the plane of the sky at the _ spatial _ distance @xmath50 from the center of the dwarf .",
    "we can then use @xmath51 as a lower limit of draco circular velocity at this distance , @xmath52 . indeed ,",
    "if one considers the extreme of purely radial orbits , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion at large distance from the galactic center will be close to zero . in the opposite extreme of purely circular orbits",
    ", one can show that @xmath53 becomes approximately equal to the circular velocity at this distance .",
    "we plot the solution of the equation @xmath54  km  s@xmath34 as long - dashed lines in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the areas above these lines correspond to halos which satisfy the above criterion .",
    "the result we derived here is approximate , but of model - independent nature .",
    "we present more accurate ( but also more model - dependent ) treatment in   [ st_model ] , where we fit stellar models to all the reliable observed @xmath53 points in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the last constraint is that the virial mass of the draco halo is somewhere between `` ridiculously '' low and high values @xmath55 and @xmath56  m@xmath3 ( the area between two dotted lines in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the lower limit is even lower , by a factor @xmath57 , than the classical `` mass follows light '' estimates @xcite .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to a satellite which would very quickly spiral in to the center of the milky way due to dynamical friction .",
    "as one can see , the last constraint does not add any new information to our exclusion plots in figure  [ fig1 ] .    from comparison of figures  [ fig1]a and",
    "[ fig1]b one can see that all the constraints except for the fourth one ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath34 ) are very similar for both nfw and burkert dm density profiles .",
    "this is intimately linked to our assumption that for a given virial mass @xmath30 and redshift @xmath21 both types of halos have the same concentration  given by equation  ( [ eqc ] ) .",
    "this automatically makes the scaling radii @xmath14 equal in both cases . at the same time",
    ", one can show that the scaling densities for nfw and burkert halos are related through    @xmath59/2-\\arctan c},\\ ] ]    which is close to unity for realistic halos ( the ratio changes from @xmath60 for @xmath61 ) . the fourth constraint , unlike the rest of the criteria , does not deal with a global property of a halo ( such as @xmath30 and @xmath21 or their derivatives  @xmath20 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "instead , it deals with the average dm density within a certain fixed radius  which can be dramatically different for cuspy nfw and flat - cored burkert models .",
    "the shaded areas in figure  [ fig1 ] correspond to dm halos which satisfy all of the above global constraints .",
    "as one can see , the draco halo parameters are not particularly well constrained , especially in the case of the nfw profile .",
    "still , one can make a few interesting observations .",
    "firstly , the most restrictive ( and useful ) constraints are @xmath62  mpc@xmath42 and @xmath63  km  s@xmath34 .",
    "secondly , there is plenty of room for draco to have formed before the end of the reionization of the universe at @xmath10 ( shaded areas to the right of the dashed lines marked `` @xmath64 '' in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thirdly , we can derive the range of possible values of different halo parameters .",
    "for nfw halos , our exclusion plot implies that @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67  kpc , and @xmath68 .",
    "( here units for @xmath30 and @xmath13 are m@xmath3 and m@xmath3  kpc@xmath42 , respectively . ) for burkert halos , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71  kpc , and @xmath72 .",
    "interestingly , for both nfw and burkert cases , draco could not have formed before @xmath73 , or more than 13.2  gyrs ago .",
    "the reason for that is that at larger redshifts dm halos with the virial radii @xmath74  kpc become too rare to correspond to a typical dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the local group .",
    "the main purpose of generating the exclusion plots in figure  [ fig1 ] was to significantly reduce the computational burden in the next step of our analysis , described in the next section , where we use the whole observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile along with the surface brightness profile to find the best - fitting stellar models and to further reduce the uncertainty in ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) values for the draco dm halo .",

    "we believe it is a reasonable approach , as in many realistic stellar systems the same dynamical processes shape simultaneously both density and anisotropy profiles .",

    "the essence of this approach is to use explicitly the distribution function ( df ) to set up the initial distribution of velocity vectors of dm particles ( isotropy was assumed ) .",
    "it was argued @xcite that using dfs explicitly is far superior to traditional local maxwellian approximation for cuspy models such as nfw . to reduce the boundary effects ,",

    "the only difference is that now we use a larger number of stellar particles , @xmath268 , to reduce the poisson noise in the observable properties of the models .",
    "our baseline number of dm particles is @xmath269 .",
    "test runs showed that in the most massive models ( n1,2 and b1,2 ) a much larger number of dm particles is required to prevent the artificial evolution of the stellar cluster at the center of the halo .",
    "we observed the central stellar density being significantly reduced ( by more than an order of magnitude in the worst cases ) in the low - resolution models .",
    "this effect does not depend on the number of stellar particles , and becomes less severe for larger @xmath164 and/or @xmath165 .",
    "as stars are only a trace population in our models , the most obvious explanation for the above artifact is that stars get scattered from the imperfections of the granulated gravitational potential of the dm halo . setting @xmath270 for the models n1 and b1 , and @xmath271 for the models n2 and b2 resulted in acceptable level of the artificial evolution of the surface brightness profile @xmath272 of the stellar cluster . in all our isolated models ,",
    "the change in the central surface brightness was negligible after 10  gyr of evolution ( with the only exception of the model b1 , where the change was @xmath273  dex ) . the radius corresponding to the outmost reliable draco isodensity contour of @xcite with @xmath274  m@xmath3  kpc@xmath275 ( @xmath276  kpc initially ) increased by mere @xmath277  dex .",
    "unfortunately , we observed significant evolution in the velocity anisotropy profiles @xmath278 in our isolated models , especially at the center of the halo .",
    "all our best - fitting stellar models have a strong radial anisotropy at the center ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . in our @xmath16-body simulations with live dm halos",
    "the stellar core becomes close to isotropic within the first gyr , suggesting that the particle - particle interactions are not the main culprit , as such effects would take gyrs to manifest themselves .",

    "central radial anisotropy reduces almost to zero after a few crossing times .",
    "we do not know the exact reason for the above effect .",
    "the possible explanations are ( 1 ) the ( unknown ) df corresponding to our choice of anisotropy , stellar density , and gravitational potential profiles is okay ( positive everywhere ) , but the pseudo - maxwellian approximation we use to set up the stellar velocities is not good for systems with strong radial anisotropy at the center , and/or ( 2 ) the df is not physical ( i.e. is negative ) at the center",
    ". we also want to point out that a real stellar system can not have a radial anisotropy all the way to its center , as the radial velocity dispersion diverges in such case when @xmath129 . to demonstrate this",
    ", we write down the solution of the jeans equation  ( [ jeans2 ] ) in the case of constant anisotropy @xcite    @xmath279    where the constant @xmath280 is positive for the case of radial anisotropy .",
    "the integral in equation  ( [ const ] ) is non - zero for @xmath281 , resulting in divergent @xmath78 at the center of the system .",
    "obviously , in a real object radial anisotropy should break down at some radius , changing into isotropy or tangential anisotropy .",
    "it is also hard to expect radially divergent velocity dispersion in a stellar system with a flat core , especially in the case of a flat - cored ( burkert ) dm halo .",
    "we want to emphasize that even though we can not guarantee that the stellar models in table  [ tab1 ] are physical ( especially at the center ) , in our simulations they quickly relax to a stable configuration , with the surface brightness profile virtually identical to the observed one , and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile @xmath150 still consistent with the observations . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we plot @xmath150 profiles for our stellar models in a static dm potential after 10  gyr of evolution integrated over the same six radial bins as the observational data of @xcite . as one can see , the profiles for evolved stellar clusters are a reasonably good match to the observations .",
    "( the @xmath100 measure becomes a factor of two larger in the evolved models . )",
    "we also used the isolated runs to estimate the accumulated total energy errors in our models . in the case of live dm halos , the total energy for dm @xmath0 stars is conserved to better than @xmath282% ( typically @xmath283% ) after 10  gyr of evolution . to estimate the total energy errors for stars only , we measured the difference in stellar total energy at @xmath284  gyr ( when the cluster has reached a steady state configuration ) and at @xmath285  gyr in our static dm halo simulations .",
    "the difference was again @xmath286% .",

    ", we used the parallel version of the multi - stepping tree code gadget @xcite . the number of stellar and dm particles and the corresponding gravitational softening lengths were the same as in the isolated models described in   [ isol ] .",
    "each draco model was simulated for six different orbits from table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "initially , draco was located at the apocenter of its orbit .",
    "altogether we made 48 tidal stripping simulations .",
    "we refer to the models by both the model number from table  [ tab1 ] and the orbit number from table  [ tab2 ] , e.g. model n1 - 5 .",
    "most of the results we give below are for the latest moment of time when the dwarf was located at the current distance of draco from the galactic center of @xmath287  kpc ( we do not make distinction between the dwarf moving inward or outward ) , which took place @xmath288  gyr from the beginning of the simulations ( @xmath289  gyr for the orbits @xmath290 ) .",
    "all our models experienced tidal stripping of different degree .",
    "as figure  [ fig9]a shows , the dm mass of the gravitationally bound remnant is between 90% ( model n5 - 1 ) and 0.1% ( model n1 - 6 ) of the original mass at the end of the simulations .",
    "three of our models became completely gravitationally unbound within 10  gyr : b1 - 6 ( after 3.2  gyr and 3 pericenter passages ) , b2 - 6 ( after 7.8  gyr and 6 pericenter passages ) , and b1 - 5 ( after 9.4  gyr and 7 pericenter passages ) . in the latter case , the dwarf is still bound when it is located at @xmath287  kpc at the end of the simulations ( when we compare the results of the simulations with the observed properties of draco )  but only barely so .",
    "it is not surprising that all the unbound models have burkert halos .",
    "indeed , for given mass and scaling radius these halos have lower averaged density than nfw halos in the central area .",
    "if truncated instantaneously at a certain radius , the total energy of the remnant becomes positive for burkert halos at a radius @xmath291 times larger than for nfw halos @xcite .",
    "another result which can be explained is that the most massive halos are easier to strip and disrupt tidally than the less massive ones .",
    "all our models ( both massive and of lower mass ) have a comparable dm density within the observed extent of draco ( because of the virial theorem ) , so in the point mass approximation they should be equally susceptible to tidal forces . however , the point mass approximation ( used to derive equation  [ [ eq_rtid ] ] ) breaks down for our most massive halos , as their size becomes comparable to the pericentric distance , so the strongly non - linear components of the tidal force become important .",
    "not surprisingly , our most massive halos on the orbit 6 were either totally disrupted ( model b1 - 6 ) or lost 99.9% of its original mass ( model n1 - 6 ) after 10  gyr of evolution .",
    "in all of our models a fraction of stars has been tidally stripped by the end of the simulations  even for the orbit 1 . in two cases ( models b1 - 6 and b2 - 6 )",
    ", stars have become completely unbound by the time the dwarf was passing at the distance of @xmath287  kpc from the galactic center for the last time . in other cases , the fraction of escaped stars was between @xmath292 for the models b1 - 2,3,4 and 96.6% for the model n1 - 6 ( see figure  [ fig9]b ) .    when analyzing the global properties of the stellar cluster at the end of the simulations , the most obvious result is the fact that the more disruptive the orbit is , the more the system is affected by the tidal shocks experienced near the pericenter of the orbit .",
    "( orbits with a larger number from table  [ tab2 ] are more disruptive for two reasons : they have smaller pericentric distance , and they have shorter orbital period , so the number of pericentric passages in 10  gyr is larger . )",
    "dwarfs are puffed up by the tidal shocks , with the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath293 becoming smaller ( figure  [ fig9]c ) , central surface brightness decreasing ( not shown , but is qualitatively similar to @xmath293 behavior ) , and the projected half - light radius becoming larger ( except for the extreme case of the orbit 6 when both tidal shocking and tidal stripping are important , see figure  [ fig9]d ) .",
    "our models are highly idealized when it comes to long - term evolution of stellar tidal streams . on our most disruptive orbits 5 and 6 ,",
    "a significant fraction of stars becomes unbound over the course of the tidal evolution , with the most of the tidally stripped stars following very closely the almost radial orbit of the dwarf . from the sun location , many of these stars project on a rather small area in the sky inside or around the apparent location of the dwarf .",
    "this can be quite unphysical , as such cold tidal streams are not expected to survive for many gigayears in the milky way halo due to its triaxiality and clumpiness ( as predicted by cosmology ) and due to interaction with baryonic structures in the galaxy ( stellar disk with spiral arms , stellar bar , giant molecular clouds ) . to circumvent this difficulty , in this section",
    "we discuss all the observable model properties for two extreme cases : ( a ) all stars are taken into account , and ( b ) only the stars ( both bound and unbound ) located within the spatial distance of 5  kpc from the center of the dwarf are considered . in the latter case , the spatial truncation of the tidal stream ensures that only the most recently stripped stars are used for calculating the observable properties of the models .    on a more detailed level ,",
    "the impact of both tidal shocks and tidal stripping and heating can be seen in figure  [ fig11 ] . here",
    "we show the surface brightness profiles ( panel a ) and line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles ( panel b ) for the models n1 - 1,4,5,6 .",
    "the most obvious effect in figure  [ fig11 ] is the global decrease of @xmath53 for orbits with smaller pericentric distance ( excluding the orbit 6 ) , accompanied by a small decrease in the central surface brightness and a slight radial expansion of the system .",
    "no obvious tidal truncation and tidal heating is observed in the outskirts in the cluster .",
    "these results were obtained for the stars located within the spatial distance of 5  kpc from the center of the dwarf , but in the case when all stars are included the profiles are practically the same .",
    "the orbit 6 is a completely different case : one can see the @xmath53 being dramatically inflated in the outskirts of the dwarf due to superposition of tidally removed stars on the dwarf ( figure  [ fig11]b ) .",
    "this effect becomes even more dramatic when we include all the stars , with the line - of - sight velocity dispersion reaching @xmath294  km  s@xmath34 in the outermost observed bin . as we discussed in the previous paragraph",
    ", it is quite unlikely that old tidal streams can stay so well collimated for many gigayears to produce the above effect .",
    "but even for the conservative case of considering only freshly stripped stars the steeply growing @xmath53 profile for the model n1 - 6 is grossly inconsistent with the observed profiles of draco and other dwarf spheroidals , where @xmath53 is either not changing or decreasing at large distances from the center .",
    "the change in the surface brightness profile for the model n1 - 6 is also quite dramatic ( figure  [ fig11]a , long - dashed line ) .",
    "the outer @xmath272 slope becomes very shallow which is inconsistent with the observed profiles for galactic dsphs .",
    "the slope becomes even more shallow when we include stars beyond the spatial distance of 5  kpc from the center of the dwarf .",
    "similar behavior ( in terms of shallow outer @xmath295 profiles and inflated @xmath53 in the outskirts of the dwarf ) is also observed in other models with the orbit 6 ( both bound and unbound ) .",
    "the possible exceptions are the models n4 - 6 and n5 - 6 , which are consistent with the observations of draco when we consider only freshly stripped stars .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that draco and other galactic dsphs have experienced tidal interactions as dramatic as our models on the orbit 6 .    to facilitate the comparison of our models with the observed stellar isodensity contours of draco of @xcite we designed the following projection algorithm .",
    "( a ) the frame of reference is rotated to place the center of the dwarf on the negative side of the axis @xmath296 , with the axis @xmath297 located in the orbital plane of the dwarf and pointing in the direction of the orbital motion .",
    "( b ) as the direction of the proper motion of draco is not known ( see discussion in   [ orbits ] ) and the current angle between the vector connecting draco with the center of the galaxy and the vector connecting draco with sun is @xmath298 , we consider three extreme cases of the possible vantage point location which should encompass the whole range of projected model appearances : view from the galactic center ( @xmath299 ) , view from a point in the orbital plane of draco located at 82  kpc from the dwarf with @xmath298 , and view from a point in the plane which is perpendicular to the orbital plane of draco at 82  kpc and with @xmath298 .",
    "we found that due to the fact that for draco the angle @xmath300 is small ( which is also the case for other galactic dsphs with the exception of sagittarius ) , the observable properties of our models ( @xmath295 and @xmath53 profiles and surface brightness maps ) do not depend noticeably on the vantage point we choose  especially for the case when we only include freshly stripped stars .",
    "( c ) we exclude stars with @xmath301  kpc to avoid contamination of our maps with local tidal stream overdensities which would be discarded by observers as local galactic stars .",
    "( d ) we perform prospective projection of the stellar particles smoothed with a gaussian beam which has a fixed physical size ( either 0.15 or 0.5  kpc ) and brightness inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the particle from the observer .",
    "this procedure makes the `` surface brightness '' of individual particles invariant of the distance from the observer , which is appropriate for spatially resolved clumps of the tidal stream .",
    "the most interesting result obtained from the analysis of the surface brightness maps is the lack of the classical s - shaped tidal tails in our models . in the case of significant tidal stripping ( figure  [ fig12 ] , two different vantage points are shown ) the stellar isodensity contours change from being spherical near the center of the dwarf to being increasingly more elliptical and often off - centered at larger distances . in the cases with less severe stripping , outer contour boxiness is observed in some of the models . for orbits 1 - 3",
    "the surface density of the tidally removed stars is so low that it is hard to draw any conclusion as to the shape of the tidally distorted isodensity contours ( except for the fact that the galaxy is observed against the background and/or foreground of a few degrees wide belt of tidally stripped stars ) .",
    "the explanation for the above effect is in the facts that the tidal stripping is significant only for very eccentric ( almost radial ) draco orbits with @xmath302  kpc , and that currently draco is located @xmath303  kpc away from the apocenter of its orbit ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . under these circumstances ,",
    "line of sight practically coincides with the direction of the tidal elongation of draco , with both tidal tails seen edge - on .",
    "this is an interesting result , as it suggests that the lack of s - shaped isodensity contours in the outskirts of the galactic dsphs can not be used to support a claim that the dwarf has not experienced significant tidal stripping in the gravitational potential of the milky way .",
    "it appears that the presence ( absence ) of tidally heated stars in the outskirts of dsphs is much more sensitive indicator of tidal stripping being significant ( not significant ) .",
    "we measured for all our models the critical surface brightness @xmath304 when the outer isodensity contours become noticeably distorted due to tidal effects .",
    "the two models which became gravitationally unbound by the end of the simulations ( b1 - 6 and b2 - 6 ) show very distorted contours all the way to the center of the dwarf ( see figure  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "they also have dramatically inflated line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion profiles ( up to @xmath305  km  s@xmath34 ) , and very shallow outer surface brightness slopes .",
    "all of the above makes these two models ( and most probably any other unbound model for a dsph ) completely inconsistent with the observed properties of the galactic dsphs . among the bound models , the one which has experienced the most dramatic tidal stripping ( model n1 - 6 ) is also the one which has the largest value for @xmath304 : @xmath306  m@xmath3  deg@xmath275 , which would correspond to @xmath307 sigma isodensity contour of @xcite . in all other cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath304 is significantly lower : @xmath308  m@xmath3  deg@xmath275 for the models on the orbit 6 , and less than @xmath309  m@xmath3  deg@xmath275 for other orbits . for the orbits 1 , 2 , and",
    "3 @xmath304 was too small to be measured .",
    "these values of @xmath304 are significantly lower ( by a factor of @xmath310 ) than the two - sigma detection limit of @xcite .",
    "the angular radius of the smallest distorted isodensity contour is @xmath311 for the orbit 6 ( with the exception of the models b1 , b2 , and n1 ) , and @xmath312 for other orbits .",
    "one very interesting special case is that of the model b1 .",
    "this model has a halo with a flat dm core of size @xmath313  kpc ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , so all the observed extent of draco is within this large harmonic core . in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    "we show the inner ( corresponding to the observed part of draco ) isodensity contours for the models b1 - 4 and b1 - 1 . unlike all other models ( both nfw and burkert ) , here",
    "one can see a relatively strong tidal distortion of the contours at distances @xmath314 from the center of the dwarf .",
    "the distortions are substantial even for orbit 1 ( figure  [ fig13]b ) which has the largest pericentric distance of 70  kpc .",
    "the distorted contours are both elliptical and non - concentric .",
    "interestingly , the effect is minimal for the two orbits which have the smallest eccentricity  orbits 2 and 3 with @xmath315 .",
    "the distortions are strong for the more eccentric orbits 1 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "it appears that it is the variability of the tidal force rather than its strength which is the primary governing factor for the above effect .",
    "as the observed stellar isodensity contours of draco are very regular and concentric @xcite , results of our simulations suggest that it is unlikely that draco resides in a large dm harmonic core  unless it happened to move on a close to circular orbit with @xmath316  kpc and @xmath317 .",
    "in this paper we presented a sequence of composite ( stars @xmath0 dm ) models for draco , listed in table  [ tab1 ] , which satisfy all the available observational and cosmological constraints .",
    "we showed that for the most of physically plausible orbits of draco in the galactic potential the tidal forces could not modify the observable properties of our models appreciably after 10  gyr of evolution .",
    "both `` standard '' cuspy nfw dm halos and burkert halos with a flat core provide a reasonably good description of draco .",
    "the properties of a burkert halo are better constrained by our analysis .",
    "most importantly , if draco has a flat core , it should have formed at or before the end of the reionization of the universe : @xmath318 .",
    "tidal stripping simulations put even stronger constraints on the flat - core case : we showed in the previous section that our most massive burkert model b1 would be consistent with the observations only for a very limited range of possible draco orbits : orbit 6 is ruled out as the model becomes completely unbound with dramatically inflated @xmath53 and very shallow @xmath295 profiles , whereas for the orbits 1 , 4 , and 5 ( and also 6 ) we observe significant distortion of inner stellar isodensity contours which is most definitely not consistent with the regular isodensity contour shape observed in draco by @xcite .",
    "only the lowest eccentricity orbits 2 and 3 are not ruled out by our analysis .",
    "an nfw halo is less constrained by the available observations of draco : the halo formation redshift @xmath21 is anywhere between @xmath258 and @xmath233 , whereas the initial virial mass could be between @xmath319 and @xmath320  m@xmath3 . in the smaller mass ( and larger",
    "@xmath21 ) limit the halos are so sturdy that even for our most disruptive orbit 6 the observable parameters of the model can still be consistent with the draco observations after 10  gyr of tidal evolution .",
    "if draco was accreted by the milky way more recently than 10  gyr ago , the impact of the tidal forces would be even smaller . for more massive nfw halos and for all burkert models the orbit 6 can be ruled out as the model predicts inflated line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the outskirts of the dwarf which would be at odds with observations .",
    "how strong is our case against draco ( and other dsphs ) being a `` tidal dwarf ''  remnants of a dwarf galaxy which are not gravitationally bound at the present time ? in the previous section we suggested that the fact that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is dramatically ( by up to an order of magnitude ) inflated in our two `` tidal dwarf '' candidates , models b1 - 6 and b2 - 6 , can be used to rule out the `` tidal dwarf '' explanation for draco .",
    "here we want to caution that a more detailed comparison between the model and observations is required to critically assess our conclusion .",
    "our large estimates of @xmath53 were derived for stars with any line - of - sight velocity projected onto the dwarf disk and optionally restricted to lie within the spatial distance of 5  kpc from the dwarf s center .",
    "many of the high - velocity tidal tail stars responsible for inflating @xmath53 would be discarded by observers as `` not belonging to the galaxy '' . in figure  [ fig14 ]",
    "we show the distribution of line - of - sight velocities @xmath250 for the models b1 - 6 and b2 - 6 .",
    "we show separately histograms for freshly stripped stars ( solid lines ) and for all stars projected on the disk of the dwarf ( dashed lines ) .",
    "as one can see , the situation depends strongly on how recently the dwarf became unbound , and on longevity of the cold tidal streams in the galactic halo .",
    "the model b1 - 6 became unbound many orbits ( almost 7  gyr ) ago , and has a very wide distribution of @xmath250  even for freshly stripped stars .",
    "the model b2 - 6 , on the other hand , became unbound only @xmath258  gyr ago , and has more complex distribution of @xmath321 . in this model ,",
    "the freshly removed stars are virtually all concentrated within a relatively narrow interval , with @xmath53 being inflated mainly due to the presence of one high velocity stellar particle with @xmath322  km  s@xmath34 .",
    "such stars will definitely be discarded by observers . when we consider all stars ( dashed line in figure  [ fig14]b ) , the distribution of @xmath250 is much wider than in galactic dsphs .",
    "in the case of the model b2 - 6 , the situation thus sensitively depends on how long the tidal stream can stay collimated in the milky way potential .    another important evidence against draco being an unbound stream of stars is presented in figure  [ fig15 ] . here",
    "we show surface brightness maps for our two unbound models b1 - 6 and b2 - 6 .",
    "one can see that the contours are irregular and not concentric  even near the center of the dwarf .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the regular appearance of the observed isodensity contours in draco @xcite .",
    "pending the arrival of accurate proper motion measurements for draco , let us be slightly more definitive in trying to determine the nature and cosmological significance of draco by assuming that it is moving on the orbit 3 , which is the most probable one ( see   [ orbits ] ) . from figure  [ fig9 ]",
    "one can then infer that if draco is a cosmological halo , its current dm mass is between @xmath323 and @xmath324  m@xmath3 , the fraction of the tidally stripped stars is @xmath325% , and the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath293 , central surface brightness @xmath326 , and the half - light radius @xmath266 has changed due to tidal shocks by no more than @xmath327 , @xmath328 , and @xmath329  dex , respectively , in the last 10  gyr .",
    "this orbit has @xmath330  kpc , placing it well outside of the galactic disk .",
    "stellar tidal tails produced by our models on this orbit are extremely weak , with the surface brightness sensitivity required to see the isodensity contours distorted due to tidal forces being better than @xmath331  m@xmath3  deg@xmath275 , or more that two orders of magnitude better that the observations of @xcite . the dm halo could be either nfw or burkert , and was formed after @xmath73 .",
    "our results then support either of the two recently proposed solutions to the `` missing satellites '' problem @xcite : that the galactic dsphs are the most massive subhalos predicted by cosmological simulations to orbit in the halo of a milky way sized galaxy @xcite , or that the galactic dsphs are the halos which managed to form stars before the reionization of the universe was completed around @xmath332 @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that unfortunately there is not enough of observational data yet to discriminate between the two above scenarios .",
    "much better quality line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles , deeper surface brightness maps , and ideally accurate proper motion measurements are required to produce further progress in this direction .",
    "we would like to mention a few most important deficiencies of our tidal stripping model .",
    "the first one is due to our use of a spherically symmetric potential for the milky way . as a result",
    ", we ignore disk shocking , which can be very important for the orbits with @xmath302  kpc .",
    "we tried to partly circumvent this deficiency by considering an orbit with extremely small pericentric distance : orbit 6 with @xmath333  kpc .",
    "ideally , we would prefer to include the disk in our simulations , but this would result in significant increase in number of required models , which would make our project not feasible with the current level of computing power .    the second problem is generic to existing tidal stripping simulations of galactic satellites ( dsphs and globular clusters ) , and is caused by our use of a static potential for the milky way halo . in a realistic ( live ) galactic halo very massive satellites should experience dynamical friction , which would gradually bring them closer to the center of the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , we could not use a simple analytical formula to estimate the impact of the dynamical friction on our results .",
    "the dynamical friction would be strongest for the orbits 6 and 5 , which have the smallest pericentric distances .",
    "our subhalos on these orbits experience dramatic mass loss ( up to 90% and 70% , respectively ) during the first pericentric passage , rendering the constant satellite mass formula of @xcite not applicable .",
    "the dynamical friction equation of @xcite does not have this limitation , but it was derived for the special case of a subhalo with a truncated isothermal dm density profile with a core which is very different from both the nfw and burkert profiles of our subhalos .",
    "we want to emphasize that an inclusion of dynamical friction in our model would make our conclusion , that the observable properties of the most of our dwarfs were not affected noticeable by tidal forces , even stronger , as the dwarfs would start off at larger distance from the milky way center where the tidal forces are weaker .",
    "in addition , the use of static potential ignores the impact of the gravitational field of the satellite on the milky way halo",
    ". this effect can be very important for massive dwarfs on almost radial orbits , with the potential of both the satellite and the milky way center violently fluctuating during the pericentric passage , leading to an exchange of energy between the dwarf and the galactic halo ( similar to the mechanism of violent relaxation ) .",
    "the above effect would probably be important only for the orbit 6 , which we were able to rule out for the most of our draco models .",
    "it is important to mention that our models do not cover all possible initial configurations of draco . in a more general case",
    ", one would have to start with arbitrary initial stellar and dm density profiles ( with the initial stellar velocity dispersion profile following from eq .",
    "[ [ jeans ] ] ) . after 10  gyr of evolution in the galactic tidal field",
    "both profiles could become substantially different , with the line - of - sight velocity dispersion either increasing ( due to the projection of unbound stars ) or decreasing ( due to tidal shocks ; see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the more general case would require a dramatic increase in supercomputing time , which would make our approach infeasible .",
    "we want to emphasize that despite the fact that our models probably do not include all possible initial draco configurations , they do constitute a family of fully self - consistent models which match well all the available observations of draco .",
    "a potentially important evolutionary factor not included in our model is an interaction between draco and dark subhalos , predicted to be present in the milky way halo in large numbers by @xmath6cdm cosmological models .",
    "this effect was studied on larger scales by @xcite , who showed that in a cluster environment the galaxy - galaxy harassment can be substantial .",
    "it is not clear if the harassment on a smaller , galactic scale would be of the same order : unlike the cluster scale , where the numbers of modeled and observed galaxies are in good agreement , there is a `` missing satellites '' issue on galactic scales .",
    "we presented two one - parameter families ( separately for nfw and burkert dm density profiles ) of composite ( stars @xmath0 dm ) models for draco which satisfy all the available observational and cosmological constraints .",
    "we showed that these models can survive tidal shocks and stripping on most realistic draco orbits in the galactic potential for 10  gyr , with no appreciable impact on their observable properties .",
    "both nfw and burkert dm halo profiles are found to be equally plausible for draco .",
    "the dm halos are either massive ( up to @xmath334  m@xmath3 ) and recently formed ( @xmath1 ) , or less massive ( down to @xmath5  m@xmath3 ) and older ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "consequently , our results can be used to support either of the two popular solutions of the missing satellites problem  `` very massive dwarfs '' and `` very old dwarfs '' .",
    "higher quality observations ( line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles , surface brightness maps , proper motion measurements ) are required to further constraint the properties of galactic dsphs and to place them in the right cosmological context .",
    "we would like to thank jan kleyna for providing the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile for draco .",

    "<S> by fitting a flexible stellar anisotropy model to the observed surface brightness and line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles of draco we derive a sequence of cosmologically plausible two - component ( stars @xmath0 dark matter ) models for this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the models are consistent with all the available observations and can have either cuspy navarro - frenk - white or flat - cored dark matter density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter halos either formed relatively recently ( at @xmath1 ) and are massive ( up to @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) , or formed before the end of the reionization of the universe ( @xmath4 ) and are less massive ( down to @xmath5  m@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus support either of the two popular solutions of the `` missing satellites '' problem of @xmath6 cold dark matter cosmology  that dwarf spheroidals are either very massive , or very old . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out high - resolution simulations of the tidal evolution of our two - component draco models in the potential of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our simulations suggest that the observable properties of draco have not been appreciably affected by the galactic tides after 10  gyr of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we rule out draco being a `` tidal dwarf ''  a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy . almost radial draco orbits ( with the pericentric distance @xmath7  kpc ) are also ruled out by our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a harmonic dark matter core can be consistent with observations only for a very limited choice of draco orbits ( with the apocentric - to - pericentric distances ratio of @xmath8 ) . </S>"
