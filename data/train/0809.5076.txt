    "to significantly improve on previous reactor antineutrino experiments , next - generation experiments will make use of a two - detector setup . a far detector is to be placed an optimal distance away from the reactor core so as to maximize @xmath3-driven electron antineutrino disappearance , while a near detector is placed close to the reactor core in order to measure the `` unoscillated '' electron antineutrino flux . assuming differences between near and far detectors are understood at the few permille level and that enough statistics are accumulated , one ultimately aims at being sensitive to @xmath5 values around @xmath10 .",

''    the results of the above simplified analysis need to be qualified . in the case of `` large '' @xmath46 , @xmath88 , and the ambiguity is erased ( this is the scenario discussed in @xcite ) .",

    "the above results are more or less pronounced depending on one s ability to `` see '' distortions of the recoil positron energy spectrum .",
    "a simple counting experiment is very susceptible to hidden @xmath82-driven effects while a binned data analysis ( at both the near and far detectors ) seems able to disentangle @xmath3 from @xmath82-driven effects .    if there is indeed a light sterile neutrino associated to @xmath168\\times 10^{-2}$ ]  ev@xmath1 , @xmath3-driven reactor antineutrino experiments should be able to see large spectral distortions in the near detector , in which case one can determine not only @xmath82 but also @xmath46 .",
    "it is curious to note that , for @xmath46 values close to 0.1  ev@xmath1 , the roles of the near and far detectors as far as studying @xmath82-driven effects are reversed compared to those associated to studying @xmath3-driven effects . for these mass - squared differences , oscillation effects average out in the far detector ( even in a finely - binned analysis ) .",
    "this allows one to determine the `` averaged - out '' neutrino flux and hence helps extract the value of @xmath82 from the depths of the oscillation minima . in the absence of @xmath82-driven effects",
    ", we estimate that values of @xmath64 as small as 1 percent can be ruled out with a binned analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig:14_limit](left ) ) .",
    "sterile neutrino effects at @xmath3-driven reactor experiments have been considered in the past , but in a different mass - squared difference regime .",
    "the authors of @xcite recently discussed the effect of sterile neutrinos related to a potential @xmath169 solution to the lsnd anomaly .",
    "there , the new mixing angles and mass - squared differences lead to averaged out effects at both the near and far detectors . here , on the other hand , we concentrate on a lower mass - squared difference regime where this is not the case .    if there are indeed such light sterile neutrinos , it is likely that the most sensitive terrestrial probes of their existence are the setups discussed here .",
    "this is not a coincidence : we are concentrating on values of @xmath46 where oscillation effects in the near detector are optimal .",
    "other near - future probes include long - baseline accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments . however , @xmath46-driven effects at next - generation @xmath3-driven appearance long - baseline experiments are proportional to the product of the squares of two potentially small mixing angles ( @xmath170 , using the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , next - generation studies of muon neutrino disappearance at similar setups are also unlikely to achieve sensitivity competitive with the one discussed here .",
    "note that @xmath46 is large enough that it leads to averaged - out effects at the far detector but too small to mediate observable effects in the near detectors of next - generation long - baseline experiments .. ] detailed recent analyses of next - generation oscillation probes of light sterile neutrinos , concentrating on @xmath46 values above 0.1  ev@xmath1 , can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that this range of sterile neutrino parameters is not motivated by any existing data , nor does it help address any existing outstanding issue in fundamental physics . on the other hand ,",
    "as already emphasized , little is known about sterile neutrinos .",
    "evidence for sterile neutrinos at any mass range would qualitatively change our understanding of particle physics ( and probably shed light on the mechanism behind light neutrino masses ) .",
    "finally , light sterile neutrinos qualify as an example of non - standard physics that may appear in next - generation reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "they can not only lead to nontrivial oscillation patterns in the data , but also modify the interpretation of reactor antineutrino data when it comes to measuring or constraining @xmath3 .",
    "our results also highlight the fact that new and interesting results may come out of the data in the near detector @xcite , which may provide more information than the measurement of the `` @xmath171 '' reactor antineutrino flux .",
    "we conclude by re - emphasizing that our simulations and analyses are not aimed at realistically describing experimental setups or quantitatively gauging their reach .",
    "qualitatively , however , our results capture the nontrivial impact of light sterile neutrinos at @xmath3-driven reactor antineutrino experiments .",
    "we hope that our findings will prompt the collaborations to pursue quantitative estimates of the impact of the very light sterile neutrinos introduced here .",
