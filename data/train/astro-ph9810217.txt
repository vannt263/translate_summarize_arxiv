    "the absorption system at @xmath0 towards q1718 + 4807 is well suited for a determination of d / h from analysis of the line profiles of the lyman series .",
    "we selected this line of sight to measure d / h for four reasons : ( 1 ) low redshift lyman lines are likely to be less contaminated by unrelated  lines .",
    "( 2 ) the background qso is bright and affords the possibility of high resolution uv spectroscopy with hst .",
    "( 3 ) iue spectra of the qso ( @xcite ) show a partial lyman limit which is very steep , which implies that the lyman series lines are unusually narrow . at high redshift",
    "most lyman lines are broad enough that they swallow the d lines .",
    "( 4 ) metal lines in keck optical spectra were very weak .",
    "we now estimate that hst+fos spectra limit the system s metallicity to less than 1/100 solar .",
    "webb ( 1997a , 1997b , hereafter wclflv ) have studied this system in detail and find d / h = 20 @xmath5 .",
    "they assume the absorber is simple , with a single velocity component ( e.g. one cloud in a halo ) and they assume that it produces lines with voigt profiles .",
    "these assumptions are justified by the simple appearance of the  and  lines and the steep lyman limit , but they are ruled out by the asymmetric line , unless d / h is very high .",
    "levshakov ( 1998 ) use the same data as wclflv and apply more sophisticated models which allow for correlations in the velocity field ( non - voigt profiles ) .",
    "they use realistic parameters for the gas : temperatures from @xmath6 k , and turbulent velocities of 18  40 .",
    "their models produce asymmetric profiles for the  absorption , with more  absorption and less d on the blue side of the line , and they find a lower estimate of d / h @xmath7 .",
    "these models allow only one velocity component , and they assume that both the temperature and rms turbulent velocity are constant along the line of sight through this absorber .",
    "in this letter , we present new keck spectra , and analyze the range of d / h allowed by the hst+ghrs , hst+fos , and iue spectra for this absorber . in section 2 , we describe the spectroscopic observations and results from the four different instruments . in section 3 , we investigate a set of four models to analyze the systematic differences in the derived d / h between models .",
    "we also assess the magnitudes of other possible systematic effects .",
    "on march 3 , 1995 , the observations of qso 1718 + 4807 ( zem = 1.084 , v = 15.3 ) were obtained with the ghrs on hst .",
    "fifty - six five minute exposures of qso 1718 + 4807 , each covering 20502099   were taken with the g270 m grating .",
    "we used the small science aperture ( ssa ) to reduce the blurring effects of the hst spherical aberration in these post - costar observations .",
    "costar refers to the corrective optical system installed in the hst during the 1993 december space shuttle repair mission .",
    "we observed the qso in the fp - split= 4 sequence to reduce the effects of detector / photocathode fixed pattern noise .",
    "detector scanning step pattern number 4 provided two samples per diode width and sampling of the object spectrum and the detector background with the full 500 channel array of the ghrs digicon detector .",
    "we spent 11% of the observing time on the background observations . for technical descriptions of the ghrs ,",
    "see the space telescope science institute instrument handbooks ( solderblom 1994 ) .",
    "we processed the data with the hst calhrs reduction system developed by the ghrs science team .",
    "the data reduction converts raw counts into count rates , adjusting for pulse counting dead time losses , particle radiation , dark count events and diode to diode sensitivity variations .",
    "because of the low signal level in the individual spectra , we used a standard merge to combine the fifty - six integrations into a single spectrum . the line spread function ( lsf ) for these ssa observations should be well represented by a gaussian with fwhm = 14  ( gilliland 1992 ; robinson 1998 ) , which is consistent with the profile width we measured for wavelength calibration arc lamp observations obtained before and after the object integrations .    in this analysis , we use the wavelength scale given by wavecal exposures which we obtained during the ghrs observations of qso 1718 + 4807 , and we use the reduction package written by the ghrs team . we find a wavelength offset of 16.4  from the spectrum analyzed by wclflv , the difference most likely arising in an offset between the default ghrs wavelength scale and the wavelength calibrations taken between science exposures .",
    "the wavecal calibrations gives a more accurate scale for the ghrs spectrum and we use this scale throughout the paper .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure 1 , along with a cubic spline which we use to fit the quasar continuum .    at the redshift of interest , @xmath8 ,",
    "two absorption lines are seen in the ghrs spectrum : and .",
    "the diodes are 0.098   wide ( or 14.2 ) and two samples were taken per diode width .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is approximately 9 per diode sample .",
    "the ( @xmath9 ) line is best fit with a single voigt profile at @xmath10 with a column density , log n ( ) = @xmath11 @xmath4 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath12  ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the column density and velocity dispersion for measured in our ghrs spectrum agree with wclflv , but the measured redshift is offset by 16.4  due to the different wavelength calibrations .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of qso 1718 + 4807 with the hires spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the 10-m keck-1 telescope , with spectral resolution of 8  ( fwhm ) and full wavelength coverage from 3800   to 5000  .",
    "we performed a standard spectral extraction , described by tytler , fan & burles ( 1996 ) .",
    "three exposures totalling 4500 seconds gave snr = 50 per 2  pixel at the wavelengths of . as is common with most qso metal - line systems , we detected  ( @xmath142796 , 2803 ) , but not  ( @xmath152344 , 2382 , 2600 ) .",
    "we measure log n ( ) = @xmath16 @xmath4 , @xmath17 ( ) = @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( ) = @xmath20 , and place an upper limit for the   column density of log n ( ) @xmath21 @xmath4 .",
    "figure 2 shows the useful absorption lines at redshift @xmath22 .",
    "the three metal lines ,  ( @xmath231206 ) and  ( @xmath142796,2803 ) are optically thin and best fit with single voigt profiles .",
    "the velocity difference between the  and  lines is @xmath24 , where this @xmath25 error ignores errors in the wavelength scales .",
    "this difference is most likely due to the external error on the ghrs wavelength scale from the wavecal exposures , which has an rms of @xmath26  and a maximum of @xmath27 , and hence the  and  may arise in the same gas .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density is well constrained by the lyman limit which has optical depth near unity ( @xcite ) , and is responsible for the continuous absorption below 1550   in the iue spectrum ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we estimate the column density and 1@xmath28 errors log n ( ) = @xmath29 @xmath4 .",
    "the error in n ( ) is much smaller than the final error in d / h .",
    "another hydrogen system at @xmath30 also contributes to the optical depth below 1460  , with log n ( ) @xmath31 2 .",
    "wclflv fit the quasar continuum below 1550   with just the system at @xmath32 , and found log n ( ) = @xmath33 2 .",
    "we suggest this column density is too high , because the lower redshift lyman limit system accounts for some of the absorption below 1460  .",
    "we can estimate the temperature , metallicity , and neutral fraction in this absorption system .",
    "we use velocity information available for  and  to convert equivalent widths of other ions into approximate column densities .",
    "the velocity dispersions are well constrained for  and  by fitting single voigt profiles .",
    "for these two low - ionization species the observed columns may , but need not , come from the same gas .",
    "if we assume the temperature and turbulent velocity is identical for both species , we find @xmath34 k and @xmath35 .",
    "in archived spectra obtained with the hst faint object spectrograph ( r @xmath36 1300  too small to give column densities ) , we measure equivalent widths @xmath37 ( ) = @xmath38 for the  ( @xmath39 ) doublet at @xmath0 . using the above values for @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", this implies a column density log n ( ) = @xmath42 @xmath4 .",
    "we place an upper limit on the column density of   using a @xmath43 upper limit on the equivalent width of  ( @xmath44 ) , log n ( ) @xmath45 12.3 @xmath4 .",
    "we estimated the metal abundance using the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "we used an ionizing background spectrum at @xmath46 from haardt & madau ( 1997 ) , and we assumed that the ratio of the two alpha elements mg and si is solar .",
    "we find unremarkable parameters : an ionization parameter log u @xmath47 , a total hydrogen density @xmath48  @xmath4 , and a neutral fraction of @xmath49()@xmath50 , and a low metal abundance [ si / h ] @xmath51 .",
    "we measure d / h by comparing composite voigt profile models with the qso spectra . we consider four models which differ in the number of voigt profiles used , and other constraints . in each model , we adjust the parameters to minimize the @xmath52 .",
    "the value of d / h depends varies a lot depending on the redshift(s ) assumed for the h. this should be measured from the high order lyman series lines , which will be much less saturated than , and hence will hence show more details of the velocity distribution .",
    "since this data has not been obtained , we use the redshifts of the metal lines as constraints in models 1 and 2 . in table 1",
    ", we list the assumed redshift in each model .",
    "all models except 4 have a single velocity component , which produces a blend of  and  lines . in model 3",
    "we leave the redshift of the h free . in model 4 , we allow h at a second redshift which absorbs flux near @xmath17 ( ) .",
    "we do not use metal lines to constrain the velocity dispersion and temperature of the h and d because this would be an unnecessary constraint , which could be inaccurate , e.g. if variations in the ionization and metallicity give different parameters for the h and metals .    for each model",
    "we step through values of d / h , @xmath53 and fit to the ghrs data between 2066   @xmath54 2070  , with a constraint on n ( ) measured with the lyman limit .",
    "we perform a least squares minimization of all free parameters in the models over a range of d / h ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "this gives a measure of @xmath52 as a function of the single parameter d / h .",
    "we calculate the most likely d / h and confidence levels from the @xmath52 functions ( figure 4 ) . in table 1",
    ", we list the minimum @xmath55 , the corresponding value of d / h with 95% confidence levels , and the @xmath52 probability that the data came from the model .    in table 2",
    "we show that other uncertainties in the measurement are much smaller than the differences in the models and the random errors , with the exception of the one - sided uncertainty due to contaminating absorption .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty as @xmath56 where p is the probability of contamination by an absorber with column density n(c ) . with the above estimates from  systems",
    ", this uncertainty can be as high as @xmath57 .",
    "the unabsorbed intrinsic quasar continuum level is well determined : an error of 5% would give @xmath58 in all models .",
    "the  and  lines have fwhms greater than 41  and 36  respectively and the d / h is not sensitive to changes in the line spread function , which calibration spectra show is a gaussian with fwhm = 14 .",
    "there are two possible origins for the second hydrogen component : the random forest and gas associated with the d / h system .",
    "we discuss the likelihood of each .",
    "the low column density forest has not yet been measured at these redshifts , but we can estimate the line density directly from the ghrs spectrum in figure 1 . assuming that the four unidentified lines are  lines",
    ", we estimate a line density @xmath59 for lines with column densities 12.5 2  @xmath45 log n ( ) @xmath45 14.5 2  for @xmath46 .",
    "we calculate the probability of one or more lines to fall within 20  of the expected  position , p @xmath60 1% .",
    "this probability is calculated after the inspection of the data ( _ a posteriori _ ) .",
    "chance events often give much lower values for such probabilities .",
    "we know less about the velocity structure of low column , low redshift lyman limit systems .",
    "we would like to know , given that an lls has been seen , what is the probability that it has only one velocity component in ?",
    "there is no relevant data on , but keck telescope hires spectra provide clues .",
    "charlton & churchill ( 1998 ) found that all  systems in a sample of 26 at low redshift ( @xmath61 ) show 2 or more components in .",
    "this sample was restricted to  lines with w@xmath62   and would not have contained our  line , which is unusually weak with w@xmath63   .    a second sample of  lines with @xmath64 w@xmath65   was presented by churchill ( 1998 ) .",
    "the redshift range is appropriate : 0.4  1.2 , peaking near 0.7 .",
    "about 40% of these 30 systems have more than one component or show wide lines indicative of velocity structure .",
    "there are three reasons why the relevant fraction is @xmath66 % .",
    "many of their spectra are of low snr and would not show weak  components . 2 .  is often seen in gas where  is not detected in even the highest current snr spectra .",
    "3 . from the number of lines per unit redshift",
    ", they calculate that 74% of their systems do not have enough  to show lyman breaks , and hence they have less  than the absorber in 1718 + 4807 . clustering increases with  column ( cristiani 1997 ) , and hence we expect that the sub - sample with larger n ( ) , comparable to the 1718 absorber , will show more components . on the other hand ,",
    "1718 has extremely weak  lines and it was selected because the lls seemed unusually steep in iue spectra , which should exclude the more complex systems , and decrease the probability that 1718 would show more than one component . in summary , the probability that an absorber with  column like that in 1718 + 4807 shows more than one component is in the range 40  100% .",
    "the probability that the absorber in 1718 has more than one component will be lower than this , because we know its lls is steep , the  lines are weak , and they and the  line are simple , but we do not use this information because it would give an _ a posteriori _ probability , which would be hard to interpret .",
    "this is the first qso absorption system to give limits on d / h at a moderate redshift .",
    "compared to other systems at @xmath67 , this d / h limit is less reliable because the low signal to noise in the line and the lack of spectra of other lyman series lines allow a variety of models which give a wide range of possible d / h .",
    "the reduced contamination by the random forest is an advantage which does not compensate for the other two disadvantages .",
    "four lines are detected in high resolution spectra .  and",
    "show simple lines which can come from a simple model with one velocity component which gives voigt line profiles . in this case",
    "the asymmetry of the line must be explained by another ion .",
    "the wavelength of the asymmetric absorption is a good match to the expected location of d. our three models of this situation use different assumptions about the redshift of the gas and give 95% confidence levels in the range @xmath2 .    the asymmetric line can equally well be modeled with a more sophisticated velocity distribution .",
    "levshakov ( 1998 ) found models which give d / h @xmath7 if there are significant correlations in the velocity field .",
    "we present a model with gas at two velocities which gives the upper limit @xmath3 .",
    "absorbers with similar  columns show complex velocity structure in 40  100% of cases .",
    "the probability that this absorber is complex will be lower because we know that the  and  lines appear simple , and the lyman limit is steep .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the d / h comes from our ignorance of the  velocity field .",
    "if it is simple then the uncertainty in the redshift of this component , and random errors from the low signal to noise each give about a factor of two uncertainty ( 95% ) in d / h .",
    "we find a good fit to the metal lines using a solar mg / si abundance ratio , and [ si / h ] = @xmath68 .",
    "even though the system is at a much lower redshift than previous d / h observations , the low metallicity suggests minimal chemical processing .",
    "a high value of d / h ( @xmath69 ) gives a low cosmic baryon density , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "in standard big bang nucleosynthesis , a value for d / h fixes the cosmological baryon to photon ratio and predicts the primordial abundances of other elements . the high d / h is consistent with some estimates of the primordial @xmath72he abundance ( pagel 1992 , olive & steigman 1995 , olive 1997 ) , but not others ( izotov and thuan 1998 ) .",
    "the high d / h is not consistent with galactic chemical evolution ( tosi 1998 ) or with other independent measures of @xmath73 , from the lyman-@xmath1 forest ( bi & davidsen 1997 , rauch 1997 , weinberg 1997 , zhang 1998 ) , galaxy clusters ( schramm 1998 ) , and early data on the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ) .",
    "two other qsos give low values of d / h = @xmath74 ( burles & tytler 1998a , b ) which is consistent with all other qso data , but not with the high d / h .",
    "low d / h implies a high baryon density consistent with other measures .",
    "clearly , new measures of d / h in other qsos are urgently needed .",
