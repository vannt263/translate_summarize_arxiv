    "@xcite that the growth rate scales as the lundquist number to a positive exponent is significant : sweet - parker - like reconnection layers become more unstable with increasing lundquist number .",

    "this could be caused by either the outflow being slower such that there is more time for instabilities to develop , or that there will be less shear flow stabilization for cases with slower outflow .",
    "we test this hypothesis by repeating the largest stable and smallest unstable simulations for different asymmetries with @xmath193 and @xmath194 instead of @xmath195 ( where @xmath196 is the magnetic prandtl number ) .",
    "in contrast to the prediction of this hypothesis , higher viscosity leads to larger domain sizes becoming stable .",
    "this hypothesis is not supported ; however , an important caveat is that changing the viscosity affects the structure of the diffusion region as well as slowing down the outflow .",
    "the results do not rule out an alternative hypothesis that the development of the instability is correlated with intermittency in the flow .",
    "the results from this parameter study do not explain why simulations with moderate asymmetry are unstable for smaller domain sizes than symmetric cases , or why strongly asymmetric simulations are more stable .",
    "some insight may be gained by performing a linear stability analysis for the plasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow reconnection , including an asymptotic matching analysis and linear simulations,@xcite to see how the growth rate and eigenmode structure are modified by magnetic asymmetry .",
    "in this section , we make observational predictions for the behavior of plasmoids in solar , laboratory , and space plasmas during asymmetric inflow reconnection . differences between simulation and observation will provide key insights into the roles of important effects not included in the simulations , such as collisionless effects and three - dimensional effects .",
    "the standard model of solar eruptions predicts the formation of an elongated current sheet in the wake behind the rising flux rope . @xcite while unambiguous identification of these structures is difficult without magnetic field information , several features classified as current sheets have been observed in the solar corona .",
    "@xcite these current sheets necessarily have asymmetric outflow and may have asymmetric inflow . @xcite",
    "large blobs are frequently observed during these events @xcite which have been interpreted to be the result of a tearing or plasmoid instability.@xcite ` monster plasmoids ' such as those predicted by ref .",
    "are the most likely features to be observed .    in principle , an offset of blobs toward the weak field upstream region could be seen with instruments such as the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on the solar dynamics observatory , the x - ray telescope on hinode , and the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) on the solar and heliospheric observatory .",
    "however , if the current sheet is observed at a small angle with respect to the line of sight , then blobs that are physically offset might not show an apparent offset due to projection effects .",
    "constraints on the overall geometry are therefore vital .",
    "high - resolution , high - cadence observations by aia have been used to investigate vorticity in current sheet features at low heights , @xcite and it may be possible to find evidence for vorticity in current sheet blobs . however , the time cadence of lasco observations is too slow to observe vorticity on the scales of individual blobs .",
    "asymmetric reconnection also occurs during solar jets , @xcite which happen when newly emerged flux reconnects with pre - existing , overlying flux .",
    "@xcite the pre - existing flux is usually weaker , so our simulations predict plasmoid development preferentially into that region as well as the associated vortical motions .",
    "however , the spatial and temporal resolution requirements to observe small - scale structure and vortical motions during jet reconnection are likely beyond the capabilities of current instrumentation",
    ".      the current generation of dedicated laboratory experiments on magnetic reconnection are stable or marginally stable against the formation of multiple plasmoids or flux ropes .",
    "@xcite there is hope that the next generation of reconnection experiments will have @xmath154 to allow the plasmoid instability to be investigated in the laboratory .",
    "if the geometry is toroidal or cylindrical , then the reconnection process will necessarily have asymmetric inflow unless the radius is very large . in the magnetic reconnection experiment ( mrx ) , reconnection is driven by ramping up or down currents carried within toroidal flux cores . during the ` pull ' mode of operation",
    "( see fig .  5 of ref .  ) , the low radius side of the current sheet has stronger magnetic field than the high radius upstream region , and the current sheet gradually drifts toward lower radii.@xcite    it is therefore likely that the effects discussed in this paper will play some role in the dynamics of the plasmoid instability in future experiments .",
    "the asymmetry is not expected to be large , so the effects are not likely to be as pronounced as in the simulations . for future experiments with configurations similar to mrx but with @xmath154 ,",
    "our simulations predict the development of flux ropes preferentially into the high radius upstream region and and the development of net vorticity .",
    "the current sheet is expected to drift toward lower radii where the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "secondary reconnection is expected to be less efficient than predicted by two - dimensional , symmetric simulations because of the freedom of flux ropes to roll around each other , especially in the downstream region .",
    "however , these predictions are likely to be modified due to cylindrical geometry effects not included in our paper . simulations of the plasmoid instability in an experimental geometry will allow direct comparisons to be made ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "plasmoids and flux ropes are frequently observed _ in situ _ during reconnection events in planetary magnetospheres and the solar wind .",
    "reconnection events at the dayside magnetopause and its flanks have asymmetric inflow .",
    "@xcite in contrast to our two - dimensional resistive mhd simulations with an antiparallel magnetic field configuration , reconnection in near - earth space plasmas is in the collisionless regime .",
    "@xcite there is often a guide field , and shear flow effects are often important for dayside reconnection .",
    "@xcite there is also density asymmetry along with magnetic asymmetry .    for these reasons ,",
    "we anticipate that there will be significant qualitative differences between our simulations and _ in situ _ observations of asymmetric reconnection at the dayside magnetopause .",
    "nevertheless , some of the macroscopic features of our simulations may remain applicable during collisionless asymmetric inflow reconnection .",
    "island development into the weak field upstream region is in principal observable ; pragmatically , this will be difficult to diagnose because of the limited number of spacecraft taking measurements .",
    "more promising are measurements of vorticity in secondary flux ropes formed by reconnection ( see ref .   and references therein ) , but care will be needed to distinguish these features from kelvin - helmholtz vortices . to allow more direct comparisons to _ in situ _",
    "observations , it will be important to extend recently performed two - fluid , @xcite hybrid , @xcite and fully kinetic@xcite simulations of asymmetric inflow reconnection to investigate the dynamics of secondary islands and flux ropes .",
    "in this paper , we perform resistive mhd simulations of the plasmoid instability during magnetic reconnection with asymmetric upstream magnetic fields .",
    "this is in contrast to most studies of the plasmoid instability which assume that the reconnection process is symmetric . relaxing the assumption of symmetric inflow leads to qualitatively different results .    during symmetric simulations , the x - points and o - points within the current sheet region",
    "are located along the symmetry axis so that momentum from the outflow jets is efficiently transported into the islands .",
    "secondary islands within the current sheet do not develop net vorticity and are advected quickly out of the current sheet .",
    "secondary reconnection events associated with island merging have symmetric outflow but asymmetric inflow . in the downstream region ,",
    "some x - points and o - points are located away from the symmetry axis .",
    "because of the assumption of symmetry , the flow pattern in the downstream region is structured and therefore not best described as being turbulent .    during asymmetric simulations ,",
    "the locations of the x - points and o - points are offset from each other along the inflow direction .",
    "there is generally slow drifting of the current sheet into the strong field upstream region .",
    "x - points near the center of the sheet are displaced further into the strong field upstream region than x - points near the current sheet exits .",
    "not much happens in the strong field upstream region because of field line rigidity .",
    "islands develop preferentially into the weak field upstream region .",
    "consequently , outflow jets impact the islands obliquely rather than directly so that net vorticity develops and momentum transport into the islands is less efficient . during secondary reconnection ,",
    "shear flow associated with vorticity in the merging islands slows down reconnection .",
    "the downstream regions develop a complicated flow structure indicative of turbulence , with islands able to roll around each other as well as merge .",
    "we compare the reconnection rate enhancement between symmetric and asymmetric cases . during high lundquist number symmetric simulations ,",
    "the reconnection rate is enhanced above the value predicted from the sweet - parker model .",
    "this is consistent with previous work.@xcite during simulations with a magnetic asymmetry of @xmath88 , the reconnection rate enhancement is comparable to what is expected from scaling the symmetric simulations . for stronger asymmetry ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "the reconnection rate is still enhanced by the presence of plasmoids in the current sheet , but to less of a degree than for @xmath197 .",
    "scaling from the symmetric simulations to @xmath90 cases overpredicts the reconnection rate .",
    "we perform an onset study of the plasmoid instability for both symmetric and asymmetric inflow reconnection . for the symmetric case , we find that the critical lundquist number for the onset of the instability is @xmath198 .",
    "this is consistent with the canonical result that onset occurs when the lundquist number is of order @xmath199 .",
    "interestingly , we find that there exist domain sizes for which the symmetric case is stable but moderate asymmetry cases ( e.g. , @xmath200 ) are unstable .",
    "this suggests that moderate asymmetry has a destabilizing influence on the formation of plasmoids .",
    "however , our results indicate that strong asymmetry ( e.g. , @xmath191 ) has a stabilizing influence .",
    "we predict observational consequences for the asymmetric plasmoid instability in the solar atmosphere , laboratory experiments , and space plasmas .",
    "the most likely characteristics to be observed are the development of islands preferentially into the weak field upstream region and vorticity in the plasmoids . in the solar atmosphere",
    ", high spatial and temporal resolution will be required and projection effects will make interpretation difficult .",
    "future laboratory experiments may naturally have asymmetric inflow due to cylindrical geometry effects , although the asymmetry may be relatively modest . _ in situ _ observations of flux ropes formed during asymmetric inflow reconnection at earth s dayside magnetopause provide an opportunity to test predictions based on vorticity of secondary islands ; however , collisionless effects not included in our simulations are expected to be important . for all of these situations",
    ", discrepancies between simulations and observations will provide insight into the roles of three - dimensional and collisionless effects .",
    "our simulations of the plasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow reconnection hint at the nature of this instability in three dimensions .",
    "in particular , outflow jets from individual , small - scale reconnection sites are more likely to impact flux ropes obliquely rather than directly .",
    "this may cause momentum transport from the jets into the flux ropes to be less efficient and vorticity in the flux ropes to develop .",
    "vorticity in flux ropes may lead to shear flow stabilization when flux ropes merge .",
    "consequently , secondary merging of flux ropes formed by the plasmoid instability should not necessarily be assumed to be efficient ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "as in the downstream region of our asymmetric simulations , flux ropes will likely have additional freedom to roll around each other while merging or instead of merging .",
    "however , further study of the three - dimensional plasmoid instability will be required before solid conclusions can be drawn .",
    "there remain several open questions and promising areas of future work regarding the plasmoid instability during both symmetric and asymmetric inflow magnetic reconnection .",
    "thus far , no analytical theory exists that describes the linear properties of the plasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow reconnection ; however , the effects of asymmetry on the tearing mode have been investigated.@xcite the role of collisionless effects and the transition to collisionless reconnection have been investigated for the symmetric plasmoid instability @xcite but not for the asymmetric case . the role of three - dimensional effects during the plasmoid instability",
    "requires further study .",
    "additional investigation of the role of a guide field will provide more insight into real situations , especially for three - dimensional and fully kinetic simulations . statistical models of magnetic islands in current sheets @xcite will need to be extended in order to incorporate asymmetry and three - dimensional effects .",
