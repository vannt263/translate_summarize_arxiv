    "it has long been known that galaxies occur in different environments and many galactic properties depend on environment , e.g. , hubble type , color , and star formation rate .",
    "( see the extensive review by boselli & gavazzi 2006 and references therein . )",
    "this implies that some processes related to the environment must be at work .",
    "interaction with the icm , one of these processes , is likely to be dominant in clusters in the present universe ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "ram pressure , the drag force acting on the gas in a galaxy when it moves in the icm , can strip the cold ism down to the stripping radius beyond which the ram pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force .",
    "thus , ram pressure stripping can decrease the gas content , quench the global star formation rate ( sfr ) , and lead to a morphological transformation of the galaxy ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; vollmer et al .",
    "2001b ; crowl & kenney 2008 ; quilis et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , once the cold ism has been stripped out of the galaxy , it mixes with the hot icm and eventually becomes part of it .",
    "due to star formation in the galaxy , the ism initially should be metal rich , and stripping of this gas will enrich the icm .",
    "stripping of the ism can also contribute to the clumping of the icm , which will induce significant biases in observed icm profiles based on x - ray measurements , further affecting the use of clusters of galaxies as precise probes of cosmology ( nagai & lau 2011 ) . the stripped tails , with the rich range of microphysical processes occurring within them and at their interfaces with the icm ( e.g. , cowie & mckee 1977 ; nulsen 1982 ; roediger & hensler 2005 ; kapferer et al .",
    "2009 ; tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) , provide an excellent environment to study the baryonic physics which is crucial to understand structure formation and evolution .    since the first analytical discussion by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , much evidence for ram pressure stripping has been found , either by the deficit of h i gas ( e.g. , giovanelli & haynes 1985 ; cayatte et al .",
    "1994 ; vollmer et al .",

    "meanwhile , much theoretical work has been done with more realistic modeling of the galaxy structure and a fuller treatment of the processes , e.g. , multiphase ism ( tonnesen & bryan 2009 ) , varying winds ( schulz & struck 2001 ; roediger & br@xmath15ggen 2008b ) , star formation ( kronberger et al .",

    ", we presented the discovery of the spectacular x - ray tails attached to a late - type galaxy , , in the massive cluster a3627 .",
    "the tails are long ( @xmath16 kpc ) and narrow ( @xmath17 kpc ) with nearly constant widths and temperatures ( @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "star formation is active in the stripped gas , with many h ii regions and young star clusters ( s07 ; s10 ) .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the double tails extending well outside of the tidally truncated dark matter halo , making  the first late - type galaxy with long double x - ray tails ( s10 ) .",
    "s10 also presented the discovery of an x - ray tail and a h@xmath8 tail associated with another late - type galaxy in a3627 , , which are the focus of this paper .",

    "we adopt @xmath26 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath27@xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which yield a luminosity distance of 69.7 mpc to the galaxy and the scaling 1@xmath30 kpc .",

    "the effective exposure is 89.56 ks for the s3 chip . in the spectral analysis , a lower energy cutoff of 0.5 kev",

    "the spectral fits were performed with xspec .",
    "atomdb ( the atomic database adopted by xspec ) v2.0 released in 2011 includes significant changes of the fe l - shell data , which affect the spectral fits for @xmath33 kev plasma ( foster et al .  2012 ) .",
    "however , work published prior to 2011 used atomdb v1.3.1 or older versions , including s10 .",
    "therefore , the results with both atomdb v2.0.1 and atomdb v1.3.1 are listed . the c - statistic in xspec",
    "was adopted and uncertainties quoted are @xmath34 .",

    "the @xmath35 kev  count image is shown in panel * a * of figure 1 .",
    "point sources were removed and the point source regions were filled with the surrounding background .",
    "the image was smoothed by a gaussian kernel of 3@xmath36.94 to enhance the low surface brightness features .",
    "neither background subtraction nor exposure correction was applied , so as to show the raw data in a minimally processed way .",
    "a long tail towards the southeast is clearly seen from the image .",
    "the background subtracted and exposure corrected image in the @xmath35 kev band is in panel * d * of figure 1 , with the main features marked . at the upstream side of the tail , a sharp , flattened discontinuity ( edge ) @xmath3 kpc from the galaxy center ( taken as the location of the x - ray agn ) is clearly visible , which is also shown in the surface brightness profile along the tail in figure 2 .",
    "the tail is swollen at the base , with a linear scale of @xmath37 kpc for the widest part .",
    "then the tail narrows down and changes direction , extending straight for @xmath37 kpc .",
    "afterwards it changes direction again and stays straight for another @xmath38 kpc before curving in the direction to the cluster center and fading into the surrounding icm .",
    "the swollen section and two straight parts of the tail , with a total length of @xmath39 kpc in projection , are significantly above the local background , while the curved part is only a marginal feature ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the tail is narrow , with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath40 kpc obtained for a gaussian fit to the surface brightness profile across the tail ( figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the width along the tail does not increase ( i.e. , it does not flare ) .",
    "this is in disagreement with simulations which do not include cooling ( e.g. , roediger & br@xmath15ggen 2008b ; tonnesen & bryan 2010 ) . on the other hand , simulations with cooling",
    "produce significantly narrower and less flared tails ( e.g. , tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) , in better agreement with our observations .    figure 1 also shows the optical images from soar : the net h@xmath8 images are in panels * b * and * e * , while the optical continuum images are in panels * c * and * f*. the net h@xmath8 image in panel * b * was smoothed with a 1@xmath36.5 gaussian while that in panel * e * was smoothed with a 0@xmath36.6 gaussian .",
    "the  @xmath35 kev contours in red were overlaid on the images in panels * e * and * f*. panels * b * , * c * , * e * , and * f * all have the same size . because the cluster is very close to the galactic plane ,",
    "there are many foreground stars , as revealed in the optical continuum image .",
    "with the stars masked , the net h@xmath8 image shows a tail extending to @xmath9 kpc from the nucleus which spatially coincides with the x - ray tail .",
    "the x - ray leading edge also corresponds to the h@xmath8 edge ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these two facts imply that the x - ray tail and h@xmath8 tail are physically one tail detected in different bands .",
    "a striking feature revealed by the h@xmath8 image is the presence of a secondary tail to the southeast of the main tail .",
    "the secondary tail bifurcates at a distance of @xmath12 kpc from the nucleus and diverges by @xmath11 from the main tail , extending @xmath10 kpc before becoming too faint to be observed . at the location of the h@xmath8 secondary tail in the  image ,",
    "the x - ray emission is enhanced at the @xmath13 level . a longer observation would be required to confirm the possible x - ray double tails .",
    "we measured the gas temperatures in four regions along the x - ray tail , as shown in figure 4 . after excluding the central small circle ( 3@xmath36 in radius , centered on the x - ray agn ) from the green circle , we define the remainder as the `` head '' of the tail .",
    "the  head \" corresponds to the swollen part while the other three green boxes cover the two straight parts .",
    "emission from the curved part is so weak that we decided not to measure the temperature in this region .",
    "the background is from local source - free regions .",
    "we fitted the spectra with the single-@xmath6 ( single apec ) model with absorption fixed at the galactic value .",
    "the results are shown in the upper right of figure 4 .",
    "mixing of the stripped ism with the icm naturally leads to a multiphase distribution of gas in the tail , especially when turbulence exists .",
    "as the cluster background is quite high and the regions for extracting spectra are small , we chose to keep the model simple . from figure 4 ( upper right panel ) , the temperature variations are small ( within @xmath41 ) so the whole tail has a nearly constant temperature , which is similar to the x - ray tails of .",
    "the global tail region , defined as the three green boxes ( not including the `` head '' ) on the left of figure 4 , has a temperature of 0.95@xmath42 kev with the single-@xmath6 fit .",
    "however , the single-@xmath6 fit yields a very low abundance ( 0.18@xmath43 @xmath44 ) , which is a reflection of the multiphase nature of the gas . components ( with the average temperature of @xmath4 kev ) is fitted with the single-@xmath6 model , the fe abundance will be seriously biased low ( e.g. , buote 2000a , 2000b ) . for @xmath45 kev plasma ,",
    "the temperature is determined by the centroid of the fe - l hump .",
    "two or more @xmath6 components excite fe - l lines over a wider energy range than the single-@xmath6 model predicts , which means that the fe - l hump is broader than the single-@xmath6 model predicts . in order for the single-@xmath6 model to better fit the spectrum",
    ", one has to reduce the size of the peak of the single-@xmath6 model , i.e. , the fe abundance , as well as to increase the bremsstrahlung continuum ( buote 2000b ; b@xmath46hringer & werner 2010 ) . as a result",
    ", the abundance will be biased low , since the abundance for @xmath4 kev gas in apec is essentially determined by the fe abundance .",
    "studies of cool - core clusters and groups have shown that the abundance increases when a double-@xmath6 model or more complicated differential emission models are used ( e.g. , buote et al .",
    "2003 ; werner et al .  2006 ) . ]",
    "since the gas in the tail is multiphase in nature , we also tried double-@xmath6 ( double apec ) and multi-@xmath6 ( cemekl ) models for spectral fitting .",
    "the results , as well as those with the single-@xmath6 model , are shown in table 2 , in which we also list the fitting results for the `` head '' and the nucleus , defined as the small circle excluded from the `` head '' . to compare with the x - ray tails of  in our previous work ( s10 )",
    ", we also list the fitting results with atomdb v1.3.1 , which was used in that work .",
    "figure 5 shows the spectral fit with a double-@xmath6 model .",
    "the single-@xmath6 fit gives a temperature of 0.95@xmath42 kev , which can be compared with the s10 result , @xmath47 kev .",
    "the new data allow a better constraint on the local background , which results in a more accurate and better constrained temperature measurement .    the unfolded spectrum ( i.e. , deconvolved with the instruments response under a given model ) of the nucleus is displayed in figure 6 .",
    "a redshifted iron k@xmath8 fluorescence line at @xmath48 kev is present , with an equivalent width of 0.16@xmath49 kev .",
    "the nucleus is luminous , with a bolometric luminosity of 1.2@xmath50 erg s@xmath21 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "a bolometric correction factor of 15 is adopted from vasudevan & fabian ( 2007 ) .",
    "the high column density , @xmath51 @xmath32 , confirms that  hosts an obscured agn .",
    "nishino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report the detection of excess hard x - ray emission from the center of a3627 with .",
    "they checked the hard x - ray flux from a seyfert-1 galaxy , igr j16119 - 6036 ( wkk 6092 ) , and concluded that this flux is @xmath52 times too small to explain the observed hard x - ray emission as combination of the thermal emission from the icm and a power - law from the seyfert-1 galaxy .",
    "since  hosts a luminous agn , we compare its hard x - ray ( @xmath53 kev ) flux by extrapolating the  spectrum to that from igr j16119 - 6036 , and find that it is @xmath54 times smaller .",
    "therefore , the hard x - rays from both igr j16119 - 6036 and  are insufficient to fully account for the hard excess reported by nishino et al .",
    "the spectral properties of the icm surrounding the tail were also examined . as the cluster emission and the x - ray background fill the whole chip , we used the stowed background , normalized to our observation in the @xmath55 kev band , to subtract the non - x - ray background . following sun ( 2009 ) , we modeled the x - ray background with three components : a power - law with a photon index of 1.5 and an apec thermal model , both with galactic absorption , and an unabsorbed apec thermal model with a fixed temperature of 0.1 kev .",
    "both apec thermal models had zero redshift and solar abundances .",
    "another absorbed apec thermal model with galactic absorption was added to describe the cluster emission .",
    "the spectra of the icm in 7 regions were extracted and then fitted together ( excluding # 6 as it covers the curved part of the x - ray tail ) in order to increase the signal to noise ratio , which gives a temperature of 7.08@xmath56 kev and an abundance of 0.13@xmath57 @xmath44 . with the abundances fixed at this overall value ,",
    "the spectra from the 7 individual regions were fitted separately .",
    "the results are shown in the lower right panel of figure 4 .",
    "clearly , region # 6 has the lowest temperature , which is probably due to the contamination by the remaining cold ism .",
    "this suggests that the tail is long and continues out to this region .    in order to derive the properties of the icm near , we estimated the density of the icm using the @xmath58 model profile for the cluster , @xmath59 , derived by b@xmath46hringer et al .",
    "the cluster center was taken to be the x - ray surface brightness peak ( 16:14:22 , -60:52:20 ) as given in the same paper .",
    "the parameters for a 3627 are @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . assuming the cluster - centric distance of  is the projected distance ( 110 kpc , see section 5.1 for a further discussion ) , the electron density of the icm at the position of the galaxy is @xmath64 @xmath61 .",
    "the thermal pressure and ram pressure acting on  are @xmath65 dyn @xmath32 and @xmath66 dyn @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the tail of  is single - sided and our deep soar @xmath67-band image does not reveal any tidal features , so tidal interactions can be ruled out .",
    "ram pressure stripping is the most likely mechanism to produce the observed tail .",
    "a3627 is not relaxed and is probably undergoing a merger with a subcluster to the southeast of the main body of the cluster ( b@xmath46hringer et al .",
    "1996 ; nishino et al .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the galaxies and the icm in the cluster are complex , which is reflected by the projected configuration of s tail with respect to the cluster and the galaxy .",
    "the angle between the x - ray tail and the direction to the cluster center ( taken as the x - ray peak ) is @xmath68 , so the galaxy is currently moving away from the cluster center in the plane of the sky .",
    "meanwhile , the line - of - sight velocity of the galaxy with respect to the cluster is 872 km s@xmath21 , suggesting that along the line - of - sight , the galaxy is either approaching the cluster center from the front , or moving away from the cluster center from the behind . the orbit of the galaxy can be constrained further by the early stage of stripping of   as discussed below .",
    "targeted simulations will be required to fully explore the orbit of , but such simulations are beyond the scope of this paper .    despite the complexity of the dynamics , two observational results indicate that most of s current motion is probably in the plane of the sky . first , the 3-dimensional velocity dispersion in the inner @xmath69 abell radius ( 0.67 mpc ) of the cluster is @xmath70 km s@xmath21 ( woudt et al .",
    "2008 ) . taking this value",
    "as the 3-dimensional velocity of the galaxy , the velocity in the plane of the sky is @xmath71 km s@xmath21 , significantly larger than the line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath72 km s@xmath21 ) .",
    "second , the leading edge is very sharp ( figures 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that we are viewing the stagnation region directly .",
    "if so , the angle between the motion and the plane of the sky can not be large ( e.g. , mazzotta et al .",
    "2001 ; markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 ) .",
    "as the direction of the tail is opposite to the motion , the tail probably lies approximately in the plane of the sky , so the length of the tail should be close to its projected value .",
    "it is also likely that  is closer to the center of the cluster than , and is , in fact , not too far beyond its projected radius .",
    "a comparison of the surface brightness of the x - ray tails of  and  ( figure 2 and figure 5 of s10 ) shows that the emissivity of the gas in s tail is higher than that in s tail .",
    "this implies that the pressure around s tail is higher than that around s tail ( tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) .",
    "thus ,  is probably closer to the cluster center than . since the cluster - centric distance of  is close to 180 kpc ( s10 )",
    ", this means that the cluster - centric distance of  is probably less than 180 kpc ( the projected distance is 110 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , both the length of the tail and the cluster - centric distance of  should be close to their projected values .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray tail ( figure 1 ) is affected by the galactic potential , the strength of the ram pressure and the cluster gravitational field .",
    "the swollen part of the tail may largely be due to the complex potential of the galaxy , while the second straight part should be aligned with the direction of the icm flow relative to the galaxy ( the wind ) .",
    "the first straight part is a consequence of the wind s ram pressure and the restoring force of the galaxy . to push gas outward in the disk ,",
    "the drag force per unit mass needs to exceed the central acceleration @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the circular velocity and @xmath75 is the distance to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the restoring force per unit mass perpendicular to the disk is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the surface mass density of the disk . therefore ,",
    "if the drag force per unit mass @xmath78 , acts at an angle @xmath79 to the plane of the disk , at the point where the gas just leaves the disk , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "eliminating @xmath78 , this gives the surface density of the disk at that point , @xmath82 .",
    "taking @xmath83 and @xmath84 kpc from figure 1 , and assuming @xmath85 km s@xmath21 , we get @xmath86 @xmath87 pc@xmath88 , which is close to the surface mass density ( @xmath89 @xmath87 pc@xmath88 ) that binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) give for the milky way in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this agreement is expected , as  is a milky - way - like galaxy and the distance of the point where the gas just leaves the disk to the galaxy s center is close to the sun s distance to the galactic center , so the resulting stellar surface density should be comparable .",
    "this in turn implies that our simple argument is reasonable .",
    "the curved part is probably caused by sinking of the stripped gas due to the gravitational field of the cluster .",
    "the mass of the x - ray tail can be estimated if some approximations are made .",
    "if we assume the configuration of the tail can be represented by a cylinder with a length of 40 kpc and radius of 1.5 kpc , and the gas in the tail is homogeneous and the emission can be well described by the single-@xmath6 model , utilizing the normalization of the spectral fit , we can derive a total mass of @xmath90 @xmath87 , where @xmath91 is the filling factor of the soft x - ray emitting gas .",
    "applying the same approach to the individual regions gives a total mass of @xmath92 @xmath87 .",
    "this is a lower limit of the total mass of the tail , as we only account for the x - ray bright part of the tail and this mass is only the mass of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "s10 estimated a total ism mass of the galaxy to be @xmath93 @xmath87 initially .",
    "thus , the x - ray tail accounts for @xmath94 of the initial ism mass , which is very small given the high ram pressure .",
    "numerical simulations often show that large fractions ( 80% or even higher ) of the gas are stripped out of galaxies ( e.g. , kapferer et al .",
    "2009 ; tonnesen & bryan 2009 ) after a sufficiently long time .",
    "the low mass in the x - ray tail suggests that a large fraction of the ism may be still in the disk . actually , with two pointings toward , jchym et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) found @xmath95 @xmath87 of molecular gas in the galaxy with the atacama pathfinder experiment telescope ( apex ) .",
    "thus ,  is probably at an early stage of stripping .",
    "the mass of the h@xmath8 tails can be estimated as follows .",
    "the h@xmath8 tails can be approximated as three cylinders centered at ( 16:13:36.53 , -60:52:13.4 ) , ( 16:13:38.06 , -60:52:43.7 ) , and ( 16:13:39.42 , -60:52:41.9 ) ( j2000 ) , respectively .",
    "the dimensions of the three cylinders are @xmath96 kpc , @xmath97 kpc , and @xmath98 kpc ( radius@xmath99length ) , respectively .",
    "while the first cylinder is still in the stellar disk of the galaxy , the other two cylinders represent the two tails after the bifurcation point and are beyond the stellar disk .",
    "the surface brightness of the h@xmath8 emission was measured .",
    "we corrected the h@xmath8 flux for the [ n ii ] lines by assuming that the combined strength of the [ n ii ] lines was 30% of the h@xmath8 line .",
    "no intrinsic absorption was assumed .",
    "the average h@xmath8 surface brightness in the three regions is 10@xmath100 erg s@xmath21 @xmath32 arcsec@xmath88 , 2.3@xmath100 erg s@xmath21 @xmath32 arcsec@xmath88 , and 1.0@xmath100 erg s@xmath21 @xmath32 arcsec@xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the total h@xmath8 flux from the three regions is 2.9@xmath101 erg s@xmath21 @xmath32 , but 73% of the flux comes from the first region which is still in the stellar disk .",
    "this total flux can be compared with that from s h@xmath8 tails , 4.4@xmath101 erg s@xmath21 @xmath32 ( s07 ) . to estimate the mass of the h@xmath8 emitting gas , we assume an electron temperature of @xmath102 k and an effective recombination coefficient for h@xmath8 of @xmath103 @xmath104 s@xmath21 from the case b nebular theory ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) . the derived electron density is @xmath105 @xmath61 , where @xmath106 is the volume filling factor of the h@xmath8 emitting gas .",
    "the total mass is @xmath107 @xmath87 ( the mass of the three parts is @xmath108 @xmath87 , @xmath109 @xmath87 , and @xmath110 @xmath87 , respectively ) .",
    "numerical simulations of ram pressure stripping indicate that bright h@xmath8 emission is produced at the edges of dense neutral clouds ( tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) .",
    "thus , the volume filling factor should be small . while the observed root mean square ( rms ) electron density in the tail of  is @xmath111 @xmath61 ( s07 ) , in simulations ( with the icm thermal pressure consistent with that around ) , the typical local density of the h@xmath8 gas is @xmath4 @xmath61 ( tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) . thus , the volume filling factor in this case is about 0.2% .",

    "first , the normalization of the spectral fit , and hence the electron density and pressure , is very sensitive to the unknown abundance .",
    "this is due to the fact that at these temperatures , most of the x - ray emission is due to lines from heavy elements .",
    "for example , with the single-@xmath6 fit , when the abundance is 0.18 @xmath123 ( best - fit ) , 0.5@xmath123 , and 1@xmath123 , respectively , the pressure in the tail is @xmath114 dyn @xmath32 , @xmath124 dyn @xmath32 , and @xmath125 dyn @xmath32 , accordingly .",
    "note that a higher abundance , which is more reasonable for , significantly reduces the gas pressure in the tail .",
    "second , the lower thermal pressure in the icm may imply that other sources of pressure are important ( e.g. , magnetic pressure ) .",
    "adopting @xmath114 dyn @xmath32 and @xmath65 dyn @xmath32 for the pressures in the tail and in the icm , respectively , and assuming a filling factor of 1 , we acquire a magnetic field strength of @xmath38 @xmath126 g at the position of the tail in a3627 , which is larger than typical values of a few @xmath126 g in clusters .",

    "last but not least , so far we have assumed that the soft x - ray emission is of thermal origin , but charge exchange may also produce a fraction of the observed soft x - ray flux emission , but we only introduce it here as a possible mechanism to produce some of the soft x - ray emission , in order to explain the apparent higher pressure in the tail .",

    "this limit is almost four orders of magnitude larger than the observed flux in the @xmath130 kev band .",
    "note that in the above crude upper limit , we used the whole tail volume , which is much larger than the true volume where charge exchange takes place , as this process only occurs roughly at the interface of the hot and cold gas .",
    "so the true flux due to charge exchange would be much smaller than this limit .",
    "nevertheless , this suggests that charge exchange may potentially contribute to the observed soft x - ray flux , and hence reduce the derived pressure in the tail .    in summary , the uncertainties in the abundance , thermal vs. non - thermal x - ray emission , or magnetic support in the icm may cause the pressure in the tail to appear to be higher than that in the icm .",

    "the x - ray emission comes from mixing of cold gas stripped from the galaxy with the hot icm and is not localized near the dense clouds , in contrast to the h@xmath8 emission which peaks at the edges of the neutral clouds so it traces their distribution ( tonnesen & bryan 2011 ) .",

    "consequently , it is a good case to study the influence of inclination on the behavior of ram pressure stripping , including mass loss ( roediger & br@xmath15ggen 2006 ) , the gas distribution , and sfr in the tail ( section 5.4 ) .",
    "second , it is known that bright x - ray tails are rare for late - type galaxies ( s10 ) .",
    "the discovery of s x - ray tail provides new constraints on the origin of x - ray bright tails ( section 5.4 ) , and may provide some clues on why x - ray tails are so rare .",
    "third , the fact that the x - ray tails of both  and  have very narrow and nearly uniform widths , constant and similar temperatures , `` low abundances '' , and are apparently `` over - pressured '' compared to the surrounding icm ( section 5.3 ) may indicate that they are common features for x - ray tails of late - type galaxies .",
    "the explanation of these features may depend on the details of microphysical processes , which also are the central problems in other astrophysical fields ( e.g. , cool - cores , agn feedback , and icm physics ) .",
    "fourth , the double - tail features require refined modeling of galaxies ( e.g. , including spiral arms ) and the inclusion of magnetic fields both in the intracluster and interstellar space ( section 5.4 ) . ultimately , more data and more sophisticated simulations are required to study in detail the stripping process and gas evolution in the stripped tails , which have important implications for galaxy evolution and baryonic physics .",
