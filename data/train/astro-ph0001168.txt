    "the recent released third catalog of high - energy @xmath1-ray sources by the egret telescope on the compton gamma - ray observatory contains 66 high - confidence identifications of blazars and 27 lower - confidence potential blazar identifications ( hartman et al .",
    "the @xmath1-ray blazars are relativistically beamed and have strong jet components .",
    "the inverse compton scattering is the most promising process responsible for the @xmath1-ray emission ( marscher & gear 1985 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ; ghisellini & madau 1996 ; bttcher & dermer 1998 ) .",
    "all @xmath1-ray agns identified by egret are radio - loud with flat spectrum , but not all flat - spectrum agns are detectable @xmath1-ray sources .",
    "one possibility is that the beaming cone for @xmath1-ray emission is narrower than that for radio emission . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1-ray emission could be beamed away from the line of sight , but the radio emission is still doppler boosted due to a wider beaming cone ( von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the apparent position angle difference @xmath0pa between parsec and kilo - parsec jets can be related to the bending properties of the jets .",
    "many authors have investigated the misalignment angle distributions for the different samples of radio sources ( pearson & readhead 1988 ; conway & murphy 1993 ; appl et al .",
    "1996 ; tingay et al .",
    "if the angle between the relativistic jet and the line of the sight is small , the projection effect of beaming can amplify the intrinsic bend of the jet ( conway & murphy 1993 ) .",
    "several effects such as motion of the host galaxy , collision of the jet with clouds , or precession of the central engine , can thereby cause the bend .",
    "recently , the concept of jet - disc symbiosis was introduced and the inhomogeneous jet model plus mass and energy conservation in the jet - disc system was applied to study the relation between disc and jet luminosities ( falcke & biermann 1995 ; falcke et al . 1995 ; falcke & biermann 1999 ) .",
    "an effective approach to study the link between these two phenomena is to explore the relationship between luminosity in line emission and kinetic power of jets in different scales ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ) .",
    "rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) derived the total jet kinetic power @xmath2 and found a correlation between @xmath2 and the narrow line luminosity @xmath3 . similar correlations between line and radio emission have also been found by some authors ( cao & jiang 1999 ; xu et al .",
    "1999 ; willott et al .",
    "the optical line region is photoionized by a nuclear source ( probably radiation from the disk ) , so the optical line emission is a better accretion power indicator than the optical continuum radiation may be enhanced by relativistically beamed synchrotron radiation for some flat - spectrum quasars ( celotti et al .",
    "the extended radio emission which is not affected by beaming may reflect the jet power @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the ratio of extended radio to broad - line flux reflects the ratio of jet power to accretion power . in this work",
    ", we present correlations between the misalignment @xmath0pa and the ratio of radio to broad - line emission for a sample of @xmath1-ray blazars . in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the sample of sources .",
    "the results are contained in sect .",

    "complete information on the line spectra is available for very few sources in our sample , since different lines are observed for the sources at different redshifts . we have to estimate the total broad - line flux from the available observational data .",
    "there is not a solidly established procedure to derive the total broad - line flux and we therefore adopt the method proposed by celotti et al .",
    "the following lines : ly@xmath5 , civ , mgii , h@xmath1 , h@xmath6 and h@xmath5 , which contribute the major parts in the total broad - line emissions , are used in our estimate .",
    "we use the line ratios reported by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and add the contribution from line h@xmath5 to derive the total broad - line flux ( see celotti et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",
    "we then search the literature to collect data on broad - line fluxes .",
    "we only consider values of line fluxes ( or luminosities ) given directly or the equivalent width and the continuum flux density at the corresponding line frequency which are reported together in the literature . when more than one value of the same line flux was found in the literature , we take the most recent reference .",
    "we start with the @xmath1-ray blazars identified by hartman et al.(1999 ) including lower - confidence blazars .",
    "there are 79 agns with available redshifts in the third egret catalog . among these sources ,",
    "we search the literature extensively and find 44 sources with sufficient line data to estimate the total broad - line flux .",
    "the remainder of the sources that lack broad - line flux data include 9 bl lac objects and 26 quasars .",
    "the broad - line fluxes have not been measured due to weak line emission for the bl lac objects .",
    "the situation for the quasars is quite different from the bl lac objects .",
    "we note that the spectroscopic observations for most of these 26 quasars have been performed .",
    "however , the line data of these quasars are usually incomplete , i.e. , only the equivalent width , line profile or line - to - continuum ratio is given , but the continuum flux density at the given frequency is not available probably due to the specific purpose of the literature or the problem of calibration .",
    "only a bit more than half of the @xmath1-ray sources with known redshifts have sufficient data , such that the total broad - line flux can be estimated .",
    "this is similar to the situation in cao & jiang ( 1999 ) . in their work ,",
    "198 sources within the starting sample of 378 sources have suitable data to derive the total broad - line flux .",
    "no evidence shows that the lack of broad - line flux for these sources would affect the main results of present analyses , though it leads to a highly incomplete sample for present study .",
    "the further spectroscopic observations on these sources would be helpful .",
    "we collect the data of all sources with both the broad - line flux and the misalignment angle @xmath0pa between parsec and kilo - parsec jets , which leads to a sample of 34 blazars ( we add the tev @xmath1-ray objects : mkn501 to the sample , which is not listed in the egret catalog ) .",
    "there are 26 quasars and 8 bl lac objects in this sample , in which 7 sources are lower - confidence potential blazar identifications and two tev @xmath1-ray objects : mkn421 and mkn501 .",
    "the broad - line data are listed in table 1 .",
    "we compile the data of the extended radio flux density at 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source in column ( 9 ) of table 1 .",
    "the data given at the wavelength other than 5 ghz are k - corrected to 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source assuming @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we also give the core flux density data at two different frequencies for each source in the sample , and a two - point spectral index is then derived for the core of the source .",
    "the core flux density at 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source is available by k - correction .",
    "the misalignment between kilo - parsec and parsec jets @xmath0pa are taken from the literature .",
    "for a few sources , different values of @xmath0pa are given by different authors usually due to the complex jet structures .",
    "we take the minimum @xmath0pa for these sources .",
    "all data of the core flux density and the misalignment angle @xmath0pa are given in table 2 .",
    "the misalignment angle @xmath0pa is given by the comparison between the vla and vlbi maps .",
    "we note that only one position angle ( vla or vlbi ) is available for some sources .",
    "only the vla position angle is available for the sources 0414@xmath9189 and 0954 + 556 .",
    "there are five sources : 0454@xmath9234 , 1504@xmath9166 , 1741@xmath9038 , 2200 + 420 and 2320@xmath9035 ,",
    "of which only the vlbi position angle is available .",
    "one reason is that these sources are too compact .",
    "high dynamic range vla maps of many sources sufficient to reveal weak kilo - parsec structure are not available .",
    "therefore , further radio observations on these sources might reveal their misalignment information .",
    "further spectroscopic observations are also necessary to complete the sample .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0pa of the sample is plotted in fig . 1 and appears bimodal , which is similar to that given by pearson & readhead ( 1988 ) .",
    "such distribution can be explained by projection of the helical jet ( conway & murphy 1993 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the relation between the apparent misalignment @xmath0pa and the ratio of the total radio flux at 5 ghz to the broad - line flux .",
    "the radio flux density is k - corrected to the rest frame of the source .",
    "a correlation is found at 99.9 per cent significant level for the whole sample using spearman s correlation coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "a slightly less significant correlation is present for quasars in the sample .",
    "we also find a significant correlation between @xmath0pa and the ratio of the vlbi core flux to the broad - line flux at the level 99.99 per cent , where the vlbi core flux density is also k - corrected to the rest frame of the source at 5 ghz ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the relation between the apparent misalignment @xmath0pa and the ratio of the extended radio flux at 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source to the broad - line flux .",
    "a weak correlation at 90 per cent significance shows that a trend for sources with higher ratios have larger misalignment @xmath0pa .    in present sample ,",
    "there are two tev @xmath1-ray sources : mkn421 ( 1101 + 384 ) and mkn501 ( 1652 + 398 ) . we know that the three tev @xmath1-ray objects are quite different from other @xmath1-ray sources ( coppi & aharonian 1999a , b ) .",
    "only mkn421 is listed in the third egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "however , we can not find obvious different behaviours for these two tev @xmath1-ray objects from the remains in the sample ( see figs .",
    "2 @xmath9 4 , labeled by large squares ) .",
    "the redshifts of the sources in our sample ranges from 0.031 to 2.286 , which means that the spatial resolution of vla and vlbi are very different .",
    "however , the angular resolution is about same for these sources , which would probably affect the correlation analyses ( appl et al .",
    "we therefore group the sources into low ( z@xmath110.5 ) and high ( z@xmath120.5 ) redshift objects . for the latter , the angular to linear",
    "scale mapping is approximately constant .",
    "we re - analyze the correlations and find a correlation between @xmath0pa and the ratio of the radio core flux to the broad - line flux at 99.94 per cent significant level for the 24 objects with z@xmath120.5 .",
    "recently , serjeant et al . ( 1998 ) found a correlation between radio and optical continuum emission for a sample of steep - spectrum radio quasars that is evidence for a link between accretion process and jet power their sample is limited to the steep - spectrum quasars to reduce the doppler beaming effect in the optical waveband .",
    "a similar correlation is given by carballo et al ( 1999 ) for the b3-vla sample .",
    "cao & jiang ( 1999 ) present a correlation between radio and broad - line emission for a sample of radio quasars including both flat - spectrum and steep - spectrum quasars .",
    "they adopted the broad - line emission instead of the optical continuum in their investigation to avoid the beaming effect on optical emission .",
    "the jet power @xmath2 is proportional to the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , and also depends on the size of the jet and the particle density in the jet ( celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "the apparent misalignment may be affected by the angle between the direction of vlbi jet and the sight line if the angle is small ( conway & murphy 1993 ) .",
    "the total radio flux density and vlbi core flux density are both strongly increased by beaming in core - dominated radio blazars .",
    "the sources with higher ratio may therefore have higher doppler factors .",
    "so , the correlations between @xmath0pa and @xmath13 or @xmath14 can be explained by the beaming effects .",
    "impey et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that the sources with higher fractional optical polarization tend to have relatively larger misalignment @xmath0pa between vlbi and parsec structures , which is consistent with both large apparent misalignments and optical fractional polarization being correlated with large beaming and small angles to the line of sight .",
    "the extended radio emission may also be correlated to the jet power @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . if this is true , the ratio of the extended radio flux to the broad - line flux may reflect the ratio of the jet power to the disk luminosity : @xmath15 .",
    "the weak correlation between @xmath0pa and the ratio of extended radio to broad - line flux might imply that the intrinsic bend of the jet is related with the ratio of jet mechanical power to accretion power .",
    "jets in quasars may be powered by rotating black holes in the nuclei ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; moderski et al .",
    "the jet power @xmath2 is then related to the rotational energy of the black hole according to the bz mechanism .",
    "hence , the ratio of radio to broad - line flux might be related to the angular momentum of the black hole to some extent . also , we know that the variation of the rotation axis of the black hole caused by the lense - thirring effect can result in a change of the orientation of the nuclei jet ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ; scheuer & feiler 1996 ) , which may lead to the different ejected orientations between small and large scale jets .",
    "the faster rotating black hole may cause the jet ejected orientation changing more rapidly , which leads to a larger intrinsic bend of the jet .",
    "more recently , ghosh & abramowicz ( 1997 ) , livio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that the electromagnetic output from the inner disc is generally expected to dominate over that from the hole .",
    "if this is the case for the @xmath1-ray agns , the jet power @xmath2 from the disc is mainly determined by the poloidal magnetic field @xmath16 at the disc surface . a tentative explanation on the relation in fig .",
    "is that both bending and the jet power could be increased by having large magnetic fields in the accretion disk .",
    "the further study on this problem for a larger sample of core - dominated radio quasars will be in our future work , and we can then check whether the correlations are properties only of egret sources or of all blazars in general .",
