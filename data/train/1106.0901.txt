    "6 . there is not suddenly mutative in the diagram , but the maximum value of each plot becomes small with the size of the system largening . while we can also get the linear behavior between the maximum of @xmath98 and the corresponding size of system which is plotted in fig . 7 .",

    "the anisotropy and dm interaction parameters determined the phase diagrams of the model .  if the anisotropy parameter was small , the concurrence depended on the dm interaction , else the anisotropy parameter played an important role .",
