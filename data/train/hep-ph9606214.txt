    "quantum electrodynamics in 2 space- and 1 time - dimension , qed3 , has several interesting features .",
    "it exhibits dynamical mass generation @xcite and confinement @xcite , similar to qcd .",
    "furthermore , it is superrenormalizable , so it does not suffer from the ultraviolet divergences which are present in qed4 .",
    "the coupling constant is dimensionful , and provides us with a mass scale , even if we consider massless fermions .",
    "this energy scale plays the role of the qcd scale @xmath1 , in the sense that it sets the scale for confinement and dynamical mass generation .",
    "thus it is a very interesting model to study these nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "qed3 also has some applications in condensed matter physics , where it can be regarded as an effective theory for more realistic microscopic models @xcite .",
    "especially , since the discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity and the fractional quantum hall effect , these kinds of models have attracted more attention .    in this paper , we consider qed3 with @xmath3 fermion flavors of four - component spinors .",
    "such a model of qed3 is chirally symmetric in the absence of a bare fermion mass term , @xmath4 , in contrast to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory with two - component fermions , where we can not define chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "similar to the four - dimensional case @xcite , the chiral symmetry of qed3 may be broken spontaneously due to the dynamical generation of a fermion mass . the question of whether or not chiral symmetry is broken for all values of @xmath3 , the number of fermion flavors , is very interesting .",
    "we address this question by analyzing the behavior of the full fermion propagator nonperturbatively , using its dyson  schwinger equation .",
    "however , this equation can not be solved without truncating the infinite set of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations , since it involves the full photon propagator and the full vertex function .",
    "different ways of truncating this equation give rise to different results concerning the question of whether there is a critical number of fermion flavors for dynamical mass generation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we try to resolve the controversy .    using the bare vertex approximation and the one - loop vacuum polarization , appelquist _",
    "@xcite have shown that there is a finite critical number of flavors @xmath5 , above which the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "they found in landau gauge a critical value of @xmath6 .",
    "this approach is based on a @xmath7 expansion , and including the next - to - leading - order terms @xcite , it was found that the critical number changes to @xmath8 .",
    "however , such a simple treatment was criticized by pennington _",
    "@xcite , since the effects of the wavefunction renormalization were not taken into account .",
    "the problem is that formally the wavefunction renormalization is of order @xmath9 , but in the infrared region , this wavefunction renormalization tends to vanish . because of this non - uniformity in the @xmath7 expansion , an approximation based on an expansion in @xmath7 might not be very reliable .",
    "taking into account wavefunction renormalization , pennington _",
    "found chiral symmetry breaking for all numbers of fermion flavors .",
    "however , as we show , their approach also has some inconsistency",
    ".    there have been several attempts to resolve the problem , by means of more sophisticated anstze for the full vertex @xcite , and by use of a so - called nonlocal gauge - function @xcite , but none of them are completely satisfactorily .",
    "also other methods , such as the inversion method @xcite , @xmath10-expansion @xcite , and lattice calculations @xcite , have not given a final answer to this question , although the lattice results favor the existence of a finite critical number of fermion flavors @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that it is numerically very difficult to observe the exponential decrease of the dynamical mass for increasing @xmath3 found in @xcite .    in our paper , the existence of a finite critical number of flavors",
    "is confirmed by analyzing the _ coupled _ dyson  schwinger equations , for both the fermion and the photon propagator , using several different approximations for the full vertex .",
    "we show that , within a certain class of vertex anstze , there is a critical number of fermion flavors for dynamical mass generation in qed3 .",
    "this number does not depend very strongly on the precise form of the vertex ansatz .",
    "also the general behavior of the fermion propagator does not depend on the exact details of the ansatz .",
    "the essential point is to take into account the full vacuum polarization in a consistent way .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the formalism in more detail , together with our truncation scheme . before addressing the question of chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "we first analyze the full fermion propagator in the massless phase , see sec .",
    "[ secsymphase ] .",
    "this already yields some nontrivial results , namely that the structure of the massless full fermion propagator is almost independent of our ansatz . in sec .",
    "[ secbroken ] , we discuss dynamical mass generation , and show that there is a critical number of fermion flavors for chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath11 , almost independent of our choice for the vertex . finally we give some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ secconc ] .",
    "we consider qed3 with @xmath3 massless fermion flavors , and choose to work in euclidean space , ignoring the issues discussed in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian in a general covariant gauge is given by @xmath12 we use four - component spinors for the fermions , and accordingly a four - dimensional representation for the @xmath13-matrices .",
    "with such a representation we can define chirality just as in four - dimensional qed .",
    "this chiral symmetry can be broken dynamically by generation of a mass for the fermions . in this formulation",
    ", there can also be a parity breaking mass term , which conserves the chiral symmetry , but it is known that such a mass is not generated dynamically @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath3 fermion flavors , and consider both the large @xmath3 limit , as well as the quenched limit , @xmath14 . in the quenched limit",
    ", the mass scale is defined by the dimensionful coupling constant @xmath15 , and there are no free parameters . outside the quenched limit , @xmath3 ,",
    "the number of fermion flavors is the only free parameter .",
    "when using the large @xmath3 expansion @xcite , we keep the product @xmath16 finite , and it is most convenient to define the mass scale by @xmath17      the dyson ",
    "schwinger ( ds ) equation for the fermion propagator is given by @xmath18 since parity is not broken dynamically , we can decompose the fermion propagator into @xmath19 and rewrite the ds equation into @xmath20\\ , , \\\\",

    "we also have a ds equation , namely @xmath21 without introducing new unknown functions .",
    "it is more convenient to write this last expression in terms of the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath22 @xmath23 since the longitudinal part of the photon propagator is not affected by the interactions , because of gauge invariance , we can write the full photon propagator in a general covariant gauge @xmath24 with the vacuum polarization @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 the vacuum polarization tensor has an ultraviolet divergence , which can be removed by a gauge - invariant regularization scheme .",
    "however , this divergence is only present in the longitudinal part , so by contracting @xmath22 with @xmath27 we can project out the finite vacuum polarization @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "so , the coupled ds equations for the photon and fermion propagator form a set of three coupled equations for three scalar functions , and the only unknown function is the full vertex function . note that both the ds equation for the fermion propagator , and the one for the photon propagator , are exact .    in principle ,",
    "we could write down a ds equation for the full vertex function as well , but this will not lead to a closed set of equations : the ds equation for the vertex involves a four - point function , and so on . the full set of ds equations forms an infinite hierarchy of coupled integral equations for the green s functions . in order to solve the ds equation for a particular green s function",
    ", we have to truncate or approximate this infinite set of equations . for calculating the propagators , we must find a reasonable approximation for the full vertex function @xmath28 .",
    "now , what is a reasonable approximation for the full vertex function ? the most simple and in some sense `` natural '' approximation is to take the leading order perturbative vertex @xmath29 this truncation is commonly used in studies of the fermion ds equation , and it is usually referred to as ladder or rainbow approximation , since it generates rainbow diagrams in the fermion ds equation , and ladder diagrams in the bethe - salpeter equation for the fermion ",
    "anti - fermion bound state amplitude . in principle there is a systematic way to improve this truncation , namely by taking the next - to - leading order vertex function , and so on .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of this approach is that it relies on perturbation theory , whereas the ds equations are nonperturbative equations . until one performs the complete next - to - leading order calculation",
    ", one does not know how reliable the leading order calculation is . even after obtaining such a next - to - leading order",
    ", there remains some doubt about the validity of this approach , due to the non - uniformity of the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "furthermore , as a consequence on the one hand of using a nonperturbative method to calculate some green s functions , and on the other hand of employing perturbation theory for other green s functions , one violates the ward  takahashi ( wt ) identities relating these green s functions , and loses gauge covariance . to be specific",
    ", the wt identity relating the full vertex to the fermion propagator @xmath30 is an exact identity , which holds order - by - order in perturbation theory , but if one uses perturbation theory to approximate the full vertex , and the truncated ds equation to calculate the fermion propagator , one will ( in general ) violate this identity .    instead of using a perturbative approximation for the vertex function",
    ", one can also use other nonperturbative information to make an ansatz for the full vertex .",
    "the full vertex can be decomposed into 12 different lorentz structures , and four of them are uniquely determined by the wt identity @xcite .",
    "so by imposing the wt identity , we can write the full vertex as @xmath31 where the dots represent the part of the vertex not constrained by the wt identity .",
    "now one can simply neglect that unconstrained part , and take the above expression as ansatz ( usually called ball ",
    "chiu vertex ) for the full vertex .",
    "however , a perturbative calculation shows that the unconstrained part is not zero @xcite , and by just neglecting it you never see what you are throwing away .",
    "the wt identity is not the only requirement one can impose on the full vertex function .",
    "other requirements are that it reduces to the bare vertex in the weak coupling limit , and multiplicative renormalizability also restricts the full vertex , even in a superrenormalizable theory like qed3 .",
    "furthermore , any ansatz should have the correct symmetry properties .",
    "however , all these constraints do not uniquely determine the full vertex , they all leave parts of the vertex undetermined .",
    "so the results might depend heavily on the particular choice for the vertex .",
    "another disadvantage of using a vertex ansatz is that it is not possible to improve the approximation in a systematic way .      in this paper",
    ", we use several different anstze for the full vertex , including a bare vertex , and compare the results to see how much influence these different choices have on the propagators . for the sake of simplicity , we consider the form @xmath32 with the restriction that for @xmath33 , the full vertex reduces to the bare vertex .",
    "this automatically ensures that in the weak coupling limit , the full vertex reduces to the bare one .",
    "such an ansatz has the same tensor structure as the bare vertex , and by restricting ourselves to this tensor structure , we simplify the numerical integrations considerably .",
    "it is also generally expected that this tensor structure plays the most dominant role in the full vertex .    to be more specific",
    ", we will analyze the coupled ds equations for the propagators , using the following choices for @xmath34 :    1 .",
    "the bare vertex : @xmath35 [ bare ] 2 .   a simple ansatz inspired by the ball  chiu vertex eq .  ( [ bachver ] )",
    "@xcite : @xmath36 [ simple ] 3 .",
    "@xmath37 [ apkq ] 4 .",
    "@xmath38 [ quad ] 5",
    ".   @xmath39 .",
    "[ prod ]    of these choices , only the first two are actually motivated on physical arguments .",
    "the last one is primarily motivated by the fact that the resulting truncated ds equations are easy to solve analytically ( at least in the symmetric phase ) .",
    "the choices [ apkq ] and [ quad ] are merely added in order to see how much the results depend on our particular choice ; ansatz [ apkq ] is based on [ prod ] , but linear in the wavefunction renormalization , as it is supposed to be , whereas ansatz [ quad ] is the quadratic form of ansatz [ simple ] .",
    "the last two anstze are also inspired by the suggestion in @xcite that the effective vertex correction in the fermion ds equation is quadratic in the wavefunction renormalization .",
    "finally , we have to choose a gauge , and since the landau gauge is the most convenient and commonly used gauge , we use it . using the ansatz for the vertex we have just described , the ds equations for the propagators reduce to @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "first , we consider the massless fermion phase , so @xmath42 , which is always a solution of eq .",
    "( [ dseqb ] ) .",
    "this reduces the problem to solving two coupled equations , one for the wavefunction renormalization @xmath43 , and one for the vacuum polarization @xmath44 .      with @xmath42 ,",

    "the vacuum polarization becomes @xmath46 whereas ansatz [ prod ] leads to @xmath47 in the massless phase , the equation for the wavefunction renormalization becomes @xmath48 for the anstze [ apkq ] and [ prod ] , this can now be reduced to @xmath49 where we use @xmath50 rather than @xmath15 to define the energy scale .",
    "this last equation can be solved exactly @xmath51 whereas eq .",
    "( [ apkqsymeq ] ) gives a nonlinear integral equation for @xmath43 @xmath52 and thus gives an implicit relation for the wavefunction renormalization .",
    "however , both anstze lead to the same explicit expression , if we make one further approximation , which is commonly used in this context . in the infrared region , @xmath53 ,",
    "the vacuum polarization dominates : the denominators , @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ apkqsymeq ] ) , and @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ prodsymeq ] ) , both behave like @xmath56 , whereas for large momenta , @xmath57 , the wavefunction renormalization is almost equal to one , and the contribution to these denominators coming from the vacuum polarization can be neglected .",
    "so in both cases the wavefunction renormalization behaves like @xmath58      we can also solve the integral equations for the wavefunction renormalization and the vacuum polarization numerically .",
    "starting with bare propagators to calculate the vacuum polarization , we solve eq .",
    "( [ dseqa ] ) with this vacuum polarization . using this solution for the wavefunction renormalization",

    "[ figsymanal ] , we have plotted the analytic solutions for the wavefunction renormalization as described in the previous section , together with our numerical result . we see that they agree very well with each other qualitatively , and that in the ultraviolet region the @xmath43 is almost equal to one , as expected , whereas in the infrared region , it deviates considerably from the perturbative value .",
    "in particular , it is important to notice that for @xmath59 , the wavefunction renormalization vanishes , as also can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ analres ] ) .",
    "for the other vertex anstze , we can not solve the integral equations analytically .",
    "numerically , we find a very similar behavior for the wavefunction renormalization for all five different anstze , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsymfive](a ) .",
    "the vacuum polarization also seems to be quite insensitive to the vertex ansatz , as can be seen from fig .",

    "consider the coupled equations for the fermion and photon propagators , and use the same approximation for the full vertex in both the fermion and the photon ds equation .",
    "however , the _ deviation _ of the vacuum polarization from the perturbative leading - order behavior @xmath60 does depend strongly on the ansatz , see fig .",
    "[ figsymfive](c ) .",

    "( [ dseqasym ] ) , @xmath62 , so we can approximate this denominator by @xmath25 .",
    "we can now observe that there is a cancellation in the infrared region between the different effects of the vertex ansatz : the function @xmath63 enters the integral equation both in the numerator , and , via the vacuum polarization , in the denominator .",
    "the remaining equation for the wavefunction renormalization resembles the eqs .",
    "( [ apkqsymeq ] ) and ( [ prodsymeq ] ) , which we have analyzed in the previous subsection .",

    "note that for such a cancellation , the vacuum polarization has to depend quite strongly on the precise ansatz , and in fig .",
    "[ figsymfive](c ) we see that the deviation from the perturbative behavior is indeed governed by the powers of @xmath43 in our vertex ansatz .",
    "using a bare vertex , the vacuum polarization becomes quadratic in @xmath64 , with a vertex linear in @xmath65 , the vacuum polarization becomes linear in @xmath64 and with an ansatz which is quadratic in the wavefunction renormalization , the vacuum polarization does not contain any powers of @xmath65 , and is ( almost ) equal to the perturbative one .    finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ figsym24610 ] the wavefunction renormalization for several different numbers of fermion flavors .",

    "( [ analres ] ) , the wavefunction renormalization vanishes in the infrared region , in contrast to what one might expect based on ordinary perturbation theory or the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "such a vanishing behavior could very well be related to an anomalous dimension for the wavefunction renormalization as suggested in @xcite .",

    "this shows that our numerical results are in good agreement with the expectation of an anomalous dimension for the wavefunction renormalization , at least in the infrared region . in the ultraviolet region , eq .",
    "( [ andim ] ) is not expected to be valid .",
    "one of the interesting features of qed3 is that a fermion mass can be generated dynamically , breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "starting with massless bare fermions , they can acquire a dynamical mass through nonperturbative effects .",
    "the order parameter for this symmetry breaking is the chiral condensate @xmath71 , but it is more convenient to consider the infrared value of @xmath72 as the order parameter .",
    "writing the full fermion propagator as @xmath73 a nonzero solution for @xmath72 implies a nonzero condensate , and signals dynamical mass generation .",
    "the infrared value of the dynamical mass function defined by @xmath74 , @xmath75 can also be used as order parameter .",
    "note we are not calculating the physical mass , defined at the pole of the propagator ; this physical mass is expected to be in the minkowski region , at least for observable particles , whereas we are performing our calculations completely in euclidean region .",
    "the question of the existence of such a physical mass in the time - like region is not addressed here @xcite .",
    "based on bifurcation theory , we can show that , for determining the critical number ( if there is a critical number ) of fermion flavors , it is sufficient to keep the terms which are linear in the generated mass , assuming that there is a continuous phase transition .",
    "this means that we can use the symmetric solutions for the vacuum polarization and wavefunction renormalization in the equation for @xmath76 . to avoid infrared problems ,",
    "we replace the denominator @xmath77 by @xmath78 , and thus the equation for @xmath76 reduces to @xmath79 or in terms of the mass function @xmath80 with @xmath65 and @xmath81 as found in the previous section .",
    "consider first the anstze [ apkq ] and [ prod ] .",
    "they lead to @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we note that these equations are qualitatively similar : in the infrared region , the part coming from the vacuum polarization , @xmath56 , will dominate over the other part , @xmath84 or @xmath85 respectively , whereas in the ultraviolet region @xmath86 .",
    "thus , both anstze lead to almost the same equation for the mass function .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ prodbroken ] ) is exactly the same equation for the mass function as one would get by using a bare vertex and neglecting the wavefunction renormalization completely @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the essential region for dynamical mass generation is the infrared region @xmath87 , we can use the scale @xmath88 as an ultraviolet cutoff .",

    "we can neglect @xmath85 with respect to the vacuum polarization in the denominator @xmath97 .",
    "counting the powers of @xmath65 , we see that this vacuum polarization is roughly proportional to @xmath98 , so the dependence of the integration kernel in eq .",
    "( [ dseqmbif ] ) on the wavefunction renormalization and the vertex ansatz might cancel out .",
    "this is similar to what we have already seen in the previous section , namely that the behavior of the wavefunction renormalization is almost independent of the vertex ansatz we use .",
    "therefore , although the behavior of the vacuum polarization might depend on the vertex ansatz , we expect that in fact the fermion propagator is not very sensitive to the precise ansatz , due to a cancellation in the ( far ) infrared region between the implicit dependence of @xmath25 on the function @xmath99 , and the explicit appearance of this function in the integration kernel of eq .",
    "( [ dseqmbif ] ) . on these grounds",
    "one might expect a critical number of fermion flavors , independent of our choice for the vertex .",
    "even if we relax our requirement that the ansatz goes to the bare vertex in the ultraviolet region , we find a similar result : consider for example the ( unphysical ) vertex @xmath100 this would lead to the equation for the mass function like @xmath101 which has an additional factor of two .",
    "however , in the infrared region , this factor of two cancels against the additional factor of two which comes from the vacuum polarization , leading to the same critical number as with ansatz [ prod ] .    note",
    "that it is crucial for such a cancellation to occur that we consider the vacuum polarization with full propagators ; using bare propagators in the loop for the vacuum polarization , is an inconsistent approximation .",
    "formally , using such bare fermions in the loop for the vacuum polarization is in agreement with the @xmath7 expansion , but as we have seen in the previous section , the wavefunction renormalization is not of the order @xmath102 in the infrared region .",
    "therefore we should use the full propagators when calculating the vacuum polarization .",
    "even when using bifurcation theory to calculate the critical number of fermion flavors , one should use the full propagators in the vacuum polarization , or to be more precise , the massless full propagators .",
    "we can solve the coupled equations numerically for the mass function @xmath103 ( or for @xmath76 ) , the wavefunction renormalization @xmath65 , and the vacuum polarization @xmath81 in the broken phase . starting with a trial function for @xmath76 and the leading order contribution for the wavefunction , @xmath104",

    "it agrees very well with earlier numerical studies of this approximation @xcite .    the typical behavior of the functions @xmath65 , @xmath76 , and @xmath81 is shown in fig .  [ figabpibroken ] for several values of @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the wavefunction renormalization decreases for small momenta , but does not vanish for @xmath59 : its value at the origin is nonzero , in contrast to the behavior in the symmetric phase .",
    "also the behavior of the vacuum polarization is different : in the broken phase , the vacuum polarization behaves like @xmath108 in the ( far ) infrared region , so @xmath109 is finite at @xmath59 , whereas in the symmetric phase , @xmath109 blows up at the origin .",
    "the infrared behavior of the vacuum polarization is governed by the generated mass function : the smaller this mass function , the larger @xmath109 .",
    "finally the mass function , or rather @xmath76 , is almost constant at small momenta , and decreases rapidly for large momenta .",
    "however , in the unquenched approximation , and especially close to the critical number of fermion flavors , we see _ two _ relevant mass scales @xcite : @xmath72 starts to decrease at the scale of the generated mass , but only beyond the energy scale @xmath88 , it decreases like @xmath106",

    "we have solved the _ coupled _ ds equations for the fermion propagator and the vacuum polarization , both in the chirally symmetric and in the broken phase , using a certain class of vertex functions . with this type of vertex , the behavior of the fermion propagator is almost independent of the exact form of the full vertex .",
    "we find a critical number for chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath112 , below which there is dynamical mass generation ; above this critical number , only the chirally symmetric solution exists .    in the chirally symmetric phase ,",
    "the wavefunction renormalization is approximately equal to one in the ultraviolet region , but in the infrared region , @xmath43 vanishes , indicating an anomalous dimension . this non - uniform behavior of the wavefunction renormalization lies at the origin of a controversy about the existence of a critical number of fermion flavors .",
    "also in the broken phase , @xmath43 is not of the order one , as one might expect naively , but considerably smaller : as the number of fermion flavors approaches the critical number , @xmath113 tends to go to zero .",
    "these results will also be relevant for studies of this model at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "our main result , a finite critical number of fermion flavors for dynamical mass generation , confirms the assertions obtained earlier by appelquist _",
    "their analysis was based upon a bare vertex and neglect of the wavefunction renormalization .",
    "there have been several claims that including the effects of the wavefunction renormalization leads to a different result , namely dynamical mass generation for all numbers of fermion flavors @xcite .",
    "these and other studies , such as @xcite , show a crucial dependence on the behavior of the full vertex ; in general a bare vertex or a vertex linear in the wavefunction renormalization would lead to chiral symmetry breaking for all @xmath3 , whereas a vertex quadratic in @xmath65 leads to a critical number of fermion flavors .",
    "however , all these studies include the wavefunction renormalization and an ansatz for the full vertex in the fermion ds equation , but not in the vacuum polarization .",
    "we would like to stress that in order to solve the ds equation for the fermion propagator self - consistently , we have to treat the fermion propagator nonperturbatively _ both _ in the fermion ds equation _ and _ in the equation for the vacuum polarization , at least if we are using the unquenched approximation .",
    "also , one must use the same approximation for the full vertex in both the fermion and photon ds equation .",
    "it turns out that the effects of the wavefunction renormalization through the vacuum polarization change drastically the naive results obtained in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these earlier results , our results are almost independent of the vertex ansatz .    for studying the chiral phase transition",
    ", one can use bifurcation theory and therefore neglect the dynamical mass function in the wavefunction renormalization .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that bifurcation theory does not imply that one can use bare propagators in the vacuum polarization : one should use the chirally - symmetric full propagators .",
    "of course , if the wavefunction renormalization is equal to one ( as one often assumes in this kind of calculations ) , one can use the bare propagators to calculate the vacuum polarization .",
    "we have made only one approximation in our calculation : replacing the full vertex by our ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ genansatz ] ) . of course",
    ", one could question this approximation , but our result is almost independent of the precise form of the function @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that a next - to - leading order calculation in the context of the @xmath7 expansion also leads to a finite critical number of fermion flavors @xcite .",
    "our result is also in good agreement with lattice calculations @xcite .",
