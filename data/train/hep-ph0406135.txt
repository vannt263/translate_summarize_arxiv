    "the high - energy behaviour of qcd amplitudes is described by the bfkl / ccfm equation  @xcite which sums to all orders leading logarithmic contributions of the form @xmath8 .",
    "the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) corrections @xmath9 have been calculated in refs .",
    "the nll corrections turn out to have a large numerical effect , and therefore in order to obtain reliable predictions one needs to first understand the origin of the large numerical coefficients at nll and then if possible to further resum the main part of the nll contribution .    in the past few years",
    "there have been a number of studies of the bfkl approach at nll accuracy , see refs .",
    "@xcite , which concentrate on the properties and the behaviour of the gluon green function . in this paper",
    "we focus instead on the gluon transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution along the bfkl evolution chain and compare the predictions obtained using both the resummed nll bfkl and the lo dglap evolution approaches .",
    "besides the pure theoretical interest in further understanding the properties of qcd in the high - energy limit , there are also important phenomenological implications .",
    "precise knowledge of the @xmath0 distribution of intermediate ( i.e. accompanying ) gluons is important for achieving a better understanding of the structure of the so - called ` underlying event ' at hadron colliders such as the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "as has been emphasized in @xcite , the fact that the transverse momentum of the emitted partons ( and therefore of the soft hadrons and minijets ) grows with energy ( i.e. with @xmath2 ) could cause problems due to a ` noisy ' underlying event affecting the extraction of a clean new - physics signal ( for example , inclusive production of higgs bosons , susy particles , etc . ) at the lhc .",
    "therefore it is very important to be able calculate the predicted gluon @xmath0 distribution as precisely as possible .",
    "of course the standard approach is to use parton shower monte carlos such as herwig and pythia to estimate the @xmath0 distribution of accompanying partons / hadrons .",
    "however as these models are based on dglap evolution , they do _ not _ contain all the expected logarithmic contributions in the high - energy limit .",
    "it is therefore important to understand how and why the dglap and ( potentially more realistic ) resummed nll bfkl approaches differ",
    ". such a comparison will form a major part of our study . also very relevant , is the high - energy behaviour of the saturation momentum @xmath10  the transverse momentum at which non - linear effects ( from gluon - gluon rescattering and recombination ) become important and start to saturate the parton densities .",
    "the bfkl amplitude is usually described in terms of the pomeron intercept ( i.e. the singularity in the complex momentum @xmath11plane ) @xmath12 which depends on the anomalous dimension ( @xmath13 ) of the eigenfunction .",
    "in contrast , dglap evolution is usually described in terms of @xmath14 , i.e. the anomalous dimension is considered as a function of @xmath15 , the conjugate variable to @xmath16 .    in order to compare the dglap and bfkl predictions , in section  2",
    "we will consider the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath17  that is , the probability to find a gluon carrying longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 and transverse momentum @xmath0 in a process with ( hard ) factorization scale @xmath18  written in the form of a double contour integral over both @xmath13 and @xmath15 , i.e. performing simultaneous mellin transforms with respect to both the @xmath0 and @xmath16 distributions . depending on which of these integrations is performed first , one obtains either the standard dglap or the bfkl form .    in section",
    "3 we introduce a resummation which is a modification of that proposed by the firenze group  @xcite . the idea is to modify the contibution of the poles at @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) corresponding to the normal ( inverse ) @xmath0ordered dglap evolution . to be explicit",
    ", we include the full lo dglap ( splitting function ) contribution , allow for the appropriate ` energy ' variable @xmath21 , and account for energy - momentum conservation .",
    "after these modifications have been made , it has been shown that the remaining part of the nll correction does not exceed 7% of the original value .    solving the bfkl equation for the intercept @xmath22 with respect to @xmath13 , one obtains the nlo contribution @xmath23 to the dglap anomalous dimension @xmath14 , equivalently the @xmath24 contribution to the ( gluon - gluon ) splitting function .",
    "it turns out that in leading - order ( lo ) bfkl the first two non - trivial terms vanish ) below can be written in the form @xmath25 .",
    "] , i.e. @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "therefore the expected bfkl corrections to dglap evolution are numerically rather weak ( see @xcite for a more detail discussion ) .",
    "on the other hand , in terms of the intercept @xmath11 the value of @xmath27 given by the lo bfkl equation is much larger than that coming from dglap . at first sight",
    "this looks like a contradiction .",
    "however the situation changes dramatically after the nll resummation .",
    "now the bfkl intercept becomes close to , and even slightly smaller than , the corresponding dglap quantity .",
    "thus in any kinematic configuration where the initial and final virtualities ( transverse momenta ) are not too close to each other , the dglap and the bfkl predictions do not differ significantly ( in agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 distribution on the overall event kinematics is discussed in section  4 and the @xmath16-dependence of the saturation momentum @xmath1 is discussed in section  5 .",
    "section  6 contains our conclusions .",
    "we begin by considering the unintegrated ( over transverse momentum ) gluon distribution @xmath17 , in the form @xcite @xmath28 where the survival probability @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 here the infrared cutoff is @xmath31 ; @xmath18 is the factorisation scale ; and @xmath32 is the number of active quark flavours . when @xmath0 is close to @xmath18 we may neglect the double logarithms in the @xmath29-factor , since @xmath33 , and thus @xmath34 .",
    "then the unintegrated distribution is simply related to the derivative of the standard ( integrated ) gluon parton distribution function : @xmath35_{\\mu = k_t}. \\label{eq : derivative}\\ ] ] introducing the mellin - transform variables , @xmath13 and @xmath15 , conjugate to @xmath36 and @xmath2 respectively , we can write @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 represents the input distribution at @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the starting scale for perturbative evolution assumed to be @xmath45  gev .",
    "@xmath46 is the resummed bfkl intercept , @xmath47 , where the leading order ( ll ) contribution is @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the nll correction .",
    "the contour integration over @xmath15 goes to the right of all singularities , while the real part of the anomalous dimension @xmath13 is bounded by @xmath50 .    in the dglap limit @xmath51 we close the @xmath13 contour around the pole given by @xmath52 , leaving the inverse mellin integral over @xmath15 with @xmath53 . in the bfkl case ( @xmath54 ) we close the @xmath15 contour around the same pole @xmath52 and write the result as an integral over @xmath13 , with @xmath55 . in the latter form @xmath56 with @xmath57 given by the solution of the equation @xmath58 and @xmath59 with this representation ,",
    "the input distribution at @xmath44 is absorbed into @xmath60 , which may therefore be fitted to reproduce the data .",
    "another possibility is to use the conventional mellin ( @xmath15 ) representation for @xmath37 by closing the @xmath13 contour around the nearest pole . strictly speaking the bfkl function @xmath61 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0 ] ) has poles at each integer @xmath13 .",
    "the pole at @xmath19 corresponds to the normal twist-2 dglap contribution , the pole at @xmath20 corresponds to inverse @xmath0 ordering ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the other poles at @xmath63 are the higher - twist contributions ( 3 , 4 , ... gluons in the @xmath64-channel ) , corresponding to normal ( inverse ) @xmath0 ordering , hidden in the reggeization of the bfkl gluons .",
    "however in practice we know that the higher - twist contribution at small @xmath16 is small ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , to begin , we may neglect the poles at negative @xmath13 , arguing that phenomenologically the input function @xmath42 is numerically small at negative integer values of @xmath13 .",
    "integral ( [ eq : dgamma ] ) we can not rule out the possibility of other singularities in the @xmath15 plane situated to the left of the leading pole at @xmath65 .",
    "however , since in any case we can not justify the bfkl approach for large @xmath66 , in the present context we only keep the leading pole in ( [ eq : dgamma ] ) . ]",
    "we then obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the known mellin transform ( @xmath16-moments ) of the input gluon distribution . the first factor @xmath13 in ( [ eq : domega ] ) is due to the derivative in ( [ eq : derivative ] ) , and all @xmath13 dependent quantities are evaluated at @xmath70 , the solution of ( [ eq : solution ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider the resummed nll contribution to the unintegrated gluon distribution defined in the previous section .",
    "we use the idea proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a small modification , which is rather simple and more convenient for our purpose .",
    "the crucial point is the fact that the major part of the o(@xmath71 ) correction is actually contained in the o(@xmath15 ) contribution . ] .",
    "next we note that the nearest , and most important , poles in the quantity @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0 ] ) at @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond , respectively , to the well known , normal- ( @xmath72 ) and inverted- ( @xmath62 ) ordered , twist-2 dglap contributions .",
    "thus the leading - order characteristic function @xmath61 contains two parts .",
    "one is the twist-2 poles @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and the remainder is the higher - twist component , @xmath75 .",
    "that is @xmath76 where , from ( [ eq : x0 ] ) , we have @xmath77    first , we have to modify the poles to include in the residues the _ full _ lo dglap splitting function . because in the physical ( axial ) gauge both the bfkl and dglap lo contributions are given by ladder - type feynman diagrams , the mellin transform of the final ( modified ) amplitude in the @xmath15 , @xmath13 representation may be written in the same exponential form as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : doubleint],[eq : dgamma],[eq : domega ] ) .",
    "thus the residue 1 in the twist-2 dglap pole at @xmath19 is replaced by the full dglap splitting function @xmath78 in pure gluodynamics ( i.e. @xmath79 ) @xmath80 . to account for the quark loop contribution for @xmath81 we have to replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 where the first term in the brackets corresponds to the real quark two - loop contribution integral over the second loop , in the dglap approximation ,",

    "the same procedure can be followed to modify the residue of the @xmath74 pole , which corresponds to the dglap evolution with inverse @xmath0 ordering .",
    "another modification is necessary . in order to compare the bfkl and dglap predictions we have to write everything in terms of the dglap ` energy ' variable @xmath21 . due to the asymmetry in the definition of the energy scales , for the normal and inverse ordered contributions , we need to correct the contribution of the @xmath74 pole , and to replace @xmath85 by @xmath86 ( see section  3.3 and eq .",

    "the nll contribution @xmath88 consists of a twist-2 part , which is shown in brackets , and a correction , @xmath89 , to the higher - twist component ( [ eq : ht ] ) of @xmath61 , whose origin we now explain .",

    "in fact for @xmath110 the nll bfkl value is even a little below the dglap intercept .",
    "however for large values of @xmath111 , the nll bfkl curves go above the dglap curves , due an additional positive term from the pole @xmath112 which arises from the inverse @xmath0-ordered contribution .",
    "the approximate equality of the nll bfkl and dglap curves for @xmath109 occurs because this positive contribution is compensated by the virtual corrections corresponding to gluon reggeization , that is by the higher - twist poles at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which give a negative contribution .",
    "as we go into the complex @xmath13 plane , the resummed intercept decreases faster than that of dglap , and is closer to the original lo bfkl , since we become further away from the twist-2 dglap pole at @xmath19 .",
    "this decrease of the nll intercept improves the convergency of the saddle - point integral . to demonstrate this behaviour of @xmath107 in the complex @xmath13 plane , we plot in figs .",

    "the value of the intercept decreases with increasing i m @xmath13 and , due to the higher twist contributions , we indeed see that in the bfkl case it decreases faster than in the dglap case .",
    "finally , we can investigate the role of the quark loop corrections . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1 ] we have considered the ( realistic ) case of four light quarks ( @xmath116 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w2 ] we show the analogous results for pure gluodynamics ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the inclusion of quark loop contributions evidently shifts the position of the singularity at @xmath107 to the left ; the absolute value of the ( negative ) virtual quark loop correction is larger than the real quark loop contribution .",
    "this demonstrates that the gluon spends part of the ` evolution time ' ( i.e. rapidity interval ) in the form of a quark - antiquark state which corresponds to a lower intercept @xmath117 , that is to a negative value of @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we use the formalism developed above to study numerically the gluon @xmath0 distribution , and in particular how it changes as one moves along the evolution chain starting from a given input distribution at a particular value of @xmath16 .",
    "we begin by introducing the green function ( @xmath118 ) corresponding to the unintegrated gluon distribution with the initial condition @xmath119 at @xmath120 , i.e. a fixed non - zero value of @xmath0 at @xmath120 . according to the results of the previous section",
    ", we have @xmath121 here @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the solution of ( [ eq : solution ] ) .    to evaluate the spread in the transverse momentum @xmath125 at some intermediate value of @xmath126 ( that is @xmath127 ) , we write the final unintegrated distribution @xmath128 as the convolution @xmath129 and study the distribution of the integrand over @xmath125 .",
    "it is simplest to elucidate the procedure pictorially .",
    "the complete evolution is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : cigar ] .",
    "we have the source at @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and consider the evolution to the final gluon at @xmath132 and some large value of @xmath0 , say 30 gev .",
    "this point can be reached by different evolution trajectories , indicated by the shaded area in the diagram .",
    "of course the exact form of the shaded region will depend on the approximation used to calculate the behaviour of the gluon along the evolution chain .",
    "for example , we shall see that , as expected , lo bfkl with running coupling @xmath71 , tends to populate the low @xmath0 domain much more than the other three approximations that we use .",
    "=    we are now in a position to study the correlated quantity of experimental interest , that is the distribution of intermediate gluons in a process where a high @xmath133 ( or high mass ) particle is produced , with ( light - cone ) momentum fraction @xmath134 . the scale of the process specifies the final @xmath0 of our gluon evolution .",
    "we have therefore written , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convolg ] ) , the final gluon distribution as a convolution in @xmath125 of the gluon density at @xmath135 and the green function ( [ eq : green ] ) which describes the evolution from @xmath135 to the final point @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity of experimental interest is thus the integrand , @xmath136 , which represents the @xmath125 distribution at an intermediate value of @xmath135 . in particular",
    "we wish to investigate how the intermediate @xmath125 distributions , obtained in the various approaches , differ from one another ; or , to be more explicit , to see if the nll bfkl result brings the lo bfkl behaviour close to the dglap result .",
    "it is convenient to plot the results as the ratio of the integrand to the final gluon density , @xmath137 .",
    "this corresponds to the ` normalized ' distribution @xmath138 of the intermediate gluons as a function of @xmath139 , at the chosen intermediate value @xmath140 .    for the purpose of illustration",
    "we calculate the evolution of the gluon @xmath0 distribution taking the initial scale to be @xmath141  gev and choosing the final @xmath142  gev at @xmath143 . for the lhc energy ( @xmath144  tev )",

    "the shape of the distribution depends on the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "starting with @xmath149 at @xmath130 ( that is from the conditions corresponding to the bfkl green function ) we obtain almost flat distributions ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : running]d ) .",
    "however , for valence - like input , it is a bit narrower ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : running]c ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the cigar - like shape of fig .",
    "[ fig : cigar ] is broader for bfkl , so we would anticipate a broader @xmath125 distribution .",
    "however at fixed @xmath175 , for low @xmath0 we enter the low @xmath135 region where the valence - like input vanishes .",
    "this has a larger effect on the more spreadout bfkl distribution than on that of dglap , with its thinner cigar which practically does not sample the region with @xmath180 .",
    "evidently , however , the effect is not very strong and the final nll bfkl and lo dglap distributions do not differ significantly .",
    "this result is of great phenomenological importance , since it implies that for the kinematic regions described above , which are typical of what may be studied at the lhc , parton shower monte carlos based on lo dglap evolution should give a reasonable approximation to the predictions obtained using a full nll resummed bfkl calculation .",
    "recall that the @xmath125 distributions have been shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fixed ] and [ fig : running ] in ` normalized ' form , @xmath181 that is we have shown the density of intermediate gluons with momentum fraction @xmath140 in events where the final gluon has been detected with momentum @xmath0 and fraction @xmath16 . therefore we have introduced the factor @xmath128 in the denominator . to obtain more insight , we show , in fig .  [",
    "fig : actual ] , the actual @xmath125 distributions @xmath182 obtained in the four approximations , corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : running]b .",
    "this quantity , ( [ eq : f ] ) , represents the double inclusive cross section  the probability to observe both the final gluon @xmath183 and the intermediate gluon @xmath184 .",
    "note that up to now we have been dealing with single ladder graphs and therefore have not taken any account of absorptive corrections ( or gluon recombination ) .",
    "these effects are formally suppressed by a factor @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is some dimensionful parameter coming from the confinement domain .",
    "however it is well known that at very small @xmath16 the parton densities grow and the non - linear two- or multi - ladder contributions must eventually become important .",
    "this occurs when the cross section for gluon - gluon recombination becomes comparable with the proton area @xmath187 , i.e. @xmath188 .",
    "now at high energies the cross section behaves as @xmath189 .",
    "therefore to have @xmath188 requires @xmath190 this raises the question as to what value of @xmath13 ( and correspondingly @xmath27 ) should one use in ( [ eq : s1 ] ) ?",
    "it can be shown that multi - ladder ( fan ) graphs becomes important for @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is given by the equation @xmath193 this equation was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the ` wave front ' method in the framework of the glr equation",
    ". then it was considered in ref .",
    "the equation can also be justified on the basis of the balitsky - kovchegov equation ( in conformal symmetric form ) @xcite . in the appendix",
    "we show how ( [ eq : sat ] ) can be derived using bfkl eigenfunctions .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) for @xmath192 , we return to the @xmath13-integral representation of the amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dgamma ] ) . by evaluating the integral using the saddle point method",
    ", we see that for large @xmath194 ( i.e. a large interval of @xmath195 dglap evolution ) the value of the saddle point , @xmath196 , is small , but increases with the rapidity interval @xmath197 . when the position of the saddle point is such that @xmath198 , the non - linear contributions are negligible .",
    "however if @xmath199 , then the absorptive effects become large and we rapidly reach the saturation regime with @xmath200 .",
    "the value of @xmath201 was obtained in @xcite using the lo bfkl formalism .",
    "evaluating @xmath192 using the resummed nll bfkl expressions for @xmath107 given in section  2 , we arrive at almost the same value  @xmath202 for @xmath203  and , in fact , in the limit @xmath204 the critical anomalous dimension @xmath205 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the @xmath16 dependence of the saturation momentum @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that we already reach the value of @xmath206  gev at some @xmath207 . with decreasing @xmath16 we need to increase @xmath10 in order to keep the saddle point at @xmath208 .",
    "the equation which gives the saddle point of the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dgamma ] ) is @xmath209 where we have used ( [ eq : sat ] ) to get the last equality .",
    "we can not determine the saddle point directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : speq ] ) , since the value of @xmath107 depends on the running of @xmath71 . therefore we need to obtain a differential equation .",
    "this leads to @xmath210 solving this equation for @xmath192 leads to the @xmath16 dependence of the saturation momentum @xmath10 that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] . here",
    "we include the light quark contribution with @xmath116 .",
    "the labelling of the various curves is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1 ] .",
    "we see that after the resummation of the nll bfkl corrections the value of @xmath10 grows much more slowly than in the lo bfkl case .",
    "moreover , the nll bfkl curve even drops below the dglap curve , since in the region of @xmath211 the value of @xmath212 see fig .",
    "[ fig : w1 ] . for a low value of @xmath71",
    ", we find the expected ordering @xmath213 in fig .  [ fig : sat]b . however at larger values of @xmath71 ,",
    "we see @xmath214 becomes less than @xmath215 , as shown in fig  [ fig : sat]c , d . due to the fact that the resummed value of @xmath107 depends only weakly on @xmath71",
    ", @xmath216 increases almost linearly with @xmath217 , with @xmath218 the power of @xmath16 that we have obtained using nll resummation is somewhat larger than the result of @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , at very large @xmath10 ( and @xmath219 ) , the lo bfkl ( dotted ) and the resummed nll bfkl ( solid ) curves become parallel .    =    to determine the saturation momentum , @xmath10 , from fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] , we need to know the value of @xmath207 where , by definition , @xmath206 gev . if we were to take the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , then @xmath207 would be in the range @xmath220 , see fig .  8 of @xcite .",
    "if we assume that @xmath221 , then we see that the expected saturation region accessible to the experiments at hera ( @xmath222 ) lies outside the pure perturbative domain where one can safely neglect higher - twist effects , power corrections , etc .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution of gluons emitted along the gluon chains that accompany a hard subprocess at high energy hadron colliders could give rise to two types of problem .",
    "first on the theoretical side , we have the possibility of infrared instability at low @xmath0 . due to the presence of inverse @xmath0-ordering ,",
    "lo bfkl evolution tends to populate the low @xmath0 domain where the qcd coupling @xmath71 is larger .",
    "the other potential problem is more experimental .",
    "the @xmath0 diffusion , caused by the presence of inverse @xmath0-ordering , may produce too many large @xmath0 gluons accompanying the hard subprocess , and , as a consequence , obscure the extraction of new physics .    to study these issues ,",
    "we have used the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite for nll bfkl resummation to calculate the resummed bfkl intercept and the @xmath0 distribution of the intermediate gluons emitted during the evolution in both the bfkl and dglap cases .",
    "we have shown that after such resummation the bfkl intercept becomes much smaller than that obtained using the lo bfkl formalism , and rather close to that obtained using dglap evolution .",
    "indeed , the nll resummation tames both the potential problems .",
    "the infrared convergency of the distributions is similar to that for dglap .",
    "secondly , for high @xmath0 , the nll bfkl gluon distribution only slightly exceeds the dglap prediction .",
    "thus , contrary to what might be expected from lo bfkl studies , we do not expect any significant increase in accompanying gluon ( and therefore minijet and hadron ) transverse momentum over and above that which is obtained using the parton shower monte carlo approach .",
    "it turns out that the presence of the terms with inverse ordering in @xmath0 are approximately compensated by high - twist gluon reggeization .",
    "moreover , it follows that the saturation momentum calculated using the resummed nll bfkl framework is much lower than that predicted by lo bfkl .",
    "this implies that we can not trust the numerical results obtained in the framework of the balitsky - kovchegov equation , which is based on lo bfkl .",
    "therefore the growth of the saturation scale @xmath10 should in practice be much slower than that predicted , for example , in refs .",
    "indeed from the nll bfkl curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] we conclude that saturation effects are not expected in the pure perturbation region accessible to the experiments at hera . even at the lhc",
    ", it will not be easy to observe saturation in the perturbative region .",
    "note that , from ( [ eq : sx ] ) , we have @xmath223 solving this equation at the lhc energy , @xmath224 tev , we obtain in the centre of the pseudorapidity plateau @xmath225 assuming that @xmath226 .",
    "thus , at the lhc , the only chance to observe saturation phenomena , with the scale not too low , @xmath227 say , is to study processes in the fragmentation region , with @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution of intermediate gluons emitted along the evolution chain depends strongly on the form of the input conditions . for a realistic ` pomeron - like ' input the distributions predicted by the resummed nll bfkl and dglap evolutions are rather close to each other .",
    "however , because of the contribution of configurations with inverse @xmath0 ordering the nll bfkl distribution is slightly wider ( i.e. has a larger dispersion ) .",

    "the non - linear bfkl evolution equation is ( that is , we consider the forward amplitude with a flat azimuthal dependence ) . recall that the eigenfunctions which have @xmath230 correspond to @xmath231  @xcite and therefore the non - linear contribution with @xmath230 will in any case be small , being suppressed by at least a factor @xmath71 , in comparison with the linear one . ] @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the bfkl kernel and @xmath234 is the triple pomeron vertex .",
    "if we expand the amplitude in terms of the conformal eigenfunctions @xmath235 ( for the case of our forward amplitude with @xmath236 ) , @xmath237 then we obtain the following equation for @xmath238 @xmath239 where @xmath240 , and where the triple pomeron vertex in the @xmath13 representation is denoted by @xmath241 .",
    "in addition to the extra @xmath71 ( in comparison with @xmath107 ) , the vertex @xmath234 contains the factor @xmath242 , which represents the small probability of recombination of two gluons of size @xmath243 homogeneously distributed over a domain of transverse size @xmath244 . when going from eq .",

    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) , we have integrated the product of the vertex @xmath234 and the two eigenfunctions @xmath245 and @xmath246 ( hidden in @xmath37 ) over the transverse momentum @xmath125 .",
    "the integral over @xmath247 gives a pole @xmath248 which reflects the conservation law for the anomalous dimensions .",
    "one of the integrals , say @xmath249 , may be done by closing the contour on this pole , while the other ( @xmath250 ) can be performed by the saddle point method .",
