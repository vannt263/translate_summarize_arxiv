    "spiral galaxies require a continuous supply of gas to maintain star formation over long timescales and to explain their metallicity distribution and evolution ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "what form this gas supply takes has not been observationally established , but it may be that the dominant form of supply is cold gas accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the milky way ( mw ) and the nearest galaxies high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are observed @xcite , some with low metallicity @xcite . the hvcs may contribute a small fraction of the fuel needed for star formation , but a more complete census is required to be able to draw general conclusions . while distinct hi  clouds of this nature are not commonly detected in the outskirts of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , another morphological feature  thick gas disks  is becoming increasingly recognized as a typical structural feature of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these gas disks can contribute up to @xmath1 of the total hi  mass of their host galaxies , and have distinct kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these slowly rotating thick disks may be connected to the accretion history @xcite and provide an observational tracer of coronal material feeding the disk .",
    "searching for clouds and for thick hi  disks requires specialized deep observations .",
    "the halogas ( hydrogen accretion in local galaxies ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey was undertaken to provide the required capability for a large enough sample to begin to draw statistical conclusions .",
    "the core of the survey are westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observations of 22 edge - on and moderately - inclined nearby galaxies , each observed for 120 hours in the 21-cm hi  line .",
    "the typical @xmath2 column density sensitivity is @xmath3 for typical linewidth of @xmath4 , making halogas the deepest interferometric galaxy hi  survey available to date .",
    "halogas has an optimal angular resolution of @xmath5 ( 1.5 kpc at a typical distance of 10 mpc ) , unsuitable for detailed high - resolution studies of the gas - star formation connection like things ( the hi  nearby galaxy survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but ideal for faint diffuse emission .",
    "the typical halogas mass sensitivity for unresolved clouds with the same linewidth allows the detection of hvc analogues in the outskirts of the survey galaxies , @xmath6    the primary halogas observations were completed as of early 2013 .",
    "a number of ancillary data products have been collected to supplement our deep hi  observations .",
    "deep multi - band optical imagery have been obtained at the _ isaac newton telescope _ ( int ) and kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) ; see e.g. @xcite . sensitive _ galex _",
    "uv data have also been collected to supplement deep survey data already available for some halogas targets . together with the hi  line observations , broadband full - polarization continuum data are also available for many of the survey galaxies , allowing the detailed investigation of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in the same galaxies .",
    "the interferometric halogas data are being supplemented with single dish data from effelsberg and the the green bank telescope ( gbt )  useful not only to provide a missing short - spacing correction , but to enhance the search for clouds and streams in the outer parts of halogas galaxies .",
    "sophisticated data analysis techniques are required in order to achieve reliable structural parameters from the sensitive hi  data cubes provided by halogas .",
    "isolating thick hi  disks in particular requires detailed modeling of the 3d gas distribution and kinematics .",
    "this modeling work is mostly performed using the tirific ( tilted ring fitting code ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) software .    two examples that illustrate the need for",
    "detailed tilted ring modeling are shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . in the case of ugc  7774 , the strong warping already apparent in the plane of the sky ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also causes the vertical thickening . in the other galaxy ,",
    "ngc  1003 , the disk structure recovered from a detailed 3d analysis shows a substantial warp ( @xmath7 ) along the line of sight , causing the disk to appear thicker in projection than the actual vertical distribution of the hi  layer .",
    "another interesting example , ngc  5023 ( not shown ) , illustrates an extreme case : recovery of spiral structure in an edge - on disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the modeling works best when these spiral structures are present and are required to fully understand the kinematics , emphasizing that this level of detail is essential to properly describe the 3d structure of the hi  in galaxies .",
    "halogas galaxies are both found to host thick hi  disks @xcite and to have little extraplanar hi  @xcite .",
    "this dichotomy provides powerful leverage on the origin of hi  thick disks in galaxies .",

    "we use both the 3d modeling mentioned in ",
    "[ section : overview ] , as well as an approximate disk - halo separation of the type presented by @xcite . on this basis",
    "we have searched for evidence of a common origin of the extraplanar hi  by comparing with the general properties of the sample galaxies . from the halogas sample",
    "we find a tentative connection between the star formation rate density and the presence of thick hi  disks , such that thick hi  disks appear to be present in galaxies above a threshold sf energy injection .",
    "we note that a similar relationship has been identified for radio continuum halos @xcite . in the case of the hi ,",
    "there appears to be a strong dependence on the star formation rate density , but a weaker dependence on the stellar mass density that traces the strength of the gravitational potential .",
    "another key result of the halogas survey is the identification of hi  clouds and streams in the vicinity of the sample galaxies that could originate through the cold gas accretion process , and to determine the impact on the star formation history of the sample .",
    "as previously noted , the occurrence of gas clouds in the outskirts of galaxies is low .",
    "the halogas survey , despite its high sensitivity , does not substantially change this picture .",
    "the halogas catalog of isolated gas features is still in preparation ( as we work toward a statistically sound census across the full sample ) , but we can already state qualitatively that there is a low incidence of clouds and streams .",
    "the contribution of visible hi  accretion to the star formation fueling process in nearby galaxies appears to be minimal .    as a representative example",
    ", we highlight ngc  1003 as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a small number of morphologically and kinematically distinct gas features have been identified from an inspection of the 3d hi  dataset ; these are shown with black contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "these features do not appear to have stellar counterparts , even in our deep optical images .",
    "the hi  masses and distances from ngc  1003 of these clouds are similar to the properties of the hvcs around the mw .",
    "the mass of these hvc analogues adds up to only @xmath13 , which over a dynamical time ( @xmath14 ) contributes only 2% of the star formation rate of ngc  1003 ( @xmath15 ; * ? ? ? * ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the gas contained in these clouds were used to completely fuel the current sfr , they would need to be replenished after only @xmath16 .",
    "these rates neglect a possible contribution from an ionized gas component to which we do not have observational constraints .",
    "we note however that the contribution of ionized gas to the total mass of mw hvcs can be substantial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; qso absorption line studies of low column density hi  probed by halogas where possible would be very useful to constrain this aspect of the mass budget .",
    "the scientific themes addressed by the halogas project will help to focus the groundbreaking science questions to be addressed with the square kilometre array ( ska ) and its pathfinder and precursor projects . for descriptions of surveys targeting deeper observations of larger nearby galaxy samples , as well as investigations of low column density igm material ,",
