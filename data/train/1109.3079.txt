    "the nuclear symmetry energy is a quantity of crucial importance in different areas of nuclear physics , including structure of ground - state nuclei @xcite , dynamics of heavy - ion reactions @xcite , physics of giant collective excitations @xcite and physics of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in the symmetry energy has been stirred up by novel astrophysical observations and by the availability of exotic beams in accelerators that provide additional information to the standard nuclear asymmetry studies based on stable nuclei .",
    "particularly important in the different areas , and similarly uncertain , is the density dependence of the symmetry energy in uniform matter . as can be seen e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , an increasing wide range of theoretical conclusions are being proposed on that density dependence , as well as on some associated nuclear characteristics . in the last years ,",
    "the temperature dependence of single - particle properties in nuclear and neutron matter was also broadly investigated ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    measurements of nuclear masses , densities , and collective excitations have allowed to resolve some of the basic features of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "however , the asymmetry properties of the eos due to different neutron and proton numbers remain more elusive to date , and the study of the isospin dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy remains a prime objective .",
    "the new radioactive ion beam facilities at csr ( china ) , fair ( germany ) , riken ( japan ) , spiral2/ganil ( france ) and the upcoming frib ( usa ) will provide the possibility of exploring the properties of nuclear matter and nuclei under the extreme condition of large isospin asymmetry .    experimentally , the symmetry energy is not a directly measurable quantity and has to be extracted indirectly from observables that are related to it ( see , for example , the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the neutron skin thickness of nuclei is a sensitive probe of the nuclear symmetry energy , although its precise measurement is difficult to obtain . at present neutron skin thicknesses",
    "are derived from pygmy dipole resonances measurements @xcite , data from antiprotonic atoms @xcite and other methods for its extraction like reactions and giant resonances .",
    "this allows one to constrain the parameters describing the nuclear symmetry energy .    considering nuclei from the isotopic chains of sn and pb , warda _ et al . _",

    "also , danielewicz @xcite has demonstrated that the ratio of the volume symmetry energy to the surface symmetry energy is closely related to the neutron skin thickness . the correlation between bulk and surface symmetry energy",
    "was further discussed in refs .",
    "recent calculations of thermal nuclear properties showed that the surface symmetry energy term is more sensitive to temperature than the volume energy term @xcite .",
    "the neutron skin thickness , generally defined as the difference between neutron and proton rms radii in the atomic nucleus , is closely correlated with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and with the equation of state of pure neutron matter .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei , like @xmath0pb , calculated in mean - field models with either nonrelativistic or relativistic effective nuclear interactions , displays a linear correlation with the slope of the neutron eos obtained with the same interactions at a neutron density @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite . the statistical analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite clearly shows the strong correlation that exists between the neutron form factor of @xmath0pb and isovector indicators such as neutron skins and radii in neutron - rich nuclei , dipole polarizability , and nuclear matter properties ( symmetry energy and pressure ) .",
    "the symmetry energy of finite nuclei at saturation density is often extracted by fitting ground state masses with various versions of the liquid - drop mass ( ldm ) formula within liquid - drop models @xcite .",
    "it has been also studied in the random phase approximation based on the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach @xcite or effective relativistic lagrangians with density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions @xcite , energy density functionals of skyrme force @xcite as well as relativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite . in the present work",
    "the symmetry energy will be studied _ in a wide range of finite nuclei _ on the basis of the brueckner energy - density functional for nuclear matter @xcite and using the coherent density fluctuation model ( cdfm ) ( e.g. , refs .",
    "the latter is a natural extension of the fermi gas model based on the generator coordinate method @xcite and includes long - range correlations of collective type .",
    "the cdfm has been applied to calculate the energies , the density distributions and rms radii of the ground and first monopole states in @xmath3he , @xmath4o and @xmath5ca nuclei @xcite .",
    "an analysis of breathing monopole states whose description is related mainly to general characteristics of atomic nuclei and weakly to the peculiarities of nuclear structure in the framework of the cdfm has been performed and also results for the incompressibility of finite nuclei have been reported @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the cdfm has been employed to calculate the scaling function in nuclei using the relativistic fermi gas scaling function and the result has been applied to lepton scattering processes @xcite .",
    "the cdfm analyses became useful to obtain information about the role of the nucleon momentum and density distributions for the explanation of superscaling in lepton - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the cdfm scaling function has been used to predict cross sections for several processes : inclusive electron scattering in the quasielastic and @xmath6 regions @xcite and neutrino ( antineutrino ) scattering both for charge - changing @xcite and for neutral - current @xcite processes .",
    "recently , the cdfm was applied to study the scaling function and its connection with the spectral function and the momentum distribution @xcite .    in our previous study @xcite , we analyzed within a deformed hf+bcs approach with skyrme - type density - dependent effective interactions the existence of a skin in nuclei far from the stability line by testing various definitions previously proposed @xcite .",
    "we have found that the neutron skin determined by the difference between neutron and proton radii using diffraction parameters defined in the helm model @xcite exhibits a more smooth , gradual increase with the neutron excess than the one obtained by means of definition from ref .  @xcite . as a result , the absolute size of the skin ranges from 0.4 fm when the helm model is used up to almost 1 fm for the heaviest isotopes using the criteria from ref .",

    "some particular investigations of the neutron skin thickness of neutron - rich nuclei and its connections with the symmetry energy have been performed in the droplet model with surface width dependence @xcite and in studies based on the landau - migdal approximation @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the relation between the neutron skin thickness and some nuclear matter properties in finite nuclei , such as the symmetry energy at the saturation point , symmetry pressure ( proportional to the slope of the bulk symmetry energy ) , and asymmetric compressibility , considering nuclei in given isotopic chains and within a certain theoretical approach .",
    "in addition to various linear relations between several quantities in bulk matter and for a given nucleus that have been observed and tested within different theoretical methods ( e.g. nonrelativistic calculations with different skyrme parameter sets and relativistic models ) , we are looking forward to establish a possible correlation between the skin thickness and these quantities and to clarify to what extent this correlation is appropriate for a given isotopic chain . as in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we choose some medium and heavy ni and sn isotopes , because , first , they are primary candidates to be measured at the upcoming experimental facilities , and second , for them several predictions have been made concerning the nuclear skin emergence . in addition , we present some results for a chain of pb isotopes being inspired by the significant interest ( in both experiment @xcite and theory @xcite ) to study , in particular , the neutron distribution of @xmath0pb and its rms radius .",
    "the densities of these nuclei were calculated within a deformed hf+bcs approach with skyrme - type density - dependent effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in ref .  @xcite demonstrated the ability of our microscopic theoretical method to predict the nuclear skin in exotic nuclei .",

    "_ @xcite that has been able to reproduce the binding energies and rms radii of light , medium , and heavy nuclei .",
    "the intrinsic properties of these nuclei are finally calculated in the cdfm framework that provides _ an extension to realistic finite nuclear systems_. the evolution of the symmetry energy as we increase the number of neutrons is also studied . additionally to ref .",

    "similarly to the case of ni isotopes with transition at specific shell closure , we observe a smooth growth of the symmetry energy till the double - magic nucleus @xmath123sn ( @xmath124 ) and then an almost linear decrease of @xmath99 while the neutron skin thickness of the isotopes increases . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have studied a formation of a neutron skin in tin isotopes with smaller @xmath42 where very poor experimental information is available .",
    "for instance , a large uncertainty is shown to exist experimentally in the neutron skin thickness of @xmath125sn , i.e. , its value varies from 0.1 to 0.3 fm depending on the experimental method .",

    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the symmetry energies deduced from different skyrme parametrizations vary in the interval 27 - 30 mev .",
    "similarly to the ni isotopic chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the lns force yields values of @xmath99 that overestimate the corresponding values of the other three skyrme - type interactions .",
    "also , the results for the symmetry energies calculated with both sg2 and sk3 forces are comparable . at the same time the slope of all curves",
    "remains almost constant . as can be seen from fig  [ fig8 ] , the values of @xmath98 for @xmath127sn and @xmath123sn obtained from our hf+bcs calculations with sly4 force fit very well the corresponding neutron skin thicknesses of @xmath128 fm and of @xmath129 fm of these nuclei derived from pygmy dipole resonances @xcite .",
    "moreover , both experimental and theoretical values follow a trend established by a measurement of the stable sn isotopes @xcite . on the other hand , the extended region of sn isotopes in the present study",
    "gives a good base for further measurements and systematic microscopic model calculations in order to assess the isospin dependence of the nuclear eos .    , but for sn isotopes .",

    "[ fig9 ] is given the evolution of the ratio @xmath130 for sn isotopes .",
    "a clear signal that a formation of a neutron skin can be expected to start at @xmath131 is seen in favour of the magic nature of @xmath123sn .",
    "additionally , there is an indication for a weak shell closure at @xmath132sn ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "as in the case of ni isotopes , the proportionality of the neutron skin thickness @xmath98 to the asymmetry parameter @xmath108 following from the liquid - drop mass formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:35 ] ) ] leads to a gradual linear increase of @xmath107 with @xmath42 also within the sn isotopic chain .",

    "[ fig9],width=302 ]    the kinks displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] by the ni isotopes and in figs .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig8 ] by the sn isotopes can be attributed to the shell structure of these exotic nuclei .",
    "indeed , the isotopic chains of ni and sn are of particular interest for nuclear structure calculations because of their proton shell closures at @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively",
    ". they also extend from the proton drip line that is found nearby the double - magic @xmath136ni ( see , for instance , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible proton skin formation ) and @xmath137sn nuclei to the already @xmath138 unstable neutron - rich double - magic @xmath103ni and @xmath123sn isotopes . in the case of @xmath103ni ( @xmath104 shell closure )",
    "the filling of the @xmath139 orbit is completed . beyond this isotope",
    "the @xmath140 subshell is being filled and a thick neutron skin is built up .",
    "similar picture is present for the sn isotopes .",
    "here , one finds a sudden jump beyond @xmath124 where the @xmath141 shell is filled and the @xmath142 subshell becomes populated .",
    "the situation in pb isotopes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is different from those of ni and sn isotopes - no kinks appear in the pb chain considered . in the case of @xmath0pb ( @xmath143 )",
    "the @xmath144 orbit is filled and above this nucleus the first occupied level is @xmath145 . as a result ,",
    "the bulk and surface contributions to the neutron skin thickness of neutron - rich sn and pb isotopes reveal an opposite effect , namely the surface part dominates the bulk one in tins , while for pb isotopes the bulk part is larger @xcite .",
    "as it has been shown by brown and typel ( see @xcite ) , and confirmed later by others @xcite , the neutron skin thickness ( [ eq:34 ] ) calculated in mean - field models with either nonrelativistic or relativistic effective interactions is very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and , in particular , to the slope parameter l ( respectively to the pressure @xmath100 [ eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] ) ] ) at the normal nuclear saturation density .",
    "we note that while the basic idea behind studies of this type of correlations , namely between the neutron skin thickness and the symmetry energy ( or the slope of the neutron eos ) , is to constrain the symmetry energy in bulk matter from experimental results in finite nuclei , the main aim of our work is to extract quantitative information about @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 values for finite nuclei in cdfm .",
    "moreover , so far in our work we presented another type of correlation , namely how these quantities are related to @xmath98 within a _ given isotopic chain _",
    "apart from the same one for a _ specific nucleus _ using different theoretical models . along this line",
    "we analyze the latter correlation and results for several sn ( @xmath123sn , @xmath146sn , @xmath147sn ) isotopes and @xmath103ni nucleus are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . using the four sets of skyrme interaction parameters , a linear fit to the correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath100",
    "is performed to illustrate qualitatively the above correlation .",
    "it is seen from figs .",
    "[ fig10](a ) and [ fig10](d ) that in the cases of double - magic @xmath123sn and @xmath103ni nuclei @xmath98 almost linearly correlates with @xmath100 .",
    "if one goes from @xmath123sn nucleus further to unstable nuclei within the same sn isotopic chain the correlation becomes weaker , as it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig10](b ) and [ fig10](c ) , being almost the same in the case of neighbouring @xmath146sn nucleus and poorly expressed in the case of far away @xmath147sn isotope . due to the limited number of skyrme parametrizations used in our theoretical approach , the results presented in fig .  [ fig10 ] can not provide a definite constraint of the slope ( @xmath100 value ) of the symmetry energy .",
    "obviously , more complete confirmation of the existing correlation between the neutron skin thickness and the pressure for a given nucleus can be drawn when large set of nuclear models may be considered .        finally , we would like to give estimations for the symmetry energy , pressure and incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter corresponding to the brueckner eos provided by the energy - density functional reported in refs .",
    "they are calculated at equilibrium density @xmath148 @xmath2 for which the energy per nucleon @xmath149 [ eq .  ( [ eq:20 ] ) ] has a minimum .",
    "the latter ( @xmath150 mev ) is reached from the brueckner formula at fermi momentum @xmath151 @xmath152 and at the value of @xmath148 @xmath2 used by us , as shown in refs .",
    "this value of @xmath15 is considered to be quite realistic @xcite . the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:24])([eq:24b ] ) leads to the following estimations : @xmath153 mev , @xmath154 mev/@xmath155 , and @xmath156 mev .",
    "it is seen that the symmetry energy is few mev above the experimental range 28 mev @xmath157 mev @xcite and the values deduced from our calculations for all finite nuclei considered .",
    "also , the values of @xmath21 and @xmath23 slightly overestimate the corresponding ones obtained in finite nuclei .",
    "actually , the problem that the surface symmetry energy is very poorly constrained in the current energy density functional parametrizations , as well as by available phenomenological estimates , has been recently indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite . to illustrate this fact we would like to present here new symmetry energy values derived from the extended ldm . by taking @xmath158 mev which , however , comes out from the brueckner eos and a smaller value of @xmath159 ( corresponding to the fit with ldm formula in @xcite ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq:35a ] ) gives values for the symmetry energy of 27.89 mev for @xmath103ni , 28.84 mev for @xmath123sn and 29.58 mev for @xmath0pb which are in a better agreement with the results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) . studying relationships between the neutron skin and various properties of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter",
    ", it follows from the comparison that our microscopic theoretical approach produces results for these properties consistent with those provided by the brueckner energy - density functional which may reduce the uncertainties of their future experimental extraction .",
    "in this work , a theoretical approach to the nuclear many - body problem combining the deformed hf+bcs method with skyrme - type density - dependent effective interactions @xcite and the coherent density fluctuation model @xcite has been used to study nuclear properties of finite nuclei . for this purpose",
    ", we examined three chains of neutron - rich ni , sn , and pb isotopes , most of them being far from the stability line and representing an interest for future measurements with radioactive exotic beams .",
    "four skyrme parametrizations were involved in the calculations : sg2 , sk3 , sly4 , and lns .",
    "in addition to the interactions used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lns effective interaction was used in the present paper , because it has been built up from the eos of nuclear matter including effects of three - body forces @xcite .    for the first time",
    ", we have demonstrated the capability of cdfm to be applied as an alternative way to make a transition _ from the properties of nuclear matter to the properties of finite nuclei _ investigating the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath99 , the neutron pressure @xmath100 and the asymmetric compressibility @xmath101 in finite nuclei .",
    "this has been carried out on the base of the brueckner energy - density functional for infinite nuclear matter .",
    "mainly , the symmetry energy has been determined from analyzing nuclear masses within liquid - drop models , while much more effort has been recently devoted to extracting the value of its slope parameter . instead of this , in the present work we applied the cdfm scheme .",
    "one of the advantages of the cdfm is the possibility to obtain transparent relations for the intrinsic eos quantities analytically by means of a convenient approach to the weight function .",
    "the key element of this model is the choice of density distributions which were taken from self - consistent deformed hf+bcs calculations .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our new method allows one to estimate the symmetry energy and , therefore , the symmetry - energy coefficient in finite nuclei thus avoiding the problems related to fitting the hartree - fock energies to a ldm parametrization .",
    "we have found that there exists an approximate linear correlation between the neutron skin thickness of even - even nuclei from the ni ( @xmath102 ) , sn ( @xmath122 ) , and pb ( @xmath160 ) isotopic chains and their nuclear symmetry energies .",
    "our hf+bcs calculations lead to a symmetry energy in the range of 27 - 30 mev , which is in agreement with the empirical value of @xmath161 mev @xcite and with the results of nikolov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in the cases of ni and sn isotopes",
    "the symmetry energy is found to increase almost linearly with the mass number @xmath42 till the double - magic nuclei ( @xmath103ni and @xmath123sn ) and then to decrease , being larger when lns force is used . a similar linear correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath100",
    "is also found to exist , while the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath162 is less pronounced . the same behavior containing an inflexion point transition at specific shell closure is observed for these correlations .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath163 mev/@xmath155 obtained in our calculations lead to values of the slope parameter @xmath164 mev that are in agreement with other theoretical predictions ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the study of other two eos parameters ( whose determination is more uncertain than the symmetry energy ) , namely the slope and the curvature of @xmath99 , performed in our work may provide more constraints on both the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the thickness of the neutron skin in neutron - rich medium and heavy nuclei .    in the present work ,",
    "the role of the relative neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath108 on the size of the neutron skin @xmath98 was studied for ni and sn isotopes . for this purpose",
    "the results for the ratio @xmath107 were presented and a comparison with its estimation using the extended liquid - drop mass formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:35 ] ) ] was made .",
    "the hf+bcs results show that a formation of a neutron skin can be expected to start at @xmath165 and @xmath131 for ni and sn isotopes , respectively .",
    "although the proportionality that exists between @xmath98 and @xmath108 in ( [ eq:35 ] ) produces smooth change of @xmath98 with @xmath42 , the size of the neutron skin in both cases is consistent with the results of other calculations with the sly4 parametrization @xcite , as well as with results of spherical self - consistent hfb calculations with finite - range forces of the gogny type @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed that the neutron skins in nuclei with a large neutron excess near and beyond the drip line are very clearly related to the asymmetry parameter @xmath108 .",
    "however , the shell effects , which are always present in mean - field calculations , produce deviations from the linear dependence between @xmath98 and @xmath108 in these nuclei .",
    "summarizing , in this work we use a microscopic theoretical approach to study important macroscopic nuclear matter quantities in finite nuclei and their relation to surface properties of neutron - rich exotic nuclei .",
    "we have shown that this approach gives a very reasonable description of the neutron skin thicknesses of several sn isotopes which have been experimentally measured .",
    "a good agreement is achieved with other theoretical predictions for the volume symmetry energies of ni isotopes , as well as for the pressure and asymmetric compressibility of nuclei within the pb isotopic chain .",
    "the capability of the present method can be further demonstrated by taking into consideration skyrme - type and relativistic nuclear energy - density functionals . in this way , more systematic analysis of the relationship between the symmetry energy and the neutron skin thickness will be carried out and more definite conclusions on its isotopic sensitivity will be drawn .",
