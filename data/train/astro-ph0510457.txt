    "psrb182313 is a 101 ms evolved pulsar with a spin - down age of @xmath8 years ( for an assumed braking index of @xmath9 ) @xcite and in these properties very similar to the vela pulsar .",
    "it is located at a distance of @xmath10 kpc @xcite . high resolution _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations of the pulsar region confirmed a previous _ rosat _ detection of an asymmetric diffuse nebula , which was hence given the name g18.00.7 @xcite .",
    "for the compact core with extent @xmath11 ( cn : compact nebula ) immediately surrounding the pulsar , a photon index of @xmath12 was measured with an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath13 ergs@xmath14 in the 0.5 to 10 kev range for a distance of @xmath15 kpc .",
    "the corresponding pulsar wind shock radius is @xmath16 pc .",
    "the compact core is embedded in a region of extended diffuse emission which is clearly one - sided , revealing a structure south of the pulsar , with an extension of @xmath17 , ( en : extended nebula ) whereas the @xmath18 east - west extension is symmetric around the north - south axis .",
    "the spectrum of this extended component is softer with a photon index of @xmath19 , with an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath20 ergs@xmath14 for the 0.5 to 10 kev interval .",
    "no associated supernova remnant ( snr ) has been identified yet .",
    "at @xmath21-ray energies , psrb182313 was proposed to power the close - by unidentified egret source 3egj18261302 @xcite .",
    "the region around psrb182313 was observed as part of the survey of the galactic plane with the h.e.s.s .",
    "instrument @xcite . in this survey ,",
    "a source of very high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath21-rays ( hessj1825137 ) 11@xmath22 south of the pulsar was discovered with a significance of 8.1 @xmath0 .",
    "we note , that the new vhe @xmath21-ray source is located within the 95% positional confidence level of the egret source 3egj18261302 and could therefore be related to this as of yet unidentified object . more details of the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations , analyses and merits of the possible association of hessj1825 - 137 with g18.00.7 was discussed by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows a north - south declination slice of g18.00.7 in x - rays and hessj1825137 in @xmath21-rays .",
    "both images show that the emission peaks at the position of psrb1823 - 13 , but with extended emission shifted towards the south .",
    "the prominent x - ray synchrotron peak at the pulsar position is as a result of the compact x - ray nebula , where the magnetic field strength should be largest . whereas the extent of the x - ray emission is only @xmath23 arcmin ,",
    "the tev emission is seen out to @xmath24 . even though the position of the unpulsed egret source 3egj18261302 is consistent with that of hessj1825137 @xcite , the poor angular resolution of the egret instrument precludes a similar morphological study .",
    "( a ) left : north - south declination slice of g18.00.7 in x - rays @xcite showing the bright compact nebular core at the pulsar position and the @xmath25 extended x - ray nebula extending to the south of psrb182313 ( indicated by a vertical line ) .",
    "( b ) right : similar slice for hessj1825137 , showing a similar extension south of the pulsar , but with a much larger size of @xmath24.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the one - sided nature of this pwn as seen in tev was already suggested by @xcite , for the x - rays , based on the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite for vela x and earlier studies referenced by @xcite : it was assumed that the density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) around the progenitor star was inhomogeneous along the north - south direction , with the density / pressure towards the northern direction significantly larger relative to the south .",
    "the reverse shock from the northern direction should then have crashed relatively early into the pwn , pushing the latter towards the south , as observed .",
    "the remaining problem with the association of hessj1825137 with g18.00.7/psrb182313 is the anomalously large size of the tev source : the @xmath26 diameter of the source translates to a radius of @xmath27 pc , and in the absence of radiative cooling in a snr shell , one would expect a snr forward shock radius of @xmath28 pc @xcite . one possible key towards solving this problem would be to consider a relatively large initial spindown power ( @xmath29 ) and pulsar braking index less than the canonical value of @xmath9 , which would increase the age @xmath30 of the snr .",
    "integrating the spindown power @xmath31 over the increased age would also maximise the @xmath32 work done by the pwn against the snr .",
    "the sedov - taylor snr size would also increase with increasing age ( scaling as @xmath33 ) , giving a radius of @xmath34 here @xmath35 ergs is the sn explosion energy and @xmath36 @xmath7 is the density of the hot phase of the ism @xcite .",
    "a pulsar braking index of @xmath37 ( `` lmc pulsar '' type ) will increase the age of psrb182313 to @xmath38 kyr if we assume a relatively large @xmath29 ( i.e. an initial spin period much less than 0.1 s ) .",
    "this will imply a size consistent with the predicted size of @xmath39 pc .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the evolution of @xmath40 with time for different values of @xmath41 and @xmath29 : it is also clear that the total pwn energy is maximised for minimum @xmath41 and maximal value of @xmath29 , but it is not yet clear how to relate this time dependent spindown power to the evolution of the pwn in a quantitave way .     (",

    "the arrow indicates the @xmath32 work required to displace the observed pwn volume against a pressure of 5 ev/@xmath42 .",
    "the vertical position of the arrow would then scale linearly with pressure .",

    "aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite derived the spectrum of hessj1825137 , which can be represented by a power law in energy , with photon index @xmath43 and a flux above 230  gev of @xmath44 @xmath45s@xmath14 ( corresponding to 12% of the crab flux above that energy ) .",
    "this spectrum is shown in figure 2 ( b ) , together with the x - ray spectra of g18.00.7 @xcite and 3egj18261302 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the tev spectrum of hessj1825137 does not extrapolate towards gev energies , and a spectral flattening below @xmath46 gev is required .",
    "this spectral break may be the result of a cooling effect , which is also seen in x - rays : the compact nebular x - ray photon spectral index of @xmath47 represents the uncooled component , whereas the photon index of @xmath4 measured from the extended x - ray nebula , represents the synchrotron cooled component ( as a result of propagation effects ) .",
    "the tev photon index of @xmath3 is then consistent with inverse compton scattering of these synchrotron cooled electrons on the cmbr , provided that this cooled spectrum also extends into the euv / soft x - ray band , where electrons contribute directly to the observed tev emission for a field strength of @xmath48 g or less .",
    "the expected intrinsic break in the injected spectrum , represented by the so - called `` @xmath49-factor '' of the wind at the pulsar wind shock of the compact nebula may also contribute to the observed flattening : in this case the number spectrum of electrons with energy @xmath50 is expected to follow an accelerated power law spectrum of the form @xmath51 , resulting in the observed ( uncooled ) compact nebular spectrum with a photon index of 1.6 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "electrons with energy @xmath52 is then expected to have a much harder spectrum .",
    "this component is however unconstrained by radio or optical observations .",
    "we also note that the energy flux in tev is larger than the synchrotron energy flux of the extended x - ray nebula .",
    "this dominance of the tev flux holds even if we extrapolate the spectrum of the extended x - ray nebula to the euv / soft x - ray band .",
    "the evaluation of this soft synchrotron component is important , since electrons contributing to this soft unseen component , also scatter cmbr photons into the h.e.s.s .",
    "band for field strengths of @xmath48 g or less : note that the _ xmm _ x - ray spectrum is only measured within @xmath53 from the pulsar , whereas electrons contributing to this soft band should have a much longer lifetime",
    ". they can therefore propagate to larger distances ( as seen in tev ) , resulting in a population of accumulated electrons over the lifetime of the pulsar , whereas the x - rays seen in figure 2 ( b ) represent synchrotron emission from freshly injected electrons .",
    "this accumulation effect should increase the intensity of the soft component accordingly .",
    "thus , the soft unseen synchrotron component should have a similar size as seen in tev . a test for this hypothesis would be to measure the size of g18.00.7 in the softest channels of xmm over an area similar to the tev size .",
    "a more detailed study is however required to model the intensity of this unseen soft synchrotron component .",
    "the respective synchrotron lifetimes of electrons in a transverse magnetic field of strength @xmath54 g , radiating synchrotron photons with mean energy @xmath55 ( in units of kev ) and inverse compton scattered cmbr photons to a mean @xmath21-ray energy of @xmath56 ( in units of tev ) , are given by @xmath57",
