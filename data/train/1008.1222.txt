    "a simply connected elliptic surface @xmath4 with a section is called an @xmath5 surface if @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "an @xmath5 surface has topological euler characteristic @xmath8 .",
    "all @xmath5 surfaces are diffeomorphic for fixed @xmath9 , and an @xmath5 surface is symplectically isomorphic to the fiber sum of @xmath9 copies of a rational elliptic surface @xmath10 .",
    "recall that an @xmath10 surface is obtained from @xmath11 by blowing up the base points of a pencil of cubics , and an @xmath12 surface is an elliptic k3 surface with a section .",
    "recently , jongil park and the second named author constructed a simply connected minimal surface of general type with @xmath1 and @xmath13 via @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing of a singular rational surface @xcite .",
    "this singular rational surface is obtained by contracting linear chains of rational curves in a blow - up of an @xmath10 surface with singular fibers of special type .",
    "the other constructions of surfaces of general type with @xmath1 via @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , use different @xmath10 surfaces , but all employ the same arguments as in @xcite to prove the vanishing @xmath15 , which is a key ingredient to guarantee the existence of a @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing .",
    "we remark that several statements in @xcite can be generalized to the case of @xmath5 surfaces and to the case of elliptic surfaces without a section .",
    "is it possible to construct an interesting complex surface via @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing of a singular surface obtained by contracting linear chains of rational curves in a blow - up of an @xmath5 surface with @xmath16 , or of an enriques surface ?    in this paper , we will treat mainly the case of enriques surfaces .",
    "since an enriques surface has multiple fibres , the method of @xcite for the case of an @xmath10 surface can not be applied directly to prove the existence of a global @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by passing to the k3-cover ( an @xmath12 surface ) and then by showing that the obstruction space of the corresponding singular surface has trivial invariant part under the covering involution .",
    "using some special enriques surfaces , we are able to construct minimal surfaces of general type with @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "each of our examples has ample canonical class , i.e. , contains no @xmath19-curve .",
    "there have been constructed several examples of a minimal surface of general type with @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 , by barlow @xcite , by inoue @xcite and recently by bauer and pignatelli @xcite .",
    "each of these examples contains a @xmath19-curve .",
    "we do not know if our example with @xmath20 is deformation equivalent to one of these examples .",
    "as for examples with @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath21 , the existence is known only for @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , cartwright and steger @xcite recently found examples with @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath22 by taking the minimal resolution of the quotient of a fake projective plane by an order 3 automorphism .",
    "by @xcite , the quotient of a fake projective plane by an order 3 automorphism has @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and 3 singular points of type @xmath23 .",
    "they computed the fundamental groups of all possible quotients to find that some quotients have @xmath17 .",

    "table 1 of @xcite gives a list of minimal surfaces of general type with @xmath25 and @xmath26 available in the literature .",
    "we remark that our method can not produce minimal surfaces of general type with @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the reason is that singular surfaces @xmath28 appearing in our construction satisfy the vanishing @xmath15 , which we need to ensure the existence of a global @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing . by the upper semi - continuity",
    ", the condition @xmath15 implies @xmath29 for a general member @xmath30 of a @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing . since @xmath31 the dimension of the deformation space of @xmath30 is equal to @xmath32 , and hence there is no nontrivial deformation of @xmath30 if @xmath33 . the case of @xmath5 with @xmath34",
    "were worked out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath35 will be treated in the last section .",
    "a key ingredient in the case of @xmath5 is to show that there is a @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing of singular points simultaneously even if there is an obstruction to @xmath14-gorenstein smoothing for each singular point .    throughout this paper , we follow kodaira s notation for singular fibers of elliptic fibration @xcite , and we work over the field of complex numbers .",
