    "properties of the solvation force in various condensed matter systems have been the subject of very intensive research during recent years @xcite .",
    "lattice models play special role among considered systems .",
    "although many important results were obtained in this field by different methods of taking into account fluctuations which determine the properties of the analyzed systems , the approach based on the exact evaluation of the partition function via the transfer matrix method still plays a distinguished role .",
    "below we report our results on the properties of the solvation force for 2d ising strip .",
    "they are obtained via exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix which is then followed by numerical solutions of equations for eigenvalues .",
    "we consider ising model on a two  dimensional square lattice consisting of @xmath0 rows and @xmath1 columns .",
    "there is no bulk magnetic field acting on the system and there are two surface fields : @xmath2 acts on spins in the first row and @xmath3 acts on the @xmath0-th row .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model takes the standard form @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 denotes the spin located in the @xmath7-th column and @xmath8-th row , and @xmath9 is the coupling constant .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction are imposed : @xmath10 .",
    "our purpose is to determine the properties of the solvation force experienced by the system boundaries . in the following we consider two cases : the symmetric case ( s ) corresponds to @xmath11 , and for the antisymmetric case ( as ) one has @xmath12 .",
    "although the strip of finite width experiences no phase transition , we shall often refer to two critical temperatures : the bulk critical temperature @xmath13 , and the wetting temperature @xmath14 which characterizes the critical wetting transition in a semi  infinite system with surface field @xmath15 .",
    "the wetting temperature fulfills the equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant . for a small surface field @xmath2",
    "this equation leads to @xmath20 for @xmath21 one has @xmath22 and there is no wetting transition .",
    "the dimensionless free energy per one column is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the canonical partition function for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) which we evaluate using the exact transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "the free energy may be separated into three types of contributions @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bulk free energy per one spin @xcite and @xmath27 is the surface free energy ; both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath0independent .",
    "the remaining term @xmath28 describes the interaction between the system boundaries .",
    "it tends to 0 as @xmath0 goes to infinity and from this term the solvation force originates .",
    "the solvation force is , in general , defined as the minus derivative of @xmath28 wrt @xmath0 . in our case , because @xmath0 takes only integer values , we use the definition @xmath29,\\ ] ] which leads to the following expression @xmath30    the solvation force for the 2d strip has been already analyzed in the @xmath22 case @xcite corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "our analysis covers the whole spectrum @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . to calculate the solvation force we used the methods described in @xcite . the complete analysis ( including also the inhomogeneous boundary fields )",
    "will be published elsewhere @xcite ; here we discuss only the main results .",
    "first we briefly discuss the symmetric case ( s ) .",
    "the corresponding solvation force @xmath34 is plotted in fig.[fig1 ] for two cases : @xmath35 ( solid curve ) and @xmath22 ( broken curve ) .",
    "the difference between these two functions is only of quantitative nature  decreasing the surface field @xmath15 , i.e. increasing the wetting temperature @xmath14 results in decreasing the absolute value of the solvation force .",
    "the minimum of the solvation force @xmath34 is located at @xmath36 .",
    "comparison of the solvation force @xmath34 for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) ( solid curve ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath39 ) ( broken curve ) for symmetric case @xmath40 .",
    "both curves correspond to the value @xmath41 . ]    for opposite surface fields ( as ) the solvation force @xmath42 in the @xmath43 case , i.e. , @xmath44 , differs substantially from the @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath39 case .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] presents a typical plot of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath45 . for low temperatures",
    "this force is negative ( attractive ) and has a minimum at @xmath46 .",
    "the solvation force is negative at wetting temperature and has a zero at @xmath47 above @xmath48 the solvation force is positive ( repulsive ) and has a maximum at @xmath49 ( for @xmath0 large enough ) .",
    "this remains in contrast with the @xmath22 case in which the solvation force is positive for all temperatures .",
    "exactly at the bulk critical temperature @xmath50 the dependence of the solvation force on @xmath0 has been found using conformal invariance @xcite @xmath51 this result , in particular the universal values of the amplitudes , has been reproduced by our analysis .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we exclusively discuss the antisymmetric case ( as ) .",
    "the solvation force @xmath42 as a function of temperature for @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) and @xmath41 in the antisymmetric case @xmath12 .",
    "note that the difference between the zero of the solvation force @xmath48 and the wetting temperature @xmath14 is not visible in this scale . ]",
    "first we concentrate on the temperature @xmath48 at which the solvation force becomes zero .",
    "we have found that for fixed @xmath54 and for @xmath55 this temperature approaches the wetting temperature @xmath14 exponentially @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive functions of the surface field @xmath2 . ) to our numerical results .",
    "however , for @xmath59 and for @xmath60 the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath14 is of order of numerical errors and we were unable to precisely determine the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "] we have found that for @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 one has @xmath63    we note that this result is different from the corresponding result obtained within the mean field theory where @xmath48 is exponentially shifted _ below _",
    "it is also different form the corresponding result obtained for the restricted solid  on  solid ( rsos ) model , where @xmath48 is _ equal _ to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the scaling function that describes the behavior of the solvation force @xmath64 for large @xmath0 and subcritical temperatures .",
    "the relevant scaling function @xmath65 has already been proposed to describe @xmath42 in the @xmath22 case @xcite @xmath66 the correlation length for 2d ising model close to @xmath50 is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the scaling function @xmath65 can be obtained numerically from the transfer matrix spectrum and some of its properties can be proved analytically ( see eq.([casimir ] ) and @xcite ) , namely @xmath70 here we would like to extend this result to @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath43 case .    for 2d ising model the gap exponent @xmath72 and for @xmath73 the following scaling behavior @xmath74 where @xmath75 comes into play in the limit @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 fixed .",
    "this implies additionally the @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath62 limits .",
    "the coefficient @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] in eq.([a0 ] ) has been introduced such that the value @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath83 and then eq.([wettemp ] ) is satisfied . for @xmath84 eq.([fscale ] ) gives the solvation force @xmath42 below the wetting temperature and for @xmath85 above @xmath14 .",
    "convergence of the scaling function .",

    "all plots were obtained from @xmath86 for @xmath89 . ]    the scaling function @xmath88 plotted for @xmath90 and the scaling function @xmath91 .",

    "we note that a different way of obtaining the function @xmath88 , based on the least squares method which allows to calculate the functions @xmath88 and @xmath96 in eq.([yyy ] ) , leads to similar results ( the differences are not visible on the scale of our figures ) .",
    "the plots of function @xmath88 are shown on fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "next we investigate the relation between the scaling functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the function @xmath98 is calculated in the limit @xmath55 , @xmath99 with @xmath2 and @xmath100 fixed . by applying this limit to eqs ( [ fscale ] ) and ( [ fscalex ] ) one",

    "the zeros of the scaling function are denoted by @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "we have found that for large @xmath77 the function @xmath103 approaches @xmath105 exponentially form above .",

    "the scaling function @xmath115 was proposed to describe the behavior of the solvation force for @xmath73 in the limit @xmath61 and @xmath116 , see figs [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] .",
    "we checked that in the limit of high surface field ( @xmath117 in eq.([fscale ] ) ) this scaling function approached the scaling function describing the scaling behavior of the for solvation force in the @xmath22 case .",
    "in addition , the zeros of the scaling function were investigated to find the formula for @xmath113 in the @xmath61 limit .",
