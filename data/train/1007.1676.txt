    "much of our knowledge about the distribution and properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has come from samples that are flux - limited at blue optical wavelengths .",
    "this is because their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) generally exhibit a uv flux excess .",
    "such surveys can be very efficient and complete down to their blue flux limit , for example , the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , any survey with a blue - flux limit will be relatively biased against objects whose intrinsic emission peaks at other wavelengths , e.g. , near - ir emission from the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the optical / uv can be partially or heavily absorbed by dust , as revealed by radio , near - to - mid infrared , and x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has employed a range of multicolor optical selection techniques with relaxed constraints on morphology to search for qsos to redshifts of @xmath9 .",
    "this has reduced the bias relative to the simple uv - excess criteria used in early surveys , but has not eliminated it .",
    "a complete census of agn over cosmic time is essential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution since the properties of the central black hole and host galaxy are intimately linked ( see reviews in * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of agn missing from optically selected samples , both as a function of redshift and luminosity is an important parameter .",
    "this is expected to be related to the duty cycle of black - hole fueling and timescales for regulating star formation .",
    "values are currently very uncertain and range from 15 to over 50% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this uncertainty is due to selection of the appropriate comparison sample of optically selected agn , properties of the `` unbiased '' sample and how representative it is , and difficulties in quantifying the amount of bias ( e.g. , dust extinction ) .",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to construct a complete @xmath10-band  limited qso sample by combining optical and near - ir photometry .",
    "this exploits the characteristic k - band excess seen in qsos compared to stars and has been termed the kx - selection method .",
    "a number of small pilot surveys have employed kx - selection and variants thereof ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the largest is being compiled from the ukidss large area survey covering  12.8 deg@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this survey currently reports a surface density of @xmath12 deg@xmath13 for broad - lined agn with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "they estimated that about 50% were missed by sdss , therefore revealing a large population of red qsos .",
    "although the kx method is turning up many luminous red qsos to high redshift , the situation is different for less luminous local agn ( e.g. , seyfert nuclei ) .",
    "these are usually not found by color selection since host galaxy light can dominate their broadband colors .",
    "historically , they are found by taking optical spectra of the nuclear regions of large samples of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many of these samples are flux - limited at blue optical wavelengths and hence subject to bias .",
    "the most significant bias is that the blue light is dominated by recent star formation which overwhelms any emission from a central agn .",
    "a near - ir selected sample of local galaxies using color criteria analogous to that used in kx methods will reduce this bias ( see below ) .",
    "the largest near - ir survey to date is the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    ". there have been several studies that searched for agn in 2mass .",
    "the first was that from @xcite in the northern equatorial sky .",
    "they selected sources with @xmath0 and @xmath16 is similar to the @xmath10 filter but cutting off at a shorter red wavelength to minimize thermal emission .",
    "] at galactic latitude @xmath17 .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up revealed that @xmath18 were previously unidentified agn , with @xmath19 of these associated with broad emission - line ( type 1 ) agn , i.e. , seyfert 1s and qsos , and the remainder were narrow - line ( type 2 ) agn , typically seyfert 2s , type 2 qsos and liners .",
    "they spanned a redshift range of @xmath20 with a median of @xmath21 , therefore , the agn were predominately local .",
    "the extrapolated surface density of all agn types was @xmath22 deg@xmath13 and is significantly higher than that of optically selected agn at the same @xmath23 magnitude .",
    "a significant fraction also showed unusually high polarization properties @xcite and very weak x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "other 2mass studies involved cross - correlating with the first radio catalog @xcite .",
    "these turned up a number of extremely red qsos at high redshift , some showing strong evidence for dust .",
    "@xcite studied the 2mass colors of qsos identified at other wavelengths , primarily from the @xcite catalog , and @xcite used mid and far ir observations of red 2mass agn to infer their relationship to luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "most of these studies however used single band 2mass detections ( in @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath23 ) and therefore could have missed many red agn . furthermore",
    ", none were able to provide a census of agn in the 2mass catalog .",
    "a uniform unbiased survey of 2mass agn was carried out by @xcite by selecting candidates in the southern hemisphere covering 12.56 deg@xmath11 using a moderate color cut of @xmath26 .",
    "this color cut significantly reduced contamination from foreground stars .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up revealed that @xmath27 were broad - line agn and @xmath28 were galaxies with seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "the main findings were that : ( i ) the type 1 agn are predominately at low redshifts ( @xmath29 ) and contamination from host galaxy light would make them hard to find in optically selected qso samples ( e.g. , the sdss ) ; ( ii ) the incidence of type 2 agn amongst local galaxies is higher than usual when compared to blue - selected galaxy samples .",
    "the results of this study are complementary to those presented here and will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "the above studies indicate that 2mass is sensitive to the local agn population .",
    "the luminosity of broad - lined qsos in particular in the local universe is only slightly greater than that of their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "only a small amount of dust extinction is needed to mis - identify them or turn them into type 2 agn .",
    "this is in contrast to the heavily obscured , high - luminosity , and usually unresolved qsos at high redshift .",
    "therefore , even though near - ir color - selected surveys are less biased than those in the optical / uv , they are still somewhat biased against the reddest qsos .",
    "they do however have the advantage that candidates selected in the near - ir will be bright enough to allow spectroscopic followup with relative ease .",
    "it is worth mentioning why a red @xmath30 color cut has proven so efficient at finding agn in the relatively shallow 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) .",
    "there are three reasons .",
    "first , contamination from halo giant and disk dwarf stars is very much eliminated , where the majority have @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "second , the 2mass colors of galaxies are predominately blue , with a median @xmath32 at @xmath33 and a 1-@xmath34 upper limit of @xmath35 at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this color reddens rapidly for galaxies at higher redshifts due to the @xmath37-correction , approaching @xmath38 at @xmath39",
    ". however , typical @xmath40 galaxies at such redshifts will be well below the detection limit of the 2mass psc .",
    "contamination from non - active galaxies is therefore expected to be small overall .",
    "the third reason is motivated by the fact that an extremal color cut of @xmath0 has been shown to discriminate red agn from uv / optically - selected ones in large samples of known agn @xcite .",
    "for example , 2mass detects a large fraction ( @xmath18 ) of the lbqs qsos in all three near - ir bands ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "most of these have @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 isolates the reddest subset of the optically selected population and is likely to probe many more .",
    "it is also interesting to note that nearly all known qsos at @xmath42 have @xmath26 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the work of @xcite and @xcite to search for additional red 2mass agn in the southern equatorial sky .",
    "we assembled a relatively unbiased sample of red agn candidates using a color cut of @xmath0 on the 2mass point source working database and then used the brute - force capabilities of the six degree field ( 6df ) multiobject spectrograph to obtain spectra of a subsample .",
    "we utlized the efficient mapping strategy of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) with our candidates selected as secondary targets in the program .",
    "our sample and target selection are described in section 2 .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in section 3 , and spectral classifications in section 4 .",
    "properties of the newly discovered agn and comparisons to optically selected qso samples are discussed in section 5 .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology with @xmath43mpc@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . all magnitudes ,",
    "unless otherwise specified , are based on the vega system .",
    "candidates were initially selected from the 2mass point source working database using the following criteria : a color cut of @xmath0 ; @xmath16 ; detections in all three bands ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 ) ; galactic latitude @xmath47 ; and excluding a region of @xmath48 deg@xmath11 covering the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "previously identified sources were not omitted .",
    "this yielded 16,977 candidates in an effective area of @xmath49 deg@xmath11 over the whole sky .",
    "these criteria define the `` master '' catalog of red agn candidates , and were used in northern hemisphere follow - up studies by @xcite .",
    "note that a detection in the h - band was included for reliability .",
    "the red agn candidate selection criteria were originally devised during the early stages of the survey before many of the source quality metrics were mature .",
    "sources detected in all three survey bands were known to be of the highest reliability .",
    "therefore , three - band detection was included with the two - band color limit to minimize sample contamination by spurious sources with unusual colors .",
    "southern equatorial ( @xmath50 ) agn candidates from the master catalog were then position matched against the supercosmos sky survey database @xcite . a match radius of @xmath51 arcsec was used and no optical magnitude cut was initially imposed .",
    "@xmath52 of matches resulted in multiple ( ambiguous ) associations and were excluded .",
    "this yielded 6386 matches with an overall position - difference dispersion of @xmath53 arcsec . a sample of 2260 candidates",
    "was then compiled by selecting sources with supercosmos magnitudes of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these limits were required to obtain good signal - to - noise ratio spectra ( @xmath56 10/pixel ) and enable reliable identifications .",
    "the reliability of the supercosmos optical detections to these magnitude limits is expected to be @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the single @xmath58 and @xmath59 band photometry has an accuracy of @xmath60 mag while due to specifics of the calibration procedure , @xmath61 colors are expected to have an accuracy of @xmath62 mag ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the 2260 candidates were then proposed for follow - up with the 6df multifibre spectrograph .",
    "1182 were eventually allocated fibers , mainly as secondary targets during scheduling of observations for the 6dfgs @xcite .",
    "our objects were distributed over an effective non - contiguous area of @xmath63 deg@xmath11 .",
    "it s important to note that our initial sample of candidates ( with @xmath0 ) was selected from an early version of the 2mass point source working database .",
    "subsequent recalibration and selection of alternate observations of some of these sources for inclusion in the final 2mass psc resulted in some of them having colors @xmath41 . in the end",
    ", the majority of sources classified as agn had @xmath64 , with @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 according to photometry in the public - release psc .",
    "uncertainties in the @xmath30 colors were typically @xmath67 mag ( 1-@xmath34 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained over the course of the 6dfgs during 2001 - 2006 using the uk schmidt telescope and the 6df spectrograph @xcite . for details on the 6dfgs observing strategy ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the primary sample for the 6dfgs was drawn from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ; * ? ? ?",
    "seventeen additional ( secondary ) extragalactic samples were merged with the primary sample ( see table 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during survey design ,",
    "these were given priority indices and our initial sample of 2260 candidates had a completeness in coverage of 91.7% .",
    "this gave @xmath68 agn candidates per 6df field on average , although not all 6dfgs fields contained our targets because of the different galactic latitude constraints .",
    "the 6df multifiber spectrograph was able to record up to 120 simultaneous spectra over a @xmath69 field .",
    "each fiber has a projected diameter of @xmath70 arcsec on the sky .",
    "the 2mass positions were accurate to @xmath71 arcsec and therefore light losses due to fiber positioning errors were expected to be small . for the 10@xmath7290@xmath72 percentile range in redshift for the extragalactic identifications , @xmath730.45 , the fiber diameter corresponds to physical scales of @xmath74 to 38.7 kpc @xmath75 .",
    "this means the 6df spectra sampled light from entire galaxies , and not necessarily their nuclei .",
    "each spectrum was taken using v and r gratings , whose outputs were later spliced to cover the effective wavelength range : @xmath76 39007500 .",
    "the observed @xmath77 was typically 3 - 10 pixel@xmath44 , with @xmath78 pixel@xmath44 being nominal given the brightness of our sources .",
    "spectra with low @xmath77 were primarily due to poor observing conditions .",
    "the spectral resolution was typically @xmath79 throughout , corresponding to emission - line full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of @xmath76 48   over the observed wavelength range .",
    "this enabled us to resolve rest - frame velocities of @xmath80 over the range @xmath730.45 , sufficient for agn identification and classification .",
    "the data were reduced , spectra extracted , and wavelength calibrated using a modified version of the 2dfdr package developed for the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "details of the reduction are described in @xcite and products from the final data release ( dr3 ; april 2009 ) are described in @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration was very crude in that the same average spectral transfer function ( derived once using a couple of standards ) was assumed for every 6df observation for all time .",
    "the spectra are therefore not of spectrophotometric quality .",
    "this severely limited our classification process , e.g. , using emission line ratios ( section 4 ) .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric absorption and emission features .",
    "however in some cases , imperfect sky - subtraction has left the imprint of the brightest sky lines .",
    "quality flags were assigned by the semi - automated 6dfgs redshift determination pipeline ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "almost all redshifts were visually inspected by the 6dfgs team .",
    "quality flags in the range @xmath8114 were assigned in the final public catalog .",
    "@xmath82 represents a very reliable redshift where typically the median spectral @xmath77 was @xmath83 pixel@xmath44 .",
    "@xmath84 was assigned to `` likely '' redshift and @xmath85 to tentative redshift with spectra warranting further examination .",
    "we visually examined all spectra with quality flags @xmath86 , although the majority of usuable spectra had @xmath87 and a handful had @xmath88 . due to the faintness of the sources in general , 750 of the 1182 spectra observed were of such poor quality that no classification was possible .",
    "classifications were therefore secured for 432 spectra .",
    "figure  [ classhistok ] shows the number of proposed agn candidates ( using the optical / near - ir constraints defined in section 2 ) , the number of 6df spectra observed , and the number with secure spectral identifications as a function of @xmath23 magnitude .",
    "the dearth of candidates in the faintest bin , @xmath89 is due to a combination of our optical magnitude limits ( see below ) and the original @xmath0 cutoff .",
    "this cutoff implies @xmath90 for @xmath91 and hence a fraction of sources are expected to fall below the @xmath24-band flux limit and excluded from the candidate list .",
    "this drop was also seen in the @xcite sample of 704 candidates _ with _ follow - up optical spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ classhistojmk ] shows that we are not significantly biased against identifying sources with the reddest @xmath92 colors .",
    "in fact , the spectral identification rate as a function of @xmath92 is approximately uniform .",
    "figure  [ classhistok ] shows that the number of spectra observed uniformally samples the @xmath23 distribution of candidates , i.e. , the completeness is approximately uniform .",
    "however , there is relatively higher incompleteness in the number of spectra _ identified _ at the faintest magnitudes : @xmath93 .",
    "the incompleteness in this range is @xmath94 with respect to the number of spectra observed .",
    "this is primarily due to the faintest sources generally having poorer quality spectra .",
    "these are expected to be near the optical magnitude limit imposed for spectroscopy : @xmath95 . in fact , the introduction of an optical magnitude cut is expected to have biased the spectral sample towards bluer optical colors in general . comparing the relative deficit in the number of faint ( @xmath96 ) sources to the original candidate @xmath23 distribution ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with no optical magnitude limit imposed , we estimate we have lost @xmath97 of candidates due to this optical cut . a majority of these missed candidates ( with @xmath98 ) have @xmath99 colors @xmath100 .",
    "however , the _ spectrally_-observed @xmath99 distribution ( figure  [ classhistobmk ] ) shows that we are not completely biased against identifying the reddest sources . when compared to the colors of optically selected qsos , the 2mass agn have a tail extending to moderately redder colors ( see figure  [ classjkvsbk ] and section 5.2 for more details ) .",
    "all spectra were initially classified using the semi - automated 6dfgs classification software , whose primary purpose was to determine accurate redshifts .",
    "this is a modified version of the runz software used for the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "it used 13 spectral templates to identify spectra using line - fitting and cross - correlation techniques .",
    "this program produced very reliable redshifts for all galaxies in general , although was less reliable at separating out the various agn classes from late and early type galaxies , and stars .",
    "all spectra were visually inspected to determine whether a poor - quality spectrum flagged by the 6dfgs software was worthy of further examination .",
    "432 spectra were of sufficient quality to enable a classification of some sort , but not necessarily an unambiguous identification .",
    "all spectra were shifted to their rest - frame using redshifts determined by the 6dfgs program .",
    "we assembled a database of emission - line diagnostics for all the good quality spectra to assist with the identifications .",
    "the diagnostics included line fluxes , equivalent widths ( ews ) , and dispersion velocities .",
    "these were estimated by fitting voigt profiles and the underlying continua were approximated by linearly interpolating straight - line fits on either side of each line .",
    "line fluxes were then determined by integrating the flux in the fitted profiles above the continuum level .",
    "dispersion velocities were determined from the fwhm of the lines .",
    "the lines of interest and the effective wavelength regions used to define the continuum and line integration limits are shown in table  [ lines ] .",
    "the _ fitprofs _ task in iraf was used for the automated measurement of line diagnostics .",
    "this included the ability to deblend closely separated lines , e.g. , h@xmath101 and [ n ii ] .",
    "an important input parameter for the _ fitprofs _ task is an estimate of the 1-sigma uncertainty per pixel .",
    "this allows the program to compute uncertainties in each of the fitted line parameters .",
    "since the fitting was non - linear , this was accomplished using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the spectral uncertainty was computed by first selecting a relatively clean region in the rest frame common to each spectrum , i.e. , devoid of strong emission and absorption lines .",
    "we selected the rest wavelength range 50505400 .",
    "we then fitted a straight line to the data in this region using a robust ( outlier - resistant ) regression method based on the general concept of `` m - estimation '' @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty was then estimated using the median absolute deviation in the residuals from the fit , and is also robust against potential outliers : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the value of the @xmath104 pixel in the 1-d spectrum and @xmath105 is the fitted value .",
    "this quantity is scaled such that it converges to the standard - deviation of a gaussian in the limit of a large sample . for spectra",
    "where the range 50505400   included or fell outside the long wavelength end ( @xmath106 ) after shifting to the rest frame , a wavelength range of @xmath107   was used instead . in all cases ,",
    "this ensured @xmath108 pixels for the noise computation .",
    "we estimated the smallest ew we are sensitive to by examining the dispersion in h@xmath101 and h@xmath109 ews of all the galaxies ( and potential agn ) with the best quality spectra ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "figure  [ classhistohbha_ew ] shows these distributions .",
    "ew measurements clustered around zero are lineless galaxies where an identification would be highly unreliable , if at all possible .",
    "we find we should be sensitive to galaxies with rest frame ew in either h@xmath101 or h@xmath109 of @xmath110 .",
    "given our observed wavelength range , either of these lines are expected to be observed at @xmath42 and therefore were used as constraints in the identification process below .",
    "line fluxes and ews were also measured interactively by integrating the line fluxes directly from the 1-d spectra .",
    "these were in excellent agreement , to within measurement error , with the profile - derived fluxes from above .",
    "all lines were visually inspected and unreliable flux measurements flagged .",
    "these were primarily lines that were contaminated by a strong sky line or atmospheric absorption band .",
    "our final emission line database retained lines with fluxes @xmath111 , and lines that were clearly discernable by eye in case our automated measurement of @xmath34 was overestimated .",
    "unreliable @xmath34 estimates occured in @xmath112 of the spectra .",
    "note that we did not correct the emission line fluxes for any underlying absorption ( e.g. , from stellar photospheres ) since a study using similar spectra from 2df by @xcite found this effect to be negligible .    a first pass examination of the spectra together with initial classifications provided by the 6dfgs program motivated us to define six broad object classes : type 1 agn ; type 2 agn ; starburst or late - type star forming galaxies ; early type galaxies ; stars ; and unknown emission line galaxies .",
    "these classes and the criteria used to identify them are as follows .",
    "spectra with broad h@xmath101 and/or h@xmath109 emission lines exceeding 1000 @xmath113 ( fwhm ) , or with other broad permitted lines present , e.g. , c iii ] or mg ii for @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , were classified as type 1 agn .",
    "included in this criterion are @xmath116 on the fwhm measurement and a h@xmath101 or h@xmath109 ew @xmath117 .",
    "spectra in which known broad lines could be discerned by eye but were relatively noisy , i.e. , with flux @xmath118 were classfied as `` probable '' type 1 agn .    non - type 1 agn spectra were classified using line ratios involving good measurements in either of the following line pairs : ( [ o iii ] , h@xmath109 ) or ( [ nii ] , h@xmath101 ) or ( [ sii ] , h@xmath101 ) or ( [ o iii ] , [ o ii ] ) .",
    "we first attempted a classification using the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite , which are based on the classic bpt diagrams of @xcite .",
    "figures  [ classniiflxratio ] and  [ classsiiflxratio ] show the traditional line - ratio diagrams using our good quality spectra ( with pre - classified type 1 agn removed ) and where _ all _ four lines had flux @xmath119 .",
    "unfortunately , all four lines in either figure  [ classniiflxratio ] or  [ classsiiflxratio ] were only simultaneously visible ( and with good @xmath77 ) in @xmath1208% ( 23/296 ) of the good - quality non - type 1 spectra .",
    "furthermore , the errors in the line ratios ( @xmath1200.2 dex , 1-@xmath34 ) were too large for the bulk of these spectra to be reliably classified .",
    "we therefore declared the few type 2 agn and star - forming galaxies that could be classified using this method ( at distances @xmath121 1-@xmath34 from the classification boundaries ) to be probable identifications .",
    "for the remaining 273 sources with good quality data and where only one of the above line pairs was available ( predominately when @xmath122 ) , a galaxy was classified as a `` probable '' type 2 agn if either of the following was satisfied : log([o iii]/h@xmath123 or log([n ii]/h@xmath124 or log([s ii]/h@xmath125 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or log([o iii]/[o ii ] ) @xmath126 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is possible that a significant fraction of our fainter targets at @xmath139 ( e.g. , figure  [ classhistok ] ) where a spectral identification could not be secured are type 1 agn .",

    "the agn fraction is still relatively high . for comparison , @xcite find that @xmath150 of @xmath315,200 sdss - detected galaxies at @xmath149 harbor agn ( mostly seyferts ) . an earlier study by @xcite found agn ( including liners ) in @xmath151 of a sample of 2399 nearby blue - selected galaxies .",
    "these studies are not a fair comparison since the galaxies were optically selected .",
    "it would be of interest to determine the fraction of sdss galaxies with active nuclei for a color cut of @xmath0 .",
    "we have a significantly higher agn identification rate than any previous low redshift galaxy sample .",
    "this is expected to be due to our red @xmath30 color selection .",
    "the @xcite survey of 2mass agn had a bluer color cut , @xmath26 , and had a significantly lower agn fraction ( see section 4.2 and table  [ summ ] ) .",
    "evidence for ( low - luminosity ) agn activity was recently found in @xmath152 of a sample of 64 late - type spiral galaxies by @xcite using x - ray data from _ chandra_. @xcite and @xcite also showed that the 2mass red agn are generally weak x - ray emitters , with the reddest @xmath30 sources being the weakest .",
    "agn down to low luminosities are therefore more common than previously thought .",
    "another consideration is that the 6df fiber diameter corresponds to sampling physical scales of @xmath153 kpc @xmath75 at @xmath154 .",
    "this means the 6df spectra are sampling light from entire galaxies , even at the lowest redshifts .",
    "furthermore , we are only sensitive to agn with h@xmath101 or h@xmath109",

    "@xcite showed that we are likely to miss many agn at this ew limit within our large aperture .",
    "from spectral observations of the nuclear regions ( @xmath155 pc ) of a large sample of blue - selected nearby galaxies , they found that almost 50% contain active nuclei .",
    "even though galaxy light can significantly dilute the contribution from an agn , we find that a near - ir selected sample with a red color cut can reduce the fraction of objects whose seds are dominated by host galaxy light , contrary to the claim of @xcite .",
    "our redshift distribution is consistent with that from @xcite who used a similar @xmath30 color cut .",
    "they detected 2 qsos with @xmath156 , consistent with an enhancement of the @xmath23 band flux from h@xmath101 emission moving into that band .",
    "figure  [ classhistoz ] ( right ) shows @xmath92 versus redshift for our agn and sdss qsos .",
    "this shows that our red near - ir color criterion biases agn selection towards low - redshifts because of the @xmath37-correction effect of the agn / qso sed .",
    "most agn show a sharp rise in flux in the rest - frame between 1 and 2@xmath157 m , possibly from hot dust emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this is redshifted out of the @xmath23 band at @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath92 colors of sdss qsos and the prediction for radio - quiet qsos from the template of @xcite confirm this trend .",
    "@xcite showed that 2mass has the sensitivity to detect qsos with @xmath159 out to @xmath160 , maybe higher ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) , although they are very rare .",
    "figure  [ classkvsz ] compares the @xmath23 flux and luminosity between active and inactive galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "we assumed a power - law sed @xmath161 for the @xmath37-correction .",
    "the slope @xmath101 was derived from the @xmath30 color of each source .",
    "no foreground redenning correction was applied since the extinction is typically @xmath162 mag for galactic latitudes @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ classkvsz ] ( right ) shows that the near - infrared luminosities of some of our active galaxies are comparable to those of securely identified inactive galaxies .",
    "these are a mixture of early - type and late - type starburst galaxies and their near - ir emission is dominated by the less - luminous host galaxy .",
    "our agn have a tail extending to higher luminosities ( by @xmath164 mag ) than the inactive galaxies .",
    "this trend has been found by many authors at other wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , host galaxy emission could be non - negligible in the type 2 agn , suggesting they would be slightly less - luminous than the type 1s .",
    "this luminosity dependence is consistent with the observation that the fraction of type 1 agn in our sample increases with redshift relative to inactive galaxies and there is a dearth of type 2 agn at @xmath165 . for comparison ,",
    "the bulk of the type 1 agn extend to @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath23 luminosities of our 2mass agn generally overlap with those of sdss qsos in the same redshift range , but the bulk at @xmath166 are more luminous on average than the locus formed by the sdss qsos ( figure  [ classkvsz ] - _ right _ ) .",
    "our agn therefore have luminosities closer to qsos than seyferts , although we caution that the sdss qsos and 2mass agn were selected using entirely different techniques .",
    "figure  [ classkvsz ] ( _ left _ ) shows that our agn have a @xmath23 flux limit ( @xmath167 ) brighter by @xmath168 mag than the bulk of sdss qsos at similar redshifts .",
    "a large fraction of the sdss qsos at @xmath169 are detected to fainter @xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "the lower number of 2mass agn at @xmath170 is due to the higher incompleteness in spectral identifications at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "we are therefore sensitive to the most near - ir luminous objects of the optically selected qso population .",
    "the ratio of type 1 to type 2 agn in our sample is @xmath171 .",
    "this ratio can not be compared to studies at other wavelengths due to the high level of incompleteness in our sample , e.g. , brought about by the relatively bright optical cut imposed by spectroscopy ( see section 3 ) .",
    "however , compared to previous 2mass agn studies that performed follow - up spectroscopy to similar optical limits , there is tentative evidence that the type 1 to type 2 ratio depends on @xmath30 color in the sense that a redder color cut has a higher proportion of type 1s .",
    "for example , @xcite find ratios of 14:23 and 4:0 for @xmath26 and @xmath172 respectively , and @xcite found @xmath173 for @xmath0 ( table  [ summ ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath171 for an effective @xmath174 .",
    "all these studies follow the same qualitative trend and can not be explained by redshift or luminosity dependent biases .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that most type 2 agn ( e.g. , seyferts 2s ) have their optical - to - near - ir emission dominated by `` blue '' host galaxy light , and that a red @xmath30 cut will select more sources where the active nuclear emission dominates , i.e. , type 1 agn and qsos at moderately low redshift .",
    "figure  [ classjkvsbk ] compares the optical - to - near - ir colors of 2mass red agn to those of sdss qsos .",
    "the sdss optical magnitudes were converted to equivalent ukst photographic @xmath58 , @xmath59 magnitudes by first converting them to cousins @xmath175 , @xmath176 using the color corrections in @xcite , and then to ukst magnitudes ( on the vega system ) using the corrections in @xcite .",
    "overall , the type 1 agn span a range in @xmath177 and @xmath61 color similar to those of optically - selected sdss qsos at the same @xmath92 color cut .",
    "this is not surprising since our sample required a relatively bright optical magnitude cut for reliable follow - up spectroscopy ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we could indeed be sampling the same agn population detected in the optical and spanning the same ( low ) redshift range ( figure  [ classhistoz ] - _ right _ ) .",
    "interestingly , the spread in @xmath177 and @xmath178 of the 2mass red agn are also consistent with the radio - loud quasar selected samples of @xcite and @xcite , although these samples spanned a large range in redshift and very few sources were detected in all 2mass bands .",
    "the type 2 agn have redder optical colors than the bulk spanned by type 1s ( figure  [ classjkvsbk ] - _ right _ ) where @xmath179 mag .",
    "this is consistent with the agn unified model where our view to the nuclear region is completely obscured and red host galaxy light will dominate the continuum flux at all wavelengths .",
    "the starlight can be instrinsically red ( e.g. , evolved stars ) , reddened by dust , or both .",
    "the type 1 agn have bluer optical colours , consistent with the sdss qsos .",
    "the optical properties of 2mass red type 1 agn are therefore not dramatically different from those in optically selected samples .",
    "our spectral observations are not sufficiently spectrophotometric to warrant use of emission line ratios to constrain the amount of dust reddening",
    ". however , the distribution of optical and near - ir colors does not exclude mild amounts of dust reddening .",
    "figure  [ classjkvsbk ] shows reddening vectors for dust with an optical depth @xmath180 applied to the colors of a typical blue qso in the rest frame ( @xmath181 ) and as observed at the median redshift of our type 1 agn ( @xmath182 ) . in order for a `` blue '' qso to be promoted to the region of color space occupied by the 2mass red type 1 agn",
    ", we require extinctions of @xmath183 mag .",
    "note that there is evidence that the color - color locus occupied by the sdss qsos may already be extended by dust reddenning with @xmath184 mag @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared to qsos discovered in earlier optical / uv surveys that used more rigid selection criteria .",
    "for example , the lbqs @xcite spans @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , considerably bluer than the sdss qsos .",
    "using the lbqs as an unreddened comparison sample would make the 2mass agn colors more difficult to reconcile with a simple screen extinction model with @xmath180 .",
    "most the 2mass agn are too blue in their optical colors for dust to be wholly responsible for modifying their optical / near - ir continua relative to blue - selected qsos .    however , there is some evidence that at least some 2mass agn are reddened by dust .",
    "the seds for a sample of 10 very red 2mass agn with @xmath0 , @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) were modeled by @xcite .",
    "they found that all sources were consistent with moderate amounts of dust redenning of @xmath190 mag .",
    "they also found that the mid - ir seds are dominated by hot dust and that their 60/12@xmath157 m luminosity ratios are significantly higher than those of blue - selected palomar - green ( pg ) qsos @xcite , suggesting a higher level of star - formation .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite , including evidence that in a handful of highly polarized objects , the optical has a contribution from agn light scattered by dust .",
    "we repeated a similar analysis as in @xcite to determine whether our 2mass red agn have a significantly higher far - ir emission on average . a search through the _",
    "spitzer _ and _ iso _ archives turned up no mid - to - far ir data .",
    "however , eight type 1 agn were securely detected by _",
    "iras _ in all bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath157 m ) .",
    "one of these ( 2mass j04225656 - 1854422 ) was previously identified as a serfert 1 galaxy , another with an ultra - luminous ir galaxy that was also detected in the rass ( 2mass j02460800 - 1132367 ) , and the remainder are given a `` galaxy '' classification in ned .",
    "the eight iras all - band - detected agn span redshifts @xmath191 and are at the red end of the @xmath177 color distribution with @xmath192 .",
    "photometry was extracted from the _ iras _ faint source catalog v2.0 using the ipac infrared science archive .",
    "in fact , only 10% of our 2mass agn ( both type 1 and 2 ) were detected in at least one band by _ iras _ , indicating the 2mass red agn are not predominately associated with the ultraluminous ir qsos found by @xcite .",

    "* ) , i.e. , independent of dust extinction and star formation rate . the rest - frame 12@xmath157 m flux density was estimated by linearly interpolating between the @xmath195 and @xmath196 wavelengths in the rest frame .",
    "figure  [ classseds ] also shows the spread ( 25@xmath72 - 75@xmath72 percentile range ) observed for optically selected pg qsos .",
    "these lines are directly from @xcite .",
    "the 2mass red agn all have higher normalized rest - frame far - ir emission at @xmath197 m than the pg qsos ( at @xmath198 significance ) .",
    "three 2mass agn also have higher emission at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath199m@xmath200 m .",
    "this indicates the far - ir emission in at least a handful of 2mass agn is dominated by heated dust , either due to star formation , the central agn or both .",
    "this same dust could contribute to redenning of their optical - to - near - ir continua .",
    "it s important to note that the 2mass agn with far - ir measurements are at the tail of distribution , i.e. , just those with _ iras _",
    "detections , and their ir seds are not necessarily representative of 2mass agn in general .",
    "figure  [ classbkvsew ] shows @xmath177 color as a function of equivalent width of the broad ( permitted ) emission line , h@xmath109 , and the narrow ( forbidden ) emission line , [ o iii ] ( @xmath201 5008 ) .",
    "traditionally , the broad emission lines are thought to originate from photoionized gas close to the central agn known as the broad line region ( blr ) , and the narrow lines from much further out , to a few hundred parsecs or more , known as the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",

    "however , there is a clear separation in these ews between our type 1 and 2 agn and this is consistent with the agn unified model .",
    "the h@xmath109 line in most of the type 2 agn appears intrinsically weaker than that in type 1s .",
    "this is because fewer ionizing photons are reaching and being reprocessed by the nlr , e.g. , due to absorption and scattering by dust . in type 1s",
    ", we have a direct view of the blr line emission .",
    "emission from the nlr can also contribute to the observed h@xmath109 line flux in type 1s .",
    "the type 2 agn also appear to be redder on average in @xmath177 than the type 1s .",
    "this is also consistent with the unified model if the continuum flux in type 2s suffers more extinction from dust , or if obscuration of the central agn allows us to see more contribution from a `` redder '' host galaxy , e.g. , from old stellar populations .",
    "the behavior in the ew of the narrow [ o iii ] emission line ( figure  [ classbkvsew ] - _ right _ ) for type 1 and 2 agn is reversed . here ,",
    "the [ o iii ] emission from type 1s is reduced relative to the optical continuum because the latter is stronger ( e.g. , less extincted by dust ) than that in type 2s .",
    "this is consistent with the difference in @xmath177 color between the type 1 and 2 agn being due to dust redenning .",
    "interestingly , @xmath177 color is weakly but significantly correlated with [ o iii ] ew for each of the type 1 and type 2 classes .",
    "pearson s product - moment correlation coefficient is 0.29 and 0.32 for the type 1s and type 2s respectively , with probabilities of @xmath2020.1% and @xmath2020.8% of these measures occuring by chance .",
    "similar results are obtained using kendall s non - parametric @xmath203 test .",
    "these results suggest anisotropic obscuration of the central agn and blr , and the bulk of the narrow - line emission originates from beyond the obscuring material .",
    "the type 2 agn in particular require contamination by non - agn light ( e.g. , galaxy hosts ) if the agn continuum source is obscured .",
    "otherwise their [ o iii ] ews will be much larger than observed .",
    "scattered agn light can not account for the additional continuum since it is expected to be less than a few percent in these objects @xcite .",
    "also , the overlap in ews between our type 1 agn and optically selected qsos implies host - galaxy contamination to their optical continuum emission is minimal .",
    "we have extended the 2mass red agn search to the southern equatorial sky and increased the statistical base of red agn by @xmath204 relative to previous surveys ( primarily from * ? ? ?",

    "4 .   comparing our ratio of type 1 to type 2 agn to that found in previous studies of 2mass red agn , there is tentative evidence that this ratio increases with a redder @xmath92 color cut .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that most type 2 agn have their optical - to - near - ir emission dominated by blue galaxy light , and that a redder @xmath92 cut will select more sources where the active nuclear emission dominates , i.e. , type 1 agn .",

    "the distribution of h@xmath109 and [ o iii ] equivalent widths , and optical / near - ir colors for type 1 and 2 agn are consistent with agn unified models .",
    "the equivalent width of the [ o iii ] emission line correlates with @xmath177 color in both types of agn , suggesting anisotropic obscuration of the central agn .",
    "the type 2 agn require a significant contribution to their optical continua by stellar light to satisfy the equivement width measurements .",
    "overall , the optical properties of the 2mass red agn are not dramatically different from those found in optical qso samples .",

    "<S> a small fraction of the type 1 agn could have their optical colors reddened by optically thin dust with @xmath7 mag relative to optically selected qsos . a handful show evidence for excess far - ir emission . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width ( ew ) and color distributions of the type 1 and 2 agn are consistent with agn unified models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ew of the [ o iii ] emission line weakly correlates with optical  near - ir color in each class of agn , suggesting anisotropic obscuration of the agn continuum . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the optical properties of the 2mass red agn are not dramatically different from those of optically - selected qsos . </S>",
    "<S> our near - ir selection appears to detect the most near - ir luminous qsos in the local universe to @xmath8 and provides incentive to extend the search to deeper near - ir surveys . </S>"
