    "supergiants are the descendants of massive o and b - type main sequence stars .",
    "when a massive star completes its main sequence evolution , it evolves rapidly across the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram becoming a cool supergiant , characterized by a helium - burning core , and a deep convective hydrogen - burning envelope .",
    "this is in strong contrast to their ob main sequence phase , where they are characterized by a convective hydrogen - burning core and a radiative envelope ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent evolution of the most massive stars ( initial mass @xmath7@xmath8 ) involves the ejection of their envelope in the wolf - rayet phase and a dramatic explosion in a type ib supernova , while the less massive stars ( initial mass between about 8 and 25@xmath8 ) evolve into red supergiants that explode as type ii supernovae .",
    "ultimately , the end product is a neutron star or black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to their extended radii , low atmospheric densities , slow rotation and long convective turnover times , supergiants provide an opportunity to study stellar magnetism and activity at the extremes of parameter space .",
    "observations of late - type supergiants ( spectral type f and later ) report an array of diverse and puzzling activity phenomena .",
    "active late - type supergiants are luminous in x - rays and show emission in chromospheric ultraviolet ( uv ) si  iv lines , with some stars showing evidence of flaring - phenomena associated with the presence of a corona and magnetic reconnection , presumably resulting from a dynamo - driven magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , unlike main sequence dwarfs , supergiants show little , if any , rotation - activity relation and are x - ray deficient by an order of magnitude or more compared to main sequence dwarf stars of similar spectral type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there also exists a class of  non - coronal \" or inactive supergiants that exhibit weak or no x - ray emission , uv spectra containing mostly low - temperature chromospheric lines ( o  i , mg  ii : @xmath9k ) and much weaker uv fluxes in c  iv chromospheric emission lines @xcite .",
    "the position of these non - coronal stars on the hr diagram coincides with the regions where cool ( t@xmath10k ) winds are predicted to dominate the circumstellar environment , potentially masking their x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible explanation for their apparent lack of activity is that magnetic loops might be submerged within the thick extended chromosphere @xcite , resulting in internal absorption of coronal x - rays .",
    "curiously , there also exist some  hybrid \" stars that show the strong c  iv uv line emission of active supergiants , but that are weak or undetected in x - rays ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "observations of the m2 supergiant betelgeuse ( @xmath11@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed a chromosphere extending beyond 120 r@xmath12 , as well as evidence of irregular surface brightness fluctuations , which simulations suggest are due to giant convective cells @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite predict that these convective regions are able to excite a dynamo capable of generating a highly structured surface magnetic field with localised features as strong as 500 g .",
    "in fact , @xcite recently reported the detection of a magnetic field in this star , with a ( disc - integrated ) longitudinal field component varying from about 0.5 - 1.5 g over about one month .    motivated by the outstanding puzzles associated with the activity of late - type supergiants , the near complete lack of direct constraints on their magnetic fields , and recent successes measuring the magnetic fields of red and yellow giants ( evolved intermediate - mass stars ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have initiated a program to search for direct evidence of magnetic fields in supergiants ( evolved high - mass stars ) .",
    "the data presented in this paper represent stars with detected zeeman signatures observed as part of a large survey of over 30 supergiants ranging in spectral type from early a- to late m.",
    "circular polarisation ( stokes  @xmath2 ) spectra were obtained with the espadons spectropolarimeter , mounted on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , as part of a larger survey investigating the magnetic properties of bright , late - type supergiants . in addition , one spectrum was acquired with the narval spetropolarimeter on the bernard lyot telescope ( tbl ) .",
    "both the espadons and narval instruments are optical echelle spectropolarimeters , capable of yielding broad bandpass ( 370 to 1050 nm ) , high resolution ( @xmath13 ) , polarised spectra .",
    "a complete polarisation observation consists of four individual sub - exposures between which the half - wave retarders are rotated back and forth between position angles of -90@xmath14 and + 90@xmath14 in order to reduce first - order systematic errors in the polarisation analysis .",
    "the extraction of the espadons and narval spectra , along with wavelength calibration and continuum normalisation , was accomplished using the upena pipeline running libre - esprit @xcite , a dedicated automatic reduction package installed at both cfht and tbl . to avoid saturation",
    ", we often obtained multiple consecutive sequences of observations of a target that we co - added after extraction . the median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the co - added observations ( computed from photon counting statistics , per 1.8 kms@xmath15 spectral pixel in the @xmath2-band ) was about 2500 , but ranged as high as 4700 .",
    "more than 30 stars have been observed as part of a survey of the brightest supergiants .",
    "the current sample contains 4 a - type stars , 8 f - type stars , 11 g - type stars , 7 k - type stars , and 3 m - type stars . in this paper",
    "we report the current results of this survey , with a focus on the 9 stars in which clear stokes  @xmath2 zeeman signatures have been detected .",

    "[ obs_tab ]",
    "in order to increase the s / n and detect weak zeeman signatures in the circularly polarized spectra , we applied the least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ; * ? ? ? * ) procedure to all polarimetric observations .",
    "the line masks used in this analysis were constructed for photospheric lines using atomic data from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with line depths computed assuming solar abundances and lte .",
    "only lines with predicted depths greater than 10 percent of the continuum flux were included in the line masks .",
    "this resulted in , for example , about 4000 lines included in the mask for a g2 star .",
    "the final result of the lsd analysis of a sequence of observations is a single , mean circular polarisation profile ( lsd stokes  @xmath2 ) , a mean diagnostic null profile ( lsd @xmath17 ) , and a mean un - polarized profile ( lsd stokes  @xmath18 ) .",
    "this resulted in an increase in the s / n by a factor of 21 to 68 , roughly varying as the square root of the number of lines in the mask .",
    "all lsd profiles were produced on a spectral grid with a velocity bin of 1.8  kms@xmath15 .",
    "[ hr_diag ] illustrates the lsd profiles of 9 stars of our sample for which magnetic fields were unambiguously detected , showing the often complex zeeman signatures across the spectral lines of supergiants from early - f to mid - k spectral type and their placement on the hr diagram .",
    "temperatures and luminosities were compiled from various published catalogues @xcite , or otherwise derived using @xmath19 photometry from the bright star catalogue @xcite using transformations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "six additional stars in which no statistically significant zeeman detection is achieved but in which the presence of magnetic field is suspected ( based on an excess of stokes  @xmath2 signal at the position of the stellar mean spectral line ) are shown in fig .  [ grid1 ] .",
    "finally , the remaining stars presenting no evidence of a zeeman signature are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ grid2 ] .",
    "the longitudinal field measurements reported in table  [ obs_tab ] were measured from the lsd stokes  @xmath18 and @xmath2 profiles in the manner described by @xcite , with the integration carried out within the limits of the stokes  @xmath18 line profile .",
    "we stress that while the longitudinal field provides a useful measure of the line - of - sight component of the field , we do not use it as the primary diagnostic of the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is because a large variety of magnetic configurations can produce a null longitudinal field ( as is apparent from our measurements in table  [ obs_tab ] ) , while many of these configurations will generate a detectable stokes  @xmath2 signature in the velocity - resolved line profiles that we observed , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ hr_diag ] .",
    "we find an increase in the number of detectable stokes  @xmath2 signatures for observations of higher s / n ( the peak s / n of the unpolarized spectra in the @xmath2-band ranges from 700 to 3300 ) .",
    "we find only 4 detections ( @xmath2040 percent of our detected number of stars ) with peak s / n of 2500 or less ( the bottom half of our sample ) , while we find 5 detections ( @xmath2060 percent of our detected number of stars ) with peak s / n in the top half of our sample .",
    "however , we do detect fields in stars with lower s / n , the lowest being @xmath21  per with a peak s / n of 1509 in the @xmath2-band . nevertheless , based on our own experience and that of @xcite",
    "it appears that achieving a s / n of 2500 or higher is best suited to detecting and characterising magnetic fields in supergiants using the methods described here .",
    "our investigation of late - type supergiants shows that many host detectable stokes  @xmath2 zeeman signatures .",
    "the signatures are frequently complex , and the associated longitudinal magnetic field are generally weaker than 1  g. we have detected usually unambiguous zeeman signatures in 9 stars of our sample , with 6 additional stars suspected to show signatures .",
    "the detected stars span a large range of physical characteristics , with the most massive star detected being @xmath21  lep ( f0ib , @xmath2015@xmath8 ) .",
    "this star also represents the hottest star in our sample with a detectable circular polarisation zeeman signature ( @xmath22k ) .",
    "the lowest mass star in our sample with a detectable zeeman signature is @xmath5  dra ( g2iab , @xmath205@xmath8 ) .",
    "based on our adopted effective temperatures , the coolest star with a detection is @xmath23  pup ( @xmath24k ) , but we also have obtained detections in other cool k - type stars such as @xmath25  vel .    as is evident from the hr diagram in fig .",
    "[ hr_diag ] , we obtain a high incidence fraction for stars with spectral types f ( @xmath2040 percent ; total of 8 stars observed ) , g ( @xmath2030 percent ; total of 11 stars observed ) , and k ( @xmath2040 percent ; total of 7 stars observed ) . for m - type supergiants",
    "this fraction is more uncertain ( with a total of just 3 stars observed ) ; with two suspected detections the incidence fraction may be as high 67 percent .",
    "we currently have not obtained any detections in hotter a - type stars ( total of 4 stars observed ) .",
    "prior to november 2009 , espadons was known to suffer from ( variable ) polarisation cross - talk at a level of 1 - 4 percent . during the period when most of the observations described here were acquired ,",
    "the primary source of this cross - talk was the espadons atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ; * ? ? ? * ) . in november 2009",
    ", a new adc was installed in front of the espadons polarimetric module , and the measured cross - talk since that time has remained stable at a level of about 0.6 percent .",
    "the repeatability of our zeeman detections ( both with espadons , before and after resolution of the cross - talk issue , as well as with narval ) , the existence of both detections and non - detections within our sample , the diversity and complexity of the detected signatures , and the lack of any published evidence for strong , coherent linear polarisation within the metallic absorption lines of late - type supergiants , makes us confident that the stokes  @xmath2 signatures detected within this survey are not significantly affected by cross - talk .",
    "our current dataset reveals no clear differences between the classical optical activity indicators ( such as ca  ii h&k emission or h@xmath21 emission ) of those stars for which we detect fields and those for which we do not .",
    "additionally , we find no obvious differences between the rotational velocities of the stars with magnetic detections and those without ( using @xmath26 measurements of @xcite ) .",
    "however , there does appear to be a weak correlation between the unsigned longitudinal field strength and ca  ii core equivalent width measurements for some stars in which fields are detected on multiple dates , such as @xmath5  dra and @xmath6  gem ( this correlation for @xmath5  dra is shown in fig .",

    ". essentially , our direct detections of magnetic fields in supergiants - in particular our typical observation of sub-1 g longitudinal fields - are not consistent with any of the reports claimed in those papers .",
    "a few of the stars in our sample were previously investigated for magnetic fields .",
    "several previous magnetic analyses of @xmath21  per were unable to detect a significant field , with the lowest uncertainty that of @xcite with @xmath27 g and another measurement by @xcite ( @xmath28 g ) . our 5 observations of this star span almost a full year , show some variability ( see fig .",
    "[ hd20902_var ] ) and confirm the presence of a weak longitudinal field ( @xmath29  g ) . while this field is weak , this star exhibits the strongest and most complex stokes  @xmath2 profile of all observed stars , with an amplitude larger by a factor of @xmath202 .",

    "the signatures are sometimes complex and correspond to longitudinal magnetic fields generally below 1 g .",
    "these characteristics suggest topologically complex magnetic fields , presumably generated by dynamo action . given the high rate of incidence , it may well be that magnetic fields are excited in all cool supergiants .",
    "nevertheless , our failure to detect fields in some stars for which very high s / n observations were acquired points to a large range of field strengths or complexities .",
