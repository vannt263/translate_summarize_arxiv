    "single - layer quasi two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) such as those formed at the interface between two dissimilar semiconductors can be routinely driven to a many - body interaction regime by application of a strong magnetic field of several teslas perpendicular to the 2deg layer  @xcite . by increasing the magnetic field ,",
    "the 2deg first enters in the integer quantum hall regime , and then in the fractional quantum hall regime  @xcite .",
    "multilayer coupled 2deg s like trilayer systems offer much more possibilities for the theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite search of the involved physics , even at zero magnetic field .",
    "new single - particle effects like layer ( site ) energies , tunneling coupling between layers , and many - body effects as the inter - layer coulomb coupling should be included , with the two later effects being strongly dependent on the separation between layers .",
    "we provide in this work an exhaustive theoretical study of trilayer systems at zero - magnetic field , within the framework of a hartree - fock mean field approximation , already used for bilayer systems  @xcite , and also for a simplified version of the trilayer system considered here  @xcite .",
    "the model , schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , includes intra - layer and inter - layer ( hopping ) kinetic energies ( not considered in ref .",

    "an additional external parameter is the total density of the system : we will see that as the density decreases , the trilayer system is driven to a single - particle tunneling dominated regime .    by doing a numerical minimization of the total energy of the system over all the internal variables ,",
    "we have found a zero - temperature extremely rich phase - diagram for the possible ground - state configurations .",
    "these full numerical results may be qualitatively understood as resulting from the diverse scaling properties of the different energy contributions to the total energy of the system , with respect to the external variables like the total density or the distance between layers .",
    "interestingly , we have found that at zero magnetic field and for close enough layers the physics of the trilayer system becomes dominated by single - particle effects _ both _ in the high - density limit ( dominated by the intra - layer kinetic energy ) and in the low - density limit ( dominated by the hopping or tunneling and site energies ) .",
    "the interaction dominated regime is then restricted to intermediate densities ( exchange ) and large separations between layers ( hartree ) .",
    "the wide ground - state exploration in the available parameter space ( distance between layers , total electronic density , tunneling coupling ) provided in this work may serve as a qualitative guide for the design of experimental trilayer systems .",
    "the rest of the work is organized in the following way : in section ii we explain the model and introduce the variational hartree - fock method we use to obtain the expression for total energy of the system .",
    "analytical and numerical ground - states resulting from the minimization of the system total energy are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the conclusions . in the two appendices we discuss some limits and the physics beyond the inter - layer exchange energy contribution ( appendix a ) , and",
    "we explain how to model the hopping parameter dependence with the layer separation ( appendix b ) .",

    "other important difference is that we have assumed from the very outset that our semiconductor - based 2deg has translational invariance in the @xmath245 plane , an assumption that seems to be not justified in the case of the 2deg at oxide interfaces  @xcite .",
    "and lastly , all the evidence in this latter case points to the importance of correlation effects in describing their physics  @xcite , beyond the reach of our variational hf approximation , which on the other side is reasonable for the treatment of the weakly - correlated semiconductor systems discussed here .",
    "the possible ground - state configurations of a trilayer system have been determined , within the framework of a variational hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the metallic layers are coulomb coupled through the inter - layer hartree and exchange interactions , and also due to the tunneling between the neighboring layers . at high - density the system becomes quite simple , as the only remaining terms in the total energy in this regime are the intra - layer kinetic energy , and the hartree classical contribution .",
    "the low - density regime is dominated by two single - particle effects introduced in this work : the tunneling between layers and the site energies .",
