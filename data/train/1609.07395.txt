    "the failure of a transmission line in a power grid leads to a redistribution of power flows in the grid .",
    "this redistribution may cause overloads of other lines and their subsequent failures , leading to a major blackout in a large area @xcite .",
    "these failures may be initiated by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , hurricanes , and solar flares , as well as by terrorist and electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) attacks @xcite .",
    "recent blackouts , such as the 2003 and 2012 blackouts in the northeastern us and in india  @xcite , demonstrate that major power failure has a devastating impact on many aspects of modern life .",
    "hence , there is a dire need to study the properties of cascading failures in power grids .",
    "the studies of failures in power grids usually employ the direct current ( dc ) approximation of power flows @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ a simplified dc model of a power grid which is equivalent to a resistor network @xcite and follow the cascading failure model of @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the distribution of blackouts in power grids follows a power law , which is related to the phenomenon of self - organized criticality .",
    "other authors suggest that blackouts follow first - order phase transitions , in which the loss of power is either very small or very large @xcite . the goal of this paper is to create a realistic model of a power grid which mimics the us western interconnect ( uswi ) , to discover whether large blackouts can occur and to explore their distribution and spatial - temporal propagation , if they do occur . additionally , we study the dependency of blackout characteristics on power grid design .",
    "for this reason , we introduce a synthetic degree and distance attachment ( dada ) model @xcite .",
    "we show that the characteristics of blackouts are universal .",
    "however , the sizes of blackouts are much smaller in the uswi - like model with a realistic design than in an artificial dada model with a different spatial organization . in particular , we study how the size of the blackout and the dynamics of the cascading failures depend on a set of three parameters of the model which characterize the robustness of the grid : ( 1 ) tolerance @xmath0 of the lines to overload , compared to their initial loads @xcite ; ( 2 ) the minimum current @xmath3 which any line in the network can carry independent of its initial load ; and ( 3 ) the interval of currents of the transmission lines @xmath4 to @xmath5 , from which a line is randomly selected to initiate the cascading failures .",
    "we characterize @xmath3 and @xmath5 by dimensionless parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 : the level of protection , @xmath8 , and the significance of initial failure , @xmath9 , which are the fraction of the lines with transmitting currents less than @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we find that in a broad range of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , large blackouts with final demand less than 80% of the initial demand may occur with a significant probability both in the uswi - like grid and in artificially constructed dada grids .",
    "moreover , we find that in this range of parameters the distribution of yield is bimodal , which is consistent with first - order phase transitions .",
    "most importantly , we find that in each cascading failure which leads to a large blackout there is a latent period during which the damage is localized in space , few lines fail , and the decrease in yield is insignificant .",
    "the existence of this latent period suggests that the majority of blackouts can be effectively stopped by the timely intervention of grid operators .",
    "the length of the latent period increases as the tolerance @xmath0 increases .",
    "another important discovery is that in the event of a large blackout , cascading failures stop when the network breaks into small , disconnected islands .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : models ] we describe our methods of constructing power grids and simulating cascading failures . in section [ sec : westcoast ] we study the properties of the uswi model and its cascading failures .",
    "next , in section [ sec : prefmodel ] we describe the preferential degree and distance attachment ( dada ) model . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare the physical features and behavior of cascade simulations of the uswi model power grid and the dada model . finally , in section [",
    "sec : conc ] we discuss and summarize the results of our study .",
    "in this section , we describe the network , flow model , and cascade model in detail .",
    "we denote the set of all nodes as @xmath13 and the set of all lines as @xmath14 .",
    "thus , a connected network is defined as the ordered pair @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the power grid network by the graph @xmath16 consisting of @xmath17 transmitting , @xmath18 supply , and @xmath19 demand nodes .",
    "the total number of nodes is @xmath20 .",
    "each supply or demand node is specified by the amount of current it supplies ( @xmath21 ) or by the amount of current it demands ( @xmath22 ) . for transmitting nodes ,",
    "we assume @xmath23 . due to the law of charge conservation , @xmath24 .",
    "the network is specified by the @xmath25 symmetric resistance matrix with elements @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the resistance equivalent to the reactance value of the transmission line connecting nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if there is no direct transmission line connecting nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we assume that @xmath29 . since the matrix with elements @xmath26 is symmetric , the total number of transmitting lines @xmath30 is equal to the number of finite elements of the resistance matrix divided by two .",
    "each node @xmath27 is connected to @xmath31 nodes by transmission lines , where @xmath31 is the number of finite elements in the @xmath32 row of the resistance matrix .",
    "thus @xmath33 represents the degree of node @xmath27 and @xmath34 is the average degree of all nodes in the network .",
    "we denote the set of all neighbors of node @xmath27 as @xmath35 .",
    "we employ the simplified dc model of a power grid widely used in the engineering community .",
    "this model is equivalent to flow equations in resistor networks . in this model",
    "the powers flowing through each line are replaced by currents , the reactances of each line are represented by resistances , and the phase angles are replaced by voltages .",
    "each transmission line connecting nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 is characterized by its resistance @xmath26 , while each node @xmath27 is characterized by its voltage @xmath36 .",
    "the current @xmath37 flowing from node @xmath27 to node @xmath28 is @xmath38 additionally , the sum of all the currents flowing into each node @xmath27 is equal to the sum of all currents flowing out : @xmath39 where @xmath40 or @xmath41 if a node @xmath27 is a supply or a demand node respectively , and @xmath42 otherwise .",
    "the particular methods used to solve the system of equations ( [ eq : ohmslaw])-([eq : junctionrule ] ) can be found in appendix [ sec : makematrix ] .      once the system ( [ eq : ohmslaw])-([eq : junctionrule ] ) is solved , we find the currents in all transmitting lines @xmath37 and define their maximum capacities @xmath43 using the following two rules ( fig .

    "we usually use @xmath49 and vary @xmath0 as the main parameter of grid resilience . we introduce the standard capacity @xmath50 because it would be unrealistic to assume that lines are built with very low capacity .",
    "in fact , many lines in realistic power grids may be built for backup reasons , so initially @xmath51 . without standard load requirements",

    "this condition is called the @xmath78 property . for simplicity",
    ", this model does not have the @xmath78 property .",
    "however , removing a single line from a network without the @xmath78 property is the equivalent to removing two lines from a network with the @xmath78 property .",

    "the interesting feature of the yield histogram is its pronounced bimodality ( fig .",

    "[ subfig : pifuswi ] ) that the distribution of yield clearly remains bimodal for @xmath159 for the uswi model .",
    "similar behavior can be observed in the motter model and the mutual percolation model , where the collapse transition is shown to be a first - order transition ( all - or - nothing transition ) @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : metrics ] we defined large blackouts as having @xmath114 .",
    "the motivation behind this definition is that there is a gap in the cumulative distribution of the yield between @xmath163 and @xmath164 that separates severe cascades from mild ones .",

    ", the gap in the yield distribution reduces and eventually disappears for @xmath1 .",
    "the ensemble of cascades can be characterized by two important parameters of the outcome : ( i ) the probability of a large blackout @xmath167 , which we call the risk of a large blackout @xmath168 , and ( ii ) the average blackout yield @xmath169 , for the cases of large blackouts .",

    "we find that for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the shapes of the curves @xmath168 remain approximately constant , but the curves significantly shift in a horizontal direction .",

    "[ subfig : alpha0-p0.5 ] ) .",
    "this means that the higher the current of the initially failed line , the larger the tolerance necessary to achieve the same degree of protection for the transmission lines . in other words , the same effect can be achieved either by protecting a certain fraction of the most significant lines from spontaneous failure , or by increasing the tolerance of all the lines by some quantity ( fig .",

    "the increase in @xmath6 achieves a significant effect on the risk of large blackouts only when @xmath6 approaches @xmath175 .",

    "these metrics only weakly depend on @xmath7 , but are strongly increasing functions of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : b - uswi - u ] ) .",

    "the dependence of these metrics on @xmath6 is more complex ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : b - uswi - p ] ) .",
    "while the yield @xmath179 starts to increase only for @xmath180 , the number of survived lines @xmath181 significantly increases with @xmath6 even for small @xmath6 .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath6 is the level of protection of the lines , and fewer lines fail if more lines are protected . as @xmath6 approaches @xmath182 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath181 on @xmath0 becomes very weak .",
    "the explanation of this fact is based on the notion that @xmath183 is computed only for the case of _ large _ blackouts . for a large blackout to occur ,",
    "a significant fraction of lines must fail , sufficient to disconnect a large fraction of demand nodes .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath0 increases , the risk of a large blackout decreases to zero , so the average fraction of lines surviving for all the cascades ( large and small ) approaches 1 .    another important observation from fig .",
    "[ subfig : b - uswi - p ] is the very small dependence of @xmath178 on the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , as opposed to @xmath181 .",
    "hence , by removing a small fraction of the lines ( 20% ) the grid disintegrates into many small clusters , each less than 20% of the total size .",
    "indeed , percolation theory predicts that close to the percolation threshold , it is sufficient to delete an infinitesimally small fraction of the so called `` red '' bonds ( which form a fractal set with fractal dimension @xmath184 ) to divide the network into a set of small disconnected components @xcite .",
    "the cascading failures that do not result in large blackouts ( @xmath185 ) are usually short @xmath186 ( figs .",
    "[ subfig : tvsalph - uswi - p0.5 ] and [ subfig : tvsalph - uswi - u0.9 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the duration of cascades resulting in large blackouts @xmath112 increases with @xmath0 , reaching values of order 40 for large @xmath0 .",
    "this means that for large tolerances , it takes much longer for the blackout to spread over a large area , since at each time step only a few lines have a huge overload and fail .    in the cascades resulting in large blackouts ,",
    "the fraction of the consumed current , @xmath187 , decreases with time in a non - trivial way ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : y - uswi ] ) . during the first few time steps of the cascades , the yield does not significantly decrease since the current can successfully redistribute over the remaining lines without disconnection of the demand nodes .",
    "this period , in which the cascade is still localized and a blackout has not yet occurred , can be called the _ latent period of the cascade_. the recognition of this latent period is important since it is a period in which a cascade is beginning to spread but has not yet grown uncontrollable . in the latent period it may still be possible to intervene and redistribute current flow to stop the cascade before it becomes a large blackout .",
    "we define the duration of this latent period of the cascade as the time step at which the yield drops below 0.95 . at approximately this time",
    "step the yield starts to rapidly decrease and then , towards the end of the cascade , stabilizes again .",
    "the shape of this function is characteristic of an abrupt first - order transition observed in simpler models of network failure @xcite . remarkably , the duration of the latent period is a linear function of tolerance ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : alph-1-uswi ] ) .      to observe the spatial spread of the reduction of demand for each run , we group the grid s demand nodes into bins based on their `` hop distance '' from the original failed line .",

    "we average the local yield @xmath188 for runs resulting in large blackouts ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : currcons - uswi ] ) .",
    "the yield in each bin at the end of cascades resulting in large blackouts is almost independent of the distance from the initially failed line .",
    "while at the beginning of the cascade the blackout is localized near the initially failed line , eventually the blackout spreads uniformly over the entire system .",
    "delocalization occurs at the end of the latent period of the cascade .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the behavior of the blackout profiles , which start to rapidly drop down for large distances only at intermediate time steps of the cascade .    to give a more quantitative measure of the blackout spread",

    "the final local yield is almost independent of the distance from the initially failed line .",
    "in the previous section we find that cascading failures in the uswi model have characteristic features of a first - order transition : the bimodal distribution of yield and the latent period during which the damage to the network is insignificant .",
    "it is important to investigate whether these features are due to particular characteristics of the uswi design , or whether they are universal features of a much broader class of models .",
    "moreover , the data on real grids are limited and therefore it is important to develop algorithms for generating synthetic grids resembling known real grids .",
    "the two basic features of uswi that we would like to reproduce are the degree distribution and the distribution of line lengths .",

    "accordingly we use the barabsi - albert model as the basis of the synthetic model . in the original barabsi - albert model ,",
    "a newly created node is attached to an existing node with a probability proportional to the degree of this node .",
    "however , for power grids embedded in two - dimensional space , the length distribution of lines , resulting from the degree preferential attachment , would not decrease with the length .",
    "therefore , in order to create a grid with a decreasing length distribution , one must introduce a penalty for attaching to a distant node . here",

    "here we compare the main results from the uswi model and the dada model .",
    "we also discuss reasons for the differences observed .",
    "the cumulative distribution of currents in the dada model closely follows the exponential distribution of currents in the uswi grid ( fig .",
    "[ f : curr ] ) .",
    "this is important because the ratio of currents in the two models corresponding to the same significance of lines @xmath7 is approximately constant .",
    "the distribution of the yield @xmath111 in the dada model is also bimodal for approximately the same set of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 as in the uswi model , but the gap between the two modes is significantly wider in the dada model than in the uswi model ( fig .  [",
    "f : pif ] ) . figure  [ f : pif ] compares the yield distributions of the uswi and dada models for @xmath274 and @xmath49 for several values of @xmath275",
    ". both models always collapse ( @xmath114 ) for small values of @xmath0 , and survive ( @xmath185 ) for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "but for the dada values , chances of large blackout ( risk ) are smaller for the same set of parameters than in the uswi model . for example , the dada model can still survive with a small probability for @xmath276 , but the uswi always collapses for @xmath277 .",
    "conversely , we do not observe any large blackouts in the dada model for @xmath278 , while the uswi model can still have large blackouts even for @xmath279 .",
    "thus , even though in the event of a large blackout the average yield in the uswi is greater than in the dada model ( and thus , in this sense , the dada model is more vulnerable than the uswi model ) , the risk of large blackouts is greater in the uswi model than in the dada model for the same set of parameters .",
    "these differences may be related to the fractal structure of the uswi , in which densely populated areas with lot of demand and supply nodes are separated by large patches of empty land over which few long transmission lines are built , whereas the dada model has constant density of nodes .",
    "thus , it is less likely that the cascade will spread over the entire grid in the uswi model than in the dada model , but a higher tolerance is necessary to prevent large blackouts in the uswi model than in the dada model .",
    "qualitatively , the behaviors of the metrics @xmath179 , @xmath181 , and @xmath178 are similar in the uswi model and in the dada model , but in the dada model the survival quantities are always smaller for the same @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that , remarkably , the artificial dada model is more vulnerable than the uswi model based on actual data ( figs .",
    "[ f : risk ] , [ f : alpha0 ] , and [ f : gyl ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath280 in the dada model are very small , indicating that in the event of a large blackout the dada network disintegrates into very small connected components , each constituting about 1% of the nodes of the grid . in the uswi grid ,",
    "the average largest component is larger , because uswi grid consists of several dense areas connected by few long lines .",
    "the overload of these long lines breaks the uswi grid into relatively large disconnected components , preventing the cascade from further spreading .",
    "the spatial and temporal behaviors of the cascades in the dada model closely follow the behaviors in the uswi model ( figs .",
    "[ f : ncasc ] , [ f : latent ] , [ f : currbydist ] , and [ f : radgyrmod ] ) .",
    "@xmath190 in the dada model is much smaller than in the uswi model due to the different structures of the models and difference in diameters of the networks .",
    "the longest distance ( in terms of number of hops ) between any two nodes ( i.e. diameter of the network ) in the dada model is @xmath281 , while in the uswi model it is @xmath282 . in both models",
    "we see that the cascade spreads more quickly for smaller @xmath0 than for larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , the first - order all - or - nothing nature of the cascades , characterized by a latent period during which the blackout is small and localized followed by a fast blackout spread over a large area , is common in both models .",
    "the dada model has an advantage over the uswi model , that in the former we know the exact coordinates of the nodes and thus we can illustrate the spatial and temporal evolution of the blackout as a sequence of snapshots on the @xmath283 plane .",
    "[ f : grid ] shows spatial snapshots of the cascading failures taken at different time steps for the dada model with parameters @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "the color of a line indicates the time step of the cascade at which this line has failed .",
    "one can see that during first 3 time steps of the cascade ( red lines ) the area of line failures is small and localized near the initial failure .",
    "the cascade starts to spread during time steps 4 - 8 ( orange and yellow - green ) , but the area of line failures is still localized . at time step 10",
    "the cascade quickly spreads to very distant parts of the system ( green ) .",
    "the blue and violet lines are the final time steps of the cascade .",
    "thus , the figure suggests that there is a latent period of the cascade during which the area of line failures is small and localized .",
    "the dada model and the uswi model have many common features .",
    "the physical features , such as the distribution of degrees , resistances , and currents , compare well in both models .",
    "the behavior of the cascades of failures in the dada model is also similar to their behavior in the uswi model power grid , despite the differences in construction of these models .    the overloads and cascading failures in the uswi and dada models have features of all - or - nothing transition , just like in a broad spectrum of more primitive models such as the motter model @xcite . in the motter model , instead of currents ,",
    "the betweenness of each node in a graph is computed and the maximum load of each node is defined as its original betweenness multiplied by the tolerance . then , a random node is taken out , simulating an initial failure , and the new betweenness of each node is calculated .",
    "if the new betweenness of a node exceeds its maximum load , this node is taken out and the entire process is repeated .",
    "the yield in the motter model is defined as the fraction of survived nodes at the end of the cascade .",
    "the distribution of the yield in the motter model is bimodal for a large range of tolerances .",
    "similarly , in a wide range of parameters , both the dada model and the uswi power grid are in a metastable state and there exists the risk that the failure of a single line will lead to a large blackout , in which the yield falls below 80% .",
    "as tolerance increases beyond @xmath286 , the risk of a large blackout decreases almost to 0 .",
    "the level of line protection , @xmath6 , increases the robustness of the grid , but to a lesser extent than does the tolerance .",
    "an important parameter defining the robustness of the grid is the significance of the initial failure @xmath7 .",
    "the risk of a large blackout increases with @xmath7 in the same way as with tolerance . given a particular @xmath0 , when @xmath7 is small , there is practically no risk of a large blackout , while when @xmath7 approaches 1 , the risk is maximal for the given @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is kept constant and @xmath7 decreases , there is the same effect on the risk of a large blackout as when @xmath0 increases and @xmath7 is kept constant , meaning that the same effect could be achieved by protecting important lines as by increasing the overall tolerance . nevertheless , even if the initially failed lines are selected irrespective of their currents ( @xmath287 ) , the distribution of yields remains bimodal , but the probability of large blackouts significantly decreases .",
    "upon failure of a line , the first few cascade time steps affect only the immediate vicinity of the failed line .",
    "this is the latent period of the cascade , during which it may be feasible to intervene and redistribute the current flow and possibly prevent a large blackout from occurring . at some time step , the cascade may begin to spread quickly , and only then will a large blackout occur . in this case , the blackout radius increases rapidly with cascade time steps , but with a lower rate for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "once the failure has spread over the entire grid , the cascade continues to overload a small number of lines before terminating . at this time step",
    "the grid completely disintegrates into small disconnected clusters . during the first few time steps of the cascade , the demand does not significantly decrease , but starts to quickly drop at the end of the latent period .",
    "the duration of the latent period of the cascade linearly increases with the overall tolerance and provides sufficient time for grid operators to intervene and stop the cascade .",
    "similar phenomena were observed during the large blackout of august 14th 2003 .",
    "it is well documented @xcite that the power outage , which affected a large portion of the northeastern region of the usa on august 14th 2003 , was caused by line overloads due to a heat - wave .",
    "but what might have been a manageable local blackout cascaded into massive widespread distress on the electric power grid .",
    "power was not re - distributed after overloaded transmission lines hit unpruned foliage , and the spreading of blackout was exacerbated over a time period of 30 minutes .",
    "this example closely resembles the large blackout scenario predicted by our models .",
    "thus , our model provides useful understanding of general features of the cascades of failures in power grids , which may be used for increasing the resilience of power grids and designing optimal shedding strategies for preventing cascades from spreading .",

    "<S> using the linearized dc power flow model , we study cascading failures and their spatial and temporal properties in the us western interconnect ( uswi ) power grid . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the preferential degree and distance attachment ( dada ) model , with similar degree distributions , resistances , and currents to the uswi . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the behavior of both grids resulting from the failure of a single line . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dada model and the uswi model react very similarly to that failure , and that their blackout characteristics resemble each other . in many cases , </S>",
    "<S> the failure of a single line can cause cascading failures , which impact the entire grid . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the resilience of the grid by three parameters , the most important of which is tolerance @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize a blackout by its yield , which we define as the ratio of the final to the initial consumed currents . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if @xmath1 , the probability of a large blackout occurring is very small . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in a broad range of @xmath2 , the initial failure of a single line can result , with a high probability , in cascading failures leading to a massive blackout with final yield less than 80% . </S>",
    "<S> the yield has a bimodal distribution typical of a first - order transition , i.e. , the failure of a randomly selected line leads either to an insignificant current reduction or to a major blackout . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a latent period in the development of major blackouts during which few lines are overloaded , and the yield remains high . </S>",
    "<S> the duration of this latent period is proportional to the tolerance . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the latent period suggests that intervention during early time steps of a cascade can significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout . </S>"
