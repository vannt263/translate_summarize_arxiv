    "a good teacher knows the value of analogy and universality when explaining difficult concepts . a hard problem can be much simpler to elucidate when students have been exposed to a similar problem .",
    "for instance , students understand electrical forces better after they are acquainted with gravitational forces .",
    "terms such as _ energy _ become gradually more familiar as it is encountered in a variety of contexts . in this paper",
    "we aim to introduce and enlarge the concept of _ impedance _ to undergraduates and advanced high school students by investigating energy transfer in mechanical collisions and tracing a parallel with the propagation of light in electromagnetic systems .",
    "we define the _ characteristic impedance _ of a system as the ratio between a _ force - like quantity _ and _ a velocity - like quantity _ @xcite . from this definition",
    "we derive an expression for the mechanical impedance of a billiard ball , which tells how to enhance the energy transfer from one mass to another in elastic collisions .",
    "most importantly , we investigate how impedance matching appears in mechanical systems and we compare our results with the well - known problem of impedance matching in optical systems .",
    "our mechanical system consists of the one - dimensional elastic non - relativistic collision between two or three particles with different masses .",
    "this is simply the popular textbook problem of one - dimensional elastically colliding billiard balls .",
    "we observe how much kinetic energy is transmitted from one ball to the other during the collision .",
    "before we introduce the idea of impedance in mechanical systems , let us use the conservation laws of linear momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions to find the fraction of transmitted energy from one object to the other .",
    "we consider three rigid billiard balls of masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "let us assume that ball 1 has a finite speed and both balls 2 and 3 are at rest before the collision .",
    "after the first collision between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , part of the kinetic energy from ball 1 has been transmitted to ball 2 , which now has a velocity in the same direction as the initial velocity of ball 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . using momentum and kinetic energy conservation , one obtain , for the fraction of kinetic energy transmitted from the first to the second ball , @xmath3 where we define @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 is the initial kinetic energy of ball 1 and @xmath6 is the kinetic energy of ball 2 after the collision .",
    "the fraction of energy that remains in the first ball , which we consider as a  reflected \" energy , is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy of the first ball after the collision .",
    "analogously , in the second collision between balls 2 and 3 , the fraction of kinetic energy that is transferred to the third ball is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the kinetic energy of @xmath2 after the second collision .",
    "the fraction of energy transferred from the first to the third ball in the process is given by @xmath12 , which can be written , using ( [ t_12 ] ) and ( [ t_23 ] ) , as @xmath13 where we define @xmath14 and @xmath15 has been replaced with the equivalent expression @xmath16 . from this equation",
    "we see that , for any fixed value of @xmath17 , there are many values of @xmath18 which give different fractions of transmitted kinetic energy from the first to the third ball .",
    "we compare it with the configuration when the intermediate ball @xmath1 is removed , in which case the transferred energy is given by @xmath19 . equating this with eq .",
    "[ t_transferred ] we find two roots : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the plot for this configuration is shown in fig .  [ intermediate_masses ] , where we examine the behavior of ( [ t_transferred ] ) for two particular values of the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "we observe that , for each @xmath17 , there exists a range of values between @xmath20 and @xmath17 , such that more energy is transmitted in the presence of @xmath1 than when this intermediate mass is absent .        in order to proceed further , we ask ourselves whether this special range of values can be enlarged such that a maximum amount of kinetic energy can be transferred from the first to the third ball . indeed , fixing @xmath0 and @xmath2 , this can be obtained by taking @xmath22 . investigating the second derivative , we find that @xmath23 has a maximum at @xmath24 , that is , when we take @xmath25 .",
    "the fraction of transferred energy in this case depends only on the ratio @xmath17 and is given by @xmath26 this answers our question about the value of the intermediate mass : when @xmath1 is equal to the geometric mean of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the transmitted kinetic energy is a maximum .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the behavior of eq .",
    "( [ t_max ] ) for several values of the ratio @xmath17 and compares it with the configuration where the intermediate ball @xmath1 is absent .",
    "we observe that with an intermediate ball with mass @xmath25 we always transfer more kinetic energy from @xmath0 to @xmath2 , and when @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 , the presence of @xmath1 is irrelevant ( transmission coefficient is equal to unity ) . a similar calculation for partially elastic collisions between @xmath29 masses",
    "was carried out by j. b. hart and r. b. herrmann @xcite .",
    "we expand on their results by emphasizing the analogy with impedance matching in the following sections .",
    "if this is done in class as a demonstration , the students will be faced with the question that arises from the results : _ why does the presence of the intermediate ball facilitate the transmission of energy ? would nt it be more reasonable to expect that the presence of an extra ball would reduce the transmission of kinetic energy _ ?",
    "this question , as we will see in the following sections , is more easily answered if it is introduced in the context of _ impedance matching_.",
    "we know from electromagnetism that the transfer of energy through the interface between different media depends on their respective values of impedance @xmath30 . for an electromagnetic wave traveling from , say , medium 1 to medium 3 , the coefficients of reflection ( @xmath31 ) and transmission ( @xmath32 ) , known as fresnel coefficients  @xcite ,",
    "are associated with the fraction of reflected energy @xmath33 and transmitted energy @xmath23 , such that @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the indices of refraction of the media 1 and 3 respectively and @xmath38 ) .",
    "although in optical systems the coefficient @xmath31 is given in terms of the indices of refraction as @xmath39 , more generally it can be expressed in terms of the impedances of the media as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the impedance of medium @xmath42 . since the sum of the reflected and transmitted parts has to be unity , we obtain @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , when the two media have the same impedance , all energy is transmitted and @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this problem is similar to the mechanical problem we described in the previous section if we add an intermediate medium with impedance @xmath46 .",
    "once again , we are interested in the energy transfer in the problem and we can ask the question : _ what is the value of @xmath46 for which the transmission of energy from medium 1 to medium 3 is maximum _ ?    in order to solve this problem , we note that in this configuration the fraction of energy transmitted from medium 1 to medium 2 is @xmath47 and the fraction transmitted from medium 2 to medium 3 is @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the transmission coefficient from medium 1 to medium 3 , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 the maximum transmission @xmath51 occurs for @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath46 that allows for maximum energy transfer from medium 1 to medium 3 is the geometric mean of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which represents the so - called _ impedance matching_. this derivation can be found in many advanced textbooks in electromagnetism , acoustics and optics  @xcite ; in introductory texts of physics usually impedance matching is only briefly mentioned in the study of electric circuits @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that impedance matching is also the concept behind the anti - reflective coatings found in eyeglasses , binoculars , and other lenses .",
    "notice that the value found for the matching impedance @xmath46 resembles our previous result for the intermediate mass @xmath1 in section ii ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we explore this in the next section .",
    "we now return to the concept of impedance as the ratio between a force - like quantity and a velocity - like quantity @xcite in order to find out what would play the role of impedance in a mechanical system such as rigid billiard balls .",
    "as investigated in section ii , in these collisions the force - like quantity is not simply the force @xmath55 due to the collision , but the integrated effect of this force during the collision time @xmath56 .",
    "this is the impulse @xmath57 that the target ball receives from the incident one . here ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the initial and final time of collision , respectively .",
    "therefore , in the general case of a frontal collision between two balls in which the target ball is at rest , we obtain @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ impulse ] ) @xmath61 is the response of the ball to the impulse @xmath62 .",
    "we ascribe the impedance @xmath63 to a rigid billiard ball , considered as a particle of mass @xmath64 .",
    "this explains why the presence of the intermediate ball facilitates the transmission of energy in the elastic collisions studied in sec .",
    "ii . the choice @xmath25 works as an impedance matching between two media of impedances @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in a very well - known problem in classical mechanics , one aligns three rigid balls of different masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . the value of @xmath1 , a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , is to be determined such that when the one - dimensional collisions between these objects are elastic , the transmission of kinetic energy from the first ball to the last ball is maximized .",
    "this problem is easily solved using the laws of energy and linear momentum conservation , and we verify that the presence of an intermediate ball enhances rather than suppresses the transmission of energy . in this paper",
    "we present an explanation for this problem by proposing an extension of the concept of impedance , usually associated with oscillatory systems , to a rigid billiard ball .",
    "we have shown that in the case of one - dimensional elastic collisions , the mass of a particle can be seen as a measure of its impedance .",
    "once this is assumed , we verify that for maximum energy transfer the intermediate mass must be chosen such that it matches the impedances of the first and third mass , each considered as a different medium with their respective impedances .",
    "this can be easily explored in the classroom , either by a computer simulation or an actual experiment ( an experimental device has been proposed by hart and herrmann  @xcite ) .",
    "once students are exposed to the idea behind impedance matching with a simple classical collision problem , this can be expanded into a discussion of impedance of electric circuits , acoustics , and optical media .",
