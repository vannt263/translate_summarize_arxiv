    "in january of 2001 a study on the physics potential of a new high intensity proton source facility ( @xmath50.5mw)@xcite at fermilab was requested by mike shaevitz .",
    "the idea was that such a facility could be the basis of a high quality u.s .",
    "based physics program , to be operated between the second half of this decade and the commissioning of the next major u.s . facility . by that summer , the working group had concluded that a rich and coherent program in  flavor physics \" could be achieved@xcite , and that the proton driver(pd ) would have a large impact on a variety of programs that are currently being pursued at fermilab using the existing machines as well as the potential for new facilities .",
    "experiments that would clearly benefit from a new pd included among others , the neutrino experiments covering both the hot topic of oscillations ( e.g. minos and boone ) as well as non - oscillation physics .",
    "the possible new facilities are a neutron spallation source and a high intensity low energy muon source",
    ". these facilities would be competitive and complementary to other existing or proposed facilities , and would attract new users to fermilab .    in december 2001 by mike  shaevitz and steve  holmes requested to re - invigorate the pd studies .",
    "steve holmes was interested in pursuing an updated machine study with the goal of having a new design in time for the icfa workshop on high intensity high brightness hadron beams that took place at fermilab on april  8 - 12 of  2002@xcite .",
    "mike  shaevitz requested a strong and detailed updated physics study to be presented first at the same icfa workshop and have final report by the pac scheduled for june ,  2002 .",
    "the new goals were to identify a range of accelerator configurations that could provide 0.5 - 2mw of average beam power at 8 - 120  gev , describe the physics program that could be supported and identify required beamlines and detectors .",
    "the scope of this study was to be limited to three strong physics topics that could be pursued with a new pd .",
    "conceptual designs for the beam lines , targets and detectors were required , as well as consideration of a physics program based on both a stand alone source and an upgraded main injector .",
    "this document is the response to the request from shaevitz and holmes from the physics working group .",
    "even though we focused on the physics program , we also include a discussion of proton economics at fermilab in order to shows that the physics goals considered will require a significant increase in the proton resources at fermilab . only with an upgraded proton source , such as the one described in  @xcite",
    "would we be able to achieve the physics objectives listed here , and fully capitalize on the fermilab program already in place .",
    "there are many benefits that would come from a proton driver upgrade . in this document",
    "we focus on three physics areas : neutrino oscillations , static neutron properties and cpt tests with anti - protons . in all three areas fermilab can make unique and important physics contributions .    however , there is no doubt that neutrino physics is going through a revolutionary moment , and that neutrino masses and mixings are already giving us new insights into the origin of flavor .",
    "in addition , given the evidences for neutrino mass , leptogenesis is gaining momentum as the origin of cosmic baryon asymmetry , and therefore cp violation in the lepton sector must be tested .",
    "for these reasons , and many others , we have made our main emphasis neutrino oscillation physics , which is the first topic covered . in the near future ,",
    "at fermilab we will definitively open  ( or close ) the door to new physics  @xcite in the neutrino sector by confirming  ( or not ) the lsnd anomaly  @xcite with miniboone data  @xcite . in case",
    "that lsnd is confirmed we need even more protons than what we have available in the current booster .",
    "the physics case that should follow , in the case that miniboone confirms lsnd and in the availability of a new pd was already discussed in detailed in our previous report  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the experiments that are critical should lsnd not be confirmed .",
    "more detailed studies of the other two topics , static neutron properties and cpt tests with anti - protons , should come at a later date .    _ neutrino oscillations : _ we describe in detail a proposal for an _ off - axis _ neutrino experiment utilizing the numi beamline . as we will show in the following sections , this and the next generation of neutrino experiments can measure most of the leptonic mixing angles and mass - squared differences from which it will be possible to infer the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the detector design will ensure the observation of @xmath6 appearance , if the last unmeasured angle in the leptonic mixing matrix  ( @xmath7 ) is large enough . depending on the outcome",
    ", it will be possible to observe cp violations , if they exist , by taking data with an anti - neutrino beam . at that stage of the program",
    ", the key to success is the higher proton flux afforded by the proton driver .",
    "we show that this project can be staged to match fermilab resources .",
    "_ neutron static properties : _ the electric dipole moment  ( edm ) of the neutron could provide a window on new physics , as has been appreciated for many years .",
    "the current measurements constrain important parameters in supersymmetry , for example .",
    "the next generation of experiments will likely require a pulsed source of neutrons in order to control systematics .",
    "as observed already in earlier reports on the proton driver  @xcite , a world class spallation neutron source could be built at fermilab utilizing the proton driver which would have unique capabilities and compliment other facilities elsewhere .",
    "_ cpt tests with anti - protons : _ general interest in tests of cpt symmetry is growing as experimental efforts improve and theoretical possibilities for cpt violation are recognized .",
    "some of the most important work has been done with anti - protons at cern , using the ad ( ` anti - proton decelerator ' ) .",
    "this program will be terminated , however , as cern focuses its resources on the lhc . at fnal",
    "we already have an anti - proton source , therefore fermilab is good candidate for the next generation of anti - proton and anti - hydrogen experiments",
    ". the program can start with the current facilities , and ultimately be enhanced with the proton driver .",
    "_ an off - axis experiment in combination with a pd upgrade would be capable of observing both @xmath8 and @xmath9 appearance , and @xmath10 disappearance .",
    "in addition , the experiment will be able to measure precisely the atmospheric parameters , measure or make stringent exclusions of @xmath11 , and ultimately search for cp violation in the lepton sector and determine the mass hierarchy once the new proton driver becomes available .",
    "several detector technologies with the required physics specifications are available at varying cost and level of complexity .",
    "modest changes are required for the numi beam line , which is already approved and currently under construction . _",
    "+ we describe a search for neutrino oscillations in the atmospheric neutrino allowed region . the off - minos ( off - axis detector  main injector neutrino oscillation search ) program could have two phases .",
    "the first phase assumes a total of 125 kton / years s ) .",
    "we need five years to complete the program with a detector with a 20 kton fiducial mass with numi  as is \" , or a 5 kton fiducial mass detector with a pd upgrade .",
    "the same program can be completed in just 1.5 years in case that we have both a pd upgrade and a 20 kton detector . ] , and we will be able to :    * extend the search for @xmath8 appearance for a factor bigger than 20 past the current experimental bound at a three sigma level . *",
    "obtain an exclusion for @xmath8 appearance for @xmath12 , at a two sigma level .",
    "this is approximately twenty times beyond current limits and almost an order of magnitude better than the minos expectation if no signal is observed .",
    "* precision measurements of atmospheric @xmath13 parameters . despite the large suppression",
    "we expect more than 10 @xmath14 fully reconstructed events per kton / year .",
    "after the full program is completed we should have 1% measurement of the atmospheric oscillation parameters . *",
    "the search for @xmath9 appearance will be inferred from measurements of the neutral current rate , which would constrain the sterile neutrinos sector .    the actual program for a second phase will depend on the outcome of the first stage .",
    "if @xmath8 appearance were discovered , then one may devote as much as 300kton / year of running time to anti - neutrinos .",
    "( a longer exposure is required to compensate for the smaller cross section . ) at this stage the new proton driver is crucial . in this case",
    "the goals are :    * search of cp violation in the lepton sector , and measurement of the cp - phase .",
    "* determination of the mass hierarchy .",
    "if @xmath8 appearance were not observed in the first stage , then the search for @xmath8 would continue .",
    "the off - minos experiment should be taking data by 2007 in order to be concurrent with the jhf - to - superk program . using a modular design",
    ", the off - minos detector could be staged according to the availability of resources .",
    "the final detector design is still under discussion , but it is clear that we need detectors that will provide high reconstruction efficiencies for charged @xmath0 current events ( @xmath15 ) , while keeping the neutral current background below the two per mil level . the detector should be located 9 - 10  km from the beam axis and at a baseline between 735 - 900  km from the neutrino source .    this experiment is compatible with the minos program .",
    "the off - minos experiment represents an important and unique opportunity to take full advantage of the numi investment and expand the neutrino oscillation program at fermilab .",
    "a proton driver will be crucial to reach the ultimate goal of neutrino oscillations , cp - violations .",
    "_ the new proton driver  @xcite will give a proton beam in the mw range that could produce a world - class spallation neutron source using a small fraction  ( 4/30 ) of its total power .",
    "an intense room - temperature neutron source  @xcite , suitable for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments  @xcite , can be made at fnal by optimizing the target and moderator system for long pulses ( @xmath16s ) .",
    "this source will be complimentary to the short - pulse sources ( @xmath17s ) optimized for materials research such as the sns at ornl and jhf in japan .",
    "_   + the advantages of a long - pulse neutron source include  @xcite : ( 1 )  high peak intensities that can provide the most intense long - wavelength neutron sources , ( 2 )  the use of time - of - flight  ( tof ) techniques to measure energies , and ( 3 )  reduced backgrounds because of the favorable duty factor",
    ". this would permit the investigation of a number of important particle physics questions such as time - symmetry violation , baryon number conservation , parity - nonconservation in strong interactions , right - handed weak currents , and quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "the primary topic , in the view of colleagues at argonne and fermilab , is the measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment  ( edm ) .",
    "experimental discovery of cp violation in flavor - conserving channels would provide a clear indication of new physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "this stimulates continuing experimental efforts to detect edm s in elementary particles and heavy atoms @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary precision @xmath18  e - cm @xcite , obtained in measurements of the edm of the neutron , allows us to probe energy scales inaccessible in direct collider experiments .",
    "there have been two methods to search for the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "one pioneered by norman ramsey uses an external electric field to couple the edm , and the second pioneered by clifford shull uses the atomic electric fields during bragg scattering in a crystal . in both cases the edm precesses in the electric field in the same manner that a magnetic dipole precesses in a magnetic field and both experiments search for evidence of this precession using magnetic resonance techniques .",
    "as the amount of precession is inversely proportional to the time spent in the electric field , the sensitivity of the ramsey method has been improved through the use of ultracold neutrons that can be stored in material bottles for many minutes @xcite .",
    "atomic electric fields are much larger than those generated in the laboratory , however the time spent in the field is much smaller .",
    "increasing the sensitivity of this method depends on the use of multiple bragg scatters made possible by the use of perfect silicon crystals @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors differ for each method and as the edm measurement is important to particle physics it is necessary to have confirmation of a positive result .",
    "the current attempt to improve upon the ramsey method involves a milli - kelvin bath of liquid helium that effectively cools the neutrons and traps them @xcite .",
    "the method uses neutrons of about 1  mev with an acceptance bandwidth of @xmath19mev .",
    "the hope is to perform the magnetic resonance and detection in the same vessel that contains the liquid helium .",
    "estimates made for an ill reactor source show a possible improvement of three orders of magnitude in the edm sensitivity .",
    "however , from preliminary tests performed at the nist reactor @xcite , it appears that backgrounds generated by the higher energy neutrons in the beam is a serious problem .",
    "one solution would be to mount the experiment at a pulsed source and use tof to select only the `` useful '' neutrons .",
    "a long - pulse source will not provide the full 1  mev tof resolution , but it is estimated that even a 100  mev resolution would provide orders of magnitude improvement in the s / n ratio .    in the crystal edm experiment ,",
    "thousands of successive bragg scatters have been demonstrated in perfect silicon crystals  @xcite suggesting that this experiment may also provide up to two orders of magnitude improvement in the edm sensitivity .",
    "however , the experimental method requires a control measurement to isolate the edm  @xcite .",
    "one way to provide this would be to use 1.92a neutrons at the same time as 3.84a neutrons because both will bragg scatter in silicon .",
    "each wavelength responds differently to an edm precession and their effects can be separated at a pulsed source using tof .    in either case",
    "the first thing that needs to be done is to validate the model currently under consideration to produce a spallation source starting from 8  gev protons  @xcite .",
    "this first step can be made at the booster abort area , and a proposal is under preparation .",
    "_ as discussed in the proton driver physics study  @xcite , the addition of the recycler ring to the fermilab accelerator complex provides an opportunity to continue the program of @xmath20 physics with the anti - proton source accumulator .",
    "we have found that the proton driver will have a negligible impact on luminosity delivered to the collider , while significantly increasing the luminosity received by an experiment at the accumulator . _",
    "+ the operational scenario for the @xmath20 source presented here utilizes the recycler ring as an anti - proton bank from which the colliders makes ` withdrawals ' as needed to maintain the required luminosity in the tevatron .",
    "the accumulator is only needed to re - supply the bank between withdrawals . when the @xmath20 stacking rate is sufficiently high , and the luminosity requirements of the collider experiments are sufficiently low , there will be time between collider fills and subsequent refilling of the recycler to deliver beam to an experiment in the accumulator . in the scenario described in  @xcite ,",
    "the impact of the accumulator experiment on the luminosity delivered to the collider experiments is very small .",
    "if the run ii anti - proton stacking rate goals are met , the operational conditions required for running accumulator based experiments will be met during the btev era . a simple model of the operation of the fermilab accelerator complex for btev and an experiment in the collider has been developed  @xcite .",
    "the model makes predictions of the rate at which luminosity is delivered to btev and an accumulator experiment .",
    "the impact of the proton driver is incorporated into the model as a multiplicative factor that is applied to the accumulator base stacking rate .",
    "the model generates collider stores and accumulator stores according to the following priorities :    * 1st priority : put a store in the tevatron for btev * 2nd priority : stack @xmath20 s into the recycler until there are sufficient @xmath20 s for two collider stores * 3rd priority stack and decelerate @xmath20 s for the accumulator experiment    the model accumulates the integrated luminosity delivered to btev and to the accumulator experiment . for the results reported here , the model simulated collider and accumulator running over a period of 200 days .",
    "the model s determination of the luminosity delivered to the accumulator experiment is based on measurements made during the 2000 run of fermilab experiment e835 .",
    "two separate model runs were done - one with and one without an enhancement of the stacking from the proton driver .",
    "the model assumes that the proton driver will increase the accumulator base stacking rate by a factor of three production target by a factor of 3 or 4 . without additional upgrades to the anti - proton source ( i.e. to the stacktail momentum cooling ) , the increase in protons on target will not be translated into the same increase in @xmath20 production rate . ] .",
    "the results of these runs are summarized in table  [ table_ap_5 ] .",
    ".model results for @xmath20 production.[table_ap_5 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the physics program of fermilab becomes less well - defined in this era .",
    "we note that the following experiments may all exist at this time with some demands for protons and/or demands on modification of the acceleration cycle from the fastest possible :    * boone ( or other follow - on booster neutrino experiments ) : needs only booster or new proton driver protons . * ckm : requires slow - spill extraction from the main injector .",
    "this has a significant impact on cycle time for experiments which do not require a slow spill .",
    "we assume that a `` reasonable compromise '' will be that the cycle average cycle - time reduction for anti - proton production and neutrino experiments might be about 30% .",
    "* btev : requires anti - proton production as for the current / future collider program .",
    "* minos : we anticipate that regardless of a new neutrino experiment that it will be interesting to extend running of minos either with anti - neutrinos or for extended precision with neutrinos .",
    "* new off - axis numi experiment : as discussed elsewhere in this document we anticipate this to be a new important part of the fermilab program .",
    "but it makes no additional demands on protons from minos ! * test beams and other uses : we assume that these uses will be limited to no more than 10% impact on the high - rate proton production .",
    "most likely , it can be parasitic to the impact of ckm and hence we do not include it in the impact on high - rate proton production .    hence , the demand for protons goes up in this timescale , making relatively fewer protons available for each experiment . using the `` medium investment '' estimate for proton acceleration from table  [ tab : protonintensity ]",
    "we find that protons available for neutrino experiments in this era will remain below what the nominal proposal expectations set for the minos experiment .",
    "specifically , the minos expectation is @xmath21 protons per year , corresponding to main injector power of 0.4 mw .",
    "however , the number of protons which will be delivered to the numi target in 2008 if all of the above conditions exist will be just @xmath22 . given that the demands for anti - neutrino running for minos and/or better reach in an off - axis detector call for yet more protons to the numi target , it is clear that some additional investment in proton acceleration is essential if all of these programs are to run simultaneously .",
    "we see that significant investment in the existing complex can in fact deliver more protons , but the demand from the remaining program still means that only @xmath23 protons per year can be delivered to the numi target .",
    "we note that this number is based on a rather large new investment in the existing accelerator complex , some of which will be attractive anyway if one anticipates a new proton driver .",
    "although even more dramatic investments in the `` existing '' complex are possible ( superbunch acceleration in both the booster and main injector for instance ) these start to become rather expensive and begin to be on the class of a new proton driver in order to go very much beyond the intensities that the `` significant investment '' level affords .    the ultimate beam for a superbeam program at fnal will require a new proton driver .",
    "the proton driver design described in  @xcite will allow us to bring the numi neutrino beam power up from 0.4  mw to 1.6  mw .",
    "this design is based on an 8  gev circular machine with a circumference of 473.2  m , and it will provide @xmath24 protons per pulse instead of the assumed @xmath25 of the current booster .",
    "in addition , the total luminosity could be further increased by 30% if the current linac gets a 200  mev upgrade . in this case",
    ", we would get @xmath26 protons per pulse .",
    "this machine is estimated to cost us$160 m .",
    "an alternative design made out of only a linac to accelerate protons up to 8  gev , using sns and tesla style superconducting cavities , is also under investigation  @xcite .    in either case",
    ", changes to numi will be required , and are listed in appendix [ appendb ] , but the possibility of having a broad physics program that includes projects like numi and boone running concurrently becomes realistic .",
    "with the turn - on of the lhc in the next decade , fermilab will relinquish its long - held position as the energy frontier in particle physics .",
    "however , given the considerable expertise that will still be resident here , and the experimental infrastructure that is currently being built , fermilab can make a transition into being the intensity frontier of particle physics , and can take advantage of the considerable investment this field has already made in this laboratory . by upgrading the proton source that currently supplies both the collider and neutrino programs , fermilab can not only take the next important step in neutrino flavor physics measurements , but can also extend its reach in anti - proton studies , and possibly the the host of a new cold neutron source .    while currently the most outstanding issue of neutrino flavor physics is the size of the last unmeasured mixing angle , @xmath27",
    ", seeing evidence for it is only the beginning of the story .",
    "the ultimate goals for neutrino flavor experiments are to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , and if possible measure leptonic cp violation ( assuming the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle lies in the lma region ) .",
    "both generations of experiments require a very intense neutrino beam to be able to use a long baseline , preferably with a very narrow energy spectrum to reduce the considerable backgrounds associated with these measurements .",
    "the numi facility which is currently being built can provide such a beam , but a new detector sensitive to @xmath0 appearance is required . to get to the second generation of experiments ,",
    "namely the determination of the mass hierarchy and search for cp violation , a very intense anti - neutrino beam is required , and in order to make up for the lower anti - neutrino cross section .",
    "an upgrade of the proton source at fermilab could be the step which finally enables us to know the number of heavy neutrinos , and ultimately whether or not there is cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the following is an annotated list of issues currently under discussion for possible improvements in the accelerator complex on this time scale :    1 .",
    "linac : upgrades to the existing linac offer no direct increase in intensity in the complex but some improvements could offer indirect benefits .",
    "* energy increase to lower space - charge effects at injection to booster ?",
    "this could reduce proton losses and permit an extracted beam with smaller phase - space .",
    "the end result could be an increase in the total number of protons which can be accelerated in the booster as well as better - behaved beams for stacking purposes .",
    "the cost is relatively high . *",
    "chopped beam for cleaner capture in booster : this could reduce proton losses , allowing more acceleration cycles per year .",
    "this is not a very developed concept .",
    "2 .   booster : proton acceleration in the booster is currently limited by unstable beam at high intensities leading to radiation from proton losses and extracted beam with poor properties for additional acceleration .",
    "booster upgrades can both directly increase intensity and make for higher mi intensity by providing clean beams for stacking and easy acceleration .",
    "limitations in the direct intensity increase are not completely understood but many experts estimate that it should be possible to increase intensity from the current typical operating mode , @xmath28 protons per batch , to @xmath29 protons per batch .",
    "the cost of most of these systems for the booster are very modest compared to the cost of a new proton driver , but the returns are correspondingly modest .",
    "* reduction in space - charge effects at injection by making longer bunches or adding electron shielding ? * new hardware to help stabilize the beam and reduce proton losses including : 1 .   ramped correctors 2 .",
    "new rf damping hardware 3 .",
    "new collimators 4 .",
    "larger rf cavities 5 .",
    "inductive inserts 6",
    ".   additional acceleration rf harmonic cavities 3 .",
    "main injector : improvements in the main injector fall into three main categories ; decreasing the cycle time , improvements to permit the machine to handle more total proton flux , regardless of source , and proton stacking schemes . as the total current of protons in the machine",
    "is increased , it will be necessary to add extra rf power and damping under any circumstance , even with a new proton source .",
    "hence , much of that investment can be viewed as `` on the path '' of the proton source . *",
    "additional rf power to handle extra proton intensity and permit reduction in cycle time .",
    "reduction in cycle time could be as much as 25% with no modification to existing rf cavities .",
    "* reduction in cycle time by `` tuning '' the acceleration cycle .",
    "this probably would require very little new hardware and could result in a reduction in cycle time of 10 - 15% .",
    "* new rf damper electronics and components .",
    "this would be necessary to go to higher intensity and more sophisticated and expensive as the intensity goes even higher . * inductive inserts to improve stability .",
    "* collimators to protect critical components from beam losses . *",
    "yet more rf power with cavity modifications and/or new cavities to reduce the ramp time even more and the total cycle time by as much as a factor of 2 .",
    "* slip stacking : unlikely to be of interest for multi - batch operation .",
    "* barrier rf stacking : appears promising for increasing protons accelerated to 120  gev by 60 - 70% .",
    "requires well - behaved booster beam and new barrier rf systems in main injector . operates on principles already in use in the recycler",
    "the numi beamline is designed to handle `` only '' 0.4mw of proton power , and will itself require modifications to allow it to accept five times the integrated proton power .",
    "a detailed description of the modifications required can be found in the proton driver machine study  @xcite . after a description of the beamline ,",
    "we give here only a brief synopsis of those modifications .",
    "in fact , the modifications required depend very significantly on what the ultimate increase in proton power is . if one were to run numi with twice the proton power",
    ", the modifications would not need to be as extensive .",
    "furthermore , several of the modifications can be avoided by changing the proton beam spot size , which although not trivial , is feasible .",
    "the neutrino beam at numi is created when 120gev protons from the main injector strike a 0.94 m graphite target located roughly 40 m below ground in the numi tunnel .",
    "the secondary pions and kaons are then focused by two horns towards a 670 m decay pipe . the uninteracted protons and particles that did not decay hit the hadron absorber , located about 725 m from the target .",
    "finally , beamline monitors measure the distribution of particles both upstream and downstream of the hadron absorber , and also in alcoves embedded in dolomite farther downstream .",
    "the target , the horns , and the decay pipe itself all are water cooled , and even for 0.4mw the entire beamline requires an impressive amount of shielding due to radiation concerns .",
    "the modifications necessary for the primary beam optics are the most trivial , assuming a cycle time at or near 1.87seconds . because the beamline is designed to match the dynamic aperture of the main injector , whatever the main injector supplies , the beamline can take .",
    "however , the losses per minute must be maintained at the same level as those with 0.4mw proton power , so additional collimation may be required .",
    "the modifications necessary for the numi target and horns depend critically on the spot size of the incoming proton beam . with a factor of 5 more intensity",
    "the numi target would be too hot after just a few pulses , with the current proton spot size .",
    "however , if both the proton beam spot size were increased by a factor of three above the current design , and the target itself was a rod three times the beam width , then the same material could withstand the increase in proton power , with similar cooling design .",
    "in fact , the current numi target is taller than it is wide , so it is estimated that if one had just twice the proton spot size in the vertical direction , and twice the proton power the target would not need to be upgraded . increasing",
    "the proton spot size also means the decay pipe windows would not have to be modified from their current designs .",
    "the numi horns themselves suffer the most from the repeated pulsing , not from the passage of particles through them .",
    "thus they could withstand an increase in power .",
    "however an increase in the repetition rate would change the expected horn s lifetime .",
    "the current lifetime expectancy is 1year , for a 1.87second repetition rate .",
    "the modifications for cooling the beamline are the most severe .",
    "the target area is currently cooled by a very high air flow rate . if there were 5 times the proton power the region would have to be water cooled instead .",
    "the decay pipe itself is currently being cooled by water flowing through pipes that run along its entire 670 m length .",
    "the section that would require additional cooling is less than a third of this , however .",
    "one could conceivably cut holes in the concrete shielding and add cooling pipes in that area .",
    "finally , the hadron absorber itself would also need to be modified to allow more cooling , although the modification is not severe  the core is currently water cooled , only the first block of steel which is not cooled now would need to change .",
    "all of these upgrades require modifications to what will be highly radioactive components .",
    "finally , the increase in proton power will also require a new analysis of radiation safety issues .",
    "the issue of proton beam losses remaining low was addressed earlier , and if those proton beam losses are maintained , other radiation safety issues will be quite manageable .",
    "these issues are currently being addressed using extrapolations from other data , which necessarily bring in significant uncertainties , which translate into large safety factors .",
    "it is expected that the measurements of the water pumped from the numi tunnel and released to the surface waters will be greater than a factor of ten below the surface water limits .",
    "similarly it is expected that measurements from numi s monitoring wells will be negligible .",
    "extrapolating from these measurements would show an upgrade in a factor of 4 in intensity to be feasible .",
    "as for airborne activation , it is likely that the target shielding and hadron absorber will need additional air seals , but given the new cooling that will also be required , this would be a minor additional cost .    in summary",
    ", the most significant upgrades required in the numi beamline would be those associated with cooling and sealing the target hall , and a new target with cooling .",
    "the decay pipe and absorber cooling would be the next most costly changes .",

    "<S> this document is the second in a series of reports on the exciting physics that would be accessible at fermilab in the event of an upgraded proton source . </S>",
    "<S> where the first report covered a broad range of topics , this report focuses specifically on three areas of study : there are brief discussions on the new measurements one could make in both the neutron and anti - proton sectors , and then a detailed discussion of what could be achieved in the neutrino oscillation sector using an upgraded proton source to supply the numi beamline with more protons . if one places a new detector optimized for @xmath0 appearance at a new location slightly off the axis defined by the minos experiment , that new experiment would be ideal for making the next important steps in lepton flavor studies , namely , the search for @xmath1 at the atmospheric mass splitting , and cp violations . </S>",
    "<S> the report concludes with a summary of proton economics and demands for increased proton intensity for the booster and main injector : what the proton source at fermilab can currently supply , and what adiabatic changes could be implemented to boost the proton supply on the way from here to a proton driver upgrade .    # </S>",
