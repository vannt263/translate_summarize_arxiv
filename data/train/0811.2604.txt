    "14 ( a ) appears to have a shape similar to the m vs. h data in fig . 5 , and this could imply that the residual contribution from the dipole moment of the sample is still dominating the measured signal at the new preferred location for the record of the quadrupolar contribution .",

    "14 , which purports to support the significant presence of the contribution from the quadrupolar moment of the sample at the new location .",
    "it may be mentioned that at the field values of the flux jumps , the measured signal gets out of the range of the plot with the lock - in amplifier settings getting overboard momentarily and it returns to within the range only when the process of the flux jump is complete . a motivated search for such an occurrence ( i.e.",
    ", signal getting out of range ) in the magnetization response at the usual central position of the astatic pair of the coils , did not yield an affirmative answer .",

    "it can be noted that @xmath48 line for y1221 is flat , while it decreases with temperature for lu1221 .",

    ", it is also evident that the bg state spans over a larger ( h , t ) space in lu1221 as compared to that in y1221 , attesting to the fact that lesser residual disorder prevails in the former sample .",

    "similar flux jumps have also been observed in a cleaner crystal ( as compared to those of @xmath0 ) of @xmath4 at lower fields ( h @xmath3 25  mt ) , giving support to an assertion made by us .",
    "another evidence in support of our conjecture could come from the measurement of quadrupole signal ( q ) in @xmath0 using a vsm .",

    "the onset of a smp anomaly at a lower field in the crystal of @xmath0 as compared to that in @xmath4 could be termed as consistent with the occurrence of @xmath23 transition at a higher field in it .",
