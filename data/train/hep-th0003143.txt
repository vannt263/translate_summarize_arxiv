    "recent developments in the technique for the calculation of the zero point energy of massive fields @xcite have opened interesting possibilities in the study of soft boundaries and smooth potentials with spherical and cylindrical geometry immersed in the vacuum of various quantum fields .",
    "the technique uses the jost function of the scattering problem related to the background potential under examination .",
    "the vacuum energy can be expressed as an integral containing the logarithm of a jost function with imaginary argument :    @xmath3    here the subscript @xmath4 represents the background potential , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the integration over the momentum @xmath7 and the summation over all other quantum numbers @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the mass of the quantum field , @xmath10 is a regularization parameter and @xmath11 a mass parameter .",
    "the jost function @xmath12 is unique and easily obtainable for many types of geometries with circular , spherical or cylindrical symmetry and for various types of potential profiles , which is the great advantage of this approach .",
    "representation ( 1 ) for the vacuum energy still needs a renormalization .",
    "the zeta functional representation of ( 1 ) and its heat kernel expansion are known to be a very effective tool in this context ( see for instance @xcite ) . the basic idea to define unambiguously a renormalized zero point energy , is to impose the condition that the vacuum energy is zero when the mass of the quantum field reaches infinity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the heat kernel coefficients themselves are also of great interest , they determine the asymptotic behaviour of the renormalized energy @xcite ; they are to be considered as an intrinsic local feature of the geometry and of the background under examination .",
    "this renormalization scheme and the above mentioned integral representation have been used to solve some basic configurations : the vacuum energy of scalar , spinor and electromagnetic fields in the background of spherical shells with hard and smooth potentials has been calculated @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the investigation has turned recently to magnetic fields with cylindrical symmetry . in paper",
    "@xcite a complete analysis of a spinor field in the background of an homogeneous magnetic flux tube of finite radius was carried out .",
    "the vacuum energy was found to be negative and it did not show a minimum for any finite value of the radius . a natural question is if inhomogeneous magnetic fields can minimize the energy and render the string stable .",
    "the question was already raised in @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends the investigation begun in @xcite to an inhomogeneous magnetic string with delta function profile .",
    "the delta function , although not a fully realistic physical model , represents a simple example of inhomogeneity , which could give an insight into the problem of vacuum energy in magnetic backgrounds .",
    "this kind of `` semi - transparent '' was already analyzed in @xcite for a sphere .",
    "it has some features in common with a smooth potential and some with a hard boundary . in paper",
    "@xcite the heat kernel coefficients for a general semi - transparent boundary were calculated .",
    "the quantum mechanics of spinor fields in the presence of magnetic fluxes has been elaborated in early works @xcite,@xcite while more recent investigation in this direction has been motivated by the interest in the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , @xcite .",
    "singular inhomogeneous magnetic fields were examined in @xcite for the calculation of the fermion determinant and in @xcite for the investigation of the bound states of an electron , however the ground state energy was not calculated in those works . in our paper",
    "the ground state energy will be calculated for a scalar and for a spinor field . in the first part of this paper",
    "we will calculate the jost functions for both fields , the heat kernel coefficients will be found and the energy will be renormalized imposing the vanishing of the vacuum fluctuations for fields of infinite mass .",
    "in the second part of the paper we will work numerically on the renormalized energy finding its asymptotic behaviour for small and for large values of the radius of the string .",
    "we will finally show some plots of the renormalized energy for various values of the strength of the potential .",
    "we quantize a scalar field @xmath13 in the presence of a classical magnetic field whose form is that of a cylindrical shell with delta function profile . the section of the string is a circle with radius @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic field is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the magnetic flux , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the axis along which the cylindrical shell extends to infinity .",
    "the quantum field obeys the klein- gordon equation for the scalar electrodynamics :    @xmath18    where @xmath9 is the mass of the field , and    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the electron charge , @xmath21 is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field and the convention @xmath22diag@xmath23 is used as well as the gauge @xmath24 .",
    "we want to find a solution of eq.(3 ) in cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 , then we take the relevant operators in ( 4 ) in the following form    @xmath27    @xmath28    the potential four vector @xmath29 associated with the magnetic field ( 2 ) contains a theta - function :    @xmath30    where @xmath31",

    "the conditions for the field at @xmath55 will be discussed later .",
    "a regularized vacuum energy can be defined as    @xmath56    where the @xmath57 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator associated with ( 4 ) ,",
    "@xmath58 being the index for the particle - anti - particle degree of freedom , while @xmath59 includes all oder quantum numbers .",
    "@xmath10 is the regularization parameter to be put to zero after the renormalization and @xmath11 is a mass parameter necessary to maintain the correct dimensions of the energy .",
    "the string is invariant under translations along the @xmath17 axis , therefore the energy density per unit length of the string is @xmath60 where the @xmath61 are the eigenvalues of the operator defined in ( 12 ) with @xmath62 .",
    "we perform the integration over @xmath63 in ( 19 ) , getting    @xmath64    the next step is to transform the summation in ( 20 ) into a contour integral .",
    "we enclose temporarily the system in a large cylindrical quantization box imposing some conditions for the field at this boundary , for instance dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "then we can express the eigenvalues @xmath61 by means of the zeros of solution ( 14 ) , which becomes an exact equation at infinity .",
    "the derivative of the logarithm of the solution will then have poles at @xmath65 .",
    "we can express ( 20 ) through an integral whose contour encloses these poles which lie on the real axis @xmath7 .",
    "the deformation of the contour on the imaginary axis and the dropping of the minkowski space contribution allows to reach the final form .",
    "@xmath66    where @xmath67 is the jost function with imaginary argument and @xmath68 is a simple function of the regularization parameter .",
    "the renormalization of ( 21 ) is carried out by direct subtraction of its divergent part    @xmath69    the isolation of the divergent part from the total energy will be performed via heat - kernel expansion as we will see in a moment . the subtracted part should be added in the classical part of the energy resulting in a renormalization of the classical parameters of the string ( in paper @xcite this procedure is well explained ) , however we do not treat the classical energy of the system here but only the vacuum contribution . for the analytical continuation @xmath70 we split @xmath71 it into a `` finite '' and an `` asymptotic '' part .",

    "the same remarks which we made in the scalar case about the numerical limits of summation and integration and about the precision employed in the computer graphics are valid here .",
    "in this paper we have carried out a complete calculation of the vacuum energy of two different fields in the background of a magnetic string with delta function profile .",
    "the renormalized vacuum energy is given in terms of convergent integrals ( eq.(65 ) and ( 67 ) for the scalar field , eq.(100 ) and ( 102 ) for the spinor field ) .",
    "a first remark can be made about the vanishing of the heat kernel coefficient @xmath2 in both scalar and spinor cases .",
    "this coefficient , contributing to @xmath286 , is not zero for a generic background potential .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath2 is also observed in a dielectric spherical shell with a squared profile @xcite .",
    "it could be argued that singular profiles possess less ultraviolet divergences than smooth profiles .",
    "this statement is also confirmed by the heat kernel coefficients calculated in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the sign of the energy on the radius @xmath0 of the string and on the potential strength @xmath33 is non trivial . in the scalar case",
    "the energy is negative only for large values of the potential strength , while for @xmath33 smaller than one , the energy shows a positive maximum ( fig .",
    "in the spinor case we have almost an opposite situation ( fig .",
    "10 ) : in the region @xmath287 the energy shows a negative minimum for @xmath288 , while it is positive for @xmath289 .",
    "however , when @xmath0 becomes large the vacuum energy shows the same behaviour for the scalar and for the spinor field : it is negative for large @xmath33 and positive for small @xmath33 .",
    "this strong dependence on the parameter @xmath290 was not observed in paper @xcite , where an homogeneous field inside the flux tube was investigated .",
    "in fact the most relevant result of our calculation is that the energy numerically shows a dependence on @xmath291 for large @xmath33 . in @xcite",
    "the contributions proportional to @xmath291 cancelled and the parts proportional to @xmath292 dominated the renormalized energy . the proportionality @xmath293 opens the possibility that the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field could render the vacuum energy larger than the classical energy of the string , when the boundary becomes sufficiently hard .",
    "the total energy of the system could , then , be dominated by the quantum contribution , in fact we have @xmath294 where @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 are numbers and @xmath298 is the fine structure constant .",
    "however in the model studied here , the profile of the potential contains a delta function and the classical energy is infinite .",
    "it would be interesting to study an inhomogeneous magnetic field which does not contain singularities in order to have a finite classical energy and possibly a vacuum energy depending on @xmath291 .",
    "unfortunately with more realistic potentials the calculations become more difficult .",
    "a feasible model would be that of a cylindrical shell with finite thickness and with a profile given by a finite height box . in this case the jost function would be expressed in terms of bessel functions and hypergeometric functions .",
    "this problem is left for future investigation .",
