    "t pyx is a recurrent nova with recorded outbursts in 1890 , 1902 , 1920 , 1944 and 1966 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is notable for possessing a bright nebular shell extensively investigated by shara et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and shara et al .",
    "recently , shahbaz et al .  ( 1997  hereafter s97 ) have presented optical spectroscopy of t pyx in which they identify emission components to the red and blue of h@xmath0 ( s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 respectively in their figure 1 ) which they interpret as red- and blue - shifted h@xmath0 emission from oppositely directed jets .",
    "these features occur at 6593 and 6539  @xmath4 respectively implying line - of - sight velocities of 1380 and @xmath5 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "on the night of november 21 - 22 1997 we obtained several spectra of t pyx with lris ( the low resolution imaging spectrograph , oke et al.1995 ) on the keck ii telescope on hawaii .",
    "two 400  second exposures were made at slit position angles of 30@xmath6 and 120@xmath6 .",
    "the 600 grooves  mm@xmath1 grating was used with a slit width of 1.5  arcsec matching the seeing .",
    "the pixel scale was 0.2  arcsec and the spectral resolution 8.8  @xmath7 .",
    "figure 1 shows a greyscale representation of the 2-dimensional spectrum from position angle 30@xmath6 clearly revealing the presence of an expanding shell emitting in [ nii ] and h@xmath0 with signal to noise ranging from 10 to 70 .",
    "the spectrum from position angle 120@xmath6 is similar although because the shell is not spherically symmetric ( see shara et al .",
    "1997 ) there are detailed differences . in order to relate these data to the spectra presented by s97 , figure 1 also includes the spectrum obtained by summing along the slit .",
    "although the spectral resolution is lower than that of s97 it is still obvious that their features s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 are in fact , respectively , the red - shifted component of [ nii ]  6583 and the blue - shifted component of [ nii ]  6548 .    further to this , by extracting the stellar continuum from our 2d spectrum using horne s optimal extraction method available in the software package figaro , and then subtracting this from the total spectrum shown in figure 1 , we obtain a reasonable approximation to the shell - only summed spectrum  see figure 2 . in this spectrum",
    "we have indicated the rest wavelengths of h@xmath0 and the two [ nii ] lines together with the positions of the blue- and red - shifted components arising from the front and back of a shell expanding at a velocity of 530  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the component at about 6573  @xmath7 ( arising from a combination of blue - shifted [ nii ]  6583 and red - shifted h@xmath0 ) is clearly visible in the spectrum in figure 1 of s97 , whilst the 6555  @xmath7 component ( from red - shifted [ nii ]  6548 and blue - shifted h@xmath0 ) is blended into the blue wing of h@xmath0 in their figure 1 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the expansion velocity from these spectra .",
    "apart from the problems of contamination between h@xmath0 and [ nii ] , the shell is clumpy and incomplete .",
    "the velocity of 530  km  s@xmath1 is derived from the wavelength 6595  @xmath7 of the red - shifted [ nii ]  6583 line at the point where it crosses the stellar continuum .",
    "this corresponds to the expansion velocity along a line of sight through the centre of the shell and hence will be independent of slit position angle .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath8  @xmath7 on this wavelength , equivalent to @xmath9  km  s@xmath1 , as a result of the contamination by the stellar continuum and of the spectral resolution .",
    "a better estimate would require more kinematical data at higher resolution across the whole shell and a plausible model for its structure . note that the summed spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 peaks shortward of 6595  @xmath7 because this particular feature is dominated by emission from a bright part of the shell 2 - 3  arcsec below the star ( see fig .",
    "1 ) which is at lower radial velocities .    in conclusion",
    "we suggest there is little evidence to support the existence of collimated jets in t pyx .",
    "the data are however consistent with the presence of a shell expanding at about 500  km  s@xmath1 and emitting more strongly in [ nii ] than in h@xmath0  this is in broad agreement with the findings of shara et al.(1989 ) .",
    "however , more detailed modelling of the structure of the shell and further higher spectral resolution observations are required in order to reconcile this line - of - sight expansion velocity with the upper limit on the velocity in the plane of the sky of 40  km  s@xmath1 derived from hubble space telescope observations of the proper motion of knots in the nebular shell ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are grateful to m.  shara and c.  gill for useful discussions and to an anonymous referee for helpful comments on the original version of this paper .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
