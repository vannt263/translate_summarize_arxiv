    "in dynamics , the time evolution of a physical system is often modeled by the iterates of a single transformation . however , multiple symmetries of some systems lead to the study of the join action of several commuting transformations , where new and deep phenomena occur .",

    "the higher dimensional analogue of a shift of finite type consists in all @xmath19-dimensional arrays of symbols from a finite alphabet subject to a finite number of local rules .",
    "such arrays can be shifted in each of the @xmath19 coordinate directions , giving @xmath19 commuting transformations .",

    "there are deep distinctions between the case @xmath20 and @xmath21 : for example , it is easy to describe the space of such arrays in the first case , but there is no general algorithm which will decide , given the set of local rules , whether or not the space of such arrays is empty in the second case .",
    "although the general theory of multi - dimensional shifts of finite type is still in a rudimentary stage , there are particular classes where significant progress was made , and where graphs and matrices play a useful role .",

    ", the particular case of shifts associated to rank @xmath19 graphs was studied by a. kumjian , d. pask and others . in this case , the translations in the coordinate directions are local homeomorphisms , and there is a canonical tale groupoid and a @xmath8-algebra associated to such a graph , which is morita equivalent to a crossed product of an af - algebra by the group @xmath22 . under some mild conditions , the groupoid is essentially free and the @xmath8-algebra is simple and purely infinite . for more details ,",
