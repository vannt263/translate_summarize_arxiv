    "the observational study of both transiting exoplanets and stellar pulsations has experienced enormous progress during the last few years .",
    "both require photometric measurements of the highest possible precision and with high duty cycle .",
    "ground - based observations are intrinsically limited in these respects due to the influence of the earth s atmosphere and the day / night cycle .",
    "consequently , the deployment of dedicated space photometry missions , in particular kepler ( e.g. , @xcite ) , represented a great leap for both fields .",
    "the first discovery of a planet around a star other than our sun was made by @xcite through the detection of timing variations , caused by the light travel time effect ( ltte ) , in the millisecond pulsar psr1257 + 12 . since then , a variety of other methods have been employed to discover many more extrasolar planets , among them the radial velocity method ( e.g.  harps  high precision chelle spectrograph ; * ? ? ? * ) and gravitational microlensing ( e.g.  the ogle project , * ? ? ?",
    "the most efficient method , however , has proved to be the transit method , with several dedicated wide - field survey instruments having been built to search for exoplanet transits ( e.g.  super - wasp , @xcite ; tres , @xcite ; hat , @xcite ; and many more ) .",
    "the main issue for such photometric surveys is the detection limit  limited not only by the collecting area of the telescopes employed but also by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "atmospheric disturbances can be corrected with adaptive optics , but such instrumentation is rarely used for high - precision photometry . therefore astronomers studying exoplanets had to wait for the launch of corot in 2006 @xcite and _ kepler _ in 2009 @xcite to circumvent this problem .",
    "both were specifically designed to find planets much smaller than those within the detection limits of ground - based surveys . since then , the `` _ _ space _ _ revolution '' of the field began .",
    "most stars are variable  this has been known for decades . the origins of this variability can differ greatly from star to star , but they can be divided into two main groups : extrinsic and intrinsic variables .",
    "extrinsic are those whose observed brightness does not change because of physical changes of the star , but rather because of other external effects , for example being eclipsed by a binary companion",
    ". intrinsic variables , on the other hand , change their physical properties  like pulsating stars changing their sizes and shapes .",
    "given the wide - range of causes for their observed variability , variable stars present a very broad range of amplitudes and periodicities .",
    "for example , only considering pulsating stars , the longest periods ( 100  1000 d ) are mira type variables , whilst the shortest ( 1  2 min ) are pulsating subdwarf o type stars ( see , e.g. , the summary by @xcite ) .    asteroseismology uses stellar oscillations as seismic waves to determine the internal structure of stars .",
    "it applies the same method as seismology to reveal the earth s interior . by comparing theoretical predictions of frequencies of oscillations with observed ones , we can learn about the stellar interiors , as the theoretical models must be altered to reproduce the observations .",
    "the photometric amplitude of stellar pulsations may be of the order of one part per million ( the present observational detection level ) up to several magnitudes . in comparison ,",
    "the decrease in flux from a transit of an earth - like planet is of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "transits , whose amplitudes are bigger than the amplitudes of the intrinsic brightness variations of their host stars are relatively easy to spot .",
    "difficulties arise when intrinsic variability begins to exceed that caused by planetary transits , where it can be said that such transits are `` hidden '' in pulsations .",
    "however , as transits result in clearly nonsinusoidal lightcurves , harmonic functions are well - suited for the process of detecting and subtracting pulsational signals , allowing the residuals to be searched for planetary transits . in this work ,",
    "we search for such planetary transits , which are of particular interest given that the pulsation properties can then be used to learn more about the host stars and hence also their transiting planets .",
    "one such case is that of kepler-444 @xcite , where the authors used asteroseismic methods to measure an age of 11 gyr for the star , or kepler-56",
    "@xcite , where asteroseismology was used to show that the planetary orbits are misaligned with respect to the stellar spin axis .",
    "two types of data are available from _ kepler _ : long cadence ( lc ) and short cadence ( sc ) . for long cadence data 270 frames and for short cadence data 9 frames are co - added ( each frame is 6.02 s exposure time plus 0.52 s readout time ) .",
    "this results in a total of 29.4 min and 58.85 s for long and short cadence , respectively .",
    "files including long cadence data ( images and light curves ) span a quarter , whilst short cadence data span a month . there are @xmath9156 000 lc and 512 sc targets for each observing interval ( i.e. quarter for lc , month for sc ) .",
    "long cadence data are primarily used for planet detection , while short cadence data are especially important for asteroseismology , better transit timing @xcite and transit light curve modelling .",
    "raw pixel data are transferred from the spacecraft once per month .",
    "each data set is then processed in parallel by the science pipeline @xcite .",
    "the resulting raw and calibrated light curves with estimates of uncertainties are then made available to the public via nasa s mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "the search criteria used to retrieve data for the search performed in this work were as follows :    1 .",
    "effective temperature + the search was conducted for temperatures in the range between 6000 and 8500 k. effective temperatures in _ kepler _ input catalog are from @xcite and are accurate to @xmath9200  k. such a wide range was needed to include stars of spectral type a and f in the classical instability strip , among which there are many pulsating stars of e.g. @xmath2 scuti or @xmath1 doradus type .",
    "target type + only stars with sc data were chosen , because as the cadence of lc data is unsuitable for detailed asteroseismic analysis and revealing the shape of any `` hidden '' transits .",
    "the search resulted in 7546 individual fits files , for a total of 2292 stars .",
    "each fits file contains multiple columns , from which two were taken for the further work : + time [ d ]  barycentric kepler julian day ( bkjd : bjd - 2454833 ) calculated for the target in the file , + pdcsap_flux [ e-/s ]  aperture photometry flux after pre - search data conditioning , prepared for planet transit search .",
    "+ these two columns were extracted from the fits file and flux values were converted from e-/s to magnitudes , using astropy     routines .",
    "all of the light curves were then cleaned using a dedicated program which runs a moving - average filter over the data and rejects the most obvious single outliers .",
    "the process was visually supervised to avoid the loss of some possible short planetary transits , as those would make themselves obvious in sc data as groups of low points .",
    "the cleaned sc data were fourier searched for the pulsational signals with highest amplitudes , which were then fit and subtracted from the light curve such that the prewhitened light curve could be inspected for transit - like events . this process was performed automatically and stopped either when no signal in the periodogram exceeded @xmath13 or when 60 frequencies had been prewhitened . at this point",
    "it was not important whether these signals were physical or not - the key was to remove the intrinsic variability to an extent that makes a search for transit - like signals possible .",
    "the search for transit signals was carried after each round of pulsation signal subtraction .",
    "initially , the fourier analysis and pre - whitening were performed for the full frequency range from 0 to 80 d@xmath5 . whenever this procedure did not yield satisfactory results ,",
    "e.g.   in case of low- and high - frequency signals of similar amplitude , two separate frequency ranges ( below 8 d@xmath5and from 8 to 80 d@xmath5 ) were sequentially analysed .",
    "even so , it was sometimes not possible to remove all the intrinsic variations , mostly because of unresolved close frequencies that resulted in artificially enhanced noise in the periodogram . in any case ,",
    "this approach was usually sufficient to remove the dominant components of the intrinsic variability and facilitate the search for transit - like signals . a possible `` comb '' of harmonic frequencies caused by transit - like signals in the periodogram would be interpreted by this program as an increase in noise level rather than individual oscillations and the automatic prewhitening would leave such structures unaffected .    the procedure for the transit search",
    "itself was inspired by the planet hunters project , i.e. all the light curves were first inspected visually .",
    "a preliminary pass , where the only selection criterion was the occurrence of dips of any kind ( not necessarily recurring ) , resulted in a list of 230 candidate stars .",
    "after a more careful inspection of those candidates , the list shrank to 81 . during that pass , obvious candidates with dips caused by instrumental effects were rejected ( e.g. dips occurring at the exactly same time during one quarter for separate stars ) .",
    "for the last sort , all the light curves were critically viewed and this resulted in 42 final candidates , listed in table  [ table : candidates ] .",
    "it is important to note that , in addition to this 42 candidates , a further 100 stars already marked as `` planetary candidates '' in the mast database were also recovered ( these stars are not listed here ) .",
    "a comparison of the list of our candidates and already known candidates in mast with the catalogue from @xcite shows that we recovered 106 candidates out of 130 which also appeared in @xcite .    of the final 42 candidates , only one showed periodic transit - like events .",
    "in some cases , the dips were not of a typical transit - like profile ( with a flat minimum ) , however , as transiting systems exist whose geometry does not generate flat minima in the light curves , we decided to not exclude those from our list .",
    "there are at least a few effects that can change the transit shape , e.g. asymmetric transit shapes due to the effects of stellar gravity darkening of a rapidly rotating , oblate host star @xcite .",
    "we caution that some of these events may not be real transits , but would rather be due to imperfectly removed pulsations mimicking a transit - like light curve shape .",
    "this , in turn , may offer an explanation for the candidates where we detect only single events .",
    "as such , we do not claim that all candidates here show true transits , but rather that they are worthy of more in - depth study .    for each of our 42 candidates ,",
    "long cadence data was also inspected .",
    "we normalised and merged the data , and calculated fourier spectra to search for harmonic frequencies of possible orbital frequencies .",
    "as transits generate nonsinusoidal variability , a fourier spectrum of such a light curve is expected to contain many harmonic frequencies with separations equal to the frequency of repeated transits .",
    "measurement of the separation of these harmonics gives an estimation of the corresponding period .    among the analysed candidates , only two showed clearly visible harmonics : kic 5613330 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:561pow_spec ] ) and kic 8197761 ( after prewhitening , fig .",
    "[ fig : power_spectrum ] ) . in the case of kic 5613330",
    ", the frequency of the transits determined using harmonics is @xmath14 d@xmath5(period of @xmath15 d ) .",
    "the light curve phased at this frequency is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:516transit ] .",
    "this planet candidate has been identified by the _ kepler _ pipeline as koi-649.01 with a period very close to our determination and later on validated as kepler-635b by ( * ? ? ? * with a period of @xmath16 d ) . however , as kic 5613330 did not show pulsational variability that could be used for further asteroseismological investigation , we focus on kic 8197761 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : spectra ]    all spectra were reduced using the dedicated ` hermes ` pipeline .",
    "radial velocity analysis was performed using the ` molly ` software package .",
    "barycentric corrections were applied to all spectra , before cross - correlating each against the first spectrum in the series ( dividing each spectrum into four pieces of equal wavelength range to aid the process computationally ) .",
    "the first spectrum was arbitrarily chosen as the template spectrum , which was deemed appropriate given that each spectrum had a similarly high signal - to - noise .",
    "it is important to note that by choosing one of the observed spectra as the template , we are unable to determine the systemic velocity of the binary rather only the variability ( as the template spectrum arbitrarily sets the zero against which all other velocities are measured ) .",
    "the resulting measurements are a weighted average of values obtained for each spectrum chunk , where weights were typical @xmath17 ( the standard deviation of the set of velocity measurements from all chunks of the spectrum ) .",
    "the  radial velocity  curve obtained this way was then fit with a sine function with fixed period - the orbital period of @xmath18 d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the photometric transit period is indeed the orbital period , and that the observed eclipses are only primary eclipses / transits .",
    "the rv curve is well fit with a sine function of amplitude @xmath19  km / s .",
    "@xcite derived a value consistent with ours from only two rv measurements .",
    "we checked the presence of a possible small orbital eccentricity in our radial velocity data , and determined a best - fitting value of @xmath20 .",
    "we consider this result as not significant at the time being and stay with the assumption of a circular orbit .",
    "the amplitude of the derived radial velocity curve , when combined with the mass estimate of the primary ( and assuming an orbital inclination of 90 ) results in a lower limit secondary mass of @xmath21 m@xmath22 .",
    "this mass would correspond to a mid - m dwarf , the typical radius of which would be @xmath90.3r@xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , accounting for this the eclipse duration implies an orbital inclination @xmath2385 . as such , the companion is not of planetary mass .",
    "we also determined the projected rotational velocity of kic 8197761 from our spectra . to this end",
    ", the individual spectra were shifted by the radial velocity offsets in table  [ table : spectra ] and then averaged . a synthetic spectrum for the star",
    "was then computed using the program ` spectrum ` @xcitegrayro / spectrum / spectrum.html ] and an atlas9 model atmosphere @xcite for @xmath24 k , log @xmath25=4.0 , @xmath26=0.0 $ ] , and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km / s .",
    "we broadened the synthetic spectrum with trial projected rotational velocities and the instrumental profile as determined from the telluric lines in the ` hermes ` spectra , and compared it with the observed average .",
    "the best fit was achieved with @xmath27 km / s .",
    "this value can still be affected by macroturbulence and pulsational line broadening . to estimate the latter ,",
    "we adapt the method and result by who computed the expected pulsational line broadening for another @xmath1 doradus star , kic 7661054 .",
    "these authors computed a line broadening of @xmath28 km / s as a result of the star s pulsation .",
    "as the photometric peak - to - peak amplitude of kic 8197761 is some 30% larger than that of kic 7661054 , we estimate the pulsational line broadening with @xmath29 km / s for our star . keeping in mind that all line broadening mechanisms add up as the sum of squares",
    ", pulsational line broadening would not alter our @xmath30 determination outside the quoted errors ; the same comment applies to macroturbulence up to 4 km / s .",
    "we therefore believe that our @xmath30 measurement corresponds to the real value within the errors .",
    "given the stellar radius in table  [ table : parameters ] , such a low rorational broadening would imply a rotation period @xmath31  d , markedly different from the rotation periods of the star photometrically determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is easily explained : both authors identified one of the stellar pulsation periods ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ) as a rotational signal .",
    "more interestingly , the ( surface ) rotation period determined here is very close to the system s orbital period , but much shorter than the rotation period determined from the frequency splittings of the g - mode pulsations .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the rotation of the envelope of kic 8197761 is synchronised with the orbit ( consistent with the circularised orbit found from the radial velocity curve ) , whereas the stellar core rotates 30 times slower than that .",
    "the goal of this work was to search for exoplanets around pulsating stars . given the large number of objects observed by _",
    "kepler _ and the quality of the associated data , it is only now possible to perform such a search .",
    "the stars for the search were taken from the mast archive within a given effective temperature range , in order to isolate probable pulsators .",
    "that resulted in 7546 individual fits files for a total of 2292 stars .",
    "the whole sample contained stars of different kinds of variability , e.g. @xmath2 scuti , @xmath1 doradus , rr lyrae , eclipsing binaries and more .",
    "the light curves were cleaned of isolated outlying points , and then prewhitened of signals found by fourier analysis .",
    "the residual light curves were inspected for the presence of transits three times following progressively stricter criteria , resulting in a list of transit candidates consisting of 42 stars .",
    "within the transit candidates there is only one , kic 8197761 , which shows exactly what was of interest in this work  transit - like events hidden in pulsations .",
    "a second star , kic 5613330 , showed periodic transit - like events but no intrinsic , pulsational variability .    for kic 8197761 , a careful examination of the pulsational signals revealed the presence of an equal frequency splitting of @xmath34 d@xmath5within some modes of oscillation .",
    "these modes were found to be rotationally split @xmath35 g modes of high radial order .",
    "the rotation period obtained using @xmath36 and in asymptotic limit is @xmath37 d. such a period is very long for a star as hot as a @xmath1 doradus star , however , it is such a slow rotation that favours the detection of rotational splitting signals .",
    "an attempt to perform asteroseismic modelling ( h. saio , private communication ) did not bear fruit .",
    "the eleven low - amplitude @xmath2 scuti pulsations detected did not allow to obtain additional seismic information .",
    "returning to the eclipses / transits , a v - like light curve shape is present , suggesting that this may be grazing event .",
    "in such an ambiguous case a mass estimation is crucial , but there were no such constraints in the literature .",
    "therefore , we attempted to estimate the mass using the ltte , by utilising pulsation frequencies stable in time to measure orbitally induced phase variations of these pulsations .    because there is no indication of the secondary eclipse / transit in the light curve",
    ", three possible scenarios were tested : two stars of equal mass , two stars of different mass and a  star and a planet .",
    "unfortunately , given the errors of the determinations of the ltte , only the first of these scenarios could be rejected .",
    "the rather long periods of @xmath1 doradus pulsations and their low amplitudes therefore make it difficult to detect planetary , and even low - mass stellar , companions around them using the ltte .    as a final step we performed a spectroscopic analysis of kic 8197761 .",
    "our 13 spectra obtained with ` hermes ` on the 1.2-m mercator telescope show radial velocity variations with an amplitude of @xmath7 km / s , and allowed the determination of @xmath27 km / s .",
    "the latter suggests that the surface rotation of the star is synchronized with the orbital period , although the stellar core rotates much slower .",
    "the estimated companion mass is @xmath10 m@xmath22 .",
    "based on this result we reject the hypothesis of the companion being an exoplanet .    the combination of asteroseismology and exoplanetary research results in multiple synergies .",
    "all the space missions designed to search for planets provide also excellent data to use for asteroseismic studies .",
    "asteroseismology plays a key role especially in characterisation of the host stars .",
    "for example for solar - like stars the radius , the mass , and the age can be estimated with remarkable precision ( of the order of a few percent , e.g. @xcite ) . in the future , this may serve as a key test of our stellar models and our understanding in stellar physics .",
    "another interesting question is the possible interaction(s ) between the exoplanets and host stars , which may play a role in some of the mysterious pulsational behaviour observed in some stars ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "recently , asteroseismic methods began to serve as another exoplanet detection method by measuring the delay in pulsation time arrivals , and the first such planet around an a - type star has been discovered ( @xcite ) . with the current and upcoming missions such as k2 , tess , or plato",
    ", this demonstrates how asteroseismology may aid to find and characterise exoplanets in the near future .",
    "these examples highlight that exoplanetary science would be less successful without asteroseismology and cooperation between both is required for a deep understanding of both stars and planets .",
