    "carbon chain molecules are often at the forefront in discussions of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dib ) ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , which are found mainly in the optical part of the spectrum ( herbig 1995 ) .",
    "they became more appealing candidates with the discovery at mm wavelengths @xcite of numerous polar carbon chains in dense interstellar clouds .",
    "however , only in the past few years have the gas phase electronic spectra of a number of such species ( e.g. c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 , c@xmath13h n=3 - 6 ) , as well of related cations ( e.g. hc@xmath13h@xmath14 n=2 - 4 , hc@xmath13n@xmath14 n=2 - 4 ) and anions ( e.g. c@xmath15",
    "n=3 - 11 ) been detected in the laboratory , enabling direct comparison with astronomical data ( for example , @xcite ) . in all cases where",
    "the comparisons could be made , the results were negative , leading to the conclusion that the column densities of these species are @xmath16 @xmath8 in diffuse clouds .",
    "however , with the detection of the rotational lines in the electronic transition of c@xmath5 near 4052  @xcite , corresponding to total column densities of 1 - 2@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 , and the prediction of certain models of such diffuse clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) that the abundances of c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 are less than a factor of ten smaller than that of c@xmath5 , it became appealing to search for these molecules .",
    "a disadvantage compared to the electronic spectrum of c@xmath5 is that , according to theoretical predictions , the oscillator strengths of the transitions appear to be smaller .",
    "unfortunately , experimentally determined oscillator strengths are unavailable .",
    "these smaller oscillator strengths result in higher abundance limits than was the case for c@xmath5 .",
    "apart from the abundances predicted for c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , the detection of both c@xmath5 and c@xmath1 in the infrared by @xcite in a circumstellar shell provides a guideline . in the latter work the concentration of c@xmath1 proved to be some ten times less than that of c@xmath5 .",
    "here we report an attempt to detect the origin bands of the electronic transitions of c@xmath0 ( @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ) at 3789  and of c@xmath1 ( @xmath20 @xmath18 @xmath21 ) at 5109  in absorption towards the reddened star @xmath2 oph ( hd 149757 ) with the gecko spectrograph of the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 m telescope .",
    "there is already one report in the literature of a non - detection of c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the present study is an order of magnitude more sensitive .",
    "there is no prior attempt reported to detect c@xmath0 in interstellar clouds , but the electronic spectrum in the gas phase was only obtained a year ago @xcite .",
    "the reddened star @xmath2 oph ( hd 149757 ) , was observed on 29 and 30 june 2001 ( ut ) with the gecko echellette spectrograph , fiber fed from the cassegrain focus of the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) @xcite .",
    "this star is bright , having a visual extinction , a@xmath22 , near 1 with a rich spectrum of sharp interstellar lines .",
    "@xcite has resolved the interstellar c@xmath23 at 8756  into two close velocity components separated by 1.1 km s@xmath24 which is hard to resolve at our resolution .",
    "the rapidly rotating star , @xmath25 uma ( hd 120315 ) was observed as standard .",
    "the detector was the rear illuminated eev1 ccd ( 13.5 @xmath26m@xmath27 pixels ) and the spectral regions were centered at 3789  in the 15th order , and at 5109  in the 11th order .",
    "the 15th order was isolated by the gecko ultraviolet grism , the 11th by the blue grism .",
    "individual spectra of @xmath2 oph were exposed for 15 minutes at 3789  and 6 minutes at 5109  .",
    "the feed fibre was continuously agitated to overcome modal noise ( see @xcite ) .",
    "lines in th / ar comparison arc spectra , taken before and after each set of stellar spectra , typically had fwhm of 3 pixels , corresponding to resolutions of @xmath28 = 115000 and 109800 at 3789 and 5109  , or 0.0109 and 0.0155  pxl@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "extensive series of flat - field spectra of a quartz - iodide lamp were recorded for each spectrograph setting and groups of biases were taken several times each night .",
    "conditions were not ideal to achieve the very high s / n ( @xmath294000 ) which we felt necessary to detect the c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 bands .",
    "only parts of two of the assigned nights were clear and the flat - field spectra displayed an unstable structure typical of modal noise .",
    "the stellar spectra did not show the same structure and we were able to demonstrate that the main fiber agitation was working as designed but a misalignment of the fiber feeding the the light of the flat field lamp to the main fiber may have caused the problem .",
    "for this reason a combination of flat fields and standard stellar spectra were used in the reduction .",
    "the many biases taken throughout the observing run were averaged to remove the zero - level offset in the spectra for both wavelength regions . for the 5109  spectra , obtained after the noise problem with the flat field exposures had been recognized , @xmath25 uma",
    "was observed at a s / n level substantially higher than @xmath2 oph . since the spectrum of the standard star is featureless near 5109  its spectrum was used in place of flat field spectra .",
    "unfortunately , at 3789  , weather constraints prevented observations of @xmath25 uma at a sufficient s / n level for them to be used directly as flat fields . instead , we averaged the flat field exposure to remove pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the spectra of both @xmath25 uma and @xmath2 oph . one dimensional spectra of both stars were then extracted in a standard manner . because of the modal noise in the flat field spectra , each flat field corrected stellar spectrum shows a residual low frequency modal noise pattern .",
    "we therefore smoothed the featureless , flat fielded spectrum of @xmath25 uma with a 10-point box car filter and then divided the @xmath2 oph spectrum by this smoothed spectrum to remove the modal noise residuals without seriously degrading the inherently high s / n of the @xmath2 oph spectrum . for clarity",
    "this reduction procedure is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "low - order polynomial fits to the positions of the th / ar arc spectra were used to calibrate the @xmath2 oph spectra in wavelength .",
    "the spectra were then normalized to the continuum and heliocentric corrections applied .",
    "the observations are summarised in table [ observations ] which lists exposure times and s / n per pixel for each spectral region .",
    "the final column gives the radial velocities of the interstellar k i 4044.1 and 4047.2  lines as quoted by @xcite .",
    "these velocities were applied to each spectrum to put the interstellar features on a laboratory scale before making the comparisons discussed in the next section .",
    "the comparisons are shown in figures 2 and 3 where the stellar spectra have been smoothed with a 3-pixel box car filter .",
    "the 3@xmath10 detection limits are derived from :    @xmath30    where the 3@xmath10 limiting equivalent width , @xmath31 , and the fwhm of the feature , @xmath32 , are both measured in  , the spectrograph dispersion , @xmath33 , in  pixel@xmath24 , and s / n is the signal to noise per pixel .",
    "we adopted @xmath32 = 0.24 and 0.13 for the 3789 and 5109  laboratory features , respectively .",
    "ccccccccc 11700 & 2300 & 0.67 & & 10800 & 2600 & 0.50 & & @xmath1814.53 @xmath340.18 +",
    "our attempt to detect the c@xmath0 3789  origin band of the known electronic systems in absorption through the diffuse cloud towards the reddened star @xmath2 oph was negative . in figure 2",
    "we compare the stellar spectrum with one from the laboratory @xcite recorded at a temperature of around 50 k. this temperature should be representative for a non - polar molecule in diffuse interstellar clouds ; in the case of c@xmath23 @xcite and c@xmath5 @xcite , comparable temperatures have been inferred .",
    "the laboratory spectrum ( which differs from the published one only in that the overlapping c@xmath23 lines have been removed ) shows that the rotational lines are lifetime broadened allowing only the lines in the p - branch to be resolved .",
    "the intense part of the band to the blue is the r - head and this feature was primarily sought in the astronomical spectrum .",
    "the 3@xmath10 upper limit for the equivalent width ( @xmath31 ) detection of the r - head is 0.67@xmath610@xmath35  .",
    "the upper limit to the column density @xmath36 can then be derived from :        though the @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 electronic transition of c@xmath0 has been observed in the gas phase , the oscillator strength @xmath38 is not known experimentally .",
    "two values from ab initio calculations are available which , however , differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "the first study yielded @xmath38=0.003 @xcite whereas the second gave f=0.0005 @xcite .",
    "the values are for the whole band system and thus the @xmath40 for the 3789  band will be reduced by the franck - condon factor for this transition . based on the intensity distribution of the vibrational bands observed in the absorption spectrum measured in a neon matrix @xcite",
    ", this may be a factor of 5 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath40 in the 0.0001 to 0.001 range leads to n(c@xmath0 ) @xmath41 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath42 @xmath8 .",
    "two more recent models of diffuse interstellar clouds ( of which the data have been made available to the authors ) with characteristics comparable to the one towards @xmath2 oph @xcite yield n(c@xmath5)/ n(c@xmath0 ) ratios of about 2 @xcite , and 13 @xcite .",
    "the detected total column density of c@xmath5 is 1.6@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , in view of the uncertainty in the oscillator strength , it is not possible to assess the predictive value of the models .",
    "the situation is similar for c@xmath1 .",
    "the band system with the 5109  origin band shown in figure 3 was observed first in absorption in a 5 k neon matrix @xcite and then in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "it was assigned as the @xmath20 @xmath18 @xmath21 electronic transition by analogy to the comet band system of c@xmath5 .",
    "the rotational structure is only partially resolved due to line widths of 0.7 cm@xmath24 ( homogeneous broadening due to intramolecular processes ) .",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath40 = 0.02 was estimated by taking the experimentally known value for c@xmath5 ( @xmath40 = 0.016 ) and scaling this up by the length of the molecule , as simple quantum models such as particle in a box predict .",
    "however , on the basis of recent theoretical calculations , it is proposed that the 5109  band system is in fact a forbidden transition , to @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 states @xcite .",
    "the oscillator strength could not be calculated because the vibronic effects which lead to its intensity would have to be correctly accounted for .",
    "there is another band system in the neon absorption spectrum with origin band at 4454  ( unpublished data from the laboratory at basel ) , which would then be the @xmath20 - @xmath21 electronic transition , with calculated oscillator strength of 0.03 @xcite ; an earlier f value for this transition was 0.037 @xcite .",
    "a pragmatic approach to the estimation of the oscillator strength for the 5109  band is to use the relative intensities of the absorption systems in the 5 k neon matrix .",
    "the 4454  absorption band system appears about a factor of 5 more intense than the 5109  one , implying an f value for the system of around 0.006 .",
    "the @xmath40 value for the 5109  band will then be reduced further by its franck - condon factor , to yield @xmath40 around 0.001 . the lower spectrum in figure 3",
    "is that recorded towards @xmath2 oph .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( 2600 ) is high , leading to a 3@xmath10 detection limit of 5@xmath610@xmath46  .",
    "as the laboratory spectrum corresponds to a temperature of around 50 k , about 10 rotational lines comprise the q - band head .",
    "this means that our astronomical measurements had a detection limit for an individual rotational line of @xmath47  . for a lower temperature of say , 10 k",
    ", there would still be some five lines unresolved within the band to give a 3@xmath10 limit per line of @xmath48  .",
    "our 3@xmath10 detetection limit of @xmath49  for the band , together with @xmath40 = 0.001 , leads to n(c@xmath1 ) @xmath42@xmath610@xmath11 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite recently reported a value of n(c@xmath1 ) @xmath50 @xmath8 , however the authors were unaware of the spectroscopic problems associated with the oscillator strengths and used a value of @xmath40 of 0.02 . taking the presently suggested @xmath40 = 0.001 increases their value to n(c@xmath1 ) @xmath4 2@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 , which is an order of magnitude less sensitive than our results .      according to the results reported here , n(c@xmath0 ) @xmath4 4@xmath610@xmath7 to 10@xmath42 @xmath8 , and n(c@xmath1 ) @xmath4 2@xmath610@xmath11 @xmath8 in the diffuse cloud towards @xmath2 oph , while n(c@xmath5 ) = 1.6@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 from the earlier study @xcite . from these column densities",
    "we calculate abundances relative to the total column density of hydrogen ( n(h ) + 2n(h@xmath23 ) ) , 1.3@xmath51 @xmath8 ( from table 2 of @xcite ) , of c@xmath5 = 2@xmath52 , c@xmath0 @xmath44@xmath52 to 10@xmath53 , and c@xmath1 @xmath4 2@xmath610@xmath53 . the results of the two diffuse cloud models to which we have access yield abundances which are too high for c@xmath5 by about an order of magnitude , 3@xmath610@xmath54 @xcite , and 5@xmath610@xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the values from the former model correspond to quasi steady state after 10@xmath55 years and the latter are for a@xmath3 = 1 and n= 500 cm@xmath24 chosen with depletions which provide a good fit for essentially all molecular species in translucent clouds and for the majority of species in diffuse clouds .",
    "similarly , the predicted abundances are also too high for the longer chains with relative values of c@xmath5:c@xmath0:c@xmath1 of 5:3:8 from @xcite , although @xcite gives 25:2:1 .",
    "so it appears that photodissociation rates have been underestimated ( or other depletion mechanisms such as electron attachment or absorption on grains need to be included ) .",
    "the upper limit we have obtained of 0.1 to the c@xmath1:c@xmath5 ratio is consistent with the result of infrared detection of both these species in a circumstellar shell with a ratio of 0.09 @xcite , suggesting that our measurements may have been close to actually detecting c@xmath1 .",
    "the detection of polyatomic species containing carbon atoms in diffuse and translucent interstellar clouds indicate comparable column densities , not larger than about 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath42 @xmath8 .",
    "this set comprises the detection of c@xmath5 in the optical region @xcite as well as of the rotational spectra of the polar species , c@xmath23h , c@xmath5h@xmath23 @xcite as examples .",
    "so far among polyatomic species only h@xmath56 has column densities in the diffuse medium exceeding 10@xmath57 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the implication of this for the search of appropriate molecular systems which could correspond to the stronger , narrower dibs , with typical equivalent widths of 0.1 a , is as follows .",
    "assuming that the species would have oscillator strengths of electronic transitions ( in the visible ) in the 1 - 10 range , as could be the case for carbon chains with 10 - 20 atoms , then the column density would have to be about 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "this column density could be easily attained by the larger carbon species , whatever their shape , because they are less efficiently photodissociated .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite that long carbon chain molecules , c@xmath58 ( @xmath59 = 5 - 15 ) be considered as the carriers of dibs , has now been tested directly for c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , showing that their abundance is too small .",
    "thus the next step in attempting to identify carriers of the dibs would be to obtain laboratory spectra of carbon species with 10 - 20 atoms having electronic transitions in the visible region ( e.g. , as is the case for c@xmath60 n=8 - 20 , @xcite ) and then making a direct comparison with astronomical observations at high s / n as has been demonstrated in this work .",
