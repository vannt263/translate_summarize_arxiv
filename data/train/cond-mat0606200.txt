    "this line of research seeks i m part to emulate the achievements of semiconductor materials researchers who have over the past few decades learned to engineer the electronic properties of epitaxially grown semiconductor materials by exploiting lattice - matching strains and modulation doping .",
    "because of the greater sensitivity of their electronic properties and because of the wider range of phenomena ( particularly magnetic phenomena ) that occur , the implications for physics and for technology of substantial advances in the oxide case are likely to be enormous . in anticipation of future progress on the materials side",

    "we find that strong correlations enhance the two - dimensional character of the metals that occur near modulation - doped heterojunctions and the range of doping which is possible without producing unwanted parallel conduction .",
    "we argue that two - dimensional electron systems produced in this way are likely to have remarkable properties and that modulation doping near interfaces between two - different mott insulators may make it possible not only to create weakly - disordered low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems , but also to engineer the compromises that occur in these systems between different types of magnetic order .    transition metal oxides are prototypical strongly - correlated - electron systems .",
    "understanding their electronic properties has been one of the most challenging topics in condensed matter theory .",
    "single - particle energy scales like the widths of bands near the fermi energy are often comparable to or smaller than characteristic interaction energy scales , challenging band theory descriptions .",
    "several different classes of transition metal oxides have been studied extensively revealing various interesting types of order involving spin , charge , and orbital degree of freedoms@xcite and leading to fundamental discoveries like high-@xmath0 superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance . in the last decade",

    "there have also been important advances in the theoretical description of artificially layered transition metal compounds .",

    "they concluded that the unusual metallic behavior observed by ohtomo _",
    "et al . _ originates at the mibi interface and that the properties of this interface are very different from those in the bulk , because of an _ electronic surface reconstruction _ reminiscent of the purely electronic@xcite reconstructions imposed by space - charge physics on systems with polar surface terminations@xcite .",

    "the discontinuity in bands at the interface is determined by atomic scale physics particular to an individual mimi heterojunction . in analogy with semiconductor heterostructure terminology",
    "we define the following classes of mimi heterojunctions : ( a ) type i : the hubbard gap of the smaller gap material is completely inside that of larger gap material . both electrons and holes",
    "can then be trapped near the heterojunction , depending on doping.(b ) type ii : the top of the lower hubbard band or the bottom of the upper hubbard band of the larger - gap material lies inside the hubbard gap of the smaller - gap material",

    "modulation doping of a mimi heterojuntion is achieved by doping the larger gap material at a spectator atom location that is removed from the heterojucntion .",
    "the extra electrons then enter the upper hubbard band of the lower gap mott insulator , creating a two - dimensional doped mott insulator that is trapped near the heterojunction by space charge electric fields . the spatial separation between dopants and the carriers that reside in the upper or lower hubbard bands",

    "tft yields accurate results for charge - density profiles and for the critical doping @xmath3 associated with the onset of parallel conduction .",
    "we conclude that both the doping fraction @xmath4 and the distance between the heterojunction and the doping layer play a role in the competition that occurs between different magnetically ordered states .    in the next section",

    "since the total number of electrons per unit cell is odd , compounds of this type must be mott - type when they are insulators , unless translational symmetries are broken .",
    "modulation doping is achieved by replacing some of the @xmath9 atoms in the larger gap insulator by elements with a different valence . in this paper",
    "we assume electron doping for convenience , although the hole doping case is completely equivalent , apart from ( important ! ) materials specific details which we do nt attempt to model in this qualitative study .",

    "the added electrons reside in the lower gap material , placing them some distance from the ionized donor atoms and reducing the importance of the chemical disorder normally associated with doping .    for this qualitative study",
    "we use a single - band hubbard model that ignores any orbital degeneracies that might be present .",
    "modulation - doping depends critically on the long - range coulomb interactions so these must be realistically represented in the model .",

    ", we ignore the possibility of a d - band offset between the two materials , although these will certainly occur in practice . given this assumption ,",
    "a type - i mimi heterojunction will occur whenever the hubbard @xmath28 parameter is large enough to produce insulating behavior in both materials .",
    "we consider a system with a finite number @xmath29 of layers labeled sequentially from left to right and define @xmath30 for @xmath31 to @xmath11 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 to @xmath29 with @xmath34 so that the larger gap material is on the left .",
    "we treat the coulomb part of the interactions in a mean - field hartree approximation .",
    "since coulomb potentials in the absence of doping are implicitly included in the model band hamiltonian , in evaluating this potential we include only the extra charges in the dopant layer and charges due to occupancy of lower or upper hubbard bands . to be specific , the reference background has charge per atom equal to @xmath35 for each @xmath12 site and @xmath36 for each @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 site . as a result ,",
    "the mean - field long - ranged coulomb interaction is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron density on site @xmath39 .",
    "in hft the strong on - site coulomb interactions is also treated in a mean - field approximation so that @xmath40 hft is equivalent to minimizing the microscopic hamilton in the space of slater - determinant wavefunctions . as noted@xcite",
    "previously there are typically a number of self - consistent solutions of the hf equations , corresponding to a number of local minima of the hartree - fock energy functional .",
    "the various minima usually are distinguished by different types of magnetic order .",
    "our philosophy in examining several different solutions without strong emphasis on their relative hf energies is that different types of order will occur near different interfaces but neither the single - band hubbard model nor any of the electronic structure approximations we consider ( or indeed any known electronic structure approximation ) is sufficiently reliable to confidently select between them .",
    "indeed phase transitions between mott insulator states with magnetic order and paramagnetic metallic phases , corresponding to magnetic and non - magnetic extrema of the hartree - fock energy functional , are often first order .",
    "( we will however make some conclusions of a more qualitative nature concerning trends and tendencies related to modulation doping . ) as explained more fully below , we find that the hft electron density distribution near a mimi heterostructure is sensitive mainly to the relative orientations of electron spins on neighbouring metal sites on adjacent layers .",
    "consequently , we present results only for usual bipartite antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) states , which in this respect cover the two possibilities .",

    "[ fig : three ] that the modulation doping effect occurs for both afm and fm states , although the details of the electron density distributions are quite different in the two cases .",
    "short - range correlations therefore appear to play a relatively strong role in determining the charge distribution near mimi heterostructures , in contrast to the mibi heterojunction case in which they play@xcite a relatively minor role .",
    "the upper hubbard band electrons are noticeably more confined to the interface in the afm state case and spread further into the smaller - u layer in the fm state case .",
    "this difference in density - distribution follows from a corresponding difference in the compromise between band - energy minimization and interaction energy minimization in the two - cases .",
    "the ferromagnetic state which has all spins parallel maximizes the hopping amplitudes between sites , doing a better job of minimizing band energy at a cost in interaction energy .",
    "the bandwidth of the mean - field quasiparticle states is @xmath44 for fm states and @xmath45 for afm states .",
    "increased doping should favor fm states over afm states , at least within hf theory . from a real - space point of view",
    ", doping frustrates the staggered moment order of the afm state more strongly than it frustrates the fm order because of the nearest - neighbor hopping term @xmath46 . in other words",
    ", doping favors the fm state over the afm state .",
    "the doped electrons have a strong tendency to accumulate nearly completely in one layer in the afm state case .",
    "larger setback distances for the dopant layer should result in larger space - charge fields at the heterojunction and less opportunity for electrons to spread out away from the interface , robbing the ferromagnetic state of the extra stability that it gains from the third dimension .",
    "we expect therefore that for a given doping level @xmath8 , antiferromagnetism will be favored by a larger setback distance for the dopants .",
    "a larger setback distance also favors the development of parallel conduction channel .",
    "these trends can be seen in the ground - state phase diagram plotted in fig .  [ fig : four ] . in summary ,",

    "the local - density approximation for correlations implicit in the thomas - fermi theory is obviously least reliable in judging the relative chemical potentials for adding carriers to spatially separate layers .",
    "the discrepancy also occurs partly because the long - ranged coulomb interaction was evaluated using a three - dimensional lattice version in the microscopic hft whereas a continuum approximation for the layers was used in the tft calculations .",
    "we expect that the tft model is too simplified to determine the critical doping for parallel conduction @xmath3 accurately for any particular heterojunction , but it may be used to analyze trends . the most important consequence of strong local interactions in the hubbard model is the emergence of a jump in the chemical potential when the electron density per site crosses from less than one to more than one . as illustrated in fig .",

    "indeed , we find that the magnetic phase diagram can be altered not only by the dopant density @xmath4 but independently by the dopant layer setback distance . unlike the case of mibi heterostructures in which the coulomb field dominates , the growth direction electron density distribution in mimi heterojunction systems also depends strongly on the character of in - plane ordering . in the afm state electrons",
    "are more confined to the interface while in the fm state electrons spread further away from the heterojunction into the smaller gap material .",
    "the results of hft can be reproduced remarkably well by thomas - fermi theory , indicating that the electrostatic energy and the correlation energy resulting from local fluctuations dominate the physics of the heterostructure . from the tf equation",
    ", we estimate the critical doping @xmath3 at which modulation doping starts to fail .",
    "dmft calculations show that modulation doping can occur without magnetic order , and that it requires only the on - site correlations that lead to the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "layer - dependent spectral functions calculated using dmft indicate that only the interface layer is metallic , reminiscent to the earlier findings of okamoto _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "doped mott insulators typically appear to have exotic properties when the doping is small and more conventional properties when the doping is large and the total band filling is well away from one , the value at which local correlations have maximum importance . in the case of the",
    "extremely heavily studied cuprate systems , for example , this crossover is interrupted , by high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether or not the two - dimensional electron systems considered in this paper are fermi liquids .",
    "whereas bulk doping often leads eventually to a first order transitions between a doped mott insulator and a relatively conventional metal , modulation doping in a single or several layers may make it possible to realize high - density , low - disorder , two - dimensional exotic metals which carry reflect the heritage of the three - dimensional mott insulators from which they emerge .",
    "since the very existence of these two - dimensional electronic systems depends on gaps that are entirely due to electron - electron interactions , it is clear that they can not be adiabatically connected to non - interacting electron states . on the other hand , in the hft description the doped state _",
    "is _ a fermi liquid with well defined quasiparticles .",
    "this approximation neglects quantum fluctuations of the magnetic state however , and its predictions for quasiparticle properties may not be reliable .    we have also speculated briefly on materials combinations that might be attractive to realize the physics discussed in this paper .",
    "predictions of the phase diagram for particular materials combinations will require much more detailed modeling , and may be assisted by insights from experiment as well as from _ ab initio _ electronic structure@xcite calculations .",
    "a detailed description would require many realistic features of perovskite materials to be addressed , for instance lattice distortions@xcite which may vary with proximity to the interface , and related orbital degeneracy issues .",
    "progress will require progress in materials growth and characterization and interplay with _ ab initio _ and phenomenological modelling .",
    "this work was supported by the welch foundation .",
    "the authors acknowledge helpful discussions with bernhard keimer , karin rabe , george sawatzky , david singh , and john goodenough .",
