    "`` _ _ computer trials indicate that in the range @xmath1 , the number of distinct configurations associated with each value of n grows exponentially , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "if this trend is sustained for larger values of @xmath0 , identifying global minima among a large set of nearly degenerate states for complex systems of this type will pose formidable technical challenges . _ _ '' t. erber and g. hockney  @xcite    for a natural number @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath3 any configuration of @xmath0 distinct points on @xmath4 . for a non - negative number @xmath5",
    ", one can ask what configuration minimizes the energy @xmath6 for @xmath7 this is known as the thomson problem  @xcite . at first glance this problem seems remarkably simple , yet there is not a simple solution .",
    "in fact , smale has identified a variant of this problem as worthy of focus for this century  @xcite .",
    "the current theoretical progress is limited .",
    "it is known that for any @xmath0 and @xmath5 a globally minimal configuration exists .",
    "for a few special cases of @xmath0 and @xmath5 there are rigorous proofs that certain configurations are globally minimal . finally , there are some asymptotic estimates for the minimal energy as a function of @xmath0 . in this last category plya and szeg",
    "@xcite , using measure - theoretic arguments , established some elegant estimates when @xmath5 is less than the dimension of the set on which the problem is posed , e.g. , @xmath8 in the case of @xmath4 ( also cf .",
    "landkof  @xcite ) .",
    "hardin and saff  @xcite , and borodachov , hardin and saff  @xcite established similar results when @xmath5 is greater than or equal to the dimension of the set in question .",
    "while theoretical progress is difficult , the analyticity of @xmath9 makes this an inviting problem for numerical optimization , particularly gradient - based optimizations .",
    "work in this area goes back to at least 1977  @xcite , and there are two efforts that particularly motivated this current effort .",
    "the first is erber s and hockney s reports and commentary  @xcite on computational experiments for the thomson problem for @xmath0 up to 65 and @xmath0 up to @xmath10 , where they provide some initial estimate for the growth in the number of stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this work also includes estimates for the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion for the minimal energy .",
    "the first term is in agreement with the earlier work of plya and szeg , and the second term was later identified in a formal conjecture by kuijlaars and saff  @xcite and later generalized to a large class of two - manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the second effort is the work by wales and ulker  @xcite , and the work by wales , mckay and altschuler  @xcite that led to the cambridge cluster database , which reports , for many @xmath0 and @xmath7 , the lowest known energy for the thomson problem .",
    "a significant challenge for numerical optimization is that many configurations are locally minimal , i.e. stable , with respect to @xmath11 , but not globally minimal .",
    "this motivated us to attempt to answer the question : how many stable configurations for a given @xmath0 and @xmath5 are there ?",
    "an earlier work that answers a similar question is that of hoare and mcinnis , who identify the distinct stable clusters of modest numbers of point - particles interacting through lennard - jones and morse potentials  @xcite . for the lennard - jones potential",
    "the number of stable clusters grew rapidly .",
    "the present work estimates this growth for the generalized thomson problem for @xmath0 up to @xmath12 and for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath8 , and @xmath15 , and reports some methods we found useful .",
    "a central question is whether the number of distinct local minima within the energy landscape grows exponentially with the number of points .",
    "stillinger and weber present the following informal argument suggesting an affirmative answer  @xcite . if one can convert one stable configuration into another with changes that are localized in space to within a fixed number nearest neighbor lengths , then , as the number of points grows , so should the number of available independent changes , and the number of stable configurations grows will grow exponentially . if the number of stable configurations does not increase exponentially with @xmath0 , then this would suggest that changes from one stable configuration to another can not be accomplished with only localized changes .",
    "our work began by generating a large library of stable configurations , and we describe our methods in section  [ sec : generate_stable ] . in doing this , we found that our optimization program would find rotations and reflections of the same stable configuration . in response",
    ", we used graph - isomorphisms of the delaunay triangulation as a means to recognize quickly a particular stable configuration .",
    "this method accelerated our work considerably , but there are some subtle ways it can fail .",
    "in particular we found two distinct stable configurations whose delaunay triangulations share the same graph structure .",
    "this is described in section  [ sec : graph_iso ] .",
    "even after months of numerical experiments running on many compute cores , the fraction of the most recent experiments that generated new configurations never dropped to zero , making it clear that there are many stable configurations we did not see .",
    "the problem of estimating the number of configurations we did nt see is an example of the broader `` unseen species '' problem , which arises in many settings such as linguistics and ecology .",
    "we apply a method developed partly by linguists to provide estimates in section  [ sec : unseen ] for the actual number of stable configurations .",
    "we used an iterative unconstrained optimization strategy described in section iii.a of our prior work@xcite to generate candidate stable configurations .",
    "the method consists of non - linear conjugate gradient ( nlcg ) with line minimization and , when that method no longer made progress , newton s method .",
    "our experience is that nlcg with line minimization was most effective up until near the end of the optimization .",
    "near the end of the optimization calculation , presumably when the configuration is at a point where the objective function @xmath11 is locally quadratic , newton s method would often make progress when nlcg could not .",
    "when computing the energy , @xmath16 , one has roughly @xmath17 summands that vary widely in range , and a direct summation can lead to roundoff errors .",
    "we controlled for this error by logarithmically binning our summands and only adding the content from the same bin .",
    "this allowed us to ensure that we never added two numbers whose ratio was more than two or less than one half , until the end when we summed the contents of the bins from lowest to highest .",
    "because we could bound the error for summation in a given bin , and because we could count the number of summations in the bin , we were able to estimate the error in our sums .",
    "this approach follows the work of higham  @xcite and demel and hida  @xcite .",
    "given a candidate stable configuration , we use the criteria described in section iii.b of a previous publication  @xcite to test for stability .",
    "the central assumption in this criteria is that our iterative optimization strategy will produce a candidate configuration @xmath18 that is close enough to an actual stable configuration @xmath19 , so that the gradient at @xmath19 , which is zero , may be expressed as a linear expansion of the gradient about @xmath18 .",
    "that is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the gradient and the hessian respectively of the objective function with respect to the @xmath23 angular free parameters .",
    "if this approximation were exact , it would allow us to bound the term @xmath24 , where subtraction is applied to the @xmath23-dimensional space of configurations .",
    "conceptually the calculation is @xmath25 @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the unnormalized two - norm allowing the bound of the infinity - norm .",
    "the hessian is not invertible , however . for our choice of coordinates",
    "there are three rotations of the sphere that do not change the relative distance between the points and hence do nt change the energy . while there are choices of coordinates free of such rigid rotations , those coordinate systems degraded the performance of nlcg .",
    "consequently the three lowest eigenvalues of the hessian are zero .",
    "the gradient has no projections along the corresponding eigenvectors , and we may choose a rotation of @xmath19 so that the difference @xmath24 similarly does not project along these eigenvectors .",
    "we let @xmath28 denote the fourth lowest eigenvector of the hessian and then we have @xmath29 change in angle on the sphere bounds from above change in position , and so @xmath30 provides a bound on the distance between corresponding points in the configurations @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "our criteria for stability is that @xmath31 which , in conjunction with the assumption that error in the approximation in eq .",
    "is negligible , leads to the conclusion that no point in @xmath18 is further from the corresponding point in @xmath19 by more than one ten - thousandth the minimum pairwise separation of the points in @xmath18 . an important consequence of this is that if two configurations satisfy eq .  , and",
    "if there is a rotation and reflection that aligns them to within one five - thousandth of both of their minimum pairwise distances , then , we say that they are instances of the same stable configuration .",
    "as previously noted  @xcite this criteria relies on bounding the infinity - norm with the unnormalized @xmath8-norm .",
    "such a bound is tight only when all the components except one are zero .",
    "the implication is that the maximum difference between a point in our candidate configuration and a true stable configuration is likely considerably less than one ten - thousandth of the minimum pairwise separation of the points within the configuration in question . for candidate configurations that we believed were instances of the same stable configuration",
    ", we could often align them to greater accuracy .",
    "the condition in eq   is a useful , reasonably motivated , heuristic for marking a configuration as stable .",
    "more rigorous bounds would require estimating the error in eq .  .",
    "since the energy @xmath11 depends only on the distances between points , it is invariant under isometry .",
    "however , that two configurations of points have the same energy does not ensure that there is an isometry between the two configurations . with this in mind we only called two configurations the same if we could find an isometry that mapped one configuration onto the other to within the tolerances described in the previous section .",
    "this leaves the question of how to search for an isometry between two configurations of similar energy , which we ll denote here as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "a simple approach is to apply algorithm  [ alg : simple ] described in this manuscript . while there are some optimizations such as , at line 5 , first testing that @xmath34 , this algorithm is expensive and must be applied to every pair of configurations with similar energy .",
    "we found a more effective algorithm was to look for isomorphisms between the graphs formed from the extremal edges in the delaunay triangulations of the configurations in question . for brevity we shall refer to this as an extremal triangulation .",
    "essentially we are looking at the edges in the set of triangles that make up the surface of the smallest polyhedron containing a configuration , @xmath35 .    to compute the extremal triangulation we used the qhull software package  @xcite .",
    "one immediate observation was that certain configurations did not have unique extremal triangulations , for example , the configuration with the lowest observed energy for @xmath36 and @xmath7 , shown in figure  [ fig : sph24 ] .",
    "the four points displayed toward the middle of the image are the vertices of a square , and either diagonal can be part of a valid extremal triangulation . because there can be degenerate extremal triangulations , the assumption that distinct extremal triangulations indicate non - isometric configurations is not , in general , correct .",
    "a simple test for non - degeneracy is to compute the set of unit normal vectors for the extremal faces , and to make sure that the dot - product of any two is bounded away from one .",
    "this is one of many possible extremal triangulations for this configuration of @xmath37 points.,height=264 ]    in the case that a configuration has a non - degenerate extremal triangulation , the edges of the triangulation and the points in the configuration form a graph , and this graph is invariant under rotation and reflection of the underlying configuration . in the degenerate case ,",
    "a rotation or reflection may lead qhull , due to round - off errors , to find a different , but equally valid , extremal triangulation .      a graph on a sphere is a planar graph in that , by choosing one face to be mapped to the unbounded component of the plane , the graph can be mapped onto the plane . in doing this the edges that bound this face are retained , and the graph structure is preserved whether the graph is embedded on @xmath4 or @xmath38 .",
    "there are efficient algorithms to determine isomorphisms of planar graphs and we use one following the work of lins  @xcite .",
    "the approach is to generate a tag for each graph with the property that two graphs are isomorphic if , and only if , the two tags are the same . the cost for finding isomorphisms between @xmath39 instances of graphs , or for finding isometries between @xmath39 configurations , can be written as @xmath40 in our approach @xmath41 is the cost of a searching for matching tags , i.e. string comparisons , while @xmath42 is the cost of generating the tag . for large @xmath39 ,",
    "this has substantial benefits , over the case that @xmath42 is zero , but @xmath41 is the cost associated with algorithm  [ alg : simple ] .",
    "the specific method we use for generating a tag is given in algorithm  [ alg : tag ] .",
    "we denote our graph as a set of vertices @xmath43 and a set of edges @xmath44 , and for any @xmath45 we denote by @xmath46 the set of edges that have @xmath47 as an endpoint . to each vertex",
    "@xmath47 we assign a natural number @xmath48 .",
    "the central idea in algorithm  [ alg : tag ] is to search for the lexically lowest encoding of a representation of the connectivity matrix , where we are searching over a set of possible orderings of vertices .",
    "we used an md5 hash of the connectivity matrix simply to use less memory .",
    "the requirement that the graph be planar is what allows us to generate the unique ordering of @xmath49 at line twelve .",
    "we stored the configuration with the ordering of points that generated the lexically lowest encoding , i.e. the tag .",
    "when we generated a new stable configuration for a given @xmath0 and @xmath5 we would , when the new configuration had a non - degenerate extremal triangulation , also generate the associated tag .",
    "we would then collect the already generated configurations for that @xmath0 and @xmath5 whose energies were close to the energy of the newly generated configuration . within the subset of these with unique extremal triangulations",
    ", we would search for the tag associated with the new configuration .",
    "if we found it , then because we stored the configurations with the orderings of points that generated the tag , we knew the rotation and reflection necessary that would be the isometry .",
    "it was our experience that , when there was an isometry , this method found it immediately .",
    "further , it was our experience that almost all of the configurations had non - degenerate extremal triangulations .    if we did not find matching tags , then we used algorithm  [ alg : simple ] to search for an isometry between the newly generated configuration and the existing configurations with similar energies .",
    "we only characterized a configuration as new for a given @xmath0 and @xmath5 if every configuration with that @xmath0 and @xmath5 had an energy that was sufficiently different to ensure that there was no isometry or that the application of algorithm  [ alg : simple ] did not find an isometry .",
    "the graph - isomorphism technique sped the process of finding isometries when they existed , but it was never used by itself to determine if a configuration was new or isometric to an existing one .",
    "there are two reasons why one should not rely exclusively on isomorphisms of non - degenerate extremal triangulations .",
    "the first is that it is possible , although we did nt see this case , that the graph has a non - trivial automorphism , but that the associated mapping of points is not a self - isometry .",
    "put another way , there may be two orderings of the points that lead to the same lexically minimal tag .",
    "an indication of this would be that , at line twenty - two of algorithm  [ alg : tag ] , tag was not none and @xmath50 , but , that there is no isometry between the configurations that preserves the orderings of points .",
    "an extremely simple example is a triangle where no two sides have the same length .",
    "it has no self - isometries , but six graph - automorphisms . also , there is the remote possibility for collisions in the md5 algorithm .",
    "the more significant reason that graph isomorphisms alone are not sufficient to identify stable configurations is that we found two distinct configurations that both have non - degenerate extremal triangulations , but whose graphs were isomorphic . for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the configurations with the fourth and fifth lowest energy have non - degenerate extremal triangulation with isomorphic graphs .",
    "the dual graphs , i.e. the voronoi cells , are shown in figure  [ fig : n102_s2 ] .",
    "the difference in energy is substantially more than the estimated error in the energy sums .",
    "the energies are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : simple ] did not identify an isometry .",
    "further , out of thousands of computer trials , we reproduced the fourth lowest configuration @xmath55 times and the fifth lowest configuration @xmath56 times  these were not rare configurations .     on",
    "the left is the configuration with the fourth lowest energy for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , on the right is the configuration with the fifth lowest energy .",
    "they have the non - degenerate extremal triangulation with isomorphic graphs , but are distinct stable configurations .",
    "the dark ( blue in the online version ) cell has seven edges , two of which in the upper left and lower left are extremely short .",
    "the reader will notice that these two edges differ in the image on the left and the right.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   on the left is the configuration with the fourth lowest energy for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , on the right is the configuration with the fifth lowest energy .",
    "they have the non - degenerate extremal triangulation with isomorphic graphs , but are distinct stable configurations .",
    "the dark ( blue in the online version ) cell has seven edges , two of which in the upper left and lower left are extremely short .",
    "the reader will notice that these two edges differ in the image on the left and the right.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]",
    "after months of running on many compute cores , we found that for most @xmath0 between @xmath57 and @xmath12 the rate at which we discovered new stable configurations was still far from zero .",
    "we took this as an indication that more trials would result in more distinct stable configurations , and that we had not seen all of them . in response",
    ", we aimed to estimate the number of stable configurations that we did nt see in our trials .",
    "such an estimate can not be made without additional assumptions , which we shall make clear as we proceed .",
    "there is some precedent for trying to estimate the number of unseen species .",
    "for example , efron and thisted estimated the number of words shakespeare knew  @xcite , although their approach is more sophisticated than ours .    in broad terms",
    "our approach is as follows : we first compute the good - turing frequency described below .",
    "this is an estimate for the combined probability of all the configurations we did not see .",
    "in addition this method produces estimated probabilities for the @xmath58 stable configurations we did see , @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that when these estimated probabilities are sorted in decreasing order the tail has a certain analytic form , i.e. that there is a @xmath60 so that @xmath61 for large @xmath62 .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 from the data , and use it to compute how many more configurations we would need for the sum of the probabilities of those unseen configurations to agree with the good - turing frequency .",
    "the first assumption is that the number of stable configurations is finite . while this seems intuitively true , the function @xmath63 for @xmath64 and 0 for @xmath65 has infinitely many local minima on the closed unit interval , indicating that a proof that there are finitely many stable configurations will depend on domain specific information .",
    "a second assumption is that , were we to use a different gradient based optimization technique , the estimated probabilities for configurations we observed would nt be so different as to change dramatically the estimates for the unseen species . while we have no proof , our instincts are that the basins of attraction for gradient descent methods all are qualitatively the same , and that the initial random configurations were sufficiently disordered so as not to be `` nearer '' a particular subset of stable configurations .",
    "indeed , efforts to avoid the preponderance of stable configurations while searching for the global minimum has lead researchers away from purely gradient - based methods such as the work by morris , deavon and ho  @xcite , and the work by lakhab and bernoussi  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly summarize i. j. good s description of the good - turing estimate  @xcite .",
    "suppose we perform @xmath66 trials where we observed some number of distinct species ",
    "stable configurations in our case .",
    "we let @xmath67 denote the number of species that we observed @xmath68 times , and so @xmath69 we then ask , for a species that we saw @xmath68 times , what is a reasonable estimate for the fraction of the population that consists of that species ?",
    "the most straightforward estimate , @xmath70 , has the drawback that the sum of the fractions is one , i.e. this estimates assumes that there were no unseen species .",
    "this is almost certainly wrong in our case . if the likelihood of seeing each species is described by a binomial distribution , which is reasonable in our case , good arrives at the following estimate  ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) for the probability of a species that was observed @xmath68 times @xmath71 here , in a slight abuse of notation , @xmath72 indicates the expectation value for the number of species that we would expect to see @xmath68 times in @xmath66 trials . to be applicable , good makes the following approximation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the smoothed number of species seen @xmath68 times .",
    "the need for smoothing arises because at large @xmath68 , i.e. for species that occurred many times , the discreteness of the measurement @xmath67 within @xmath66 trials becomes apparent .",
    "gale and sampson provide a method , which we used , for smoothing the data  @xcite .",
    "figures 1 and 2 in that publication make clear the need for , and effect of , smoothing .",
    "the result is the following estimate for the probability of a species ( configuration ) that occurred @xmath68 times in @xmath66 trials  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eqs . 2 and 2 )",
    "@xmath75 the estimated probability of all species that occurred @xmath68 times , denoted @xmath76 , is @xmath77 summing these estimated probabilities over all observed species  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7,8 ) gives @xmath78 if the smoothing process is performed so that eq",
    ".   holds with @xmath67 replaced with @xmath74 , then the combined probability of all of our observed species is given by @xmath79 and so the estimate for the probability of the unseen species is @xmath80     this plot shows the estimated probability for all of the observed configurations , ordered in decreasing probability.,height=340 ]     this plot shows the smoothed estimated probability for all of the observed configurations.,height=340 ]    this method gives us estimated probabilities for each of the configurations we have observed . for @xmath81 and @xmath82 we show these estimated probabilities in figure  [ fig : unsmoothed ] .",
    "the stair - step nature for the low estimated probabilities is an artifact of the finite number of samples .",
    "the estimated probability for a configuration depends only on the number of times the configuration occurred .",
    "this number can only be @xmath83 .",
    "gale and sampson s smoothing technique addresses a similar problem , in that the observed values of @xmath67 for large @xmath68 must also be integral .",
    "we use a simple smoothing technique where , for a given probability , we take the geometric mean of the first and last configuration number as an estimate for the configuration number where that probability would occur .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : smoothed ] .",
    "we fit @xmath84 to the log - log tail of these data excluding the point corresponding to the configurations that occurred once .",
    "we are operating on two assumptions here : first , the tail of the probability distribution can be approximated @xmath85 , and second , that the last point in figure  [ fig : smoothed ] is not `` below '' the fit line , as much as it is `` to the left '' of the fit line .",
    "that is to say , for this sample , we believe that many more unseen configurations whose probability is close to @xmath86 than there are unseen configurations whose probability is close to or higher than @xmath87 .     the number of observed distinct stable configurations and estimates for the total number of distinct stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath13.,height=340 ]     the number of observed distinct stable configurations and estimates for the total number of distinct stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath7.,height=340 ]     the number of observed distinct stable configurations and estimates for the total number of distinct stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath52.,height=340 ]     the number of observed distinct stable configurations and estimates for the total number of distinct stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath82.,height=340 ]    another statement of this assumption is that nearly all the unseen configurations have probability less than @xmath87 , but not necessarily less than @xmath86 .    with this in mind",
    "we solve the following for @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the estimated combined probability of all the species we did nt see , @xmath86 is the estimated probability for the species we saw once , @xmath91 is the number of species that we saw once , and @xmath92 is the number of configurations we saw at least twice .",
    "note that we are only guaranteed to get a value of @xmath88 if @xmath93 .",
    "when we apply this method we get an estimate for the total number of stable configurations .",
    "these estimates as a function of @xmath0 are plotted in figures  [ fig : estimated_stable_count_s0 ] , [ fig : estimated_stable_count_s1 ] , [ fig : estimated_stable_count_s2 ] and [ fig : estimated_stable_count_s3 ] for @xmath94 and @xmath15 respectively . in these figures",
    "we ve only plotted results where the error was less then the value itself .",
    "if these estimates for the number of stable configurations are reasonable , and if the growth in the number of stable configurations is exponential , then fits from @xmath95 for the number of stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath5 indicate that the number of stable configurations as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by @xmath99    if we perform a similar fit to the number of observed configurations for @xmath7 , as opposed to the number of estimated configurations , we obtain @xmath100 , which is similar to erber s and hockney s estimate of @xmath101 noted above .",
    "this growth is considerably slower than the growth in the estimated number of stable configurations , which we feel is likely closer to the actual growth in the number of stable configurations .",
    "when searching for isomorphisms between a set of configurations of points on a sphere , the use of a simple invariant under isometry , the discrete energy @xmath11 , quickly filtered out many configurations as not - isometric .",
    "after this a more comprehensive invariant under isometry , the graph of non - degenerate extremal triangulations , was extremely effective .",
    "it is reasonable to express concern over the number of assumptions and over the sensitivity of @xmath102 in eq .   to the other parameters .",
    "the defensible conclusion is that there are substantially more stable configurations than those we observed , and just as performing enough trials to observe the configuration with the lowest energy is a formidable technical challenge , so too is finding all the stable configurations .",

    "<S> this led the authors of this manuscript to the question , how many stable configurations are there ? in this manuscript we report methods for identifying and counting observed stable configurations , and estimating the actual number of stable configurations . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates indicate that for @xmath0 approaching two hundred , there are at least tens of thousands of stable configurations . </S>"
