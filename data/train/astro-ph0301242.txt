    "mass density profiles of galaxies and clusters of galaxies play a central role in the study of the intrinsic properties of these systems as well as in models of their formation , evolution , and their use as probes of the mass density of the universe .",
    "the formation of cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos has been studied extensively over the years .",
    "considerable theoretical work has been done to describe the shape of dm profiles , mostly by numerical simulations ( , suto 2002 ) .",
    "early attempts were severely limited in predicting the profile in the central region due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "recent improvements in numerical techniques led to the attainment of high central resolution ( @xmath2 kpc ) in the dynamical simulation of dm profiles . however , a realistic description of the distribution of dm and gas in the central cluster regions necessitates a coupled dynamical and hydrodynamical simulation that can follow the evolution of dm and gas under their mutual interactions . in particular , heating and cooling processes in",
    "the gas can occur on timescales which are shorter than the hubble time with possible ramifications also for the dm profile .",
    "based on large , n - body simulations of the evolution of dm configurations , navarro , frenk & white ( hereafter nfw , 1995 , 1997 ) showed that cdm density profiles are independent of the halo mass , and can be accurately fit over a large range of sizes by a simple algebraic form which is said to be universal ( but see jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "the proposed nfw profile has a cusp - like @xmath3 behavior close to the center , and an asymptotic @xmath4 falloff at large @xmath5 .",
    "it has been argued that dm profiles may even exhibit a steeper inner cusp ; for example , moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) claimed that high resolution simulations indicate that the central profile is @xmath6 .",
    "an uninterrupted steep rise of the density towards the center is clearly unphysical , and such a characterization could be due to insufficient level of spatial resolution in the numerical simulations , other important factors in the simulations ( such as the particular choice of initial conditions , e.g. , bartschiger & labini 2001 ) , or a result of physical limitations in the description of the cluster density over small ( o[10 kpc ] ) , typically _ galactic _ scales .",
    "that the latter are perhaps the more likely reasons is indicated by even a steeper inner cusp that is deduced in recent ( governato et al .",
    "2001 ) higher resolution simulations .",
    "even the improved hydrodynamical simulations do not include all the relevant physical processes that could affect the nature of the deduced mass profiles .",
    "for example , it is clear that the properties of intracluster ( ic ) gas , whose fractional contribution to the total mass is @xmath7 , must play some role in the determination of the density profile .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of the central regions of a few nearby clusters have not ( yet ) provided unequivocal evidence on the shape of the central dm profile .",
    "strong evidence was found for a flat profile in the central region of abell 1795 ( ettori 2002 ) , a behavior similar to the trend seen in observations in some galaxies ( mainly low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "but there is also evidence for a central cusp in the clusters abell 2029 ( lewis et al 2002 ) , hydra a ( david 2001 ) , and emss 1358 ( arabadjis 2002 ) .",
    "however , evidence for the latter is weak , given the low quality of the fits ( generally large @xmath8 ) , central cd galaxy ( in abell 2029 ) , low central resolution ( in emss 1358 ) , and relatively high value of the concentration parameter with respect to expectations from numerical simulations ( in hydra a ) .",
    "clearly , many more _ chandra _ and xmm observations of the central regions of clusters are needed in order to discern a clear trend in the shape of dm profiles there .    over the last few years",
    "the nfw profile has been adopted in calculations of the structure and evolution of cdm halos , this in spite of its unappealing central cusp .",
    "there is a clear need for further exploration of cluster mass profiles with the aim of either modifying the nfw profile , or finding an alternative profile that is more consistent with observations .",
    "the inconsistency between observational results and predictions from simulations provides considerable motivation for a more _ phenomenological _ approach that is based on dynamical deductions from the observed properties of ic gas , an approach that is adopted in this paper .",
    "the gas density and temperature profiles can be determined from current high quality x - ray measurements ; these profiles can then be used to probe the total density distribution .",
    "we begin with a short review of ic gas density profiles , and their use to probe the dm profile based on the hydrostatic equilibrium ( he ) equation . in section 3",
    "we describe the limitations of the nfw profile for the ic dm density .",
    "alternative dm profiles are discussed in section 4 ; we consider the requirements from a dm profile , and attempt a solution to the divergence problem of the nfw profile in section 4.1 .",
    "this consists of a slight but physically important modification of the nfw profile which results in a finite density at the center .",
    "a theoretical discussion of new phenomenological dm profiles is given in section 4.2 .",
    "next ( section 5 ) , we confront several different dm profiles with observational data , primarily a sample of rosat measurements of 24 nearby and moderately distant clusters at redshifts @xmath9 , and draw some conclusions on the form of the most viable profile . in section 6",
    "we summarize and briefly discuss a few other aspects of the subject matter .",
    "spectral measurements of thermal bremsstrahlung x - ray emission from ic gas provide an integrated measure of the emissivity - weighted temperature , while the gas density profile is deduced from measurements of the surface brightness ( sb ) distribution across the cluster . a starting point in a theoretical description of the gas in a relaxed cluster",
    "is the attainment of he , and although this includes aspehrical configurations , the assumption of spherical symmetry is still reasonable for at least a subset of rich and regular clusters .",
    "the expected availability of uniform datasets of measurements of many clusters with the xmm and _ chandra _ satellites motivates a more realistic modeling of the gas thermal and spatial distributions than afforded by an isothermal @xmath10 model .",
    "an example for a more general description is a polytropic equation of state @xmath11 relating the ( thermal , assumed dominant ) pressure and ( _ gas _ ) density , with the index @xmath12 as a free parameter .",
    "the he equation is then @xmath13 where k , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the boltzmann constant , the mean molecular weight , and the proton mass , respectively ; @xmath16 is the total cluster mass interior to @xmath5  a sum of the masses of dm , gas and galaxies .",

    "x - ray sb profile that corresponds to this density is of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the central sb , @xmath23 denotes the projected distance from the cluster center , and @xmath10 is a fit parameter .",
    "the x - ray deduced gas parameters are used in the he equation to determine @xmath16 . in the simplest treatment the gas contribution to the gravitational field can be ignored , to first approximation , since the gas mass fraction is @xmath24 .",
    "the nfw dm profile is @xmath25 where @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is a scaling radial parameter .",
    "both @xmath27 and the central density @xmath28 are related to the cosmological parameters ( nfw 1997 ) .",
    "while it is generally deduced from n - body simulations that the dm density is asymptotically @xmath29 , the behavior of the nfw profile in the inner core is problematic : there is no clear observational evidence for such density cusps in clusters . specifically , the deduced mass distribution in clusters disagrees with that deduced from the nfw profile , and the x - ray sb calculated from this profile has a much smaller core radius than deduced from observations ( suto et al .",
    "of course , the rise of density can be truncated below a certain inner radius and replaced by a constant value ; this , however , is too arbitrary .",
    "the discrepancy is even larger in cd clusters .     and @xmath12 .",

    "there is a noticeable difference between these profiles and the nfw profile , especially at @xmath35 .",
    "the calculated profiles converge to a constant central density , while the nfw profile diverges in this region . in the outer region",
    "the falloff of the nfw profile is more moderate than those of the other profiles .",

    "the two profiles are similar , with differences smaller than 10% .",
    "differences between the gas distribution deduced from the nfw profile and the @xmath10 profile can also be demonstrated by their related x - ray sb .",
    "fitting this predicted sb profile to the observed profile , which is known to have a @xmath10 model shape , results in the dependence displayed in figure 3 .",
    "surface brightness profile and a general @xmath10 profile , respectively.,width=302 ]    clearly , the sb predicted from the nfw profile does not provide a reasonably good fit to the @xmath10-model sb function .",

    "these results are consistent with those of suto et al .",
    "thus , it is clear that the general sb function @xmath43 gives a better fit to @xmath44 than does @xmath45 .",
    "we conclude that the nfw profile seems to be inconsistent with x - ray observations of clusters .",
    "the main physical reason for the above differences is the excessively high dm concentration that is predicted by the nfw model in the central cluster region .",
    "when the nfw profile is substituted in the more general polytropic he equation ( 1 ) , the resulting gas density is @xmath46^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}\\,.\\ ] ] this function assumes negative values beyond a critical radius and is therefore physically unacceptable at larger radii .    for a cluster with a maximal radius @xmath47 , the requirement that the profile is non - negative constrains the value of the polytropic index to be @xmath48 where we took @xmath49 since @xmath50 is a monotonically increasing function for the nfw profile . in table 1",
    "we list the upper limit on the polytropic index for various values of @xmath47 and @xmath51 , with a typical value of the scale radius , @xmath52 .",
    "the results weakly depend on the value of the scale radius ; for larger values of @xmath53 , , @xmath54 @xmath55 , the value of @xmath56 increases only by @xmath57 .",

    "having discussed the possibly problematic features of the nfw model , we now want to find alternative dm profiles that are more physically viable and are consistent with x - ray sb measurements . to do so we first specify the properties desired of a dm profile , and then consider a slightly modified nfw profile , and  more generally ",
    "the simplest functional forms that satisfy the requirements from a dm profile .",
    "we require that a dm profile has the following properties :    @xmath58 finite , positive - definite at all @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath59 asymptotic @xmath4 behavior at large @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath60 an associated gas profile ( from he equation ) that has the form of a @xmath10-profile with a value of @xmath10 which is consistent with x - ray sb measurements .",
    "the first property is an obvious physical requirement ; the second is based on results of many n - body simulations , and the third is based on fits to observed sb profiles of many clusters . in assessing the viability of a dm profile we will also consider whether the central mass density is high enough for observable effects of gravitational lensing . in some clusters",
    "the measurements of either giant arcs , strong , or weak gravitational lensing imply that the dm central density needs to be sufficiently high to produce these lensing effects .",
    "specifically , the central surface density has to be typically higher than the critical value of @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) in order that multiple lensed images are produced ( subramanian & cowling 1986 ) .",
    "an operational approach to the divergence problem of the nfw profile is to replace it in the inner region , @xmath64 , with a non - divergent form . from figures 1 & 2 ,",
    "it is clear that in the central region of the cluster the nfw profile is much steeper than either @xmath65 or @xmath66 , intersecting these curves inside the cluster core .",
    "therefore , in order to remove the divergence of the nfw profile , in this inner region we replace the nfw profile with the functional form obtained as a solution  eq .",
    "( 5 )  to the he equation when taking a @xmath10-profile for the gas .",
    "this form can then be tailored to the nfw profile outside the inner region , namely @xmath67^{-3            \\beta/2}\\right\\}^{\\gamma-1}\\left\\{\\left[-3      \\beta\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)+1\\right ] ( r / r_c)^2 + 3\\right\\}}{\\left [       1+(r / r_c)^2 \\right ] ^2 }   & \\mbox{$ r\\leq r_{b}$ } \\\\ \\\\",

    "the new modified profile is not smooth at @xmath68 , but it is continuous at this point , and at larger radii it falls off asymptotically as @xmath4 . if we were to fit it by the functions of the kind of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the fit would be excellent in the central region , but the quality of the fit would deteriorate outside this region .",
    "thus , the overall discrepancy between this modified dm profile and the profile deduced from the measured gas density would still remain .",
    "( note that the dm profile can be similarly changed in clusters with a giant cd galaxy whose dm density distribution is generally different from the nfw profile . )      adopting a purely phenomenological approach we can readily write down a family of dm profiles that satisfy the first two requisite properties , resembling an isothermal profile in the inner region and falloff asymptotically as @xmath4 at large radii .",
    "these profiles can be characterized by a scale radius @xmath69 ( which is generally different from the nfw scale radius @xmath53 ) , and the set of three parameters @xmath70,@xmath71 : @xmath72\\left[1+x^\\nu\\right]^\\lambda}\\,,\\ ] ] for which @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",

    "in an attempt to further distinguish between the four dm profiles described in the previous section and possibly select the most realistic profile based on available observational data , we have used results from a sample of sb profiles of clusters measured with the rosat pspc .",
    "the sample  a subset of a dataset which was compiled and investigated by ettori & fabian ( 1999 ; the data were kindly provided by ettori )  consists of 24 clusters with x - ray luminosities @xmath119 erg @xmath120 ( taking @xmath121 ) , at redshifts in the range @xmath122 .",
    "we have selected nearby and moderately distant clusters for which the rosat pspc provides some  albeit not optimal  spatial resolution ( for more details , see ettori & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "we performed fits of the measured sb profiles to those predicted from three different models for the isothermal gas density .",
    "the assumption of gas isothermality is a reasonable approximation to the temperature profile at radii larger than @xmath123 .",
    "all three models were deduced from the he equation adopting these dm profiles : nfw , and our first ( @xmath85 ) and second ( @xmath124 ) models .",
    "the corresponding gas density distributions are @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128+(x-1)\\ln(1+x^2)\\right\\ } } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 .",
    "the fits were performed by @xmath129 minimization ( using the minuit cern program ) .",
    "results of the fits are summarized in table 3 , where in addition to listing the best - fit values of the scale radii and @xmath51 , values of the reduced @xmath129 ( @xmath8 ) and the standard deviation for the reduced @xmath129 are also specified .",
    "of the three models , the first dm profile provides the best fit to the data of 11 out of the 24 clusters , with the second profile providing the best fit in 8 clusters .",
    "furthermore , for most of the latter 8 clusters the differences between the quality of the fits based on the first and second dm models are not statistically significant . based on the results from this rosat dataset",
    "it is apparent that the first dm profile is most consistent with the data while the nfw profile is the least favored .",
    "( we note that all three fits to the data on three clusters  a478 , a1763 & a3667  are very poor , raising doubts on the validity of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in these clusters , perhaps due to ongoing merger activity ? ) .    in order to assess the impact of a more precise but similar database",
    ", we have repeated the fits by artificially reducing the observational errors in the measurements of the sb .",
    "doing so does not affect appreciably the quality of the fit to the sb from the first dm model , but reduces the consistency with the second dm model and significantly worsening the viability of the nfw profile .",
    "clearly , since this test is based on the current database it does not add independent confirmation of the results , but rather just a simulation of what might be feasible to do when higher quality data become available .",
    "the aim of this work has been to find alternative dm profiles that are finite at the cluster center and are consistent with observed x - ray sb profiles .",
    "our approach is purely phenomenological and is based on the selection of simple non - cusped profiles that falloff asymptotically as @xmath29 at large @xmath5 .",
    "we first constructed two modified nfw profiles ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) by truncating the nfw below some inner radius ( @xmath130 ) merely to remedy the central divergence of the nfw model . since @xmath131 kpc ,",
    "the new profiles quickly converge to the nfw profile .",
    "but the requirement that the related gas density profile has an associated thermal bremsstrahlung sb with the typical @xmath10 model shape led us to abandon these modified profiles as realistic alternatives to the nfw model .",
    "we then considered four new profiles characterized by the three parameters ( @xmath132 ) with the requisite features , and tested their viability by contrasting their associated sb profiles with rosat data on a sample of 24 clusters .",
    "comparison of the gas profiles resulting from the new dm models with @xmath10 gas profiles clearly shows that all of these give better results than the nfw profile . below a radius of about 1 mpc ,",
    "the behavior of all four profiles is acceptable , but progressively degrades at larger radii . examining the sb profile calculated from the different dm profiles we saw that the results are not unequivocal , namely that the general shape of the sb function can be fitted quite well to a @xmath10 sb profile .",
    "this is so for a fit done over a large range of radii ; the fit is particularly good over the radial range @xmath133 .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that a sb that has the shape of a @xmath10 profile necessarily has a flat slope in the central region . upon detailed comparison of the results of the fits , as well as consistency with polytropic gas distributions",
    ", we concluded that the first of these four profiles , for which @xmath134 : @xmath135 is most consistent with the rosat sample .",
    "we emphasize , however , that due to the large observational uncertainties the preference of the first profile over the second is not large .",
    "it is quite likely that the availability of more precise x - ray sb and temperature measurements will enable a more definite distinction to be made between these viable alternatives to the nfw profile .",
    "independent recent work ( el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 ) also leads to a resolution of the core catastrophe in galaxies  the discrepancy between the diverging inner density profile of dm from cdm n - body simulations and the finite core deduced from observations .",
    "these authors suggest the gas in galaxies is not initially smoothly distributed in the dm halo , but rather is concentrated in small clumps containing @xmath136 of the total mass .",
    "the orbital energy of the clumps dissipates by dynamical friction as they move in background of dm particles , thereby transferring energy to the dm and heating it .",
    "this process is said to be sufficiently effective to turn the primordial cusp of the dm profile into a non - diverging core , resulting in a profile of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a fixed parameter , @xmath139 and @xmath19 are a scale parameter and core radius , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it was found that best fits require that @xmath140 , which then yields essentially the same profile that we have deduced for clusters .",
    "this similarity between the behavior of the dm profile in galaxies and in clusters is indeed expected in theories of formation and evolution of the large scale structure .",
    "gravitational drag could also be important in clusters ( e.g. , rephaeli & salpeter 1980 ) , so a similar process of transfer of kinetic energy of the galaxies ( initially with their dm halos ) to the ic dm could have flattened also cluster profiles .",
    "flattening of dm profiles in the centers of galaxies and clusters is suggested by other theoretical considerations .",
    "for example , donghia , firmani & chincarini ( 2002 ) have recently argued that the flattening can occur in galactic and cluster centers if the dm in these systems consists of weakly self - interacting particles .",
    "collisions between the particles during system collapse and the associated inward transfer of heat lead to expansion of the core .",
    "they propose that this process is implemented in n - body simulations by modifying the initial conditions and taking a self - interaction cross section that is inversely proportional to the particle velocity .",
    "finally , the physical motivation to find a more acceptable form for dm density profiles in galaxies and clusters , and the already available observational data , provide a viable basis for selecting between simple , well - behaved profiles .",
    "we have identified what seems to be the most consistent form of the dm distribution in clusters .",
    "our work has been based on a simplified theoretical description of clusters  such as the sphericity of the cluster and isothermality of ic gas  assumptions that can be relaxed when higher quality spectral and spatial xmm and _ chandra _ measurements of clusters will be available .",
