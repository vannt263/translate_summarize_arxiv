    "the prominence of string theory as a theory of everything , in particular a quantum theory of gravity , means that we should examine its consequences in regimes where it departs from the einstein gravity .",
    "one way of examining the consequence of string theory on the solutions of classical gravity is through the use of the field equations which arise from the effective action of a low - energy limit of string theory .",
    "this effective action which describes gravity at the classical level consists of the einstein - hilbert action plus curvature - squared terms and higher powers as well , and in general give rise to fourth order field equations and bring in ghosts @xcite .",
    "however , if the effective action contains the higher powers of curvature in particular combinations , then only second order field equations are produced and consequently no ghosts arise @xcite .",
    "the effective action obtained by this argument is precisely of the form proposed by lovelock @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to suppose that the construction of the taub - nut solutions of gauss - bonnet gravity , which is the first order corrections of the string theory at low energy , might provide us with a window on some interesting new corners of this theory .",

    "the most natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensional spacetimes with the assumption of einstein  that the left hand side of the field equations is the most general symmetric conserved tensor containing no more than second derivatives of the metric  is lovelock theory . the gravitational action of this theory can be written as @xcite @xmath15}\\alpha _ { k}{\\cal l}_{k } \\label{lov1}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath17 , @xmath18 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath19 is the euler density of a @xmath2-dimensional manifold , @xmath20 in eq .",

    "the first term is the cosmological term , the second term is just the einstein term , and the third term is the second order lovelock ( gauss - bonnet ) term . from a geometric point of view",
    "the combination of these terms in five and six dimensions is the most general lagrangian that yields second order field equations , as in the four - dimensional case for which the einstein - hilbert action is the most general lagrangian producing second order field equations .",
