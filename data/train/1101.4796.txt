    "we find clear evidence for a lensing - induced cross - correlation between sub - mm sources at high redshifts and galaxies at low redshifts .",

    ", the clustering - induced cross - correlation @xmath102 could contaminate the lensing - induced cross - correlation @xmath103 if a higher than expected fraction of sub - mm sources reside in the low - redshift universe .",
    "as the amplitude of @xmath103 is mainly sensitive to the mean redshift of the background population rather than the exact shape of the @xmath63 ( mnard & bartelmann 2002 ) , we have carried out a simple calculation of the expected @xmath103 and @xmath102 amplitude by varying the mean redshift @xmath127 ( from 0.3 to 4.0 ) and the width @xmath128 ( from 0.2 to 2.5 ) , assuming the @xmath63 of the sub - mm sources can be approximated by a gaussian function . in all cases , to reproduce the measured cross - correlation signal , @xmath102 is at most comparable to @xmath103 when @xmath129 , @xmath130 or @xmath131 .",
