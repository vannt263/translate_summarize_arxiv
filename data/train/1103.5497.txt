    "the problem of formation and evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the center of gigant elliptic and disk galaxies remains unsolved . the black hole growth is usually related to its coexistence with the surrounding matter , both baryonic and dark matter .",
    "some models consider these black holes are the result of the evolution of seed black holes of various initial masses that grow through accretion , for instance , if there are seed black holes as the result of primordial gas clouds collapse at the early evolution of galaxies , the seeds would have masses of the order of @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xcite , whereas when the seeds are considered to be the result of the collapse of relativistic massive stars the seeds should have started with masses of the order of hundreds of solar masses @xcite ; also combined models of the collapse of primordial gas and dark matter are assumed as black hole seeds of intermediate masses @xcite .",
    "the study of bolometric quasar luminosity function at various distances indicates that the accreted mass of supermassive black holes should be baryonic @xcite , however no final answer about the amount of accreted dark matter by smbhs is available , for instance in @xcite it is shown that dark matter contributes with at most @xmath5 of the total accreted mass , which together with observations of the bolometric quasar luminosity confirms that baryons are the main matter component that feeds the black hole through accretion .",
    "standard analyses of smbhs growth are based on the study of the evolution of phase space distributions , for instance , if smbhs are primarily fed by collisionless dark matter , or stars , the key problem to overcome is how to refill the loss cone @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that the timescale for this is too long for collisionless matter to contribute significantly to black hole growth @xcite , though box orbits in a triaxial potential might provide an interesting caveat to this argument @xcite .",
    "another possibility is runway growth at the center of dense star clusters .",
    "this could produce intermediate mass black holes , which would be seed black holes that grow through later gas accretion @xcite , which is expected to be fueled by mergers @xcite .",
    "concerning the non - radial accretion process , particles have to overcome the angular momentum barrier in order to get the gas to the very center of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "mechanisms proposed include the `` bars within bars '' model @xcite and direct collapse of cold clouds @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , non standard models consider the smbhs grow through the direct accretion of self - interacting or collisional dark matter @xcite . in this case , the self interaction cross section is tuned to ensure that the loss cone is refilled by diffusion on an interestingly short timescale .",
    "collisional dark matter has also been studied at galactic scale as a possible solution to the galactic core problem @xcite and the corresponding gravitational collapse @xcite . the collisional dark matter also finds its candidates from extensions to the standard model of particles , for example singlets @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a totally different approach that considers both the collisional and the collisionless dark matter .",
    "it consists in the solution of the fully relativistic time - dependent euler equations for a fluid on a schwarzschild black hole space - time , where the fluid plays the role of dark matter .",
    "we model the collisional and collisionless dark matter as a relativistic ideal gas with and without pressure respectively , in order to study the possibility that the pressure itself suffices to stop the accretion and pull the system toward a stationary state that allows the smbh to have the observed masses .",
    "we measure the accretion rate of dark matter into the black hole parametrized by the equation of state , initial dark matter density and initial infall velocity .    given that we only consider radial accretion , our results for both the collisional and collisionless cases are upper bounds to more general accretion situations where non - trivial impact parameters of the dark fluid particles are considered , for instance those where rotation of dark matter particles is considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : euler ] we define the relativistic euler equations describing the fluid on a schwarzschild black hole , whereas in section [ sec : numerics ] we explain the numerical methods we use ; in section [ sec : results ] we show our results for the extrapolation to the supermassive black hole plus dark matter system and in [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in order to track the evolution of a perfect fluid on a non - flat space - time it is necessary to write down the general relativistic euler equations . for a generic fixed space - time",
    "these can be derived from the local conservation of the stress - energy tensor @xmath6 and the local conservation of the number of baryons :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the proper rest mass density , @xmath9 is the 4-velocity of the fluid and @xmath10 is the covariant derivative consistent with the 4-metric of the space - time @xcite .",
    "the stress energy tensor representing a perfect fluid in general relativity is given by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the pressure , the specific enthalpy and the 4-metric tensor of the space - time , respectively .",
    "we choose to write down the space - time metric in the 3 + 1 decomposition fashion for a coordinate system @xmath15 , that is @xcite :    @xmath16    where the latin indices @xmath17 label the three spatial coordinates of the space - time , @xmath18 is called the lapse function and together with the shift vector @xmath19 determine the foliation of the space - time in space - like hypersurfaces ; @xmath20 is the induced three metric that relates proper distances on the spatial hypersurfaces @xcite .    with this information ,",
    "the unknown quantities of euler equations are the following primitive variables : the rest mass density of the fluid @xmath8 , its pressure @xmath12 and its velocity measured by an eulerian observer @xmath21 defined in terms of the spatial part of the 4-velocity of the fluid by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the lorentz factor @xmath24 .",
    "given that there are five unknowns and four equations the system is closed with an equation of state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the specific internal energy , defined by @xmath27 .    even though one can write down relativistic euler equations straightforwardly in terms of the primitive variables , we work with conservative variables that allow one to write down the relativistic euler equations as a set of flux balance laws    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the vector of conservative variables , @xmath30 are the fluxes in the three spatial directions , @xmath31 is a source vector .",

    "we also implement an atmosphere that prevents the rest mass density to be small enough as to provoke that relativistic euler equations diverge or develop unphysical results , because when the density is extremely small the enthalpy diverges which provokes the numerical implementation to fail , which combines with round off errors through arithmetic operations , cumulate during the evolution and finally produce approximations that are not accurate .",
    "the atmosphere we use is such that @xmath44 , which is a value that allows the convergence of our numerical methods .",
    "the need of the atmosphere is in fact one of the reasons why it is not -at the moment- trivial to simulate evolutions of fluids with ultra low densities and the reason why our results on dark matter are actually extrapolations of numerical experiments with rather higher densities of matter .",

    "we choose the excision radius to be at @xmath48 , that is , half the schwarzschild radius , which is both , far enough from the singularity at @xmath49 and provides a buffer zone @xmath50 for the fluid inside the horizon to flow smoothly from the horizon toward the excised chunk of the domain .    on the other hand",

    "then we apply a self - convergence test of our variables in order to verify that our calculations carried out under a discretized domain converge to a correct solution in the continuum limit .",
    "that is , we want to make sure that our implementation is consistent , which in practice means that when increasing the numerical resolution , our numerical solution converges fast enough toward a continuous solution of the continuous equations , which is a highly non - trivial test @xcite",

    "however , due to numerical restrictions in the use of ultralow fluid densities -as corresponds to dark matter- in geometrical units when solving the relativistic euler equations ; we study the accretion of fluid densities numerically tractable and then extrapolate our results to the density corresponding to dark matter and extract our conclusions .",

    "<S> based on the numerical solution of the time - dependent relativistic euler equations onto a fixed schwarzschild background space - time , we estimate the accretion rate of radial flow toward the horizon of a test perfect fluid obeying an ideal gas equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the accretion rate in terms of the initial density of the fluid for various values of the inflow velocity in order to investigate whether or not sufficiently arbitrary initial conditions allow a steady state accretion process depending on the values of the pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate our results to the case where the fluid corresponds to dark matter and the black hole is a supermassive black hole seed . then we estimate the equation of state parameters that provide a steady state accretion process . </S>",
    "<S> we found that when the pressure of the dark matter is zero , the black hole s mass grows up to values that are orders of magnitude above @xmath0 during a lapse of 10gyr , whereas in the case of the accretion of the ideal gas dark matter with non zero pressure the accreted mass can be of the order of @xmath1 for black holes of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that if dark matter near a supermassive black hole acquires an equation of state with non trivial pressure , the contribution of accreted dark matter to the supermassive black hole growth could be small , even though only radial accretion is considered .    </S>",
