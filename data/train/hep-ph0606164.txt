    "the search for new very weakly interacting light particles was motivated by the theoretical idea of the axion , a particle arising@xcite when one introduces the peccei - quinn symmetry@xcite in order to solve the strong cp - problem . when allowing the breaking scale of the symmetry to be a very high energy scale one obtains the so called invisible axion , named this way because of its very weakly interactions .",
    "also , the theory of the axion predicts a very small mass for it . a milestone in axion physics was the realization by sikivie that it was not impossible to probe the existence of the axion with feasible experiments@xcite .",
    "in@xcite there are some proposals to look for axions .",
    "all are based on the axion - photon conversion in a magnetic field , an effect that is described by the interaction term @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath2 its dual , and @xmath3 the axion field .",
    "one may envisage to detect axions if they constitute the galactic dark matter halo ( haloscope ) .",
    "another type of experiment ( helioscope ) is based on the fact that light particles should be produced in the interior of the sun , and subsequently leave it in the form of a continuous flux . at the earth , we can try to detect this solar flux by looking at axion conversion to x - rays in a magnetic field .",
    "finally , there is the remarkable effect of light shining through a wall : in a magnetic field , light oscillates into axions , these cross a wall and afterwards they convert back into photons .    here",
    "we will be concerned with helioscopes and also with another detection method that was proposed in@xcite .",
    "it consists in letting a polarized laser to propagate in a magnetic field .",
    "the real conversion of photons to axions produces a selective absorption of one of the two laser polarization ( dichroism ) , and the virtual conversion photon - axion - photon produces a phase retardation of one of the polarizations ( birefringence ) . if we write ( [ l ] ) as @xmath4 we see that it is the polarization ( taken as the direction of the electric field in the laser ) parallel to the external magnetic field that gets affected .",
    "let us mention that any light particle coupled to two photons could be able to give a positive signal in these experiments .",
    "this general situation has been studied in@xcite . in the case",
    "that the particle is a pseudoscalar , we would have a lagrangian similar to ( [ l ] ) .",
    "notice that a light scalar particle , with a lagrangian given by @xmath5 also may be detected in an helioscope , may induce light shining through walls and also may be responsible of dichroism and birefringence , although it is now the polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field that intervenes , since ( [ ls ] ) can be written as @xmath6 i will refer to these hypothetical particles , either pseudoscalar or scalar , as axion - like particles .",
    "recently , there have been two groups that have announced experimental results on axion - like particles coupled to photons .",
    "first , there is the helioscope of the cast collaboration that has not observed any signal coming from the sun and has put the limit@xcite @xmath7 valid for a mass of the light particle @xmath8 ev .",
    "the second result is by the pvlas collaboration .",
    "they have a positive signal consistent in a rotation of the plane of the polarization of a laser propagating in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "their result can be interpreted in terms of an axion - like particle .",
    "it is consistent with a scale @xmath9 and with a light particle mass @xmath10 ev .",
    "we notice that the two results are in strong contradiction .",
    "in fact the pvlas result is also in contradiction with the stellar energy loss bounds .",
    "these bounds are obtained when noticing that light @xmath3 particles would be produced by the primakoff - like effect due to the interaction ( [ l ] ) or ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "if the produced @xmath3 s escape freely from the star the whole process constitutes a non - standard channel of energy - loss , which is limited by observational data on stellar evolution time scales .",
    "these arguments lead to the bound@xcite @xmath11    if all these results are confirmed of course we will need to find a model where we can understand ( [ pvlas ] ) , ( [ cast ] ) , and ( [ stellar ] ) at the same time .",
    "let us start discussing two possible ways to evade ( [ stellar ] ) as discussed in@xcite .",
    "first , we may assume that @xmath3 s are indeed produced in the sun core , but they get trapped because of some additional interactions and diffuse with extremely small mean free path up to the solar surface .",
    "this could in principle evade the astrophysical bounds .",
    "unfortunately a satisfactory model has yet to be found@xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that there is much less production in the sun than expected .",
    "we shall here report recent work we have done@xcite along this second line . for related approaches see@xcite .",
    "we shall assume that the neutral @xmath3 particle couples to two photons through a triangle with a new fermion @xmath12 ; see fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "we wish that this new particle @xmath12 has small electric charge on the one hand , and on the other hand we want this charge to decrease when going from the momentum transfer involved in the pvlas experiment , @xmath13 0 , to the typical momentum transfer in the solar processes , @xmath14 kev@xmath15 . in order for this second condition to happen",
    "it is already clear that we need to advocate for new physics with a very low energy scale .",
    "we can meet both conditions in the context of paraphoton models@xcite . to start with ,",
    "these models are the only ones , as far as we know , where the effective electric charge of some particles can be naturally very small .",
    "the idea is that particles with paracharge get an induced electric charge proportional to some small mixing angle @xmath16 between photons and paraphotons . to satisfy the second condition , i.e. , to get a variation of the effective electric charge with energy",
    ", we use a model with two light but massive paraphotons with the same mixing with the photon .",
    "if the fermion @xmath12 couples to the two paraphotons with opposite paracharge , the resulting effective electric charge for @xmath12 decreases with energy or temperature @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass scale of the paraphoton masses ( in ( [ decrease ] ) we assume @xmath20 ) . with @xmath21 ev and @xmath16",
    "such that @xmath22 , our model is able to accommodate the strength of the pvlas signal and yet have a very suppressed emission in the sun . notice that in our model the cast limit ( [ cast ] ) , which is based on a standard solar @xmath3-flux , does not hold .    summarizing , we have presented a paraphoton model that evades the astrophysical bounds on axion - like particles and is consistent with the cast and the pvlas experimental results .",
    "we would like to congratulate mario greco as well as giorgio bellettini and giorgio chiarelli for the superb organization of the xxth session of the workshop .",
