    "the validity of the no - slip boundary condition is at the center of our current understanding of fluid mechanics .",
    "it remains however an assumption whose microscopic validity has been widely debated @xcite .",
    "the widespread acceptance of the no - slip condition is based on a historical record of outstanding agreement between theories and experiments .",
    "it is commonly agreed that the no - slip condition results from inevitable microscopic roughness , which causes enough viscous dissipation to effectively bring the fluid to rest near the surface @xcite . remarkably , this explanation is independent of the nature of the solid and the liquid , contrary to ideas first proposed by girard ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the development of small devices has recently prompted a reexamination of fluid slip on length scales of nanometers and microns , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the degree of slip is usually quantified by a slip length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the slip velocity and @xmath2 is the liquid strain rate evaluated at the surface ; equivalently , @xmath3 is the distance below the solid surface where the velocity extrapolates linearly to zero @xcite . in experiments",
    ", slip is usually found when the liquid partially wets the solid surface ; measured slip lengths span four orders of magnitude , from molecular sizes to microns , and are usually shear - dependent in squeeze flow experiments , with @xmath3 an increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , zhu & granick @xcite reported squeeze flow experiments , in which two crossed cylinders oscillate about a fixed average distance . by measuring the viscous resistance ,",
    "zhu & granick extracted the slip length over a wide range of oscillation amplitudes .",
    "these experiments lead to the largest shear - dependent slip lengths yet ( up to @xmath4 2 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the origin of this large shear dependent slip is heretofore mysterious .",
    "nanobubbles have recently been observed on hydrophobic surfaces , using atomic force microscopy , with typical thickness @xmath6 nm , typical radius @xmath7 nm and high surface coverage @xcite .",
    "although the origin of these bubbles is unclear and skepticism remains in the community about their existence , they have been often invoked as a possible origin of the so - called hydrophobic attraction @xcite and their existence points to a possible picture for such large slip @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there is in general a non - zero velocity at a liquid - gas interface , and therefore it is natural to wonder whether the existence of such a gas layer at the solid surface is sufficient to explain the experiments .",
    "when a fluid of viscosity @xmath8 adjoins a layer of fluid of thickness @xmath9 with smaller viscosity @xmath10 , the discontinuous strain rate at the fluid - fluid interface results in an apparent slip with slip length @xmath11 choosing @xmath12 appropriate for a gas - water interface leads to slip lengths as large as @xmath13 nm .",
    "this estimate is however independent of the interfacial shear and therefore unable to explain the squeeze flow experiments ; it also overestimates the slip length in the case of bubbles , as is discussed in section [ comparison ] .",
    "note however that similar arguments are consistent with data from pressure - driven flow experiments where reported slip lengths to date are essentially shear - independent @xcite .    in this article , we will assume bubbles exist on hydrophobic surfaces and will calculate their _ dynamic _ response to an imposed oscillatory shear . in an oscillatory squeeze flow experiment @xcite , we argue that the pressure fluctuations in the fluid cause the bubbles to act as a `` leaking mattress '' , with both compression and dilation of the gas in the bubble , as well as diffusion of gas into ( and out of ) the bubble . as the solid sphere oscillates , this periodic in - phase response of the bubbles sizes reduces the amount of liquid necessary to be squeezed out of the gap and thereby the force on the moving sphere , creating an apparent slip .",
    "our calculations indicate that the magnitude of this apparent slip is consistent with the observations of zhu & granick .",
    "we present the details of our model in the next section and discuss the comparison with the experiment in section [ comparison ] .",
    "a typical oscillatory squeeze flow experiment is shown in figure  [ figure ] . a sphere of radius @xmath14 oscillates with velocity @xmath15 in a viscous liquid of viscosity @xmath16 at a distance @xmath17 of a planar surface ( equivalently",
    ", the surfaces can be two crossed cylinders ) .",
    "the two surfaces are assumed to have the same physico - chemical properties .",
    "if no bubbles are present and the no slip boundary condition is satisfied on both surfaces , the lubrication force opposing the motion of the sphere is given by the reynolds equation @xmath18 if however flow occurs on the surfaces with a slip length @xmath3 , the viscous force is decreased by an amount @xmath19 @xcite given by @xmath20\\cdot\\ ] ] equation is used experimentally to infer effective slip lengths : the experimental viscous force @xmath21 is compared to the theoretical no - slip result @xmath22 and any difference is interpreted as fluid slip , with a slip length @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "let us now _ assume _ that the solid surface is covered with a percentage @xmath24 of identical gas bubbles ( figure [ figure ] ) , and determine how the bubbles modify the dynamic response .",
    "although this assumption has been made by previous authors @xcite , the physical mechanism responsible for such bubbles is unknown .",
    "simple estimates indicate that small bubbles are short lived in solution @xcite .",
    "however , stable bubbles could arise from any number of possibilities that are known to prolong bubble lifetimes , including surfactants , surface heterogeneities , or local supersaturation of dissolved gas @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in understanding whether the dynamic response of hypothesized bubbles is sufficient to rationalize slip experiments .      the total force @xmath25 resisting the oscillatory motion of the area @xmath26 of the sphere has two components : ( 1 ) a viscous lubrication force @xmath27 , due to hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations and acting on an area @xmath28 and ( 2 ) an elastic bubble force @xmath29 , due to pressure fluctuations inside the bubbles and acting on an area @xmath30 .",
    "the total force is therefore given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) denote the ( equilibrium ) pressures in the liquid and the bubbles respectively .",
    "moreover , since @xmath37 , the surface @xmath26 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "let us first calculate the hydrodynamic force @xmath27 .",
    "the presence of bubbles modifies equation in two ways .",
    "first , flow occurs over a distribution of bubbles located on an otherwise no - slip surface , so the viscous force is reduced by an amount @xmath19 given by equation , where @xmath3 is the appropriate effective slip length for flow over a distribution of bubbles @xcite .",
    "second , the size of the bubbles changes in time in response to pressure fluctuations in the liquid .",
    "this volume effect will modify the amount of liquid necessary to be squeezed out of the gap at each cycle of the oscillations , hence the viscous force .",
    "consequently , bubble dynamics has to be subtracted from the forcing @xmath15 and the hydrodynamic lubrication @xmath27 force is now given by a modified reynolds equation @xmath39 where @xmath9 is an average bubble thickness on each surface and the factor 2 accounts for the fact that each surface is covered with bubbles .",
    "is oscillated in a liquid at a distance @xmath37 of a smooth solid surface with amplitude @xmath40 and frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the surfaces are covered by microscopic gas bubbles of contact angle @xmath42 and radius of curvature @xmath43 .",
    "the set of bubbles is approximated by a gas layer of time evolving thickness @xmath44 . ]      in order to calculate @xmath45 in equation , let us now consider the dynamics of the bubbles .",
    "we assume the bubbles are undeformed by viscous stresses and remain spherical , with radius of curvature @xmath46 and interior angle ( @xmath47 ) ( see figure  [ figure ] ) .",
    "we neglect interactions between bubbles .",
    "we expect @xmath44 to depend explicitly on the forcing on the bubbles , _ i.e. _ @xmath29 .    at the small frequencies typical of squeeze flow experiments ( 1 - 100 hz ) ,",
    "the gas is isothermal , so the pressure in the bubble changes via the ideal gas law @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the volume and the mass of a single bubble .",
    "the average thickness of the gas layer is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number density of bubbles on the solid surface , so that equation can be rewritten as @xmath53 combining the time - derivative of with @xmath54 and linearizing around @xmath55 , we obtain the equation for the rate of change of the mean bubble height @xmath9 @xmath56 we thus have that the rate of change of @xmath9 is the sum of a rate of change governed by gas diffusion plus a second contribution due to the gas compressibility .",
    "we now consider the rate of gas diffusion from the bubble . in our model for the oscillatory squeeze flow experiments @xcite , bubbles lose mass by both vertical diffusion across the liquid layer and radial diffusion along the apparatus ; because of the scale separation @xmath37 , these two processes require separate treatment .    let us first consider the case of vertical diffusion . since for most common gases ,",
    "@xmath57  m@xmath58/s , the vertical peclet number @xmath59 is much smaller than unity : on the experimental time scale @xmath60 , the bubbles are approximately in instantaneous vertical diffusive equilibrium .",
    "the dissolved gas concentration above the bubble is therefore uniform throughout the liquid gap and is given , in the case of small amplitude oscillations , by henry s law @xmath61 .",
    "the mass @xmath62 of gas necessary to fill the liquid gap at this concentration is equal to the gap thickness @xmath63 times the change in concentration @xmath64 times the area in the liquid which is influenced by the bubble , _ i.e. _ @xmath65 .",
    "linearizing around @xmath66 and combining with @xmath67 , we get that @xmath62 is proportional to the bubble force @xmath29 @xmath68 consequently , the total rate of change of @xmath50 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the rate of change in the bubble mass governed by gas diffusion in the ( slowly varying ) radial direction of the apparatus ; let us now evaluate this contribution .",
    "in contrast to the vertical case , the radial oscillatory peclet number , @xmath71 , is of order unity or larger , so that radial diffusion has to be accounted for explicitly . assuming the dissolved gas is in vertical diffusive equilibrium , the time rate of change of the mass of a gas bubble @xmath72 is given by a flux integral on the bubble surface @xmath73 @xmath74 where the assumption od spherical cap bubble implies that @xmath75 .",
    "in general , the radial concentration of dissolved gas @xmath76 verifies an advection - diffusion equation with shear dependent diffusivity @xcite .",
    "however , for the small amplitude oscillation in @xcite , both advection and taylor dispersion are negligible , and @xmath76 satisfies a pure diffusion equation .",
    "we finally approximate radial concentration gradient by a simple linear law @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the typical ( shear dependent ) radial gradient length scale .",
    "equation  ( [ masschange ] ) together with henry s law leads therefore to a linear relation between the rate of change @xmath79 and the bubble force @xmath80    combining @xmath81 with  ( [ changeh ] ) ,  ( [ vertical ] ) and  ( [ c1 ] ) , we finally obtain that the mean bubble height @xmath9 satisfies the differential equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 are given by @xmath84      we finally need to calculate the bubble force @xmath29 in order to close the system of equations and .",
    "this in general requires understanding the ( equilibrium or nonequilibrium ) mechanism responsible for the presence of these long - lived bubbles .",
    "however , we can bypass this unknown physics by assuming without loss of generality that the pressure fluctuations in the bubbles and that in the liquid are proportional @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an unknown constant . hence ,",
    "bubble and hydrodynamic forces are proportional @xmath87 , and the total force on the sphere can be expressed as @xmath88      we can now combine , and to express the total force opposing the motion of the sphere @xmath89 .",
    "we obtain @xmath90 where@xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath89 and @xmath29 are related by equation , can be transformed into an ordinary differential equation for @xmath89 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "for an oscillating sphere velocity @xmath94 , the periodic solution to is given by with @xmath95 ms or less in experiments such as @xcite .",
    "] @xmath96      by comparing our model to the results of squeeze flow experiments , we find that the only choice consistent with available data at large separation distances is @xmath97 .    to see this , consider equation in the limit of large separations between the sphere and the planar surface @xmath17 .",
    "since equation shows that @xmath98 when @xmath17 is large , we get @xmath99 . moreover , @xmath100 so that , from and , we obtain @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , in the limit of large separations , we obtain that the ratio of the measured force , out - of - phase with the sphere displacement , to the expected no - slip force is given by @xmath103 within experimental errors , this ratio is always measured to be unity @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the expected lubrication no - slip force is recovered for large separation distances .",
    "we therefore need @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion is reached because we _ assume _ that the model presented in [ calculation ] is the major physical mechanism responsible for the force decrease observed in experiments such as @xcite .",
    "we obtain from that the ratio @xmath106 of the peak force out - of - phase with the sphere displacement to that expected with no - slip and no bubbles is given by @xmath107 the `` leaking mattress '' model therefore leads to an apparent slip effect , of dynamic origin .",
    "the effect is shear - dependent through the frequency dependence in : higher frequency and therefore higher shear shear rates lead to a larger apparent slip , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the model was derived under the assumption of small amplitude oscillations @xmath108 , which consequently does not appear in the final formula for @xmath106 .",
    "note that in the limit of high frequencies the force ratio becomes @xmath109 , whereas at low frequencies @xmath110 in the low frequency limit @xmath106 is independent of frequency and depends only on separation distance .",
    "furthermore , equation implies that the apparent slip effect increases with the fluid viscosity , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "it also increases with the size of the sphere @xmath14 , which might account for the large slip lengths reported in @xcite ( cm - size spheres ) as opposed to other squeeze flow experiments ( usually @xmath5m - size spheres ) .",
    "the model predicts that the measured overall apparent slip length is therefore not only a solid / liquid property but depends on the system size @xcite .",
    "we finally note from that the total pressure force on the sphere @xmath25 also contains a non - zero component in - phase with the displacement of the sphere , and therefore out - of - phase with its velocity .",
    "if we denote by @xmath111 the ratio of this in - phase response to the expected no - slip no - bubbles out - of - phase response , we obtain @xmath112 equation is a prediction of the effective elasticity provided by the bubbles to the surface , which would occur in addition to other in - phase contribution such as intermolecular forces , and is experimentally testable .",
    "the values of the in - phase responses of the forces were unfortunately not reported by zhu & granick @xcite .",
    "we present in this section a quantitative comparison of our model with the experimental results of zhu & granick in the case of deionized water , namely the four sets of data presented in figure 2 of ref @xcite .",

    "we also note that our previous study of slip in pressure - driven flow experiments lead to a similar conclusion : in order for surface - attached bubbles to be responsible for the measured effective slip , surface coverage of almost 100% was necessary @xcite .",
    "we have explored in this paper the consequences of the presence of nanobubbles on the surfaces where squeeze flow experiments are performed .",
    "we have shown that , within the framework of a simple stabilizing model , the time - dynamics of bubbles always leads naturally to a shear - dependent decrease in the measured viscous force by a `` leaking mattress '' effect .",
    "the effect was found to increase with viscosity of the fluid and the size of the sphere , in agreement with earlier experimental results .",
    "we emphasize that this mechanism is of _ dynamic _ origin , and is not a consequence of the microscopic slip at the bubble surfaces ; in particular , we argue that this is why shear - dependent slip length have not been reported by investigations of slip in pressure - driven flow experiments to date , where no oscillatory pressure is present to trigger an effect similar to the one proposed here .",
    "also , the mechanism we propose should also apply to squeeze flow experiments performed on super - hydrophobic surfaces such those reported in @xcite with small air bubbles trapped on fractal surfaces ( see also @xcite ) .    assuming the presence of bubbles , the calculations on the model",
    "have been performed with several simplifying assumptions and , in particular , additional contributions to the sets of coefficients @xmath83 could come from bridging bubbles , large amplitude oscillations of the solid sphere or bubble interactions , deformation or displacement on the solid surface .",
    "we have then presented a comparison between the results of our model when applied to the experiments of zhu & granick .",
    "we found that our model gives results which are in agreement with the force decrease measured experimentally , for bubble features which are consistent with available experimental data on nanobubbles ( bubble size @xmath153 nm , large microscopic contact angles , large surface coverage ) .",
    "finally , a formula has been proposed for the ( additional ) effective elasticity provided by the bubbles to the solid surface .",
    "we note that our study does not rule out the possibility of bubbles with dynamically selected sizes .",
    "it has been reported experimentally in @xcite that the jump - in distance between two hydrophobic surfaces in water , believed to be due to the presence of bubbles , depended on the history of the sample ; performing the experiment several times lead to changes in the jump - in distances over time which was found to remain constant only after a few periods .",
    "a similar scenario could be envisioned in experiments such as @xcite .    to conclude , we present a simple prediction based on the results of our model .",
    "if a squeeze flow experiment was performed with two different surfaces , say a hydrophobic plane and a hydrophilic sphere , force ratio measurements displaying shear - dependant results should be able to test whether the ideas put forward in this paper are valid .",
    "indeed , if the force decreases was really due , not to bubbles , but to a change in the hydrodynamic boundary condition for flow past the hydrophobic surface , the maximum force decrease one could expect to obtain is @xmath154 for the case of a perfectly slipping surface ( see @xcite for the calculation ; this result can also be found by symmetry about the plane where slip occurs ) .",
    "if alternatively the measurements are due to a `` leaking mattress '' effect similar to the one we propose here , equation should also apply ( with different prefactors ) and therefore so is equation ; consequently , force ratio smaller than @xmath154 should be obtained in this case .",
    "this proposition for an experiment , together with the prediction for the in - phase response of the force , would allow our model to be tested experimentally .",
