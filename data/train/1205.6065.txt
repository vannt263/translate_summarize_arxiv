    "molecular nanostructures on solid surfaces , especially on metal surfaces , have received great attention in recent years@xcite . properly modeling the interfacial properties of molecule - metal interfaces",
    "is of great importance to build , understand , modulate , and utilize these molecular nanostructures@xcite .",
    "some building - block molecules of these molecular structures have small or without electrical dipole moments , so that the dispersion force , not included in conventional density functional theory ( dft ) , is a major part for the van der walls force between these molecules and other nanostructures , which poses a challenge to theoretical description of the interfacial properties of these molecules on solid surfaces . profiting from the development of dft , the inclusion of it was recently realized@xcite and applied in many molecule - metal interfaces@xcite .    despite the dispersion correction",
    "being applied to many interfaces , the role of it in geometry , adsorption energy , and bonding picture , however , has not been well recognized so far . the dispersion force in perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride ( ptcda)/ag(111 ) , azobenzene / ag(111 ) , thiophene / cu(110 ) and pyrazine / cu(110 ) ,",
    "was modeled using van der walls density functional ( vdw - df)@xcite and semi - empirical dispersion corrections ( dft - d)@xcite . in terms of geometry ,",
    "experimental data of ptcda / ag(111)@xcite and azobenzene / ag(111)@xcite are available for comparison with theoretical results .",
    "it was found that neither vdw - df nor dft - d can well reproduce the experiment of ptcda / ag(111)@xcite , but an ionic final state ( ifs ) approximation@xcite that considers the electron - corehole interactions can ; and only ts@xcite , a variation of dft - d , gives a reasonable ag - n distance for azobenzene / ag(111 ) .",
    "although vdw - df shows a good performance for the calculation of adsorption energies , e.g. for ptcda / ag(111)@xcite , azobenzene / ag(111)@xcite , and thiophene / cu(110)@xcite , the performance of dft - d , a much cheaper method , is still ambiguous .",
    "furthermore , theoretical results are even conflict to each other for bonding pictures .",
    "while covalent bonding picture was previous identified using standard dft ( pbe functional ) for both pyrazine / cu(110)@xcite and c@xmath0/au(111)@xcite , the vdw - df results of c@xmath0/au(111)@xcite is consistent with the pbe calculation , but that of pyrazine / cu(110)@xcite is , however , contradictive to the pbe results that the binding of pyrazine is solely due to the dispersion force .    such a complex situation calls for a systematical investigation to make an effort towards solving this issue .",
    "since a large amount of experimental data are available@xcite , in this paper , we report density functional theory calculations of thiophene on the cu(111 ) , cu(110 ) , and cu(100 ) surfaces with the consideration of the dispersion force and electron - corehole interactions , which were , sometimes , suggested paramount in molecule - metal interfaces@xcite .",
    "the geometry of thiophene adsorbed on these three cu surfaces was relaxed using standard pbe , pbe - d , rpbe - d , and the ifs approximation . given these structures , adsorption energies of the three interfaces",
    "were calculated using pbe , pbe - d , and rpbe - d , respectively , followed by a short summary of structural prediction for these interfaces .",
    "moreover , electronic structures , including local density of states ( ldos ) , differential charge density ( dcd ) , and the real space distribution of electronic states were discussed .",
    "finally , we conclude that , although the geometry issue is even more complicated , the covalent bonding is primarily responsible to the molecule - metal interaction and the dispersion correction is helpful to correct adsorption energy .",
    "these results provide useful guidelines for future applications of dispersion corrections to molecule - metal interfaces .",
    "calculations were carried out by the general gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation potential@xcite , the projector augmented wave method@xcite , and a plane wave basis set as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package@xcite .",
    "the energy cutoff for plane - wave basis was set to 400 ev for all examined configurations .",
    "five layers of cu atoms , separated by a 20-angsrom vacuum region , were employed to model the cu surfaces .",
    "supercells p(3@xmath13 ) , p(2@xmath13 ) and p(3@xmath13 ) were adopted to investigate the adsorption of thiophene on cu(100 ) , cu(110 ) and cu(111 ) surfaces , respectively .",
    "we anchored the s atom of thiophene on the cu substrates with respect to the underlying sites , e.g. , top , bridge and hollow sites , and rotated the molecule by the symmetry operations of cu surfaces . as a result , seven",
    ", six and six initial configurations were considered for cu(100 ) , cu(110 ) and cu(111 ) , respectively .",
    "molecules were put on one side of the slab with a dipole correction applied .",
    "k_-mesh of 6@xmath21 , verified by a 8@xmath3 one , was adopted to sample all 2-d surface brillouin zones for both geometry optimization and total energy calculation . in geometry optimizations ,",
    "all atoms except those for the bottom two cu layers were fully relaxed until the residual force per atom was less than 0.02 ev /  .",
    "there are few popular ways for including dispersion forces to the conventional dft in recent years , i.e. dft - d@xcite and vdw - df@xcite .",
    "the former is a semi - empirical method that the dispersion correction is parameterized for each element .",
    "the latter is , however , an _ ab - initio _ one , in which non - local correlation effects were calculated , but usually in a non - self - consistent manner due to huge computational demand .",
    "for the same reason , vdw - df was rarely employed in structural relaxations .",
    "a large portion of this work is focused on structural related properties , so that the former method , namely dft - d , is more suitable to be adopted than the latter .",
    "structures relaxed with the dispersion correction , in the form of dft - d2@xcite , were thus presented in this paper , denoted as  pbe - d \" .",
    "a different functional , namely rpbe , was also considered in combination with the dispersion correction , denoted  rpbe - d \" .",
    "in addition , interfacial geometry of molecule - metal interfaces is measured by x - rays@xcite .",
    "it creates a core - hole when x - rays excite a core electron from an atom in a thiophene .",
    "electrons nearby are prone to transfer to the lowest unoccupied state of the excited molecule , screening the core - hole . in the meantime ,",
    "the transferred electrons start to relax to lower states and eventually fill the excited core level , eliminating the core - hole .",
    "the electron transfer process was suggested much faster than the relaxation process of the transferred electrons in ptcda / ag(111 ) and cupcf@xmath4/ag(111)@xcite .",
    "therefore , if the excitation event continuously happens and the time interval of excitations is smaller than relaxation time of the transferred electrons , some transferred electrons lack full relaxation , which results in an dynamic electron accumulation around the molecule , effectively leading to the molecule negatively charged .",
    "the geometry of a molecule in such an effectively charged state , previously denoted ifs@xcite , can be very different from its neutral groundstate .",
    "such a dynamic process may need time - dependent dft to accurately capture , which is highly computational demanding for these interfaces .",
    "it was however demonstrated that the ifs approximation with a proper effective charge , a much cheaper method , allows to well reproduce the experiments of ptcda / ag(111 ) and cupcf@xmath4/ag(111)@xcite .",
    "we thus considered the structural variations of thiophene adsorbed on cu surfaces with ifs effect included .",
    "pbe - ch-@xmath5 \" was used to indicate an ifs state with a total effective electron of @xmath6 transferred to the molecule , in which @xmath6 can be a fraction .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : adse ]      it indicates , from the three examples above , that the prediction of adsorption configuration and energy of small aromatic molecules on noble metal surfaces are very complicated .",
    "we intended to summarize some guidelines for such issue based on the experiment - theory comparison of thiophene adsorbed on cu(111 ) and cu(100 ) where experimental data are available .",
    "the surface electron density of cu(111 ) is rather high compared with other surfaces , due to the close - packed atomic arrangement , which reduces the corrugation of surface electron density .",
    "the less corrugated surface electron density is against the formation of covalent bonds where a directional ( corrugated ) charge density is preferred to maximize the wavefunction overlap .",
    "the adsorption energy of molecules on ( 111 ) is , therefore , a bit smaller than that of other surfaces .",
    "theoretical results of thiophene / cu revealed by pbe confirm this statement .",
    "nevertheless , it was too weak that the thiophene - cu(111 ) interaction obtained by pbe ( 0.07  ev ) , ascribed to the lack of the non - local correlation or the dispersion correction .",
    "the structure relaxed using pbe is also inconsistent with the experiment , roughly 0.7    larger for the cu - s distance .",
    "the inclusion of the dispersion correction ( dft - d ) leads to significantly improved adsorption energies of thiophene on cu surfaces , while the structural discrepancy remains unsolved .",
    "earlier literature demonstrated that the electron - corehole interaction shall be considered for theoretically reproducing the experimental structures of two organic molecules adsorbed on cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces@xcite , in which conventional dft failed@xcite and vdw - df can not improve @xcite . in the case of thiophene / cu(111 ) , it was shown , again , that the consideration of electron - corehole interaction and its induced screening charges is crucial to compare dft results with x - ray measured values .",
    "electron densities of the ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) surfaces are relatively low and much corrugated , which gives rise to easier formation of typical molecule - substrate covalent bonds .",
    "the pbe functional suggests a pronounced covalent nature of the cu - s bonding , although the adsorption energy was underestimated . in the presence of such a typical covalent bonding ,",
    "the theoretical atomic structure , e.g. the bond length , is less sensitive to the electron - corehole interactions , confirmed by the glycine / cu(100 ) case@xcite .",
    "therefore , the rpbe - d is sufficient to properly calculate the adsorption energy and might be capable to suitably predict the molecular configuration on these two surfaces .    in a summary to this subsection",
    ", the pbe functional underestimates the adsorption energy for all the three interfaces , especially the ( 111 ) surface ; while an additional dispersion correction to the rpbe functional ( rpbe - d ) solves this issue .",
    "the electron - corehole interaction and its induced screening charges shall be considered in theory - experiment comparisons on the ( 111 ) interfaces of ag and cu , which was repeatedly proved feasible@xcite .",
    "the electron - corehole interaction can be omitted on ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) surfaces where further experiments and higher level calculations shall be conducted to solve the experiment - theory discrepancy of the adsorption site .",
    "it was reported that experimentally measured electronic structures of metal - molecule interfaces are highly reproducible by standard dft calculations , e.g. the ptcda / ag(111 ) interface@xcite .",
    "the dispersion correction , as discussed in former subsections , noticeably shortens the cu - s bond length ( @xmath7 ) and changes the molecular tilting angle ( @xmath8 ) in all the four interfaces , which , most likely , gives rise to an appreciable variation of the electronic structures , e.g. shifting an electronic state upwards or downwards in energy .",
    "according to tab .",
    "[ tab : str ] , the dispersion correction makes thiophene 0.7   , the largest change among all the interfaces , closer to the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "in addition , although pbe identifies a weaker coupling between thiophene and cu(111 ) , it does indicate a typical covalent cu - s bonding for thiophene / cu(110 ) where the change of cu - s bond length made by the dispersion correction is the smallest , i.e. 0.06   .",
    "we thus inspected the role of the dispersion correction to the electronic density of states ( dos ) for thiophene adsorbed on cu(111 ) and cu(110 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:111-es ] .    \" refers to the s - cu distance , in unit of .,width=302 ]    figure [ fig:111-es ] shows that the dispersion correction does not significantly alter the appearance of the doss , especially for the occupied states .",
    "the 0.7  reduction of the bond length lifts up those states in the energy window from -2.0 ev ( versus the e@xmath9 , thereinafter ) to the e@xmath9 by at most 0.2 ev , while it pushes those higher - energy states closer to the e@xmath9 by roughly 0.6 ev .",
    "two appreciable new states were found near the e@xmath9 , from 0.2 ev to 0.5 ev , as denoted by the two red arrows in fig . [ fig:111-es](a ) . in the case of thiophene / cu(110 ) , however , much smaller changes to the bond length give rise to almost unchanged doss in the energy window from -2.0 ev to 0.5 ev .",
    "the two pronounced peaks sitting from 1.0 to 1.5 ev split up more by 0.28 ev from pbe ( black ) to pbe - d ( red ) , and a new state fades in at around 1.2 ev , as shown by the red arrow in fig . [ fig:111-es](b ) .",
    "no appreciable charge transfer from the metal surface to the molecule was found for thiophene / cu , different from ptcda and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , e.g. pentacene , on cu , ag , au surfaces@xcite , in which the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) interplays with substrate states . in those systems , a charge transfer from the substrate to the lumo occurs showing a fermi level pinning , i.e. lumo - substrate bonding state sitting just below the fermi level@xcite . in terms of thiophene / cu ,",
    "the hybridized lumo locates significantly higher than the fermi level , i.e. 2.1 ev and 1.2 ev for the pbe calculations of thiophene adsorbed on cu(111 ) and cu(110 ) , suggesting that the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) may , most likely , play a more important role in the molecule - substrate electronic hybridization for thiophene on cu surfaces , consistent with the electron donor nature of thiophene .              after the dispersion correction included",
    ", the electronic structures of these interfaces mainly keep their original features in terms of the appearance of doss .",
    "it implies that the bonding picture between thiophene and cu surfaces does not be affected by the applied dispersion correction , which was elucidated as follows .",
    "figure [ fig : dcd ] shows the differential charge densities ( dcd ) , defined as @xmath10 , of pbe and pbe - d relaxed structures on cu(111 ) and cu(110 ) , respectively .",
    "charge reductions ( cold colors ) were found near both cu and s ( c ) atoms , especially in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcd](a ) where the reduction below the s is the most clear among all the four plots .",
    "these reduced charges accumulate in a volume between the s and the cu underneath ( hot colors ) , indicating a typical cu - s covalent bonding .",
    "a similar cu - c covalent bonding was also clearly illustrated for thiophene / cu(110 ) by fig .",
    "[ fig : dcd](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "although a dispersive bonding picture was indicated on the basis of adsorption energy by a vdw - df calculation@xcite , a ",
    "covalent - like \" bonding does be found in c@xmath0/au(111 ) according electronic structures@xcite .",
    "since the molecule - substrate interaction of c@xmath0/au(111 ) is believed weaker than that of thiophene / cu , it strongly implies that a  covalent - like \" bonding shall be identified by electronic structures of the vdw - df results of thiophene / cu interfaces .",
    "in addition , according to the dcds shown in fig . [",
    "fig : dcd](b)-(d ) , the adsorption induces a dipole moment at the interface , which suggests an increased work - function of the surface upon the adsorption of thiophene .",
    "furthermore , the covalent bonding picture was also supported by plotting the real space distribution ( charge density ) , calculated using pbe , of the hybridized lumo - substrate states for both the interfaces , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] .",
    "it explicitly shows three pipelines , one for ( 111 ) and two for ( 110 ) , of charge density connecting s or / and c atoms and cu atoms underneath , which are compelling evidence of the s(c)-cu covalent bonding picture for thiophene adsorbed on cu surfaces .",
    "the plotted charge densities confirm again that the dispersion correction does not substantially change the covalent bonding picture of thiophene / cu interfaces .",
    "in summary , we have investigated thiophene adsorbed on the ( 111 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 100 ) surfaces of cu using dft and post - dft methods .",
    "it was found that standard dft ( pbe or rpbe ) fails to predict the interfacial structure for thiophene / cu(111 ) , underestimates the adsorption energy , but reveals correct bonding picture for the all interfaces .",
    "a post - dft method , rpbe - d , solves the issue of underestimated adsorption energy and a calculation with ifs approximation perfectly predicts the interfacial structure of thiophene / cu(111 ) . however , theoretical prediction of interfacial structures on the cu(110 ) and cu(100 ) surface is still an issue , which needs further experiments , e.g. neutron scattering , and theory to clarify . in terms of electronic structures ,",
    "partial doss of thiophene / cu(111 ) and thiophene / cu(110 ) suggest that the dispersion correction does not appreciably modify the occupied states , however , slightly perturbs the unoccupied states , in the present cases , shifting them downwards in energy .",
    "post - dft methods , e.g. dft - d , do not substantially change the results of bonding picture in these interfaces .",
    "it was suggested that adopting the rpbe - d method is crucial for properly calculating adsorption energy and related properties in these molecule - metal interfaces , however , for other properties , especially electronic properties , standard dft ( pbe ) shall give correct results .",
    "in addition , the ifs approximation was , again , demonstrated feasible for predicting x - ray - measure molecular geometries on noble metal ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "all these results shed considerable light on how to face with the experiment - theory discrepancies in molecule - metal interfaces .",
