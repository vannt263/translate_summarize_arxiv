    "nowadays , we are logging more and more to cloud services using internet terminal in public spaces with the threat of passwords being stolen .",
    "stealing passwords can be done either by machine key and mouse loggers or by human shoulder - surfing attacks .",
    "purloining passwords often opens the door to identity theft .",
    "the threat is even more important as concealed spy or surveillance digital cameras may be recording the login session , and later computer vision techniques may be used to recover the secret password .",
    "wired magazine had in december 2012 its cover page entitled ` kill the p@55w0rd ` to emphasize on the emergency of rethinking the password protection systems .",
    "there is a strong need not only to rethink passwords  @xcite but also to reconsider the user interface ( ui ) to input safely passwords .",
    "this is an important human computer interface ( hci ) problem that is gaining more and more attention with dedicated conferences like the symposium on usable privacy and security ( soups ) .",
    "ideally , we should not need to log in as the machine should recognize the unique `` me '' as sophisticated computer hal 9000 did in kubrick s film _ 2001 : a space odyssey _ ( 1968 ) .",
    "that is , ultimately , it is not the user who shall authenticate oneself but the machine who shall authenticate the user , securely .",
    "although artificial intelligence has made significant progress since that 1960 s movie release , we are yet far from such a robust non - invasive biometric system .",
    "brain machine interfaces for logging have also recently been considered  @xcite with the hope , one day , of ditching pass - words and replace them with `` pass - thoughts . ''",
    "( section  [ sec : concl ] shall review prior work . )",
    "thus we ask ourselves what would be a _ secure ui system _ to log in public spaces in front of other people using possibly a machine with unprotected and readable input / output interfaces ( i / o ) ?",
    "one solution is to use a one time password ( otp ) _ physical token device _ that is assumed to belong privately to the user .",
    "each time the user logs in , it asks the token for a newly on - demand generated password ( _ e.g. _ , typically by pushing a button on the physical token ) .",
    "however , this device may be inadvertently stolen or , even worse , some otps maybe generated by an attacker without stealing the device .",
    "the latter case is far more difficult to detect for the user that has assumed to always securely carry the device !",
    "notice that passwords should never be stored plainly on servers .",
    "this has dramatic consequences when servers are cracked , but unfortunately happens quite often as reported in the news .",
    "unix login program stores _ encrypted _ passwords either plainly in /etc / passwd file or in a privileged - access /etc / shadow file .",
    "it uses the user password as the key to cypher iteratively 25 times the 64-bit 0 string using the crypt ( ) des . to strengthen even more the password a @xmath0-character `` salt ''",
    "is generally added  @xcite .    our proposed system , called _ color pins _ ,",
    "is based on using an associate ui password for entering safely a secret i d password .",
    "the system only requires to have a secure login software ( _ e.g. _ , signed with a cryptographic key for avoiding trojan attacks ) and a random generator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : colorpin ] describes the ui login system and explain its fundamental principles .",
    "it is followed by section  [ sec : ext ] that presents some of its extensions .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] reviews prior work and discusses on several perspectives .",
    "we propose a simple technique to login using a public login name based on _ two associated passwords _ instead of the traditional single secret password scheme .",
    "since it is easy to record insidiously keyboard key strokes , our logging system uses a graphics keyboard and a cursor board user interface ( ui ) .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the color pin system using a @xmath1 color layout .",
    "the digits are colored with the corresponding matching cursor color.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the same secret i d and ui passwords at several login sessions weakens the security . indeed ,",
    "if no shuffling of the digit and/or cursor board is done , then recording , say , at the first position of the 1 digit the color sequence will provide the password information to observers . when shuffling ( at least one of the two boards )",
    ", we make different permutations of digits - color cursors .",
    "however , video recording several login sessions and analyzing the common matching digit - color pairs will provide information on the passwords .",
    "thus we should ideally change the ui password after at each session .",
    "this can be done by using a otp token device for generating ui password keys .",
    "the user then keeps his / her secret password and generate a ui password when logging .",
    "the advantage of the color pin system over the traditional otp token device is that even if the physical token is stolen then it does not allow to properly log in as the i d password is not compromised .",
    "the color pin system has been implemented using the processing language ( processing.org ) , version 2.0b8 .",
    "wrapping the cursor operating system on the screen edges ( for endless smooth toric motion ) is done using by using java class and mousemove function .",
    "we present several extensions of the associative pin code system .",
    "we can use legacy systems based on a single pin by decomposing it into two parts . for sake of simplicity , consider the pin size of even length @xmath2 .",
    "then the first @xmath3 digits of the pin are used for the traditional i d password and the last @xmath3 digits are used for the ui password with the mapping @xmath4 , ... , @xmath5 when considering digit - letter boards , or @xmath6 black , ... ,",
    "@xmath7 gray when considering digit - color boards .",
    "thus we can enter a password of length @xmath2 on legacy system using only @xmath3 association pairs .",
    "for example , the pin @xmath8 is entered using @xmath9 and @xmath10 cursors aligned to keys @xmath11 and @xmath0 , respectively ( or using lightgray and red color cursors ) .",
    "note that by doing so , we weaken the security as we have @xmath12 potential combinations instead of @xmath13 in a login session . in general , we can create a secure password including the ui password by juxtaposing the two parts : +",
    ". the ui pin may be shorter than the pin .",
    "for example , we can use letter a cursor to enter the full pin . when the ui pin is shorter than the i d pin ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) ,",
    "we choose the current cursor cursor using the _ modulo _ operator ( here , 1",
    "and 3 should be entered using a and 3 and 4 using b ) .      to make the system more general",
    ", we just need to define two boards of @xmath15 elements : the fixed board elements @xmath16 and the moveable cursor board elements @xmath17 .",
    "those elements are numbered with function @xmath18 universally using numbers @xmath11 , ... , @xmath15 : @xmath19 .",
    "this allows for various rendering styles .",
    "for example , we can use vacation images@xcite for the fixed board and numbers for the cursor board , etc .",
    "we can use icon sets or color box sets as two different rendering styles for the moveable cursor array as depicted in figure  [ fig : skins ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    instead of using 2d graphics boards , 1d layouts of fixed and moveable boards may be preferred for , say , personal picture browsing , and require less graphics space to display for a login session .",
    "thus this kind of ribbon user interface maybe appropriate to display at the bottom of other software when logging is required .",
    "we may also add _ visual effects _ : for example , we may have a color pin to memorize , and have the color cursor rolling overs the digits .",
    "each time the color is on the digit key , all digits are colored with their corresponding colors ( as shown in figure  [ fig : colorpin ] ) .",
    "indeed , human tend to memorize visual objects rather easily compared to juxtaposed id - ui associated pins",
    ". the moveable cursor may be textured ( like bark , grass , or street road textures ) and the digits textured with the corresponding highlighted texture cursor .      to help user",
    "memorize the ui password and generate many ui passwords , we define a _ user profile _ by asking a set of @xmath3 questions , each with @xmath15 choices like what is her favorite food , favorite place , favorite color , favorite celebrity , favorite movie , favorite music , etc .",
    "each time the user enters a key , the moveable cursor skin changes to the next mode ( e.g. , food@xmath20place@xmath20color@xmath20celebrity@xmath20movie@xmath20music , etc . ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath3-length passwords , we generate a random permutation on the question orders ( yielding @xmath21 ui passwords ) so that the user knows which moveable cursor shall be used to enter the current i d pin digit .",
    "this profiling frees users from memorizing ui passwords but may be less secure when observers know or guess his / her preferences .",
    "the moveable cursor board may be controlled using events sent from another device .",
    "for example , a tablet or a game pad with a touch screen may be used to send event relative displacement orders to the login application .",
    "the orders can be absolute coordinates ( rescaled to fit the display screen ) or relative motion orders encoding a translation .",
    "note that in practice , it is interesting to have a board display of relatively small size while providing a large ui pad for precise interaction .",
    "this makes the input more precise for users , say , on smart phones equipped with touch screens , where users can touch anywhere on the screen for controlling the moveable cursor array on the fixed board .",
    "we first present prior work related to our color pin system ( see references therein too ) : the cursorcamouflage  @xcite system displays a set of _ dummy _ cursors that makes it difficult for observers to correlate with the user hand motion .",
    "however , a careful video analysis of the recorded login session by advanced computer vision techniques may decipher the secret key by analyzing hand - mouse cursor correlations . in comparison ,",
    "our color pin system as no dummy cursor but instead use two key boards and two pins to identify oneself . in  @xcite , the authors present a shoulder - surfing resistant ui for entering password that uses _ pass - icons _ blended with other icons on a 2d layout ; the user is required to pass _ several challenges _ where each challenge asks to click inside the convex hull of the pass icons .",
    "this system ( like ours ) does not require to click on the pass icons .",
    "it is however more time consuming and requires laymen to be familiar with the convex hull definition . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors describe _ cognitive trapdoor games _ where the users has two select on which set the current pin code digit is contained .",
    "after a few selections , the system knows by `` intersecting '' the challenge subsets which digit was entered , and proceed for entering the next digit , etc .",
    "one major drawback is that it provides limited resilience when the session login is video - taped .",
    "the closest work to our color pin system may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the fakecursor system manages a fixed secret and a disposal secret : he / she enters her pin code by aligning the secret digit on the fixed disposal icons using left / right atm - like arrow buttons .",
    "we can interpret fakecursor as a discrete ui working on the 1d ring topology . in comparison ,",
    "our system is fully graphical as it uses 2d torus topology and requires much less user input .",
    "our system has also higher - level abstraction as it requires to define two boards generically that are associated using a universal numbering ( see section  [ sec : skin ] on skins ) , or uses a color ui otp token device for entering the i d password .",
    "the main drawback of the color pin system is to require memorizing additional information : namely , the ui password .",
    "another potential threat is by using gaze tracking and advanced computer vision , it might be possible to guess which part were `` intentionally '' aligned by observing the user eyes ( a kind of computational mentalism ) .",
    "this risk is minimized by showing a small board size .",
    "interestingly , note that conversely , there are login systems that have been designed based on eye gaze input  @xcite .    we have presented a login system that considers _ zero - knowledge ui _ for entering passwords . in perspective , instead of using the ( parallel ) visual perception system for entering a i d password , we could use tactons  @xcite : the shuffled digits on the digit boards shall not be visually displayed , but tactilically rendered using tactons , and the user shall press the corresponding tacton corresponding to the secret pin .",
    "this system is particularly well - suited for visually impaired people .",
