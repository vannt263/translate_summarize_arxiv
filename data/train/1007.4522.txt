    "materials with high thermoelectric efficiency are currently under intense theoretical and experimental investigation , largely due to the prospect of applications , e.g. , for the conversion of waste heat into electricity , or for refrigeration and on - chip cooling in microelectronics @xcite . apart from applications , thermoelectric materials also serve as an interesting testing ground for new theoretical approaches to thermoelectric transport in solids@xcite .",
