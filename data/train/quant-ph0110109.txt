    "within the framework of semiclassical periodic - orbit theory the quantization procedures for integrable and chaotic systems differ substantially .",
    "an integrable system may be quantized using ebk theory @xcite .",
    "the set of integrals @xmath0 extended along the @xmath1 fundamental cycles @xmath2 of the @xmath1-dimensional phase - space tori yield the ( semiclassical ) quantization conditions for every action variable @xmath3 . here",
    "the @xmath4 s are integer quantum numbers and the @xmath5 s are maslov indices .",
    "although not exact in general , the quantization condition ( [ ebk ] ) does ( implicitly ) produce individual energy levels @xmath6 that can be labelled , one by one , with the @xmath1 quantum numbers @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure differs markedly from the chaotic case where the focus is not on individual energy levels but on _ global _ characteristics of the spectrum .",
    "for instance , instead of finding individual energy levels as in ( [ ebk ] ) , periodic - orbit quantization schemes for chaotic systems , such as gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite compute the density of states @xmath8 from which individual energy levels are extracted indirectly as the singularities of @xmath9 . in a chaotic system",
    "the only available classical input are the periodic orbits of the system and the density of states ( [ density ] ) is computed according to @xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the average density of states , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are correspondingly the action , the period and the weight factor of the prime periodic orbit labeled by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the repetition index . again , the scheme ( [ rho ] ) is not usually exact .",
    "more seriously , however , in contrast to ( [ ebk ] ) it fails to produce individual energy levels in the form `` @xmath17 '' .",
    "the difference between ( [ ebk ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) can not be emphasized enough . while ( [ ebk ] ) allows us to `` pick and choose '' a particular energy eigenvalue , in the chaotic case all of the eigenvalues have to be computed according to ( [ rho ] ) , and only a subsequent non - analytic inspection and counting procedure allows us to focus on an individual energy level .",
    "there is , however , a class of quantum chaotic systems , regular quantum graphs @xcite , which are explicitly solvable analytically @xcite , i.e. exact periodic - orbit expansions of the form `` @xmath17 '' exist .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to expand considerably with respect to the work presented in @xcite and to present a thorough discussion of our methods and their validity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we extend the theory of quantum graphs @xcite to include dressed graphs , i.e. quantum graphs with arbitrary potentials on their bonds . in sect .",
    "iii we define regular quantum graphs and present explicit , convergent periodic - orbit expansions of individual eigenvalues . these expansions are not just formal identities ; the periodic - orbit expansions presented in sect .",
    "iii converge , and converge to the correct eigenvalues . in sect .",
    "iv we present a worked example of a simple quantum graph whose spectrum is computed in three different ways : ( i ) numerically exactly , ( ii ) via the explicit periodic - orbit expansions presented in sect .",
    "iii and ( iii ) via numerical integration using an exact trace formula for the density of states .",
    "the results of the three methods agree .",
    "this proves validity and convergence of our approach . in sect .",
    "v we summarize our results and conclude the paper .",
    "a quantum graph consists of a quantum particle whose motion is confined to a one - dimensional network of @xmath18 bonds @xmath19 connecting @xmath20 vertices @xmath21 .",
    "an example of a graph with six vertices and ten bonds is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the topology of a given graph is fully characterized by its connectivity matrix @xmath22 : @xmath23 every bond @xmath19 which connects the vertices @xmath21 and @xmath24 , supports a solution @xmath25 of the schrdinger equation @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the coordinate along @xmath19 measured from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the length of the bond .",
    "a constant , real , skew symmetric matrix @xmath31 , which plays the role of a magnetic field vector potential , is sometimes introduced as a tool for braking the time - reversal symmetry , which , in turn , is known to affect the statistics of the level distribution @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the schrdinger operator in ( [ sch ] ) by adding potentials @xmath32 on the graph bonds .",
    "we call this generalization `` dressing of the graph '' . while in general the potentials",
    "@xmath32 may depend on the bond coordinate @xmath33 and the energy @xmath34 in an arbitrary way , we restrict ourselves here to the _ scaling _ case @xmath35 which allows us to introduce physical parallels between quantum graphs and ray - splitting systems @xcite . a quantum graph with the potentials ( [ pot ] ) on its bonds",
    "can also be viewed as a generalized step potential , such as the one shown in fig .  2  ( a ) .",
    "these potentials were studied before in great detail in connection with anderson localization @xcite .",
    "potentials of this type can be represented by a linear graph , such as the one shown in fig .  2  ( b ) .",
    "scaled potentials such as ( [ pot ] ) cast the schrdinger equation into the form @xmath36 where the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 are defined on the corresponding bonds @xmath19 .",
    "depending on whether the energy @xmath39 of the particle is above or below the scaled potential height @xmath40 , the solution of equation ( [ schred ] ) on the bond @xmath19 is either a combination of the free waves , @xmath41 or a combination of the tunneling solutions , @xmath42 where the factors @xmath43 in the propagating waves ( [ psi ] ) were introduced to insure proper flux normalization @xcite . due to the scaling assumption",
    ", there is no transition between these two cases as a function of @xmath34 . from now on we shall assume that the energy @xmath34 is kept above the maximal scaled potential height , @xmath44 which will allow us to exclude the tunneling solutions ( [ tunnel ] ) . at every vertex @xmath21 ,",
    "the bond wave functions satisfy the continuity conditions @xmath45 and the current conservation conditions @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the value of the wave function at the vertex @xmath21 , and the @xmath48 s are free parameters of the problem for which the scaling is introduced as @xmath49 the conditions ( [ phase1 ] ) and ( [ phase2 ] ) are consistent only for a discrete set of wave numbers @xmath50 , which defines the spectrum of the quantum graph problem .",
    "since @xmath25 and @xmath51 represent the same wave function on the bond connecting the vertices @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the only difference is that @xmath33 is measured from vertex @xmath28 and @xmath52 is measured from vertex @xmath29 ) we have @xmath53 using ( [ psi ] ) we obtain @xmath54 therefore the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related according to @xmath57 the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath58 , ( @xmath56 and @xmath59 ) are considered different .",
    "this implies that the bonds of the graph are directed .",
    "equations ( [ ab ] ) can be written in matrix form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the @xmath63-dimensional vectors of coefficients , @xmath64 is a diagonal matrix in the @xmath65 space of directed bonds and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath18-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath68 the pairs of indices @xmath69 , @xmath70 , identifying the bonds of the graph @xmath71 , play the role of the indices of the matrix @xmath72 . alternatively",
    "the wave function can be written as a linear combination of plane waves scattering off @xmath21 .",
    "an incoming wave with normalized flux on the bond @xmath73 gives rise to a partial wave contribution scattering into bond @xmath19 according to @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the matrix element of the vertex scattering matrix @xmath76 , which distributes the incoming flux on bond @xmath73 into the bond @xmath19 .",
    "the wave function @xmath77 on the bond @xmath19 is a superposition of the partial waves ( [ scatt ] ) with amplitudes @xmath78 corresponding to the incoming flux on the bond @xmath73 towards the vertex @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath79 using the representation ( [ psi ] ) of @xmath80 in ( [ pssi ] ) and comparing coefficients yields @xmath81 substituting ( [ scatt ] ) into the boundary conditions , we obtain the vertex scattering matrix @xmath82 with @xmath83 we see that in the scaling case the matrix elements @xmath84 of the vertex scattering matrix @xmath85 are @xmath86-independent constants .",
    "the matrix element @xmath87 has the meaning of the reflection coefficient from the vertex @xmath21 along the bond @xmath19 , and the elements @xmath84 , @xmath88 are the transmission coefficients for transitions between different bonds .",

    "the number of possible periodic orbits increases exponentially with their lengths , ( or , equivalently , the number of scattering events ) with a rate @xmath107 which depends only on the topology of the graph .",
    "since the phase space of the system is bounded , the dynamics of such a particle is mixing @xcite .",
    "since we are focusing on the case @xmath112 , most of the classical periodic orbits on a graph are above - barrier reflection orbits as illustrated in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "in the context of ray splitting these orbits are also known as non - newtonian orbits @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of all non - newtonian orbits in our periodic - orbit expansions of individual eigenvalues discussed below is crucial for rendering these expansions exact .",
    "traversing the bond @xmath19 contributes the amount @xmath113 to the total action of the trajectory traced by the particle .",
    "these actions appear in the phases of the exact wave functions ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this connection means that the semiclassical ( eikonal ) form is exact for the quantum graph wave functions .",
    "more importantly , the amplitudes @xmath114 determine the matrix @xmath115 , and hence the scattering matrix @xmath92 . as a consequence , the `` closed bond sequence expansion '' ( [ exp1 ] )",
    "can be written explicitly as a periodic - orbit expansion in terms of the phases ( [ action ] ) , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the action of the prime periodic orbit @xmath15 composed of the partial actions @xmath118 of equation ( [ action ] ) accumulated along the periodic orbit @xmath15 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the first term in ( [ r ] ) describes the average behavior of the density of states while the second represents the fluctuations around the average .",
    "the amplitude of every periodic orbit @xmath15 contains the constant factor @xmath120 .",
    "this factor can be absorbed into the weight factor @xmath121 .",
    "thus , defining the reduced classical bond actions @xmath122 and the total reduced action @xmath123 accumulated along the periodic orbit @xmath15 , @xmath124 the final periodic - orbit expansion for the density of states for scaling systems can be written as @xmath125 in contrast with ( [ rho ] ) , the expression ( [ ro ] ) for the density of states is exact ; the action lengths @xmath126 and the weight factors @xmath127 are @xmath86-independent constants .",

    "the first term represents the average behavior of the staircase ; the second term describes the fluctuations around the average .",
    "since the scattering matrix ( [ s ] ) is a unitary matrix , its eigenvalues have the form @xmath131 .",

    "evaluated directly , the spectral determinant is a polynomial of the ( complex ) matrix elements ( [ tild ] ) with coefficients that are determined by the matrix elements ( [ tilt ] ) .",
    "factoring out the total phase ( [ theta0 ] ) of this polynomial , we obtain the spectral equation in the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 here , based on the reduced bond actions defined in ( [ redbond ] ) , @xmath139 is the total reduced action length of the graph , the frequencies @xmath140 are sums and differences of the reduced bond actions @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 are constants . for a general graph @xmath71 it is difficult to calculate the precise number of @xmath144-terms @xmath145 in ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "but an upper limit is given by the number of possible linear combinations of the @xmath146 reduced bond actions @xmath147 .",

    "since all the quantities on the right - hand side of ( [ kn ] ) are known , this formula provides an explicit representation of the roots @xmath158 of the spectral equation ( [ det ] ) in terms of the geometric characteristics and the classical properties of the graph .    in @xcite a mathematical proof",
    "is presented that assures us that ( [ kn ] ) converges .",
    "in addition it is proved in @xcite that ( [ kn ] ) converges to the exact spectral eigenvalues . both convergence and convergence to the correct results",
    "are illustrated with the help of a specific example in sect .",
    "it is also proved in @xcite that the series ( [ kn ] ) is only conditionally convergent .",
    "this means that for proper convergence the ordering of the terms in ( [ kn ] ) is important",
    ". proper convergence of ( [ kn ] ) is obtained if the terms in ( [ kn ] ) are ordered according to the code lengths of the periodic orbits @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the sum in ( [ kn ] ) is to be extended over all periodic orbits with code lengths smaller than or equal to @xmath109 which yields the approximation @xmath190 to @xmath158 .",
    "then , on the basis of the results obtained in @xcite , we have @xmath191 .",
    "this means that ( [ kn ] ) is exact .",
    "it is important to note here that the ordering of terms in ( [ kn ] ) is _ not _ according to their action lengths , but according to the lengths of the code words that code for the periodic orbits .",
    "this is intuitively understandable , since the code length @xmath109 is connected to the power @xmath103 of the @xmath192-matrix in ( [ exp1 ] ) according to @xmath193 .",
    "the expansion ( [ kn ] ) provides an explicit representation of the roots of the spectral equation ( [ det ] ) in terms of the geometric characteristics of the graph . in a similar way one can obtain explicit expansions for any power of the energy levels , @xmath194 , or any function of the eigenvalues @xmath195",
    "the coefficients @xmath196 in ( [ kn ] ) assume a particularly simple form in the case of linear graphs with zero sources , @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "both the vertices and the bonds of a linear graph can be naturally labeled by means of a single index such that @xmath199 , @xmath200, ... ,@xmath201 ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    ",@xmath213 , respectively . in this case , if a prime periodic orbit @xmath15 undergoes @xmath214 reflections from a vertex @xmath21 and @xmath215 transmissions through it , the weight coefficient in the expansion ( [ ro ] ) is @xcite @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the reflection coefficient from the vertex @xmath21 , and the product is taken over all the vertices encountered by the orbit @xmath15 . if a particle reflects from the vertex @xmath21 traveling along the bond @xmath218 , the reflection coefficient is @xmath219 we assumed dirichlet boundary conditions at the left and right dead ends of the graph .",

    "if , for a given orbit , the total number of reflections with @xmath221 is @xmath222 , then @xmath223 the two - vertex linear graph is trivial and corresponds to a quantum particle in a square - well box . a quantum particle moving in a scaling step potential as shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "gives rise to the simplest non - trivial graph , the scaling three - vertex linear graph , shown on the bottom of of fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "there is only one non - trivial reflection coefficient , @xmath224 all the periodic orbits of the three - vertex linear graph shown in fig .",
    "3 correspond one to one with words formed from a binary code with two letters @xmath225 and @xmath226 @xcite , where @xmath225 stands for a reflection of the orbit off the left - most vertex ( left - hand potential wall ) , and @xmath226 stands for a reflection off the right - most vertex ( right - hand wall ) .",
    "thus the @xmath225 , @xmath226 code is unique and complete . for this system",

    "is of the form ( [ eqn1 ] ) , ( [ eqn2 ] ) and the number of @xmath144-terms in @xmath232 ( in this case one term ) complies with the estimate ( [ estimate ] ) . because of @xmath233 , it is the spectral equation of a regular quantum graph .",
    "using the explicit form ( [ weight1 ] ) of the coefficients @xmath127 in the expansion ( [ kn ] ) , we obtain the explicit series expansion for every root @xmath158 of ( [ 3hydra ] ) .",
    "thus the spectrum of the scaling step potential shown in fig .  3 may be calculated explicitly and analytically with the help of ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "this by itself is a considerable advance in the theory of simple one - dimensional quantum systems which up to now could only be solved using graphical or numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the method and the convergence of the series expansion ( [ kn ] ) with the following concrete , dimensioned example of the scaling step potential of fig .  3 . choosing @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 , we computed the solutions @xmath156 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 of ( [ 3hydra ] ) using three different methods : ( i ) exact numerical , ( ii ) explicit periodic - orbit expansion ( [ kn ] ) of the individual eigenvalues and ( iii ) numerical integration using the @xmath192-matrix representation ( [ exp1 ] ) of the density of states . addressing ( i )",
    "we obtained the exact numerical values of the three selected roots of ( [ 3hydra ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "turning to method ( ii ) we re - computed these three eigenvalues using ( [ kn ] ) directly including progressively more periodic orbits in the expansion ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "the result is presented in table  1 which shows the values of @xmath156 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 computed with ( [ kn ] ) including periodic orbits coded by binary words of length @xmath242 , 10 , 15 and 20 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to including 23 , 261 , 4807 , and 111321 periodic orbits in the expansion ( [ kn ] ) , respectively .",
    "we observe that the accuracy does not improve monotonically , but that there is a definite overall improvement of accuracy with the code length . as a matter of fact ,",
    "as discussed above and shown mathematically in @xcite , the series ( [ kn ] ) converges , and converges to the exact results of @xmath158 in the limit of @xmath243 .    turning to method ( iii ) we note that due to the exponential proliferation of periodic orbits , it becomes progressively more difficult to compute the codes of longer periodic orbits .",
    "nevertheless , with the help of a numerical procedure , we are able to illustrate the convergence behavior of ( [ kn ] ) for code lengths much longer than @xmath244 . starting from ( [ exp1 ] )",
    "we compute the @xmath192-matrix numerically and perform all the steps leading up to ( [ kn ] ) numerically . in particular",
    "this method involves numerical computation of @xmath192-matrix powers and numerical integration over @xmath86 . within any given level of numerical accuracy",
    "this method is completely equivalent to the method of summing the orbits , but allows us to extend the computations such that we effectively include all periodic orbits up to code length @xmath245 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to @xmath246 periodic orbits , since the periodic orbits on the three - vertex linear graph are coded by a binary code .",
    "this estimate is substantiated by an analytical estimate of the number of periodic orbits .",
    "for the three - vertex graph the periodic orbits are binary necklaces over the two symbols @xmath247 and @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "the number of binary necklaces of length @xmath249 is given by @xcite @xmath250 where the symbol `` @xmath251 '' denotes `` @xmath103 is a divisor of @xmath249 '' , and @xmath252 is euler s totient function defined as the number of positive integers smaller than @xmath103 and relatively prime to @xmath103 with @xmath253 as a useful convention .",
    "an upper limit for @xmath107 is obtained if we use ( [ ncount ] ) in the case where @xmath249 is a prime number . in this case",

    "using the exact formula ( [ ncount ] ) for counting periodic orbits in ( [ topo ] ) and including periodic orbits with code lengths of up to @xmath259 , we found @xmath260 , consistent with the estimate ( [ esti ] ) .",
    "for @xmath245 , relevant for our numerical example , the asymptotic regime is not yet reached and we find @xmath261 .",
    "this value for @xmath107 can be used for a more refined estimate of the number of periodic orbits of length @xmath245 , @xmath262 .",
    "clearly , computing the codes of that many periodic orbits and summing them up in ( [ kn ] ) is beyond the storage capacity and power of any currently existing computer , but is apparently no obstacle to the numerical simulation of that many periodic orbits included in ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "figure  4 illustrates the rate of convergence of the eigenvalues @xmath156 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 obtained with method ( iii ) as a function of code length @xmath109 up to @xmath245 .",
    "shown is the relative error @xmath263 for @xmath264 , 10 and 100 .",
    "the error is seen to decrease on average as a function of increasing periodic - orbit length @xmath109 . from fig .",
    "4 we obtain approximately @xmath265 on average .    for a four - vertex linear graph , the spectral equation is @xmath266 where @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 , @xmath272 are the reflection coefficients at the vertices @xmath273 and @xmath274 , respectively . with @xmath275 , @xmath276 ,",
    "this spectral equation is of the form ( [ eqn1 ] ) , ( [ eqn2 ] ) and the number of @xmath144-terms in @xmath232 ( three in this case ) complies with ( [ estimate ] ) .",
    "for @xmath277 the four - vertex linear graph is regular . in this case",
    "the energy values of the four - vertex linear graph may be calculated exactly using the periodic - orbit expansion ( [ kn ] ) . according to fig .  5 the set of @xmath271 , @xmath272 values that fulfill ( [ max ] ) occupies a diamond - shaped area bounded by the functions @xmath278 .",
    "this observation proves that regular quantum graphs are an important , finite - measure subset of quantum graphs .",
    "the set of regular quantum graphs is much wider than the three- and four - vertex quantum graphs discussed in detail above . since , as indicated by ( [ 3hydra ] ) and",
    "( [ 4vertex ] ) , the amplitudes @xmath279 in ( [ eqn2 ] ) involve products of vertex reflection coefficients , and since the vertex reflection coefficients of a linear quantum graph ( via proper choice of the bond potentials ) are free parameters of the quantum graph , a finite - measure set of regular quantum graphs exists for _ any _ given linear graph .",
    "it is possible that more complex graph topologies , such as rings and stars , may also admit a set of regular quantum graphs .",
    "this topic is currently under investigation .",
    "in this paper we defined and studied a subset of quantum graphs : regular quantum graphs . regular quantum graphs",
    "satisfy the regularity condition ( [ reg ] ) which implies that the roots of the spectral equation are confined to regularly spaced root intervals .",
    "one and only one root is found per root interval .",
    "this property allows us to derive rigorous , converging periodic - orbit expansions for individual energy levels of regular quantum graphs .",
    "we often hear the comment that the expansion ( [ kn ] ) for @xmath158 can not possibly converge , since ( [ ro ] ) is divergent .",
    "this comment is invalid .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between ( [ ro ] ) and ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ro ] ) is a periodic - orbit expansion of the kernel of a functional ( a series of dirac delta `` functions '' ) , whereas ( [ kn ] ) is a periodic - orbit expansion of a simple c - number . on the level of ( [ ro ] )",
    "the concepts of convergence or divergence are not even defined . only after multiplying ( [ ro ] ) with a test function ( a function with compact support @xcite ) and integrating over @xmath86 , are the concepts of divergence and convergence defined . in this sense even ( [ ro ] )",
    "is convergent .",
    "this is also known as convergence in the distribution sense @xcite and leads to proper convergence in the usual sense of elementary undergraduate - level analysis after multiplying with the test function and integrating .",
    "thus ( [ kn ] ) converges in the usual sense of elementary calculus since our method of multiplying ( [ kn ] ) with @xmath86 and integrating from @xmath186 to @xmath159 is equivalent with multiplying ( [ ro ] ) with the test function @xmath280 and integrating over @xmath86 . since @xmath281 is a proper test function @xcite , the convergence of ( [ kn ] ) is no longer a mystery .",
    "another more serious comment concerns the sense in which quantum graphs are classically chaotic .",
    "quantum graphs are based on a one - dimensional network of vertices and bonds .",
    "therefore a dynamical liapunov exponent @xcite can not be defined in the traditional sense of exponentially diverging initially close trajectories . as",
    "explained in @xcite , however , this is no obstacle to associate a classical phase space with a quantum graph and to show that the classical dynamics in this phase space is mixing @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum graphs fulfill another property of quantum chaos , the exponential proliferation of classical periodic orbits as manifested by a positive topological entropy ( see sects .",
    "iii , iv ) .",
    "therefore , quantum graphs have been called `` paradigms of quantum chaos '' @xcite .",
    "inasmuch as the positive topological entropy is concerned regular quantum graphs qualify as quantum chaotic systems .",
    "regular quantum graphs do not show all the characteristics of `` fully developed '' quantum chaos .",
    "for instance , because of the existence of the forbidden zones @xmath183 ( see sect .",
    "iii ) they definitely do not show a wignerian nearest neighbor statistics .",
    "we do not believe that this is a problem since there is no universally accepted rigorous definition of quantum chaos that requires `` wignerian statistics '' as one of the necessary conditions .",
    "the only broadly accepted criterion is that `` quantum chaos '' deals with quantum systems that are chaotic in their classical limit .",
    "based on this criterion , together with the mixing property @xcite and the positive topological entropy ( see sect .",
    "iv ) regular quantum graphs definitely qualify as quantum chaotic systems , i.e. systems chaotic in the classical limit .    a more delicate point concerns the derivation of ( [ kn ] ) by integrating the fluctuating part in ( [ ro ] ) term - by - term .",
    "since the resulting periodic - orbit expansion is only conditionally convergent , this is reason for concern .",
    "we addressed this point from a rigorous mathematical point of view in @xcite .",
    "we were able to prove rigorously that the interchange of integration and summation in the @xmath86 integral of @xmath282 is allowed .",
    "thus , term - by - term integration of ( [ ro ] ) is justified , validating the final result ( [ kn ] ) .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the energy levels of a class of classically chaotic systems are expressed one by one with the help of convergent periodic - orbit expansions .",
    "studying specific examples of regular quantum graphs we proved that the class of regular quantum graphs is not empty ; that it is in fact an important finite - measure subset of quantum graphs .",
    "the explicit formulae of individual quantum energy levels obtained in this paper remind us of the einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) method @xcite for the quantization of integrable classical systems .",
    "but there are important differences .",
    "regular quantum graphs do not correspond to classically integrable systems .",
    "in fact , due to the importance of non - newtonian periodic orbits , the number of classical periodic orbits proliferates exponentially with the code - length .",
    "this proves that even regular quantum graphs , as defined by the regularity condition ( [ reg ] ) , are classically chaotic systems with a positive topological entropy .",
    "for one of our examples , the scaling step potential discussed in sect .",
    "iv , we computed estimates of the topological entropy analytically and numerically . in both cases it turned out to be positive and close to @xmath283 .",
    "this proves that , at least for the cases studied , the classical limit is chaotic .",
    "another difference to ebk theory is that the periodic orbits in regular quantum graphs are not confined to phase - space tori . finally , in contrast with ebk theory , a semiclassical theory which does not usually return exact results , our formulae are mathematically exact . in summary , despite the apparent complexity and exponential proliferation of the periodic orbits of regular quantum graphs , the organization of the roots of the spectral equation into regularly spaced intervals makes it possible to pinpoint every single energy eigenvalue of a regular quantum graph analytically and exactly by an explicit , convergent periodic - orbit expansion .",
