    "the compound is likely the most investigated material among all known superconducting pnictides .",
    "such an interest can be explained by both unusual physical properties inherent in this compound and availability of high quality single crystals . for the crystal growth most commonly a self - flux or the bridgman techniques",
    "are used @xcite .",
    "crystals grown by different techniques may vary in properties , in particular , in the pinning strength and , as a result , in the superconducting critical current density .",
    "the vortex pinning effects in the single crystals have been studied by transport , magnetic , magneto - optic and relaxation measurements ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the dependence of the pinning strength on environmental conditions ( temperature @xmath3 and magnetic field ) and the cobalt doping level has been investigated .",
    "it has been established that the samples have a large critical current density @xmath4 @xcite and a steep slope of the irreversibility line @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a symmetric shape of the pinning strength function @xmath6  versus field @xmath7  allowed the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to suggest the presence of a strong pinning nanostructure . by simultaneous analysis of the magnetization curves @xmath8 and the domain structure , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the twin boundaries play a role of such nanostructure .    in the present work we have investigated crystals with different co concentration ( from underdoped to overdoped ) using the magnetic field dependent modulated microwave absorption ( mmwa ) measurements .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the mmwa signal as a function of temperature , applied magnetic field and doping level .",
    "the relevant superconducting parameters , in particular , the critical current density have been estimated through numerical simulation of the experimental mmwa loops .",
    "furthermore , the mmwa method used in the present work has enabled , beyond the scope of the static magnetization measurements , not only to estimate the critical current density , but also to obtain additional insights into other effects , in particular on the influence of the thermal fluctuations and on the pinning center density .",
    "the theoretical analysis enables a distinction of pinning regimes in the studied single crystals with different co - doping , as well as to establish the origin of pinning centers . in particular , we have found clear indications for pinning of vortices on magnetically ordered nanoscale regions in the underdoped sample , whereas at higher co doping the pinning is related to local structural disorder and imperfections .",
    "single crystals with the co content @xmath0 , 0.09 and 0.11 were grown by the vertical bridgman technique .",
    "the preparation procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "the co concentration was determined by elemental analysis using energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) mode of a scanning electron microscope ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "all @xmath9  values referred to in this work are the co contents as revealed by edx . among all crystals",
    "the one with @xmath1 has the maximal superconducting critical temperature @xmath10  k ( fig . 1 and table 1 ) and thus is considered as an optimally doped ( op ) sample . respectively , the crystal with @xmath0  is denoted as underdoped ( ud ) , and the crystal with @xmath2  as overdoped ( od ) . in literature the optimal cobalt concentration @xmath9 for superconductivity in this series is reported to lie in the range from 6% to 10% depending on the method and regimes of preparation @xcite .",
    "note that for co concentration less than optimal two areas in the phase diagram @xmath3  vs @xmath9  can be distinguished : the one corresponding to the spin density wave ( sdw ) state ( at high temperature ) and the other corresponding to the superconducting state ( at low temperatures ) @xcite . according to a neutron scattering study @xcite , at these concentrations at @xmath11 the superconducting phase coexists with the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "the parameters of the superconducting transition were determined from the temperature dependence of ac susceptibility ( fig .",
    "the obtained values are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the onset temperature @xmath12  was determined as a temperature at which the ac susceptibility signal starts to deviate from the zero line .",
    "@xmath13  is the temperature at the half - height of the transition .",
    "the width of the transition @xmath14  is determined as the interval between the points of 10% and 90% of the total transition height .",
    "notably the ud sample has the broadest transition .",
    "temperature dependence of ac - susceptibility for three @xmath15  samples with different co concentration .",
    ", width=283 ]    there is no indication of the magnetic phase transition in the temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility in the studied samples .",
    "however for the ud single crystal it is observed in the resistivity @xmath16  measurements ( fig .",
    "2 ) which turn out to be a very sensitive probe of the magnetic phase transition manifesting in a clear minimum of the derivative curve @xmath17/dt$](for details see @xcite ) . in fact , following the procedure discussed in ref.@xcite , besides a transition to the magnetically ordered phase of sdw type at @xmath18  k corresponding to a minimum of @xmath17/dt$ ]  we can identify for the ud sample a structural transition at @xmath19  k from the minimum of the @xmath16  curve , and finally a sharp superconducting transition onset at @xmath20  k ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    .superconducting transition parameters for @xmath15  single crystals . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another origin of the large - scale defects and their influence on the critical current density was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "twin boundaries were considered as such extended defects in crystals with @xmath21  grown by self - flux technique . however , in crystals with higher co concentration no twin boundary structure was revealed . for our ud sample with @xmath22",
    "we therefore do not expect twin boundaries to occur .",
    "the decrease of @xmath23  and the change of the @xmath24  index towards the value of 2.5 corresponding to the -pinning ( at least in the high - field range ) in the op sample ( see table 2 ) is indicative of the pinning due to weak point defects@xcite .",
    "as suggested in ref.@xcite such pinning centers can be formed as a result of inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant atoms .",
    "it is therefore likely that also in our op and od samples the co impurity atoms serve as point pinning centers .",
    "this assumption is supported by the observation of the increase of the critical current @xmath23  and of the @xmath25  parameter , related to the center density , upon transition from op to od conditions .",
    "this can be naturally related with the increasing number of pinning centers .",
    "some enhancement of the @xmath23  value of the od crystal with the applied magnetic field is probably connected with the fish - tail effect observed frequently in ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we note however that the steepest irreversibility line is observed for the ud single crystal ( fig .",
    "4 ) suggesting that magnetically ordered phase inclusions are most effective pinning centers for superconducting vortices .    considering the data in table 2",
    "one should note that the parameter @xmath25  does not obey the @xmath26  dependence , because it is valid in the low field regime only .",
    "the @xmath25   even increases with @xmath27  for the ud and od samples . in the latter case",
    "the increase is most pronounced .",
    "for this sample also the @xmath4  increases which may be related to the fish - tail effect , as discussed above . the functional dependence",
    "@xmath28  is a consequence of the dependence of @xmath29  on the shear modulus @xmath30 , which in turn is proportional to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this relationship holds well in the low field regime .",
    "however , with increasing the field two additional effects may become relevant .",
    "the first effect is the softening of the shear modulus which yields a decrease of @xmath30 , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second effect pointed out in ref.@xcite is the formation of vortex bundles .",
    "both effects can result in the increase of the vortex shift @xmath31  under the action of thermal fluctuations , as compared with the rigid ( elastic ) vortex lattice .",
    "plausibly these effects may be responsible for an increase of @xmath25  and also of @xmath4  with magnetic field in the case of the od sample .",
    "it is possible to estimate the mean value of the thermal fluctuation amplitude @xmath32   and the distance between pinning centers @xmath33  on the basis of the obtained data and the known functional dependences .",
    "assuming that the above discussed @xmath34  dependence is valid at low fields and taking the value @xmath35 @xcite , we obtain the following estimates of @xmath36   and @xmath33  for the ud , op and od samples at @xmath37  k and @xmath38  t , respectively : @xmath39   , 25   , 28   ; and @xmath40 263   , 214   , 236   .",
    "one can see that the maximum distance between pinning centers , which corresponds to the minimum of their density , is revealed for the ud sample .",
    "this is in agreement with the minimum doping level in this sample and supports an assumption on the droplet form of pinning centers .",
    "a somewhat surprising increase of @xmath33  in the od sample , as compared with the op sample , suggests a possible clustering of dopant atoms . in this scenario",
    "the concentration of clusters is smaller than that of point defects .",
    "however they are more efficient as pinning centers yielding an increase of the critical current density ( see table 2 ) .",
    "a set of the single crystals with co concentration @xmath22 , 0.09 , and 0.11 was studied by the mmwa method .",
    "the analysis of the temperature and field dependences of the mmwa hysteresis amplitude enables to estimate the critical current density and the critical indices of the @xmath41  function , and to determine their dependence on temperature and co doping . on the basis of our data",
    "we conclude that in the underdoped crystal ( @xmath0 ) the pinning is of a  type related to the presence of regions of a nonsuperconducting ( magnetically ordered ) phase which provides the steepest slope of the irreversibility line for the underdoped sample . on the other hand , in the optimally doped and overdoped single crystals",
    "the pinning is caused by structural imperfections due to an inhomogeneous distribution of cobalt dopant .",
    "because of this , the -pinning is inherent in these crystals .",
