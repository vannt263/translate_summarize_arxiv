    "the study of weak - boson scattering events and the search for a heavy higgs boson will remain among the most important tasks of the lhc as long as the origin of the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak @xmath6 gauge symmetry has not been established by experiment .",
    "consequently much work has been devoted in recent years on devising methods for the separation of weak - boson scattering events , _",
    "i.e. _ the purely electroweak process @xmath7 , from background events like weak - boson pair production or top - quark decays .",
    "one such technique is forward jet tagging , the requirement to observe one or both of the two forward quark jets of the @xmath7 process  @xcite .",
    "however , additional characteristics of the signal must be employed to suppress backgrounds .    in a weak - boson scattering event",
    "no color is exchanged between the initial - state quarks .",
    "color coherence between initial- and final - state gluon bremsstrahlung then leads to a suppression of hadron production in the central region , between the two tagging - jet candidates of the signal  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to most background processes which typically involve color exchange in the @xmath1-channel and thus lead to enhanced particle production in the central region .",
    "it was hoped that resulting rapidity gaps in signal events ( large regions in pseudorapidity without observed hadrons ) could be used for background suppression .",
    "unfortunately , in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath8  tev at the lhc , the low signal cross sections require running at high luminosity , and then overlapping events in a single bunch crossing will likely fill a rapidity gap even if it is present at the level of a single @xmath4 collision .",
    "the different color structures of signal and background processes can be exploited even at high luminosity , however , if one defines rapidity gaps in terms of minijets ( of transverse momenta in the 2050  gev range ) instead of soft hadrons  @xcite .",
    "sizable background reductions via a minijet veto require the lowering of jet - energy thresholds to a range where the probability for additional parton emission becomes order unity . in a perturbative calculation",
    "the resulting condition , @xmath9 , indicates that one is leaving the validity range of fixed - order perturbation theory , and it becomes difficult to provide reliable theoretical estimates of minijet emission rates .",
    "gluon emission is governed by very different scales in signal as compared to background processes , due to their different color structures .",
    "thus a parton shower approach can not be expected to give reliable answers either unless both color coherence and the choice of scale are implemented correctly , for which additional information is needed .",
    "= 5.5 in = 3.5 in    in this paper we describe why and how a different process , @xmath10 production with subsequent @xmath11 decay , can be used to answer these questions experimentally at the lhc in a region of phase space very similar to the one relevant for weak - boson scattering .",
    "the dominant source of @xmath10 events is the @xmath12 qcd correction to drell - yan production .",
    "these events involve color exchange between incident partons , similar to the qcd backgrounds to weak - boson scattering events . in addition , there are electroweak sources of @xmath10 events , namely processes of the type @xmath0 which proceed via color - singlet @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath3 exchange .",
    "the @xmath3-exchange process includes the fusion of two virtual @xmath3 s to a @xmath14 boson , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zjjfeyn](e ) , and thus is very similar to higgs - boson production via weak - boson fusion . by tagging the two forward quark jets and requiring a large rapidity separation between the two ,",
    "the qcd background can be reduced to the level of the signal , or even below .",
    "it thus becomes possible to study minijet emission in electroweak and qcd @xmath10 production separately and to obtain the necessary experimental information for correct modeling of multiple parton emission in @xmath1-channel color - singlet and color - octet exchange .",
    "our analysis is based on full tree - level monte - carlo programs at the parton level .",
    "we start out in section  [ sec : two ] by describing these tools . simulating the minijet emission in @xmath10 events",
    "requires a calculation of @xmath15-jet cross sections . while the qcd backgrounds  @xcite and the @xmath10 signal process  @xcite have been available in the literature , we here present a first calculation of electroweak @xmath16 production ( and crossing related processes ) . in section  [ sec : three ] , using the @xmath10 programs , we identify forward - jet - tagging criteria which lower the qcd backgrounds to approximately the level of the signal .",
    "we also show how tagging - jet and decay - lepton distributions can be used to separate the signal from the background on a statistical basis  @xcite .",
    "having defined the hard scattering processes to be investigated , we then turn to the different minijet patterns in signal and background events in section  [ sec : four ] .",
    "two characteristics differentiate between signal and qcd background , the angular distribution of minijets and their typical transverse momenta .",
    "we discuss the probability for finding minijets in hard @xmath10 events and describe how this probability and the minijet multiplicity depend on the phase space region of the hard scattering event .",
    "final conclusions are then drawn in section  [ sec : five ] .",
    "two aspects of minijet ( or soft - gluon ) emission in @xmath10 production need to be modelled correctly in order to describe soft - jet activity in these hard scattering events : the angular distribution of soft emitted partons which reflects the color coherence specific to the underlying hard scattering event , and the momentum scale governing soft - gluon emission .",
    "both aspects are taken into account correctly by using full tree - level matrix elements for all subprocesses which contribute to @xmath17 production .",
    "our basic signal process is @xmath14 bremsstrahlung in quark(anti)quark scattering via @xmath3 , @xmath14 , or photon exchange , qq qqz , z^+^-(=e , ) and crossing related subprocesses .",
    "subsequent leptonic @xmath14 decay allows identification of the signal .",
    "the lepton distributions and the tagging of the two ( anti)quark jets provide a good discrimination against qcd backgrounds ( see below ) . in the phase - space region of interest the charged - current ( cc ) process of fig .  [",
    "fig : zjjfeyn ] dominates over neutral - current ( nc ) exchange , mainly because of the larger coupling of the quarks to the @xmath3 as compared to the photon and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath19 vertex in the feynman graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : zjjfeyn](e ) then leads to a contribution which very closely resembles higgs - boson production in weak - boson scattering , @xmath20 , and thus our signal process becomes a laboratory for studying qcd aspects of weak - boson scattering .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for our calculation of the @xmath21 signal .",
    "all cc and nc subprocesses are added , and finite @xmath14-width effects are included .",
    "when requiring a large rapidity separation between the two quark jets ( tagging jets ) the resulting large dijet invariant mass severely suppresses any @xmath22-channel processes which might give rise to the dijet pair .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath1-channel weak - boson exchange only .",
    "also note that graphs with @xmath22-channel electroweak - boson exchange involve color exchange between the incident partons and have a counterpart in the qcd backgrounds to be considered below , but with electroweak - boson exchange replaced by gluon exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "thus the electroweak @xmath22-channel processes may be considered as a minor correction to the qcd backgrounds .    in order to determine the minijet activity in signal events we need to evaluate the @xmath25 real parton emission corrections to the signal .",
    "we have performed a first calculation of the @xmath26 subprocess qqqqg^+^- [ eq : qqzqqg ] and all crossing related subprocesses .",
    "production of the @xmath27 pair via @xmath14 and @xmath13 exchange is considered . for cc processes , such as @xmath28 ,",
    "52 feynman graphs contribute to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qqzqqg ] ) ; for nc processes 112 feynman graphs need to be included .",
    "the resulting amplitudes are evaluated numerically using the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite and have been checked against amplitudes generated with madgraph  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the various subprocesses are evaluated and added in a monte - carlo program whose phase - space generator and overall normalization have been tested by comparing to an analogous @xmath29 generator  @xcite .      given the clean leptonic @xmath14 decay signature , the main background to electroweak @xmath31-jet events arises from @xmath32 real emission qcd corrections to the drell - yan process @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath10 events these background processes include    @xmath34    via @xmath1-channel gluon exchange and all crossing related processes  @xcite .",
    "we shall call these processes the `` qcd @xmath10 '' background .",
    "the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath15-jet processes , which we need for our modeling of minijet activity in the qcd @xmath10 background , have been calculated in refs .",
    "similar to the treatment of the signal processes we use a parton - level monte - carlo program based on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to model the qcd @xmath10 and @xmath17 backgrounds .    for all our numerical results we have chosen @xmath35 , @xmath36  gev , and @xmath37 , which translates into @xmath38  gev and @xmath39 when using the tree - level relations between these input parameters .",
    "the running of the strong - coupling constant is evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath40 .",
    "mrs  a structure functions  @xcite are used throughout , and the factorization scale is chosen as the minimal transverse momentum of a defined jet in the event ( see below ) . for the @xmath41 signal the scale of the strong coupling constant is taken to be the minimal transverse momentum of any of the three final state partons . for the @xmath30 qcd backgrounds , with @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "colored partons in the final state , the overall strong - coupling constant factors are taken as @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ the transverse momentum of each additional parton is taken as the relevant scale for its production , irrespective of the hardness of the underlying scattering event .",
    "this procedure guarantees that the same @xmath45 factors are used for the hard part of a @xmath10 event , independent of the number of additional minijets , and at the same time the small scales relevant for soft - gluon emission are implemented .",
    "before analyzing the minijet activity in signal and background events we need to identify the phase - space region for hard scattering events , @xmath46 with two hard jets in the final state . in a tree - level simulation , processes with exactly two final - state partons need to be considered for this purpose . in the actual experiments",
    "this would correspond to two - jet inclusive events .",
    "we are interested in electroweak @xmath10 production as a model process for weak - boson scattering .",
    "thus we first need to identify the phase - space region where the @xmath47-fusion graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : zjjfeyn](e ) becomes important .",
    "this question has been analyzed before for electroweak @xmath48 production at the ssc , and we closely follow the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "the acceptance cuts to be discussed below are chosen with the design of the atlas and cms detectors at the lhc in mind  @xcite .",
    "the leptonic @xmath14 decay is a crucial part of the signal , and and we therefore consider events with two opposite - sign leptons , @xmath49 , of sufficient transverse momentum , in the central part of the detector , and well isolated from any jets : @xmath50 here @xmath51 denotes the pseudorapidity , and @xmath52 is the lepton - jet separation in the pseudorapidity azimuthal - angle plane .",
    "in addition , the dilepton invariant mass must be consistent with @xmath14 decay , @xmath53 in the following , unless stated otherwise , any parton satisfying the transverse momentum , pseudorapidity , and separation requirements @xmath54 will be called a jet .    rotate    1 1    event rates after these acceptance cuts are shown in the first row of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "lepton and jet differential distributions for the signal ( solid lines ) and the background ( dashed lines ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ figone ] .",
    "the lepton rapidity distribution of fig .  [ figone](a ) shows that signal leptons are more centrally produced than those in qcd @xmath10 events .",
    "concentrating on central leptons ( @xmath55 ) does little harm to the signal while reducing the background by more than a factor of two",
    ". a stronger reduction of the background is achieved by exploiting the larger pseudorapidity separation of the two jets in the @xmath1-channel electroweak - boson exchange of the signal as compared to the qcd background ( see fig .  [ figone](b ) ) .",
    "finally , the transverse - momentum distribution of the softer of the two jets is shown in fig .",
    "[ figone](c ) .",
    "the large jet separation of the signal is typical also for weak - boson scattering events , and we therefore require at least three units of pseudorapidity between the jet definition cones of the two tagging jets .",
    "in addition , the leptons are required to occupy the pseudorapidity range between the two cones , and the two tagging jets must fall into opposite hemispheres of the detector . with a cone radius of 0.7 for each of the jets",
    "these conditions can be summarized as    [ cut2a ] @xmath56    finally , the jet @xmath57 distributions of fig .",
    "[ figone](c ) suggest a more stringent transverse - momentum requirement on the tagging jets as another means of enhancing the signal with respect to the background .",
    "we find that a cut at 70  gev would be optimal for the significance of the signal .",
    "however , such a high cut would take us well outside the acceptable range for double jet tagging of weak - boson scattering events .",
    "the incident longitudinally polarized weak bosons in @xmath20 events lead to substantially lower transverse momenta of the tagging jets than the transversely polarized incident @xmath3 s in the @xmath10 signal ( median @xmath58  gev _ vs. _",
    "@xmath59  gev for the softer of the two tagging jets ) .",
    "since we want to explore events which are as similar as possible to longitudinal weak - boson scattering events , we compromise at @xmath60    .signal and background cross sections @xmath61 for @xmath30 events in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath62  tev .",

    "cross sections and signal to background ratios for three examples of more stringent cuts are shown in the last three rows of table  [ table1 ] ; it will be possible to prepare event samples with very different fractions of electroweak- and qcd - induced @xmath10 events",
    ". the availability of both signal- and background - dominated event samples will then allow the study of radiation patterns of minijets in both @xmath1-channel color - singlet exchange events ( signal ) and in events which are due to color exchange between the incident partons ( qcd background ) .",
    "with regard to the separation of signal and qcd background , it should also be noted that the calculation of full nlo qcd corrections is possible for the @xmath10 signal with presently available techniques ; at most box diagrams need to be considered at the one - loop level .",
    "thus it can reasonably be expected that the signal will be predictable with good accuracy by the time the lhc can perform these measurements .",
    "given the measured event rate and the predicted signal rate the composition of the @xmath10 events should be known at the 10% level or better .",

    "another striking difference arises in the transverse - momentum distribution of the third jet ; the additional jet is substantially harder in the qcd background than in the signal .",
    "this difference is hardly noticeable in the shape of the @xmath68 distribution .",

    "the situation is very different for the qcd background . here",

    "multiple minijet emission will appear in this transverse - momentum range .",
    "thus the @xmath1-channel color - singlet exchange of the signal and the color exchange of the qcd background lead to dramatically different minijet activity in individual events ; color - singlet - exchange events will sport a low occupancy of fairly soft jets in the forward and backward region with very little activity in the central region , while a typical qcd background event will have several minijets of transverse momentum above 20  gev , predominantly in the central region , between the the two tagging jets .    in the analogous case of weak - boson scattering events",
    "the same pattern arises , and a veto on central minijets can be used to suppress the backgrounds  @xcite .",

    "the precise definition of a minijet veto will depend on detector performance , multiplicity of minijets from overlapping events  @xcite , and detailed signal and background characteristics .",

    "any model should preserve the two salient features of the qcd matrix - element calculation : color coherence as reflected by the angular distributions of fig .",
    "[ figthree](a ) and the different @xmath57 scales for extra parton emission that we have found for the signal and the background .    in the following we use the two models discussed in ref .",
    "the first one is provided by the `` truncated shower approximation '' ( tsa )  @xcite .",
    "when several soft gluons are emitted in a hard scattering event their transverse momenta tend to cancel , leading to a regularization of the small @xmath57 singularity which is present when considering single - parton emission only . in the tsa",
    "these effects are simulated by replacing the tree - level three - jet differential cross section , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 here the parameter @xmath89 is chosen to correctly reproduce the tree - level two - jet cross section , @xmath72 , within the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cut1a]-[cut2b ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath89 is fixed by the matching condition _ 2 = _ 0^ dp_t3 .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath90  gev for the @xmath10 signal and @xmath91  gev for the qcd @xmath10 background .",
    "the much larger value for the latter again reflects the higher intrinsic momentum scale governing soft - gluon emission in the qcd background .",
    "this difference would be enhanced even more by requiring larger dijet invariant masses for the two tagging jets , as in the final two rows of table  [ table1 ] ( see also below ) .",

    "however , it is easily identifiable via the leptonic @xmath14-decay mode , and it enjoys a large production cross section ( of order 3080 fb ) in a phase - space region where qcd backgrounds are of comparable size . even when operating the lhc at 10% of the design luminosity ( _ i.e. _ collecting 10  fb@xmath110 per year ) a combined signal and background sample of more than 1000 events will be available to find differences between events with and without color exchange in the @xmath1-channel . by varying the machine luminosity , the minijet background from overlapping events in the same bunch crossing , and methods for its suppression ,",
    "can be studied at the same time  @xcite .",
    "color - singlet exchange in the @xmath1-channel , as encountered in higgs - boson production by weak - boson fusion and in our @xmath10 signal , leads to soft - minijet activity which differs strikingly from that expected for the qcd backgrounds in at least two respects .",
    "first , @xmath1-channel color - singlet exchange leads to soft gluon emission mainly in the forward and backward regions , between the beam directions and the forward tagging jets  @xcite . the central region between the two tagging jets , which also contains the two @xmath14-decay leptons , remains largely free of minijets .",
    "for the backgrounds , @xmath1-channel color exchange leads to minijet emission mainly in the central region  @xcite .",
    "a second distinction is the typical transverse momentum of the produced minijets .",
    "extra gluon emission in @xmath10 production is suppressed by a factor @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the typical scale of the hard process and @xmath113 is the minimal transverse momentum required for a parton to qualify as a minijet . the jet - transverse - momentum scale below which multiple minijet emission must be expected is set by @xmath114 .",
    "the hard scale @xmath112 is set by the momentum transfer to the color charges in @xmath10 production . for the signal",
    "no color is exchanged , and hence the color charges are accelerated by the same amount as the incoming ( anti)quarks . hence , @xmath112 is related to the average @xmath57 of the two tagging jets and is of order 100  gev only . for the background processes , on the other hand",
    ", color is exchanged in the annihilation of the initial quarks and/or gluons .",
    "therefore the momentum transfer to the color charges is of the order of the dijet invariant mass of the two tagging jets and is in the tev range . as a result multiple minijet emission becomes important in background processes in the 2050  gev @xmath57 range whereas the corresponding scale for the signal is of order a few gev only  @xcite .",
    "these qualitative arguments are directly confirmed by our perturbative analysis .",
    "we find , for example , that minijet emission in the qcd background increases with the invariant mass of the two tagging jets , and that it occurs with much higher probability than for the signal even though the transverse momenta of the tagging jets are somewhat larger in the electroweak @xmath10 signal than in the qcd background .",
    "this pattern is naturally explained by taking @xmath115 for the background and @xmath116 for the signal .",
    "a precise modeling of multiple minijet emission in hard qcd processes is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , any monte - carlo program which addresses this question should incorporate the above findings and agree with the fixed - order perturbation - theory results at sufficiently large minijet transverse momenta .",
    "@xmath10 events at the lhc can then be used to fine - tune the monte carlos in the low @xmath57 range .",
    "because of its intrinsically small scale , fixed - order qcd should be reliable for the signal process down to minijet transverse momenta in the 1020  gev range , a point which can be tested experimentally by comparing the rate of low minijet multiplicity @xmath5-jet inclusive events with the signal predictions ( to nlo if available by the time the lhc starts running ) .",
    "minijet activity in high - mass qcd events is most easily probed by studying two - jet inclusive events ( without an accompanying @xmath14 boson ) , as is already possible now , at the tevatron  @xcite . however",
    ", such events will have a composition of quark- and gluon - initiated subprocesses different from backgrounds to weak - boson scattering events .",
    "a test run to prepare for the latter can be performed with the @xmath10 qcd backgrounds studied here .",
    "samples of such events can be prepared either by subtracting the known electroweak @xmath10 production cross section , by relying on differing shapes of kinematical distribution at the @xmath5-jet level , or by going to relatively low dijet - mass regions where the qcd @xmath10 background is the dominant source of @xmath10 events .",
    "most likely a combination of all of these will be needed to obtain an understanding of the minijet activity in hard scattering events at a quantitative level .",
    "this knowledge can then be used to devise a minijet trigger for the higgs - boson search at the lhc .",
    "our findings here indicate that a minijet veto should work not only for the heavy higgs - boson search , where the production of a high - mass system lets one expect strong gluon radiation in background events , but also for the production of light weak bosons via @xmath47 or @xmath117 fusion .",
    "this weak boson need not be the @xmath14 studied here but could be an intermediate - mass higgs boson .",
    "the use of a minijet veto appears to be a promising technique for the entire higgs mass range , from the 100  gev range of supersymmetric models to the tev scale .",
    "we thank tim stelzer for his aid in testing our matrix elements by a comparison with madgraph .",
