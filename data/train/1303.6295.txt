    "understanding the nature of the excitations in both the normal and the superconducting states has been a heavily studied research topic in high - temperature superconductors , for it might hold the key to the pairing mechanism for unconventional superconductivity , the `` holy grail '' of the field .",
    "it is no doubt that the spin physics plays a crucial role in this aspect due to the presence of some magnetically ordered states in the parent compounds .",
    "after the doping is introduced , the superconductivity emerges with the disappearance of the ` parent ' magnetic order .",
    "since this sort of phase diagram is so universal , it is reasonable to believe that the spin fluctuations originating from the ` parent ' magnetic order persist even as the long - ranged order is killed , and they might take a part in the formation of the cooper pairs .",
    "a number of experiments support the ubiquity of the spin fluctuations among cuprates , heavy fermions , and iron pnictides.@xcite    the new high temperature superconductor discovered in 2008 , the iron pnictide , has received a tremendous amount of attention in the past few years.@xcite at first sight , this category of materials seems to be incompatible with superconductivity .",
    "the key element , fe@xmath1 , has six electrons in its 3@xmath2 orbitals , and hund s coupling should favor ferromagnetism ( parallel spins ) instead of spin - singlet superconductivity ( anti - parallel spins ) .",
    "indeed there were some theoretical proposals of the iron pnictide being a spin - triplet @xmath3-wave superconductor,@xcite but this was ruled out very quickly by experiments .",
    "the hybridizations between the @xmath2 orbitals of the fe atom and the @xmath3 orbitals of the as atom result in a strong suppression of the effect of hund s coupling.@xcite consequently , the magnetic moment of the fe atom is surprisingly small , which prevents the occurrences of ferromagnetism as well as spin - triplet superconductivity",
    ". experimentally it has been found that the fe atom has a magnetic moment ranging from 0.5 to 3.3 @xmath4 in different families of the iron pnictides , depending on the details of their electronic structures .",
    "this sensitivity of the fe moment on the electronic structures reflects the hybridization effect discussed above .",
    "another crucial consequence due to the strong hybridization is the multiorbital nature . as seen in density functional theory ( dft ) calculations,@xcite the fermi surface of the iron pnictides dissects into different pockets centered around high symmetry points of the brillouin zone @xmath5 and @xmath6 . a closer look into the band structures makes it obvious that the eigenstates on different parts of the fermi surface have very different weights in the fe @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "in fact , it is just this multiorbital nature that makes the iron pnictides distinct from the cuprates .     and temperature @xmath7 .",
    "we use @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 to label the structural , magnetic , and superconducting phase transition temperatures , respectively . the corresponding crystal and magnetic structures of each phase are displayed . ]",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows a generic phase diagram of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "let us first discuss the part that is remarkably similar to that of the cuprates .",
    "the parent compound has a stripe - like antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order with the ordering wave vector @xmath11 , while superconductivity appears as the long - ranged afm order is suppressed by either doping or pressure .",
    "however , a new ingredient that is not universally present in the cuprates is the emergence of a structural phase transition , across which the crystal symmetry goes from tetragonal to orthorhombic .",
    "the structural phase transition spontaneously breaks the lattice @xmath0 rotational symmetry and always occurs at a temperature ( @xmath8 ) which is the same as or higher than the magnetic transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this unusual inequality ( @xmath12 ) has motivated theorists to propose either orbital or spin fluctuations as the effective cause .",
    "the difficulty to resolve this controversy is that both theories end up with the same macroscopic states breaking exactly the same @xmath0 symmetries , so that they are indistinguishable in most bulk measurements of the thermodynamic properties .    in this review ,",
    "we focus on the orbital physics emerging from this multiorbital nature which is new and unique in the iron pnictides .",
    "it is shown that the elementary excitations of the orbital fluctuations is fundamentally different from those of the spin fluctuations , which might give us a chance to resolve the nature of the quantum fluctuations from various types of spectroscopies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : orbital ] introduces the ferro - orbital order of fe @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals as the effective cause of the structural phase transition . in particular",
    ", we will show how this orbital order arises from both the strong - coupling and the weak - coupling limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : excitation ] , the elementary excitations from the quantum fluctuations associated with the ferro - orbital order are discussed , and the experiments that might have detected these orbital fluctuations are summarized in sec .",
    "4 . finally ,",
    "a concluding remark is given in sec .",
    "the ground state manifold of the magnetically ordered phase of the iron - based superconductors is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 refers to the arbitrary direction of the ordered moment in spin space , whereas @xmath17 represents the two - fold degeneracy of the ordering wave vector @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this magnetic order not only breaks the usual @xmath16 spin rotational symmetry , but also breaks the @xmath0 rotational symmetry of the tetragonal lattice . from a symmetry argument ,",
    "accompanying the onset of the magnetic order , a structural phase transition could occur and reduce the crystal symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic .",
    "furthermore , a more intriguing possibility is that the @xmath0 symmetry breaking can arise even without breaking the spin @xmath16 symmetry . indeed , experimentally the structural phase transition temperature @xmath8 is higher than the nel temperature @xmath9 in many iron - based superconductors .",
    "the phase sandwiched between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is usually called the nematic phase , which proliferates in many strongly correlated systems.@xcite in its original meaning , the nematic order is characterized by a state that breaks a _ continuous _ rotational symmetry but remains invariant under other symmetry operations .",
    "however , in real materials , the underlying symmetry of the system becomes discrete due to the presence of the lattice .",
    "so the nematic order only breaks a _",
    "discrete _ rotational symmetry , in particular the @xmath0 rotational symmetry of the two - dimensional square lattice considered here .",
    "understanding the origin of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking associated with the structural phase transition is a fundamental question in the iron - based superconductors . recently a lot of experimental efforts have been made to uncover the electronic anisotropy in this nematic phase .",
    "evidences from transport measurement,@xcite angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes),@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite all suggest that strong electronic anisotropy exist above @xmath9 ( for a review , see ref .  ) , and in some cases , it even persists above @xmath8 with or without uniaxial strains@xcite .",
    "we note here that the orthorhombic distortion is very small , less than 1% of the original lattice .",
    "so it is difficult to ascribe the strong electronic anisotropy to lattice distortions .",
    "therefore it is generally agreed that the symmetry breaking has an electronic origin , which is usually termed as the electron nematic order.@xcite    in this section , we focus on theories in which the orbital order is an effective cause of the electron nematicity.@xcite as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , iron - based superconductors are intrinsically multiorbital systems , and dft calculations@xcite show that all five fe 3@xmath2 orbitals have significant weights on the fermi surface . among five @xmath2 orbitals ,",
    "two of them , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are special from the symmetry aspect .",
    "each of them has only the @xmath20 symmetry , but the system retains the @xmath0 symmetry if they are degenerate .",
    "moreover , they make dominant contributions on the fermi surface compared to the other three orbitals .",
    "therefore the minimal model for iron based superconductors is a two - orbital model with the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals.@xcite in such a model , we can define the ferro - orbital order parameter as the difference between the occupation numbers of the two orbitals , @xmath21 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath22 lifts the orbital degeneracy and changes sign under the @xmath0 rotation .",
    "therefore it can be identified as the electron nematic order parameter , which gives rise to the structural phase transition .",
    "what is the microscopic mechanism driving the orbital order ? before answering this question , we need to address the important issue regarding the strength of electron correlations . because various experiments have characterized the iron - based superconductors as intermediately correlated metals,@xcite both strong - coupling@xcite and weak - coupling@xcite theories have their own merits .",
    "so we will use arguments from both aspects to show how the orbital order arises in sec .",
    "[ sec : strong ] and [ sec : weak ] , respectively .",
    "here we briefly mention the spin - based scenario for the structural phase transition . in this line of thinking ,",
    "the nematic order is induced by magnetic fluctuations , termed as the spin nematic order .",
    "these theories can be formulated either from a strong - coupling @xmath23-@xmath24 heisenberg model,@xcite or from a weak - coupling model consisting of electron and hole pockets.@xcite although starting from the opposite limits , both approaches end up with the same effective landau - ginzberg model , in which the nematic order can be identified as a @xmath17 order related to magnetic fluctuations centered at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "once the nematic order sets in , the magnetic fluctuations will be enhanced at a preferable wavevector without the onset of the long - ranged magnetic order .",
    "this approach naturally explains the proximity of structural and magnetic transitions . from a symmetry point of view , both the orbital order and spin nematic order break the same @xmath0 rotational symmetry .",
    "thus they are allowed to couple to each other directly .",
    "namely , the onset of one order parameter will induce the other .",
    "it is therefore very difficult to distinguish their roles in causing the electron nematic order .",
    "however , a key point to be emphasized is that orbital order gives a new energy scale that is distinct from spin physics . as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : excitation ] and [ sec : expt ] , orbital order leads to a new type of elementary excitations that has strong support from experiments .",
    "the idea of orbital order in the insulating limit is pioneered by the seminal work of kugel and khomskii.@xcite we will apply their approach to the iron - based superconductors , in particular a two - orbital model consisting of @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals at quarter filling . on each site",
    "there is one electron occupying any state that is a linear combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "formally , such a state is written as = ( ) xz + ( ) yz .",
    "due to the two - fold degeneracy , we can introduce an orbital pseudospin operator @xmath25 with @xmath26 to represent the two orbital states , where xz = (    c1 + 0    ) , yz = (    c0 + 1    ) .    according to kugel and khomskii,@xcite this orbital degeneracy",
    "can be lifted by three types of interactions in a lattice system .",
    "the first one is the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction arising from the quadrupole moment of the 3@xmath2 orbitals . in terms of orbital pseudospins @xmath25",
    ", it takes the form of _ qu = _",
    "ij j^z_ij _",
    "i^z _ j^z + j^x_ij _ i^x _ j^x + j^zx_ij ( _ i^z _ j^x +",
    "[ eq : heisenberg ] depending on the values of the exchange constants @xmath27 , different orbitally ordered states can be stabilized .",
    "if @xmath28 is negative and the leading energy scale of the system , ferro - orbital order will develop at low temperature , where @xmath29 .",
    "the second one is the electron - phonon coupling , _ ep & = & _ k _ k a_k^a_k - _ k , i e^-ikr_i g_k ( a_k+a_k^ ) _ i^z + ^2 - _",
    "the fist term represents free phonons with frequency @xmath30 , while the second term describes the electron - phonon interaction , with @xmath31 being the coupling strength .",
    "we have separated the contributions from homogeneous distortions in the last two terms . here",
    "@xmath32 is the orthorhombic distortion ; @xmath33 is the elastic constant ; and @xmath34 is the coupling strength",
    ". we can formally integrate out the lattice variables and derive an effective model of pseudospins , ( _ i , _ j ) = _ ij _ ij ^z_i ^z_j [ eq : ising ] where the exchange constants _",
    "ij = - - _ k e^ik(r_i - r_j ) .",
    "we note that only the orthorhombic distortion that couples to @xmath35 is considered here . as a result , the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) takes the form of an ising model . in reality",
    ", there is another phonon mode that couples to @xmath36 .",
    "inclusion of this coupling will produce terms of the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 , resulting in an effective hamiltonian similar to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) . nevertheless , since ferro - orbital order and the accompanying orthorhombic distortion are the leading instability in our system , it is sufficient to focus only on @xmath35 .",
    "similar to the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction , electron - phonon interaction also leads to a ferro - orbitally ordered phase at low temperature .",
    "the last type of interaction is the exchange interaction .",
    "unlike the first two interactions , which can be expressed exclusively by orbital pseudospins @xmath25 , the exchange interaction also involves the spin degrees of freedom . in many systems , it is the dominant energy scale for orbital and spin orders .",

    "the energy of each orbital and spin configuration can be calculated using second - order perturbation theory .",

    "we define the intra - orbital hopping amplitudes of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the inter - orbital hopping vanishes from symmetry arguments .",
    "we need to consider three distinct orbital configurations as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual ] . if both sites are occupied by the same orbitals [ fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual](a ) and ( b ) ] , the exchange interaction is strongly antiferromagnetic ( afm ) . we can write down an effective spin - only heisenberg model @xmath52 , where @xmath53 if @xmath13 occupies both sites , while @xmath54 when we have @xmath14 orbitals on both sites .",
    "here @xmath49 is the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion .",
    "in contrast , if different orbitals occupy the two sites [ fig .  [",
    "fig : virtual](c ) and ( d ) ] , the exchange becomes weakly ferromagnetic ( fm ) , with ( _ i , _ j ) = ( - ) _ i _ j - _ i _ j , [ eq : fm ] in the limit that the hund coupling @xmath27 is much smaller than the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , different orbital configurations correspond to different spin configurations , and vice versa .",

    "if we further assume that @xmath55 according to the spatial anisotropy of the orbitals , it is found that the state with the @xmath13 ferro - orbital order and afm spin order will have the lowest energy .",

    "consequently , the magnetic exchange is weak and there is no magnetic order . at low temperature , we have a ferro - orbital order of either @xmath13 or @xmath14 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_strong](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the effective spin model becomes an anisotropic @xmath58-@xmath59-@xmath24 heisenberg model .",

    "we note that our analysis is based on strong anisotropy in the hopping amplitudes of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "this assumption is confirmed by dft calculations@xcite in which a similar scenario is also proposed .",
    "experimentally inelastic neutron scattering results@xcite give further support that the spin physics in iron pnictides is governed by a strongly anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "now the question is whether orbital order can exist in the absence of the long - range magnetic order .",
    "first , we note that the orbital order is an ising order whereas the spin order is an @xmath16 order . in a true two - dimensional system ,",
    "orbital order can occur at finite temperature whereas spin order only sets in at @xmath62 .",
    "turning on couplings along the third dimension , we can drive the magnetic transition close to the orbital transition .",
    "nevertheless , there exists the nematic phase with nonzero orbital order but no magnetic order .",
    "this argument is also used by some theories on the basis of spin fluctuations.@xcite numerically , such a sequence of phase transitions is found in both exact diagonalization@xcite and monte - carlo@xcite studies of the spin - orbital model .",
    "second , from our discussion , orbital order can be driven by other interactions , like electron - phonon and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions , in addition to the spin - orbital couplings .",
    "therefore orbital order transition can have a distinct energy scale from the magnetic transition , and happen at a much higher temperature .",
    "this is indeed the case in many other transition metal oxides.@xcite       ferro - orbital order .",

    "however , the normal state of the iron - based superconductors remains metallic . as a consequence ,",
    "the opposite weak - coupling limit is worthy of being studied as well .",
    "let us examine the fermi surface of the iron - based superconductors . in the unfolded brillouin zone that contains one fe atom per unit cell",
    ", there is a circular hole pocket at the zone center @xmath63 , whereas two elliptical electron pockets appear at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_weak](a ) ] . here for simplicity we have ignored the second hole pocket at @xmath5 and a third possible hole pocket at the zone corner @xmath66 . in terms of a two - orbital model ,",
    "the eigenstates on different locations of the fermi surfaces have different weights of @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "one prominent feature here is that under a @xmath67 rotation , the shape of the fermi surface is invariant , but the dominant orbital weight changes between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this condition is strictly enforced because the two orbitals exchange with each other under the @xmath0 rotation .",
    "it is then obvious that an electron nematic order can be captured by a ferro - orbital order.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_weak](b ) , if @xmath13 orbital has a larger occupation number , the hole pocket will be elongated along the @xmath51 direction and shortened along the @xmath56 direction .",
    "such a fermi surface distortion is a hallmark of the nematic order .",
    "meanwhile , the electron pocket at @xmath68 shrinks while the one at @xmath69 enlarges .",
    "similarly for the @xmath14 orbital order , the opposite takes place [ fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_weak](c ) ] .",
    "so in this multiorbital system , orbital order naturally leads to an electronic nematicity .",
    "this ferro - orbital order has an important consequence in picking up the preferred wavevector of the stripe - like afm order . in this itinerant model , the magnetic order",
    "is induced by the nesting between the hole and electron pockets . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_weak](a ) , for the isotropic fermi surface , the nesting can happen between either of the two electron pockets .",
    "furthermore , due to the mismatch between the hole and electron pockets , the nesting condition is far from perfect and the nesting wavevector is usually incommensurate . in the presence of the ferro - orbital order",
    ", the distorted fermi surface enhances the nesting condition along one of the two directions with a commensurate nesting wavevector .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 ferro - orbital order favors the @xmath18 magnetic order while the @xmath19 order arises in the @xmath14 orbitally ordered state .",
    "this argument also gives a natural explanation why the structural phase transition always precedes the magnetic transition .",
    "very recently , avci _ et .",

    "we note that such re - entry of @xmath0 symmetry could still be consistent with an orbital model .",
    "let us denote @xmath73 as the stripe - like afm order with orbital order and @xmath74 as this new magnetic state with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "since @xmath73 and @xmath74 break different symmetries , a first order transition between them could naturally occur if they are competing orders .",
    "this is a general principle regardless the nature of the model . as a result , if a spin - nematic model could produce such a first order transition , so could an orbital model in principle .",
    "in fact , this again reflects that the mean - field phase diagram is insentitive to the details of the model as long as the symmetries of the phases are captured correctly .",
    "nevertheless , it is still intriguing to further explore the physical properties of this new magnetic state both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it is then clear that in order to resovle the microscopic mechanism driving the phase transitions in iron - based superconductors , the investigation on quantum fluctuations beyond the mean - field states is necessary .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the ferro - orbital order in a multiorbital system is in fact _ identical _ to the _ pomeranchuk instability _ in the @xmath2-wave channel.@xcite the elementary excitations in the proximity of the orbital ordering quantum critical point are unusual , leading to a non - fermi liquid behavior which can not be caused by the spin nematicity .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly review the principle behind the non - fermi liquid behavior emerging from the quantum criticality , which has been a hot research topic over the last decades . generally speaking",
    ", a phase transition can be described by a problem of minimization of the free energy @xmath75 , where @xmath49 is the internal energy of the system , @xmath7 the temperature , and @xmath76 is the entropy of the system . in classical systems ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations are dominant and hence , the phase transition is a compromise between states with lower @xmath49 and higher @xmath76 . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath77 is minimized by the state with higher entropy which has the most symmetries the system can have . on the other hand , at low temperature a state with lower internal energy",
    "is favored . in an interacting system ,",
    "such a state could have less symmetries . as a result ,",
    "a phase transition occurs when the system spontaneously loses some symmetries at a critical temperature @xmath78 as it is cooled down from high to low temperature .",
    "an indicator for the phase transition is an _ order parameter _ which develops a non - zero expectation value only in the low temperature ordered state .    in real systems",
    ", we can have a tuning parameter , namely @xmath79 , that we can use to change @xmath78 .",
    "typical examples for the tuning parameter are external pressure , magnetic field , and chemical dopings .",
    "a quantum phase transition@xcite is then referred to a transition occurring at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) defined at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "a surprising feature of this subject is that although the quantum phase transition is strictly at zero temperature , the associated quantum fluctuations near qcp can fundamentally change the physical properties even at finite temperature .",
    "this is why the field of quantum criticality has been so vibrant recently .",
    "along with its theoretical novelty , it is also very relevant to the strongly correlated materials .",
    "a recent review on new progress in several qcps of insulating phases can be found in ref .  .",
    "while the quantum fluctuations associated with the qcp can be described by the dynamics of the order parameters , the situation is further complicated in an itinerant system . in an insulating phase , by definition",
    ", all the quasiparticle spectrum is gapped , and as a consequence , the low energy physics contains only the collective excitations from the order parameter dynamics .",
    "if the qcp , however , resides in an itinerant system , the existence of the gapless quasiparticles can affect the dynamics of the order parameter and in feedback , the quasiparticle properties can also be altered fundamentally .",
    "the pioneering work in demonstrating this idea was done by hertz@xcite and later improved upon by millis@xcite .    consider a fermi liquid near a ferromagnetic qcp .",
    "since the ferromagnetic order is at zero momentum ( @xmath82 ) , we analyze the low energy excitations near @xmath82 .",
    "the particle - hole continuum from quasiparticles is bounded below @xmath83 \\sim \\vert \\vec{q}\\vert$ ] , where @xmath84 is the quasiparticle energy at momentum @xmath85 .",
    "given that the dispersion of the magnon in a ferromagnet goes like @xmath86 , as the ferromagnetic qcp is approached from the fermi liquid side , a branch of spin collective modes emerges with a dispersion of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 can be viewed as the mass of the magnon that vanishes at the qcp ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "clearly , right at the qcp the whole branch of the spin excitation modes lies completely inside the particle - hole continuum and hence , these collective modes can no longer have infinite life time and will eventually decay into uncorrelated particle - hole pairs . as shown by hertz and millis ,",
    "this _ overdamping _ effect brings in a correction to the _ dynamical exponent _ @xmath90 and can be captured even at the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) level .",
    "now we are ready to study the fate of the quasiparticles .",
    "since these overdamped spin modes near zero momentum still have non - zero spectral weights , quasiparticles can be scattered off them . as a result ,",
    "the life time of the quasiparticles , which is inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath91 , is no longer simply determined by the phase space argument as for a fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "rather , it is mostly determined by the dimension of the system as well as @xmath90 of the overdamped collective modes , @xmath92 , and in the current two - dimensional ferromagnetic qcp case , @xmath93 .",
    "this is the milestone result signaling the violation of the fermi liquid behavior ( @xmath94 ) induced by the quantum criticality .",
    "although the example given above is for a ferromagnetic qcp , the same theory can be applied to all the zero - momentum ordered states transitioned into from a fermi liquid since they fall into the same effective field theory in landau - ginzburg formalism .",
    "another example is the two - dimensional nematic quantum fluid first proposed by oganesyan _ et al._,@xcite which motivated a number of theoretical efforts.@xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbital ] , the nematic order is a translationally invariant phase breaking the rotational symmetry in which the fermi surface is spontaneously distorted along one particular direction in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "in fact , the instability toward the change of the fermi surface was studied a long time ago in 1958 .",
    "pomeranchuk@xcite first derived the criteria for the fermi surface instabilities induced by the interactions at higher angular momentum channels described by the landau parameters @xmath95 .",
    "the nematic order is one of these pomeranchuk instabilities which is in the @xmath2-wave interaction channel @xmath96 , and it has received a lot of attention in the last decade due to the discoveries of anisotropic phases in several systems.@xcite what was unexpected back at the time of pomeranchuk is that the nematic quantum fluid could exhibit a non - fermi liquid behavior in the same way as the itinerant ferromagnet , except that the interaction in this case would be from the charge instead of the spin .",
    "the reasoning is as follows .",
    "because the nematic order still preserves the translational invariance , it must be an order at zero momentum .",
    "moreover , since it breaks a continuous symmetry of rotation , it will develop goldstone modes with a dispersion of @xmath86 .",
    "finally , since the fermi surface is only distorted but not killed , there are still itinerant electrons and consequently the particle - hole continuum is still present . as a result ,",
    "all the physics discussed in the ferromagnetic qcp can be applied to the nematic qcp despite some differences in the details .",
    "indeed , the overdamped collective modes with @xmath97 as well as the non - fermi liquid behavior were found by oganesyan",
    "_ et al._@xcite using rpa theory , and later lawler _ et al .",
    "_ confirmed these findings using higher dimensional bosonization.@xcite we emphasize that the consistency between the results from rpa and higher dimensional bosonization is remarkable since the former is perturbative while the latter is non - perturbative .",
    "this suggests that rpa theory is asymptotically exact at long wavelength , and an analysis based on rpa theory for the quantum criticality near zero momentum is a reasonable starting point despite its perturbative nature .",
    "there is a concern that since the materials of interest are crystalline and do not have continuous rotational symmetry , the goldstone modes are not massless , which would be at odds with the occurrence of the non - fermi liquid .",
    "the main effect of this is that at zero temperature , in a lattice model the non - fermi liquid behavior goes away immediately in the nematic ordered phase , while in a continuous model it survives throughout the ordered phase .",
    "however , as long as the transition is of a second order , the critical fluctuations are still overdamped and massless at the qcp in a lattice model , and the non - fermi liquid behavior still prevails . at finite temperature , if the thermal fluctuations are large enough , i.e. , @xmath98 where @xmath22 is the mass of the goldstone mode , the non - fermi liquid behavior still emerges .",
    "the non - fermi liquid behavior near the nematic qcp at zero and finite temperature in a lattice model has been studied.@xcite      as discussed in the previous sub - section , the finger print of the non - fermi liquid behavior is the collective mode arising from critical fluctuations near the qcp with a dynamical exponent of @xmath97 .",
    "this is commonly the case for a zero - momentum ordered state . in this section",
    ", we will review the study on a two - orbital model which is the minimal model for the iron pnictides and bilayer sr@xmath99ru@xmath72o@xmath100 .",
    "the key point here is that the orbital order in a two - orbital model is _ identical _ to the nematic order in a single - band lattice model .",
    "hence they share the same physics , including the non - fermi liquid behavior near the qcp .    to see this connection , we start from the fermiology of the two - orbital model discussed in sec .",
    "2 . within the framework of the fermi liquid theory ,",
    "the interactions that are relevant should be the ones between states on the fermi surface . without a loss of generality , the eigenstate wavefunction on the @xmath101 fermi surface",
    "can be generally written as:@xcite | _ , ( p)= ( _ p |d_xz(p)+_p |d_yz(p ) ) _ where @xmath102 is the hybridization angle between @xmath103 and @xmath104 at @xmath105 and @xmath106 is spin eigenstate . in real space , the @xmath0 symmetry is enforced by the interchange of @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals up to a sign under a @xmath107 rotation , @xmath108 .",
    "this places a relation between the eigenstate wavefunctions at @xmath105 and @xmath109 of @xmath110 .",
    "following the standard procedure , we evaluate the interaction @xmath111 between states at @xmath112 and @xmath113 on the fermi surface as _ , ( p_1 ) , _ , ( p_2)| v(p_1,p_2 ) | _ , ( p_2 ) , _ , ( p_1 ) .",

    "clearly , the hartree term is not affected by the multiorbital nature , but the effect of the orbital hybridization comes in the fock exchange part , leading to the effective landau interaction function , f^s(p_1,p_2)&= & v(q=0 ) -[1 + 2 ( _ p_1-_p_2 ) ] v(p_1,p_2 ) , + f^a(p_1 , p_2)&= & -[1 + 2 ( _ p_1-_p_2 ) ] v(p_1,p_2 ) .",
    "now it becomes apparent that because of the form factor @xmath114 , the orbital hybridization induces a @xmath2-wave landau interaction _ regardless the original form of _ @xmath111 .",
    "in other words , the tendency toward the nematic order , or equivalently an orbital order , is naturally enhanced in such a two - orbital system .    applying the same procedure outlined above",
    ", one can readily show that the two - orbital model can be mapped to a two - band model with a large @xmath96 interaction on its fermi surfaces .",
    "such a mapping has to be true because orbital degrees of freedom are only well - defined on a lattice . as a result",
    ", it will eventually evolve into a band model when approaching the continuum limit . since there is no phase transition induced simply by taking the continuum limit",
    ", the orbital model has the same physics as its corresponding band model .",
    "this indicates that the orbital order in a weak - coupling itinerant system is _ identical _ to the nematic order from the @xmath2-wave pomeranchuk instability .",
    "this is different from the strong coupling limit in which the orbital order is an ising - like order as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : strong ] .",
    "this should not be surprising since quite generally the hybridizations between different orbitals are in the single particle part of the hamiltonian , not in the interaction part .",
    "as a result , the orbital index is not a good ` quantum number ' in the weak coupling limit but remains approximately a good one in the strong coupling limit .",
    "there have been several studies on the two - orbital model beyond the mean - field theory .",
    "a renormalization group analysis showed that the orbital order instability can be largely enhanced by spin fluctuations , which has been exploited to explain the magnetic field - induced nematicity observed in sr@xmath99ru@xmath72o@xmath100.@xcite lo _",
    "et al._@xcite have analyzed the two - orbital model using higher dimensional bosonization .",
    "near the orbital ordering qcp , it is found that a branch of overdamped collective modes with @xmath97 does emerge .",
    "this provides a strong foundation for the occurrence of the non - fermi liquid behavior in the iron pnictides which will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "iron pnictides are known for their complicated multiorbital structure .",
    "it has been suggested that in the unfolded brillouin zone , a model containing five orbitals is a much better choice to capture the details in the electronic structure.@xcite although the orbital order involves mostly the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals , the couplings to other orbitals can substantially modify the hybridization between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . therefore a theory based on a five - orbital model capturing enough detail is certainly necessary to demonstrate the non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "fortunately , since the rpa theory is a reliable starting point as explained in sec .  3.1 , one can directly calculate the single particle self energy@xcite at the rpa level with a multiorbital hubbard model.@xcite    the computational scheme for the self energy @xmath115 can be depicted by the feynman diagram plotted in fig .  [ fig : feynman ] , and we refer the readers to ref .   for details .",
    "it is shown@xcite that @xmath116 changes from a fermi liquid ( @xmath117 ) to a non - fermi liquid ( @xmath118 ) behavior as the orbital ordering quantum critical point is approached within a realistic range of interaction parameters for the multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "this further confirms that the important physics from the two - orbital model survives in a complicated five - orbital model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expt ] , we will discuss that such a non - fermi liquid behavior gives a natural explanation to the novel enhancement of the zero bias conductance observed in a recent point contact measurement.@xcite     feynman diagrams for the single particle self energy at the rpa level .",

    "the greek symbols are internal indices which are summed over all orbitals and spins . ]",
    "it should be noted that in this five - orbital hubbard model , contributions to the single particle self energy from the spin interaction are actually not small . as a result , it is an open debate as to whether the orbital ordering is caused from charge or spin interactions , and with the current model , there seems to be no hope in resolving this issue .",
    "nevertheless , if one includes the nearest - neighbor interaction , the contributions from charge interaction can be enhanced .",
    "this is demonstrated@xcite within the context of sr@xmath99ru@xmath72o@xmath100 which is another intriguing material exhibiting the anisotropic phase under magnetic field .",

    "_ showed that including the electron - phonon coupling as well as the vertex corrections beyond the rpa level can boost up the orbital order instabilities in the charge channel which may lead to an even richer phase diagram.@xcite .",
    "since these new additions to the multiorbital hubbard model are all realistic and not negligible in general , the orbital ordering from charge interaction should be more important than it now appears , at least for some families of the iron pnictides .",

    "for example , a recent raman measurement has shown a superconductivity - induced peak in the b@xmath168 channel in ba@xmath169k@xmath170fe@xmath72as@xmath72 , which was originally interpreted as the existence of a competing @xmath2-wave superconducting component.@xcite one of us , however , showed that the orbital fluctuations in the superconducting state could lead to such a peak as well.@xcite nevertheless , it appears to be surprising that superconductivity is ubiquitous among the iron pnictides despite this non - universality . if it turns out that superconductivity does arise from a normal state with strong orbital fluctuations in some families of the iron based superconductors , a unified picture for the pairing mechanism will never be complete without the orbital physics taken into account .",
