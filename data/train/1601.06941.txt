    "motion of interphase boundaries in a random environment remains an open problem of general interest .",
    "much attention has been paid to the depinning transition in the systems where collective pinning creates non - trivial critical behaviour of the interface separating two different phases : fluid invasion in porous media , magnetic domain wall motion , flux vortex motion in type ii superconductors , charge density wave conduction , dynamics of cracks , solid friction @xcite .",
    "the theory of the depinning transition is based on the analysis of the following equation for the interface position @xmath0 : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the externally imposed force , @xmath3 is the noise due to the randomness of the media , @xmath4 is time , and @xmath5 $ ] is some operator .",
    "when @xmath2 is close to the depinning threshold @xmath6 ( where the interface begins to move ) , this approach generally results in the power law for the average interface velocity @xmath7 @xmath8 where the exponent @xmath9 is universal .",
    "the origin of this dependence lies in the peculiar interface dynamics near the pinning threshold namely a random succession of avalanches of depinning events .",
    "when @xmath10 , a conventional mobility law @xmath11 becomes valid .",
    "depinning of the triple gas - liquid - solid contact line on a solid surface with defects is another example of the depinning transition .",
    "the outlined above general approach to the interface depinning phenomena is frequently applied to the contact line depinning @xcite .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the theory and the experimental data on contact line motion is notable .",
    "first , @xmath12 according to the theoretical studies ( see @xcite ) , while @xmath13 was found experimentally @xcite .",
    "second , the linear regime ( [ vf ] ) was never obtained @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a framework suitable to explain these results .",
    "the major problem in this field is related to the failure of the conventional hydrodynamic approach based on the `` no - slip '' boundary condition ( zero liquid velocity ) at the solid surface in the vicinity of the contact line .",
    "such an approach @xcite would result in a mathematical singularity at the contact line : the diverging viscous dissipation .",
    "in reality the dissipation in the vicinity of the contact line is large but finite @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the singularity removal for the partial wetting case is still under debate .",
    "multiple singularity removal mechanisms were proposed @xcite .",
    "most of these models ( those which are not limited to the small values of the dynamic contact angle @xmath14 ) result in the following expression for the contact line velocity @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equilibrium ( young ) value of the contact angle , @xmath18 is the surface tension , and @xmath19 is a mechanism - dependent coefficient that has the same dimension as the shear viscosity @xmath20 .",
    "since the contact line is not straight due to the presence of the defects , the theoretical analysis of pinning requires the 3d modelling .",
    "such a modelling can be extremely difficult when using the hydrodynamic contact line motion models where the flow pattern depends on the contact line curvature .",
    "recent papers @xcite have introduced a simpler approach .",
    "it is valid if the most dissipation that occurs in the fluid with the moving contact line takes place in the near contact line region .",
    "the latter is defined as a fluid `` thread '' adjacent to the contact line .",
    "its diameter is assumed to be much smaller than the radius of curvature of the fluid surface . in other words , the viscous dissipation in the bulk of the fluid",
    "is neglected with respect to the dissipation that occurs close to the contact line .",
    "this assumption is verified by numerous experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a single constant dissipation coefficient @xmath19 is introduced to account for the anomalous dissipation in the vicinity of the contact line without detailing its origin . by further assuming that this dissipation is the same both for advancing and receding contact line motion , the energy dissipation rate can be written in the lowest order in @xmath15 as @xcite @xmath21 where the integration is performed along the contact line .",
    "the equation for the contact line motion can be obtained from the force balance between the induced and friction forces @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 means functional derivative , dot means the time derivative , and @xmath0 defines the contact line position .",
    "the potential energy @xmath24 of the system needs to be calculated assuming that each time moment the fluid surface takes its equilibrium shape .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that such a quasistatic scheme leads to eq .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) for an arbitrary contact line geometry . the dynamic approach ( where the fluid surface shape is determined from hydrodynamics ) is considered elsewhere @xcite .",

    "( [ cos1 ] ) .",
    "the quasistatic approach is of course not new .",
    "it was applied by many researchers , in particular by golestanian and raphal in the approximation of the small contact angles @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our approach is the account of the gravity or / and fluid volume conservation which allow to obtain the contact line shapes rigourously . in particular , for the wilhelmy geometry considered below , we take into account the gravity influence which permits @xcite to avoid divergences @xcite and thus obtain the contact line profile . when the gravity is irrelevant ( as for small drops )",
    ", the fluid volume conservation plays this stabilising role @xcite .",

    "when the gravity influence tends to zero , @xmath49 increases and the gravity induced ( second derivative ) term that describes the contact line deformation becomes dominating . in other words , the gravity influence on the contact line deformation is important even in the large capillary length limit .",

    "it was demonstrated in this paper that the descriptions of the depinning of interface separating two phases ( e.g. for fluid invasion of porous media ) and of the triple contact line , while similar in many respects , has essential differences .",
    "the main of them is related to the external force that can be controlled directly for the case of interface depinning and enters its equation of motion as an additive term .",
