    "after the theoretical prediction of topological insulators , and their subsequent experimental realization , the field of topological condensed matter has grown manifold  @xcite . the topological order manifested in these systems is not associated with spontaneous breaking of a symmetry , but rather can be described by a topological invariant which is insensitive to a smooth deformation of the hamiltonian . usually the robust topological protection is associated with a non - zero spectral gap in the bulk of the system , and the presence of protected zero energy surface states is regarded as the hallmark of a non - trivial topological phase of matter . however , recently it has been proposed that systems in three spatial dimensions , in the presence of broken time - reversal ( tr ) and/or space - inversion ( si ) symmetry , can also be topologically protected even without a bulk energy gap  @xcite",
    ". these are weyl semimetals ( wsm ) - the nomenclature based on the dirac / weyl equation which is used to describe their low energy excitations  @xcite .",
    "a number of recent experiments have claimed to be able to observe the weyl semimetal phase in an inversion asymmetric compound taas  @xcite , and also in a 3d double gyroid photonic crystal  @xcite , without breaking tr .",
    "another route which can result in the experimental verification of the novel wsm phase is to first realize a 3d dirac semimetal and then break time reversal symmetry by applying a magnetic field , which will split a dirac cone into a pair of weyl nodes . na@xmath2bi and",

    "a simple wsm with broken time reversal symmetry can be desribed by a pair of linearly dispersing massless dirac fermions governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the vector of pauli spin matrices defined in the space of two non - degenerate energy bands , @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath10 are the two band touching points separated from each other in momentum space by @xmath11 .",
    "it is essential that @xmath12 is non - zero to ensure that the system breaks tr and is topologically non - trivial , in which case @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe two weyl fermions of opposite chirality . the two band touching weyl points act as a source and a sink ( monopole and anti - monopole ) of berry curvature , which acts as a fictitious magnetic field on the electron wave - function in momentum space  @xcite . for @xmath15 ,",

    "since the tr - broken wsm has a non - zero anomalous hall response ( i.e. , non - zero hall efffect induced by the berry curvature even in the absence of a magnetic field ) it is expected that the anomalous nernst response will also be non - zero .",

    "in the main part of the paper , we use the semi - classical boltzmann equations in the relaxation time approximation in the presence of a non - zero magnetic field and a berry curvature , and derive the thermoelectric and charge conductivity tensors ( both longitudinal and hall ) which we use to calculate both the conventional ( i.e. , magnetic field dependent ) and topological ( i.e. zero field ) nernst coefficients .",

    "i.e. the temperature gradient @xmath24 applied perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath25 , we find that the transverse magneto - thermal conductivity obeys the wiedemann - franz law  @xcite ( i.e. , the ratio of the thermal and electrical conductivity is the lorenz number @xmath26 , both with and without the external magnetic field ) . in the parallel setup ( @xmath1 )",
    ", however , there is an additional @xmath27 dependence of the lorenz number , thus violating the standard wiedemann - franz law for quasiparticles in a landau fermi liquid , arising from the chiral anomaly .",
    "our results confirm that the violation of the wiedemann - franz law between the longitudinal magneto thermal and electrical conductivities  @xcite persist in the physically more transparent lattice model and is not an artifact of the linearized low energy model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the boltzmann semi - classical approach to calculate the nernst response in a weyl semimetal .",
    "we derive expressions for both longitudinal and transverse charge ( @xmath28 ) and peltier ( @xmath29 ) conductivity tensors , taking into account perturbative electric and magnetic fields , and a finite temperature gradient , for a hamiltonian with a non - vanishing berry curvature .",
    "though the approach is general and can be applied for various configurations , we will compute our expressions relevant for the nernst experimental setup .",
    "section iii concerns with the nernst response in a linearly dispersing model of dirac and weyl fermions .",
    "we compute the magnetic field dependent nernst response for a single dirac node , and also for a pair of weyl nodes which have a non - vanishing flux of the berry curvature .",
    "additionally weyl fermions also exhibit an anomalous nernst response even at zero magnetic field when one imposes a physical ultraviolet cut - off on the energy spectrum , and we show that this imposition gives a non - zero peltier coefficient @xmath20 . section iv concerns with the lattice wsm model and its nernst response . in section",

    "<S> weyl semimetals ( wsm ) are topologically protected three dimensional materials whose low energy excitations are linearly dispersing massless dirac fermions , possessing a non - trivial berry curvature . using semi - classical boltzmann dynamics in the relaxation time approximation for a lattice model of time reversal ( tr ) symmetry broken wsm , we compute both magnetic field dependent and anomalous contributions to the nernst coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the magnetic field dependent nernst response , which is present in both dirac and weyl semimetals , we show that , contrary to previous reports , the tr - broken wsm also has an anomalous nernst response due to a non - vanishing berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the thermal conductivities of a wsm in the nernst ( @xmath0 ) and the longitudinal ( @xmath1 ) set - up and confirm from our lattice model that in the parallel set - up , the wiedemann - franz law is violated between the longitudinal thermal and electrical conductivities due to chiral anomaly . </S>"
