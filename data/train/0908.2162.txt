    "in a supernova ( sn ) explosion , an outward shockwave formed in an inner layer propagates through the stellar envelope .",
    "when the shock emerges from the stellar surface , a hot fire ball suddenly appears and flashes in soft x - ray or ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "the flash has a quasi - blackbody spectrum ( @xmath7  k ) and lasts a few seconds to @xmath8  days , depending on an ejecta mass @xmath9 , explosion energy @xmath10 , and presupernova radius @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon is called `` shock breakout '' having been theoretically predicted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the short duration and x - ray / uv - peaked spectra , it is difficult to observe directly the shock breakout .",
    "the first detection of shock breakout was reported for nearby type ii - peculiar sn  1987a @xcite , but it was only a detection of a rapid decline presumed to be a shock breakout tail . although the detections of shock breakout tails were occasionally reported for type iib sn  1993j @xcite and type ib sn  1999ex @xcite , there were no observations of shock breakouts from the rising part or with the x - ray or uv light .",
    "first entire observations of the shock breakouts were reported in 2008 .",
    "a first example is an x - ray observation of type ib sn  2008d which fortunately appeared in the same galaxy as sn  2007uy during the observation by the _ swift _ satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "second examples are type ii plateau sne ( sne iip ) snls-04d2dc(@xmath12 , @xcite ) and snls-06d1jd ( @xmath13 , @xcite ) .",
    "they were caught coincidentally in the uv deep imaging survey by the _ galex _ satellite @xcite at the location where supernova legacy survey ( snls , @xcite ) found sn candidates .",
    "since sne iip are the most common among core - collapse types of sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) and their shock breakouts are suggested to be so bright as to be detected even at @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is important to develop a way to derive sn properties from the shock breakouts .",
    "therefore , we calculate multicolor light curves ( lcs ) , including a shock breakout and plateau , of sn iip based on an evolutionary progenitor model with a multigroup radiation hydrodynamics code stella @xcite .",
    "the synthetic lcs are compared with the multicolor observations of sn iip snls-04d2dc  ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 [ j2000.0 ] ) .",
    "we first present a multicolor lc model reproducing well the shock breakout and plateau consistently and constrain sn and progenitor properties .",
    "furthermore , based on the multicolor lc model , we present an apparent @xmath3-band light curve of a shock breakout of a sn being identical to snls-04d2dc  at @xmath5 .    in   [ sec : model ] , the applied models and the radiation hydrodynamics calculations are described . in   [",
    "sec : result ] , the multicolor lcs of snls-04d2dc  are compared with the synthetic lcs . in   [ sec : discuss ] , conclusion and discussion are presented .",
    "we apply the multigroup spherical radiation hydrodynamics code stella @xcite .",
    "stella adopts variable eddington factors , a gray transfer of @xmath16-ray from radioactive nuclei , lte ionization states , and a multigroup expansion opacity and solves the time - dependent equations implicitly for the angular moments of intensity averaged over fixed frequency bands ( for details , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "multigroup radiative transfer is coupled with hydrodynamics , which enables to acquire the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) self - consistently .",
    "the color temperature of a sn is estimated from a black - body fitting of the sed . in this letter",
    "we adopt 100 frequency bins dividing logarithmically from @xmath17     to @xmath18   ; the large number of frequency bins allows to describe accurately a non - equilibrium continuum radiation .",
    "a progenitor model is a non - rotating solar - metallicity star constructed by a stellar evolution calculation @xcite .",
    "the calculation includes a metallicity - dependent mass loss @xcite and thus the presupernova model has a self - consistent @xmath11 , luminosity , temperature , envelope mass , and total mass .",
    "since the shock breakout and plateau depend on @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our calculation achieves self - consistent multicolor lcs from the shock breakout to plateau and tail . in this letter",
    "we present a sn explosion of a star with a zero - age main - sequence mass @xmath19 having a presupernova mass @xmath20 , h envelope mass @xmath21 , and presupernova radius @xmath22 . an extensive investigation will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found a uv brightening at the snls-04d2dcposition which lasts several days from @xmath23 days before the first snls observation .",
    "although the optical observation of the shock breakout is not available , the uv - optical lcs of the shock breakout and plateau can be compared with the synthetic multicolor lcs .",
    "we assume the date of shock breakout to be 2453062.2 jd ( @xmath24 ) and compare the model and observations with reference to the date . in this letter",
    "the epochs are described in the observer frame .",
    "the multigroup spherical radiation hydrodynamics calculation provides wavelength- and time - dependent fluxes at the sn surface .",
    "when a sn is observed from a given direction , lights from different parts of the sn surface are radiated at different time and at different radii ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we take into account a light travel time correction and limb darkening in the eddington approximation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows corrected wavelength - dependent luminosities @xmath25 for a sn iip model with @xmath19 and @xmath26  ergs .",
    "the sed at @xmath27  days is compared with synthetic non - lte spectrum ( @xmath28  hr , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) which gives similar optical color .",
    "although the epochs are different because of adopting different progenitor models , the uv sed and spectrum derived from the independent calculations are distinctly consistent .",
    "the consistency justifies both theoretical calculations .    in order to predict multicolor observations from the multicolor theoretical model ,",
    "the model lights are diluted , redshifted , reddened , and then convolved with the sensitivities of the satellite and telescope ( _ galex _ : @xcite , the megaprime / megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) for snls : @xcite ) . for illustration purpose ,",
    "the sensitivity curves blueshifted to the rest frame to compensate for @xmath12 are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : sed ] . in this letter",
    "the bands are described in the observer frame .",
    "the uv light allows for direct observations of the shock breakout but is strongly reduced by extinction .",
    "thus it is crucial to estimate correctly the extinction in the host galaxy and our galaxy . while the color excess of our galaxy @xmath29 is taken from schlegel et  al .",
    "( 1998 , @xmath30  mag ) , it is difficult to estimate the color excess and thus extinction of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite estimates the color excess of the host galaxy @xmath31 at the sn location from the balmer decrement as @xmath32  mag .",
    "however , they caution that the uncertainty of the total extinction is as much as a factor of two and further note that the estimate from the empirical relation of sne iip @xcite is consistent with both of @xmath32  mag and @xmath33 .",
    "assuming the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) reddening law for the host galaxy @xcite and @xmath32  mag , the total extinction at the effective wavelengths of the far and near uv ( fuv and nuv ) filters of the _ galex _ satellite are as large as @xmath34  mag and @xmath35  mag , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we call these values `` standard '' extinction .",
    "although the values are slightly different from @xcite , the total extinction integrated over each band depends on the intrinsic spectrum and varies with time as the spectrum changes .",
    "the variations of extinction in the uv bands are relatively large ; for example , @xmath36  mag in the fuv band and @xmath37  mag in the nuv band from @xmath24 to 20 days for the sn iip model with @xmath19 and @xmath26  ergs .",
    "because of the large uncertainty , we assume several values for the color excess of the host galaxy as follows : @xmath38  mag referring to the case of no extinction in the host galaxy , @xmath39  mag giving half of the standard extinction in the nuv band , @xmath32  mag being the standard extinction , and @xmath40  mag giving double of the standard extinction in the nuv band , which lead to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively . here",
    ", we assume the smc reddening law for the host galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : snlsuv ] shows comparisons of uv lcs with the model with @xmath19 and @xmath26  ergs .",
    "the model lcs are consistent with the observations within the uncertainty , while they are slightly fainter than the observations for @xmath32  mag .",
    "the explosion energy of snls-04d2dc is consistent with the canonical value of the explosion energies of core - collapse sne [ e.g. , sn  1987a : @xmath45  ergs , @xcite ] .",
    "although the @xmath46ni-@xmath46co  radioactive decay does not contribute to the shock breakout , we expediently assume a canonical @xmath46ni  ejection without mixing to the envelope [ the ejected @xmath46ni  mass @xmath47 , e.g. , sn  1987a : @xcite ] , and thus @xmath48 to yield @xmath49 of @xmath46ni .",
    "the second peak in the nuv lc at @xmath50  days is reproduced by the model and explained by the shift of the peak wavelength as @xcite and @xcite suggested .",
    "the bolometric lc and the evolution of color temperature are shown in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] also shows the velocity evolution of photosphere defined as a position where the radiation and gas are decoupled .",
    "although the bolometric luminosity declines monotonically after the shock breakout , the radiation energy in the nuv band increases with time because the peak wavelength shifts long ( fig .  [ fig : sed ] ) . after the nuv second peak , the color temperature decreases further and the peak wavelength shifts to the optical bands .",
    "the shift is caused by not only the decreasing temperature of the sn ejecta but also an enhancement of the metal absorption lines due to the low temperature . as a result ,",
    "the uv luminosity declines monotonically after the nuv second peak .",
    "the model also predicts a second peak in the fuv band but the brightening is obscured because of the low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thanks to the multigroup radiation hydrodynamics calculations , subsequent evolutions of multicolor lights are obtained and compared with the snls optical observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : snlsopt ] shows comparisons of the @xmath51- , @xmath52- , @xmath53- , and @xmath54-band lcs .",
    "here , we adopt @xmath32  mag and the smc reddening law for the host galaxy . the total extinction at the effective wavelengths of the @xmath51- , @xmath52- , @xmath53- , and @xmath54-band filters of the megaprime / megacam on cfht are as large as @xmath55  mag , @xmath56  mag , @xmath57  mag , and @xmath58  mag , respectively .    as sed peaks in the @xmath51-band at @xmath59  days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , the @xmath51-band lc peaks at @xmath59  days . after this epoch",
    ", the sed becomes red with time and the blue edge of the sed enters in the @xmath51-band .",
    "thus , the @xmath51-band lc declines more rapidly than the other optical - band lcs . on the other hand , the @xmath52-band lc declines gradually and the decline rate slightly changes at @xmath60  days when the sed peak enters in the @xmath52-band .",
    "the @xmath53- and @xmath54-band lcs brighten by @xmath61  days due to the shift of the peak wavelength .",
    "although the overall multicolor lcs are well reproduced by the model , the @xmath54-band model lc is brighter than the observation at @xmath62  days .",
    "the discrepancy would be improved if we add more physics to stella .",
    "stella currently has around @xmath63 spectral lines from @xcite and @xcite and a rather poor line list in near infrared , while tens of millions of spectral lines from large kurucz lists are being included ( e. sorokina , private communication ) .",
    "the expansion of line lists , together with taking into account non - equilibrium effects in an important coolant like , may influence the @xmath54-band flux appreciably @xcite .",
    "no mixing of @xmath46ni  leads to no contribution from the radioactive heating to the lc at @xmath64  days , while the radioactive decay could power the lc from the early phases if @xmath46ni  is mixed to the envelope .",
    "because of the lack of observations at @xmath65  days , @xmath66 of snls-04d2dc  can not be constrained .",
    "we note that the available observations can be reproduced equally well even if no @xmath46ni  is ejected .",
    "we present a multicolor lc model with the multigroup radiation hydrodynamical code stella .",
    "the model reproduces the multicolor uv - optical lcs of the shock breakout and plateau of snls-04d2dcconsistently .",
    "since the shock breakout is more sensitive to @xmath10 and @xmath11 than the plateau @xcite , the sn and progenitor properties are constrained more tightly than only with the plateau observation .",
    "we clarify the properties of snls-04d2dc : the progenitor is a star with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 , and the sn has the canonical explosion energy @xmath26  ergs . because of no observations at @xmath65  days , we can not constrain @xmath66 of snls-04d2dc , while we expediently adopt @xmath48 and @xmath47 .    the second peak of the nuv lc",
    "is reproduced by the shift of the peak wavelength , in spite of the monotonic decline of the bolometric lc .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of the fuv lc is quite low , the model is also in an agreement with the fuv lc .",
    "the consistency supports the origin of the nuv second peak .",
    "when only the monotonic light curve is obtained , only two observational quantities , i.e. , flux and duration , are available and the three properties characterizing the shock breakout , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 , are degenerated .",
    "the multicolor observation enables us to constrain the color temperature and thus to resolve the degeneracy . in order to clarify the sn properties in detail ,",
    "it is required to employ the multigroup radiation hydrodynamical calculations because the spectra of the shock breakout slightly deviate from the blackbody .    the successful reproduction of uv - optical lcs of snls-04d2dc and the consistency with the non - lte spectral calculation justify the multigroup radiation hydrodynamics calculation with stella and",
    "indicate that the calculations are capable of predicting the multicolor observations of the shock breakout and plateau of sne iip .",
    "if a sn being identical to snls-04d2dc  takes place at @xmath5 in the direction with @xmath30  mag , the sn brightness will be @xmath4  mag without the host galaxy extinction or @xmath67  mag with the host galaxy extinction with @xmath32  mag and the smc reddening law ( fig .  [",
    "fig : z1 ] ) .",
    "it is bright enough to be detected with 8m - class telescopes .",
    "the result envisages that future deep and wide surveys by , e.g. , skymapper , panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and subaru / hyper suprime - camera ( hsc ) , will find a large number of shock breakouts .",
    "the large sample will import totally - new knowledge about cosmic evolution histories , e.g. , a core - collapse sn rate and a star formation rate , at @xmath6 . therefore , although the detections of type iin sne at @xmath68 are recently reported @xcite , we still emphasize a great potential of shock breakouts for direct detection of the most common core - collapse sne , sne iip , at @xmath6 .    finally , we point out that the estimate of the host galaxy extinction is crucial to estimate the intrinsic luminosity of shock breakout .",
    "this is because the shock breakout of sn iip emits the radiation energy mainly in uv easily reduced by the interstellar extinction . with the use of the sensitiveness ,",
    "if the observations of shock breakout , plateau , and tail are available with high signal - to - noise ratios , finding a set of a sn model and extinction , which consistently reproduces the observations , might provide a new constraint on the host galaxy extinction .",
