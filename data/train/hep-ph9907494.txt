    "[ sec : intro ]    loop integrals play an important role in making precise perturbative predictions in quantum field theory , in general , and in the standard model of particle physics , in particular . as such ,",
    "a large effort has been expended in developing methods for evaluating them .",
    "the problem is complicated by the appearance of ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities , and it has become customary to use dimensional regularisation  @xcite to extend the dimensionality of the loop integral away from 4-dimensions to @xmath5 , to regulate the infrared and ultraviolet singularities .    with the increasing of the number of legs , of the number of mass scales or of the number of loops , the integrals can be made almost arbitrarily complex and difficult to solve analytically .",
    "different methods  @xcite@xcite have been developed to solve the feynman integrals .",
    "we mention here only two of them : the integration by parts  @xcite , which works well for some two - loop vertex diagrams  @xcite reducing them to simpler known graphs with different powers of the propagators ( however this breaks down for more complicated graphs such as the double box , where irreducible numerators factors are present ) and the mellin - barnes integral representation ( see for example  @xcite ) , which was successfully used by smirnov  @xcite to calculate the two - loop box integral . in this approach , the integral is usually written as multiple contour integrals of @xmath6 functions and powers of ratios of the mass scales in the problem . by closing the contour",
    ", we obtain an infinite series of residues at the singular points of the @xmath6 functions .",
    "these series can be identified as generalised hypergeometric functions , whose convergence properties reflect the threshold - singularity structure of the integral .    there are several advantages in using hypergeometric functions to represent the integral .",
    "first , these hypergeometric functions often have integral representations themselves , in which an expansion in @xmath7 can be made , yielding expressions in logarithms , dilogarithms etc .. it seems that , where direct evaluation of the hypergeometric function in terms of known functions is possible , very compact results are obtained  @xcite .",
    "second , because the series is convergent and well behaved in a particular region of phase space , it can be numerically evaluated  @xcite .",
    "in fact , each hypergeometric representation immediately allows an asymptotic expansion of the integral in terms of ratios of momentum and mass scales .",
    "third , through analytic continuation formulae , the hypergeometric functions valid in one kinematic domain can be re - expressed in a different kinematic region .",
    "not all work has concentrated around @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , a close connection between tensor loop integrals - those with additional powers of the loop momentum in the numerator - and higher - dimension scalar integrals ( @xmath9 , for example ) is well established  @xcite . furthermore , in 1987 , halliday and ricotta  @xcite suggested that it would be useful to calculate the loop integral considering @xmath1 as a negative number . because loop integrals are analytic in the number of dimensions @xmath1 ( and also in the powers of the propagators )",
    "they proposed to calculate the integral in negative dimensions and return to positive dimensions , and specifically @xmath5 , after the integrations have been performed . as we will discuss more fully later on , integration over the loop momentum and/or the parameters introduced to do the loop integration is replaced with infinite series , which again can be identified as generalised hypergeometric functions .",
    "recently this idea has been picked up again by suzuki and schmidt who have evaluated a number of two - loop integrals  @xcite , three - loop integrals  @xcite , one - loop tensor integrals  @xcite as well as the one - loop massive box integral for the scattering of light by light  @xcite . in this latter case , as well as reproducing the known hypergeometric - series representations of ref .",
    "@xcite , valid in particular kinematic regions , suzuki and schmidt simultaneously found hypergeometric solutions valid in other kinematic domains .",
    "of course , all of these solutions are related by analytic continuation .",
    "however , it is easy to envisage integrals that yield hypergeometric functions where the analytic continuation formulae are not known a priori . in these cases , having series expansions directly available in all kinematic regions is useful .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore the negative - dimension approach ( ndim ) further .",
    "in particular we focus on one - loop integrals with general powers of the propagators and arbitrary dimension @xmath1 .",
    "there are several reasons for doing this .",
    "first , it allows connection with the general tensor - reduction program based on integration by parts of refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the tensor integrals are linear combinations of scalar integrals with either higher dimension or propagators raised to higher powers .",
    "second , we can imagine inserting the one - loop results into a two - loop integral by closing up external legs .",
    "this is trivial for most bubble integrals , but more complicated for vertex and box graphs .",
    "broadhurst  @xcite has shown that this is possible for the non - trivial two - loop self - energy graph .",
    "third , it actually simplifies the calculation .",
    "as we will show , by keeping the parameters general , it is easier to identify the regions of convergence of the hypergeometric series and therefore which hypergeometric functions to group together . for specific values of the parameters ,",
    "the hypergeometric functions often collapse to simpler functions . as a first step ,",
    "we develop the general framework and apply it to massive bubble and vertex integrals . of course many of these results are well known",
    ". however , they serve to iron out some of the subtleties of the ndim approach . to give a concrete new result , we present expressions for the vertex integral with one off - shell leg and two internal masses in arbitrary dimension and for general powers of the propagators in terms of hypergeometric functions of two variables .",
    "the kinematic singularity structure of this graph is sufficiently complex to give insight into how ndim operates and gives some hope that more complicated graphs can also be evaluated .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we first review the theoretical framework of one - loop integrals with schwinger parameters and briefly explain the basic idea of integrating in negative dimensions .",
    "we then apply ndim to construct template solutions for arbitrary one - loop integrals together with a linear system of constraints that relates the powers of the propagators in the loop integral to the summation variables .",
    "the system of constraints has many solutions and each one must be inserted into the template solution , yielding a sum over fewer variables that can be identified as a generalised hypergeometric function .",
    "this method gives simultaneously all the solutions in all the possible kinematic regions .",
    "the approach is illustrated for the massive bubble integral where we show how to recover the known results .",
    "we discuss how the form of the solution in different kinematical regimes is dictated by the convergence properties of the hypergeometric functions and the structure of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangles ] we consider one - loop triangles and give the form of the template solution and the system of constraints with arbitrary powers of the propagators , internal masses , external legs off - shell and for general @xmath1 .",
    "we apply this result to triangle integrals with three scales and give expressions valid in the various kinematic regions appropriate to the vertex integral .",
    "results are given in the form of hypergeometric functions of one and two variables , which are defined in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "for specific choices of @xmath1 and the propagator powers , these functions can be evaluated as logarithms and dilogarithms using the integral representations that are also provided in the appendix together with a list of hypergeometric identities that often simplify the results .",
    "finally , our method is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the generic @xmath0-point one - loop integral in @xmath1-dimensional minkowski space with loop momentum @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic ] , the external momenta @xmath12 are all incoming so that @xmath13 and the propagators have the form @xmath14 @xmath15 being the mass of the @xmath16th propagator .",
    "the external momentum scales are indicated with @xmath17 . for standard integrals , the powers @xmath18 to which each propagator is raised are usually unity .",
    "however , we wish , where possible , to leave the powers as general as possible . as discussed earlier",
    ", this may have some advantages in evaluating two - loop integrals where often one - loop integrals with arbitrary powers can be inserted into the second loop integration .      to evaluate this integral",
    ", we introduce a schwinger parameter @xmath19 for each propagator ( noting that @xmath20 after wick rotation to euclidean space ) so that @xmath21 and we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : idloop ] ) as @xmath22 where we have used the shorthand @xmath23 with @xmath24 the gaussian integral over the loop momentum can be solved in a straightforward way , and using the minkowski space relation @xmath25 we have the usual minkowski space result @xmath26 the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 while @xmath30 may be simply read off from the feynman diagram @xmath31 each of the @xmath3 terms in @xmath30 is indicated with @xmath32 , and is obtained by cutting the loop diagram into two across propagators @xmath33 and @xmath34 and constructing the four - momentum @xmath35 on each side of the cut : @xmath36 . for example , the one - loop bubble graph shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bubble ] has two propagators ( @xmath37 ) , so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath30 is obtained by examining the momentum flowing across the only possible cut ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the crucial point in the negative - dimension approach is that the gaussian integral ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) is an analytic function of the space - time dimension .",
    "hence it is possible to consider @xmath43 and to make the definition @xcite @xmath44 for positive values of @xmath0 .",
    "we see that by expanding the exponential in ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) and inserting the definition ( [ eq : def ] ) , after the exchange of the integration with respect to the summation @xmath45 we recover the original result , provided that @xmath1 is both negative and even ( so that the kronecker @xmath46 can be satisfied and the contribution with @xmath47 selected from the sum ) .",
    "we note that , with this definition , negative - dimensional integrals can be shown to obey the necessary translation properties @xcite .      for the one - loop integrals we are interested in here , we follow the approach suggested by suzuki and schmidt  @xcite@xcite and view eqs .",

    "( [ eq : form1 ] ) becomes @xmath48 where the @xmath49 are positive integers .",
    "the target loop integral is an infinite sum of ( integrals over the schwinger parameters of ) loop integrals with negative powers of the propagators .",
    "likewise , we expand the exponentials in eq .",

    "( [ eq : lhs_expans ] ) and  ( [ eq : mult_expans ] ) give @xmath56 with the constraints expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraints ] ) .",
    "we recall that each of the @xmath32 is a bilinear in the schwinger parameters , so that the target loop integral is now an infinite sum of powers of the scales of the process ( with each of the @xmath57 and the @xmath58 raised to a different summation variable ) integrated over the schwinger parameters",
    ".    equations  ( [ eq : lhs ] ) and  ( [ eq : rhs ] ) are two different expressions for the same quantity : @xmath59 .",
    "however , rather than performing the integrals over the @xmath19 s , we use the fact that the @xmath19 s are independent parameters , so that the integrands themselves must be equivalent : [ eq : lhs_rhs ] & & _ n_1,  ,n_n=0^ i_n^d@xmath60 _ i=1^n = + & & _ p_1,  ,p_n = 0 ^  ( p_1+  +p_n ) ! comparing term by term the left - hand - side ( lhs ) with the right - hand - side ( rhs ) allows us to read off the value of @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the coefficient of the term @xmath61 in the lhs of eq .  ( [ eq : lhs_rhs ] ) , where the @xmath18 are negative integers , is given by @xmath62 this term is equal to the coefficient of the term @xmath63 in the rhs of eq .  ( [ eq : lhs_rhs ] ) . writing a general expression is not possible , since the @xmath32 are process dependent .",
