    "the geometry of excursion sets for gaussian random fields has been a subject of intense research over the last fifteen years ; much work has focussed on the investigation of the euler - poincar characteristic , henceforth epc @xcite .",
    "we recall here that the epc @xmath2 is the unique integer - valued functional , defined on the ring @xmath3 of closed convex sets in @xmath4 , which equals @xmath5 if @xmath6 , @xmath7 if @xmath8 is homotopic to the unit ball , and satisfies the additivity property @xmath9 clearly , the epc is a topological invariant ( i.e. it is invariant under homeomorphisms ) ; its investigation for the excursion sets of random fields was initiated in the late seventies by robert adler and his co - authors .",

    "the latter question is of both theoretical and applied interest ; for instance , in the recent paper @xcite five different methods are suggested to estimate numerically the covariance matrix of the epc characteristic for the joint excursion sets at various thresholds .",
    "these results were subsequently exploited to approximate excursion probabilities , the so - called euler - poincar heuristic @xcite section 5.1 .    in this paper , we establish analytic formulae for the covariance of the epc characteristic of excursion sets at different thresholds , focussing on an important class of fields : gaussian spherical harmonics .",
    "we establish a rather simple expression which seems to be closely related to a second - order gaussian kinematic formula , in a sense to be made clear below .",

    "for a given eigenvalue @xmath35 , the corresponding eigenspace is the @xmath36-dimensional space of spherical harmonics of degree @xmath37 ; we can choose an arbitrary @xmath38-orthonormal basis @xmath39 , and consider random eigenfunctions of the form @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 are independent , standard gaussian variables .",
