    "polymers in mixed solvents show different properties than in individual solvents raising interesting questions from a fundamental point of view @xcite .",
    "specific features of these systems originate from incompatibility of the two solvents and asymmetry of their interactions with the polymer . if the system exhibits a preferential adsorption of one solvent with the polymer , a difference of solvent composition inside and outside the polymer domain is observed @xcite .",
    "another peculiar behavior of dilute solutions of polymers in binary mixtures of bad solvents is cosolvency @xcite this behavior is quite unexpected since two non solvents for the polymer turn out to present together the properties of a good solvent which is unusual from the point of view of excluded volume effects .",
    "if no specific interactions exist between particles in the mixture such as hydrogen bonds or long range electrostatic interaction , one would expect that a mixed solvent exhibits a smooth transition from one solvent quality to the other as the solvent composition changes from 0 to 1 and the solvent power should be an averaged value of its individual components .",
    "this is not the case in cosolvent systems where sharp changes characteristic of first order transitions take place .",
    "these transitions can be monitored through variations of radii of gyration , second virial coefficients , solution viscosities ... with the solvent composition .    in recent years , with the development of new techniques of polymer characterization using molecular labeling , dyes and neutron scattering techniques , ... widespread research of polymers in mixed solvents has been witnessed in an attempt to understand better their fundamental properties .",

    "if @xmath83 the interaction between polymer and solvent b is smaller than @xmath84 , the quantity @xmath80 is negative and the critical parameter decreases ( i.e.@xmath85 ) .",
    "this means that the polymer favors solvent demixing since a smaller interaction drives the solvents to the limit of stability .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath86= 100 , @xmath75= 0.01 and @xmath87=0.495 , gives @xmath88 .",
    "this means that if @xmath83 is smaller than 1.5 , @xmath80 is negative and addition of a small amount of polymer ( approximately 1 percent ) induces phase separation of the solvent mixture .",
    "if @xmath83 is higher than @xmath89 , the system behaves differently since addition of polymer would result into a positive @xmath80 indicating compatibility enhancement of the solvent mixture .",
    "the mixture phase separates only under a strong repulsion between @xmath90 and @xmath91 solvents .",
    "these features can be observed in @xmath92 @xmath45 where @xmath93 is plotted against @xmath75 for two values of @xmath83 .",
    "one observes different tendencies , depending upon the value of the interaction parameter @xmath83 .",
    "for the lower value , there is a slight decrease of @xmath93 upon addition of polymer .",
    "if @xmath83 is as high as 1.5 expressing a large polymer - solvent b incompatibility , a small amount of polymer would result into a large increase of @xmath80 meaning that the solvents a and b prefer to remain mixed rather than adsorbing on the polymer even though the interaction @xmath69 chosen in plotting this figure @xmath94 is relatively high .",
    "this compatibility enhancement of the mixed solvent due to the presence of polymer is quite spectacular since @xmath93 increases by practically an order of magnitude upon addition of a small amount of polymer .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior is consistent with the observation made on ps/(benzene+cyclohexane ) by varra and autalik @xcite .",
    "these authors found that a strong interactions between ps and non solvents ( cyclohexane ) could lead to a reduced solvent - solvent interaction and hence a compatibility enhancement of the mixture .",
    "furthermore , one finds that the shift @xmath95 is only moderately sensitive to the interaction asymmetry between the polymer and the solvents a and b which is expressed by the parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the shift in the critical parameter @xmath80 is strong upon addition of polymer even for small values of @xmath97 .",
    "the interaction asymmetry parameter plays a more crucial role in connection with the polymer conformation near the solvent criticality condition as we shall see in the following section .",
    "the effective potential @xmath98 of equation ( 16 ) is directly related to the classical excluded volume parameter acting on a polymer in the infinite dilute limit .",
    "this is made clear by writing the partial structure factor @xmath99 in the reciprocal form similar to zimm s equation @xmath100 letting @xmath101 one obtains @xmath102 for an upper critical solution temperature mixture , the interaction parameter @xmath69 increases approaching @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", the polymer reacts in different ways depending essentially on whether @xmath97 is zero or not .",
    "this is a clear illustration of the importance of interaction asymmetry between polymer and solvents in determining the thermodynamic behavior of the solution .",
    "as the solvent mixture approaches the criticality condition ( @xmath103 ) , a striking difference exists between the case where the solvents present the same interaction with the polymer ( @xmath104 ) and the case where the two solvents interact differently with the polymer ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "equation ( 31 ) shows that in the case of a symmetric interaction @xmath106 , @xmath98 decreases linearly with @xmath107 .",
    "however , in the non symmetric interaction problem @xmath108 , the third term in the rhs of equation ( 31 ) increases rapidly as @xmath103 and @xmath98 undergoes a rapid decrease . following this sharp decrease",
    ", the effective potential vanishes and may even become negative as @xmath69 approaches @xmath70 .",
    "the chain undergoes a phase transition from a swollen state to unperturbed dimensions or even a collapsed configuration .",
    "this is illustrated in @xmath92 @xmath109 where @xmath110 is represented as a function of @xmath107 for @xmath111 and 0.2 .",
    "the upper curve in this figure corresponds to the case where the interaction between polymer and solvents a and b are the same and @xmath112 .",

    ". this approximation could be easily relaxed if one wants to include intramolecular interferences within the solvent particles themselves and explore by radiation scattering the internal structure of chains .",

    "@xmath127 decreases continuously when @xmath103 while for @xmath128 , @xmath127 increases suddenly when @xmath107 approaches zero .",
    "one can visualize the polymer as a chain of blobs of size @xmath124 .",
    "over distances below the blob size , the chain is sensitive to solvent fluctuations and its size reduces as a result of increasing effective interaction @xmath114 . over distances exceeding the blob size",
    ", the chain does not feel the effects of solvent fluctuations and shows a comparatively swollen conformation . as the solvent approaches criticality when @xmath103 , the correlation length @xmath124 becomes comparable or larger than @xmath125 implying that the entire chain is subject to solvent fluctuations and undergoes a phase transition from a swollen to a more compact conformation . for @xmath111 and @xmath129 ,",
    "the chain feels theta solvent conditions even though @xmath103 and solvents demixing conditions are approached .",
    "the blob picture for a polymer in mixed solvents was first suggested by brochard and de gennes @xcite who examined the polymer conformation in a mixture of two good solvents , when the polymer affinity differs substantially for the two solvents .",
    "they were the first to predict that the polymer adopts a collapsed configuration near @xmath68 even it would be swollen in either of the pure solvents under similar conditions .",
    "in this section , we discuss the problem of many chains by extending the edwards hamiltonian formalism to strong solutions of polymers and mixed solvents .",
    "the effective potential acting on a test chain together with partial structure factors are calculated as a function of polymer concentration and mixed solvent properties .",

    "if this asymmetry is large , as the mixed solvent approaches the criticality condition , the effective interaction polymer - solvent increases dramatically .",
    "the polymer undergoes a phase transition from a swollen configuration to unperturbed dimensions and eventually to a collapsed configuration as the mixed solvent approaches criticality .",
    "when the correlation length for solvent fluctuations is of the order or higher than the radius of gyration of polymer @xmath125 , the chain conformation becomes characteristic of a polymer in bad solvents and the effective excluded volume parameter vanishes and may even become negative .    in the many chain problem of strong solutions ,",
    "the effective potential acting on a test chain is calculated using the same formalism based on the edwards hamiltonian .",
    "this potential is related to the bare effective potential in the infinite dilute limit via a series expansion which is reminiscent of the ornstein - zernike model .",
    "this series expansion is represented graphically via a diagrammatic method where the successive diagrams represent interactions involving increasing numbers of intermediate chains .",
    "if the solvent mixture is critical , interesting results are obtained for the structure factor of the polymer and a test chain .",
    "if the solvent mixture is near criticality , all excluded volume interactions are screened out and chains in the medium feel theta solvent conditions .",
    "this investigation is based upon the edwards hamiltonian formalism and gives a qualitative picture of the thermodynamic behavior and structural properties of polymers in mixed solvents .",
    "near critical regions where the fluctuations are strong , one has to rely on an appropriate model to achieve a more rigorous quantitative evaluation of the effects of critical fluctuations on the thermodynamic and the scattering properties of polymers in mixed solvents .",
    "this could be done within the framework of field theoretical or renormalization group theory calculations .",
