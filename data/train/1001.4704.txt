    "psr j1012 + 5307 is a 5.3ms pulsar in a low eccentricity binary system with orbital period of @xmath014.5h @xcite and a low mass helium white dwarf ( wd ) companion @xcite .",
    "ref .   compared the measured optical luminosity of the wd to the value expected from wd models and calculated a distance of @xmath1pc . in addition they measured , a radial velocity component of @xmath2kms@xmath3 relative to the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) , and the mass ratio of the pulsar and its companion @xmath4 .",
    "finally they derived a companion mass of @xmath5 , a pulsar mass of @xmath6 and an orbital inclination angle of @xmath7 .",
    "ref .   presented the timing analysis of psr j1012 + 5307 using 4 years of timing data from effelsberg and 7 years from lovell radio telescope .",
    "they derived the spin , astrometric and binary parameters for the system and they discussed the prospects of future measurements of a post - keplerian parameter ( pk ) which can contribute to the derivation of stringent limits on alternative gravity theories .",
    "in this work psr j1012 + 5307 has been revisited with seven more years of high - precision timing data and combined datasets from the epta telescopes ( effelsberg , lovell , nanay , westerbork ) , at five different frequencies .",
    "the data have been analysed using the timing software tempo and all the astrometric , spin and binary parameters of this system have been improved .",
    "for the first time a parallax @xmath8mas has been measured for psr j1012 + 5307 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath9pc which is consistent with the @xmath1 pc measured from the optical observations .    as predicted by ref .",
    "a significant measurement of the change in the orbital period of the system , @xmath10 , has been obtained for the first time .",
    "this is caused by the doppler correction ( which is the combined effect of the proper motion of the system @xcite and a correction term for the galactic acceleration ) and by a contribution due to the quadrupole term of the gravitational wave emission , as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "after subtracting these two contributions from our measured value , the excess value of @xmath11 confirms the validity of gr for one more millisecond pulsar binary system .",
    "all the terms mentioned above are the ones expected to contribute by using gr as our theory of gravity . however , there are alternative theories of gravity , that violate the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) and predict extra contributions to the observed orbital period variation .",
    "one is the dipole term of the gravitational wave emission , which results from the difference in gravitational binding energy of the two bodies of a binary system .",
    "thus psr j1012 + 5307 , a pulsar - wd system , is ideal for testing the strength of such emission . for small - eccentricity pulsar - wd systems , where the sensitivity @xmath12 ( related to the gravitational self - energy of a body ) of the wd is much smaller than the one of the pulsar",
    ", one finds @xmath13 , @xcite where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the reduced mass ; @xmath16 is the sensitivity of the pulsar and @xmath17 refers to the dipole self - gravitational contribution .",
    "another term is predicted by a hypothetical variation of the locally measured gravitational constant as the universe expands , @xmath18 p_{b } $ ] , @xcite where @xmath19 is the total mass of the system .",
    "it has been shown that there is no need to add these extra contributions to explain the variations of the orbital period , however the excess value has been used to set limits for a wide class of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "psr j1012 + 5307 is an ideal lab for constraining the dipole radiation term because the wd nature of the companion is affirmed optically , the mass estimates are free of any explicit strong - field effects and the mass of the pulsar is rather high , which is important in the case of strong field effects that occur only above a certain critical mass , like the spontaneous scalarisation @xcite .",
    "thus , by using the @xmath20yr@xmath3 limit from the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) @xcite the @xmath21 contribution has been calculated and subtracted from our excess value in order to finally obtain an improved generic limit for the dipole contribution of @xmath22 ( 95 per cent c.l . ) .",
    "a generic test for @xmath23 can not be done with a single binary pulsar , since , in general , theories that predict a variation of the gravitational constant typically also predict the existence of dipole radiation .",
    "this degeneracy has been broken here in a joint analysis of psr j1012 + 5307 and psr j0437@xmath244715 @xcite , two binary pulsar - wd systems with tight limits for @xmath25 and different orbital periods . by applying eq .",
    "1 @xmath26 - 4 \\pi^2 \\frac{t_\\odot\\mu}{p_b^2 } \\ , \\kappa_{\\rm d } s_p^2\\ ] ] to both binary pulsars , and solving in a monte - carlo simulation this set of two equations , stringent and generic limits based purely on pulsar data and in the strong field regime have been obtained . with a 95 per cent c.l . ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the future",
    ", more accurate measurements of @xmath29 and distance of the two pulsars and wds could constrain even more our derived limits .    a more detailed work on this study of psr j1012",
    "+ 5307 can be found in ref .  .",
