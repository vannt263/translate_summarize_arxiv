    "recent experiments have prepared quantum degenerate gases of homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules in electronic and vibrational ground states @xcite .",
    "heteronuclear molecules , in particular , have large electric dipole moments associated with the rotational excitations , the new feature of polar molecular gases is thus the strong , anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions between the molecules , which can be controlled with external electric fields @xcite . when dc electric fields are applied to polarize molecules , a major obstacle is given by the increase of inelastic collision rates corresponding to chemical reactions between the molecules , as in the case of krb in the recent jila experiments",
    ". however , these can be strongly suppressed , and thus the gas stabilized by tightly confining the molecules in a single plane of a quasi-2d geometry@xcite .",
    "this relies on the fact that for induced electric dipole moments perpendicular to the plane of confinement , the dipolar forces will be repulsive in - plane , thus suppressing short distance inelastic collisions .",
    "such a 2d confinement can be achieved by loading the gas of polar molecules into a 1d optical lattice .",
    "this leads naturally to a setup of a multilayer polar gas where , however , forces between dipoles in different layers can be attractive , and the collapse is prevented by a sufficiently high optical potential barrier . for a bilayer system",
    "this attraction can lead to the formation of bound pairs of polar molecules , reminiscent of bilayer excitons , and in a multilayer configuration to the formation of strings of molecules .",
    "in particular , in a gas of single component fermions loaded in a tight bilayer trap , as realized with krb , this will give rise to an s - wave bcs superfluid transition @xcite ( for @xmath0-wave pairing in a monolayer of polar molecules see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study this bilayer bcs superfluid transition in some detail , in particular we go beyond ref .",
    "@xcite with emphasis on the inclusion of many body effects .    in the bilayer bcs superfluid",
    "the single species polar molecules in the two layers provides the system with a two - component character , where two species are particles on different layers coupled by the long - range dipole interaction , allowing fermions from different layers interact in the @xmath1-wave channel that is dominant at low energies .",
    "this interlayer interaction results in very peculiar properties in both a two - body system : the existence of interlayer bound states @xcite-@xcite and various regimes of the interlayer scattering @xcite , and in a many - body system : interlayer bcs pairing @xcite and bcs - bec crossover @xcite , @xcite . based on a detailed analysis of various regimes of interlayer and intralayer scattering , we extend the analysis of the interlayer superfluid pairing beyond the standard bcs approach @xcite by including many - body contributions resulting in the mass renormalization , as well as in additional contributions to the pairing interaction .",
    "we perform the calculation of the critical temperature in the regime of a weak interlayer coupling for the cases when the layer separation is both smaller ( dilute regime ) and of the order or larger ( dense regime ) than the mean interparticle separation in each layer . as found , the many - body effects have a pronounced effect on the critical temperature , and could either decrease ( in the very dilute limit ) or increases ( in the dense and moderately dilute limits ) the transition temperature as compared to the bcs approach .",

    "the considered single - component fermionic bilayer dipolar system provides an example of a relatively simple many - body system in which an entire range of nontrivial many - body phenomena are solely tied to the dipole - dipole interparticle interaction with its unique properties : long - range and anisotropy .",
    "the long - range character provides an interparticle interaction in single component fermi gases inside each layer which otherwise would remain essentially noninteracting . for the considered setup ,",
    "this intralayer interaction is always repulsive and gives rise to the crystalline phase for a large density of particles . more important",
    ", the long - range dipole - dipole interaction couples particles from different layers in a very specific form resulting from the anisotropy of the interaction : two particle from different layers attract each other at short , and repel each other at large distances , respectively .",
    "the potential well at short distances is strong enough to support at least one bound state for any strength of interlayer coupling . for a weak coupling between layers ,",
    "the bound state is extremely shallow and has an exponentially large size .",
    "however , in the intermediate and strong coupling cases the size of the deepest bound state becomes comparable with the interlayer separation . in the fermionic many - body system",
    "this behavior of the interlayer interaction leads to a bcs state with interlayer cooper pairs in the weak ( interlayer ) coupling regime when the size of the bound state is larger than the interparticle separation ( in other words , the fermi energy is larger than the binding energy ) . with increasing interlayer coupling",
    ", this bcs state smoothly transforms into a bec state of tightly bound interlayer molecules when the interparticle separation is larger than the size of the bound state . of course , the bec regime and bec - bcs crossover are only possible when the mean interparticle separation in each layer is larger than the distance between the layers .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the regime of a weak intra- and interlayer interactions , that allows the usage of controllable calculations on the basis of the perturbation theory , and consider in details the formation of the interlayer bcs state . before entering the technical derivation",
    ", it seems worthwhile to briefly identify the relevant parameters and parameter regimes for the bilayer many body system of single species fermionic dipoles .",
    "in addition , we will point out , where the relevant results and discussions for these parameter regimes can be found in later parts of the paper .",
    "it follows from the previous discussion that the considered system is characterized by three characteristic lengths : the dipolar length @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of dipolar particles with the ( induced ) dipole moment @xmath4 , the interlayer separation @xmath5 , and the mean interparticle separation inside each layer @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the fermi wave vector for a 2d single - component fermionic gas with the density @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the physics of the system is completely determined by two dimensionless parameters which are independent ratios of the above lengths .",
    "the first parameter @xmath9 is the ratio of the dipolar length and the interlayer separation , @xmath10 , and is a measure of the interlayer interaction strength relevant for pairing . in experiments with polar molecules ,",
    "the values of the dipolar length @xmath11 is of the order of @xmath12 : for a @xmath13 with currently available @xmath14 one has @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 for the maximum value @xmath17 ) , and for @xmath18 with the tunable dipole moment from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in an external electric field @xmath21 the value of @xmath11 varies from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . for the interlayer separation",
    "@xmath24 these values of @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "the second parameter @xmath26 measures the interlayer separation in units of the mean interparticle distance in each layer .",
    "this parameter can also be both smaller ( dilute regime ) and of the order or larger ( dense regime ) than unity for densities @xmath27 ( for , example , for @xmath24 one has @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) .",
    "the two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath26 determine the regime of interlayer scattering at typical energies of particles ( @xmath30 fermi energy @xmath31 ) , and their product , @xmath32 , being the ratio of the dipolar length and the mean interparticle separation inside each layer , controls the perturbative expansion in the system and , therefore , many - body effects .",
    "the existence of different regimes of the interlayer scattering originates from two characteristic features of the interlayer dipole - dipole interaction , as discussed in the context of eq .",
    "( [ v2d ] ) below : the presence of the typical range @xmath33 beyond which the interaction is attactive , and of the long - range dipole - dipole repulsive tail . as a result , the fourier component of the interaction ( see eq .",
