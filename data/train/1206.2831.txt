    "gsh ( brief for : _ granular solid hydrodynamics _ ) is a continual mechanical theory  @xcite constructed to account for a broad range of granular phenomena , including static stress distribution  ge-1,ge-2,granr1 , incremental stress - strain relation  @xcite , yield  @xcite , propagation and damping of elastic waves  @xcite , elasto - plastic motion  @xcite , the critical state  @xcite , shear band and fast dense flow  @xcite .",
    "an important input of gsh is an expression for the elastic energy needed to deform the grains  @xcite .",
    "the energy density @xmath2 is a function of the elastic strain @xmath3 , which we define as the long - scaled , coarse - grained measure of how and how much the grains are deformed .",
    "therefore , both the elastic energy @xmath4 and the stress @xmath5 ( which comes about only because the grains are deformed ) are necessarily functions of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath6 because @xmath5 is closely related to the force , and @xmath3 to the coordinate .",
    "so @xmath5 is given if @xmath4 is .",
    "the relation between the elastic and total strain @xmath7 is only simple at small increments , where @xmath8 holds .",
    "more generally , it is given by the evolution equation of @xmath3  @xcite , and not by a function , because only @xmath3 is a state variable , not @xmath7 .",
    "as it turns out , the critical state is simply the stationary solution of @xmath3 s evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "the expression @xmath2 is an input of gsh .",
    "it may either be deduced microscopically , or obtained iteratively in a trial and error process , by comparing the ramification of the proposed expression with experimental observations . as the first method is notoriously difficult , we choose trial and error .",
    "the original expression , @xmath9 is very simple , and a function of only two invariants , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "( @xmath12 is the traceless or deviatoric strain . )",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are two ( density dependent ) elastic coefficients .",
    "the dependence on the third invariant @xmath15 is neglected . nevertheless , a number of granular features are contained in this expression .",
    "first of all , the measured velocity of elastic waves  @xcite are well rendered  ge4 .",
    "second , satisfactory agreement was achieved  @xcite with the incremental stress - strain relation as observed and reported in  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "one is looking at small increment of the elastic strain , @xmath16 , and the calculation employing eq  ( [ w0 ] ) is purely elastic ( or hyperelastic ) : @xmath17 third , the drucker - prager yield surface , requiring a granular system at rest to have a ratio of shear stress @xmath18 and pressure @xmath19 smaller than a certain value , @xmath20  constant , is , as explained next , an integral part of this expression .    generally speaking , in a space spanned by stress components ,",
    "there is a surface that divides two regions in any granular media , one in which the grains necessarily move , another in which they may be at rest .",
    "this surface is usually referred to as the yield surface . aiming to make its definition more precise",
    ", we take the yield surface to be the divide between one region in which elastic solutions are stable , and another in which they are not  clearly , the medium may be at rest for a given stress only if an appropriate elastic solution is stable . since the elastic energy of a solution satisfying the equilibrium condition @xmath21 is an extremum  @xcite ,",
    "the elastic energy is convex and minimal in the stable region , concave and maximal in the unstable one . in the latter case",
    ", an infinitesimal perturbation suffices to destroy the solution .",
    "the elastic energy of eq  ( [ w0 ] ) is convex only for @xmath22    in this paper , we propose a slight generalization of the energy , by including the third invariant @xmath23 and its elastic coefficient @xmath24 , as @xmath25 we shall in the rest of the paper examine its ramifications .",
    "there are many different yield surfaces in the literature .",
    "the first was proposed by coulomb , who observed that slopes of sand piles never exceed a critical value and saw an analogy with the friction law  @xcite , @xmath26where @xmath27 is the internal friction angle , a material parameter , and @xmath28 are eigenvalues of @xmath29 , ordered by their magnitude .",
    "although the coulomb yield model is widely used for estimating the stability of granular materials at rest  nedderman , a number of other models are also frequently used by engineers , depending on personal preference and experience , especially those by drucker and prager@xcite , lade and duncan  @xcite , matsuoka and nakai  @xcite , given respectively as @xmath30as we shall see below , all three yield models are also reproduced in satisfactory approximation by the new energy expression .",
    "in addition , it also improves on other residual discrepancies between the elastic theory and measurements , such as in the incremental stress - strain data , or the speed of elastic waves .",
    "all this indicates that the new energy , now with three parameters : @xmath31 , is capable of giving a more accurate description of granular elasticity .",
    "we note that the new cubic term in eq  ( [ w ] ) was first introduced by humrickhouse in  @xcite , in an attempt to increase the maximum angle @xmath32 of inclination , at which a granular layer remains stable . unfortunately , he only considered negative values of @xmath24 . as these did not yield any improvement",
    ", he abandoned this term .",
    "as we shall see in section ii , a positive @xmath24 does yield a larger @xmath32 , of around @xmath1 . in section iii",
    ", we deduce the yield surface associated with eq  ( [ w ] ) ; in section iv , incremental stress - strain relation and granular acoustics are studied .",
    "all support a positive @xmath33 .",
    "section v contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "we consider noncohensive granular materials , with constant mass density @xmath34 . denoting @xmath35",
    "the @xmath36 hessian matrix of the function @xmath37 is @xmath38 with @xmath39 and the eigenvalues @xmath40 .",
    "the associated yield surface , written as a function of the stress components , is given by @xmath41 as the eigenvalues frequently lack analytic expressions , we consider instead its determinant , @xmath42 .",
    "this is of course only a necessary condition , as we need to ensure that the vanishing eigenvalue is the smallest one , @xmath43 , while the other ones are larger .",
    "this is done numerically .",
    "next , consider an infinite granular layer in gravity , inclined by an angle @xmath44 , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the elastic strain is taken to assume the form  @xcite @xmath45     and @xmath46 calculated with the potential eq  ( w ) and the strain eq  ( [ inc - uij ] ) . ]    with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 . inserting the strain",
    "eq  ( [ inc - uij ] ) into ( [ sxz],szz-1 ) , we obtain @xmath49 in addition , because of the force balance @xmath50 , the two stresses are also related by @xmath51it is worth remarking that if we insert the strain eq  ( [ inc - uij ] ) into the hessian matrix @xmath52 , we find for @xmath53 that two eigenvalues are @xmath54 , implying that a stable layer exists only for @xmath55 , because at least one eigenvalue is negative for @xmath56 .",

    "the biggest value @xmath76 is achieved at @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "more specifically , as @xmath33 increases from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , the peak of @xmath81 versus @xmath74 increases too , but decreases after that .    a final remark : the elastic strain of eq  ( [ inc - uij ] ) is a result of assuming that displacement vector @xmath82 varies only with the layer depth @xmath83 , and has nonvanishing components along the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions , @xmath86 .",
    "then yield , at @xmath87 , occurs simultaneously in the whole layer .",
    "this is an idealization . in reality",
    ", the displacement vector should also have a nonvanishing @xmath88 component .",

    "a further important elastic property is the speed @xmath165 of elastic waves , which can be calculated from the square root of the appropriate eigenvalues of the acoustic tensor , see  @xcite,@xmath166where @xmath167 is the wave vector of propagation , with @xmath168 . inserting the energy of eq  ( [ w ] ) into ( [ sound - matrix ] ) , and eliminating the strain with the help of eq  ( [ sigma - ij ] )",

    "such a calculation with @xmath122 has been given in  @xcite , resulting in satisfactory agreement , though the weak variation of the transverse wave velocity with varying polarization and direction of propagation was not reproduced .",
    "here , we focus on this and the additional difference taking @xmath130 .",
    "since the energy is a homogenous function of the strain , or equivalently the stress , the stress dependence of the velocities can be factorized as @xmath170 , where the factor @xmath171 represents the influences of shear stresses on sound speeds ( from which the values of the parameters @xmath172 may be obtained with great accuracy ) .",

    "[ fig5]-a ) and radial directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]-b )",
    ". then @xmath173 depends only on @xmath175 , or equivalently on @xmath176 .",

    "@xmath178 is the atmosphere pressure . ]",
    "finally , we note that irrespective of the energy expression , there can only be two different transverse velocities in a cylindrical geometry along the principle axes . therefore ,",
    "if hardened experimental evidences to the contrary arises , this would indeed be a reason to include an additional variable such as the intrinsic anisotropy .    assuming a general expression for the energy , @xmath179 , with @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , we calculate the stress as @xmath183 where @xmath184 depend on the energy @xmath185 .",
    "similarly , the stiffness tensor @xmath186 is generally given as @xmath187 with @xmath188 again to be calculated from @xmath185 .",

    "note also that without @xmath209 that stems from the third invariant , only one transverse velocitiy exists .",
    "macroscopically speaking , granular media at rest are elastic , and one can account for all its static , mechanic behavior including yield , compliance coefficients , and sound propagation by a single potential , the elastic energy . finding an",
    "quantitatively appropriate potential is certainly interesting and useful , and the expression given in eq   ( [ w ] ) seems a good starting point .",
    "it is a generalization of the potential given in  granr1,jl1 , with a term depending on the cubic strain invariant .",
    "all empirical yield models and the other experiments considered above support this term . as mentioned in the introduction , yield models in soil mechanics are usually selected by personal experience , preference or convenience , and there seems no consensus which one is best .",
    "the uncertainty of the situation may be reduced with the help of the considered potential , as it unifies these models , and link them to other easily measurable elastic properties such as sound speeds , and compliance tensor . in this context",
    ", we would like to stress the importance of more accurate and systematic experiments , such as simultaneous measurement of sound velocity and yield .",
    "it is important to realize that yield as considered here happens at the highest possible stress at which the system may maintain an elastic , static solution .",
    "it is different from that obtained under stead shear : when approaching the critical state from an isotropic one , the approach is not monotonous if the starting density is high , and the limiting , so - called critical stress is lower than some of the stress values the system has undergone .",
    "at all these stress states , if the strain rate is stopped , the system will stop as well and retain its stress statically .",
    "therefore , it is still below yield at all these stress states .",
    "measurements carried out with steady shearing samples therefore do not reveal the yield surface . interpreting the results as such will lead to discrepancies .",
    "moreover , density also influences elastic properties of granular materials , which was considered in  @xcite , but is neglected here for simplicity . in  @xcite , we have shown how to include the density dependence of the energy @xmath4 to account for the so - called  cap \"  @xcite , or the sound velocity as measured by hardin and richart  @xcite .",
    "these features are easily transferred to the energy of eq  ( [ w ] ) .",
    "summarizing , we believe that although the details of granular elasticity is complicated , and more accurate experiments are needed for further clarification , eq  ( [ w ] ) provides a reasonable start point .",
    "from the energy of eq  ( [ w ] ) , we may calculate the stress as a function of the elastic strain via @xmath210 , obtaining @xmath211and@xmath212@xmath213   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]clearly , if the strain is diagonal , the stress is too . in the principle",
