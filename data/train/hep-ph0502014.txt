    "the first evidence of supersymmetry to be found may not be the direct production of superpartners but the observation of lepton flavor violating processes .",
    "it is therefore crucial to learn how to extract supersymmetric parameters from the measured rates of such processes . in this paper",
    "we show that such a project is , at least in principle , feasible .",
    "even if supersymmetric particles have not been detected , the observation of lfv processes can constrain the supersymmetric parameter space .    being so large ,",
    "the parameter space of the general mssm is very difficult to handle .",
    "that is the reason why it is common to focus attention on the minimal supergravity model -msugra- , in which all the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses , the three gaugino masses and all trilinear couplings are required to have a common value at the unification scale respectively @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by solving the renormalization group equations with these boundary conditions ,",
    "the weak scale superparticle spectrum is obtained .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking allows the determination of the supersymmetric higgs mixing parameter @xmath7 and the expression of the soft susy breaking bilinear term @xmath8 in terms of @xmath9 , the ratio of the vev s of the two higgs fields .",
    "hence , in msugra all sparticle masses and couplings are obtained in terms of the parameter set @xmath10 though msugra is not the only possible supersymmetric framework , it undoubtedly is an appealing and predictive model suitable to test new ideas and we will limit our following discussion to it .    to take into account neutrino masses , the mssm must be extended .",
    "the simplest way of generating non - zero neutrino masses is with the addition of right - handed neutrinos through the see saw mechanism .",
    "a remarkable prediction of this extension of the mssm is that , through renormalization , the left - handed slepton mass matrix , @xmath11 , acquires flavor violating ( off - diagonal ) contributions , @xmath12 these corrections manifest themselves at low energies by inducing lepton flavor violating processes mediated by supersymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "if those contributions were known we could predict the rate of lfv processes for any given set of msugra parameters .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath13 not only is not known but can not be reconstructed from low energy data . the usual way of dealing with this problem has been to assume additional flavor symmetries that reduce the number of free parameters and allow to compute such off - diagonal elements",
    "hence , a given symmetry typically implies a prediction for lfv processes and from it constraints on the msugra parameter space can be derived .",
    "the many studies of this kind that have been done @xcite , though necessarily model dependent , have shown that lfv processes are likely to be observed in planned and ongoing experiments . moreover , due to the significant improvements on the experimental limits that they will reach @xcite , it may well be that supersymmetry is discovered through lepton flavor violation even before its direct detection at the lhc @xcite .",
    "this is , after all , a common pattern in high - energy physics : new particles are first detected through their virtual effects and only afterward are directly produced . and such effects usually allow to constrain the particles properties or the kind of new physics that is behind them .",
    "will the observation of lfv processes reveals us anything about supersymmetry ?",
    "we shall show that the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 conversion in nuclei determine the sign of @xmath16 and constrain @xmath17 .",
    "if the supersymmetric spectrum is not known , the observation of a single lepton flavor violating process , though of great importance , can not tell us anything about the parameter space of msugra .",
    "indeed , different combinations of msugra parameters and off - diagonal elements may yield the same rate for a given process . to constrain msugra in a model independent way ,",
    "therefore , it is necessary to observe at least two of these processes and to look for possible correlations among them .",
    "because it provides the strongest constraint on @xmath15 flavor violation , we will use the decay @xmath18 as the reference process to correlate with .",
    "other lfv processes that might be related to @xmath18 include @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath15 conversion in nuclei .",
    "the off - shell amplitude for @xmath21 , that gives a significant contribution to a wide class of lepton flavor violating processes , may be written as @xmath22u_j(p ) \\label{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the momentum of the photon , @xmath24 is the electric charge , @xmath25 the photon polarization vector , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the wave functions of the initial and final leptons , @xmath28 is the momentum of the particle @xmath29 , and explicit expressions for the coefficients can be found in @xcite .",
    "since each coefficient receives contributions from both chargino - sneutrino and neutralino - slepton loops , the amplitude depends on several supersymmetric masses . on the other hand , in the mass insertion approximation",
    "is easily seen that all four coefficients are proportional to the corresponding off - diagonal element and consequently @xmath30 .",
    "the branching ratio of the decay @xmath18 is obtained from ( [ t ] ) , @xmath31 it depends only on the @xmath32 coefficients , which fulfill the relation @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath19 is a decay analogous to @xmath18 .",
    "they have the same loop structure but are induced by different off - diagonal elements in the left - handed slepton mass matrix , @xmath34 for @xmath18 and @xmath35 for @xmath19 . since these two quantities are in principle independent , correlations between @xmath19 and @xmath18 can not be used to get information about the msugra parameter space .",
    "to this end , we must search for other processes induced by the same off - diagonal element .",
    "that is , other @xmath15 transitions .",
    "the decay @xmath20 receives contributions from penguin - type diagrams and from box - type diagrams .",
    "it turns out , however , that the amplitude is dominated by a penguin - type contribution involving the same combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 that enters into @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , @xmath38 being constant over the whole parameter space , this ratio can not be used to constrain it .",
    "@xmath15 conversion in nuclei also receives contributions from penguin and box diagrams , and the @xmath39-penguin diagram dominates over a large portion of the parameter space . in that region ,",
    "the rate of @xmath15 conversion in nuclei is given by @xmath40 \\label{mue}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denote the proton number , @xmath42 is the effective charge of the muon in the @xmath43 state , @xmath44 is the nuclear form factor , and @xmath45 is the total capture rate . without loss of generality , we will limit our following discussion on @xmath15 conversion rates to the nucleus @xmath46 .",
    "then @xcite , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .    owing to the additional dependence of @xmath50   on the @xmath51 amplitudes ,",
    "the ratio @xmath52 is not expected to be constant .",
    "its value might contain useful information about supersymmetric parameters .",
    "in fact , since both @xmath14 and @xmath53 are proportional to @xmath54 , @xmath55 does not depend on it .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is determined exclusively by msugra parameters .",
    "we have thus identified @xmath15 conversion in a nucleus as a process that in conjunction with @xmath18 could allow us , through @xmath55 , to constrain the msugra parameter space . in the following section , we will investigate numerically such constraints .",
    "now we proceed to evaluate @xmath55 , as defined in ( [ cc ] ) , in msugra models with seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "the method we follow consists of scanning randomly the relevant set of soft - breaking terms . for each set",
    "we evaluate @xmath55 and display the results for different sets as scatter plots . in such plots , correlations , if they exist , must be evident .",
    "we will explore the following ranges for msugra parameters @xmath56 setting @xmath57 and taking into account both possible signs of @xmath16 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "concerning the origin of lepton flavor violation we will only assume that the dominant contribution to lepton flavor violating processes resides in the left - handed slepton mass matrix , as it happens in seesaw models , but without considering any particular structure for the neutrino yukawa couplings or any specific value for the off - diagonal elements .",
    "instead , we parametrize the matrix element @xmath59 -the relevant one for @xmath15 transitions- at low energies as @xmath60 being @xmath61 a free parameter . a suitable range for it is @xmath62 this low energy parametrization guarantees that our results are valid not only in see saw models but also in all models where lepton flavor violation is induced by the left - handed slepton mass matrix .    in the ranges we are considering for msugra parameters and the off - diagonal element , @xmath14 and @xmath53 vary over 10 orders of magnitude , confirming that it is not possible to make model independent predictions for these processes .",
    "a large part of such variation , however , comes from the off - diagonal element and cancels out in @xmath55 .",
    "scatter plots of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are shown in figures [ scatm0 ] and [ scatm12 ] .",
    "the points are concentrated in the narrow interval @xmath63 and there is a gap between points with @xmath64 and those with @xmath65 .",
    "these features can be easily understood .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ t ] ) satisfy @xmath66 and so @xmath67 whereas @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 whereas @xmath70 is always negative .",
    "thus , the gap observed in the figures comes from @xmath53 and is due to the change in the relative sign between @xmath37 and @xmath70 when @xmath16 changes sign .",
    "as expected from these considerations , @xmath71 is always larger than @xmath72 , and the gap between them is small because one of the two -@xmath73- is much larger than the other .",
    "since practically any given @xmath55 is compatible with all possible values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath55 can not constrain them .",
    "@xmath55 does determine the sign of @xmath16 , however .",
    "for instance , @xmath74 implies @xmath75 whereas @xmath76 implies @xmath77 .",
    "more interesting is the correlation of @xmath55 with @xmath17 ( see figure [ scat ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath70 is independent of @xmath17 whereas @xmath78 .",
    "hence , at low @xmath17 the interference between them in @xmath53 is stronger , giving rise to a larger gap .",
    "when @xmath17 increases , @xmath37 becomes much larger than @xmath70 and the gap gets consequently reduced .    due to the strong dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath17 , not all possible values of @xmath17 are compatible with a given @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 can be constrained .",
    "for example , @xmath79 would exclude the region @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that @xmath55 correlates nicely with the sign of @xmath16 and with @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath55 is measured it becomes possible to determine from it the sign of @xmath16 and to constrain @xmath17 at least in principle .",
    "indeed , to establish whether such measurements can be performed to the required accuracy is beyond the scope of the present work . by itself , that such neat and clear correlations between msugra parameters and lepton flavor violating observables exist independently of any particular flavor model is a new and remarkable result .",
    "possible extensions of this work would include the search for correlations in supersymmetric frameworks beyond msugra ; the study of the uncertainties associated with the measurement of @xmath55 and their implications for extracting supersymmetric parameters ; the inclusion of higher order ( two - loop ) contributions to lepton flavor violating processes ; the incorporation of all cosmological and phenomenological constraints on the parameter space .",
    "all these are interesting paths to be explored .",
    "we have shown that in msugra models the values of @xmath14 and the @xmath15 conversion rate in a nucleus determine the sign of @xmath16 and constrain @xmath17 practically in a model independent way .",
    "in fact , this result holds as long as the dominant source of lepton flavor violation resides in the left - handed slepton mass matrix .",
    "in particular , it is valid , independently of the value of the off - diagonal elements , in all models with seesaw induced neutrino masses .",
