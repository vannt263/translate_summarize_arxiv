    "<S> in addition , it is also possible to eliminate the remnant dd coupling error to a higher order with more elaborate pulse sequences such as the concatenated dd sequence khodjasteh2005fault , khodjasteh2007performance and reduce pulse errors by designing composite pulses or self - correcting sequences souza2011robust , souza2012robust , levitt1986composite , ryan2010robust . </S>",
