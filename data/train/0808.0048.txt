    "the measured properties of hadrons containing heavy quarks , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in bound states that probe kinematic regions not seen in light hadrons . to carry out calculations , effective field theories",
    "have been developed for systems including a single heavy quark , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , and two heavy quarks , nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "a number of tools have been adapted to work in the context of these effective field theories including lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite , and the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite .",
    "the measured properties presented in this paper help in constraining some of the approaches used within the effective field theories .    the tevatron , a @xmath1 tev @xmath2 collider , provides collisions for two multipurpose detectors , the d0 detector and the upgraded collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ii ) .",
    "pairs @xmath14 production is the dominant source of @xmath12 quarks with a cross section of @xmath15 @xmath16b  @xcite compared to a total inelastic cross section of @xmath17 mb .",
    "all measurements presented in this paper use between @xmath18 and @xmath19 fb@xmath20 of integrated luminosity of collisions measured by the d0 and cdf ii detectors .    throughout this paper charge conjugate modes are implied unless noted otherwise .",
    "the @xmath3 meson , the ground state meson consisting of a @xmath12 and @xmath13 quark , is unique among mesons since it both contains two heavy mesons and decays weakly .",
    "the doubly heavy nature of the @xmath3 allows for the application of nrqcd while calculating its properties , including the singular application of nrqcd to weak decay properties .",
    "the @xmath3 decays through three tree level processes : decay of the @xmath13 quark through a @xmath21 leaving a @xmath0 meson in the final state , decay of the @xmath12 quark through a @xmath21 leaving charmonium in the final state , and annihilation of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks leaving @xmath22 or @xmath23 in the final state .",
    "while the decays of the @xmath13 quark should be expected to have the largest branching fractions , channels involving the decay of the @xmath12 quark can be more useful from an experimental perspective since the reconstruction of the @xmath24 through the dimuon mode takes place at a higher efficiency than any modes involving a @xmath6 .",
    "table  [ bc_frac ] compares predictions for branching fractions of the @xmath3 to final states with @xmath24 and @xmath6 .    .predicted @xmath3 branching fractions for decay channels that are candidates for experimental analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bc_frac ]      nrqcd predicts a @xmath3 lifetime that is short compared to the @xmath26 lifetimes .",
    "calculations using qcd sum rules predict a lifetime of @xmath27 ps  @xcite , while calculations using the optical theorem and ope predict @xmath28 ps  @xcite with a range of @xmath29 ps depending on the value of the charm quark mass .",
    "the @xmath30 lifetime was first measured in cdf run i data and found to be @xmath31 ps  @xcite .",
    "d0 and cdf measure the @xmath30 lifetime in the inclusive @xmath32 decay mode , which is expected to be dominated by semileptonic decays to @xmath33 directly .",
    "d0 uses 1.3 fb@xmath20 of @xmath34 events while cdf uses 1.0 fb@xmath20 of @xmath35 where @xmath36 can be a muon or electron . for both experiments ,",
    "events are triggered on by the presences of the dimuon pair from the @xmath24 decay .",
    "the unmeasured particles in the inclusive decays require a correction to account for the missing momentum which can be modeled with a sample of simulated signal events and is defined as @xmath37 the missing momentum also implies a broad mass peak , so backgrounds are not estimated using mass sidebands . instead",
    ", background are modeled using data and and simulation and include : fake @xmath24 plus third lepton , true @xmath24 where the third lepton is faked by a hadron , true @xmath24 and leptons that do not originate from the same decay , and prompt @xmath24 plus a third lepton .",
    "the d0 measurement includes models of the mass distributions in a simultaneous fit of the lifetime and mass distributions , while the cdf measurement fits the lifetime distribution only .",
    "d0 measures the lifetime with world best precision  @xcite : @xmath38 systematic uncertainties limit further improvements in precision and are due to uncertainties in the mass and lifetime models used for the backgrounds .",
    "cdf measures the lifetime with similar precision  @xcite : @xmath39 for the cdf measurement , systematic uncertainties are limited by various tests of the background models using data .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ bclt_sum ] along with the cdf run i measurement and a weighted average of @xmath40 the average result is in good agreement with predictions from nrqcd and provides already constraining information for theoretical predictions .",

    "the choice of the exclusive mode allows for the first measurements of the @xmath51 mass from fits of a fully reconstructed mass peak . both analysis",

    "d0 measures the mass as  @xcite @xmath54 the measurement are in agreement with each other , while the cdf result may suggest refinements to the calculation of the mass using lqcd .",
    "the @xmath55 meson , the ground state meson consisting of @xmath12 and @xmath56 valence quarks , exhibits the behaviour of particle / antiparticle virtual transitions ( mixing ) which is seen in flavored neutral mesons . as a result of the mixing , the system has two mass eigenstates , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , each with its own lifetime .",
    "measurements of the @xmath55 lifetime either differentiate the mass eigenstates and measure their lifetimes separately or measure a combination of the two lifetimes .",
    "one can define the average lifetime and lifetime difference as @xmath59 for flavor specific measurements , where the flavor of the @xmath55 is determined by the final state particles , the mass eigenstates are not separately measured and the measured lifetime is  @xcite @xmath60    the theoretical estimates of lifetimes for ground state @xmath0 mesons containing a light quark can be evaluated in the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) .",
    "results are particularly precise for lifetimes ratios , where many theoretical uncertainties cancel .",
    "the predicted lifetime ratio @xmath61  @xcite shows a @xmath62 difference from the world average measured value of @xmath63  @xcite as of march 2007 .",
    "the lifetime results in the following sections will greatly improve the world average and decide whether this discrepency is significant .",
    "cdf measures the lifetime of the @xmath6 in the flavor specific mode @xmath65 , which includes the fully reconstructed @xmath66 and partially reconstructed @xmath67 and @xmath68 final states .",
    "the partially reconstructed modes increase the statistics , improving the precisions , but require a k factor from a simulation of partially reconstructed states that models the missing momentum in those decay modes .",
    "the mass models for the decay modes are also determined with simulated events .",
    "the lifetime fit takes place in two steps : the mass distribution is fitted to constrain the fractions of the fully and partially reconstructed decay modes , and the fractions are propagated into the lifetime fit .",
    "the measured lifetime is the most precise flavor specific measurement to date  @xcite : @xmath69 fig .",
    "[ bs_fs_sum ] , which summarises measurements of the @xmath70 lifetime in flavor specific modes , shows that this measurement has equal precision to the previous world average and will raise the average considerably .",
    "the average @xmath73 lifetime and @xmath71 is measured using the decays @xmath74 , where the heavy and light eigenstates can be identified .",
    "since the heavy and light eigenstates are cp odd and even respectively if one neglects the small expected cp violation of these decays , cp of the decay products determines the mass eigenstate . in the decay of the pseudoscalar @xmath6 to the vectors @xmath24 and @xmath75 , the cp of the final states is determined by the orbital angular configuration of the @xmath24 and @xmath75 ; cp odd for p wave and cp even for s and d wave .",
    "both cdf and d0 measure the lifetime and @xmath71 using @xmath76 @xmath49 and @xmath19 @xmath49 respectively . in the cdf measurement",
    "the cp violating phase @xmath77 is fixed to 0 while d0 allows it to float .",
    "the angular component of the fit is carried out using the transversity basis  @xcite and measures the mass eigenstate contributions .",
    "[ bs_jpsiphi ] shows the lifetime projections for the d0 and cdf fits .",

    "until recently , direct observation of baryons containing a @xmath12 quark have been limited to the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) baryon .",
    "the quark model predicts a charged baryon @xmath83 that is the @xmath86 bound state . as an analog to @xmath87 decays one will expect the @xmath83 to decay to a @xmath24 and the doubly strange @xmath88 .",
    "cdf and d0 searched for the @xmath89 decay chain ( see fig .",
    "[ xi_top ] ) and measured the mass and relative production cross section of @xmath83 .        the selection of @xmath11 events is driven by the relative large decay lengths of the of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 decay products , which are on the order of centimeters .",
    "for the d0 measurement which uses 1.3 @xmath49 of data , large decay lengths are used by only selecting events where the @xmath91 decay products have significantly large impact parameters with respect to the @xmath11 decay point . in the cdf analysis , the @xmath90 trajectory is reconstructed using hits in the silicon detectors , transforming a 5 track final state into a 3 track final state and reducing the backgrounds .",
