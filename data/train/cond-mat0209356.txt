    "it has been realized long ago that , alongside with the change in the behavior of the eigenfunctions , a localization - delocalization transition manifests itself in the statistics of the energy levels . in particular , as the energy is swept across the mobility edge , the shape of the level spacing distribution ( lsd ) crosses over from the wigner - dyson distribution , corresponding to the appropriate universality class , to the poisson distribution .",
    "moreover , finite - size corrections to the critical lsd exactly at the mobility edge allow to determine the value of the correlation length exponent,@xcite thus avoiding an actual analysis of the spatial extent of the wave functions .",
    "for this reason , the energy level statistics constitutes an alternative to the mackinnon - kramer@xcite and to the transmission - matrix@xcite approaches to the numerical study of localization .",
    "another reason why a large number of numerical simulations of the lsd at the transition @xcite were carried out during the past decade is the controversy that existed over the large - spacing tail of the critical lsd .",
    "conclusive demonstration@xcite that this tail is poissonian , i.e. , that there is no repulsion between the levels with spacings much larger than the mean value,@xcite rather than super - poissonian,@xcite implying that repulsion is partially preserved , required a very high accuracy of the simulations.@xcite the bulk of numerical work on the level statistics at the transition was carried out for three - dimensional systems @xcite for which there exists a mobility edge separating localized and extended states . in two dimensions",
    "all the states are localized in the absence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "localization - delocalization transitions in two dimensions ( quantum hall transitions ) are infinitely sharp . still the reasoning of ref",
    ".   applies .",
    "numerical studies have established a poissonian tail of the lsd.@xcite it was also demonstrated @xcite that the procedure of extracting the localization length exponent from the finite - size corrections yields a value close to @xmath4 found from large - size simulations of the wave functions.@xcite    recently , a semianalytical description of the integer quantum hall transition , based on the extension of the scaling ideas for the classical percolation @xcite to the chalker - coddington ( cc ) model of the quantum percolation,@xcite has been developed.@xcite the key idea of this description , a real - space - renormalization group approach ( rg ) , is the following .",
    "each rg step corresponds to a doubling of the system size .",
    "the rg transformation relates the conductance _",
    "distribution _ of the sample at the next step to the conductance distribution at the previous step .",
    "the _ fixed point _ of this transformation , yields the distribution of the conductance , @xmath0 of a _",
    "macroscopic _ sample at the quantum hall transition .",
    "this _ universal _",
    "distribution describes the mesoscopic properties of a fully coherent quantum hall sample .",
    "analogously to the classical percolation,@xcite the correlation length exponent , @xmath2 , was extracted from the rg procedure @xcite using the fact that a slight shift of the initial distribution with respect to the fixed - point , @xmath0 , drives the system to the insulator upon renormalization .",
    "then the rate of the shift of the distribution maximum determines the value of @xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , both @xmath5 and the critical exponent obtained within the rg approach@xcite agree very well with the `` exact '' results of the large - scale simulations.@xcite    the goal of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we extend the rg approach to the level statistics at the transition in order to subject its validity to yet another test . secondly",
    ", we apply the method analogous to the finite - size - corrections analysis to extract @xmath2 from the lsd obtained within the rg approach .",
    "this method yields @xmath6 , which is even closer to the most precise large - scale simulations result @xmath7 @xcite than the value @xmath8 inferred from the conductance distribution.@xcite the latter result is by no means trivial .",
    "indeed , the original rg transformation @xcite related the conductances , i.e. , the _ absolute values _ of the transmission coefficients of the original and the doubled samples , while the _ phases _ of the transmission coefficients were assumed random and uncorrelated . in contrast , the level statistics at the transition corresponds to the fixed point in the distribution of these phases . therefore , the success of the rg approach for conductances does not guarantee that it will be equally accurate _",
    "quantitatively _ for the level statistics .    within both rg transformations , for the magnitudes and for the phases of the transmission coefficients , an initial deviation from the critical",
    "distribution drives the system towards an insulator with zero transmission and poissonian lsd .",
    "thus the procedures of the extraction of @xmath2 from both transformations are technically different , but conceptually similar .",
    "in fact , the shape of the critical lsd , obtained from the rg approach , shows systematic deviations from the large - scale simulation results@xcite which yield the body of lsd very close to the gaussian unitary random matrix ensemble ( gue).@xcite however , the rg flow of the lsd towards the insulator appears to be robust .",

    "[ fig - rgstruct ] ) . within the rg approach to the conductance distribution , information about electron energy",
    "is incorporated only into the values of @xmath12 .",
    "the energy dependence of phases , @xmath16 , is irrelevant ; they are assumed completely random . due to this randomness , the transmission coefficients , @xmath12 , for a given energy , are also randomly distributed with a distribution function @xmath17",
    ". then the transformation ( [ eq - qhrg ] ) allows , upon averaging over @xmath16 , to generate the next - step distribution @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , within the rg scheme , a delocalized state corresponds to the fixed point , @xmath19 , of the rg transformation . due to the symmetry of the rg unit , it is obvious that the critical distribution , @xmath20 , of the power transmission coefficient , @xmath21 , which has the meaning of the two - terminal conductance , is symmetric with respect to @xmath22 . in other words ,",

    "the prime characteristics of the level statistics is the lsd  the distribution of the spacings between neighboring energy levels . in order to adjust the rg approach to the calculation of the lsd",
    ", it is necessary to `` close '' the sample at each rg step in order to discretize the energy levels .",
    "one of the possible variants of such a closing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rgstruct ] with dashed lines .    for a given closed rg unit with a fixed set of @xmath12-values at the nodes ,",
    "the positions of the energy levels are determined by the energy dependences , @xmath24 , of the four phases along the loops .",
    "these phases change by @xmath25 within a very narrow energy interval , inversely proportional to the sample size . within this interval",
    "the change of the transmission coefficients is negligibly small .",
    "a closed rg unit in fig .  [ fig - rgstruct ] contains @xmath26 links , and , thus , it is described by @xmath26 amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes are related by @xmath26 equations ( @xmath27 at each node ) .",
    "each link is characterized by an individual phase . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that the energy levels are determined only by the phases along the loops .",
    "one possible way to derive the system , in which individual phases combine into @xmath16 is to exclude from the original system of @xmath26 equations all amplitudes except the `` boundary '' amplitudes @xmath28 ( see fig.[fig - rgstruct ] ) .",
    "this procedure is similar to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq - qhrg ] ) .",
    "the system of equations for the remaining four amplitudes takes the form    @xmath29    where the parameter @xmath30 should be set zero .",
    "then the energy levels , @xmath31 , of the closed rg unit are the energies for which , with phases @xmath32 , one of the four eigenvalues of the matrix in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ system ] ) is equal to one . if we keep @xmath30 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ system ] ) , then the above condition can be reformulated as @xmath33 . thus , the calculation of the energy levels reduces to a diagonalization of the @xmath34 matrix .",
    "the crucial step now is the choice of the dependence @xmath24 . if each loop in fig .",
    "[ fig - rgstruct ] is viewed as a closed equipotential as it is the case for the first step of the rg procedure,@xcite then @xmath24 is a true magnetic phase , which changes linearly with energy with a slope governed by the actual potential profile , which , in turn , determines the drift velocity .",
    "thus we have @xmath35 where a random part , @xmath36 , is uniformly distributed within @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 is a random slope . strictly speaking",

    "@xmath39 , @xmath24 is a complicated function of @xmath40 which carries information about all energy scales at previous steps .",
    "however , in the spirit of the rg approach , we assume that @xmath24 can still be linearized within a relevant energy interval .",
    "the conventional rg approach suggests that different scales in the _ real _ space can be decoupled .",
    "linearization of eq .",
    "( [ eq - phie ] ) implies a similar decoupling in the _ energy _ space . in the case of phases ,",
    "a `` justification '' of such a decoupling is that at each following rg step , the relevant energy scale , that is the mean level spacing , reduces by a factor of @xmath41 .    with @xmath24 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - phie ] ) and fixed values of @xmath12 , the statistics of energy levels determined by the matrix equation ( [ system ] ) is obtained by averaging over the random initial phases @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , each realization of @xmath36 yields 3 level spacings which are then used to construct a smooth lsd .",

    "diagonalization of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ system ] ) with subsequent averaging over realizations yields the lsd , @xmath44 , at the second step .",

    "( [ eq - phie ] ) .",
    "this leads to the next - step lsd and so on .",
    "it is instructive to compare our procedure of calculating the energy levels with an approach adopted in large - scale simulations within the cc model.@xcite this approach is based on the unitary network operator @xmath45.@xcite for a single rg unit this operator acts analogously to the matrix in the left - hand side of eq.([system ] ) .",
    "however , within the approach of refs . and , the energy dependence of phases @xmath16 in the elements of the matrix was neglected ( only the random contributions , @xmath36 , were kept ) .",
