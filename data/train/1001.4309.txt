    "in research fields such as micro electro mechanical systems ( mems ) and bio - imaging , digital holographic microscopy ( dhm ) @xcite is attractive as a new microscopy technique , because the dhm allows both the amplitude and phase of a specimen to be simultaneously observed .",
    "the technique can obtain a hologram whereby the information of a specimen is electronically recorded , via the use of a charge - coupled device image sensor ( ccd ) . in order to obtain a reconstructed image from a hologram ,",
    "numerous calculations for the fresnel diffraction @xcite are required ; however , the fresnel diffraction has a restriction , namely , the same sampling spacings must be set on the hologram and the reconstructed image , or the sampling spacing on the reconstructed plane depends on the propagation distance and the wavelength of a reference light .",
    "therefore , we can not observe the reconstructed image with arbitrary resolution due to the restriction of the sampling spacing .",
    "in addition , in current dhm , an objective lens is used to increase the resolution of the reconstructed image ; however , using the objective lens sacrifices an area of the reconstructed image .    in this paper , without using an objective lens , we propose a dhm observable in multi - view and multi - resolution .",
    "the dhm can obtain multiple reconstructed images with arbitrary resolution , depths and positions , using shifted - fresnel diffraction @xcite , instead of fresnel diffraction .",
    "shifted - fresnel diffraction based on fresnel diffraction can calculate a reconstructed image with different sampling spacings between the hologram and the reconstructed image , as well as a shift away from the propagation axis .",
    "in addition , we used four graphics processing units ( gpu ) chips @xcite in order to observe four reconstructed images in real - time from one hologram .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the concept and the calculation method for the proposed dhm . in section 3",
    ", we describe the results of an optical experiment . in section 4 ,",
    "we conclude this work . in section 4",
    ", we conclude this work .",
    "the concept of the proposed dhm is shown in fig.1 . in the dhm , we can simultaneously observe reconstructed images at different depths ( fig.1 ( a ) and ( b ) ) along the depth direction .",
    "in addition , while observing a wide viewing area of a reconstructed image ( fig.1(c ) ) , we can simultaneously observe reconstructed images with the user - setting arbitrary resolutions at arbitrary positions ( fig.1 ( d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "an objective lens can increase the resolution of the reconstructed image , while decreasing the viewing area of the reconstructed image .",
    "for this reason , the proposed dhm system does not use an objective lens , instead , the proposed dhm system uses arbitrary sampling spacing on the reconstructed image .",
    "if we observe a wide viewing area of a reconstructed image , we set a large sampling spacing on the reconstructed plane .",
    "therefore in order to observe the reconstructed image in detail , we need to set a small sampling spacing on the reconstructed plane .    in order to realize the proposed dhm ,",
    "the following methods are required :    1 .   a computational method for obtaining reconstructed images with arbitrary resolution from a hologram 2 .   a high - speed computational system for reconstructing from a hologram in real - time .",
    "to solve these problems , we used shifted - fresnel diffraction and multi gpus .",
    "an outline of the dhm system is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the system consists of an optical system without using an objective lens , and a high - speed computational system using four gpu chips .",
    "some researchers have already used the gpu approach for real - time digital holographic reconstruction @xcite . in the figure",
    ", we used a 5-mw he - ne laser ( the wavelength is 632.8 nm ) as a reference light . ``",
    "nd '' indicates a neutral density filter .",
    "we used a ccd camera , which has a resolution of @xmath0 and a pixel pitch of @xmath1 . in the reconstruction calculation from a hologram captured by the ccd , we resize the hologram with @xmath2 grids in order to use fast fourier transform ( fft ) for the calculation .",
    "we also used three samples , which are usaf 1951 test target , the head of a mosquito and a fly .",
    "holograms captured by the ccd are recorded as in - line gabor hologram and are transferred to personal computer via the usb2.0 interface .",
    "then , four gpu chips calculate four reconstructed images from one hologram in real - time .",
    "recently , a new diffraction calculation , shifted - fresnel diffraction , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the method enables arbitrary sampling spacings to be set on a hologram and a reconstructed plane as well as a shift away from the propagation axis .",
    "other methods capable of changing sampling spacing have also been studied @xcite .",
    "we chose shifted - fresnel diffraction because one can do a shift away from the propagation axis .",
    "shifted - fresnel diffraction is expressed by the following equations :    @xmath3 & = & c_1 \\sum_{m_0 } \\sum_{n_0 } u_0'[m_0,n_0 ] h[m_1-m_0 , n_1-n_0]\\nonumber \\\\   & = & c_1 u_0'[m_1,n_1 ] * h[m_1 , n_1 ] \\nonumber \\\\   & = & c_1 { fft^{-1 } \\biggl [ { fft \\biggl[u_0'[m_1,n_1 ] \\biggl ] } { fft \\biggl[h[m_1 , n_1 ] \\biggl ] }   \\biggl ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath4    @xmath5 & = & u_0[m_0,n_0 ] \\exp(i \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda z}(x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2 ) )                  \\exp(-i 2 \\pi ( m_0 s_x ( - \\frac{n_x}{2 } + o_{x_1 } )   +   \\nonumber \\\\               & & n_0 s_y ( - \\frac{n_y}{2 } + o_{y_1 } ) ) )                   \\exp(- i \\pi ( s_x m_0 ^ 2 + s_y n_0 ^ 2 ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath6 & = & \\exp(i \\pi ( s_x(m_1-m_0)^2 + s_y(n_1-n_0)^2 ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the fft and the inverse fft , @xmath9 is @xmath10 , @xmath11is the wave length of the reference light , @xmath12 is the distance between the hologram and the reconstructed image , @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14$]are the discretized coordinates on the hologram and the reconstructed image , @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] are the hologram and the reconstructed image , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the sampling spacing on the hologram , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the sampling spacing on the reconstructed image , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the shift distances away from the propagation axis . and , we define @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . for more details , see ref.@xcite .",

    "recent gpus with many stream processors allow us to use highly parallel processors .",
    "the stream processor can operate 32-bit ( or 64-bit ) floating - point addition , multiplication , and multiply - add instructions .",
    "we have already reported a real - time dhm system based on the fresnel diffraction using a gpu @xcite .    in this paper , for the shifted - fresnel diffraction",
    ", we used the gpu - based wave optics ( gwo ) library @xcite .",
    "the library is a numerical calculation library for the diffraction calculations using a gpu .",
    "if optics engineers and researchers have no knowledge of gpu , the gwo library provides them with the gpu computation power easily .",
    "the current gwo library runs on microsoft windows xp and is provided as a dynamic link library ( dll ) .",
    "the library and a sample code can be downloaded from ref.@xcite .    as shown in eq.(1 ) , shifted - fresnel diffraction can accelerate the computational time using two ffts and one inverse fft ; however , recent central processing units ( cpus ) do not have sufficient computational power for real - time calculation .",
    "therefore , we use gpu instead of cpu .",
    "multiple reconstructions using multi - gpu is shown below :    1 .",
