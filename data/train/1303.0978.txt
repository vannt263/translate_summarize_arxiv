    "this argument fails if two ( or more ) photons are exchanged between lepton and nucleon .",
    "experimentally , a recent measurement of the single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) for a transversely polarized nucleon , denoted by @xmath1 , was performed by the hermes collaboration  @xcite , and again a result consistent with zero was found within an error of about @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , preliminary data taken from ( ongoing ) precision measurements of @xmath1 at jefferson lab seem to indicate a non - zero effect  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of the ssa @xmath1 in a partonic picture needs to deal with two distinctive and complementary physical situations : the exchange of two photons between the lepton and either ( i ) one _ single _ quark or ( ii ) two _ different _ quarks . the asymmetry has been studied in refs .",

    "it was found that this observable generically behaves like @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the nucleon mass , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 the 4-momentum transfer to the nucleon .",

    "this requires the introduction of typical hadronic matrix elements of certain partonic operators that encode non - trivial correlations of the transverse nucleon spin and the transverse partonic motion  @xcite , as well as multipartonic correlations  @xcite .",
