    "quantum codes in which quantum information is redundantly encoded in a collection of code carriers play an important role in quantum information , in particular in systems for error correction and in schemes for quantum communication @xcite .",
    "they are a generalization of the classical codes well known and widely used in everyday communication systems @xcite . while for the latter it is fairly obvious where the information is located , the quantum case is more complicated for two reasons .",
    "first , a quantum hilbert space with its non - commuting operators is a more complex mathematical structure than the strings of bits or other integers used in classical codes .",
    "second , the very concept of `` information '' is not easy to define in the quantum case .",
    "however , in certain cases one is able to make quite precise statements .",
    "thus in the five qubit code @xcite that encodes one qubit of information , none of the encoded information is present in any two qubits taken by themselves , whereas all the information can be recovered from any set of three qubits @xcite .",
    "similar precise statements can be made , as we shall see , in the case of an _ additive graph code _ on a collection of @xmath1 qudits which constitute the _ carriers _ of the code , provided each qudit has the same dimension @xmath0 , with @xmath0 some integer greater than one ( not necessarily prime ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that all additive graph codes are stabilizer codes , and in @xcite that all stabilizer codes are equivalent to graph codes for prime @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed discussion of non - binary quantum error correcting codes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the five qubit code just mentioned is an example of a quantum code that is locally equivalent to an additive graph code @xcite , and the information location has an `` all or nothing '' character . in general the situation is more interesting in that some subset of carriers may contain some but not all of the encoded information , and what is present can be either `` classical '' or `` quantum , '' or a mixture of the two . since many of the best codes currently known are additive graph codes , identifying the location of information could prove useful when utilizing codes for error correction , or designing new or better codes , or codes that correct some types of errors more efficiently than others @xcite .",
    "our formalism can also be applied to study quantum secret sharing schemes employing graph states and can even handle a more general setting where there might be subsets that contain partial information and hence are neither authorized ( contain the whole quantum secret ) nor unauthorized ( contain no information whatsoever about the secret ) .",
    "our approach to the problem of information location is algebraic , based upon the fact that generalized pauli operators on the hilbert space of the carriers form a group .",
    "subgroups of this group can be associated with different types of information , and the information available in some subset of the carriers can also be identified with , or is isomorphic to , an appropriate subgroup , as indicated in the isomorphism theorem of sec .  [ sct5 ] . in the process of deriving this theorem",
    "we go through a series of steps which amount to an _ encoding procedure _ that takes the initial quantum information and places it in the coding subspace of the carrier hilbert space .",
    "these steps can in turn be transformed into a set of quantum gates to produce an explicit circuit that carries out the encoding .",
    "this result , although somewhat subsidiary to our main aims , is itself not without interest , and is an alternative to a previous scheme @xcite limited to prime @xmath0 .",
    "there have been some previous studies of quantum channels using an algebraic approach similar to that employed here .",
    "those most closely related to our work are by bny et al .",
    "@xcite ( and see bny @xcite ) and blume - kohout et al.@xcite .",
    "these authors have provided a set of very general conditions under which an algebraic structure is preserved by a channel . in app .",
    "[ apdxd ] we show that our results fit within the framework of a `` correctable algebra '' as defined in @xcite . see also the remarks in sec .  [ sct7 ] .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some general comments about types of quantum information and their connection with certain ideal quantum channels are found in sec .",
    "section [ sct3 ] contains definitions of the pauli group and of some quantum gates used later in the paper .",
    "the formalism associated with additive graph codes as well as our encoding strategy is in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] ; this along with some results on partial traces leads to the fundamental isomorphism result in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] , which also indicates some of its consequences for the types of information discussed in sec .",

    "appendices  [ apdxa ] and [ apdxb ] contain longer proofs of theorems , app .",
    "[ apdxc ] presents an efficient linear algebra based algorithm for working out the results for any additive graph code , and app .",
    "[ apdxd ] illustrates the connection with related work in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both classical and quantum information theory have to do with statistical correlations between properties of two or more systems , or properties of a single system at two or more times . in the classical case information",
    "is always related to a possible set of physical properties that are distinct and mutually exclusive  e.g . , the voltage has one of a certain number of values  with one and only one of these properties realized in a particular system at a particular time . for quantum systems",
    "it is useful to distinguish different _ types _ or _ species _ of information @xcite , each corresponding to a collection of mutually distinct properties represented by a ( projective ) decomposition @xmath2 of the identity @xmath3 on the relevant hilbert space @xmath4 : @xmath5 any normal operator @xmath6 has a spectral representation of the form @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are its eigenvalues , and the decomposition @xmath9 is uniquely specified by requiring @xmath10 when @xmath11 .",
    "this means one can sensibly speak about the type of information @xmath12 _ associated with _ a normal operator @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 is hermitian this is the kind of information obtained by measuring @xmath6 .",
    "this terminology allows one to discuss the transmission of information through a quantum channel in the following way .",
    "let @xmath13 be the completely positive , trace preserving superoperator that maps the space of operators @xmath14 of the channel input onto the corresponding operator space @xmath15 of the channel output @xmath16 ( which may have a different dimension from @xmath4 ) .",
    "provided @xmath17 for all the operators @xmath9 associated with a decomposition @xmath18 of the @xmath4 identity , we shall say the channel is _ ideal _ or _ noiseless _ for the @xmath18 species of information , or , equivalently , the @xmath18 type of information is _ perfectly present _ in the channel output @xmath16 .",
    "formally , each physical property @xmath19 at the input corresponds in a one - to - one fashion to a unique property , the support of @xmath20 ( or the corresponding projector ) at the output .",
    "thus we have a quantum version of a noiseless classical channel , a device for transmitting symbols , in this case the label @xmath21 on @xmath19 , from the input to the output by associating distinct symbols with distinct physical properties  possibly a different collection of properties at the output than at the input .",
    "the opposite extreme from a noiseless channel is one in which @xmath20 is _ independent of @xmath21 _ up to a multiplicative constant . in this case",
    "no information of type @xmath18 is available at the channel output : the channel is _ blocked _ , or completely noisy ; equivalently , the @xmath18 species of information is _ absent _ from the channel output .",
    "hereafter we shall always use `` absent '' in the strong sense of `` completely absent '' , and the term _ present _ , or _",
    "partially present _ for situations in which some type of information is not ( completely ) absent but is also not perfectly present : i.e. , the channel is noisy but not completely blocked for this type of information .    in some cases all the projectors in @xmath9",
    "will be of rank 1 , onto pure states , but in other cases some or all of them may be of higher rank , in which case one may have a _ refinement _ @xmath22 of @xmath9 such that each projector @xmath19 is a sum of one or more projectors from the @xmath23 decomposition .",
    "it is then clear that if the @xmath23 information is absent / perfectly present from / in the channel output the same is true of the @xmath18 information , but the converse need not hold .",
    "thus it may be that the coarse grained @xmath18 information is perfectly present , but no additional information is available about the refinement .",
    "a particularly simple situation , which we will encounter later , is one in which the output @xmath16 is itself a tensor product , say @xmath24 , @xmath18 a decomposition of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 a decomposition of @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "it can then be the case that the information associated with the @xmath18 decomposition is perfectly present and that associated with the @xmath27 decomposition is ( perfectly ) absent from the channel output .",
    "suppose @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two types of quantum information defined on the same hilbert space .",
    "the species @xmath18 and @xmath27 are _ compatible _ if all the projectors in @xmath18 commute with all the projectors in @xmath27 , in which case the distinct nonzero projectors in the collection @xmath32 provide a common refinement of the type discussed above .",
    "otherwise , if some projectors in one collection do not commute with certain projectors in the other , @xmath18 and @xmath27 are _ incompatible _ and can not be combined with each other .",
    "this is an example of the single framework rule of consistent quantum reasoning , @xcite or ch .",
    "16 of @xcite .",
    "the same channel may be ideal for some @xmath18 and blocked for some @xmath27 , or noisy for both but with different amounts of noise . from a quantum perspective , classical information theory is only concerned with a single type of ( quantum ) information , or several compatible types which possess a common refinement , whereas the task of quantum , in contrast to classical , information theory is to analyze situations where multiple incompatible types need to be considered .",
    "the term `` classical information '' when used in a quantum context can be ambiguous or misleading .",
    "generally it is used when only a single type of information , corresponding to a single decomposition of the identity , suffices to describe what emerges from a channel , and other incompatible types can therefore be ignored .",
    "even in such cases it is helpful to indicate explicitly which decomposition of the identity is involved if that is not obvious from the context .",
    "the contrasting term `` quantum information '' can then refer to situations where two or more types of information corresponding to incompatible decompositions are involved , and again it is helpful to be explicit about what one has in mind if there is any danger of ambiguity .",
    "an _ ideal quantum channel _ is one in which there is an isometry @xmath33 from @xmath4 to @xmath16 such that @xmath34 for every operator @xmath35 on @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the superoperator @xmath13 preserves not only sums but also operator products : @xmath36 conversely , if holds for any pair of operators , one can show that the quantum channel is ideal @xcite , i.e. @xmath13 has the form . as the isometry maps orthogonal projectors to orthogonal projectors , will be satisfied for every species of information , and we shall say that _ all _ information is perfectly present at the channel output . the converse , that a channel which is ideal for all species , or even for an appropriately chosen pair of incompatible species is an ideal quantum channel , is also correct ; see @xcite .",
    "the preservation of operator products , , can be a very useful tool in checking for the presence or absence of various types of information in the channel output , as we shall see in sec .",
    "when holds for arbitrary @xmath35 and @xmath37 belonging to a particular decomposition of the identity , this suffices to show that the channel is ideal for this species .",
    "however , note that this sufficient condition is not necessary , since could hold without the @xmath38 being projectors , in which case @xmath39 is not mapped to @xmath40 .",
    "we use the term _ ideal classical channel _ for a type of information @xmath30 to refer to a situation where is satisfied and , in addition , @xmath41 where @xmath35 is any operator on the input hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "that is , not only is type @xmath18 perfectly transmitted , but all other types are `` truncated '' relative to this type , in the notation of @xcite .",
    "we generalize pauli operators to higher dimensional systems of arbitrary dimension @xmath0 in the following way .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 operators acting on a single qudit are defined as @xmath44 and satisfy @xmath45 where _",
    "the addition of integers is modulo @xmath0 _ , as will be assumed from now on . for a collection of @xmath1 qudits we use subscripts to identify the corresponding pauli operators : thus @xmath46 and @xmath47 operate on the space of qudit @xmath48 .",
    "the hilbert space of a single qudit is denoted by @xmath4 , and the hilbert space of @xmath1 qudits by @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "operators of the form @xmath50 will be referred to as _ pauli products _",
    ", where @xmath51 is an integer in @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath1-tuples in @xmath55 , the additive group of @xmath1-tuple integers mod @xmath0 . for a fixed @xmath1",
    "the collection of all possible pauli products form a group under operator multiplication , the _ pauli group _ @xmath56 . if @xmath57 is a pauli product , then @xmath58 is the identity operator on @xmath49 , and hence the order of any element of @xmath56 is either @xmath0 or else an integer that divides @xmath0 . while @xmath56 is not abelian , it has the property that two elements _ commute up to a phase _ : @xmath59 , with @xmath60 an integer in @xmath52 that depends on @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the collection of pauli products with @xmath63 , i.e. a pre - factor of @xmath64 , is denoted by @xmath65 and forms an orthonormal basis of @xmath66 , the hilbert space of linear operators on @xmath49 , with respect to the inner product @xmath67=\\delta_{q_1,q_2 } , \\quad \\forall q_1,q_2\\in { \\mathcal{q}}_n.\\ ] ] note that @xmath65 is a _ projective group _ or group up to phases .",
    "there is a bijective map between @xmath65 and the quotient group @xmath68 for @xmath69 where @xmath70 , the center of @xmath56 , consists of phases multiplying the identity operator on @xmath1 qudits .      in this subsection",
    "we define some one and two qudit gates generalizing various qubit gates .",
    "the qudit generalization of the hadamard gate is the _ fourier gate _ @xmath71 for an invertible integer @xmath72 ( i.e. integer for which there exists @xmath73 such that @xmath74 ) , we define a _ multiplicative gate _ @xmath75 where @xmath76 means multiplication mod @xmath0 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath77 be invertible ensures that @xmath78 is unitary ; for a qubit @xmath78 is just the identity .    for two distinct qudits @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "we define the cnot gate as @xmath81 the obvious generalization of the qubit controlled - not , where @xmath79 labels the control qudit and @xmath80 labels the target qudit .",
    "next the swap gate is defined as @xmath82 it is easy to check that swap gate is hermitian and does indeed swap qudits @xmath79 and @xmath80 . unlike the qubit case ,",
    "the qudit swap gate is not a product of three cnot gates , but can be expressed in terms of cnot gates and fourier gates as @xmath83 with @xmath84 finally we define the generalized controlled - phase or cp gate as @xmath85 the cp and cnot gates are related by a local fourier gate , similar to the qubit case @xmath86 since @xmath87 maps @xmath43 into @xmath42 under conjugation ( see table [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the gates @xmath87 , @xmath78 , swap , cnot and cp are unitary operators that map pauli operators to pauli operators under conjugation , as can be seen from tables  [ tbl1 ] and  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "they are elements of the so called _ clifford group _ on @xmath1 qudits @xcite , the group of @xmath1-qudit unitary operators that leaves @xmath56 invariant under conjugation , i.e. if @xmath88 is a clifford operator , then @xmath89 , @xmath90 . from tables",
    "[ tbl1 ] and  [ tbl2 ] one can easily deduce the result of conjugation by @xmath87 , @xmath78 , swap , cnot and cp on _ any _ pauli product .",

[ encoding](b ) for the case of a graph indicated in ( a ) in this figure .",
    "it is important to notice that both @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and therefore their product , are clifford operators , unitaries that under conjugacy map pauli products to pauli products .",
    "this follows from the fact that the gates in table  [ tbl3 ] are clifford gates , and will allow us in what follows to extend arguments that are relatively straightforward for trivial codes on trivial graphs to more general additive graph codes .",
    "in this section we define the _ information group _ that plays a central role in the isomorphism theorem in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] below .",
    "the basic strategy is most easily understood in terms of @xmath97 , the trivial code on the trivial graph . however , because the overall encoding map @xmath98 in is a clifford operation mapping pauli products to pauli products , various results that apply to @xmath99 can be immediately translated to the general graph code @xmath100 we are interested in , and for this reason most of the formulas valid for both are written in the form valid for @xmath101 even if the derivations are based on @xmath99 .",

    "first , pauli products belonging to @xmath110 can not contain @xmath111 operators , for such operators map each codeword onto an orthogonal state . on the other hand ,",
    "every @xmath112 leaves @xmath113 , , unchanged , so it belongs to @xmath110 if and only if it commutes with @xmath114 , which means @xmath115 must be a multiple of @xmath0 , or @xmath107 a multiple of @xmath104 , see .",
    "thus elements of @xmath110 commute with elements of @xmath116 , . since its operators can not alter the phases of the codewords , no additional factors of @xmath117 are allowed , and thus @xmath110 is given by .",
    "the stabilizer of the ( nontrivial ) code @xmath101 is then the isomorphic group @xmath118 obtained using the unitary @xmath98 of : @xmath119 a collection of pauli products because the unitary @xmath98 , as remarked earlier , is a clifford unitary .",
    "the order of @xmath110 , and thus of @xmath118 , is given by @xmath120    next define the subgroup @xmath121 of @xmath56 @xmath122 generated by operators belonging to the stabilizer @xmath123 of the graph state or to the coding group @xmath124 , and denote it by @xmath125 in the case of the trivial code .",
    "the elements of @xmath110 commute with those of @xmath126 ( both are abelian and the former is a subgroup of the latter ) , and also with those of @xmath116 , as noted above . as group properties are preserved under the @xmath98 map , as in , we conclude that all elements in @xmath118 commute with those in @xmath121 , even though @xmath121 is not ( in general ) abelian , and hence @xmath118 is a normal subgroup of @xmath121 . now define the _ abstract information group _ as the quotient group @xmath127 consisting of cosets of @xmath118 , written as @xmath128 or @xmath129 for @xmath130 in @xmath121 .",
    "note that because any element @xmath130 of @xmath121 is a pauli product , @xmath131 is the identity , and the order of @xmath130 is either @xmath0 or an integer that divides @xmath0 .",
    "consequently the order of any element of @xmath132 is also @xmath0 or an integer that divides @xmath0 .    to understand the significance of @xmath132",
    "consider a trivial code on a single qudit , with @xmath133 the elements of @xmath134 can be worked out using its identity @xmath135 and the generators @xmath136 and @xmath137 : @xmath138 it is evident that the cosets @xmath136 , @xmath139 and so forth up to @xmath140 are distinct , whereas @xmath141 .",
    "the same is true for powers of @xmath137 .",

    "the same argument extends easily to the trivial code on @xmath145 carriers produced by @xmath116 , see : @xmath134 is isomorphic to the group of pauli products on a set of qudits of dimension @xmath146 .",

    "the second and third equalities in reflect the fact that the product of the cosets @xmath118 and @xmath128 in either order is @xmath128 , which is to say @xmath153 forms the group identity of @xmath148 .",
    "they also tell us that the operators that make up @xmath148 act only on the coding space , mapping @xmath149 onto itself , and give zero when applied to any element of @xmath49 in the orthogonal complement of @xmath149 . because @xmath118 is a normal subgroup of @xmath121 , products of operators of the form mirror the products of the corresponding cosets , so the map from the abstract @xmath132 to the group @xmath148 is a homomorphism .",
    "that it is actually an isomorphism is a consequence of the following , proved in app .",

    "since the collection of pauli products @xmath65 with fixed phase forms a basis of @xmath66 , a collection of pauli products can be linearly _ dependent _ if and only if it contains both an operator and that operator multiplied by some phase .",
