    "the elliptic restricted three - body problem ( ertbp ) is a thoroughly investigated problem of celestial mechanics which has received continuing attention for a long time , due to its theoretical interest and practical applicability in the dynamics of planetary systems . in the ertbp",
    "a basic question is the stability of the lagrangian triangular equilibrium point @xmath0 .",
    "since the ertbp has two free parameters , the mass ratio @xmath1 and the orbital eccentricity @xmath2 of the primaries , and the linear variational equations of motion around @xmath0 , determining stability or instability , have periodic coefficients , the problem is more difficult than in the circular restricted three - body problem , with the only parameter @xmath1 and constant coefficients of the variational equations .",
    "floquet s theory @xcite of differential equations with periodic coefficients was used by @xcite to determine the boundaries of the stable domain of @xmath0 in the @xmath3 plane , and by @xcite to describe the structure of the unstable domain .",
    "@xcite derived an algebraic equation from which the four frequencies of libration around @xmath0 in the ertbp can be computed for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "transition curves , separating stable and unstable domains , were determined by analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite methods .",
    "non - linear stability of @xmath0 and the extension of the stable region around @xmath0 in the configuration plane , depending on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , were studied numerically by @xcite and also by @xcite who showed the shrinking of the stable region around @xmath0 at certain combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponding to unstable resonances .",
    "types of resonances between the frequencies of libration in the ertbp were defined in @xcite and their connection with the minima of the size of the stable region were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "applications to possible trojan exoplanets were investigated in @xcite .",
    "recently , by using hill s equation and the energy - rate method , @xcite pointed out the dominant role of the long - period component of libration in forming the structure of the stability domain of @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we study the resonances between the frequencies of motion around @xmath0 in the ertbp in a larger domain of the @xmath3 parameter plane than before @xcite , giving a more extended view on the relation between resonances and the structure of the stable and unstable domains of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the equations of motion are given and the applied methods are described in section [ sectionmethods ] .",
    "characteristic roots and characteristic exponents are discussed in section [ sectioncharrex ] .",
    "comparison of the frequencies obtained by floquet s theory and fast fourier transformation is made in section [ sectionfreqs ] , where fitting functions for the frequencies are also determined .",
    "resonances between the frequencies and their connection with the structure of the stable and unstable domains are studied in section [ sectionres ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ summary ] .",
    "the appendix gives the fitting functions and their coefficients for the frequencies .",
    "the ertbp studies the motion of a point - like body with negligible mass ( in the following a test particle ) , moving in the orbital plane and under the gravitational influence of two point - like massive bodies ( the primaries ) , which revolve around their barycentre in elliptic orbits .",
    "the equations of motion of the test particle , in a barycentric coordinate system , rotating together with the primaries with the @xmath4-axis going through them , are @xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the rectangular coordinates of the test particle , the prime means derivation according to the true anomaly @xmath7 of the primaries , serving as independent variable ,    @xmath8    and @xmath2 is the eccentricity of the relative orbit of the primaries .    the potential function @xmath9 is    @xmath10 + \\frac { 1-\\mu}{r_1}+\\frac { \\mu}{r_2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the mass parameter    @xmath11    @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the masses of the primaries , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the distances of the test particle from the primaries    @xmath16    the coordinates and distances are dimensionless , the instantaneous distance between the primaries serving as distance unit ( the equations of motion are written in the so - called rotating pulsating coordinate system ) .",
    "the ertbp depends on two parameters , the eccentricity @xmath17 , and the mass parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the equations of motion have five equilibrium solutions , the lagrangian points @xmath19 .",
    "the linear stability of these points can be studied by using the first variational equations of motion    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are infinitesimal displacements in the position and velocity coordinates of @xmath19 , and the partial derivatives of @xmath9 have to be computed at the points @xmath19 .",

    "[ def ] that for those values of @xmath1 and @xmath2    which correspond to the u2 domain , the d , e , and f resonances have the same character .",

    "moreover , these resonances are also equal to 1/a ( compare the a 3:1 and d , e , f 1:3 resonances in figs [ abc ] and [ def ] ) .    the resonance curves of the a , b , and d types in the s1 and s2 stability domains    are in good agreement with the results obtained in @xcite by using rabe s equation @xcite , and the a and e type resonances agree with those determined in @xcite by using the energy - rate method ( the e type resonance was computed in both the stable and unstable domains ) .",
    "we note that the c and f type resonance curves show peculiar shapes in the stable domain .",
    "this is in connection with the phenomenon that resonance curves do not behave regulary on the boundary of the stability region . crossing the boundary they break , making difficult to find a good fitting function .",
    "the most striking examples can be seen in the cases of the c and f type resonances in figs [ abc ] and [ def ] .    we know from stability investigations of the solar system that resonances can protect , but can also destroy systems of celestial bodies .",

    "[ resonancepeaks ] shows the changing of the escape time of the test particle depending on @xmath1 for @xmath139 and @xmath138 .",

    "there are also many multiple resonances , corresponding to different types at the same time ( like 9:10 , 7:11 referring to a , d , e , and f types ) .",
    "an interesting behaviour is that by changing the eccentricity , protective resonances can become destroying ones , decreasing the escape time of the test particle .",
    "for example , for @xmath139 the c 1:11 , e 1:21 , f 1:21 , and 4:5 resonances are protective , but for @xmath140 they are destroying to which there correspond pits in the escape time curve in fig .",
