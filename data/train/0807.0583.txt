    "the study of distances and metrics between quantum states is a topic of permanent interest , which has been lately rekindled on account of problems emerging in quantum information theory ( qit ) @xcite .",
    "distances are used as measure of distinguishability between quantum states @xcite and in the definition of the degree of entanglement @xcite , just to mention two very relevant examples .",
    "they also characterize the geometrical structure of the space of quantum states @xcite .    in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics",
    "the states of a physical system @xmath0 are represented by operators ( density operators ) acting on a hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely the states of the system @xmath0 are represented by the elements of @xmath2 , that is , the set of positive , trace - one operators on @xmath1 .",
    "the notion of a state as a unit vector of @xmath1 refers to the extremal elements of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is extremal if and only if it is idempotent , @xmath4 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath5 is of the form @xmath6 for some unit vector @xmath7 , and it is called a pure state . if @xmath5 is not idempotent , the corresponding state is called mixed .    in introducing distances between quantum states different roads have been traversed @xcite .",
    "for example wootters arrived at the distance @xmath8 by analyzing the statistical fluctuations in the outcomes of measurements into the quantum mechanics formalism @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ wootters ] ) , @xmath9 represents the inner product between the pure states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and therefore @xmath12 gives the  angle \" between these two states .    another way of dealing with the problem of introducing distances between quantum states is to generalize the notions of distance defined in the space of classical probability distributions .",
    "this is the case of the relative entropy , which is a generalization of information theoretic kullback ",
    "leibler divergence .",
    "the relative entropy of an operator @xmath5 with respect to an operator @xmath13 , both belonging to @xmath2 , is @xmath14 \\label{rel - ent}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 stands for logarithm in base two .",
    "the relative entropy is not a metric ( because it is not symmetric and does not verify the triangle inequality ) .",
    "even worst , it may even be unbounded .",
    "in particular , the relative entropy is well defined only when the support of @xmath13 is equal to or larger than that of @xmath5 @xcite ( the support of an operator is the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of the operator with nonzero eigenvalues ) .",
    "this is a strong restriction which is violated in some physically relevant situations , as for example when @xmath13 is a pure reference state .",
    "recently we have investigated a distance between mixed quantum states that was named the quantum jensen ",
    "shannon divergence ( qjsd ) and that is a symmetrized version of relative entropy ( [ rel - ent ] ) : @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{js - relative - entropy}\\ ] ] the main properties of the qjsd as a distinguishability measure have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the metric character of the square root of @xmath17 has also been reported recently @xcite .",
    "it has several interesting interpretations into the realm of qit and it has been applied as a measure of the degree of entanglement @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose an alternative metric between quantum states , that we think , from a conceptual point of view , is a very natural one and which is , in some sense , a derivative of the qjsd .",
    "this proposal hinges on two central concepts of qit : entropy and purification .",
    "relevant properties of these notions are quoted in the following section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : pure ] we consider a measure of distance for pure states defined using von neumann entropy and we study its properties .",
    "section  [ sec : mixed ] is devoted to the new proposal of a distance between mixed states by recourse to the concept of purification .",
    "we then present in section  [ sec : applic ] an application for the case of 1-qubit mixed states with a numerical example . finally , concluding remarks are drawn in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "_ entropy _ is a fundamental notion in classical and in quantum information theory . in the classical case",
    "most of the results concerning the coding problem can be expressed in terms of the shannon entropy @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a ( discrete ) probability distribution @xcite . in the quantum context",
    "the expression for entropy differs from the shannon entropy . for a mixed state described by the density operator @xmath5",
    ", von neumann defined the entropy of @xmath5 as @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the set of eigenvalues of the operator @xmath5 .",
    "the von neumann entropy has several interesting properties @xcite . among them",
    "we remark the one that gives an upper bound for a convex combination @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 equality is verified if and only if the states @xmath25 have supports in orthogonal subspaces .",
    "although expressions ( [ shannon ] ) and ( [ vneu ] ) look similar , they are quite different .",
    "these differences are particularly relevant for quantum information theory .",
    "for example , if @xmath26 is a message taken from the source @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the probability of the message @xmath26 , the shannon entropy of the source is @xmath29=-\\sum_a p(a ) \\log_2 p(a ) .\\ ] ] let us now suppose that we have a quantum signal source , that is a device that codes a message @xmath26 taken from the source @xmath27 into a signal state @xmath30 of a quantum system @xmath0 .",
    "the ensemble of signals from the signal source will be represented by the density operator @xmath31 then , if the signal states @xmath30 are not orthogonal and from ( [ ineqvn ] ) , the inequality @xmath32 is satisfied .",
    "the physical consequences of this inequality have been analyzed in detail by jozsa and schlienz @xcite .",
    "another important property of von neumann entropy is that it gives the number of qubits necessary to represent a quantum signal faithfully .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that alice has a source of pure qubit signal states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "each emission is chosen to be @xmath10 or @xmath11 with an equal prior probability one half .",
    "then in this case the density matrix of the source is @xmath33 .",
    "alice may communicate the sequence of states to bob by transmitting one qubit per emitted state .",
    "but , according to the quantum source coding theorem , the quantity @xmath34 gives the lowest number of qubits per state that alice needs to communicate the quantum information ( with arbitrarily high fidelity ) @xcite .",
    "_ purification _ is the second key concept we use in proposing a metric for quantum states .",
    "it has to do with the fact that every mixed quantum state can be interpreted as being part of a higher - dimensional pure state . from a physical point of view",
    "the notion of purification provides , for example , insight into the mechanism of quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "formally it can be described in the following way : let @xmath5 be any mixed state on the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "a purification of @xmath5 is any pure state @xmath10 in any extended hilbert space @xmath35 with the property that @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the partial trace on the hilbert space @xmath38 . in other words",
    "a purification is any pure state having @xmath5 as the reduced state for subsystem @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 admits the decomposition @xmath39 , an example for a purification of @xmath5 is given by @xmath40 with the auxiliary states @xmath41 being mutually orthogonal .",
    "we complete this section by remarking two facts on purifications that will be used later on :    1 .",
    "it can be shown that for two purifications @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the state @xmath5 , there exists a unitary transformation @xmath44 acting on @xmath38 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the identity operator on the space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "2 .   if one is interested in purifications of two states it can be assumed , without loss of generality , that the purifications lie in the same extended hilbert space @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be two pure states in a given hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "we define the distance between these two states in the form : @xmath47 it should be noted that this expression corresponds to the square root of the qjsd when evaluated between pure states .",
    "indeed , in terms of the von neumann entropy ( [ vneu ] ) , the qjsd ( [ js - relative - entropy ] ) can be rewritten in the form : @xmath48 but for a pure state the von neumann entropy vanishes ; then for the corresponding operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 it results : @xmath51    after some algebra , we can rewrite the square of eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) , in terms of the inner product between @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 the main properties of @xmath54 given by eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) are :    * it is symmetric . *",
    "it vanishes if and only if @xmath55  ( this can be easily verified from inequality  ( [ ineqvn ] ) and from the fact that the von neumann entropy vanishes for a pure state ) . * it verifies the triangle inequality  ( but @xmath56 the metric character .",
    "the distance @xmath57 between two neighboring pure states @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 in an orthonormal basis , is given by : @xmath61    from expression  ( [ wootters ] ) it is easily checked that , up to second order in @xmath62 , the following relation exists between wootters distance and the distance @xmath57 given in ( [ pure ] ) : @xmath63    a similar relation is also true for the fubini ",
    "study metric @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have thought the square root of the von neumann entropy of the average @xmath64 as a true metric between two pure states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "here we investigate its extension to mixed states .",
    "we start by recalling that the bures distance between two mixed states , that is for two operators @xmath5 and @xmath13 belonging to @xmath2 , is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fidelity function ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "a well - known result ( uhlmann s theorem @xcite ) asserts that the fidelity @xmath67 can be expressed in the form @xmath68 where the maximization is performed over all purifications @xmath10 of @xmath5 and all purifications @xmath11 of @xmath13 .",
    "then , the bures metric can be rewritten in the form : @xmath69 where the minimum is taken over all purifications of @xmath5 and @xmath13 .    by mimicking this last expression",
    ", we can define from eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) , a metric for arbitrary mixed states @xmath5 and @xmath13 belonging to @xmath2 : latexmath:[\\[d_n(\\rho,\\sigma ) \\equiv \\min_{|\\psi\\rangle,|\\varphi\\rangle } \\sqrt{h_n \\left ( \\frac{|\\psi\\rangle \\langle \\psi| +    again , the minimum is taken over all purifications @xmath10 of @xmath5 and all purifications @xmath11 of @xmath13 .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ entro2 ] ) and due to the decreasing nature of @xmath71 as a function of @xmath72 $ ] , eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , to seek the minimum out in our proposal  ( [ new ] ) is equivalent to look for the purifications that maximize the overlap @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , by construction , the metric character of @xmath74 is kept for mixed states .",
    "it also is always well defined .    from a conceptual point of view , our proposal is equivalent to replace the problem of measuring the distance between two arbitrary mixed states , @xmath5 and @xmath13 , by the problem of distinguishability of all the ensembles @xmath75 built from purifications of @xmath5 and @xmath13 respectively @xcite .",
    "this is the central point in our proposal .    according to identity  ( [ jozsa ] ) ,",
    "the metric @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of the fidelity in the form : @xmath77 by using this representation , we can derive the main properties of the metric @xmath76 . for example    * @xmath57 is invariant under unitary transformations : @xmath78 . * if @xmath79 is a trace - preserving quantum operation , then : @xmath80 .    as a textbook exercise we can derive an alternative expression for fidelity @xcite :",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath10 is any _ fixed _ purification of @xmath5 , and the maximization is performed over all purifications @xmath11 of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , by using this expression and eq .",
    "( [ alter2 ] ) , the new metric  ( [ new ] ) can be reexpressed in a more convenient way : @xmath82 where @xmath10 is any fixed purification of @xmath5 , and the minimization is taken over all purifications @xmath11 of @xmath13 .",
    "several interesting questions arise from the definition of distance between quantum states given by eq .",
    "( [ new ] ) . among them",
    "we remark the following two :    * the first one has to do with the computability of @xmath76 .",
    "as it was said , the purifications of @xmath5 and @xmath13 can be thought as belonging to the same extended hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , according to eq .",
    "( [ unitary ] ) , every purification is related to another one by a unitary transformation .",
    "therefore the technical task of finding the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ new1 ] ) is equivalent to finding unitary operations acting on the auxiliary hilbert space that maximize the overlap @xmath73 .",
    "this point will be analyzed , for a particular example , in the next section . *",
    "the second point to be remarked is the relevance of the metric @xmath76 to the light of decoherence .",
    "decoherence can be viewed as the unitary evolution of a compound system consisting of the system itself and its environment , under which both components become entangled @xcite . in this context",
    ", the auxiliary space @xmath38 corresponds to the environment .",
    "as an illustrative application , we now evaluate the metric @xmath57 given in eq .",
    "( [ new ] ) , for two 1-qubit states . in this case",
    "it is convenient to use the bloch representation for a mixed 1-qubit state : @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the @xmath85 identity matrix , the bloch vector @xmath86 is a 3-dimensional vector such that @xmath87 , and the vector @xmath88 has as components the pauli matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 belongs to the complex plane @xmath89 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that a purification of an arbitrary density @xmath5 acting on @xmath90 ( that is , a @xmath91 matrix ) is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 ,  @xmath94 are the components of the vector @xmath86 , @xmath95 are the components of the vector @xmath96 , and the @xmath97 real matrix @xmath98 is a solution of the system of equations : @xmath99 the result by constantinescu _",
    "@xcite establishes further that all purification of @xmath5 is of the form ( [ purif ] ) with matrix @xmath100 , with @xmath101 being an element of the lie group @xmath102 and @xmath103 a particular solution of the system ( [ system ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case the evaluation of the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ new1 ] ) to obtain @xmath57 leads to an extremization problem over the parameter space of the lie group @xmath102 .    as a particular example , let us show how to find this minimum by evaluating the distance @xmath104 between an input state @xmath5 and the state emerging from a depolarizing channel @xmath105 the depolarizing channel can be viewed as a process that takes a system to a fully mixed state with probability @xmath106 , or leaves it unchanged with probability @xmath107 .",
    "the effect of the depolarizing channel ( [ depolarizing ] ) over the state @xmath5 is to `` contract '' the vector @xmath86 in the factor @xmath108 : @xmath109 .",
    "a strategy for evaluating the metric @xmath110 could be established in the following way : let @xmath98 be a solution of the system ( [ system ] ) corresponding to a bloch vector @xmath86 , and let @xmath111 be the solution of ( [ system ] ) corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath113 where @xmath114  and  @xmath115 .",
    "now we take a fixed purification of @xmath5 characterized by the matrix @xmath98 ( solution of ( [ system ] ) ) and evaluate a matrix @xmath116 that satisfies ( [ op2 ] ) ( associated with purification @xmath117 ) .",
    "then every purification of @xmath118 can be expressed in the form @xmath119 with @xmath101 being an element of @xmath102 . thus to find @xmath120 that minimizes our proposal  ( [ new1 ] ) , is equivalent to find @xmath121 such that minimizes the norm @xmath122 @xcite .",
