    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the great wonders of universe .",
    "they combine several of the hottest topics of 21@xmath0 century astrophysics .",
    "on one side they are privileged laboratories for fundamental physics , including relativistic physics , acceleration processes and radiation mechanisms . on the other side , being grbs associated to the death of massive stars",
    ", they can be used as cosmological tools to investigate star - formation and metal enrichment at the epochs of galaxy birth , formation and growth .",
    "there are two main research areas to the latter purpose .",
    "the first one uses the grb as a background beacon for spectroscopy of uv lines , to characterize the physical and chemical status of the matter along the line of sight .",
    "the second includes statistical studies of the grb redshift distributions @xcite to infer information on the histories of the grb- and star- formation rates and of the metal enrichment in the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the techniques adopted , and therefore the reference communities , are somewhat different , these research areas are interconnected . as an example , on one hand spectroscopy of uv lines can be used to determine the metal content of the absorption systems . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that galaxy scale properties like metalicity , star - formation rate and mass are correlated .",
    "then , metalicity determinations obtained through grb spectroscopy could be , at least in principle , plugged in the grb population studies , to obtain a better constraint on the models .",
    "unfortunately , both research areas are plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "\\(1 ) absorption line spectroscopy is certainly a powerful tool .",
    "spectroscopy of galaxies and qsos is routinely used to study both the galaxy inter - stellar - matter ( ism ) and the inter - galactic - matter ( igm ) along the line of sight",
    ". however , star - formation regions and the ism in general , are highly complex systems .",
    "it is then not clear whether single lines of sight can provide information truly representative of such systems as a whole .",
    "\\(2 ) population studies are also very powerful tools .",
    "galaxy and agn counts and luminosity functions have been used to successfully measure the evolution of the star - formation rate , of the galaxy and black hole mass densities up to z=3 - 4 and beyond .",
    "thanks to first bepposax and then to hete2 and swift we start to have sizable samples of reliable grb redshifts ( about 70 up to now ) , and a similar number will likely be produced by swift in the next few years .",
    "this opens up the possibility to compute relatively well constrained grb luminosity functions in a few redshift bins , and therefore measure the cosmic evolution of the grb rate .",
    "however , the fraction of swift grbs with a reliable redshift is today about one third of the total .",
    "it is expected that this fraction will improve in future , but it will hardly approach to the majority of the grbs .",
    "this means that the biggest problem we have to face to use grbs as cosmological tools is to understand and account for large selection effects .    in the next sections we address the second problems while the first is discussed in a companion paper @xcite",
    "the importance of large selection effects shaping the population of grbs with a measured redshift is evident when comparing the redshift distribution of swift grbs with that of bepposax and hete2 grbs ( figure [ zdist ] ) .",
    "the median redshifts of the two distributions are 2.6 and 1.5 respectively .",
    "this discrepancy can not be simply explained as due to a different detector sensitivity ( guetta & piran in preparation ) . to gain more information on this issue",
    "we study three well defined sample of grbs detected by these three satellites .",
    "we select grbs outside the galactic plane , to limit galactic extinction along their line of sight and to avoid fields too crowded , which can complicate the discovery of optical / nir afterglows , so hampering redshift determinations . to this purpose",
    "we limit our study to regions with galactic column density along the line of sight @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "we also select grbs with good ( arcmin ) localization . for bepposax and hete2 grbs",
    "we require that the @xmath3ray burst is detected by the high energy grbm and fregate instruments and is localized by the wfc , wxc or sxc instruments . for swift",
    "we consider all grbs up to september 10 2006 .",
    "we consider only reliable spectroscopic redshift .",
    "table 1 gives more information on the selected samples .",
    ".grb samples : the ones with optical afterglows ( o.a ) , the ones with optical afterglow temporal decay index ( o.decay ) , the total number of grbs with z and the ones with z derived from the host galaxy [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to understand how the different selection effects ( peak - flux limit , x - ray obscuration and magnitude of the optical afterglow ) can modify the redshift distribution we extracted from the swift grb sample a subsample having the same peak - flux , n@xmath4 and rmag(@10ksec ) distributions of the joined bepposax+hete2 samples ( the simulated redshift distribution hereafter ) .",
    "figure 5 compares the redshift distrubution of this subsample with the full swift and bepposax+hete2 grbs . to evaluate the uncertainty on the simulated redshift distribution we ran the random extraction 100 times .",
    "we see that the average simulated redshift distribution is consistent , within the statistical uncertainties , with the real bepposax+hete2 redshift distribution at all redshifts but z=1.5 - 2 . in particular , the shallower peak - flux limit and brighter magnitudes of the optical afterglow of the bepposax+hete2 grbs",
    "explain why only few high redshift grbs are found in this sample .",
    "on the other hand , the smaller number of low - z grbs can be explained by the lower absorbing column densities of the bepposax grbs .",
    "it remains to understand the deficit of z=1.5 - 2 grbs in the bepposax+hete2 sample .",
    "this can hardly be explained by the three quantities considered in our analysis .",
    "a possible explanation for this deficit can be related to the lack of strong absorption features in the 3800 - 8000   range covered by optical spectrometers for this redshift interval , coupled with worse quality spectroscopy available at least at the time of the bepposax measurements .",
    "in fact , the lyman@xmath5 enters the above range only at z@xmath6 , while the mgii doublet goes in a region strongly affected by telluric features at z@xmath7 .",
    "it is however difficult to make more quantitative this issue .    in conclusion , in order to safely use grbs as cosmological tools and derive their redshift evolution from statistical analysis of the present grb samples selection effects on grb detection , grb localization and grb redshift determination",
    "must be taken into account properly ( guetta et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "and rmag(@10ksec ) distributions of the joined bepposax+hete2 samples ( thin solid line ) compared with the swift ( thick solid line ) and bepposax+hete2 ( dashed line ) total redshift distributions .",
    "the dotted lines mark the redshift range covered by 100 random extractions and can give an idea of the statistical uncertainty associated to a single extraction of a redshift distribution of 25 grbs from a parent population . ]"
