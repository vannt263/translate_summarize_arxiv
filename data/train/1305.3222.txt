    "the usual measure to assess how well a quantum device implements a desired quantum operation is the average fidelity , @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the desired unitary and the actual time evolution is described by the dynamical map @xmath2 .",
    "the standard approach to determine @xmath3 relies on quantum process tomography  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the average fidelity of a quantum process in a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space is often estimated by performing quantum state tomography in a @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space . for @xmath6 qubits @xmath7 .",
    "the fidelity can also be obtained by determining the process matrix which is of size @xmath8 . in both cases",
    "quantum process tomography scales exponentially in resources  @xcite . for quantum devices to be realized and tested in practical applications , a less resource - intensive approach to characterization is required .",
    "recent attempts at reducing the required resources employ stochastic sampling of the input states and measurement observables  @xcite .",
    "the process matrix can be estimated efficiently if it is sparse in a known basis  @xcite . for general unitary operations and without assuming any prior knowledge , monte carlo sampling to determine state fidelities in the @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space currently seems to be the most efficient approach  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the approach directly targets the fidelity between the desired operation and the implemented process rather than fully characterizing the process and subsequently comparing it to the desired operation .",
    "it also comes with the advantage of separable input states and local measurements . for @xmath6 qubits",
    ", this approach requires the ability to prepare @xmath9 input states since there are 6 eigenstates for the three pauli operators for each qubit and the ability to measure all of the @xmath10 operators that form an orthonormal hermitian operator basis .",
    "another approach to the estimation of the average fidelity exploits its property of being a second - degree polynomial in the states , utilizing a so - called two - design  @xcite .",
    "a commonly used two - design is made up of the @xmath11 states of @xmath12 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "the average fidelity is then written as a sum over state fidelities for these states  @xcite .",
    "the latter implies preparation of entangled input states since only three out of the @xmath12 mutually unbiased bases consist of separable states  @xcite . both monte carlo characterization and the two - design approach yield the average fidelity with an arbitrary , prespecified accuracy .",
    "alternatively , bounds on the average fidelity can be obtained from two classical fidelities  @xcite where each classical fidelity is expressed as a sum over @xmath4 state fidelities .",
    "the different requirements of monte carlo characterization , the two - design approach and the two classical fidelities in terms of the number of input states raise the question of what is the minimal set of states to determine @xmath3 .    here",
    "we show that a minimal set of states can be identified by the requirements to allow for distinguishing any two unitaries and assess whether the time evolution is unitary .",
    "we find the minimal set of states to consist of only two states , independent of the size of hilbert space .",
    "the minimal set contains , however , a totally mixed thermal state which is impractical for experiments .",
    "we therefore also introduce a reduced sets of states that consist of the minimum number of pure states required to distinguish any two unitaries and assess whether the time evolution is unitary .",
    "the average fidelity can then be estimated by evaluating a distance measure for the reduced set of states .",
    "the corresponding protocol consists of preparing @xmath12 pure states , defined in @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space , and measuring the corresponding state fidelities .",
    "we show numerically that the estimate of the gate error differs from @xmath3 by less than a factor 2.5 in the worst case and on average by a factor 1.2 .",
    "we furthermore demonstrate that evaluation of state fidelities for the reduced set of states is also sufficient to quantify the non - unitarity of the process .",
    "this allows to determine whether the gate error is due to decoherence or due to unitary errors that are easier to mitigate .",
    "if analytical instead of numerical bounds on the average fidelity are desired , the reduced set needs to contain @xmath13 states , i.e. , our approach generalizes the estimate of the average fidelity in terms of two classical fidelities  @xcite .",
    "we show that the specific states utilized by refs .",
    "@xcite also fulfill the requirements for distinguishing any two unitaries and assessing unitarity of the time evolution  as do the states of any two mutually unbiased bases .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : the algebraic framework for identifying the minimum requirements to distinguish any two unitaries and assess unitarity of the time evolution is derived in section  [ sec : algframe ] , introducing the concepts of commutant space and total rotation .",
    "section  [ sec : redset ] presents the reduced sets of states and discusses their use for extracting an estimate of the average fidelity .",
    "the relationship of our approach to the two classical fidelities of ref .",
    "@xcite is established in section  [ sec : hofmann ] , and our results are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "detailed proofs of the claims made in section  [ sec : algframe ] are provided in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "to identify the reduced set of states , we introduce the concepts of commutant space of a set of density operators and total rotation .",
    "we assume purely coherent time evolution with an unknown unitary @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 , and generalize later to non - unitary time evolution .",
    "since the evolution is insensitive to a global phase , @xmath16 is an element of the projective unitary group , @xmath17 , i.e. , the quotient @xmath18 of the unitary groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 . given a set of states , @xmath21 , we consider the map @xmath22 , mapping the unitary @xmath16 onto the set of time - evolved states , @xmath23 .",
    "we can differentiate any two unitaries @xmath16 , @xmath24 if and only if the map @xmath25 is injective .",
    "we show that @xmath26 is injective if the commutant space of the set @xmath27 has only one element , the identity .",
    "we define the commutant space @xmath28 of a single density operator @xmath29 as the set of all linear operators in @xmath17 that commute with @xmath29 .",
    "it contains the identity and all operators that have a common eigenbasis with @xmath29 .",
    "unitaries @xmath30 in the commutant space of @xmath29 can not be distinguished from @xmath31 by time - evolving @xmath29 since @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , to distinguish a unitary @xmath16 from the identity , the time evolution of at least two density operators with different eigenbases is required .",
    "once we can differentiate an arbitrary unitary from the identity , we can differentiate it from any other unitary ( and @xmath25 is injective ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath17 is a group .",
    "we define the commutant space of a set of density operators , @xmath33 , as the intersection of all @xmath34 , i.e. , the set of all linear operators that commute with _ each _ @xmath35 .",
    "suppose the identity is the only element of the commutant space @xmath33 .",
    "then the identity is the only time evolution that leaves _ all _ @xmath35 unchanged and we can distinguish the identity from all other time evolutions by inspecting the time - evolved states .",
    "the detailed proof that injectivity of @xmath25 is equivalent to @xmath33 having identity as its only element is given in appendix  [ sec : app ] .    in order to determine the states of the reduced set @xmath27 that have a commutant space @xmath33 with identity as its only element , we introduce the concept of total rotation .",
    "unitary evolution corresponds to rotations in hilbert space . spanning the hilbert space by an arbitrary complete orthornomal basis @xmath36 ,",
    "a complete set of @xmath4 one - dimensional orthonormal projectors is obtained , @xmath37 .",
    "we construct density operators within this basis , for example by choosing a single state , @xmath38 with @xmath39 for @xmath40 , or a set of @xmath4 states , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . the time - evolved basis state @xmath44 or states @xmath45 allow for distinguishing all those unitaries from identity that do not have common eigenspaces with all @xmath46 .",
    "to distinguish the remaining unitaries from identity , we construct one additional state , @xmath47 , that is guaranteed to have no common eigenspace with any @xmath46 .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a totally rotated one - dimensional projector @xmath48 obeying @xmath49 @xmath50 and taking @xmath51 .",
    "adding @xmath48 to @xmath52 makes the set of projectors complete and totally rotating , @xmath53 .",
    "a set of states @xmath27 is complete and totally rotating if the subset of the projectors onto the one - dimensional eigenspaces of the @xmath27 is complete and totally rotating .",
    "for example , @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we show in appendix  [ sec : app ] that the identity is the only projective unitary operator that has a common eigenbasis with all elements of such a set of states .",
    "we have thus constructed a reduced set of states @xmath27 that allows for differentiating any two unitaries by inspection of the time - evolved states , @xmath56 . for coherent time evolution",

    "however , for a possibly incoherent time evolution , we need to quantify the non - unitarity of the actual evolutions @xmath62 .",
    "this can be done by checking whether @xmath2 maps projectors onto projectors , reflecting rotations in hilbert space .",
    "we show in appendix  [ sec : app ] that indeed unitarity of a dynamical map @xmath2 is equivalent to @xmath2 mapping ( i ) a set @xmath63 of @xmath4 one - dimensional orthogonal projectors onto another such set @xmath64 of @xmath4 one - dimensional orthogonal projectors and ( ii ) a projector @xmath48 that is totally rotated with respect to the set @xmath63 onto a one - dimensional projector .",
    "a set of density operators that allows for both differentiating any two unitaries and measuring the non - unitarity of any dynamical map @xmath2 is thus given by    [ eq : rho ] @xmath65    by construction , the states @xmath66 , @xmath47 are pure .",
    "they are separable if a separable basis is chosen , i.e. , if all @xmath67 are separable .",
    "another suitable reduced set to differentiate any two unitaries and measure non - unitarity of @xmath2 is given by @xmath68 this is the minimal set   to be unital . any distance measure based on @xmath69 must therefore contain an additional check whether @xmath2 maps the identity onto itself . which can be performed by adding a suitable third state to the set .",
    "however , for the characterization of quantum gates , it is preferable to use the pure input states defined in eq .  .",
    "each of these states , when evolved in time , is characterized , to leading order , by @xmath5 real parameters .",
    "knowledge of the total @xmath70 parameters is sufficient to determine whether the time evolution matches the desired unitary .",
    "note that both reduced sets are also sufficient to reconstruct a unitary that is close to a given open system evolution .",
    "this implies that , in optimal control calculations for quantum gates in the presence of decoherence , propagation of two states , @xmath69 independent of the system size @xmath4 , is sufficient .",
    "this reduces significantly the numerical effort compared to the @xmath5 states used to date  @xcite .",
    "the usual figure of merit in quantum process tomography , the average fidelity , @xmath3 , or , respectively , the gate error , @xmath71 , can be estimated by averaging over the distance measures @xmath61 , eq .",
    ", for each state @xmath35 in the reduced set .",
    "each @xmath61 becomes maximal if and only if @xmath72 . our protocol thus consists in the preparation of @xmath12 states @xmath35 , eq .  , and measurement of the corresponding state fidelities , @xmath61 , for the time - evolved states , @xmath62 .",
    "a possible choice of states is e.g. @xmath73 in the computational basis .",

    ". an optimized way to extract information from all the @xmath61 is obtained by a suitable combination of the arithmetic and geometric mean : we define a fidelity that switches from the arithmetic mean to the geometric one , should the state fidelities for all the @xmath66 be close to one ,    [ eq : fred ] @xmath78 with @xmath79    the choice of @xmath80 is motivated as follows : @xmath81 such that @xmath82 if @xmath83 for all @xmath84 , i.e. , in cases where the gate error is captured by @xmath85 alone ; and @xmath86 yielding @xmath87 if @xmath88 , i.e. , when the gate error is comprised in the @xmath89 .    , for 100.000 realizations when using @xmath90 , eq .  , ( left column ) and @xmath91 , eq .  , ( right column ) . shown are the results for randomized dynamical maps with @xmath92cnot ( a , b ) , truly random unitaries with @xmath92cnot ( c - d ) and randomized unitaries with @xmath93 ( e - f ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : histo](a ) shows the probability of obtaining a certain relative deviation of the estimated gate error for randomized dynamical maps and cnot as the target gate .",
    "the randomized dynamical maps were obtained by creating a random matrix  @xcite for twice as many qubits as there are system qubits .",
    "the random matrices were hermitized , multiplied by a randomly chosen scaling factor and exponentiated .",
    "the resulting matrix was multiplied by the tensor product of the target unitary with @xmath31 , and the bath qubits were traced out .",
    "for most dynamical maps , @xmath90 yields a good estimate of the gate error . if , however , the state fidelities for all @xmath66 are very high , but the fidelity for the totally rotated state is comparatively small , the arithmetic mean seriously underestimates the gate error .",
    "this can happen , for example , if the evolution is perfectly unitary , @xmath98 , and @xmath30 and the target @xmath1 have a common eigenbasis with all the @xmath66 . then the information relevant for the gate error is completely contained in @xmath85 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
