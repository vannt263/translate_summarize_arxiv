    "in this paper we study non - singular algebraic hypersurfaces in @xmath6 and other toric varieties .",
    "let @xmath3 be such a hypersurface .",
    "naturally , @xmath3 is a complex variety and thus has the underlying structure of a smooth manifold .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 is a symplectic manifold .",
    "the symplectic structure is induced by the embedding to @xmath6 .    since @xmath3 is non - singular",
    ", its diffeomorphism and symplectomorphism types depend only on its degree , i.e. the degree of the defining polynomial @xmath7 .",
    "all smooth hypersurfaces of the same degree are isotopic in the ambient @xmath6 even though the complex structure of @xmath3 varies with the coefficients of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , from the point of view of differential topology or symplectic topology a smooth projective hypersurface @xmath3 is given by two numbers : its dimension @xmath0 and its degree @xmath8 .",
    "given @xmath0 and @xmath8 , describe a non - singular hypersurface @xmath9 of degree @xmath8 as a smooth manifold and as a symplectic manifold .",
    "more generally , one can ask a similar question where @xmath6 is replaced by an arbitrary toric variety .",
    "the degree @xmath8 would then be replaced with a convex lattice polygon @xmath10 .",
    "the answer to this question is well - known if @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath3 is a riemann surface .",
    "topologically it is a sphere with @xmath12 handles , where the genus @xmath12 can be computed from the degree @xmath8 by the adjunction formula @xmath13 .",
    "recall that one way to understand riemann surfaces is via their decomposition to primitive pieces each diffeomorphic to a sphere with 3 holes .",
    "these primitive pieces are called _ pairs - of - pants _ and such a decomposition can be thought of as some ( singular ) fibration of the riemann surface over a 3-valent graph , see figure [ tripod ] .",
    "note that the first betti number of the base graph coincides with the genus of the riemann surface .      in this case",
    "@xmath3 is a smooth 4-manifold .",
    "if @xmath8 is 1 , 2 or 3 then @xmath3 is diffeomorphic to @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , the connected sum of @xmath15 and 6 copies of @xmath15 with the inverse orientation . in these cases",
    "the geometric genus @xmath18 vanishes .    if @xmath19 then @xmath20 and @xmath3 is the celebrated k3 surface ( named so , according to a. weil , in honor of khler , kodaira , kummer and the k2-mountain in pakistan ) .",
    "this manifold is primitive , it does not decompose as a connected sum .",
    "one way to understand its topology is via a singular fibration @xmath21 .",
    "a generic fiber of @xmath22 is a torus while 24 fibers are special and are homeomorphic to a torus with its meridian collapsed to a point ( so - called fishtail fibers ) .",
    "the fibration @xmath22 can be chosen so that all generic fibers are lagrangian submanifolds , i.e. so that the symplectic 2-form restricted to these fibers vanishes .",
    "for any value of @xmath8 @xmath3 is simply - connected and if @xmath23 it does not decompose into a connected sum .",
    "we have @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "e.g. a more general khovanskii s formula @xcite ) .",
    "a simply - connected smooth 4-manifolds is determined up to a homeomorphism once we know its euler characteristic @xmath25 , its signature @xmath26 and whether it is spin or not .",
    "our manifold @xmath3 is spin iff @xmath8 is even , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the diffeomorphism ( and symplectomorphism ) type of @xmath3 is , however , more mysterious as it is not determined by purely homological data .",
    "e.g. the surface of degree 5 is a non - spin manifold with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but there might be many non - diffeomorphic manifolds with these data .      in this case the canonical class of @xmath3 is trivial and there exists a nowhere - degenerate holomorphic n - form @xmath32 on @xmath3 .",
    "such @xmath3 is called a _",
    "calabi - yau _ manifold .",
    "here we have @xmath20 . according to the strominger - yau - zaslow conjecture",
    "@xcite there is supposed to exist a singular special lagrangian fibration of @xmath3 over the sphere @xmath5 .",
    "this means that a generic fiber should be lagrangian and such that the imaginary part of @xmath32 restricted to the fiber is zero as a real 3-form at every point .",
    "it was verified in @xcite and @xcite that such fibrations exist in this case at least if we relax a special lagrangian condition to simply lagrangian .",
    "note that special lagrangian condition makes use of the non - degenerate holomorphic @xmath0-form from a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "thus , at least literally , the strominger - yau - zaslow conjecture only makes sense if @xmath31 in our setup .",
    "however , a relaxed version of this conjecture makes sense for all values of @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "here we state the main results of the paper informally .",
    "see section [ mainres ] for precise statements .",
    "theorem [ diff ] asserts that for any value of @xmath0 and @xmath8 the hypersurface @xmath3 admits a singular fibration @xmath22 over an @xmath0-dimensional polyhedral complex @xmath33 .",
    "a generic fiber of @xmath22 is diffeomorphic to a smooth torus @xmath34 .",
    "the base @xmath33 here is homotopy equivalent to the bouquet of @xmath35 copies of @xmath5 , thus this theorem can be interpreted as a geometric interpretation of the geometric genus @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the local topological structure of the polyhedral complex @xmath36 is known in differential topology as the local structure of so - called _ special spines_. in particular , there is a natural stratification of @xmath37 and regular neighborhoods of the vertices essentially exhaust the complex @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that the stratification of the base @xmath37 determines a decomposition of the hypersurface @xmath3 into @xmath38 copies of @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is diffeomorphic to @xmath1 minus @xmath40 hyperplanes in general position .",
    "this decomposition can be considered as a higher - dimensional analogue of the pair - of - pants decomposition of riemann surfaces . in particular",
    "@xmath41 is the classical pair - of - pants @xmath42 .",
    "the base @xmath37 of the fibration @xmath22 is a piecewise - linear @xmath0-dimensional complex in @xmath43 .",
    "the dimension over @xmath44 of the hypersurface @xmath3 is @xmath45 . yet",
    "the hypersurface @xmath3 can be reconstructed ( as a smooth manifold ) from @xmath36 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath37 ( together with its pl - embedding to @xmath43 ) encodes the combinatorics of gluing of @xmath38 copies of @xmath39 needed to obtain @xmath3 .",
    "theorem [ locthm ] is the corresponding reconstruction theorem .",
    "it turns out that the fibration @xmath22 produces a number of lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath3 .",
    "different fibers of @xmath22 are not necessarily homologous and @xmath46 disjoint embedded lagrangian tori come as fibers of @xmath22 .",
    "this tori are linearly independent in @xmath47 .",
    "in addition we have @xmath48 linearly independent embedded lagrangian spheres coming as partial sections of @xmath22 .",
