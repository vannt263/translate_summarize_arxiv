    "meanwhile a spinful quantum system in the spin - incoherent regime @xcite also provides a new avenue for studying 1d quantum many - body systems .",
    "this regime is termed as spin - incoherent luttinger liquid ( sill ) which forms a different universality class from the luttinger liquid , where the temperature is high enough that different spin configurations can be regarded as degenerate while low enough that charge excitation is suppressed .  for 1d",

    "we investigate 1d spin-1 bose gas @xcite in the sill regime in a harmonic trap , which is studied only recently @xcite .",

    "tg spinor bose gas is a special case of sill since the exchange energy vanishes in this limit @xcite .",
    "therefore tg gas automatically is in the regime of sill .  in tg gas limit , we can write down the exact spatial wave functions since bosons are fermionized and impenetrable due to effectively infinitely - strong atom - atom interactions .  we then numerically calculate the momentum distributions for the three individual components of the spin-1 bose gas ( spin - plus , minus , and @xmath1 ) .",
    "these predictions can be measurable in spin - resolved matter - wave experiments , either the time - of - flight experiment @xcite or bragg scattering spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "as compared with electronic spin-@xmath10 systems @xcite , ultracold atom experiments not only provide controllable spatial dimensions but also tunable atom - atom interactions via feshbach resonances , thus making our investigations testable in the quantum many - body systems .     in ref .",

    "iii , we derive the general forms of density matrices for each spin components with individual spin function overlaps in sill regime , and present the numerically calculated results using monte carlo integration method implemented with gaussian unitary ensemble .  in sec .",
    "we discuss the analytical derivation of high momentum asymptotic for each component , which we compare with numerically calculated momentum distributions .",

    "<S> spin - incoherent luttinger liquid ( sill ) is a different universal class from the luttinger liquid .  </S>",
    "<S> this difference results from the spin incoherence of the system when the thermal energy of the system is higher than the spin excitation energy .  </S>",
    "<S> we consider one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 bose gas in the sill regime and investigate its spin - dependent many - body properties .  in tonks - girardeau limit , we are able to write down the general wave functions in a harmonic trap .  </S>",
    "<S> we numerically calculate the spin - dependent ( spin - plus , minus , and @xmath1 ) momentum distributions in the sector of zero magnetization which allows to demonstrate the most significant spin - incoherent feature compared to the spinless or spin - polarized case .  </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the spinless bose gas , the momentum distributions are broadened and in the large momentum limit follow the same asymptotic @xmath2 dependence but with reduced coefficients .  </S>",
    "<S> while the density matrices and momentum distributions differ between different spin components for small @xmath3 , at large @xmath3 they approach each other .  </S>",
    "<S> we show these by analytic arguments and numerical calculations up to @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 . </S>"
