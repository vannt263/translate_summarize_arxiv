    "there is considerable current debate over the nature of superconductivity in quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) crystalline organic metals  @xcite .",
    "the most heavily studied members of this family of materials are the @xmath2-phase bedt - ttf salts ( e.g. )  @xcite . whilst nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , penetration - depth  @xcite , tunnelling  @xcite and other experiments  @xcite appear to suggest that the superconductivity in these salts may be d - wave - like and mediated by spin - density - wave - like fluctuations , some doubts have been cast by recent controversial specific heat measurements , which may suggest that the order parameter does not possess the required nodes  @xcite .",
    "several theories  @xcite stress the importance of the details of the fermi - surface topology in providing suitable prerequisites for superconductivity ; if the fermi - surface geometry and interactions are altered slightly , it appears that bcs - like s - wave superconductivity _ may _ be the dominant low - temperature groundstate  @xcite .    clearly , it is of importance to study organic superconductors with slight variations in fermi - surface topology so that the effect on the superconducting groundstate can be assessed . in this paper",
    "we therefore report magnetotransport and radiofrequency penetration - depth measurements of the superconductor .",
    "shubnikov - de haas oscillations , magnetic breakdown and angle - dependent magnetoresistance oscillations indicate that the effective masses of  and much of the topology of its fermi surface are similar to those of the most heavily - studied bedt - ttf superconductor ,",
    ". however , the magnetoresistance close to @xmath3 implies that the interplane transfer integral in  is approximately five times larger than that in , suggesting that  is less two - dimensional .",
    "this increased dimensionality is manifested in the superconducting properties of ; a clear two - dimensional to three dimensional crossover is seen in the temperature dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "we have also used the radiofrequency measurements to extract various parameters related to the interactions between the fluxoids and to reveal the melting of the vortex solid .",
    "when the innermost four sulphur atoms of bedt - ttf  @xcite are replaced by selenium to produce bets ( where bets stands for bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene ) , electrocrystallization gives rise to a range of charge - transfer salts with notably different properties compared to their bedt - ttf counterparts  @xcite .",
    "salts of the @xmath5-phase morphology are presently unique to the bets series , and  ( @xmath6  k ) remains the only superconducting bets charge - transfer salt found thus far  @xcite .",
    "crystals of the @xmath5-phase exist in the form of needles with the long axis of the needle corresponding to the shortest lattice vector @xmath7  @xcite . at first sight , the crystal structure looks quasi - one - dimensional , with the bets molecules packing roughly parallel in the planes between the anions  @xcite .",
    "however , the bets sites are not equivalent , and the cation molecules in fact occur in dimers , surrounded roughly isotropically by four nearest - neighbour dimers with the same orientation .",
    "the crystallographic unit cell contains two dimers , and hence contributes two holes  @xcite .",
    "although the details of the cation positioning and symmetry are rather different than in  @xcite , the overall similarity of the dimer arrangements lead one to expect a fermi surface for  which is topologically similar to that in .",
    "indeed , the calculated bandstructure of  predicts a fermi surface consisting of a quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) hole pocket ( the @xmath8 pocket ) and a pair of warped quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) sheets  @xcite . according to the calculations , the @xmath8 pocket in this case",
    "is expected to occupy @xmath9  % of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",

    "after the superconducting to normal transition , the resistance risies until a series of low - frequency shubnikov - de haas oscillations emerges at about 33  t. these grow in amplitude , until at about 45  t , a higher frequency series of oscillations becomes visible .",
    "the inset shows a fourier transform of the magnetoresistance data .",
    "the lower of the two frequencies @xmath22 ( believed to originate from the @xmath8 pocket ) is @xmath23  t. the higher frequency of @xmath24  t , which occurs at fields above @xmath14  45  t , corresponds to an area in @xmath25-space approximately equal to the brillouin - zone cross - section ; following common usage in other charge - transfer salts  @xcite , we will refer to this as the @xmath21 frequency @xmath26 .",
    "frequencies equivalent to the brillouin - zone area are readily observed in other charge - transfer salts ( typically in @xmath2 and @xmath8-phase salts of the form ( bedt - ttf)@xmath27x ) as a result of magnetic breakdown , whereby electrons tunnel between the q1d and q2d sections of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
