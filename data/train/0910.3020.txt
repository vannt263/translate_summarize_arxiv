    "the hierarchy problem has for years been taken as a strong motivation for theories of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most attractive ideas for solving this problem as it naturally gives gauge coupling unification and a dark matter candidate .",
    "however the mssm predicts a light higgs boson , near the z mass , while lep placed a lower limit on the higgs mass of 114 gev . to satisfy the lep bound , the stop quark must be taken to be @xmath2 so that radiative corrections from the top quark increase the higgs mass sufficiently .",
    "thus supersymmetry ( susy ) must be broken above the weak scale , recreating a fine - tuning of @xmath3 or worse in the soft susy - breaking parameters in order to reproduce the observed value of the weak scale .",
    "this is how the little hierarchy problem appears in the context of the mssm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we point out that a vector - like fourth generation can solve this problem by adding extra radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "this solution is straightforward , relying mostly on having new quarks , and is thus predictive . in order to remove the fine - tuning and avoid current experimental constraints",
    "there must be at least one new colored particle with mass between roughly 300 gev and 600 gev , easily discoverable at the lhc .",
    "as we will show , this solves the little hierarchy problem while naturally preserving the success of unification .",
    "alternative solutions to the little hierarchy problem in the mssm either involve large couplings which spoil unification or require new gauge or global symmetries , a very low messenger scale or a carefully chosen set of soft susy - breaking parameters @xcite .",
    "other solutions involve extensions of the higgs sector to create unusual decays of the higgs in order to avoid lep bounds @xcite .",
    "twin and little higgs theories have also been proposed to solve the little hierarchy problem @xcite by extending the symmetries of the standard model to a larger structure with a collective breaking pattern , though these theories only push the cutoff up to @xmath4 tev @xcite .",
    "a chiral fourth generation has been considered before but does not solve the little hierarchy problem and runs into difficulty with the large yukawa couplings necessary to avoid experimental constraints leading to low scale landau poles @xcite .",
    "a vector - like generation has been proposed @xcite but its possible use in solving the little hierarchy problem was only appreciated in @xcite .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : constraints ] why we believe the problem is more fully ameliorated than was claimed in @xcite .    in section [ sec : themodel ]",
    "the model is presented .",
    "section [ sec : rge ] presents the renormalization group analysis .",
    "section [ sec : spectrum ] presents the physical masses of the new particles . in section [ sec : constraints ] we calculate the experimental constraints on our model from direct collider production and precision electroweak observables . in section [ sec : higgsmass ] we evaluate the higgs mass . in section [ sec : pheno ] we discuss collider signatures of this model .",
    "we add a full vector - like generation to the mssm with the following yukawa interactions @xmath5 and mass terms @xmath6 in the superpotential .",
    "the subscript @xmath7 denotes the new generation . in equations and and the rest of the paper",
    ", we use the familiar notation of the mssm @xcite .",
    "the superpotential implicitly assumes a discrete parity under which the new matter is charged .",
    "this parity forbids mixing between the new generation and the standard model .",
    "this parity does not affect the higgs mass in this model but has other interesting phenomenological consequences that are discussed in section [ sec : parity ] .",
    "it is also possible to write the model without this parity in which case the first term in eqn .",
    "is extended to a full 4x4 yukawa matrix allowing mixing between all the generations .",
    "these mixings , if present , have to be small from fcnc limits @xcite and we will assume this to be the case .    upon susy breaking , the terms in contribute to the higgs quartic . including the contribution from the top yukawa @xmath8 , the higgs mass @xmath9 in this model is roughly given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 gev is the electroweak symmetry breaking vev .",
    "the contributions from the new yukawa couplings add linearly to @xmath12 and so can increase @xmath12 more effectively than the usual logarithmic contribution from raising the stop masses . as a result , this model can be compatible with the lep limit on the higgs mass with smaller soft scalar masses , and is significantly less tuned .",
    "we calculate the higgs mass more precisely in section [ sec : higgsmass ] .    for example , with @xmath13 , the size of the logarithmic corrections in is roughly three times that of the top sector alone . in this case , a higgs mass @xmath14 gev can be obtained with soft masses @xmath15 gev ( taking @xmath16 and the vector masses @xmath17 gev ) . for similar parameters , in the mssm , the stop has to be @xmath18 tev in order that @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "since the higgs vev is quadratically sensitive to the soft scalar masses , we expect the tuning in our model to be alleviated by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "we first make some qualitative remarks about the parameter space of the model .",
    "the corrections to @xmath21 from the new generation scale as the fourth power of the couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see equation ) . if these couplings are much smaller than the top yukawa , their effects become quickly subdominant . moreover , these yukawas renormalize each other and the top yukawa and can lead to uv landau poles . motivated by gauge coupling unification , we impose the requirement that these landau poles lie beyond the gut scale .",
    "this sets an upper bound on the low energy values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath8 is close to its fixed point , we expect this bound to lie around the fixed point .",
    "these two considerations lead us to expect @xmath22 and @xmath23 to lie in a technically natural , but narrow , range around @xmath8 .",
    "the superpotential can also contain yukawa terms between the higgs sector and the leptonic components of the new generation ( _ e.g _ @xmath24 ) .",
    "these terms will also contribute to the higgs quartic .",
    "however , the color factor for these loops is a third of the color factor for the quark loops .",
    "hence , we expect these corrections to be subdominant , unless the couplings are large .",
    "but , these leptonic yukawas become non - perturbative more easily than the quark yukawas since their one loop beta functions are unaffected by the strong coupling constant @xmath25 ( see section [ sec : rge ] ) .",
    "this constrains these yukawas to be be smaller than the corresponding quark yukawas and hence they do not make significant corrections to the higgs mass . in this paper , we assume that these yukawas are small and ignore their effects on the phenomenology .",
    "the contributions to @xmath21 from the new vector - like generation is a function of susy breaking in that sector and is suppressed by @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 , the soft mass , is the difference between the scalar and fermion mass squares respectively .",
    "these contributions are unsuppressed when @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath27 contributes quadratically to the higgs vev , the tuning in this model is minimized when @xmath29 .",
    "this leads us to expect the masses of the new generation to lie around @xmath30 gev - a range easily accessible to the lhc .",
    "in this section , we study the renormalization group evolution of all the parameters . we identify the regions of the @xmath22-@xmath23 parameter space where the theory is free of landau poles up to the gut scale .",
    "the addition of the new vector - like generation also affects the evolution of gauge couplings .",
    "since the new particles form complete @xmath31 multiplets , gauge coupling unification is preserved in this scenario .",
    "however , the extra matter fields do change the running of gaugino and soft scalar masses .",
    "the evolution of the gauge couplings @xmath32 are governed by the equations @xcite @xmath33 with the particle content of this model @xmath34 , and the gauge couplings unify perturbatively at roughly @xmath35 gev .",
    "the running of the yukawa couplings are governed by @xmath36 in writing the above , we have ignored contributions to these expressions from the yukawa couplings in the down and lepton sector .",
    "this is reasonable in the regime of moderate @xmath37 where the down and lepton yukawas are small .",
    "similarly , we have also ignored mixing terms between the vector - like generation and the standard model , since these yukawas also have to be small to evade fcnc constraints .",
    "the running of these couplings is governed by the competition between the yukawa and the gauge couplings . since the gauge interactions themselves get stronger in the uv , in particular the strong coupling @xmath25 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gauge rges ] ) , the model is able to accommodate low energy values of @xmath38 without any coupling hitting a landau pole below the gut scale , in order to preserve perturbative unification .",
    "we plot this parameter space in the @xmath22 - @xmath23 plane in figure [ fig : yzplot ] .",
    "the above perturbativity analysis was performed at the one loop level .",
    "higher loop contributions to the beta functions were included in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "these additional contributions cause the gauge couplings to become non - perturbative roughly around the unification scale @xmath35 gev .",
    "this suggests that in the presence of a vector - like generation , the physics at the unification scale may be more compatible with orbifold gut constructions instead of simple 4d unification scenarios .",
    "we note that these orbifold constructions offer several advantages over simple 4d unification scenarios , including natural ways to incorporate doublet - triplet splitting and avoiding dimension 5 proton decay constraints .",
    "it is also possible that the flavor structure of the sm is generated at a scale below the gut scale and thus the yukawa couplings need only remain perturbative up to that intermediate scale , which will expand the available parameter space .",
    "we show an example where flavor is generated below @xmath39 in figure [ fig : yzplot ] .",
    "the modified gauge couplings also affect the running of the soft gaugino and scalar masses . the weak scale soft scalar masses were computed ( using @xcite ) after imposing the condition that the low energy gluino and electroweakino masses obey current bounds ( @xmath40 gev , and @xmath41 gev ) @xcite . with this constraint on the gaugino masses , we find that the typical size of soft scalar masses in this model is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the scale at which the soft masses ( @xmath44 gev ) are generated . a primordial susy breaking scale @xmath43 larger than @xmath45 gev will drag the soft scalar masses up and reintroduce tuning .",
    "susy breaking at scales @xmath46 gev are natural in many models of susy breaking _",
    "e.g. _  gauge mediation .",
    "these susy breaking models also address many of the other problems that plague the mssm and they can naturally accommodate our framework . note that if the soft scalar masses are universal for the various generations at the scale @xmath43 ( as one might expect for example in gauge mediated susy breaking ) , then the running to the weak scale does not induce large variation between the generations",
    ". we will generally assume universal weak scale soft scalar masses for the third and fourth generations when determining the higgs mass within this model .",
    "the large yukawa couplings and susy breaking gaugino masses also drive the generation of @xmath47 terms .",
    "these @xmath47 terms also make small , but significant corrections to the higgs mass . as with the yukawa couplings , when computing the higgs mass we consider only the @xmath48 type @xmath47 terms : @xmath49 .",
    "the beta functions of @xmath47 terms consist of terms proportional to themselves and terms proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings . with the yukawa couplings of interest to this paper , @xmath47 terms @xmath50",
    "are generated for the third and fourth generations even when they are zero at the susy breaking scale .",
    "for example , gauge mediation typically gives zero @xmath47 terms at the susy breaking scale . in the context of such theories ,",
    "renormalization group evolution can lead to weak scale @xmath47 terms @xmath51 for the generations that have @xmath52 yukawa couplings , with much smaller values for the first two generations .",
    "in other susy breaking scenarios such as gravity mediation , the @xmath47 terms are free parameters and can also easily be @xmath53 gev . using this input from the renormalization group flow , in this paper",
    ", we generally take @xmath47 terms @xmath53 gev for the third and fourth generations while computing the corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "the vector masses run proportional to themselves , and their running is affected by both the yukawa couplings ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and the gauge couplings @xmath32 .",
    "the low energy values of these vector masses depend upon the scale at which they were generated . for the new generation to ameliorate the tuning in the higgs sector",
    ", these vector masses must also be at the weak scale ( see section [ sec : themodel ] ) .",
    "this requirement leads to a  @xmath54-problem \" in this model .",
    "it is conceivable that the physics responsible for creating these masses is tied to the generation of the @xmath54 parameter of the mssm .",
    "since @xmath54 is often tied to susy breaking , we will assume that these vector masses are also generated at this scale @xmath43 . with vector masses",
    "@xmath30 gev at @xmath55 gev , we find that the weak scale masses for the colored particles are @xmath56 . under the same conditions , the electroweak particles receive masses @xmath57 .",
    "the renormalization group analysis shows that it is theoretically possible for the new generation to have reasonably large yukawa couplings @xmath58 to the higgs sector without losing perturbative unification . in this context , with susy breaking @xmath59 gev , this scenario can yield soft scalar masses @xmath60 gev , while remaining consistent with experimental bounds on gaugino masses .",
    "this parameter space also supports vector masses @xmath30 gev for the colored components of the new generation . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the mass spectrum of this model after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "upon electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath61 doublet @xmath62 splits to yield an up - type quark @xmath63 and a down - type quark @xmath64 . in addition to the vector mass",
    ", these quarks also receive mass from the higgs vev .",
    "the mass matrices for these quarks can be expressed as @xmath65 where the superscripts @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the up and down components of the doublet .",
    "the mass eigenstates are obtained by bidiagonalizing the above mass matrices . in the limit @xmath68 and @xmath69 ,",
    "the eigenvalues simplify to @xmath70 electroweak symmetry breaking splits the spectrum into two mass eigenstates , one with mass @xmath71 and the other of mass @xmath72 . in the next section , we study the experimental constraints on these new particles from direct collider searches and precision electroweak observables .",
    "the collider signatures of the new quarks in superpotential depend upon its decay channels to the standard model .",
    "if the new generation mixes with the standard model , these quarks will decay to the standard model through @xmath73 or @xmath74 emission .",
    "these decay channels are constrained by cdf , which imposes a lower bound @xmath75 gev on the mass of a new down - type quark @xcite .",
    "the bound on a new up - type quark depends upon its branching fraction for decays to @xmath73s .",
    "if this branching fraction is 100 % , cdf imposes a lower bound @xmath76 gev @xcite .",
    "however , in this model , this branching fraction can be significantly smaller since it depends upon the unknown mixing angle between the new generation and the standard model .",
    "in particular , when both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are non - zero , it is possible for the mass of the lightest down - type quark to be smaller than that of the lightest up - type quark .",
    "but , their mass difference could nevertheless be smaller than the @xmath73 mass ( see equation [ eqn : updownmasses ] ) . in this case , the up - type quark can dominantly decay to the down - type quark and soft standard model final states as long as it is heavier than the down - type quark by a few gev . the cdf search does not limit this scenario .",
    "consequently , we will take a lower bound of @xmath75 gev on the mass of the new quarks .",
    "it is also possible that the new generation is endowed with a parity that forbids it from mixing with the standard model .",
    "we discuss this phenomenology in section [ sec : parity ] where we show that as a result of the new parity , the new quarks are meta - stable on collider time scales .",
    "the lifetimes are somewhat model dependent , but can easily be @xmath77 s even for a 500 gev quark .",
    "the strongest constraint on this decay mode comes from a cdf search for meta - stable champs @xcite .",
    "this study constrains the mass of a meta stable up - quark to be @xmath78 gev .",
    "the bound on a meta - stable down quark would be weaker by @xmath79 gev @xcite . in this model , it is possible for the meta - stable , lightest colored particle to be a down - type quark ( see equation [ eqn : updownmasses ] ) .",
    "consequently , in this scenario , the lower bound on the quark mass would be @xmath80 gev .",
    "irrespective of the mixing between the new generation and the standard model families , this model requires the new generation to couple to the higgs .",
    "this yukawa interaction contributes to the precision electroweak parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 and will impose a restriction on the vector masses . using the mass matrices , we computed the corrections to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in this model using @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath84 and the vector masses @xmath85 , we get    @xmath86    these contributions are within the 68% confidence limits on these electroweak parameters @xcite .",
    "these corrections decouple as @xmath87 with the vector mass @xmath88 and are quickly suppressed beyond @xmath89 gev .",
    "the corrections discussed in eqn .   were computed for the new fermion sector .",
    "their scalar partners also contribute to these quantities .",
    "however , since the scalars are heavier than the fermions , their contributions are more suppressed . using @xcite to estimate these corrections",
    ", we find that with vector masses @xmath90 gev and soft scalar masses @xmath91 , the net electroweak contributions from the new sector are within the 95% confidence limits on the electroweak observables .",
    "this constraint was also obtained using @xmath84 .",
    "the electroweak corrections are sensitive to the squares of the yukawas @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "hence , if either of these yukawas are a bit small , their contributions are rapidly suppressed and these constraints can be satisfied with even smaller soft scalar masses .",
    "the primary electroweak precision constraint is due to the @xmath82 parameter , @xmath92 .",
    "note that this seems to be the origin of the difference between our conclusions and those of @xcite .",
    "while we find that this constraint can be satisfied for @xmath93 gev , they require @xmath94 tev .",
    "they seem to have used a formula for @xmath95 that is a factor of 4 larger than ours .",
    "we would find their result if we had a symmetric mass matrix instead of the asymmetric matrix in equation .",
    "further , this factor of roughly 4 between a symmetric and an asymmetric matrix is confirmed by @xcite .",
    "taking the vector mass to be a tev requires also raising the scalar soft masses to around a tev in order to get a significant contribution to the higgs quartic , thus recreating the fine - tuning necessary to get the correct higgs vev .    in order to accommodate these experimental constraints",
    ", we will assume that the vector masses @xmath96 gev for the rest of the paper .",
    "this forces all new fermions to be heavier than @xmath75 gev ( see equation ) , in agreement with the cdf bound on rapidly decaying particles .",
    "note that colored fermions at 256 gev would still be in conflict with collider searches if these particles are stable on collider timescales .",
    "consequently , @xmath96 gev satisfies all constraints only when the new generation mixes with the standard model . in the absence of this mixing , the collider bound forces the vector mass @xmath97 gev so that the lightest colored particle is heavier than @xmath15 gev .    the leptonic spectrum is also split by electroweak symmetry breaking ( see equation ) .",
    "however , if these leptonic yukawas are small ( see section [ sec : themodel ] ) , this part of the particle spectrum will be relatively unaffected by electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "consequently , we expect the new leptons to be roughly around their vector masses @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the most stringent constraints on these particles come from lep , which imposes a lower bound @xmath100 gev @xcite .",
    "in this section , we calculate the corrections to the higgs mass from the new generation .",
    "we restrict the parameter space of the model to that allowed by current experimental bounds , namely , @xmath90 gev and the condition that the yukawa couplings remain perturbative up to the gut scale .",
    "the correction to the higgs mass was computed using the one loop effective potential method .",
    "the mass matrices in equation for the quarks @xmath101 were bi - diagonalized .",
    "for the scalars , diagonal susy breaking soft scalar masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 were added to the supersymmetric masses in equation .",
    "we also added @xmath47 terms @xmath53 gev to the scalar mass matrix . @xmath47",
    "terms of this size at the weak scale can be naturally realized from renormalization group effects even if they are negligible at the high scale ( see section [ sec : rge ] ) .",
    "the resultant scalar mass matrix was diagonalized .",
    "the mass eigenstates obtained from this procedure were used to calculate the one loop effective potential .",
    "this potential was used to obtain the higgs mass in the decoupling limit .",
    "the above computations were performed numerically and their results are summarized in figures [ fig : yzplot ] , [ fig : mqmuplot ] and [ fig : higgsplot ] .",
    "figure [ fig : yzplot ] displays the parameter space in the @xmath104 plane which solves the little hierarchy problem while remaining consistent with perturbative unification .",
    "this parameter space contains regions where @xmath23 is negligible and the higgs mass corrections arise from @xmath22 .",
    "this suggests that this framework can solve the little hierarchy problem with just the coupling @xmath105 .",
    "this coupling requires the addition of just a vector - like antisymmetric @xmath31 tensor @xmath106 .",
    "the little hierarchy problem can be solved in this manner , although , the allowed range of @xmath22 is smaller .",
    "this is because the gauge couplings run less without the contributions from the vector - like @xmath107 and hence they compete less against the yukawa contributions in equation .",
    "this causes the yukawas to become non - perturbative more rapidly , restricting @xmath108 .",
    "in addition to producing a higgs mass in excess of the lep bound , our model must satisfy the experimental constraints on the masses of the stop and the fourth generation states . in figure",
    "[ fig : mqmuplot ] we plot the allowed region of the vector mass - soft mass parameter space for various values of @xmath109 and a unified a - term @xmath110 .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the lower bound on the vector mass discussed in the previous section .",
    "lep searches place a lower bound on the lightest stop mass of 96 gev @xcite ; for given ( @xmath109 , @xmath47 ) this places a lower bound on the soft mass parameter @xmath111 .",
    "this lower bound appears as the horizontal sections of the two lower curves in figure [ fig : mqmuplot ] .",
    "for values of @xmath111 above this bound the parameter space is constrained by the higgs mass bound , producing the rising parts of the curves . given these lower bounds on @xmath112 and @xmath111 ,",
    "the fourth generation squarks are automatically above their experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "if the soft scalar masses of the first two generations are similar to that of the third , then our assumption of small @xmath47 terms for the first two generations ensures that those squarks are heavier than the lightest stop .",
    "we see that the higgs mass in this model is larger than the lep bound even with soft scalar masses @xmath113 gev .",
    "by contrast , in the mssm , the squarks have to be @xmath114 tev to overcome this bound .    in figure [",
    "fig : higgsplot ] , we study the higgs mass as a function of @xmath22 for @xmath115 , again with various choices of the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath47 . in this model ,",
    "higgs masses up to approximately 120 gev are possible .",
    "this illustrates the possibility of solving the little hierarchy problem adding only the couplings to the vector - like @xmath117 multiplets .",
    "the yukawa interactions between the new quarks and the higgs are the biggest source of corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "these quarks have to be light in order to significantly affect the higgs mass ( see sections [ sec : themodel ] and [ sec : higgsmass ] ) . for moderate @xmath118 and soft susy - breaking masses @xmath119 gev",
    ", we expect the vector mass @xmath88 of the new quarks to be @xmath120 gev ( see figure [ fig : mqmuplot ] ) so that the higgs mass is larger than 114 gev .",
    "this vector mass implies the existence of two sets of quarks , one with mass @xmath121 gev and the other with mass @xmath122 gev ( see equation ) . of course",
    ", the vector mass can be higher than @xmath123 gev if @xmath109 is larger .",
    "for example , with @xmath124 , the vector mass can be as large as @xmath125 gev ( giving rise to one @xmath126 gev quark ) and still make the higgs sufficiently heavy .",
    "the model thus predicts an abundance of light colored particles at the lhc : standard model squarks with masses @xmath127 gev , two new quarks and their superpartners , with at least one of the quarks being lighter than @xmath126 gev .",
    "the existence of the leptonic sector of the new generation is not required to explain the higgs mass ( see section [ sec : themodel ] ) .",
    "however , we expect this new sector to exist in order to preserve gauge coupling unification",
    ". the model by itself does not place direct bounds on the vector mass of these leptons .",
    "but , if the vector mass of the new generation has a common , unified origin , the leptons will be significantly lighter than the quarks due to renormalization ( see section [ sec : rge ] ) .",

    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the higgs phenomenology in this model .",
    "mixing between the new generation and the standard model leads to rapid ( on collider time scales ) decays of the new generation to the standard model .",
    "the new quarks will decay through the production of @xmath73s .",
    "the subsequent leptonic decays of the @xmath73 is a standard , low background way to search for these quarks at the lhc . with 100 @xmath129 of data ,",
    "the lhc reach for these new quarks is at least @xmath130 gev @xcite .",
    "this reach should cover most of the expected mass range of the new quarks .",
    "the phenomenology of the new lepton sector with vector masses is different from that of a new chiral lepton sector . in particular",
    ", the neutrinos of this sector will have large @xmath44 gev masses .",
    "this changes the collider signatures of this new lepton sector since the heavy neutrinos can also decay to the standard model . in conventional searches for fourth generation chiral leptons ,",
    "the fourth generation neutrinos are assumed to be massless @xcite , preventing them from decaying to the standard model . on the other hand",
    ", a new heavy neutrino can decay to produce lepton - rich signals , discriminating it more from standard model background . the lhc reach for this novel lepton sector",
    "needs further study @xcite .",
    "the new generation might respect a discrete parity that forbids it from mixing with the standard model ( _ e.g. _  superpotential ) . in this case , the superpotential does not allow the lightest new quark to decay .",
    "naively , this model would appear to be ruled out by stringent constraints on long - lived colored relics .",
    "however , it is possible for these quarks to decay to their leptonic counterparts ( which are typically lighter than the quarks due to renormalization effects ) and the standard model through baryon - number violating operators . a natural source of such operators",
    "can be found in supersymmetric gut theories @xcite .",
    "for example , if the superpotential is embedded into a @xmath31 gut , the term @xmath131 can emerge from the @xmath31 invariant operator @xmath132 . using the higgs triplet @xmath133 , this gut operator yields @xmath134 . integrating out the heavy higgs triplets and using the familiar interactions between the triplets and the standard model",
    ", we get the dimension five operator in the superpotential    @xmath135    which leads to the decay of the quark to its leptonic counterpart and the standard model .",
    "the decay lifetime is    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the bottom yukawa and @xmath138 is the phase space ( equal to the mass difference between the colored and leptonic components ) available for the decay .",
    "similar decay operators can also be generated from embedding the coupling @xmath139 into a gut .",
    "however , these operators will also be suppressed by @xmath137 since the terms in the superpotential connect the new generation to @xmath48 and not @xmath140 .",
    "since a dimension 5 decay through the higgs triplet must involve couplings to both @xmath48 and @xmath140 , the standard model enters this operator through its interactions with @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , these operators are at least suppressed by the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath137 .",
    "the lifetime in equation should be regarded as an upper bound for the quarks in a gut theory , since we expect the higgs triplet to couple to the light particles in most guts .",
    "but , it is possible for the quarks to decay more rapidly than .",
    "for example , new physics at the gut scale can lead to faster decays with lifetimes @xmath141 s @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the lifetime of long lived colored particles is sensitive to their abundance .",
    "this abundance is uncertain due to non - perturbative processes that occur during the qcd phase transition @xcite . under the assumptions of @xcite ,",
    "decays with lifetimes @xmath142 s are unconstrained by cosmology .",
    "but , with the caveats in @xcite , the abundance could be larger than the estimates of @xcite . in this case , it is possible for these decays to have cosmological implications .",
    "for example , these decays may help explain the primordial lithium problems @xcite .",
    "regardless of their cosmological impact , long lived colored particles give rise to striking signals in colliders @xcite .",
    "the colored particles , upon production , will travel through the detector where they will lose energy due to electromagnetic and hadronic interactions , giving rise to charged tracks in the detector .",
    "a fraction of these particles will stop in the detector and eventually decay .",
    "since these decays are uncorrelated with the beam , they can be distinguished from most backgrounds .",
    "the lhc reach for such meta - stable quarks is at least 1 tev @xcite .",
    "the discrete parity also leads to interesting phenomenology in the lepton sector , since it stabilizes the lightest leptonic particle .",
    "if the lighest particle is the new neutrino , it is a natural candidate for wimp dark matter .",
    "this neutrino by itself couples too strongly to the @xmath74 and is in conflict with bounds from dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "however , this problem can be solved if this neutrino mixes with a standard model singlet @xmath143 through the term @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the singlet @xmath143 and the yukawa coupling @xmath145 could emerge naturally in a @xmath146 gut from the @xmath146 invariant yukawa @xmath147 .",
    "gluon fusion is the dominant production channel for the higgs at the lhc .",
    "the new quarks contribute to this channel and can enhance the production cross - section .",
    "this enhancement is smaller than the case of a chiral fourth generation @xcite since the additional contributions are suppressed by the vector mass @xmath88 .",
    "the enhancement should roughly scale as @xmath148 and is @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "the mass spectrum may also permit the decay of the higgs to the new leptons .",
    "it is possible for this decay channel to be the dominant decay mode of the higgs since we expect the new generation to have @xmath151 yukawas to the higgs .",
    "the subsequent decay of the new leptons to the standard model might offer a new way to discover the higgs and the new leptons . this possibility merits further study .",
    "a new vector - like generation with @xmath151 yukawa couplings has interesting phenomenological consequences . owing to the vector mass , collider and precision electroweak constraints",
    "are more easily avoided .",
    "this is unlike the case of a chiral fourth generation where these constraints rapidly force the theory to become non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "low energy non - perturbativity can be avoided in such models at the cost of drastically reduced tree - level contributions to the higgs mass , further accentuating the little hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "a vector mass , on the other hand , easily avoids experimental constraints and simultaneously allows a solution to the little hierarchy problem .",
    "furthermore such a solution is predictive .",
    "the new generation can significantly ameliorate the tuning of the higgs vev if it has a mass between @xmath152 gev , along with soft scalar masses between @xmath153 gev .",
    "the spectrum contains many light , colored particles which would be well within the lhc reach .",
    "our model motivates consideration of several novel collider signatures .",
    "a vector - like generation can give rise to unique decay channels for the new leptons and neutrinos .",
    "the new generation also changes the collider phenomenology of the higgs sector .",
    "in addition to increasing the higgs production cross section , the new generation allows for non - standard higgs decay channels .",
    "it is also possible for this framework to contain long - lived quarks .",
    "these quarks give rise to striking signatures at colliders and may help solve the primordial lithium problems .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of this new sector deserves further consideration .    in this paper , we discussed the effects of a new vector - like generation on the higgs mass .",
    "in addition to its effects on higgs physics , a new vector - like generation could also have other phenomenological uses .",
    "for example , it may help explain the hierarchy in the fermion mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "it could also arise in string constructions where the number of chiral generations emerges as a result of a mismatch between the number of left - handed and right - handed chiral fields .",
    "in such a construction , it may also be possible to address the new @xmath54 problem raised by this scenario .",
    "it is also possible for these new @xmath151 yukawa couplings to modify the electroweak phase transition and stimulate electroweak baryogenesis . in this case",
    ", there might be additional signatures of this model , for example , gravitational wave signals that may be observable in upcoming experiments @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a fourth generation would clearly have important implications for uv physics beyond just this model .",
    "_ note added : _ while this paper was in the final stages of preparation , @xcite appeared which has some overlap with this work .",
