    "particles with opposite spins and non - zero magnetic moments will go their separate ways in a nonuniform magnetic field , which is well known as stern - gerlach effect  @xcite .",
    "most recently , this kind of effect is theoretically predicted in a generalized version for some effective nonuniform fields  @xcite , e.g. , a chirality - dependent induced gauge potential for chiral molecules resulting from three nonuniform light fields even in the absence of the nonuniform magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a similar effect for non - polarized slow light has been experimentally observed as the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite enhanced deflection by a small magnetic field gradient  @xcite .",
    "it is also experimentally demonstrated with a spatially distributed control field  @xcite .",
    "such spatial motion of light in the eit atomic medium has been well explained by a semi - classical theory based on the spatial dependence of the refraction index of the atomic medium  @xcite and a fully quantum approach  @xcite based on the excitation of the dark polaritons  the mixtures of a photon and an atomic collective excitation  @xcite .",
    "the latter one takes advantage of revealing the wave - particle duality of dark polaritons .",
    "and its crucial point of explanation is to derive the effective schrdinger equation for the propagation of slow light in the eit medium .    however the above eit - enhanced deflection of non - polarized light",
    "can not be simply explained as an analog of the conventional stern - gerlach effect since only one component of the `` spin '' is available  @xcite .",
    "an analog between light ray and atomic beam only appears in the polarized material .",
    "birefringence  the decomposition of a ray of light into two rays dependent on the polarization when it passes through certain types of material , is classically formalized by assigning two different refractive indices to the material for different polarizations . in this sense , it is the stern - gerlach effect of light .    in this paper",
    "we study a generalized stern - gerlach effect of a quantized polarized light as a phenomenon of birefringence .",
    "the anisotropic material is artificial .",
    "it is an atomic ensemble controlled by a specially - designed magneto - optical manipulation based on the eit mechanism .",
    "two eit configurations are formed by an optical field with a transverse spatial profile , since a magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the ground - state . to represent an analog between birefringence of quantized light and the stern - gerlach effect , an effective schrdinger equation is established for the spatial motion of two polarized components of light .",
    "such effective equation of motion describes a quasi - spin with an effective magnetic moment in an effective nonuniform magnetic field .",
    "the spatial gradient results from the transverse spatial profile of the optical field , and the effective magnetic moment is proportional to the two photon detuning with connection to the corresponding optical field and the atomic transition .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .

    "<S> we study the birefringence of the quantized polarized light in a magneto - optically manipulated atomic ensemble as a generalized stern - gerlach effect of light . to explain this engineered birefringence </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , we derive an effective shrdinger equation for the spatial motion of two orthogonally polarized components , which behave as a spin with an effective magnetic moment leading to a stern - gerlach split in a nonuniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that electromagnetically - induced - transparency mechanism can enhance the magneto - optical stern - gerlach effect of light in the presence of a control field with a transverse spatial profile and a nonuniform magnetic field . </S>"
