    "a liquid drop can deform a soft elastic substrate due to capillary forces @xcite .",
    "elastic deformations take place over a length on the order of the elastocapillary length @xmath2 , where @xmath5 is the liquid surface tension and @xmath6 the solid young s modulus .",
    "recent experiments have considered liquids on very soft elastomers with @xmath2 of the order of 1 - 100 microns and have reported many interesting features , such as the geometry near the contact line @xcite , compression of the solid @xcite , evaporation and spreading dynamics @xcite , as well as migration of droplets on substrates with a stiffness gradient @xcite .    while the contact angle of a drop on a rigid , homogeneous substrate is governed by young s law , the contact angle selection for a drop on a soft deformable substrate is still debated .",
    "one of the earliest theoretical approaches consisted of treating the elastic energy stored below the contact line as an effective line tension @xcite .",
    "this predicts an increase of the apparent , macroscopic contact angle on soft surfaces , which has been contradicted by recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the line tension approach did not include the surface energy of the solid , which turns out to be a crucial factor for the shaping of soft solids .",
    "such surface effects were introduced by @xcite and @xcite in a purely macroscopic theory based on the balance of forces exerted  on \" the contact line . in this framework , the microscopic contact angles always obey neumann s law , regardless of @xmath6 , as if the substrate at the contact line was a liquid .",
    "the same work reveals that there exists a transition for the apparent macroscopic contact angle , controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the drop size .",
    "by contrast , a microscopic description based on van der waals interactions @xcite suggests that young s law for the microscopic contact angle is recovered for @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the characteristic length of molecular interactions .",
    "the formation of a solid cusp below the contact line arises for @xmath3 , and the corresponding contact angles generically differ from neumann s law , even for very soft substrates .",
    "the controversy on the selection of contact angles on soft substrates underlines the difficulty of defining a force balance near the contact line @xcite .",
    "this has two distinct reasons : on the one hand , the difference between macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of capillarity , and on the other hand , the difference between surface stress @xmath9 ( force per unit length ) which is manifested in the superficial layers of a solid , and surface free energy @xmath5 ( energy per unit area ) .",
    "the latter is due to the coupling of elastic strain and surface free energy , an effect that is absent for liquid - liquid interfaces .",
    "surface stress and surface energy are related by a thermodynamic law known as the shuttleworth equation , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the elastic strain parallel to the interface @xcite .",
    "the strain dependence @xmath12 is directly responsible for tangential elastic stress transmitted below the contact line @xcite , usually ignored in elasto - capillary modeling .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the contact angle selection from a thermodynamic perspective , using variational calculus ",
    "i.e. without relying on a mechanical view in terms of a force balance .",
    "the challenge is to derive the contact angles directly by minimising capillary and elastic free energies .",
    "an important question then is whether microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of capillarity will give consistent results . to make progress ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the shuttleworth - effect is absent , i.e. @xmath13 , for which it was previously shown that the tangential elastic stress vanishes @xcite .",
    "combined with an incompressible thick substrate ( poisson ratio @xmath14 ) , this implies no in - plane displacements , making the problem amenable for detailed variational analysis .",
    "the key questions resolved here are how the contact angles and the elasto - capillary free energies evolve upon changing the substrates from perfectly rigid ( no deformation ) to extremely soft ( no elasticity ) .",
    "we predict the angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 as defined in fig .",

    "finally , the full shapes of the drops and the surface deflections are worked out for a case where the solid surface energies @xmath19 .",

    "the green s function reads @xmath27 in the incompressible limit .    before analyzing a two - dimensional drop ( fig .",

    "we anticipate a slope discontinuity @xmath36 at @xmath28 .",
    "the condition that @xmath37 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 take the same value at the contact line can be enforced by introducing two lagrange multipliers , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , into the energy functional : @xmath40 + \\lambda_{sv } \\left [ h(r ) - h_{sv}(r ) \\right],\\ ] ] where the lagrange multipliers can be interpreted as reaction forces ( per unit length ) .",

    "the last term represents the inverse fourier transform of the variation of @xmath50 , and involves the elastic normal stress @xmath51 when @xmath21 contains a dirac @xmath52-function at @xmath28 , this elastic stress could contribute to the boundary condition at @xmath28 , but within the macroscopic framework this can be excluded on a mathematical ground . as @xmath53 , a @xmath52-function contribution would require a ( weakly ) singular displacement , @xmath54 , and hence a ( weakly ) diverging elastic free energy .",
    "the equilibrium condition at the contact line is therefore determined by the surface energies only @xcite , implying a weaker singularity in the form of a discontinuity in @xmath55 .",
    "one can show that this implies a weakly diverging stress , @xmath56 , but an integrable free energy . given this singularity ,",
    "the physics may be significantly different when including microscopic effects .",
    "following for now the macroscopic derivation , the variations at the contact line , @xmath57 , determine the lagrange multipliers , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "combined with the boundary condition resulting from ( [ eq : dh ] ) , these expressions give @xmath60 which can be recognized as the vertical component of the neumann condition .",
    "this condition is analogous to that describing a liquid lens floating on another liquid , since the elastic energy does not give a contribution at the contact line .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium away from the contact line can be obtained by combining the integrals in ( [ eq : varh ] ) , giving @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the heaviside step - function , and @xmath63 the solid surface tension on the respective domains .",
    "this expression is not defined at @xmath28 , where instead it is replaced by a boundary condition ( [ eq : verneumann ] ) . for @xmath64 , the stress @xmath21 balances the laplace pressure due to curvature @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) of the wet ( dry ) solid interface .",
    "we now consider variations @xmath67 of the contact line position .",
    "this variation receives contributions from the integration limits in @xmath44 , from the contact line constraints ( terms involving @xmath68 ) , but once again not from the energy contribution @xmath50 . the total variation ( to be evaluated at @xmath28 ) gives @xmath69 where we inserted the values for @xmath38 , @xmath39 obtained previously . in the terms of the angles indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , this expression gives the horizontal neumann condition : @xmath70 to summarize , we recover the usual laplace pressure condition for the liquid interface @xmath29 .",
    "the solid interface shape @xmath20 follows from the balance ( [ eq : sigman ] ) of elastic stress @xmath21 and solid laplace pressure .",
    "the problem is closed by the vertical and horizontal neumann conditions ( [ eq : verneumann],[eq : horneumann ] ) , serving as boundary conditions for the angles at the contact line .",
    "we now consider a two - dimensional drop with contact lines at @xmath28 and @xmath71 .",
    "the expression for the free energy is similar to that for a single contact line , except that we have to consider two dry domains , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and one wet domain @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , minimization is done at constant drop volume @xmath75 .",
    "this constraint is enforced by adding the lagrange multiplier term @xmath76\\ ] ] to the total energy . since @xmath77 at @xmath78",
    ", the volume constraint does not contribute to the boundary conditions , and we recover ( [ eq : verneumann],[eq : horneumann ] ) .",
    "it does , however , introduce a contribution in the equilibrium equations for @xmath29 and @xmath20 , namely :    @xmath79    the first relation requires the liquid interface to have a constant curvature , corresponding to the laplace pressure @xmath80 .",
    "the second equation shows that @xmath81 also acts as external stress on the boundary of the elastic medium below the drop .",
    "it is instructive to incorporate the vertical boundary condition ( [ eq : verneumann ] ) in the elastic stress , as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the distribution of normal stress due to the capillary forces , @xmath84 this corresponds to the classical mechanical view of two localized forces pulling upwards at the contact line , and a laplace pressure pushing downward below the drop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]b ) .      in the limit of perfectly rigid solids",
    "one would expect to recover young s law .",
    "however , the macroscopic theory derived above shows that the wetting angles are given by the neumann conditions _ regardless of stiffness _",
    ", which is clearly unphysical .",
    "also , the elastic stress was found to be singular at the contact line .",
    "these artefacts are due to the assumption of localized line forces represented by @xmath52-functions in ( [ eq : fn ] ) . because the interface is diffuse at the molecular level and due to the finite range of van der waals interactions , capillary forces are in reality spread out over a finite width @xmath1 , typically a few nanometers .",

    "we propose a simplified model that captures the essence of these microscopic models , but yet allows for a numerical solution with realistic separation of microscopic scale ( @xmath85  nm ) and macroscopic scale ( @xmath86  mm ) .",

    "the contact angles display two distinct transitions that are governed by the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "solving for @xmath20 from ( [ eq : sigmadrop ] ) is challenging , owing to the integral nature of @xmath21 , the discontinuity in @xmath91 , and the presence of non - linear terms .",
    "we simplify the problem by considering the case @xmath92 , and assume @xmath93 to linearize the last term in ( [ eq : sigmadrop ] ) ; the latter condition is enforced by choosing moderate values of @xmath94 .",

    "we now describe how the wetting angles depend on the stiffness of the substrate .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the microscopic wetting angles @xmath104 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 ( fig .  [ fig : doubletransition ] ) , and the macroscopic angle @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]a ) .",
    "the former angles reveal the the microscopic geometry of the contact line region , while the latter is the apparent angle of the spherical cap with respect to the undeformed substrate .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : doubletransition ] are obtained for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and young s angle @xmath107 ( since @xmath19 ) .    , at fixed @xmath108 and @xmath106 .",

    "[ fig : doubletransition ] ]    our key finding is that the wetting angles undergo two transitions when changing the softness parameter : ( i ) the _ microscopic _ angles evolves continuously from young s law ( rigid limit ) to neumann s law ( soft limit ) , controlled by the parameter @xmath18 , ( ii ) the _ macroscopic _ apparent contact angle @xmath15 evolves continuously from young s law ( rigid limit ) to neumann s law ( soft limit ) , controlled by the parameter @xmath7 .",

    "the neumann cusp , as predicted in the macroscopic theory for all values of the stiffness , is only recovered for @xmath3 .",
    "the second transition does involve the apparent contact angle @xmath15 .",
    "as long as @xmath116 , this angle is unaffected by elastic deformations , as these are localized only in a narrow zone near the contact line .",
    "the macroscopic angle changes only once the scale of the deformation @xmath2 becomes comparable to the drop size @xmath0 , _",

    "[ fig : doubletransition ] , the solid - vapor angle @xmath118 in this limit , consistent with previous predictions @xcite .",

    "closely to @xmath128 for small and large @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the rigid limit was previously found by @xcite , who showed that for weak deformations the solid surface tension provides a natural regularization of the logarithmic divergence at the contact line .",

    "in this work , we have calculated the shapes of drops on soft substrates by minimization of the elastic and capillary energies .",
    "we find that in addition to the drop size @xmath0 and the elastocapillary length @xmath2 , a third length - scale is required in order to fully describe elastocapillary interactions : the molecular scale @xmath1 .",
    "this extra length scale is crucial for describing the young to non - young transition that occurs for sessile droplets on progressively softer substrates . in addition , the regularization is necessary to avoid a singularity of elastic stress at the contact line .",
    "such a singular tendency implies that , generically , the substrates will be deformed beyond the linear elastic regime ",
    "one expects strain hardening and even plasticity @xcite   which up to present have never been taken into account .",
    "in addition , the elastic free energy posed in ( [ eq : fel ] ) is strictly speaking only valid for small slopes of the solid substrate ; this is why our numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapes ] were chosen at moderate @xmath94 . for larger slopes",
    "one in principle has to deal with this ",
    "geometric \" nonlinearity , even when assuming that the rheology of the elastic solid remains linear .",

    "we have left out the second difficulty of the problem , namely the strain - dependence of surface free energies ( shuttleworth effect ) .",
    "such a strain - dependence has been shown to lead to significant tangential elastic stress @xcite .",
    "generically , this induces tangential displacements that are comparable in magnitude to the normal deflection of the substrate , hence changing the energetics of the problem .",
    "we emphasize again that this effect is of primary importance for _ quantitative _ comparison with experiments ; the more so since tangential stresses are expected to give an elastic contribution to the contact angle boundary condition @xcite .",
