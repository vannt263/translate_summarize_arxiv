    "<S> we present the results of a 200 ks chandra observation of part of the groth strip region , using the acis - i instrument . </S>",
    "<S> we present a relatively simple method for the detection of point - sources and calculation of limiting sensitivities , which we argue is at least as sensitive and more self - consistent than previous methods presented in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> 158 distinct x - ray sources are included in our point - source catalogue in the acis - i area . </S>",
    "<S> the number counts show a relative dearth of x - ray sources in this region . </S>",
    "<S> for example at a flux limit of @xmath0  erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 around 20 per cent more soft band sources are detected in the hdf - n and almost @xmath3  per cent more in the elais - n1 field , which we have analysed by the same method for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that these differences are consistent with poisson variations at @xmath4 significance , and therefore there is no evidence for cosmic variance based on these number counts alone . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the average spectra of the objects and find a marked difference between the soft - band selected sources , which have @xmath5 typical of unobscured agn , and the hard - band selected sources , which have @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> reassuringly , the sample as a whole has a mean spectrum of @xmath7 , the same as the x - ray background . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , our results imply that the fraction of sources with significant obscuration is only @xmath8  per cent , much less than predicted by standard agn population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by direct spectral fitting , with only a handful of objects showing evidence for absorption . after accounting for absorption , </S>",
    "<S> all objects are consistent with mean intrinsic spectrum of @xmath9 , very similar to local seyferts . </S>",
    "<S> the survey area is distinguished by having outstanding multi - waveband coverage . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with these observations and detailed discussion of the x - ray source properties will be presented in future papers .    </S>",
