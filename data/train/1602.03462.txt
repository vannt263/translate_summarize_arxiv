    "understanding the spectrum and structure of nucleon resonances has been among the main challenges in hadron physics ever since the discovery of the roper resonance .",
    "much experimental information on the photo- and electroexcitations of baryonic resonances has been collected at jefferson lab , mami , elsa , and other facilities  @xcite ; especially jefferson lab with the clas detector in hall b has contributed a large amount to the electroproduction world data in recent years .",
    "transition form factors over a wide kinematic domain are now available for a number of nucleon resonances and provide a unique window into the nonperturbative structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "there is still an abundance of open questions concerning the nature of resonances .",
    "are the three quarks in a baryon spatially equally distributed or do they cluster into diquarks ?",
    "what is the importance of molecular components that are generated by meson - baryon interactions , and how does the ` pion cloud ' reveal itself in form factors ?",
    "how are confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking manifest , and what is the microscopic origin of vector - meson dominance ?    to address these questions , it is desirable to establish a consistent microscopic description of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , nucleon and nucleon resonance properties within qcd .",
    "we will focus on the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) framework , whose basic promise is to calculate such observables from the nonperturbative structure of qcd s green functions  @xcite .",
    "while there has been progress with regard to meson spectrum and structure properties as well as nucleon and @xmath2 form factors ( among other areas ) , its application to excited baryons is still at an early stage . in the following we give a brief account of the approach on its way towards calculating nucleon resonances and transition form factors .",
    "to illustrate the basic ideas , consider an electromagnetic nucleon or nucleon - to - resonance transition form factor .",
    "its typical shape will be kindred to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : timelike - ffs-1 ] : its spacelike behavior ( @xmath3 ) is experimentally extracted from @xmath4 scattering or , in the case of a resonance , pion photo- and electroproduction .",
    "experimental information on timelike nucleon form factors above threshold comes from the reaction @xmath5 or its inverse . for nucleon resonances ,",
    "the region below threshold is indirectly accessible via the dalitz decays @xmath6 that contribute to the dilepton ` cocktail ' in @xmath7 and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the characteristic features in this regime are the vector - meson bumps that are produced when the photon fluctuates into @xmath1 and @xmath8 . the bump landscape in fig .",
    "[ fig : timelike - ffs-1 ] is drawn from the pion form factor , experimentally measured via @xmath9 , where this property is exposed due to the much smaller threshold ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "is it reasonable to expect a similar behavior also for nucleon transition form factors , and how can one understand these features from the quark level ?",
    "the current matrix element that encodes the form factors will be made of diagrams such as that in fig .",
    "[ fig : timelike - ffs-1 ] : the incoming baryon splits into its valence quarks which emit and reabsorb gluons , obtain a boost from the photon , and finally recombine into the outgoing baryon .",
    "the blobs represent the baryons covariant faddeev amplitudes , the quantum field - theoretical analogues of a baryon wave function .",
    "fortunately , these complicated interactions can be absorbed into a few compact building blocks : the faddeev amplitudes , the dressed quark propagator , and the dressed quark - photon vertex .",
    "the complete expression for the electromagnetic current matrix element is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] ; it also couples the photon to the two- and three - quark kernels and thereby satisfies electromagnetic gauge invariance . in turn",
    ", the faddeev amplitudes must be solved from their corresponding faddeev equations , which at the same time determine the masses of the baryons  @xcite .",
    "the quark propagator and kernels that enter the equations are not arbitrary but related to each other .",
    "the quark propagator is determined from its dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dse - bse ] .",
    "the resulting quark mass function becomes momentum - dependent ; it describes the transition from the input current - quark mass at large momenta to a nonperturbative , dressed ` constituent quark ' mass of a few hundred mev in the infrared . the analogous @xmath11 kernel that appears in a meson s bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )",
    "is connected to the quark propagator via chiral symmetry and the corresponding axial ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) , which pictorially amounts to ` cutting ' dressed quark lines in the dse ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the leading kernel contribution is a gluon exchange with a bare quark - gluon vertex ( ` rainbow - ladder ' ) ; the bse will then produce a ladder of gluons upon iteration .        in combination with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", the axial wti ensures that the pion is the massless goldstone boson in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "hence , if we solve the bse for the pion from fig .",
    "[ fig : dse - bse ] we will get these features for free : the pion mass follows the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation for small quark masses ( @xmath12 ) and vanishes in the chiral limit where the current - quark mass @xmath13 is zero .",
    "another key ingredient is the quark - photon vertex : its inhomogeneous bse ( cf .",
    "[ fig : quark - diquark ] ) features the same @xmath11 kernel , so the resulting vertex respects the vector wti which is a necessary prerequisite for electromagnetic gauge invariance and thus current conservation .",
    "in addition , the bse automatically generates vector - meson poles in the transverse part of the vertex  @xcite .",
    "since any form factor diagram ultimately couples the photon to the quarks through a dressed quark - photon vertex , this is the microscopic origin of the timelike resonance structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : timelike - ffs-1 ] .",
    "( in rainbow - ladder @xmath1 and @xmath8 are bound states without a width , hence one obtains a series of poles instead of bumps . )",
    "r0.35        apparently there is a deep underlying connection between the ingredients of these equations .",
    "[ fig : dse - bse ] also makes clear that one can not insert a crossed - ladder term without a consistent quark - gluon vertex ; one can not add a confinement potential or drop spin - orbit terms by hand ; etc .",
    "although in principle one is equipped with an exact set of equations , in practice one has to make concessions due to the complexity of the problem : at any stage one could employ model anstze instead of self - consistent solutions , but approximations or truncations can be chosen so that all symmetries are maintained throughout .    whereas the applicability of rainbow - ladder in the light - meson sector is mainly limited to pseudoscalar and vector mesons , baryons fare much better :",
    "the approach reproduces the octet and decuplet ground state masses within @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : masses ] shows results for the @xmath15meson , nucleon and @xmath2 masses as functions of @xmath16 ( which is also calculated ) compared to lattice data and experiment .",
    "the only input is the quark - gluon interaction whose model dependence is given by the bands .",
    "in particular , once the model scale is set to reproduce the pion decay constant , there are no further parameters or approximations and all subsequent results are predictions .    apart from mass spectra , a range of form factors have been calculated as well within this setup . among them",
    "are nucleon , @xmath2 and hyperon electromagnetic form factors , the @xmath17 transition , and nucleon axial form factors ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "all these cases exhibit good overall agreement with experimental data ( where available ) and also lattice results at larger pion masses , with discrepancies at low @xmath18 where pion - cloud effects become important .",
    "we emphasize that the three - body faddeev approach does not depend on explicit diquark degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption of dominant quark - quark correlations inside baryons is quite natural , and it can contribute much to our understanding and interpretation of nucleon transition form factors . in the following",
    "we will therefore review the properties of diquarks and discuss the diquark composition of nucleon resonances .",
    "diquarks are not observable because they carry color .",
    "nevertheless , there are several observations that support a quark - diquark interpretation of baryons .",
    "first , the presumably leading irreducible three - body force ( the three - gluon vertex that connects three quarks ) vanishes simply due the color traces  @xcite , which suggests that two - quark correlations are more important .",
    "second , the interaction between two quarks is attractive in the color-@xmath19 channel . neglecting three - body terms , the faddeev equation in fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] can be rewritten in a more familiar form that depends on the @xmath20 scattering matrix .",
    "assuming that the latter is separable and can be approximated by a sum over diquark correlations , the faddeev equation simplifies to a two - body problem  the quark - diquark bse in fig .",
    "[ fig : quark - diquark ] .",
    "the baryon is then bound by quark exchange ; gluons no longer appear explicitly but they are rather absorbed into the building blocks : the quark propagator , diquark amplitudes and diquark propagators .",
    "the electromagnetic current is constructed accordingly  @xcite .",
    "scalar and axialvector diquarks are the lightest ones , hence they are most important for describing the positive - parity nucleon and @xmath2 baryons .",
    "diquark masses have been calculated in rainbow - ladder  @xcite which produces actual diquark poles in the @xmath20 scattering matrix .",
    "although their appearance is presumably a truncation artifact  @xcite , it still suggests the presence of strong diquark correlations and allows one to compute diquark properties in close analogy to those of mesons from their bses .",
    "quark - diquark models yield results for a range of baryon properties that are indeed similar to those obtained from the three - body equation .",
    "there are essentially three variants of the approach that have been pursued in recent studies .",
    "one is the njl / contact - interaction model from where qualitative statements and overall properties of the baryon spectrum have been extracted  @xcite .",
    "another is the qcd - based model developed in  @xcite which implements more realistic models for the propagators , amplitudes and vertices and thereby also allows one to make quantitative predictions for form factors , such as in a recent calculation of the nucleon to roper transition  @xcite .    here",
    "we will revisit and extend a third variant of the model , namely the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite which is outlined in fig .  [",
    "fig : quark - diquark ] . in that case",
    "the model input is replaced by dse and bse solutions , which provide a direct link to the microscopic building blocks since any modification in the fundamental quark - gluon interaction induces consistent changes up to the observables of interest .",
    "the calculated nucleon and @xmath2 masses in that setup are indeed comparable to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] . as an example we quote the @xmath21 calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndg ] . the calculated form factor ratios @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 agree rather well with the experimental data , which can be partially traced to the presence of relativistic @xmath24 waves in the nucleon and @xmath2 amplitudes . on the other hand , the magnetic dipole form factor agrees with experiment only above @xmath25 gev@xmath26 and deviates by @xmath27 at @xmath28 , presumably due to missing pion - cloud effects .",
    "so far the approach has been applied to nucleon and @xmath2 ground state properties , also including their elastic form factors and the @xmath29 decay  @xcite .",
    "what are then the necessary steps to calculate negative - parity resonances such as the @xmath30 and @xmath31 ?",
    "let us first collect some properties of the diquarks .",
    "diquarks are subject to the pauli principle , so they must be totally antisymmetric under quark exchange .",
    "concerning isospin , the diquark flavor wave functions are either antisymmetric ( @xmath32 ) or symmetric ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "since color is antisymmetric , the corresponding dirac parts must be either antisymmetric ( @xmath32 ) or symmetric ( @xmath33 ) as well . denoting the total onshell momentum by @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the respective diquark mass ) and the relative momentum by @xmath37 , this entails @xmath38   \\gamma^t(-q , p ) & \\dots & i=1 \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] for the dirac parts of the @xmath39 diquark amplitudes , where @xmath40 is a matrix transpose .",
    "the same relations hold for the @xmath41 amplitudes with the replacement @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to the classification in table  [ tab : diquarks ] , where we display the two leading ( s - wave ) tensor structures for each case .",
    "the @xmath43 amplitudes depend on four tensors and the @xmath44 amplitudes on eight , but the remaining tensor components are suppressed because they carry relative momentum and thus higher orbital angular momentum .",
    "the two isospin states must differ by @xmath45 to ensure the correct symmetry ( the dressing functions are all even in @xmath8 ) and the appearance of @xmath8 induces further suppression .    one can draw a close analogy between diquarks and mesons : each diquark amplitude can be mapped onto a respective meson by removing the charge - conjugation matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the upper and lower entries in table  [ tab : diquarks ] then correspond to opposite c - parities for mesons . after taking traces ,",
    "the rainbow - ladder bses for diquarks only differ by a factor 2 from their meson parity partners  diquarks are ` less bound ' than mesons .",
    "the scalar diquarks are the lightest ones ( @xmath47 mev ) , followed by axialvector ( @xmath48  gev ) , pseudoscalar and vector diquarks .",
    "the meson analogues of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are exotic and therefore the respective diquark masses are larger .",
    "in contrast to their meson counterparts , diquarks are rather sensitive to the quark - gluon interaction : in table  [ tab : diquarks ] we quote the central values for the model employed herein but the masses can vary by @xmath52 mev in both directions  @xcite .",
    "there is another consequence of the diquark - meson analogy : whereas pseudoscalar and vector mesons are well described in rainbow - ladder , scalar and axialvector mesons come out too light  @xcite  which can be remedied with more sophisticated truncations  @xcite .",
    "hence , the pseudoscalar and vector diquarks should inherit this behavior and produce negative - parity baryons that are also too light and acquire repulsive shifts beyond rainbow - ladder  @xcite .",

    "moreover , baryons with @xmath56 should be dominated by @xmath57 diquarks because those with @xmath58 require orbital angular momentum ; and positive / negative - parity baryons should be dominated by positive / negative - parity diquarks .",
