    "astrophysical jets are one of the most poorly understood phenomena today .",
    "it is clear that they are present where gravitational accretion or contraction and magnetic fields exist .",
    "we observe these jets in quasars and microquasars due to supermassive and stellar size black holes , respectively .",
    "they are also present in contracting protostars .",
    "perhaps , understanding the mechanism responsible for jets appearing from the energy source of black holes , where the gravitational field is dominant , we can understand their appearences associtated with photostars . at present",
    "there are two popular trains of thought associated with jets in black holes : one is that the jets are inherent properties of geodesic trajectories in the kerr @xcite metric of a rotating black hole , and thus , can be described by einstein s general theory of relativity ; and the other is that the accretion disk and its magnetic field through magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) are producing the jets .",
    "perhaps it could be a combination of the two , with gravity controlling the flow near the event horizon , and mhd controlling the flow at distances farther away . in this paper , an anaylsis of the penrose mechanism @xcite is presented to describe gravitational - particle interactions close to the event horizon in the subparsec regime . in this fully general relativistic description ,",
    "the jets are produced and controlled by gravity alone , without the necessity of an external magnetic field .",
    "the model consists of a supermassive @xmath3 kerr ( rotating ) black hole plus particles from an assumed relativistic bistable thin disk / ion corona [ or torus @xmath2 advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ] : two - temperature [ separate temperatures for protons ( @xmath4  k ) and electrons ( @xmath5  k ) ] accretion flow .",
    "the penrose mechanism is used to extract rotational energy - momentum by scattering processes inside the ergosphere ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) .",
    "see williams @xcite for a detailed description of the model .",
    "the `` quasi - penrose '' processes investigated are ( a ) penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) of equatorial low energy radially infalling photons by equatorially confined ( @xmath8 ) and nonequatorially confined ( @xmath9 ) orbiting target electrons , at radii between the marginally bound ( @xmath10 ) and marginally stable ( @xmath11 ) orbits ; ( b ) penrose pair production ( ppp ) ( ) at @xmath12 ; ( c ) ppp ( ) by equatorial low energy radially infalling photons and high energy blueshifted ( by factor @xmath13 ) nonequatorially confined @xmath14-rays at the _ photon orbit _ ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note , the target particles are initially in bound ( marginally stable or unstable ) trapped orbits , trapped in the sense of possibly having no other way of escaping save these penrose processes @xcite .",
    "note also that , as the nonequatorially confined target particle passes through the equatorial plane , @xmath16 , a constant of motion as measured by an observer at infinity @xcite , equals @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the polar coordinate momentum of the particle .",
    "monte carlo computer simulations of up to @xmath19 scattering events of infalling accretion disk photons ( normalized to a power - law distribution ) are executed for each quasar .",
    "energy and momentum ( i.e. , 4-momentum ) spectra of escaping particles ( @xmath14 s , @xmath20 s ) , as measured by an observer at infinity , are obtained ( where @xmath14 @xmath2 a general photon , i.e. , of any energy value ) .",
    "the following ingredients are used : ( 1 ) general relativity [ the kerr metric spacetime geometry yields equatorially and nonequatorially confined ( `` spherical - like '' @xcite ) particle orbits and escape conditions , conserved energy and angular momentum parameters , and transformations from the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ( blf ) to the local nonrotating frame ( lnrf ) ] . note , blf is the observer at infinity @xcite ; lnrf is the local minkowski ( flat ) spacetime .",
    "( 2 ) special relativity [ in the lnrf , physical processes ( i.e. , the scatterings ) are done ; lorentz transformations between inertial frames are performed ; and lorentz invariant laws are applied ] .",
    "( 3 ) cross sections [ application of the monte carlo method to the cross sections , in the electron rest frame for pcs , in the proton rest frame for ppp ( ) , and in the center of momentum frame for ppp ( ) , give the distributions of scattering angles and final energies ] .",
    "the energies attained are the following : ( 1 ) _ pcs _ : for the input ( photon ) energy range 5 ev to 1 mev , the corresponding output energy range is @xmath21 15 kev to 14 mev .",
    "( 2 ) _ ppp _ ( ): no escaping pairs for radially infalling @xmath14-rays ( @xmath2140 mev ) , and no energy boost : implying that the assumption ( negligible recoil energy given to the proton ) made in the conventional cross section and , perhaps , the geometry of the scattering must be modified . it had been predicted @xcite that pairs with energies ( @xmath221 gev ) can escape .",
    "( 3 ) _ ppp _ ( ): for input ( photon ) energy range @xmath21 3.5 kev to 100 mev , yields output ( @xmath20 ) energy range @xmath21 2 mev to 10 gev ( for bb ) , and higher up to @xmath21 54 gev ( for pl , input @xmath23  gev ) , where bb , pl@xmath24blackbody and power - law distributions , respectively , for the accretion disk protons that yield the neutral pion decays @xmath25 @xcite to populate the photon orbit .",
    "the luminosity spectrum due to penrose processes for the specific case of quasar 3c  273 is plotted in figure  1(a ) , along with the observed spectrum for comparison . the outgoing ( escaping ) luminosity spectrum produced by the penrose scattered particles",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cosmological distance of the black hole source ; @xmath28 is the flux of escaping photons ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the emittance of incoming and captured photons , respectively ; @xmath31 defines the total fraction of the particles that undergoes scattering [ @xmath32 for pcs and @xmath33 for ppp ( ) ] .",
    "the values of @xmath34 are the fitting factors , which make the penrose calculated luminosities agree with observations for the specific case of 3c  273 .",
    "note , in the model calculations , if we let every particle scatter , and set @xmath35 , defining the fraction of the disk luminosity intersecting the scattering regime , with the remaining @xmath31 s equal 1 , the continuum emissions ( the top curves on figures  1(a ) , labeled with numbers for specific cases of target and incident particles ) are obtained ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the spectrum resulting from the ppp ( ) is produced by letting the escaping pairs undergo `` secondary penrose compton scattering '' with low energy radially infalling accretion disk photons ( @xmath36 ) .    thus , as one can see from figure  1(a ) , the penrose mechanism can generate the necessary luminosity observed , and the three model calculated regions of emission [ due to pcs by equatorial confined targets ( curve passing through nos .",
    "@xmath37 ) , by nonequatorially confined targets that cross the equatorial plane ( curve passing through nos .",
    "@xmath38 ) , and ppp ( ) ( curve passing nos .",
    "@xmath39 ) ] are consistent with the three major regions of emission in all quasars and agns .",
    "note , the target photons at the photon orbit can only exist in nonequatorially confined orbits @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observed spectra of microquasars ( or galactic black holes ) , in general , appear not to have pcs emission by the nonequatorially confined target electrons , as well as the highest energy @xmath14-ray emission due to ppp ( ) , indicating that these sources may not have an ion corona nor adaf , which would be need to populate the orbits to generate such emission .",
    "the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force field is the gravitational analog of a magnetic field .",
    "it is the additional gravitational force that a rotating mass produces on a test particle .",
    "the gm force is produced by the gradient of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the frame dragging velocity and @xmath42 is gravitomagnetic potential @xcite .",
    "analysis of the equations governing the trajectories of the particles shows that the gm force , which acts proportional to the momentum of a particle , alters the incoming and outgoing momentum parameters of the incident and scattered particles , resulting in asymmetrical distributions , thus , appearing to break the reflection symmetry of the kerr metric above and below the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "effects of the gm force acting on the ppp ( ) process can be discerned from figures  1(d ) , 1(e ) , and  2 .",
    "note , only the distribution for @xmath43 is shown in figure  1 . when half of the 2000 target photons are allowed to have @xmath43 and the other half @xmath44 of equal absolute values ,",
    "the @xmath20 `` jet / counter - jet '' achieve a maximum ratio @xmath45 , favoring @xmath46 @xcite , as seen in figure  2 .",
    "polar coordinate momentum distributions , @xmath47 , for pcs escaping photons are displayed in figure  3 .",
    "notice the effects of the gm force field causing the photon jet / counter - jet to vary from nearly symmetric to asymmetric for the different cases shown . of these cases",
    "the largest ratio achieved is @xmath48 [ fig .",
    "the direct cause of the asymmetry in the polar direction appears to be due to the severe frame dragging in the ergosphere in which the gm field lines are dragged in the direction that the black hole is rotating @xcite .",
    "it is found that the penrose scattered particles escape along vortical trajectories collimated about the polar axis @xcite .",
    "these distributions are fluxes of coil - like trajectories of relativistic jet particles escaping concentric the polar axis .",
    "the highest energy escaping particles have the largest @xmath49 values , the near largest @xmath18 values , and smallest @xmath50 values .",
    "note , @xmath51 is negative ( inward toward the polar axis ) for most of the pcs photons , and positive for the @xmath20 pairs . the helical angles of escape @xmath52 of particle type @xmath53 , for the highest energy scattered particles are @xmath54 for pcs and @xmath55 for the @xmath20 pairs",
    ". the above characteristics of the escaping particles imply strong collimation about the polar axis , giving rise to relativistic jets with particle velocities up to @xmath56 [ eg .  cf .",
    "1(b ) , 1(c ) , 1(f ) , and  2 ] .",
    "note , such vortical trajectories and collimation are consistent with the findings of de  felice et  al . from spacetime",
    "geometrical studies of general particle geodesics in a kerr metric @xcite .",
    "from this model to extract energy - momentum from a black hole we can conclude the following : pcs is an effective way to boost soft x - rays to hard x - rays and @xmath14-rays up to @xmath21 14  mev .",
    "ppp ( ) is an effective way to produce relativistic @xmath20 pairs up to @xmath21 54  gev : this is the probable mechanism producing the fluxes of relativistic pairs emerging from cores of agns .",
    "these penrose processes can operate for any size rotating black hole , from quasars to microquasars @xcite .",
    "overall , the main features of quasars : ( a ) high energy particles ( x - rays , @xmath20 pairs , @xmath14-rays ) coming from the central source ; ( b ) large luminosities ; ( c ) collimated jets ; ( d ) one - sided ( or uneven jets ) , can all be explained by these penrose processes to extract energy from a black hole .",
    "moreover , it is shown here that the geodesic treatment of individual particle processes close to the event horizon in the subparsec regime , as governed by the black hole , is sufficient to described the motion of the particles .",
    "this finding is consistent with mhd through the statement made by de felice and zanotti @xcite , that the behavior of such individual particles on geometry ( or gravity)-induced collimated trajectories is also that of the bulk of fluid elements in the guiding center approximation . in light of this",
    ", mhd should be incorporated into these calculations to describe the flow of the penrose escaping particles away from the black hole , i.e. , to perhaps further collimate and accelerate these jet particles out to the observed kpc distances .",
