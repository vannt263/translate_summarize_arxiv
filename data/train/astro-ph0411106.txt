    "the golden  60s , together with the cosmic microwave background and the pulsars , witnessed the discovery of other two important classes of sources : gamma  ray bursts and blazars ( i.e. bl lacertae objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ) .",
    "grb are flashes of @xmath0ray radiation , likely flagging the birth of a stellar size black hole , while radio  loud agns , even if remarkable for their rapid variability , live for hundreds millions years , producing spectacular and mpc  size jets and radio lobes , and are powered by supermassive ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) black holes .",
    "this apparent diversity should not outshine some remarkable similarities , since in both classes the emitting plasma is moving at relativistic bulk speeds , and the radiation we see is likely the result of the transformation of part of this well ordered kinetic energy into random energy and then into radiation .",
    "furthermore , there are strong evidences that also gbrs have collimated jets .",
    "very different at first sight , grbs and blazars might be powered by a similar machine .",
    "consider also that the dynamical timescale for a grb should be of the order of the light travel time to cross the gravitational radius , i.e. @xmath3 seconds . a burst with a duration of 10 seconds therefore lasts for @xmath1 dynamical times : it can be a quasi steady process ( for a @xmath4 solar mass black hole , this time is equivalenth to 300 years ) .",
    "what we naively consider an  explosion \" is instead a long event .    in both classes of sources we see",
    "non  thermal radiation and it is therefore likely that magnetic field and non  thermal particles are the key ingredients to produce the radiation we see .",
    "this radiation , being produced by plasma in relativistic motion , is strongly beamed in the velocity direction , and we have evidences that also in grbs the emitting fireball is collimated in a cone , i.e. a  jet \" . for these reasons it is instructive to compare them looking for similarities and differences , to see if their physics is similar . in",
    "the following i will briefly discuss some of the basic facts of blazars and grbs , and discuss the possibility that , at the origin of their phenomenology , there is a common engine .",
    "being so powerful , blazars and grbs are well visible even at redshifts greater than 6 , and we can use them as probes of the far universe . in the case of grbs , we can even _ measure _ the universe , thanks to a recently found correlation between their properties which enable us to use them as standard candles .",
    "soon after the achievement of the vlbi technology , in the early  70s , 3c 279 and 3c 273 were discovered to have spots of radio emission moving away from the nucleous at the apparent speed of @xmath510 .",
    "this was one of the few dramatic features in astronomy which were anticipated by theory ( rees 1966 ) , and it is the result of real motion at velocities close to @xmath6 , observed at small , albeit not vanishingly small , viewing angles .",
    "the corresponding bulk lorentz factors @xmath7 are greater or equal than @xmath8 , and today superluminal speeds are routinely measured in almost all ( and the exception are important ) blazars .",
    "it is diffucult to assign an upper limit to the inferred distribution of @xmath7 , but it is believed that in powerful blazars ( showing relatively strong broad emission lines , as in radio  quiet agns ) , the range is @xmath9 , with some remaining uncertainty associated with the phenomenon of intraday variability in radio , leading to huge brightness temperatures ( see wagner & witzel 1995 for a review ) .",
    "this is now explained by the effect interstellar scintillation , but a source scintillates if its angular size is small , suggesting in any case very high brightness temperatures , even if not so extreme , requiring large @xmath7 in any case ( e.g. kedziora  chudczer et al .",
    "furthermore , at the other hand of the power scale , models of tev bl lacs seem to require @xmath7 up to @xmath1050 or so , to explain their tev emission , especially when their @xmath0ray spectrum is  de  absorbed \" , i.e. when the depletion of tev photons interacting with the ir cosmic background is taken into account ( e.g. krawczynski , coppi & aharonian 2002 ; konopelko et al .",
    "interestingly , vlbi and space vlbi observations of these tev bl lacs have revealed that their apparent speed at the submas scale ( @xmath101 pc ) is only moderately superluminal or even subluminal ( piner & edwards 2004 ; giroletti et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this of course opens the issue of strong deceleration from tev emitting region ( @xmath11 cm from the center ) to 1 pc ( kazanas & georganopoulos 2003 , ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2004 ) .    from the beginning ,",
    "the plasma moving inside the jets was assumed to have a monodirectional velocity , despite the conical geometry of the jet itself .",
    "there have been sporadic attempts to see what happens if the velocity vectors are distributed in a fan  like geometry (  sprayed \" , celotti et al .",
    "1993 ) , but this possibility has not been followed in any detail . instead , there is some suggestions that the jet may have a velocity structure ( but still monodirectional ) , with a fast spine and a slow layer ( e.g. laing 1993 ; chiaberge et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ; ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2004 ) , at least in low power ( and tev emitting ) bl lacs and in their misaligned counterpart , i.e. fr i radiogalaxies .",
    "we do not see  jets \" in grbs , but we nevertheless believe that their emission originates from plasma moving with @xmath12 , making them the speed record holders among all known sources .",
    "there are essentially three arguments suggesting such large speeds :    1 .",
    "we see variability on timescales 1100 ms , powers @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 and spectra extending above 511 kev , the threshold for @xmath0@xmath15 .",
    "if the source is not moving the optical depth for the photon  photon process is of the order of @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "relativistic bulk motion comes to the rescue by allowing much larger sizes of the emitting region than inferred from variability , much smaller intrinsic powers , and much less photons above threshold .",
    "2 .   variability . to produce the radiation we see",
    ", the source can not be as small as inferred from the observed variability , since the required leptons would make the source compton or thomson thick for scattering .",
    "again , a large @xmath7 is required .",
    "3 .   theory .",
    "a huge amount of energy put in a small volume in a short time generates a small big  bang : @xmath18@xmath19 pairs are immediately created , the source becomes istantaneously thick and expands , pushed by its internal pressure , to become relativistic .",
    "this is the _ fireball _ ( cavallo & rees 1978 ) .    at first , fireballs were thought to be spherically symmetric , with radial velocities .",
    "now there are strong indications that they are collimated into cones ( or flying pancakes ) of some aperture angle @xmath20 .",
    "these angles are of the same order of blazar s jets , but in grbs studies the  sprayed nature of the velocities has been mantained in almost all models of grbs ( with the exception of the cannonball model ; e.g. dar & de rjula , 2003 ) .",
    "the spectra ( sed ) of blazars are characterized by two broad emission peaks , believed to be produced in the same zone of the jet ( at some hundreds of schwarzchild radii from the base ) by the synchrotron and inverse compton procesess ( but there are alternative views , see e.g. mucke et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the sed is controlled by the bolometric observed luminosity , with both peaks shifting at smaller frequencies when the luminosity increases ( see fig .",
    "[ sequence ] , left ) .",
    "furthermore , the dominance of the high energy peak increases when increasing the bolometric luminosity ( but this latter inference was based on the few low power bl lacs detected by egret ) .",
    "blazar sequence _ can be explained by a different degree of radiative cooling : in powerful blazars electrons cool faster , producing a break in the electron distribution function at smaller and smaller energies when increasing the total ( radiation plus magnetic ) energy density in the comoving frame ( ghisellini et al . 1998 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for illustration , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cosmo ] shows the constraints in the @xmath21@xmath22 plane , when assuming a time dependent equation of state of the dark energy , of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pressure and the energy density of the dark energy .",
    "if the dark energy is described by the classical @xmath26 cosmological term , then we must have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "again , note that although grbs alone are not very constraining , the combined fit of grb+sn ia moves the 68% confidence region to embrace the @xmath27 , @xmath28 point .",
    "an obvious advantage from using grbs for cosmology is that we can detect them up to redhisft 10 or 20 , contrary to sn ia , detectable up to @xmath29 .",
    "the other point in favor is that grbs are virtually unaffected by dust or lyman @xmath30 absorption . finally ,",
    "if the ghirlanda correlation is obeyed by grbs of any luminosity , it is evolution  independent .",
    "the swift satellite is expected to localize 100150 bursts per year .",
    "for the majority of them we foresee to have redshifts and well sampled afterglow lightcurves , allowing the most optimistic expectations for doing cosmology with grbs .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank a. celotti , c. firmani , g. ghirlanda , d. lazzati and f. tavecchio for many helpful discussions and a fruitful collaboration .",
