    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are important phenomena in shaping the metal enrichment history of the universe , excellent tools for probing its expansion history @xcite , and they also provide a unique laboratory to study combustion physics , hydrodynamics , plus nuclear and atomic processes .",
    "sn  2005cg can shed light on a number of questions involving the physics of supernovae and their use in cosmology .",
    "the host is a low - luminosity galaxy , raising the possibility of a low metallicity for the sn progenitor , and the galaxy colors suggest a substantial population of young stars .",
    "line profiles of constrain the chemical structure of the outer layers and provide a test for nuclear burning models .",
    "the most favored models for sne  ia involve a white dwarf ( wd ) near the chandrasekhar mass accreting matter from a binary companion , which eventually results in a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "one of the key questions of physics is how the burning front propagates : whether it remains a subsonic deflagration front , or turns into a weak detonation as in the so - called delayed detonation ( dd ) models .",
    "a key difference between these possibilities is the velocity range of the explosion products . in deflagration models",
    "the outer layers of the envelope expand with velocities close to the sound speed @xcite and , by causality , the subsonic deflagration can not keep up .",
    "thus the outer layers remain unburned c / o .",
    "in contrast , nearly the entire wd undergoes burning in delayed detonation models , at least for normal - bright sne  ia .",
    "the structures of the classical deflagration model w7 and delayed detonation models are very similar inside the region of incomplete si burning where the spectra at maximum light are formed , but they are very different in the outer layers responsible for line formation at very early times",
    ". for recent reviews on sne  ia , see @xcite .",
    "high - velocity ( hv ) has been found to be a common feature in sne  ia ( e.g. sn  1994d ; @xcite ; sn  1999ee ; @xcite ; sn  2000cx ; @xcite ; sn  2001el ; @xcite ; sn  2003du ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that this feature in sn  2001el was kinematically distinct from the photospheric ir triplet and suggested it could be a consequence of nuclear burning in the wd ( perhaps during the deflagration to detonation transition ) , which causes the ejection of a high - velocity , ca - rich filament , or that it might be attributed to the surrounding accretion disk , which has undergone nuclear burning to increase the ca abundance .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of the hv feature based on detailed nlte - models that included interaction with circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "they showed that the hv feature and its evolution with time could be understood in the framework of the interaction of the ejecta with a circumstellar shell of solar composition .",
    "they predicted a corresponding blue cutoff in the absorption feature that should be visible at early times .",
    "in this paper we discuss sn  2005cg , a normal sn  ia discovered by the wide field rotse - iii sky patrol search @xcite . in  [ obs ] we give the early broad - band rotse - iiic light curve and spectral evolution recorded by the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "we discuss constraints on explosion models from the line profile in  [ siii ] and give an interpretation of the hv feature in  [ csm ] . in ",
    "[ host ] we discuss properties of the host galaxy and its implications for the progenitor . in ",
    "[ other ] , sn  2005cg is put into context with other sne  ia .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "sn  2005cg was discovered on 2005 june 1 ( ut ) at about 18.0 magnitude using the 0.45 m rotse - iiic telescope at the high - energy stereoscopic systems site in namibia @xcite .",
    "the supernova is located at @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "daily follow - up observations with rotse - iiic since discovery give the unfiltered broad - band light curve shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "we processed the data with a customized version of the daophot psf - fitting package @xcite ported to idl by @xcite . the magnitude zero - point for each image",
    "was calculated from the median offset of fiducial reference stars to the sdss @xmath6-band values @xcite . to determine the date of maximum light",
    ", we fit the sn  ia r - band template of @xcite to our data , where the phases are relative to the b - band maximum .",
    "the best fit puts the maximum on june 13.4 with a formal error of @xmath70.1 days , and shows that sn  2005cg is a normal sn  ia .",
    "we obtained a low resolution ( r@xmath8300 ) optical spectrum using the marcario low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; @xcite ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; @xcite ) on 2005 june 3 , which showed sn  2005cg to be a type ia supernova @xcite .",
    "the effective wavelength range is 4100 - 7800for these data and for a second het / lrs spectrum taken on 2005 june 4 ; at longer wavelengths order - overlap begins to contaminate the spectrum . for subsequent spectral observations we used an og515 blocking filter , giving an effective coverage of 5150 - 10000 .",
    "we used the standard star wolf1346 @xcite , observed with both setups on 2005 june 4 , to perform relative spectrophotometric calibration and to correct for telluric absorption .",
    "the spectral evolution of sn  2005cg is presented in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the host galaxy of sn  2005cg was observed prior to the explosion by the sloan digital sky survey and designated sdss j211050.45 + 001206.7 @xcite .",
    "the host has a @xmath9 magnitude of @xmath10 and a petrosian radius of @xmath11 . identifying narrow emission features in the het spectra at 6768 , 5013 , and 5165  as h - alpha , h - beta , and [ ] 5007 , respectively",
    ", we derive a redshift of @xmath12 .",
    "the first two spectra of sn  2005cg obtained about 9 and 10 days before maximum , respectively , reveal an asymmetric `` triangular - shaped '' absorption profile characterized by an approximately linear ( in log flux ) slope of the line wings and an extended blue wing .",
    "there is also a sharp break in slope or `` cutoff '' between the blue wing of the line and the continuum . in subsequent spectra ( 4 days before maximum and later )",
    "the profile becomes more curved and symmetric .",
    "although this time dependence has been observed previously ( see  [ other ] ) and indeed is predicted by delayed detonation models @xcite , the implications have mostly been ignored . in sn  2005cg",
    ", the blue wing of the in the two earliest spectra extends out to 24,000 to 25,000 km s@xmath2 ; this requires a significant si abundance in the outer most layers .",
    "thus , the si abundance must not decline too rapidly with radius and hence velocity .",
    "the dd models depicted in figure  [ model ] naturally give an extended distribution of si and line profiles that approximate the early observations .",
    "for comparison , we also give the line profile assuming that no burning took place above velocities of 15,000 km s@xmath2 corresponding to the deflagration model w7 @xcite ; this profile lacks the extended blue si wing .",
    "outward mixing of si has been suggested as a means to provide higher velocity @xcite . in principle , mixing properties of deflagration models may be tuned to reproduce chemical profiles similar to dd models ; however , the composition of high - velocity mixed matter would consist of explosive oxygen burning products , namely si and s , and lack explosive carbon burning products , such as mg .",
    "typically , sne  ia show strong lines in the near ir at high velocities that require a mg abundance of a few percent , consistent with layers undergoing explosive carbon burning ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in models ,",
    "the triangular shape of the profile requires the line formation to take place in a region of si concentration that declines faster with distance than the density slope .",
    "the profile is linear in log flux if the abundance logarithm declines linearly with velocity , and its extent in velocity space is linked to the abundance if the effective optical depth is small . at very early times",
    "when the effective optical depth is large close to the absorption trough , the linear profile would be to the blue of a `` round absorption core . '' at later times the highest velocity material has thinned , thus the model spectra show deeper layers of the explosion and probe a more restricted region of velocity space due to the more shallow velocity gradient . during these phases ,",
    "the classic `` 6150 '' profile is seen with a gentle roll over on the blue wing as it meets with the continuum .",
    "the early spectra of sn  2005cg show strong absorption around 7900 , which we attribute to high velocity ( 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) .",
    "this feature is common to most , if not all , sne  ia observed before maximum light in the appropriate wavelength range @xcite .",
    "@xcite credit this absorption to a surrounding ( @xmath13 cm ) region of hydrogen - rich material , possibly from an accretion disk , roche lobe , or common envelope , swept up by the outer layers of the sn ejecta .",
    "@xcite find an upper limit of 0.03 m@xmath14 for solar abundance material present within the sn  2001el explosion site , which is consistent with the 0.02 m@xmath14 derived by @xcite for sn  2003du .",
    "both papers rule out a continuous wind extending beyond @xmath15 cm .    since burning a given mass of c / o to si or to heavier elements releases",
    "roughly the same amount of energy , the velocity of the outer layers of the sn ejecta will remain approximately constant for a variety of explosion models provided the chandrasekhar mass wd is completely burned . following @xcite , we can therefore determine the mass of circumstellar material ( csm ) swept into the shell simply by requiring momentum conservation . with this and a polytropic density gradient for the wd",
    ", we can then find @xmath16 by measuring the shell velocity from the hv line profile .",
    "figure  [ line_vel ] shows the and line profiles from the june 4 spectrum of sn  2005cg plotted in velocity space relative to 6355  and 8567 , respectively .",
    "these wavelengths represent the average of the doublet and triplet lines respectively weighted by their @xmath17 values .",
    "the shell velocity is @xmath823,000 km s@xmath2 measured from the minimum of the hv , giving 5 to 7 @xmath18 m@xmath14 of the csm accumulated in the shell .",
    "the absorption profile can be understood in the framework of dd models ( see  [ siii ] ) but neglecting csm interaction the wings are expected to extend to @xmath19 km s@xmath2 ( figure  [ model ] ) . with an interacting shell , the outer sn ejecta are slowed down . for sn  2005cg , the blue wing of the absorption terminates abruptly at @xmath824,000 km s@xmath2 ( figure  [ line_vel ] ) .",
    "we interpret this cutoff as a truncation in the velocity distribution created when the outer ejecta layers are decelerated as they interact with the csm .",
    "the changing optical depth of the thinning shell will move the apparent hv minimum to the red with time .",
    "even so , the coincidence of the si cutoff with the blue edge of the hv minimum seen in figure  [ line_vel ] supports the interpretation that the si cutoff is caused by the csm shell .",
    "we note there is a slight dip in the line profile near the cutoff velocity .",
    "while this may simply be due to absorption , it is possible this is a signature of the si produced in the outer layers of the explosion piling up in the shell .",
    "the host of sn  2005cg is a low - mass dwarf galaxy in a filament or merging group environment ( figure  [ cluster ] ) , raising some interesting questions about sne  ia progenitors and the properties of high-@xmath20 sne  ia . using the calibrations of @xcite and references therein , the host galaxy has @xmath21 color 1.27 , luminosity @xmath22 , half - light radius @xmath23 @xmath8 0.6 kpc , stellar mass @xmath8 4@xmath24@xmath25 m@xmath14 , and atomic - gas  to  stellar mass ratio @xmath8 1:1 ( with factor of 2 - 3 uncertainty on the latter two ) . from the tully - fisher relation in @xmath6 , the galaxy s internal velocity is @xmath26 km s@xmath2 , implying a binding energy high enough to avoid gas blow - away @xcite .",
    "nearby analogues with similar colors , masses , and environments display knotty irregular morphology or post - interaction distortions ( based on the nearby field galaxy survey , @xcite ; environments computed following @xcite ) . among analogues with similarly compact radii ,",
    "most systems have blue - centered color gradients and strong star formation ( ew(h@xmath27 ) @xmath8 25200 ) , suggesting starburst activity .",
    "gas metallicities are subsolar ( log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.58.8 ) and 21-cm data yield high gas - to - stellar mass ratios @xmath80.51 .",
    "we infer that the dwarf host of sn  2005cg is likely to have many similarities to high-@xmath20 sn hosts : low mass , high gas content , strong star formation , low metallicity , and perhaps environmental perturbations .",
    "while we can not directly constrain the age of the sn progenitor , a young progenitor is an intriguing possibility @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 photometry of the host galaxy suggests at least two stellar populations , with fits to the models of @xcite generally favoring a 1020% young , solar metallicity population ( 25100 myr ) mixed with a larger intermediate - age metal - poor population ( 640900 myr ) .",
    "however , an underlying 2.55 gyr population is not ruled out .",
    "in fact , most resolved studies of nearby dwarf galaxies have found traces of ancient stellar populations ( e.g. @xcite ) , consistent with a long and bursty star formation history . for the above - mentioned analogues of our sn host , nominal gas consumption timescales range from 2 - 13 gyr , but continuing gas accretion is likely .",
    "a search through the suspect spectral archive reveals that the triangular and the hv features are common to other normal sne  ia around 10 days before maximum light . included in figure  [ line_vel ]",
    "are sn 2003du at -11 days @xcite , sn  1999ee at -9 days @xcite , and sn  1994d at -9 days @xcite . as with sn  2005cg ,",
    "all show a remarkably similar blue wing up to @xmath29 km s@xmath2 with corresponding hv . within our interpretation",
    ", the triangular profiles suggest that all these sn originate from similar explosion conditions .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the recent analysis of photospheric expansion velocities ( @xmath30 ) of @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that all normal - bright sne  ia are the same . in our sample",
    ", sn 1990n at -14 days shows rather `` round '' profiles @xcite .",
    "moreover , sn  1990n shows very high but rapidly declining @xmath30 up to a few days before maximum light , followed by an almost constant @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "both behaviors may be understood in the framework of models that produce shell - like structures as expected in mergers or pulsating delayed detonation models @xcite .",
    "sn  2005cg appears to be a branch - normal sn  ia in terms of its light curve and spectra .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that this normal sn  ia may shed new light on thermonuclear explosions and sn research in general .",
    "rare for low - z sne  ia , the host is a faint , blue galaxy with strong indications for active star formation and an environment comparable to sne  ia at high redshifts . because low mass galaxies tend to be low in metallicity , sn",
    "2005cg is a good candidate to have a low metallicity or young progenitor . as discussed in ",
    "[ host ] , the current results are inconclusive , and we may never know whether sn  2005cg originates from a young or old population .",
    "however , after the sn fades , detailed analysis of the host galaxy should allow us to address the question of metallicity .",
    "if it is low and homogeneous over the galaxy , sn  2005cg may be the new empirical standard for a low metallicity sne  ia .",
    "the second remarkable feature is the method of discovery .",
    "sn  2005cg was discovered in a blind , wide - field transient search by rotse - iii in a galaxy that would not have been targeted in traditional low redshift searches . previously , there has been a difference in the way low and high redshift sne are sampled : high - z sne are discovered in blind searches while low - z sne are found with targeted surveys biased to the larger , more productive host galaxies .",
    "recently , blind wide field searches have been conducted to discover nearby sne in a manner consistent with the high - z searches ( c.f .",
    "snfactory , @xcite ) , netting several sne  ia in low - luminosity hosts including sn  1999aw with its exceptionally faint ( @xmath31 ) host @xcite .",
    "these sne  ia in low luminosity hosts deserve much closer scrutiny .",
    "sn  2005cg draws attention to the importance of line profiles as diagnostic tools . in the early spectra , the 6355",
    "line rises slowly up from the minimum to the blue edge where it sharply meets with the continuum between 24,000 and 25,000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this characteristic is commensurate with dd models that give a slow decrease in production out to the edge of the wd ; however , it is inconsistent with pure deflagration models such as w7 that do not burn the outer layers completely and hence do not predict at velocities above @xmath32 km s@xmath2 . in principle , mixing may produce extended si structures , but this would be inconsistent with features commonly seen in the ir spectra .",
    "sn  2005cg provides additional evidence that we need a detonation phase in sne  ia explosions .",
    "another remarkable feature of sn  2005cg is the presence of a high - velocity component in .",
    "this high - velocity feature can be well understood in the framework of an interaction of the rapidly expanding ejecta with h or he - rich surroundings within the progenitor system @xcite . as predicted , the hv coincides with the high - velocity cutoff in the line .",
    "although this observation supports the model presented by @xcite , circumstellar interaction is not necessarily a unique interpretation .",
    "finally , we compared sn  2005cg in the context of other branch - normal supernovae , and found them strikingly homogeneous in appearance both with respect to the triangular profiles and in the high - velocity cutoffs in si , which are consistent with the hv features . combining our sample with that of gerardy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , doppler shifts indicate csm shell masses in the range between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "alternative interpretations of the high - velocity ( see introduction ) seem to be less satisfactory .",
    "the long - lived nature disfavors interpreting the feature as recombining to @xcite , while the ubiquity disfavors the ejection of a thin ca - rich filament that would only be observed from restricted angles .",
    "moreover , expanding shells are likely to wrap around narrow filaments and thus we would not expect the relation between the cutoff and hv . nonetheless , polarization observed in sn  2001el @xcite requires some sort of asymmetry , and consequently the mass estimates for the shell containing the hv are upper limits which may need to be reduced by factors of 2 to 3 .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the presence of high velocity si is evidence for deflagrations , which we find unlikely : in the ir excludes mixing of a deflagration model ( see  [ siii ] ) and the ubiquity of at high velocities disfavors line of sight effects .",
    "moreover the relation of the cutoff to the hv points to a common origin .    in our sample of early time spectra ,",
    "most of the sne  ia can be understood within the framework of the same model ; however , there is a remarkable exception to the homogeneity with respect to the light curves , early time spectra , and evolution of the velocities : sn  1990n and the similar event sn  2001el @xcite .",
    "this may be regarded as a hint of distinct sne  ia sub - classes and lend support to earlier suggestions attributing this division to different progenitors such as pulsation delayed detonations or mergers @xcite .",
