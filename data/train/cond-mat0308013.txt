    "the market index is driven by numerous players and demand - supply factors through a composite average of various stocks .",
    "these factors constitute the complex market mechanism that causes the price variation in a component stock , which in turn pulls down or pushes up the a market index .",
    "tracking many variables is tricky , making the quantification of economic fluctuations challenging .    a careful analysis of the market forces is required to provide accurate trends and indicators , which form a tool for market forecast and",
    "hence also provide solutions and key inputs for the improvement of economic policies and legislation .",
    "in this paper we investigate stock market asset price variations in a typical developing country such as india and compare the trends with those from economically developed economies .",
    "a textbook study  @xcite of stock price variations suggests that stock prices  and concomitantly , stock price indices  follow a markovian - wiener process .",
    "this means that the stock price on any day is independent of the history of the stock price or its fluctuation .",
    "this results in a conventional log - normal density for stock prices  @xcite , i.e. , the logarithm of the stock price follows a normal density .    however , developed markets such as those in the united states , germany , and japan exhibit a stock price behavior that differs from the gaussian density frequently used in conventional theories .",
    "a key empirical finding in this regard is that the probability density of logarithmic price changes ( returns ) is approximately symmetric and decays with power law tails with identical exponent @xmath8 for both tails  @xcite .",
    "one intriguing aspect of this empirical finding is that it appears to be universal .",
    "individual stocks appear to conform to these laws not just in us markets  @xcite , but also in german  @xcite and australian markets  @xcite .",
    "these same laws are obeyed by market indices such as the s&p 500 , the dow jones , the nikkei , the hang seng , and the milan index  @xcite , and similar behavior is found in commodity markets  @xcite as well as in the most - traded currency exchange rates ( e.g. , the us dollar versus the deutsch mark , or the us dollar versus the japanese yen  @xcite ) .",
    "universal _ nature of these patterns exhibited in the statistics of daily returns is remarkable , since these markets differ greatly in their details .",
    "the observed universality is consistent with a _ scale - independent _ behavior of the underlying dynamics .",
    "here we focus on indian stock market and find an exponential probability density function of price fluctuations , revealing an intrinsic scale . our results",
    "is based on analyzing @xmath9 records representing daily returns for 49 largest stock of the national stock exchange ( nse ) in india over the period nov 1994june 2002 .",
    "we define the normalized price fluctuation ( return ) @xmath10 here @xmath11 day , @xmath12 indexes the 49 stocks , @xmath13 is the price of stock @xmath14 at time @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the standard deviation of @xmath17 .    to compare the probability density function of the indian stocks with us stocks we randomly choose 49 us stocks in the same period .",
    "next we aggregate the data  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig1]a and  [ fig1]b displays the probability density function @xmath4 for both positive and negative tails for the daily returns in a log - log plot .",
    "the us stocks have a power law probability density function with exponent @xmath18 [ cf .",
    "@xcite ] .    figures  [ fig1]c and  [ fig1]d displays the probability density of the aggregated data for both indian and us stocks in a linear - log plot .",
    "we observe that the probability density of the 49 indian stocks has an exponential form of decay @xmath19 with @xmath20",
    "\\\\        1.34 \\pm 0.04 & [ \\mathrm{positive~tail } ]          \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{e.beta1}\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig2 ] displays the estimates of @xmath21 for both positive and negative tails of the probability density function .",
    "we find the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) significance probabilities for the null exponential hypothesis for all 49 indian stocks and for the aggregated data to be @xmath22 .",
    "further we calculate @xmath23 and find @xmath24 \\\\        1.34 \\pm 0.06 & [ \\mathrm{positive~tail } ]",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",

    "approximately @xmath25 of the world s inhabitants live in india . in 2001 india had an estimated impoverished population of 40 million , 22% of the total urban population .",
    "the national stock exchange averages @xmath26 trades per day and its average daily turnover is @xmath27 usd .",
    "the average turnover in india is @xmath28 usd and the average share volume transacted is @xmath29 .",
    "because indian people are traditionally extremely careful with their money , they have a high individual savings and transactions in the indian stock market are not distributed across all economic scales .",
    "stock market transactions are typically carried out by those with wealth in the top 25% of the economic spectrum .",
    "a natural question is why the indian stock market should have statistical properties that differ from other stock markets .",
    "one possible reason can be traced to the history of trading patterns in india and to its persistent trading culture . even after more than 127 years of stock market operations ,",
    "trading in india is said to be based as much on emotional factors as on actual evaluations and quantitative analysis .",
    "quantitative analytical skills , although available , are expensive and limited , so a majority of investors in india tend to follow archaic investment strategies , which they feel are more conservative and safe .",
    "the result is that extreme risk situations with concomitant high returns are completely avoided .",
    "this lack of quantification strategies has also hampered the two year old derivatives market , where even arbitrageurs trade on thumb rules and not actual models , we have witnessed prices where mis - pricing takes hours to correct .",
    "there are very few large financial institutions contributing to the total volume in trade .",
    "small investors drive panic into the market on rumors making the market susceptible to small instabilities . also , until recently , most indian assets were under the control of the state and hence exposed to changes of political administration .",
    "these factors have kept the market under a tight noose .",
    "thus stock price fluctuations in india are intermediate to that between power law behavior and gaussian behavior .",
    "power law behavior is found for highly developed economies while the less highly developed economies such as india follow a behavior which is scale dependent ..    we thank l. a. n. amaral , y.  ashkenazy , x.  gabaix , p.  gopikrishnan , s.  havlin , v.  plerou , a.  schweiger and especially t. lux for helpful discussions and suggestions , and nsf for financial support .",
