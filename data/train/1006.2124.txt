    "the form and function of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite have evolved since the idea s birth . initially , the correspondence was borne from consideration of the decoupling limit of branes in string and m - theory with conformal near - horizon supersymmetries , including the paradigmatic case of duality between type iib supergravity on ads@xmath0 and strongly coupled @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory in the large n limit .",
    "subsequent work relaxed the correspondence to include bulk spacetimes that are asymptotically ads and to those with non - maximal or no supersymmetry .",
    "the last few years have also seen a broadening of the scope of correspondence to include bulk actions that have no origin in string or m - theory : one simply writes down a  bottom - up \" lagrangian that admits an ads vacuum , and asks what sort of field theories it can describe , while tabling questions regarding the quantum existence of the bulk theory .",
    "this has led to a productive interface between ads / cft and condensed matter physics , including constructions of gravity duals to holographic superconductors @xcite , non - relativistic theories with anisotropic lifshitz scaling @xcite , and theories with galilean invariance @xcite , among much other work .",
    "there has also been work on theories with no microscopic scaling symmetry at all , but rather merely relativistic symmetry .",
    "this correspondence @xcite models strongly coupled , poincar - invariant quantum field theories ( possibly with some supersymmetry ) with a bulk spacetime that is , at least asymptotically , of the form @xmath2 along with some number of rolling scalar fields .",
    "this goes by the name",
    " domain wall / qft correspondence\"@xcite .",
    "the fact that the metric ( [ dw1 ] ) is conformal to ads can be phrased as crucial to the duality , which was established by decoupling the near - horizon dynamics of non - conformal d - branes : passage to a conformal , so - called  dual \" frame in which the d - brane near - horizon metric becomes ads@xmath3 reveals a manifest @xmath4-dimensional gravitational description , in which we identify the radial direction with the energy scale of the dual field theory @xcite . because the scalars vary and the curvature is somewhere singular , the duality holds at intermediate energies , away from large curvature and order one effective string coupling .",
    "this picture can be summed up by the statement that these nonconformal d - branes have a ",
    "generalized conformal structure\"@xcite : upon passage to the dual frame , the conformal symmetry of the metric is broken by the nonconstant scalar field , implying that the radial scale transformation leaves the solution invariant if one shifts the scalar field simultaneously .",
    "this follows from the conformal structure of m - theory branes and their relation to ten - dimensional type ii branes .    in @xcite a precise holographic dictionary",
    "was established in this case , both for choices of @xmath5 that derive from branes and those that do not  that is , the program of holographic renormalization was extended to these non - asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "it seems natural then to extend the phenomenological philosophy described above in pursuit of the question ,  what are all ir spacetimes that can be patched onto a domain wall solution ? \"",
    "this dualizes to the question ,  what long - range behavior is possible for systems with merely poincar symmetry ? \"",
    "this approach was utilized in @xcite in the context of hydrodynamics of nonconformal branes , for example , but we would like to continue to study phases of field theories to which dw / qft applies .    in a separate development , we recall that gravity duals of condensed matter systems often have the undesirable feature of nonzero entropy at extremality .",
    "this runs counter to the empirical nernst s  theorem \" , which says that a generic physical system cooled to zero temperature should lose all its entropy as it occupies a unique ground state .",
    "gauge / gravity duality translates this to the statement that we should study finite temperature black holes which have a degenerating horizon as the temperature is tuned to zero , unlike the standard example of the charged reissner - nordstrom black brane .",
    "region of the reissner - nordstrom black hole has also been used constructively , for instance in modeling behavior of ir cfts in 0 + 1 dimensions .",
    "see e.g. @xcite . ]",
    "much work has succeeded in understanding both the nature of low - temperature physics in strongly coupled systems , and the extent to which gravity duals can model the intricacies of the real world .",
    "but we would like to understand this better ; for instance , intuition might suggest that such ground state entropies disappear when generic interactions are turned on , or when introducing a nonzero external field , but these notions have yet to be comprehensively confirmed or rebutted ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we show that these two puzzles  modeling systems with poincar symmetry and understanding the universal aspects of strongly coupled condensed matter systems  find novel intersection . specifically , we consider finite temperature scaling solutions of a theory of gravity coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field and a real , neutral scalar , with a scalar - dependent gauge coupling . in this general form ,",
    "the action resembles various dimensionally - reduced string theory actions .",
    "we make an electric ansatz for the gauge field , so our theory will describe a field theory with finite electric charge density .",
    "explicitly , we examine an action @xmath6 which admits a general scaling solution for the metric , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a near - extremal  emblackening \" factor that vanishes at the near - extremal horizon , @xmath9 , and equals one in the extremal solution ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the field equations demand @xmath11 , so this metric , by design , has zero extremal entropy .",
    "hence , its extremal limit can be viewed as approximating the leading near - horizon behavior of a solution with vanishing horizon area ; that is , as the far infrared gravity dual to a system with a unique zero temperature ground state .",
    "if one insists that this class of metrics is an exact solution of the theory ( [ actionintro ] ) , it can only be supported with rolling scalars of the form @xmath12 moreover , the field equations demand that the scalar potential and gauge coupling are single exponentials in @xmath13 , @xmath14    an action of the form ( [ actionintro ] ) with this exponential potential clearly does not admit ads ; in fact , its flux - less vacuum is a domain wall .",
    "therefore , if the scaling solution ( [ scaling1 ] ) is patched onto an asymptotically domain wall spacetime , then dw / qft holography dualizes the global solution to a relativistic theory with power law thermodynamic scaling at low energies and temperatures .",
    "this interpolating geometry  which we construct numerically  connects the ir spacetime ( [ scaling1 ] ) to the uv spacetime ( [ dw1 ] ) , with electric flux sourcing the ir geometry and a logarithmically rolling scalar accompanying both .    just as the asymptotic domain wall of the global solution is conformal to ads , one can ask whether applying that same weyl transformation to the ir scaling solution reveals any similar generalized symmetry left unbroken by the electric charge .",
    "indeed , we find a conformal frame scale - invariance in the ir metric , so that the near - extremal scaling metric becomes the near - extremal lifshitz solution , @xmath15 modified by a logarithmically rolling scalar ( [ rollingscalar ] ) .",
    "the low - energy physics of our dual field theory , therefore , is controlled by a  generalized scale invariance , \" despite the solution not exhibiting scale invariance in einstein frame .",
    "of course , the invariance is broken by the finite temperature , but it is nonetheless an interesting result , natural in the context of dw / qft : just as the uv domain wall spacetime possesses a generalized conformal structure , the charged , lorentz - symmetry breaking phase to which the theory flows in the ir retains the part of this structure unbroken by the presence of that charge .",
    "four - dimensional holography for the scaling solution ( [ scaling1 ] ) was studied for the scale - invariant @xmath16 case in @xcite , both numerically and analytically , and extended to arbitrary spacetime dimension in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the  modified lifshitz solution . \"",
    "the five - dimensional @xmath17 solution was presented in @xcite , where the authors studied a charged dilaton ads@xmath18 black hole with a ten - dimensional uplift to spinning d3 branes .",
    "that full dilatonic black hole solution approaches this one , for certain values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in the limit that the scalar field is large and one can neglect an exponential term in its potential .",
    "we noted earlier that the single - power scaling of the metric is characteristic of the leading small @xmath21 behavior of some solution near an extremal horizon of vanishing area . restricting our attention to only that term , and demanding that it be part of an exact solution to the action ( [ actionintro ] )",
    ", we found that the potential must be a single exponential in @xmath13 , namely the term in some full potential which dominates near the horizon , of course ; this was indeed the motivation of @xcite to consider the scaling solution at all .",
    "it was also suggested in @xcite that a deformation of the potential @xmath22 which generates an ads critical point would allow one to study the einstein frame solution ( [ scaling1 ] ) holographically via ads / cft .",
    "that would necessarily turn the solution into an ir phase of a conformal , not merely quantum , field theory .",
    "we take a different approach , asking as we did earlier about ir behavior of theories with relativistic symmetry instead .    even in the conformal case",
    ", one should be able to use dw / qft at intermediate energies below the scale at which conformal symmetry is manifest , where a single term of a full ( even stringy ) potential dominates .",
    "we argue for this role of dw / qft in the body of the paper , guided by the philosophy of effective field theory .",
    "consider , for instance , a scalar potential of the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this admits an ads vacuum at the origin , stable with respect to the breitenlohner - freedman bound .",
    "when @xmath13 is large , the potential is dominated by the second term .",
    "so for a solution in which @xmath13 goes to @xmath25 at the horizon , then decreases monotonically outwards and settles at its @xmath26 ads critical point , the fields behave as though near a domain wall boundary over a large range of @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that domain wall holography can act as an effective holographic tool at intermediate energies where a theory is only relativistic , and the terms in the full potential that become large at larger radii ( higher energies ) are not needed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first show , in section 2 , that such scaling behavior for the metric is only compatible with single exponential scalar potentials and gauge coupling functions . in the process , we come to bear on why there is attractor behavior in the extremal modified lifshitz case , despite the presence of a scalar field that breaks the isometry : the functional form of the scalar",
    "is fixed once the metric is given .",
    "we construct the scaling solution in terms of a fixed lagrangian and explore its parameter space .",
    "section 3 reviews the relevant aspects of domain wall geometries and introduces the dw / qft correspondence itself .",
    "we argue that only a subclass of all domain walls can be treated holographically , namely those with a boundary .",
    "the meat of the paper begins in section 4 , where we describe and show evidence of the numerical construction of the global solution , which is of scaling form in the ir and domain wall form in the uv .",
    "we put this to use in section 5 , where we expose a generalized scale invariance of the scaling solution that descends from the generalized conformal structure of the domain wall . in section 6 , we argue for the wider applicability of domain wall holography , and classify when it is safe to use , by drawing on effective field theory principles and lessons from the case of nonconformal d - branes .",
    "section 7 concludes with a discussion of the results and prospects for future work .",
    "_ note : _ as this work was being finalized , two papers appeared which give different treatments of the same solutions .",
    "the authors of @xcite characterize a wide class of theories that includes ours and provide a thorough analytic investigation .",
    "they make the assumption that the theories have ads critical points in the uv , which we do not , as discussed earlier .",
    "additionally , we provide the numerical construction of the global solution which explicitly permits holographic analysis .",
    "the paper @xcite complements our work by calculating conductivities of the scaling solution .",
    "we reproduce the action of our d - dimensional einstein - maxwell - scalar bulk system as @xmath27 with no reference to any string or m - theory origin as yet . , avoiding the peculiarities of lower - dimensional gravity . ]",
    "@xmath28 is a positive definite function , to ensure the correct sign for the gauge kinetic term",
    ". we will consider solutions with electric charge only , so we do not write any chern - simons terms ; we also do not show the boundary terms required for the usual construction of a well - defined variational problem .    our electric , non - relativistic , planar - symmetric ansatz is @xmath29 where @xmath30 indexes the @xmath31 boundary spatial coordinates .",
    "this metric describes planar black holes , putatively dual to an electrically charged boundary theory living in minkowski space .",
    "our first goal is to show that the scaling behavior for the metric discussed earlier is only compatible with an exponential gauge coupling function and scalar potential , and a logarithmically rolling scalar field . in the case of a constant potential ,",
    "we recover ads@xmath32 , ads@xmath33 , and the modified lifshitz geometry as limiting cases of the most general solution .    extracting the field equations , the @xmath34 component of maxwell s equations",
    "can be integrated to give the field strength , @xmath35 the integration constant @xmath36 acts as the charge density of the black hole .",
    "writing the rest of the field equations in these terms , we have the scalar equation , @xmath37 as well as three einstein equations , @xmath38 the bracketed einstein equation , @xmath39 , is implied by the rest of the field equations , shown for example by differentiation of the constraint equation @xmath40 and substitution from the others .",
    "as we plug in the scaling behavior @xmath41 we note that will only consider solutions with @xmath42 , so that our solutions obey the usual definition of extremality , namely @xmath43 , ensuring smooth connection to the finite temperature solutions .",
    "we also point out that the field equations dictate that @xmath44  where scale invariance of the metric obtains when @xmath16  and @xmath45 . upon fixing the form of the lagrangian consistent with admission of the scaling solution ,",
    "these bounds become clear ; so let us proceed .",
    "returning to the field equations , then , the first einstein equation ( e1 ) tells us that the scalar field must take the form @xmath46 the remaining undetermined functions are those of the scalar field , @xmath28 and @xmath22 .",
    "but for a neutral scalar , we can form a linear combination of the einstein equations in which the scalar only appears in @xmath28 : taking @xmath47 , we have    @xmath48    the gauge coupling function @xmath28 is fully determined by the metric and therefore , by the first - order equation @xmath40 , so is @xmath22 . specifically , they are both constrained to be exponential in @xmath13 , that is , power law in @xmath21 : plugging in the scaling form of the metric reveals , up to positive constants , @xmath49    where we have defined @xmath50 demanding reality of the flux , @xmath51 , implies @xmath52 : allowed combinations of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "are bounded by the lines @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for @xmath42",
    ", the metric must have @xmath57 where saturation occurs for vanishing flux , e.g. in ads@xmath32 where @xmath58 .",
    "this is the cousin of the fact that , for example , the lifshitz geometry ( [ lifshitz ] ) sourced by real two- and three - form fluxes , as in @xcite , can only act as a gravity dual to lifshitz fixed points with @xmath59 .",
    "such a similarity in the causal structure of our scaling solution to the lifshitz solution is our first hint that the two may have some connection .",
    "furthermore , by plugging this form for @xmath28 back into the einstein equations , one sees that the potential is also a power law in @xmath21 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 + @xmath62 implies @xmath63 for @xmath64 ; thus , @xmath22 must be negative . and because @xmath44 , @xmath22 must diverge at small @xmath21 or be constant everywhere .",
    "as expected , a scale - invariant solution can only solve a theory with the latter : as we rescale @xmath21 , @xmath13 picks up a constant , which must not affect the energy of the theory because we are simply executing a symmetry transformation .",
    "what we have shown , in the end , is that the scalar rolls down the exponential potential as it nears the horizon , presumably signaling the dive toward zero entropy at zero temperature : @xmath13 is  looking \" for a critical point of the potential , as exists for the unique finite entropy extremal ads@xmath33 geometry @xcite , but can not find it .",
    "even in the case where the potential @xmath22 is constant , the exponentiality of the gauge coupling function @xmath28 explains the zero extremal entropy in terms of the attractor mechanism @xcite : the diverging scalar drives the system toward the runaway minimum of the effective attractor potential , @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that there is attractor behavior at all despite the lack of true so(2,1 ) isometry is accounted for by our analysis above : the form of the attractor potential is fixed once the metric s so(2,1 ) isometry is given .",
    "thus we have a case of an attractor in which the full functional form of the massless scalar is fixed near the extremal horizon .",
    "let us note that if the scalar is charged , the form of @xmath28 and @xmath22 is not fixed as above , indicating that a charged interaction between @xmath13 and @xmath66 is compatible with extremal scaling behavior ( [ scaling1 ] ) for a range of gauge couplings and potentials .",
    "in anticipation of a possible embedding of this solution into a consistent truncation of some higher - dimensional supergravity , we end this subsection with the observation that a multi - scalar version of this solution can also support the metric ( [ scaling2 ] ) . writing a schematic action",
    "@xmath67 field equation ( e1 ) is satisfied for all scalars logarithmic in @xmath21 .",
    "then the power law behavior of @xmath68 and @xmath69 means that both are products of exponentials , @xmath70 the space of solutions is then dictated by which of the @xmath71 is nonzero .",
    "having shown that such exact scaling solutions only exist in theories with an exponential scalar potential and gauge coupling function , we rewrite the action and establish parametric definitions in terms of lagrangian parameters .",
    "our action is @xmath72 withou the flux term , this theory describes a consistent sphere truncation of a higher - dimensional supergravity to gravity coupled to a single scalar @xcite .",
    "our ansatz , once more , is @xmath73 as @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be eliminated by rescaling @xmath21 and @xmath76 , respectively , we will set @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    ". then the parameters of our ansatz , @xmath79 are given in terms of the physical parameters of the theory , @xmath80 as follows : @xmath81 as we have no scale invariance , @xmath82 receives a constant rescaling as we rescale @xmath21 . for order one radii",
    ", the validity of our classical analysis demands that @xmath82 is small .",
    "this is essentially the phenomenological version of taking the large n limit : for an action without fluxes descendant from string theory , there is no clear concept of what n is , and instead we just insist that the gravity theory is classical . on the field theory side , this guarantees that the density of degrees of freedom is large .",
    "without loss of generality we restrict @xmath83 , and",
    "equation ( [ pot ] ) then implies that @xmath24 and @xmath13 must diverge to positive infinity at the horizon .",
    "we elucidate the content of these expressions by noting the following :    * when @xmath84 , @xmath16 : the scalar potential is constant , and our solutions become scale invariant .",
    "this framework enables us to consider ads@xmath32 ( @xmath85 , no flux , @xmath13 constant ) , ads@xmath33 ( @xmath86 , flux through @xmath87 , @xmath13 constant ) , and the modified lifshitz solution ( @xmath20 arbitrary , @xmath88 , flux through @xmath87 , @xmath89 ) as formal limits . * in order for @xmath90 for small @xmath21 and the flux to be real , the bound on @xmath20 in terms of some fixed @xmath19 is @xmath91 the lower bound says that @xmath44 , where saturation occurs only if the potential is constant ( @xmath84 ) .    to be certain that this scaling solution is within the domain of validity of a classical gravitational treatment , we study the singularity structure of the spacetime . calculation of the ricci scalar , squared ricci tensor and kretschmann invariant reveal a curvature singularity at @xmath92 for the general scaling solution : @xmath93 where @xmath94 that can never simultaneously vanish .",
    "this reproduces the result that the extremal lifshitz metric ( @xmath16 ) has constant , finite curvature everywhere , but also tells us that spacetimes with @xmath95 are smooth at large @xmath21 , and in fact have asymptotically vanishing curvature invariants .",
    "we will return to this important fact in the next section , where we begin to discuss domain walls as holographic spacetimes .",
    "as for the singularity at @xmath92 , we will show the near - extremal generalization of this solution presently , shielding the singularity in the usual manner .",
    "this theory also admits a finite temperature generalization of our scaling solution , whereby one adds an emblackening factor to the metric that protects the singularity at the origin : now , @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and all other fields and parametric definitions remain unchanged .",
    "preservation of the correct metric signature is ensured for @xmath98 .",
    "one finds the temperature of the geometry via the usual analytic continuation to euclidean space , where demanding periodicity of the time coordinate so as to avoid conical singularity at the origin gives @xmath99    the entropy per unit volume of the planar horizon is @xmath100 yielding an entropy density - temperature scaling relation , @xmath101 other thermodynamic quantities follow from differentiation of the entropy density , e.g. the specific heat is positive and of the same power in @xmath102 as the entropy density .    by definition",
    ", @xmath103 implies @xmath42 and vice versa , ensuring that the @xmath104 extremal limit is obtained smoothly as we lower the temperature .",
    "one can arrange for an infinite range of @xmath105 by changing the physical parameters of the theory .",
    "let us quickly note two facts about this scaling :    1 .",
    "@xmath106 , its free field value , when @xmath107 , a @xmath108-independent result .",
    "2 .   for a given @xmath19 ,",
    "there is a one - parameter family of theories which have linear specific heat , @xmath109 , for which @xmath110 this @xmath20 is consistent with the bound ( [ alphabound ] ) .",
    "generically , this value of @xmath20 appears to have no relation to any ads@xmath111 geometry of the gravity dual .",
    "how do we use gauge / gravity duality in this situation ? in the usual ads / cft correspondence , the behavior of the bulk fields maps onto properties of the dual field theory living on the boundary .",
    "the area of the black hole horizon would correspond to the low temperature entropy of the theory whose ir physics is captured by the bulk dynamics at small @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath16 , ads is the natural vacuum of the theory , and so such an interpretation is possible , presuming an interpolating solution exists that patches the ir geometry onto an asymptotic ads in the uv .",
    "this was found numerically in @xcite for the extremal modified lifshitz solution .",
    "but in the context of a theory which does not admit an ads vacuum , this framework obviously can not apply . a global solution ,",
    "if it exists , patches the ir dynamics onto some other uv spacetime : one must ask what this spacetime is , and whether a correspondence can be set up which permits us to make such thermodynamic identifications of geometric quantities .",
    "this latter question is answered affirmatively as we turn to the solution which is the analog of ads in this theory , namely the domain wall spacetime .",
    "consider the parametric relations ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "suppose our theory was such that @xmath112 , and hence the scaling solution would have zero flux : then the metric would have @xmath113 . when @xmath114 , this is of course ads .",
    "when @xmath115 , this is none other than a domain wall solution , familiar from various contexts and the obvious backbone of the dw / qft correspondence .",
    "for instance , the noncompact part of the extremal near - horizon d - brane geometry has this form , as do extremal solitonic solutions in dimensionally reduced gauged supergravities .",
    "we show below that , in fact , such a domain wall solution exists for all allowed sets of @xmath116 .    ignoring supersymmetries",
    ", this spacetime can have , at most , poincar symmetry . whereas asymptotically ads solutions are gravity duals to conformal field theories , asymptotically domain wall solutions are gravity duals to theories with only a relativistic symmetry .",
    "the decrease in elegance in establishing a correspondence in this case is countered by the increase in the number of real - world systems to which this treatment is applicable .",
    "we first review the details of domain walls with an eye toward establishing the holographic correspondence . in the process",
    ", we show why domain walls with @xmath117 are unfit for this purpose .",
    "the most general single - scalar domain wall solution can be written in the form @xmath118 in our model , the parametric definitions are @xmath119    the forms of @xmath5 and @xmath120 can be obtained from the scaling solution parameters @xmath54 and @xmath121 , respectively , by substituting @xmath112 ( i.e. the @xmath122 condition ) into the expressions ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the form of @xmath123 has a similar relation to its counterpart , @xmath82 , which is only manifest in a gauge in which the constant part of the scalar is chosen to vanish : defining a new radial coordinate @xmath124 and shifting the boundary coordinates as @xmath125 we have the solution @xmath126 indeed , @xmath127 .",
    "let us stress that the aforementioned substitution for @xmath20 is only a parametric manipulation designed to derive the form of the vacuum solution ; the solution exists for _ any _ values of @xmath128 consistent with other physical principles mentioned elsewhere .",
    "one can perform a perturbative analysis in the parameter @xmath19 by considering @xmath129 , which means a potential that is effectively constant over a large range of @xmath13 . because @xmath19 enters quadratically in the exponent @xmath5 but linearly in @xmath120 , the solution ( [ dw ] ) , to first order in @xmath19 , looks like ads with a slowly rolling scalar field .",
    "the scalar klein - gordon equation expanded about the ads background to first order in @xmath19 , @xmath130 reveals logarithmic behavior for @xmath13 near the boundary , to leading order in @xmath21 .",
    "while this domain wall solution makes clear its relation to our scaling solutions and to dp - brane geometries , we wish to briefly make contact with other literature on solitonic supergravity domain walls by rewriting this metric in new , conformally flat coordinates : a harmonic function on the ( one - dimensional ) transverse space multiplying a minkowski line element plus a  radial \" term , describing a solitonic @xmath31 brane in a d - dimensional space .",
    "labeling the new transverse coordinate @xmath131 , we can write the metric as @xmath132 which defines the harmonic function and radial coordinate as @xmath133 assuming that @xmath134 , integrating gives @xmath135 where we define @xmath136 and have chosen the integration constant such that the constant in @xmath137 is equal to one . the full solution , with the scalar field , is thus @xmath138 the likeness of this solution to the noncompact part of dp - brane metrics along with the running scalar is no coincidence , because various dimensional reductions of 10- and 11-dimensional maximal supergravities give rise to a panoply of such solitons in the corresponding lower - dimensional supergravities @xcite .",
    "the interpolating structure is evident : the metric asymptotes to flat space as @xmath139 , and to near - horizon form with the asymptotically flat part decoupled as @xmath140 .",
    "note the @xmath141 sign in @xmath137 , which enables one to construct domain walls with @xmath142 symmetry .    further defining the constant @xmath143 enables us to write the full solution as @xmath144 this matches the solution in @xcite , for example .    when @xmath145 , we instead have the relation @xmath146 again with an integration constant chosen for simplification .",
    "now , @xmath147 and the full solution reads @xmath148    returning to the form ( [ dw ] ) , one sees that , at least for @xmath149 , the domain wall spacetime is well - suited for holographic correspondence . in accord with the discussion in section 2 , it is well - behaved at large @xmath21 , and more importantly , it has a boundary in the ads sense .",
    "specifically , the coordinate time to @xmath150 along a null ( timelike ) geodesic is finite ( infinite ) , despite an infinite proper radial distance to the boundary from any point in the interior : @xmath151    crucially , the domain wall spacetime is conformal to ads : @xmath152 one should think of this metric as ads in  interpolating coordinates \" , where the value of @xmath5 determines whether the boundary lies at @xmath153 or @xmath92 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath154 gives ads in conformally flat coordinates with a boundary at @xmath92 , @xmath155 gives ads in coordinates with the boundary at @xmath156 , and other values on either side of @xmath157 simply stretch one of these limiting spacetimes .",
    "is once again special , as the metric is not ads ; we recognize this from the cases of the near - horizon metrics of ns5 and d5-branes of type ii supergravity , a connection we discuss more later . ]",
    "these interpolating coordinates provide a convenient heuristic to understand why domain walls with @xmath117 do not have a boundary .",
    "consider the construction of such domain walls by multiplying the ads metric ( [ ads ] ) by the conformal factor , @xmath158 .",
    "this vanishes at @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , if we start from an ads metric with the boundary at @xmath92 , the map to the domain wall spacetime will not be faithful because the infinite volume near the boundary is cancelled by the degenerating conformal factor .",
    "in addition to not having a boundary , the extremal @xmath117 domain walls have ill - defined thermodynamic properties .",

    "all other fields are turned off .    whether the interpolation could actually be constructed in this imaginary theory",
    "is a matter of numerics , not argument : one can not assume the existence of an interpolating solution in a given theory without actually constructing it .",
    "but it seems reasonable that given a stringy effective action , a more complicated extremal solution to that theory which approaches our scaling solution in the near - horizon limit would interpolate to the approximate domain wall solution of that theory at intermediate energies .",
    "this should also be true for an ad hoc action with a scalar potential as in ( [ dwads ] ) .",
    "in fact , this sort of analysis leads one to consider dw / qft as an effective holographic tool , applicable in settings far more general than domain wall supergravities , where we use  effective \" in the field theory sense .",
    "our assertion is that even when the uv completion of some bulk theory is unknown , if that theory admits an approximate domain wall solution at some intermediate value of @xmath21 then one can use dw / qft to develop a holographic map .",
    "let us explore this idea .",
    "the central tenet of effective field theory , informed by the philosophy of the renormalization group , is that physics at low energies should not be sensitive to physics at high energies .",
    "naively , ads / cft seems to violate this idea : given an effective field theory , one needs to know something about its uv physics , namely whether the theory is conformal , in order to know whether it has a well - defined ir gravity dual .",
    "of course this is an incorrect mode of thought , because gauge / gravity duality , it can be said , is not a right , but a privilege of conformal field theories ( and their deformations and subsequent holographic extensions ) .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason why every field theory should have a gravity dual . from what we know",
    "so far , one could argue that classifying the types of field theories which _ might _ have gravity duals boils down to finding bulk spacetimes with boundaries , in which case the attendant isometries dictate the field theory symmetries .",
    "actually , we can consider an elementary case in which the bulk has no ads solution in the uv and we know how to treat it holographically : the case of a positive mass scalar field . as a bulk field dual to an irrelevant cft operator ,",

    "at which its backreaction ruins the ads asymptotics , we work with a radial cutoff , dual to working with an effective field theory below the corresponding energy scale . to incorporate",
    "the backreaction of the scalar would be to find the full uv completion of the theory ; in its absence , one works with the effective ads boundary and proceeds essentially as usual .",
    "analogously , one is entitled to use dw / qft in settings beyond those in which the domain wall geometry is a true vacuum of the theory  one can work with a cutoff boundary at finite @xmath21 , at which the bulk fields will have falloffs characteristic of a domain wall boundary .",
    "this is exactly what one does in the case of nonconformal d - branes , fundamental strings , and ns5 branes : the supergravity approximation can not be trusted for large ( or small ) @xmath21 , i.e. high ( or low ) energies .",
    "of course , for some of these branes , the uv completion is given in terms of m - theory solutions in one greater spacetime dimension , which is interesting in and of itself : even in cases like the d4-brane where we know that the solution uplifts to an ads@xmath285 vacuum in the uv , we can still define an effective ten - dimensional nonconformal holography .",
    "this m - theory resolution of strong effective ten - dimensional string coupling is obviously a deep and special case , but it alludes to the general possibility that even when a potential ( borne from string / m - theory compactification or otherwise ) has no ads vacuum , dw / qft can be used at intermediate energies .    to rephrase , accepting the validity of nonconformal holography demands that it should have the same role as ads holography in situations where the bulk must have a uv radial cutoff . in the absence of a continuum limit , even in ads / cft",
    ", one can not be sure that holography is describing a theory that is not sick ; this is no different in the nonconformal case and permits us to extend its regime likewise .",
    "we can summarize when it is safe to use domain wall holography in theories that admit ( at least approximate ) domain wall vacua .    1 .",
    "when a phenomenological theory admits an exact domain wall solution , like our theory ( [ action ] ) , domain wall holography is on firm footing . without a string / m - theory embedding , the theory is not quantumly well - defined ; when an exact domain wall solution _ does _ arise in a consistent truncation of string / m - theory , domain wall holography is valid even on the level of quantum corrections .",
    "+ in fact , our action ( [ action ] ) can indeed be obtained in such a manner , where @xmath20 and @xmath19 are fixed by the compactification .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that starting with the canonical @xmath286 and @xmath287 sphere compactifications of string and m - theory , one can deform these spheres by taking certain moduli to a limit in which the compactification on @xmath288 becomes one on @xmath289 , where @xmath290 .",
    "the resulting d - dimensional effective lagrangian , suitably ( and consistently ) truncated to a single scalar , reads @xmath291 that is , @xmath292 .",

    "suppose our potential is still given as @xmath299 we know that the domain wall metric will be conformal to ads via the conformal factor @xmath300 , so the einstein frame metric @xmath301 will have conformal frame scale invariance .",
    "what type of matter lagrangian can support this metric ?",
    "it would also be worthwhile to find a string / m - theory embedding of our scaling solution , or a generalization of it .",
    "the string theory - derived effective action ( [ stringy ] ) which we presented earlier could not accomodate it , but there are large families of similar actions of domain wall gravities , as laid out in @xcite .",
    "the domain wall would generally be supported by some number of scalars , which would be no impediment to use of dw / qft .",
    "lastly , it would clearly be nice to delve deeper into the thermodynamics of this system , though that has largely been done in the recent papers cited earlier @xcite . perhaps adding fermionic degrees of freedom to the theory",
    "would be worthwhile as well .    *",

    "this work was supported in part by a leo p.",
    "delsasso fellowship from the ucla department of physics and astronomy .",
    "we clarify a lingering issue in the extraction of field theory thermodynamics from interpolating gravity solutions , as we present the numerical construction of the interpolating solution for a finite temperature black hole with ir lifshitz scaling .",
    "the motivation for doing so is that without patching the ir spacetime onto its uv ads vacuum , the entropy density for the dual field theory can only be known up to an overall coefficient .",
    "the ir black hole provides the scaling behavior of the entropy , but because the spacetime is warped as the ir solution is patched onto an asymptotic ads in the uv , the normalization of the horizon area generally receives a rescaling upon insisting that the ads metric take its canonical , poincar - invariant form . in other words ,",
    "if one defines the normalization of the boundary coordinates by using the ads asymptotics , one must rescale the coordinates globally , and hence the area of the horizon will be rescaled by some constant .        for an extremal black hole with lifshitz scaling , @xmath303 the ir behavior of the metric",
    "is determined by this scale invariance up to a constant : @xmath304 where @xmath305 is a constant .",
    "the solution is not poincar invariant .",
    "as noted earlier , this interpolating solution was numerically constructed in @xcite for the @xmath306 extremal solution , where the authors solved the linearized perturbation equations .",
    "the metric goes as @xmath307 and @xmath308 where @xmath309 and @xmath195 are the characteristic length scales of the lifshitz and ads geometries , respectively .",
    "@xmath305 is not fixed by any symmetry .    in thinking about the finite temperature solutions",
    ", one can view them as being  glued in \" to the zero temperature background , which is to say that the near - extremal black holes have extremal asymptotics : @xmath310 where @xmath311 and @xmath312 . in the context of an interpolating solution ,",
    "this is only strictly true in the infinitesimal temperature limit : as one raises the temperature , the horizon extends outward toward the ir extremal asymptotic region so that in the full global solution , the uv asymptotics will change .",
    "the d - dimensional lifshitz black holes we are considering in this paper are supported by a scalar field and a u(1 ) gauge field ; their entropy densities , as determined by scaling symmetry , will have the form @xmath313 where hats denote dimensionless quantities , made with appropriate powers of , in our case , the charge density .",
    "what we wish to show numerically , as a consequence of the above , is that as one lowers the dimensionless temperature @xmath314 of the black hole while keeping the dimensionless source @xmath315 fixed , the combination @xmath316 asymptotes to a fixed value , determined by the value of @xmath315 and @xmath305 : @xmath317    we form dimensionless parameters with the asymptotic charge density @xmath36 , defined by the usual ads asymptotics as @xmath318 then for a massless scalar in bulk spacetime dimension @xmath108 , and hence with asymptotic falloff @xmath319 we have @xmath320      we choose to fix the source at @xmath324 , integrating out to large @xmath21 such that @xmath325 , where @xmath326 .",
    "the plot below shows that , indeed , the behavior ( [ app ] ) is satisfied down to temperature @xmath327 ; further probes of lower temperatures allowed by numerical stability do not deviate from this behavior .",
