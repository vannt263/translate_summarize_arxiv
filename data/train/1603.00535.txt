    ", we will show another example for this kind of discussion : a high - quality fabry - prot cavity embedding matters with a damping of excitations .",
    "such a system has long been discussed in the study of quantum optics or so - called cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) @xcite , and master equations of the lindblad form have been used in most cases .",
    "however , we will show that , from the hamiltonian of the sec derived for the fabry - prot cavity @xcite , master equations of a non - lindblad form are obtained in general . for transforming it to the lindblad form , we need to apply the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) to the sec hamiltonian , which has been widely used in the study of quantum optics ( but implicitly in most cases ) .",
    "the influence of the rwa to the sec was discussed also in the study of the quantum brownian motion @xcite , while it was not used in the early study of the quantum description of dissipation @xcite .",
    "we will calculate absorption spectra of the cavity system by the lindblad and non - lindblad master equations , and they will be compared with the results calculated by the maxwell boundary conditions ( mbcs ) at a mirror of the cavity in the framework of the classical electrodynamics , which is considered as the most reliable method ( direct consequence by the physical law ) in this paper . although the quantum theory should reproduce the results in the classical theory , we sometimes face an inconsistency caused by approximations used in the quantum theory ( rwa to sec in our case ) . we will find that the non - lindblad master equation gives more consistent results with those by the mbcs . the discrepancy between the results by the lindblad master equation and by the other two",
    "is highlighted in the ultra - strong light - matter interaction regime @xcite with a relatively rapid damping of excitations in matters .",
