    "modern experimental techniques made it possible to grow epitaxial films with atomic precision creating a whole new class of complex materials with unique properties where interfaces often play the decisive role @xcite .",
    "ultrathin films of insulating materials grown on a metal support are one example of such materials @xcite . in particular , due to the proximity of the insulator / metal interface to the vacuum / insulator interface the adsorption properties of such complex substrates can be completely different from those of the surfaces of the corresponding insulating materials @xcite .",
    "this makes complex substrates very interesting for applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis @xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "one of the intriguing properties of metal supported thin films is a charging of neutral atoms adsorbed on them .",
    "this phenomenon was first found when the charge of an au atom adsorbed on nacl supported by cu was manipulated with scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "the gold atom was reversibly switched between the two states : stable and charged .",
    "this experimental finding was also supported by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite .",
    "a spontaneous adatom charging was for the first time predicted in dft calculations for an au atom deposited onto mgo / mo  @xcite .",
    "the gold atom on this substrate appeared to be negatively charged and its adsorption energy turned out to be significantly increased as compared to the adsorption of au on mgo @xcite .",
    "these theoretical findings were later supported by experimental results @xcite .",
    "more recently the charging effect was intensively studied theoretically and experimentally for different combinations of metal support and thin film materials , and adsorbates ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "summarizing the current knowledge about metal supported thin films and their adsorption properties we notice the following facts .",
    "thin films can substantially reduce the work function of support metals @xcite , which should lead to easier charge transfer . however , the charging of adatoms can also happen despite the increase of work function @xcite . for charging adatom should have high enough electron affinity @xcite .",
    "the origin of adatom charge was found to be the metal and oxide interface as shown for au / mgo / ag @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the electron abstraction from the interface modifies the oxide / metal interaction and increases the adhesion between film and metal @xcite .",
    "it was also established that the charging of adatom is a long - range phenomenon and could occur for relatively thick films @xcite .",
    "honkala et al",
    ". showed that the charge of au on mgo / mo was almost independent of the thickness of mgo ranging from 1 to 5 monolayers .",
    "although the formation of negatively charged species on metal supported ultrathin films is quite a widespread phenomenon , the mechanism behind the charging is still under debate .",
    "first , it was suggested to be a direct electron tunneling from the support metal conduction band states to the adatom empty states  @xcite .",
    "however , many authors avoid this concept ( see , e.g. refs .  ) , emphasizing instead the role of electrostatic interaction and system polarization  @xcite .",
    "we also notice that charge redistribution at metal / insulator interfaces was intensively studied in semiconductor physics  @xcite and a number of useful concepts , such as band bending and space charge layer formation were developed  @xcite .",
    "it is known that charging is accompanied by surface distortions around the adsorbed adatom @xcite .",
    "moreover , calculations show that there is no charging on frozen   surfaces @xcite .",
    "the importance of rumpling and surface distortion was most consistently studied by goniakowski et al .",
    "( refs .  ) , who showed that the charge transfer from the metal into the thin film or adatom is quasilinearly proportional to the rumpling of the interface .",
    "moreover , these works reported an important finding that the relationship between the charge transfer and film deformation were similar for both bare supported films and the films with adatoms  @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that interface rumpling is a response of the system to the spontaneous charge redistribution at the interface  @xcite .    here",
    "we report the results of a systematic study of the scn / mo , mgo / mo and naf / mo systems with a cu adatom .",
    "mgo , scn and naf were chosen for their simple rock - salt structure and small lattice mismatch with mo .",
    "the anions of these compounds are neighbours in the periodic table of elements that can yield a trend in properties",
    ". moreover , naf and mgo are ionic compounds , while scn is more covalent and is a semiconductor , which allows us to do a comparative study .",

    "we investigate the origin of the adatom charge and where it accumulates .",

    "the calculations were carried out for the @xmath1 symmetric slabs , having two ab monolayers ( ml ) on both sides of a 9 ml thick molybdenum slab ( fig .",

    "the thickness of the mo slab was chosen based on the convergence of the following characteristics _ i _ ) distances between adjacent ( 001 ) mo planes , _ ii _ ) density of states ( dos ) of surface mo layer , _ iii _ ) surface energy .",
    "also , the middle layer of the slab should possess bulk - like properties .",

    "since the films are ultrathin , while the metal support is supposed to be bulk - like @xcite we matched the lattice parameters of the films to the one of mo and aligned them with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 factor appears due to the mo(001 ) surface rotation by @xmath0 ) .",

    "moreover , it has recently been shown that both standard gga and hybrid functional produce very similar bader charges of an au adatom on mgo and cao substrates doped with mo or cr @xcite .    to understand the mechanism of adatom charging on the ab / mo surfaces we analysed the atomic charges calculated using the bader approach @xcite .",

    "the interface distance , on the contrary , increases from scn to naf ( table  [ tab : abmo ] ) , indicating a somewhat stronger bonding between scn and mo compared to the other considered cases .",
    "the charge density difference maps ( fig .",

    "for all the considered adsorption positions , the cu @xmath38 states fall below the fermi level and no spin - polarization is observed ( see the example of f on - top site , fig .  [",
    "fig : cu_dos]c ) .",
    "the bader charge of cu is almost the same for all the positions , @xmath39 , which is in agreement with charges reported for similar systems , e.g. au on mgo / mo @xcite . interestingly , despite fluorine being the most electronegative element of the periodic table cu charging occurs even for cu adsorbed on - top of f , which was found to be the most favorable adsorption site .",
    "charging of cu on naf / mo is accompanied by substantial atomic displacements in the top naf layer that results in rather large adsorption energies ( from 1.651 to 1.877  ev ) .",
    "in particular , the f atom , situated below adsorbed cu , moves downwards by 0.27   , while the four nearest na atoms move upwards by 0.57   .",
    "a similar distortion pattern was reported for au / mgo / mo @xcite .",
    "together with distortions around cu we also observe a prominent average rumpling ( @xmath40 ) of the naf surface layer ( @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] ) for all the adsorption sites ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) .",
    "the significant changes occur also at the interface , where the inversion of rumpling is observed and @xmath42 becomes smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "thus upon cu adsorption on - top of f the mo - f distance on average shortens by @xmath44 , as compared to that in naf / mo .",
    "for all the adsorption sites on naf / mo the same inversion of rumpling occurs ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) .",
    "similar structural changes were also reported for the adsorption on @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of cu adsorption on mgo / mo are similar to those of cu / naf / mo .",
    "cu charging occurs for all the four adsorption sites .",
    "the bader charges of cu , @xmath45 , are smaller than those for cu on naf / mo , but still significant ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "the adsorption energies are rather large ( from 1.326 ev to 1.466 ev ) , the favored adsorption site is the hollow site .",
    "the cu adsorption on mgo / mo is accompanied by notable surface relaxation .",
    "the two mg atoms , nearest to cu adsorbed at the hollow site , shift upwards by 0.19   , while two nearest o atoms move downwards by 0.11   .",
    "the average rumpling of the surface monolayer ( @xmath41 ) is about @xmath48 . at the same time , rumpling of the interface mgo layer ( @xmath49 ) is negligible as compared to that in the cu / naf / mo system .",
    "the average vertical distances from o ( @xmath49 ) to the mo ( @xmath50 ) layer and from mg ( @xmath49 ) to the mo ( @xmath50 ) layer are the same , 2.15  . due to the cu adsorption",
    "the mo - o distance shortens by @xmath51 .    according to bader analysis",
    "the cu atom on mgo / mo has a smaller charge than that on naf / mo , however , in both cases the cu @xmath38 states are filled and no spin - polarization is observed ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cu_dos ] ) .",
    "although the bader analysis can not be expected to unambiguously assign charges to atoms in a solid somewhat smaller charge of cu on mgo / mo corresponds to a smaller adsorption energy and smaller displacements of surface atoms in comparison with those for naf / mo .",
    "on scn / mo , cu prefers to adsorb on top of n that yields no charging .",
    "the cu @xmath38 states are half occupied and mixed with the n states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cu_dos]a ) .",
    "adsorption at this site results in cu - n covalent bonding with the cu - n distance of 1.86   and the adsorption energy of 1.609 ev .",
    "surface relaxation in this case is very weak in comparison with all the cases where charging is observed .    as a matter of fact , charging of cu occurs also on scn / mo for two adsorption sites : sc on - top and hollow .",
    "however , even in these cases it is less pronounced than in the cu / mgo / mo and cu / naf / mo systems . for cu adsorbed at the sc on - top site",
    "the cu @xmath38 states are fully occupied ( not shown ) and at the hollow site cu @xmath38 states are preponderantly occupied ( not shown ) .",
    "the calculated bader charges are still notable , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the sc on - top and hollow sites , respectively .",
    "the interface and surface rumpling is also negative as in the case of cu / naf / mo but somewhat less pronounced ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) .",
    "we notice that as cu gets charged at all adsorption sites on both mgo / mo and naf / mo the resulting adsorption energies are quite similar that provides a flat energy profile for cu on these surfaces , especially on mgo / mo , and , therefore , simplifies surface diffusion .",
    "this is not the case for scn / mo where the adsorption energies are very different , e.g. 0.752  ev and 1.609  ev for the sc on - top and n on - top positions , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that without metal support adatom charging is negligible ( see , e.g. ref . ) .",
    "we have examined cu adsorption on top of anions in the cu / ab systems ( 2ml ab with the same lattice parameter as in the other calculations ) . for the n on - top site of cu / scn we got @xmath54 = 1.523 ev and @xmath55 . for the o on - top site of cu / mgo we got @xmath54 = 1.110 ev and @xmath56 . for",
    "the f on - top site of cu / naf we got @xmath54 = 0.380 ev and @xmath57 .",
    "thus , in all these cases charging is negligible .",
    "the comparison of cu on scn / mo , mgo / mo and naf / mo allows us to make some general conclusions regarding the capability of metal supported thin films to charge adatoms . as follows from our results this capability is enhanced from scn / mo to mgo / mo and further to naf / mo .",
    "scn is a covalent compound also forming covalent - like bonds with mo , while mgo and naf are ionic ( see section  [ subsec : ab - mo ] ) . therefore , to construct a system where a substantial charge transfer is possible one could use ionic films whose states are weakly mixed with those of the metal support .",
    "strong adatom - substrate bonds can also prohibit the charge transfer whereas a weaker interaction between the adatom and a film can promote it .",
    "notice that cu and mgo ( naf ) states almost do not mix .",
    "the same trend we find for cu adsorbed at the sc on - top and hollow sites on scn / mo where a charge transfer takes place .",
    "thus , a minimum mixing between adatom and thin film states as well as between those of the insulating film and the metal support appear to be crucial for charging to occur .",
    "we also investigated the adsorption of cu on frozen surfaces for the most stable positions : n on - top site for cu / scn / mo , hollow site for cu / mgo / mo , and f on - top site for cu / naf / mo ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) . for the f on - top ( cu / naf / mo ) and hollow sites ( cu / mgo / mo )",
    "the adsorption energies and bader charges of cu are reduced significantly . according to the density of states calculated for these cases",
    "the cu spin - down @xmath38 states are split from the spin - up states and are not fully occupied .",
    "these findings agree with the results reported for the au adsorption on frozen mgo / ag @xcite .",
    "we also notice that in the case of cu adsorption at the n on - top site of scn / mo the adsorption energy , bader charge and the cu - n distance calculated for the frozen and fully relaxed surfaces are very similar ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) .",
    "this is due to the absence of charging in both cases , when the cu - n bond is a dominating contribution to the adsorption energy .",
    "also we observe , that if there is no charging or it is significantly reduced ( as on frozen surfaces ) the vertical distance from the cu to the surface is shorter , while charged cu shifts further away from the surface ( see table  [ tab : cuabmo ] ) .",
    "thus our results confirm the importance of surface relaxation for adatom charging .",
    "we also find it useful to study the characteristics of the ab / mo systems having exactly the same surface distortion as the cu / ab / mo systems ( i.e. when all a , b and mo atoms are kept in the same positions as in cu / ab / mo , but cu is removed ) .",

    "@xmath59 could be used as a measure of surface distortion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_edist ] we show the charge of cu in cu / ab / mo versus distortion energy of [ cu]/ab / mo , @xmath59 .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the energy of distortion and charge transferred to cu , in fact , @xmath59 and charge are linearly proportional to each other .",
    "the charge accumulated by the cu adatom comes from ab / mo , but where is the origin of this charge ?",
    "the analysis of the bader charges of the substrate monolayers , calculated as described in section  [ subsec : comp ] , makes it possible to answer this question . here",
    "we study the charge distribution in cu / ab / mo , [ cu]/ab / mo and ab / mo . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_ml ] we show the layer charges for the three most stable configurations : n on - top site for cu / scn / mo , hollow site for cu / mgo / mo and f on - top site for cu / naf / mo .",
    "let us , first , compare cu / ab / mo and ab / mo .",
    "[ fig : q_ml ] ( top panels ) shows that for all cu / ab / mo the charge redistribution mostly occurs at the interface , while deeper mo layers remain practically unaffected . for cu adsorbed at the n on - top site , neither significant changes at the interface can be seen . for cu adsorbed at the hollow site on mgo / mo , where a significant charge transfer to cu takes place , the charge of the adatom originates from the metal / oxide interface , mostly from the first mo layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q_ml]b top panel ) . these findings for cu / mgo / mo and cu / naf / mo agree well with previous reports on au / mgo / mo and /mgo / mo @xcite .",
    "let us now consider distorted [ cu]/ab / mo , which has the geometry of relaxed cu / ab / mo but without cu . in terms of charge redistribution",
    "not much difference between cu / scn / mo and [ cu]/scn / mo is observed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : q_ml]a ) . for [ cu]/mgo / mo and [ cu]/naf / mo",
    ", however , one can see a strong polarization of ab and mo as a result of the distortion .",
    "similar to cu / mgo / mo and cu / naf / mo , the charge is accumulated in the top surface monolayer of mgo and naf ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : q_ml ] ) .",
    "the amount of charge accumulated in the surface layer is @xmath53 for mgo and @xmath60 for naf .",
    "the origin of the charge is again the mgo / mo ( naf / mo ) interface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : q_ml ] ) .",
    "the bader analysis of atomic charges shows that the excess charge , which for a particular atom we define as @xmath61/ab / mo } } - q_{\\text{ab / mo}}$ ] , is spread over several atoms in the top layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q_ml ] , bottom panels ) . in",
    "[ cu]/mgo / mo most of the excess charge is accumulated in the surface layer around the hollow site and in the next coordination sphere . in [ cu]/naf / mo @xmath62 excess charge",
    "is localized at the f atom ( below the cu in cu / naf / mo ) and @xmath63 is localized at the four surrounding na atoms .",
    "thus , for both [ cu]/mgo / mo and [ cu]/naf / mo the excess charge appears to be spread over the distorted top layer and its larger part is located at the adsorption site .",
    "the amount of this excess charge accumulated in the distorted ab top layer is almost equal to the charge of cu in the corresponding cu / ab / mo system .",

    "[ fig : spillover ] in appendix  a.      in this section we discuss the role of the thin film distortion in the charge transfer to the cu adatom using the case of cu adsorbed at the f on - top site on naf / mo ( cu / naf / mo ) , where charging is most pronounced .    to see how charge redistribution depends on the degree of deformation we approximated the deformation path of the surface with a linear geometry transformation .",
    "let us denote the set of coordinates of all the na and f atoms in naf / mo with @xmath64 and those in cu / naf / mo with @xmath65 , and introduce @xmath66 .",
    "next , let us consider the linear path of geometry transformation from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , which is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . for every value of @xmath69 the positions of na and f atoms",
    "are defined and frozen , while cu is allowed to relax .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the same linear transformation of naf / mo in the absence of cu ( the [ cu]/naf / mo case ) , as well as that of the naf film in the absence of both cu and mo ( the [ cu]/naf/[mo ] case ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_and_q_vs_xi ] .",
    "it is clear that in the case of cu adsorption on naf / mo ( cu / naf / mo ) the relaxation occurs spontaneously without any barrier .",
    "the charge of adatom increases almost linearly along the deformation path .",

    "[ fig : slab ] ) and mo ( @xmath41 ) interface layers monotonically decrease along the path ( shown for [ cu]/naf / mo , see fig .  [",
    "fig : e_and_q_vs_xi]b ) , thus charge is depleted from the naf / mo interface .    for",
    "cu / naf / mo the gradually applied distortion yields gradual charging of cu , while in the case of [ cu]/naf / mo it provides monotonic charge accumulation in the naf top layer ( @xmath41 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e_and_q_vs_xi]b ) .",
    "moreover , we notice that along the path the values of the charge of cu in cu / naf / mo and the charge of naf ( @xmath41 ) top layer in [ cu]/naf / mo are similar and become almost equal for @xmath70 .",

    "there are indications that metal supported ultrathin films have different phonon structure compared to thick films and should be more flexible @xcite . indeed , energy changes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_and_q_vs_xi]a demonstrate that it is much easier to deform [ cu]/naf / mo than [ cu]/naf/[mo ] . the same distortion from @xmath73 to @xmath70 costs 0.70 ev for [ cu]/naf / mo and 2.58 ev for [ cu]/naf/[mo ] .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the curves show rather harmonic behavior for [ cu]/naf/[mo ] , while for [ cu]/naf / mo and cu / naf / mo it is strongly anharmonic ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : e_and_q_vs_xi]a ) .",
    "notice that with ( or without ) cu adatom the energy change is almost linearly proportional to the accumulated charge .",
    "hence , we attribute the naf / mo anharmonicity to the coupling of deformation with the charge transfer from the mo / naf interface to the naf top layer ( in [ cu]/naf / mo ) or cu adatom ( in cu / naf / mo ) .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the ab / mo and cu / ab / mo systems ( ab = scn , mgo , naf ) .",
    "an enhancement of cu adatom charging from scn to mgo , and further to naf is observed .",
    "the results suggest that charging is more pronounced when mixing between the states of the insulating film and metal substrate as well as between those of an adatom and thin film is small .",
    "the film / metal interface is the origin of adatom charge .",
    "the charge transfer is accompanied with a strong surface relaxation around the adatom and structural changes at the film / metal interface .",
    "our results on cu / ab / mo show clear correlation between the amount of transferred charge and the degree of system distortion .",
    "moreover , the results of the constrained deformation calculations indicate that distortion is decisive for the charge transfer and it will pump  the charge into the top surface layer irrespective of an adatom presence or absence on the surface .",
    "we have found that the deformation of naf / mo film is essentially anharmonic , which we attribute to the coupling with the charge pumping  from metal / film interface to the film / vacuum interface or adatom .",
    "also , it is much easier to distort naf / mo than naf , therefore we expect that softening of some phonon modes of the metal supported films takes place .",
    "we would like to acknowledge swedish research council ( vr ) and swedish energy agency ( stem ) for the support .",
    "we also thank the swedish national infrastructure for computing ( snic ) for provided computational resources .",
    "p.a. . acknowledges a. v. ruban for interesting discussions .",
    "p.a. . also acknowledges vesta  @xcite software developers .",
    "the spatial distribution of charge accumulated in [ cu]/naf / mo was examined further . in fig .  [ fig : spillover ] we show charge density for [ cu]/naf / mo and [ cu]/naf/[mo ] integrated along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "let us recall , that [ cu]/naf / mo ( also [ cu]/naf/[mo ] ) have the same geometry as cu / naf / mo , but cu ( respectively cu and mo ) are absent .",
    "one can see that in the [ cu]/naf / mo case charge is more spread in the @xmath12 direction compared to the case when both cu adatom and mo support are removed ( [ cu]/naf/[mo ] ) . in particular , for [ cu]/naf / mo approximately @xmath74 are found above the position of cu in cu / ab / mo ( note , there is no cu in [ cu]/naf / mo ) .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the integrated magnetization curve , which agrees well with the integrated charge curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spillover ] ) .",
    "+    here we report the details behind the distortion of [ cu]/naf / mo from @xmath73 to @xmath70 ( see the main text for explanations ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_dos ] we show the evolution of the density of states near the fermi level for [ cu]/naf / mo , namely , for the f atom underneath cu in cu / naf / mo and the nearest na atoms in the top naf layer . according to the bader analysis these atoms accumulate the charge , while mo atoms in the interface layer lose it ( not shown ) that agrees well with the evolution of the density of states .",
    "the number of the f states below the fermi level ( mainly the @xmath75 states ) and na states ( mainly the @xmath71 states ) gradually increases along the deformation path ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi_dos ] ) , while the number of the mo states decreases ( not shown ) . as a result of the charge",
    "transfer the system becomes spin polarized , near the fermi level the spin - down states are unoccupied ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi_dos ] ) .",
    "therefore , our findings indicate that the f @xmath72 and na @xmath71 states participate in the charge transfer to cu adatom .",
