    "all the si - stm data were taken with the feed - back set point at a sample bias voltage of -150  mv and a tunneling current of 150  pa .",
    "magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the cleaved ( 001 ) surface .",

    "therefore , in order to argue the vortex - induced local changes in the electronic state , it is indispensable to compare two si - stm data sets , with and without a magnetic field , in exactly the same field of view .",
    "this is challenging because the actual si - stm images are inevitably distorted in an uncontrollable manner due to the creeping of the piezoelectric scanner , etc . in order to obtain distortion - free images from the observed ones , we utilize the so - called lawler - fujita algorithm  @xcite , which estimates the local distortion as a phase shift in the crystal - lattice modulations .",

    "most naively , the enhanced quasiparticle scattering off vortices may result in the enhanced @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "another possible origin is the spatial oscillations of the vortex bound state in the quantum - limit vortex core  @xcite , as proposed by yoshizawa and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "this model naturally explains the peaks in the spectrum at @xmath100  mev as the discrete bound states .",
    "nevertheless , more studies are necessary to verify the validity of the bound - state scenario , because it is not clear whether the vortex of a cuprate is in the quantum limit and the formation of the vortex bound state in a @xmath2-wave superconductor is still a controversial issue  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to examine the relationship between the locations of vortices and the various electronic heterogeneities , since this comparison may give us a hint to identify the elementary process of the vortex pinning .",
    "although previous si - stm studies have suggested that vortices in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 tend to be pinned at the regions where the @xmath65 is large  @xcite , these experiments were conducted only in a field and thereby could not exclude the possibility that the the pseudogap itself would be influenced by vortices .",
    "here we compare the locations of vortices with the zero - field electronic heterogeneity at @xmath65 .    using the same procedure described in supplementary section  1.3",
    ", we first identify the locations of vortices ( fig .",
    "s6 , a and b ) .",
    "we examine the azimuthally averaged cross - correlation function ( fig .",
    "s6c ) between the smoothed vortex map figs  s6b and three different spectroscopic images at @xmath65 : spatial variation of @xmath41 itself ( fig .",
    "s6d ) , @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "s6e ) , and the local amplitude of the broken - translational - symmetry state of the `` nanostripe '' , which is nothing but the local amplitude of the modulations at @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "s6f ) . here , we define the local amplitude of these modulations @xmath102 as follows ,    @xmath103    where @xmath104",
    ", @xmath105 is the cut - off length scale , and @xmath106 is the complex fourier transform of @xmath107 . as shown in fig .",
    "s6c , all of these quantities exhibit strong correlations with the locations of vortices .",
    "since vortices are generally pinned at weakly superconducting regions , these results suggest that at least one of these quantities would represent the fundamental measure of the weakness of superconductivity .",
    "although the microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning is unclear at present , the observed correlation between the vortex location and @xmath102 clearly indicates that the superconductivity is weak in the region where the `` nanostripe '' is prominent , indicating the competition between superconductivity and the `` nanostripe '' in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ."

    "<S> if the missing weight is caused by the reduction of electrons condensed in the pseudogap state , the enhanced `` nanostripe '' in the vortex core should be distinct from the pseudogap formation . </S>",

    "<S> rather , we infer that bogoliubov quasiparticles exist even near the antinode at @xmath50 and that the the missing weight is originated from the suppression of superconductivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the pseudogap or the `` nanostripe '' also develops at the same energy scale and two different orders do not share the same region in energy - momentum space , it is plausible that superconductivity and the pseudogap are nearly degenerated but competing states near the antinode  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is consistent with the heterogeneous electronic states in real space because randomly - dispersed dopants and defects locally perturb the balance between superconductivity and the pseudogap , and consequently bring about the nano - scale mixture of them . </S>",
    "<S> the observed vortex - enhanced `` nanostripe '' suggests that the vortex core is one of these perturbations that affects the competition near the antinode . since the energy scales of superconductivity and the pseudogap near the antinode change with doping </S>",
