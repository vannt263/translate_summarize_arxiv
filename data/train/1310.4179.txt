    "spiral galaxies like the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda ( m31 ) are composed of several structural subcomponents , each with its own formation history . tracing the evolution of such a galaxy ,",
    "then , depends on characterization of the individual subcomponents .",
    "this decomposition is especially difficult in the inner regions , where the cospatial bulge , disk , and halo complicate characterization of any single subcomponent .",
    "the most commonly used way to characterize the stellar component of a large spiral galaxy is via surface brightness ( sb ) decomposition .",
    "sb profiles of disks tend to fall off exponentially , whereas bulges follow more general srsic profiles @xcite .",
    "widely used sb decomposition codes such as gim2d @xcite and galfit @xcite fit a sum of a srsic spheroid and an exponential disk to the sb distribution of a galaxy to estimate the relative contributions of the components .",
    "unfortunately , such fitting is plagued by degeneracies that arise because the different subcomponents are cospatial and because the procedure generally relies on ad hoc fitting formulae that do not necessarily separate the galaxy into dynamically distinct subcomponents ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we present a new technique for decomposing the stellar component of m31 into distinct bulge , disk , and halo subcomponents .",
    "this technique can be applied to any galaxy close enough to measure radial velocities and a luminosity function of stars down to about 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "in addition to fitting a toy model ( exponential disk , powerlaw halo , and srsic bulge ) to the sb distribution , we attempt to break the aforementioned degeneracies by including an additional constraint : the fraction of stars that belong to the disk ( `` disk fractions '' ) , as measured from stellar kinematics of individual red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "we perform the decomposition using bayesian techniques so that we can identify covariances between model parameters , quantifying lingering degeneracies .",
    "two large - scale , ongoing resolved stellar population surveys of m31 make it an ideal galaxy in which to develop and test our decomposition technique .",
    "the spectroscopic and panchromatic landscape of andromeda s stellar halo ( splash ) survey has used the keck / deimos multiobject spectrograph to measure radial velocities of over 15,000 stars in m31 @xcite , including over 10,000 in the crowded inner 20 kpc @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ) survey , a five - year hubble space telescope / multi - cycle treasury ( hst / mct ) program , has so far imaged over @xmath7 stars in six filters in the uv , optical , and near - ir in the same quadrant of the disk most densely sampled by splash @xcite .",
    "the decomposition technique presented here builds directly on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former performed sb - only decompositions of m31 using two different techniques : markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling and a nonlinear least - squares ( nlls ) fitting method . in each case , the authors fit a sum of srsic bulge , exponential disk , and powerlaw halo to i - band sb profiles of the galaxy .",
    "the profiles were a composite of major- and minor- axis cuts of an @xmath5-band image of the central @xmath1 kpc of m31 @xcite plus minor - axis profiles measured from rgb star counts @xcite .",
    "they found that the best - fit bulge , disk , and halo structural parameters depended significantly on the decomposition method , data points used ( major vs. minor axis ) , and even on the binning of the data . despite the uncertain results , their model was still relatively restrictive , not allowing for a flattened halo or for variations from the canonical values in the ellipticities or position angles of the bulge and disk .    in @xcite , we performed a _",
    "kinematical _ decomposition of m31 s dynamically cold disk ( without distinguishing between thin and thick components ) and dynamically hot spheroid ( without distinguishing between bulge or halo components ) using radial velocity measurements of @xmath8 bright ( @xmath9 ) rgb stars in the inner parts of the galaxy ( @xmath10 kpc ; the region dominated by the disk in optical and uv images ) . in each of @xmath11 small spatial subregions , we measured the fraction of stars that belonged to the hot component",
    "this fraction is nonzero ( @xmath12 ) everywhere in the survey region .",
    "the origin of this dynamically hot population is unclear a priori : is it an outward extension of the central bulge or the innermost reaches of the extended halo ?",
    "on one hand , the bulge appears too small in sb decompositions to contribute stars past a few kpc @xcite ; on the other hand , cmd analyses of fields between @xmath13 and @xmath14 kpc on the minor axis reveal populations with young / intermediate ages and intermediate metallicities @xcite  quite unlike the old , metal - poor halo field stars in the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we use kinematically derived disk fractions measured as in @xcite as constraints in a sb decomposition of m31 s @xmath5-band sb profile . simultaneously fitting to the total sb profile of the galaxy and the fraction contributed by the disk may help to reduce degeneracies in the best fit parameters  and possibly understand the structural association and origin of the dynamically hot population identified in @xcite . with more constraints",
    ", we can relax some of the assumptions made in @xcite , fitting for the ellipticities and position angle of the bulge , disk , and halo .",
    "a primary challenge in our work is that our disk fraction measurements come from star count data , whereas we model the contributions to the integrated surface brightness .",
    "thus , we must convert a disk fraction in star counts to a disk fraction in sb units . in general , this conversion factor is such that the kinematical survey undersamples the disk : the splash target selection function happens to peak at magnitudes where the spheroid and disk both contribute stars , and to fall off at brighter magnitudes where only the disk contributes light .",
    "in addition , while it is easily recoverable , the selection function is somewhat arbitrary , varying across the galaxy . in order to quantify how fairly it samples the three subcomponents , we model and fit for the disk , bulge , and halo luminosity functions ( lfs ) .",
    "the model presented here incorporates stellar population , kinematics , and sb data for the first time .",
    "including complexities like the boxy bulge @xcite or separate thin , thick , and extended disks @xcite are beyond the scope of the paper , which nonetheless our analysis represents a significant improvement over using only sb profile fits to characterize a galaxy s physical components .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in  [ sec_roadmap ] , we outline the analysis procedures that will be described in detail in  [ sec_data]-[sec_analysis ] . in  [ sec_data ]",
    "we summarize the kinematical , integrated - light , and resolved stellar photometric data sets used as constraints . in  [ sec_analysis ] we present the mathematical formalism used to find the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of each of the model parameters . in  [ sec_results ]",
    "we discuss the probability distributions of our parameters , comparing them to previous measurements of m31 s structural parameters . in  [ sec_discussion ]",
    ", we show that the dynamically hot population in our kinematical sample is more closely associated with the extended halo than the central bulge , and propose that some fraction of that population originated in the disk .",
    "finally , we summarize in  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "simultaneously fitting even a simple toy model to the observed sb map , disk fractions , and lf is relatively complicated .",
    "we must process three different data sets , develop a multiparameter model , combine the model and data into a likelihood function , and sample that likelihood to obtain a probability distribution function ( pdf ) for each parameter .",
    "each of these steps will be described in detail in ",
    "[ sec_data]-[sec_analysis ] , but first we will present a brief road map to those sections .",
    "the flow chart in figure  [ fig_flowchart ] illustrates the path from data processing to model parameter pdfs .",
    "we start with three sets of observational constraints : sb profiles , the kinematically - derived disk fraction probability distribution in each of the spatial subregions , and the @xmath15 ( @xmath5 ) lf in each subregion .",
    "the processing of these three data sets is described in  [ ssec_phot]-[ssec_lf ] .",
    "as the left - hand side of figure  [ fig_flowchart ] shows , each data set has an accompanying toy model .",
    "we model the sb as the sum of three profiles : a srsic bulge , an exponential disk , and a cored power - law halo (  [ sssection_profiles ] ) .",
    "similarly , we model the luminosity function as a sum of three broken powerlaws , one each for the disk , bulge , and halo , in the magnitude range @xmath16 $ ] (  [ sss_modellf ] ) .",
    "the model for the disk fraction comes from a combination of the previous two : the disk fraction in flux units at a given location is the ratio of the disk to total sb at that location ; however , we must convert this integrated - light disk fraction to star counts using the disk lf (  [ sssection_modeldiskf ] ) .    given a certain vector @xmath17 in parameter space ,",
    "we compute the probability @xmath18 that the sb model represents the observed sb map ; similarly , we define and compute @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the probabilities that the model matches the kinematical and lf data sets , respectively .",
    "the total probability of that vector @xmath17 is then @xmath21 . ",
    "[ ssec_likelihood ] gives the equation for @xmath22 .",
    "we then sample this probability distribution @xmath22 using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler emcee @xcite , as described in  [ ssec_mcmc ] .",
    "the sampler yields a pdf of each model parameter . in  [ sec_results ] , we discuss the median values and confidence intervals of the pdfs in the context of previous measurements .",
    "the integrated - light , resolved stellar photometric , and spectroscopic data sets used in this work are described in more detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly recap the salient information .",
    "the sb map is derived from two classes of data : major- and minor - axis wedge cuts from a mosaic image , and rgb star counts .",
    "all of the profiles are in the @xmath5 band to minimize the effects of inhomogeneities such as dust lanes or the uv - bright star - forming rings .",
    "the sb data used in this work are identical to those used in @xcite , with the addition of new halo fields out to a galactocentric projected radius of @xmath23 kpc first presented in @xcite .",
    "we use the major- and minor - axis sb profiles of m31 that @xcite constructed from an @xmath5-band ccd mosaic image of m31 taken with the kitt peak national observatory burrell schmidt telescope and presented in @xcite .",
    "rather than relying on azimuthally averaged isophotal fitting , which smears together components with very different ellipticities such as bulge and disk , they cut wedges from the major and minor axes of the galaxy .",
    "they measured the median sb in each of 186 bins on the major axis and 152 on the minor axis .",
    "the sizes of the bins increased with galactocentric radius .",
    "bright stars were removed via an iterative sigma - clipping process .",
    "the quoted error bar in each bin is the rms deviation about the median value of the pixels in that bin .",
    "the locations of these bins on the sky are marked as teal circles in figure  [ fig_phot ] and in figure  [ fig_zoomphot ] , the latter zooming in on the the portion of the galaxy dominated by the bright disk and bulge .    because the ccd pixel size is @xmath24 and the telescope was not well focused during some of the observations , some of the images that went into the final mosaic image are out of focus at the @xmath25 level .",
    "( see  2 of @xcite . ) to avoid the effects of finite spatial resolution , we exclude from our analysis the two bins within projected radius @xmath26 of the center of m31 .      in the outer regions of the galaxy , where crowding is less severe ,",
    "the sb profile can be measured , up to a normalization factor , from rgb star counts .",
    "like @xcite , we have combined the extended star counts of the m31 stellar halo by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these profiles cover the range @xmath27 kpc .    the @xcite data set  which combines digital star counts to measure the sb in three fields along the minor axis of the galaxy ",
    "is identical to that used in @xcite .",
    "these fields are marked in yellow squares in figures  [ fig_phot ] and [ fig_zoomphot ] .",
    "the @xcite data set is also identical to that used in @xcite .",
    "@xcite combined the data from @xcite with faint rgb star counts to trace the minor - axis stellar distribution out to a projected radius of @xmath28 kpc .",
    "they used star counts from the isaac newton telescope , exposing typically @xmath29 s per field in the gunn @xmath30 band .",
    "these fields are shown as blue triangles in figures  [ fig_phot ] and [ fig_zoomphot ] .",
    "the final sb data set , presented in @xcite and @xcite , is based on rgb star counts from a keck / deimos spectroscopic survey of 38 fields between @xmath31 kpc in projected radius [ rather than just the 12 fields used by @xcite ] .",
    "members of m31 s smooth halo were identified and distinguished from foreground mw dwarf star contaminants and substructure in the m31 halo using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics @xcite . to estimate m31 s stellar surface density as a function of radius , the observed ratio of m31 red giants to mw dwarf stars was multiplied by the surface density of mw dwarf stars predicted by the besanon galactic star - count model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the surface density was converted to sb units by scaling to match the minor axis profile from @xcite .",
    "these fields are shown as magenta stars in figures  [ fig_phot ] and [ fig_zoomphot ] .    in summary , we have 637 sb measurements @xmath32 from 4 data sets . though the sb data are given in magnitudes , we perform the sb fits using flux units ; the conversion is given through the usual formula :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is in flux units , @xmath32 is in magnitudes , and @xmath35 is the zeropoint . to ensure consistency between datasets , we anchor the zeropoints of the @xcite , and @xcite datasets to that of the @xcite image by first fitting to the composite sb map _ only _",
    "( i.e. , not including constraints on the disk fraction ) , leaving the zeropoint as a free parameter with a flat prior between @xmath36 magnitude of the @xcite value . for each dataset",
    ", the median ( best fit ) zeropoint of the resulting posterior distribution is adopted for the rest of the analysis .    the composite , zeropoint - adjusted major- and minor - axis sb profiles are shown in the two panels of figure  [ fig_obssb ] .",
    "the constraints on the fraction of stars dynamically associated with the disk are obtained via a kinematical decomposition of the stellar velocity distribution into dynamically cold ( disk ) and hot ( spheroid , or combined bulge and halo ) components , described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we obtain spectra of 5257 stars in the inner 20 kpc of m31 using the deimos multi - object spectrograph on the keck ii telescope as part of the splash survey @xcite .",
    "the positions of the 29 deimos slitmasks are shown as red rectangles overlaid on a galex image of m31 in figure  [ fig_zoomphot ] .",
    "the targets on 19 of these masks contain targets selected from an @xmath37-band cfht / megacam image , while the targets on 5 masks were selected exclusively from the phat catalog and the targets on the remaining 5 were selected using a combination of phat and cfht data . in each case",
    ", the targets are selected based on a complex set of factors : apparent degree of isolation in the source catalog , magnitude bright enough to yield a high - s / n spectrum but not so bright as to be a likely foreground mw dwarf , and position on the sky so as to optimize the use of the slitmask . hence",
    ", the luminosity function of deimos - observed stars is different in each slitmask , but in general is nonzero between @xmath38 and peaks somewhere around @xmath39 .",
    "each spectrum is collapsed in the spatial direction and cross - correlated against a suite of template rest - frame spectra to measure its radial velocity .",
    "the velocity measurement is then quality - checked by eye , and only robust velocities ( those based on at least two strong spectral features ) are included in the analysis .",
    "we perform a number of cuts on this preliminary kinematical dataset .",
    "first , we retain only the 3247 ( 63% of ) targets that are also present in the existing phat catalog .",
    "( the other targets lie in regions on the sky not sampled by the phat survey at the time of writing . )",
    "second , we cut out the 25% of the remaining objects that are located in regions with @xmath40 mag .",
    "the low extinction regions were identified by modeling the nir cmd as a sum of a foreground unreddened rgb and a background rgb , reddened by a log - normal distribution of dust reddening , in 10 arcsecond bins .",
    "this modeling produced a map of the median @xmath41 across the disk , independent of the fraction of reddened stars along a given line of sight .",
    "details can be found in dalcanton et  al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep ) , and an overview of the technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "all of the 2443 remaining stars are redder than @xmath42 , so are likely to be rgb stars rather than bright main sequence ( ms ) objects . in the following text",
    ", we describe how we use these 2443 stars to measure disk fractions in each of 14 spatial subregions .      in @xcite , the splash and phat survey region",
    "was divided into four spatial `` regions '' : three straddling the ne major axis and one along the se minor axis .",
    "the boundaries of the regions ( lines of constant @xmath43 or position angle p.a . )",
    "were chosen such that each region contained enough splash targets to constrain the velocity distribution of the subdominant spheroid component .",
    "each region was then subdivided along lines of constant p.a . into multiple `` subregions , '' each large enough to contain @xmath44 stars but small enough that the rotation velocity of the disk component does not vary substantially .",
    "we measured the mean velocity @xmath45 , velocity dispersion @xmath46 , and fraction @xmath47 of the disk and spheroid components in each of the resulting 24 subregions by fitting a sum of two gaussians ( representing a dynamically cold disk and dynamically warmer spheroid ) to the velocity distribution in each subregion .    because in the current paper we use only the subset of spectroscopic targets also identified in the phat survey , we must combine some subregions from @xcite to have sufficient number statistics to reliably separate the disk and spheroid .",
    "the 14 subregions we use are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig_datamap ] .",
    "the subregions are named using the same formalism as in @xcite .",
    "the survey area is still divided into four regions : se ( along the se minor axis ) , and ne1 , ne2 , and ne3 ( along the ne major axis , in order of increasing projected radius ) .",
    "the subregions within each region are identified with subscripts that increase with distance from the major axis : @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in the se region , the inner south , and inner north subregions are named @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "( subregion @xmath52 is not used because it does not overlap with the phat survey region . )",
    "we fit a sum of two gaussians ( representing a dynamically cold disk and dynamically warmer spheroid ) to the velocity distribution in each subregion with the mcmc sampler emcee ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the appendix for more information ) .",
    "we allow the disk velocity distribution to change from subregion to subregion , but require that the mean velocity and dispersion of the spheroid remain constant between subregions within a region .",
    "the decomposition makes almost no assumptions about the nature of the disk , except that its velocity distribution is symmetric and locally colder than that of the spheroid .",
    "the latter is perfectly reasonable ; however , one could imagine that asymmetric drift in a stellar disk could skew the distribution of circular velocities towards lower speeds and upweighting the spheroid in the decomposition .",
    "we found that asymmetric drift does _ not _ in fact have a significant effect on the kinematically derived disk fractions .",
    "we tested the effects of asymmetric drift using the velocity distribution presented in @xcite to measure disk fractions in the major axis subregions , where the effect of asymmetric drift should be most significant . in near - major - axis subregions ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , the disk fractions computed by assuming symmetric and asymmetric velocity distributions are consistent to within @xmath56 . in subregions that are closer to the minor axis , it is difficult to fit the asymmetric function to the velocity distribution because the line - of - sight velocity measurements do not well constrain the rotation velocity .",
    "however , for the same reason , we expect the effects of asymmetric drift on the measured disk fraction to be decrease towards the minor axis .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of a star on the minor axis is independent of the circular velocity of that star , and so a slight change in the circular velocity distribution should not affect the line - of - sight distribution .",
    "therefore , we can safely ignore the effect of asymmetric drift and use a gaussian disk velocity distribution without affecting the disk fraction measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig_dor12 ] illustrates the velocity decomposition in each subregion within a representative region , ne2 , which is centered along the northeast major axis at a projected radius of about 10 kpc .",
    "note that in each subregion within the ne2 region , some nonzero fraction of stars belong to the dynamically hot component .",
    "nearly half of these spheroid stars are _ counterrotating _ relative to the disk ( that is , they have radial velocities less than @xmath57 km / s ) , and thus must be spheroid stars regardless of the detailed shape of the disk velocity distribution . in  [ sec_discussion ]",
    ", we will show that these stars are more closely associated with the extended halo than the central bulge , and that some of them likely originated in the disk .",
    "the cold fraction in each subregion @xmath58 is the ratio of the areas of the cold gaussian and the total velocity distribution .",
    "at the end of the 10,000-step mcmc chain , the disk fractions measured from the 32 walkers over the final 2000 steps of the chain are compiled and binned by @xmath59 into a normalized pdf @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig_dor12 ]    because it will be more useful to have an analytic form for @xmath61 , we fit a skew - normal function @xmath62 to @xmath61 in each subregion @xmath58 using a levenberg - marquardt minimization .",
    "the form of @xmath62 is    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    the best - fit skew - normal parameters @xmath65 , along with the medians and standard deviations of the @xmath66 distributions , are given in table  [ tab_skew ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_skew ] shows an example fit to @xmath61 in representative subregion @xmath67 .",
    "the pdfs are very well approximated by a skew - normal function : the @xmath68-statistic is 1.000 in every subregion .",
    "the uncertainties in the disk fraction measurements in each subregion are parameterized by the width of the skew - normal function ; the entire function ( not just an error bar ) will be used as a prior on the disk fraction in the decomposition presented . note that",
    "because the subregions are our smallest resolution elements in our kinematical analysis , we can not map the variation in kinematically - derived disk fraction _ within _ a subregion .",
    "however , in subregions where the true disk fraction varies significantly , the pdf is broad  in other words , systematic uncertainties in the measured disk fractions derived from finite spatial binning are incorporated into the error bars .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig_flowchart ] , we build a toy model to represent the sb , disk fraction and lf across the galaxy . in  [ ssec_profiles ] we describe our model : a 2d surface brightness profile and lf for each structural subcomponent . in  [ ssec_likelihood ]",

    "so our model parameters describing central magnitudes are @xmath141 rather than @xmath142 .",

    "the ratio @xmath181 is a constant independent of subregion @xmath58 for the bulge and for the halo , and depends linearly on @xmath128 for the disk .",

    "all six of the strongly correlated pairs , and all but four of the significantly correlated pairs , consist of two parameters describing the same subcomponent .",
    "for example , the bulge effective radius @xmath115 is significantly correlated with the bulge srsic index @xmath114 , but not with the disk or halo scale radii .",
    "similarly , the disk lf bright - end slope @xmath203 depends on the disk lf break magnitude @xmath204 , but not on the slopes or break magnitudes of the bulge or halo lfs .",
    "additionally , with a few exceptions , the sb parameters tend to be correlated only with other sb parameters , while the lf parameters tend to be correlated only with other lf parameters .      because the degeneracy between _ parameters _ is generally confined to within a subcomponent , the subcomponent sb and lf _ profiles _ are well constrained and are not degenerate with one another .",

    "one set of profiles ( bulge , disk , and halo ) is displayed for each of 256 samples drawn from the last step of the walker ensemble .",
    "the set of 256 violet lines , then , samples the entire range of bulge profiles allowed by the data ; similarly , the set of 256 red lines represents the entire allowed range of disk profiles .",
    "note that the profiles are relatively well constrained : for example , while the bulge scale radius @xmath115 and srsic index @xmath114 each vary significantly , they covary in such a way that the bulge is always small , contributing less sb than the halo at only @xmath205  kpc on the minor axis .    the lf decomposition in each of three representative subregions is shown in figure  [ fig_lferr ] .",
    "the disk ( red dotted line ) dominates in every subregion , so that it is nearly indistinguishable from the total model lf ( orange shaded region ) or observed phat lf ( blue line with error bars ) . for clarity , in this plot",
    "we only display the bulge , disk , and halo lfs corresponding to the median values of the parameters .",
    "however , in figure  [ fig_normlf ] we display the three lfs normalized in the magnitude range @xmath206 , with one line drawn for each of 256 samples in the walker ensemble . since the shape of the disk lf is allowed to change with radius , we display two representative disk lfs : one at the radius of an inner subregion ( red lines ) and one at the radius of an outer subregion ( gold lines ) . the disk lf is tightly constrained at any given radius despite the significant degeneracy between the slopes and central values of the individual lf parameters . the bulge ( violet ) and halo ( green )",
    "lfs are also relatively well constrained , especially considering that neither component dominates in any subregion sampled by our portion of the phat survey .",
    "the model fits the sb and lf data sets quite well .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_sbp_sersic ] displays the difference between the observed and best - fit sb profiles expressed in units of sb uncertainty ( a combination of poisson measurement errors and error parameter ) .",
    "the fit to the sb is very good : the magnitude error is generally less than 10% of the sb uncertainty , corresponding to a median reduced @xmath207 of @xmath208 .",
    "the fit to the lf is also acceptable , with a median @xmath207 of @xmath209 .",
    "however , the fit to the kinematics is less satisfactory ( median reduced @xmath210 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_fracline_sersic ] shows that the model overestimates the disk fraction in almost every subregion , and by more than @xmath56 in four subregions . though the measured disk fractions do constrain the model , their limited number and relatively large uncertainties mean that they have less effect on the final decomposition than the lf and sb data , which strongly prefer a small srsic component and dominant exponential component .",

    "we do not distinguish between these subcomponents ; instead , our @xmath228 srsic bulge includes all of them . as described later ( end of  [ ssec_diskf ] )",
    ", we also try to model a two - component bulge by fitting the sum of an exponential , a power - law , and _ two _ srsic profiles to the composite data set , but the highest - likelihood models are exclusively the single - srsic ones .",
    "the core radius of the halo , @xmath229 kpc , is signficantly larger than the value of @xmath230 kpc measured from a fit to the number density profile of resolved blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars @xcite .",
    "this quantity is in general difficult to measure , since it relies on tracing the halo in the inner regions of the galaxy , where the faint halo is strongly subdominant to the disk and bulge .",
    "our technique is one of the few that does not involve fixing other structural parameters or using only a single halo tracer such as bhb stars or rgb stars .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_corr ] , @xmath133 is degenerate with the power - law halo slope @xmath227 , but is very unlikely to be shorter than @xmath231 kpc and is not degenerate with any other parameters .",

    "a projected surface density power - law slope of @xmath233 corresponds to a deprojected density that scales approximately as @xmath234 , in good agreement with cosmologically motivated simulations in which stellar halos are built up via accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accretion plus in situ star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the outer slope of a @xcite cold dark matter halo also scales as @xmath234 , suggesting that stars may trace the dark matter profile  but not significantly affect its shape  at large radii .",
    "the conversion factor between disk fraction as measured in integrated light and disk fraction as measured in splash star counts ( @xmath158 in equation  [ eq : cs ] ) is @xmath235 in the subregions near the major axis and @xmath236 near the minor axis .",
    "@xmath237 implies that the spectroscopic survey is biased towards spheroid stars  not a surprise , since the spectroscopic target selection strategy prioritizes less crowded objects and spheroid stars are less likely to be located in clusters or clumpy structures . in the discussion that follows , as in the analysis ,",
    "this correction has been applied to the model so that both the model and measured disk fractions represent the fraction of stars , as sampled by the splash survey , that contribute to the disk .",
    "we discuss three classes of new results .",
    "first , we argue that a fraction of the stars in m31 s dynamically hot inner spheroid may have originated in the disk .",

    "third , we discuss the evidence for a radial gradient in the lf of m31 s stellar disk .      despite the significant dynamically hot population in the kinematical sample ,",
    "both the sb and lf data are best fit by a model with a bulge too small to contribute light in the splash survey region .",

    "figure  [ fig_lferr ] shows that the observed lf is also well fit by a decomposition where nearly all of the stars belong to the disk component . even without trusting the simple toy model decomposition",
    ", the shape of the observed lf from phat looks disklike in every subregion . the change in slope of the lf at @xmath239 corresponds to the trgb of low- or intermediate - metallicity populations at the distance of m31 . in a region dominated by an old population",
    ", the lf would drop off steeply brightward of the trgb ; only in a population with a significant young- or intermediate - age fraction ( as expected for a disk ) can bright stars such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars fill in the bright part of the lf and give it the shallow slope as seen in figure  [ fig_lferr ] .    in summary ,",
    "the sb and lf data suggest that the region sampled by the splash and phat surveys is completely disk dominated , even though the kinematics reveal a dynamically hot population in this region . figure  [ fig_fracline_sersic ] illustrates this tension : even in the best simultaneous fit to the lf , sb , and kinematical data , the kinematically derived disk fractions are systematically lower than the model disk fractions .",
    "the inability to simultaneously fit the three data sets is a sign of tension between our ( very simple ) model and the composite data set . in this section ,",
    "we propose a dynamically hot ( `` kicked - up '' ) disk component as a possible resolution , and walk through some other modifications to the model that can not resolve the tension .",
    "we have assumed that the population with a disk lf is exclusively dynamically colder than the spheroid , but this may be too restrictive . the tension between the model and the kinematics can be explained if the dynamically hot component identified in the kinematics is inflated by a contribution from stars that were born in the disk but dynamically heated .",
    "this population should have a disklike lf and follow the disk sb profile , but have spheroidlike kinematics .",
    "note that such a component is not the same as a thick disk .",
    "the velocity dispersion of m31 s thick disk is only about @xmath240 larger than that of the thin disk @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a kicked - up disk has a velocity dispersion similar to that of the halo : @xmath241 , or more than @xmath242 larger than that of the thin disk @xcite . in our kinematical decompositions ,",
    "the `` cold '' fraction includes contributions from both the thin and thick disks , whereas the `` hot '' fraction includes contributions from the spheroid and the kicked - up disk . of course , it is possible that thick disks are created via a heating mechanism similar to ( though less extreme than ) that that creates the dynamically hot kicked - up disk .    kicked - up disk stars have been seen in cosmological simulations for some time .",
    "n - body and hydrodynamical simulations predict that minor accretion events can disrupt galactic disks , kicking disk stars enough so that they would be kinematically classified as spheroid members , though they retain some of their angular momentum @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that a merger with mass ratio @xmath243 can kick @xmath198 of the disk stars into the halo ; this percentage corresponds to a mass similar to the mass accreted from the incoming satellite itself .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath244 of the halo mass in members of a suite of mw - like galaxies from aquarius consist of stars that originated in the disk .",
    "there is some observational evidence for this as well .",
    "@xcite identify m giants in the mw halo with velocities and abundances consistent with a kicked - up disk origin .",
    "m31 is in the process of merging with the progenitor of the giant southern stream ( gss ) , which likely was first tidally disrupted less than 1gyr ago @xcite , so it is possible that it hosts a nonvirialized kicked - up disk component .",
    "[ however , note that the gss progenitor was much smaller than 10% of the mass of m31 @xcite . ]    in figure  [ fig_deltaf ] , we map the fraction of the disklike stars that must be dynamically hot to simultaneously fit the lf and kinematics ( the `` kicked - up fraction '' ) .",
    "overall , the kicked - up fraction decreases with radius , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "the kicked - up fraction tends to be higher than the @xmath198 level predicted by @xcite for a 1:10 merger event , though the fraction in each individual subregion is consistent with @xmath198 at the @xmath245 level .",
    "the fraction of halo stars that come from the disk ( a different quantity from the kicked - up fraction ) varies from @xmath246  identical to the range found in the aquarius halos by @xcite . combining all subregions , in figure  [ fig_deltaf_pdf ]",
    "we show that the distribution in the overall kicked - up fraction is @xmath247 , where the spread in the distribution comes from both the subregion - to - subregion variation and the uncertainty on the mean value .",
    "the figure also shows that the kicked - up fraction is greater than @xmath248 with @xmath249 confidence .",
    "there are two subregions with outlying kicked - up fractions : @xmath250 ( with a very high kicked - up fraction ) and @xmath251 ( where the disklike fraction appears _ smaller _ than the dynamically cold fraction ) .",
    "subregion @xmath250 has a very high kicked - up fraction of disk stars : @xmath252 .",
    "it happens to be at the inner edge of the distribution of possible locations of the remnant core of the gss progenitor @xcite .",
    "the broad velocity dispersion in this region could be a recently disturbed portion of the disk , or be biased by the core itself .",
    "subregion @xmath251 sits on top of both the dusty 10 kpc ring and the gss , so many stars had to be excluded from the disk fraction measurement .",
    "while exclusion of stars in dusty regions does not appear to bias the velocity distribution , exclusion of possible gss debris is much more likely to affect spheroid stars than disk members .",
    "our decomposition is of course limited by our choice of model , and there are many plausible parameterizations of the bulge , disk and halo sb profiles . for completeness",
    ", we consider the possibility that a modified sb model could eliminate the need for a kicked - up disk component .",
    "we attempt to fit the data with four different modified sb models , but none result in an acceptable fit to all three data sets .",
    "first , we try fitting a model with a second exponential disk component with its own central intensity , ellipticity , scale length , and lf parameters . however , the most probable models in the posterior distribution are those with a single disk component .",
    "we also try using a model with a single disk whose exponential scale length is allowed to change at a break radius @xmath253 ( that is , allowing for a freeman type ii or iii profile ) .",
    "however , the likelihood values show no preference for a disk with a break .    bulgeless disk galaxies can have sb profiles that deviate from pure exponential .",
    "we try fitting a model with a disk whose srsic index is a free parameter .",
    "the resulting pdf of the srsic index has a mean of @xmath254  that is , the disk is slightly more cored than a pure exponential .",
    "this decomposition does not reduce the required kicked - up fraction .    the bhb profile can be well fit by a halo component alone if the halo core radius is @xmath255 kpc @xcite .",
    "we try fixing @xmath256 kpc , but this degrades the fit to the kinematics at large radii ( regions ne2 and ne3 ) with minimal to no improvement at smaller radii .",
    "the central region of m31 is complex , with multiple components including a classical bulge that dominates the sb within 0.2 kpc on the major axis , boxy bulge that dominates within 2.7 kpc , and bar that extends to at least 4.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "we allow for the possibility of multiple spheroidal components by fitting a model with two srsic bulges with unique central intensities , ellipticities , scale lengths , srsic indices , and lfs . however , the fit to the kinematics is not improved .",
    "finally , we try relaxing the assumption of a srsic bulge profile . the kinematics would be better fit if the bulge were more extended  if it had a shallower slope in the outer regions .",
    "however , the outer slope and inner slopes of a srsic profile are determined by the same parameter @xmath257 , which in our case is completely constrained by the inner @xmath258 ( on the minor axis ) where the bulge dominates the sb .",
    "we consider a modified srsic profile , whose inner and outer slopes are allowed to differ but whose shape reduces to a srsic when the slopes are the same . even with this added flexibility , the data prefer models with near - srsic",
    "bulge profiles : small bulges nearly identical to those in figure  [ fig_sbp_sersic ] .",
    "it is also possible that the excess dynamically hot population belongs to the virialized remnants of tidal debris .",
    "dynamically cold substructure has been seen in m31 s halo and , to a smaller extent , in the portion covered by the phat survey ; it is not unreasonable to suppose that the remnants from older satellite encounters contribute stars to the central portion of the galaxy .",
    "however , note that the debris would have to be old enough to have virialized ( because it is dynamically hot ) , but have a significant fraction of young or intermediate - age stars ( to have enough agb stars to fill out the lf brightward of the trgb ) .",
    "analysis of cosmological simulations such as eris @xcite will provide insight into the relative contributions of young , virialized tidal debris and kicked - up disk stars in the inner halos of large spiral galaxies .",
    "the location of the transition between m31 s bulge and halo has long been unclear . from images and sb decompositions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the bulge appears to be relatively small , with a srsic index of around @xmath259 and an effective radius of around @xmath260 kpc .",
    "however , resolved stellar population studies have raised the possibility that the bulge may be much bigger .",
    "deep optical hst cmds of a minor - axis field at a projected radius of about 15 kpc ( @xmath261 disk scale radii on the minor axis ) revealed a broad spread in [ fe / h ] ( @xmath262 ) and age ( @xmath263 gyr ) @xcite , more similar to the mw s bulge than to its old , metal - poor inner halo .",
    "it appeared that either m31 has a large bulge or else its halo has had a much different formation history than the mw s .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that a significant fraction ( @xmath264 ) of the stars in our kinematical sample belong to a dynamically hot population  presumably either the outer reaches of a centrally concentrated bulge or the inner portion of an extended halo . with kinematics alone , we were unable to distinguish between these two scenarios , but we are now in a position to show that the vast majority of these stars are associated with the halo .",
    "our decomposition indicates that the sb and lf profiles of the galaxy are much better fit by a small ( @xmath265 kpc ) bulge .",
    "figure  [ fig_contour ] maps the fraction of spheroid sb due to the bulge .",
    "this fraction falls below 0.5  that is , the halo dominates the spheroid sb  exterior to @xmath266 kpc on the major axis .",
    "nearly all of the splash survey region falls in this halo - dominated region . as shown in   [ ssec_diskf ] , some of these stars may have originated in the disk but have been dynamically heated to kinematically resemble halo members .    in @xcite",
    ", we found that the dynamically hot population rotates with @xmath267 , significantly more slowly than the typical spiral galaxy bulge @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that this is not necessarily a useful comparison , as the dynamically hot population is not physically associated with the bulge .",
    "a more relevant comparison would be to the `` inner halo '' of the mw , which rotates much more slowly than our dynamically hot population @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the accreted halo population in m31 resembles in the inner halo of the mw with almost no rotation , but the portion that originated in the disk has some residual rotation .",
    "we can learn more about the relationship between the bulge and halo by comparing their sb profiles to the density profile of bhb stars , a reliable tracer of metal - poor populations .",
    "bhb stars have a mean metallicity of of [ fe / h]@xmath268 , with only a small high - metallicity tail , and so are unlikely to have formed in more metal - rich subcomponents .",
    "@xcite combined star counts of cmd - selected bhb stars from the first two years of the phat survey .",
    "they showed that the density profile of bhb stars increases steeply interior to 10 kpc , but not as steeply as the density profile of rgb stars .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with theirs . in figure",
    "[ fig_bhb ] , we compare our halo sb profile and total sb profile ( combined halo , bulge , and disk ) to the bhb profile of @xcite , scaling our sb profiles to match the bhb counts at @xmath269 . the bhb / sb ratio ( which should trace the bhb / rgb ratio ) increases with radius , as found in @xcite .",
    "however , our halo core radius is large enough that the halo alone can not account for the bhb density interior to @xmath270 kpc .",
    "the disk ( and possibly the bulge ) must supplement the metal - poor population of the halo .",
    "@xcite argued that it was unlikely that a significant portion of the bhb stars belonged to the disk , in part because the kinematically - derived disk fraction in a field at @xmath271 kpc on the minor axis  where there were many bhb stars  was no more than @xmath199 .",
    "however , we now know two reasons that this disk fraction may have been an underestimate .",
    "first , the splash target selection strategy preferentially chooses spheroid stars over disk stars , underestimating the disk fraction by a factor of @xmath272 on the minor axis .",
    "second , some fraction of the true disk stars may have been kicked up so that a kinematical decomposition grouped them with the halo .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the disk then is likely quite broad : some stars belong to a metal - poor bhb population , while the faint break magnitude of the disk lf indicates a contribution from stars with solar or supersolar metallicities .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab_params ] , figure  [ fig_dfa ] and figure  [ fig_dfb ] , the radial gradient parameters in the disk lf are exclusively nonzero .    to show that a radial gradient is required to simultaneously fit all three data sets , we run a test decomposition with a _ constant _ disk lf .",
    "the resulting fit to the lf is quite poor ( median reduced @xmath273 including only observational uncertainties ) . figure  [ fig_lferr_nograd ] shows the fits in a representative sample of three subregions .",
    "most noticeably , the model predicts a number density that is too high at small radii and too low at large radii .",
    "the uncertainty parameter on the lf is driven high in an attempt to resolve the tension between the model and data , inflating the effective uncertainty beyond the poisson uncertainty .",
    "in contrast , when we allow for a radial gradient , the lf uncertainty parameter can be very small , and the structural parameters and the fit to the kinematics are unaffected ( see figure  [ fig_lferr ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that there is a radial gradient in the lf of m31 s stellar disk .",
    "such a variation could be caused by either an age or metallicity gradient , either of which is plausible : hii region abundance estimates suggest that there may be a small metallicity gradient within m31 s ( gas ) disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while inside - out disk formation and/or radial migration could induce an age gradient .",
    "as discussed earlier in the paper , the break magnitude of the trgb can be used as a proxy for metallicity : for populations with @xmath274}\\gtrsim -1 $ ] , the trgb is much more sensitive to metallicity than age , becoming fainter as metallicity increases .",
    "the shapes of the lfs in figure  [ fig_normlf ] illustrate the trend from higher metallicity at low radius ( red curves ) to lower metallicity at high radius ( orange curves ) . the same trend ",
    "metal abundance that decreases with radius  seen in m31 disk pne @xcite and hii regions @xcite . at large radii , the average metallicity of the disk is similar to that of the bulge , but still higher than that of the halo .",
    "note that this gradient exists in the old , smooth stellar disk ; it does not reflect ( and thus is not biased by ) the sharp changes in stellar population found in the narrow star - forming rings . recall that we excluded from the phat lf every star that fell within a @xmath275 pixel with a reddening @xmath40 ; as shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig_datamap ] , this cut effectively removes stars in the star - forming rings .",
    "in addition , we have cut out the few remaining stars blue enough to still be on the young , massive main sequence .",
    "we have presented the first structural decomposition of a large spiral galaxy using simultaneous sb , lf , and kinematical constraints . we have used bayesian inference to find the probability distribution functions of 32 parameters describing the surface brightness profile and lf of each structural subcomponent .",
    "we have found :    1 .   the structural parameters we measure are consistent with previous measurements . on average ,",
    "the old stellar disk is more highly inclined and its major axis pa is larger than measured from isophotal sb fitting . 2 .",
    "a decomposition including a srsic bulge , power - law halo , exponential disk and constant shapes to the bulge , halo , and disk lfs can not simultaneously well fit the sb , lf , and kinematical data .",
    "the model poorly predicts the number density of bright stars and overestimates the disk fraction in most subregions .",
    "3 .   the high kinematically - derived spheroid fractions can be explained if some spatially dependent fraction ( between @xmath198 and @xmath276 ) of the dynamically hot component is comprised of `` kicked - up '' disk stars .",
    "this kicked - up population has a disklike sb profile and disklike lf , but spheroidlike kinematics ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "4 .   in the i band ,",
    "the halo is brighter than the bulge exterior to @xmath278 on the major axis .",
    "comparison to bhb stars , a tracer of the metal - poor population , indicates that the disk metallicity distribution has a low - metallicity tail .",
    "a sb decomposition including a radially varying disk lf improves the fit to the observed lf and does not affect the structural parameters .",
