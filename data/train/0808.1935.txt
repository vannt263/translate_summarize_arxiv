    "<S> the algorithms that are adapted to the special capabilities of these devices are called quantum algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> one of the best known quantum algorithms is shor s algorithm for integer factorization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since no efficient factorization algorithm is known for classical computers @xcite , various cryptographic techniques rely on the difficulty of finding the prime factors of large numbers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in 1994 , peter shor developed a quantum algorithm that can factorize large numbers in polynomial time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery was one of the main reasons for the subsequent strong interest in quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental implementation of shor s algorithm was demonstrated by vandersypen et al . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite used photons as qubits and found the same factors .    </S>",
    "<S> while shor s algorithm and its experimental implementation are based on the circuit ( or network ) model of quantum computing , different models have been proposed later . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the adiabatic quantum computing model proposed by farhi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , the basis of this model is the quantum adiabatic theorem : a quantum system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate if the system hamiltonian varies slowly enough and if there is a gap between this eigenvalue and the rest of the hamiltonian s spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proved to be equivalent to the conventional circuit model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several adiabatic quantum algorithms have been discussed , such as 3sat and search of unstructured databases @xcite . compared to the network model </S>",
    "<S> , the adiabatic scheme appears to offer lower sentivitiy to some perturbations and thus improved robustness against errors due to dephasing , environmental noise and some unitary control errors @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a factorization algorithm that uses the adiabatic approach to quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> we also implement this algorithm experimentally , using nuclear spin qubits to factorize the number 21 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a large class of numerical problems that can be brought into the form of an optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> many of them form hard problems . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum adiabatic computation supplies a possible method for solving these problems . </S>",
    "<S> it requires an initial hamiltonian @xmath0 whose ground state @xmath1 is well known , and a problem hamiltonian @xmath2 , whose ground state encodes the solution of the optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> implementing this method requires one to first prepare the system into the ground state of @xmath3 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the hamiltonian is changed , slowly enough for fulfilling the adiabatic condition , until it is turned into the problem hamiltonian @xmath2 after a time @xmath5 . in the simplest case </S>",
    "<S> , the change of the hamiltonian is realized by an interpolation scheme @xmath6h_{0}+s(t)h_{p}\\ , , \\label{e.hsys}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath7 parametrizes the interpolation . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the optimization problem is then determined by measuring the final ground state @xmath8 of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now apply this approach to find nontrivial prime factors of an @xmath9-digit integer @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are prime numbers . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath13 is odd ( in case of even @xmath13 , we could repeatedly divide @xmath13 by 2 until an odd integer is obtained ) </S>",
    "<S> . we can write the factorization problem as an optimization problem by using the function @xmath14 , in which the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 are positive integers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the minimum of this function is reached when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the factors of @xmath13 .    to solve this optimization problem by the adiabatic quantum algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we must construct a problem hamiltonian for the function @xmath17 , whose ground state is the solution . generally , the eigenvalues of the problem hamiltonian are @xmath17 , and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are satisfied by @xmath20    to determine the hilbert space that we need for implementing this scheme , we first consider the possible range of the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 . since @xmath13 is odd , </S>",
    "<S> its factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 must also be odd , i.e. its last bit is always 1 and can therefore be omitted during the adiabatic evolution . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to prove that @xmath24 bits are sufficient to represent @xmath15 and @xmath25 bits to represent @xmath16 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denotes the largest ( odd ) integer not larger than @xmath28 , while @xmath29 denotes the smallest number of bits required for representing @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of qubits required are @xmath31 , which is less than the number of qubits used in shor s algorithm ( @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the failure probability and @xmath34 denotes the smallest integer not less than @xmath35 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using the conventional computational basis @xmath36 = @xmath37 , it is straightforward to construct the problem hamiltonian : @xmath38^{2 } , \\label{e.h_p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 represents the unit operator and @xmath40 is the pauli matrix of qubit @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> all computational basis states @xmath42 , with @xmath43 or @xmath44 , are eigenstates of @xmath2 and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath45 , in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 are represented by the bits @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath2 is @xmath48 , and the corresponding eigenstate ( i.e. , the ground state ) @xmath49 encodes the factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    as the initial hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we choose @xmath52 this hamiltonian describes a system , in which all the spins interact with the same magnetic field with strength @xmath53 , oriented along the @xmath15-axis . </S>",
    "<S> its ground state is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the parity of @xmath56 ( i.e. the number of 1s in the binary representation modulo 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is thus an equal superposition of all computational basis states , each representing a combination of trial factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the adiabatic process </S>",
    "<S> , the system evolves under the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ e.hsys ] ) according to the schrdinger equation : @xmath57 with the initial condition @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic theorem @xcite ensures that , if the evolution time @xmath5 is long enough , the quantum system will always be close to the ground state of @xmath59 , and the final state will be the solution of the problem .    as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we apply this algorithm to the factorization of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of qubits required to represent the two registers @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath61 , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the total number of qubits needed is @xmath63 . according to eq.([e.h_p ] ) , the problem hamiltonian is : @xmath64 its energy - level diagram is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sim ] ( a ) where we used @xmath65 to interpolate the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , a total evolution time @xmath66 and @xmath67 . under these conditions , the adiabatic condition is satisfied as the system evolves towards the desired final state at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue bars in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sim ] ( b ) shows the numerical simulation for the evolution of the occupation probabilities of the computational basis states @xmath69 when the whole adiabatic evolution is divided into 6 equidistant steps . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the problem hamiltonian , @xmath70 encodes the value of @xmath15 in the first bit , so @xmath71 , and the value of @xmath16 in the second and third bits , @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the real physical system ( a three qubit nmr quantum processor ) to demonstrate this algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the three qubits are represented by the @xmath73h , @xmath74c , and @xmath75f nuclear spins of diethyl - fluoromalonate . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular structure is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pulse ] ( a ) , where the three nuclei used as qubits are marked by the oval . </S>",
    "<S> the natural hamiltonian of the three - qubit system in the rotating frame is @xmath76 where @xmath77 represent the field strengths and @xmath78 the coupling constants @xmath79hz , @xmath80hz and @xmath81hz . </S>",
    "<S> experiments were carried out at room temperature , using a bruker avance ii 500 mhz ( 11.7 tesla ) spectrometer equipped with a qxi probe with pulsed field gradient .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was divided into three steps ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pulse ] ( b ) ) : initial state preparation into the ground state of @xmath82 , adiabatic passage for the time - dependent @xmath59 , and measurement of the final ground state of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> starting from thermal equilibrium , we first created a pseudopure state ( pps ) @xcite @xmath84 , with @xmath85 representing the @xmath86 unity operator and @xmath87 the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of @xmath82 [ eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int_state ] ) ] was prepared from @xmath88 by applying @xmath89 pulses along the @xmath90 axis to each qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic evolution of @xmath59 was approximated by @xmath91 discrete steps @xcite . instead of the usual linear interpolation @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> , we used a polynomial interpolation , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 integer and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary evolution for the discrete adiabatic passage is then @xmath96 where the duration of each step is @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic limit is achieved when both @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> using trotter s formula , we can approximately generate the unitary operators @xmath100 the pulse sequence for the implementation of the adiabatic evolution is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pulse](c ) .    as a suitable set of parameters , we chose the values @xmath67 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter set yields an adiabatic evolution that finds the solution in a relatively efficient way . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical fidelity is around 0.91 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the final state has more than @xmath104 overlap with the true solution state corresponding to the factors .    to read out the final state , </S>",
    "<S> only the occupation numbers of the different computational basis states are required . to measure the populations , we first applied a pulsed field gradient to dephase transverse magnetization , and then a @xmath105^{i}_{-y}$ ] read - out pulse to qubit @xmath41 and measured the resulting free induction decay signal ( fid ) . the readout procedure was applied to each of the three qubits in subsequent experiments . in the experiment , we used a sample in natural abundance , i.e. only @xmath106 of the molecules had a @xmath74c nuclear spin . to distinguish those molecules against the large background </S>",
    "<S> , we read out all three qubits via the @xmath74c channel , by applying swap gates and measuring the @xmath74c qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ sim ] ( c ) shows experimental spectra obtained by reading out the @xmath107 qubit , at different instances during the adiabatic transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum consists of four resonance lines ; in the figure , they are labeled by the corresponding logical states of the @xmath108h and @xmath75f qubits . while these four resonance lines have initially comparable amplitude , the last 2 measurements find almost all the amplitude in the line at 15.5 hz , which corresponds to the @xmath109 state of the @xmath108h and @xmath75f qubits . </S>",
    "<S> since the amplitude is positive , the @xmath74c qubit must also be in the @xmath110 state . </S>",
    "<S> the red bars in fig . [ sim ] b ) show the populations of the eight computational ground states . </S>",
    "<S> they were obtained from a least - squares fit to the spectra measured after reading out the three different qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the results confirm that the final state has a high occupation probability on the @xmath70 state , which encodes the two factors @xmath111 and @xmath112 .    </S>",
    "<S> these experimental results confirm that this adiabatic algorithm is capable of factorizing numbers . to assess its usefulness , we need to determine its time complexity . while we could not find an analytical expression for the running time as a function of the problem size , we performed numerical simulations to assess its efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each possible problem size , we randomly chose @xmath113 different integers with nontrivial prime factors . </S>",
    "<S> then we numerically integrated the schrdinger equation ( [ e.schrod ] ) by a fourth - order runge - kutta technique . </S>",
    "<S> for each run , we determined the evolution time required to reach a success probability between 0.12 and 0.13 @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nusim ] , we plot the average of these evolution times against the problem size . </S>",
    "<S> the spheres represent simulated running times , while the solid line is a quadratic fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between data points and fit suggests that the running time grows quadratically with the size of the problem , indicating that our algorithm scales polynomially and therefore may be efficient .    in conclusion , based on the adiabatic theorem , we propose a new quantum algorithm for factorizing integers . </S>",
    "<S> compared to shor s algorithm , the present method requires a significantly smaller number of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental implementation of this algorithm , using an nmr quantum simulator , shows excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first experimental demonstration of a quantum algorithm that factorizes an integer larger than 15 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a numerical simulation of factoring up to 16-bit integers indicates that this algorithm may be efficient . </S>"
