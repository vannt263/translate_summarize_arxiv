    "multisymplectic geometry provides a mathematical framework to describe classical field theory geometrically . within this formulation",
    "it is not necessary to break manifest lorentz covariance nor is there a need to use concepts from infinite dimensional geometry .",
    "the formalism dates back to the early work by de donder , dedecker , and weyl . by now the exploration of its geometrical aspects has reached an elaborated stage , and a number of excellent reviews of this are available to the reader ( @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we propose an algebraic structure that mimics closely the poisson algebra of classical mechanics .",
    "consider a classical field @xmath0 , @xmath1 with @xmath2 internal degrees of freedom over @xmath3-dimensional space - time @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the lagrange density .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are ( @xmath6 denotes the total derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath7 ) @xmath8 introducing new field variables  the _ multimomenta _  by @xmath9 and the _ de donder - weyl hamiltonian _ by @xmath10 one can easily verify that the equations of motion ( [ elg ] ) are equivalent to the _ de donder - weyl equations _",
    "@xmath11 provided certain regularity conditions hold for @xmath12 .",
    "note the remarkable similarity with the hamiltonian equations of motion of mechanics .",
    "the difference one encounters lies in the fact that there are @xmath3 multimomenta associated to each degree of freedom @xmath13 . of course",
    ", for @xmath14 one recovers the case of ( time - dependent ) hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "furthermore , as the fields are sections of some possibly non - trivial fibre bundle @xmath15 , the notion of derivatives @xmath16 of the fields does not exist in a natural way .",
    "rather , one has to use the theory of first jet bundles ( @xcite ) and  later on  their affine duals @xmath17 . for the sake of brevity we list the relevant objects occurring in multisymplectic geometry in a table , thereby comparing the individual items to their counterparts in the symplectic formulation of time - dependent mechanics .",
    "+    [ cols=\">,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the multicanonical form @xmath18 can be defined in an intrinsic way .",
    "we shall not elaborate on this but instead mention that there is a vector field @xmath19 on @xmath20 , the scaling or euler vector field of the vector bundle @xmath21 , @xmath22 that satisfies @xmath23 @xmath20 , together with @xmath24 and @xmath18 , is an example of an _ exact multisymplectic manifold_. note in particular that @xmath24 is non - degenerate on vector fields .",
    "there is a natural projection from the extended multiphase space @xmath20 to the _ ordinary multiphase space _ @xmath25 given by ( we just write down the coordinate expression ) @xmath26 the dimension of @xmath25 is one less than that of @xmath20 .",

    "( @xcite ) in their work .",
    "it shows the unpleasant feature of not carrying a canonical multisymplectic structure .",
    "however , with the help of connections in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the analogues @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the above items can be defined and one has @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an exterior derivative along the fibres of @xmath33 acting on forms on @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to study solutions of the equation @xmath34 as the multisymplectic form @xmath24 is an @xmath35-form , @xmath36 can be an @xmath37-form , @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath39 has to be an @xmath40-vector field , @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is degenerate on multi - vector fields of tensor degree higher than @xmath42 ( otherwise it would have to be the volume form on @xmath20 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath39 is not uniquely determined by @xmath36 , nor is @xmath36 fixed by @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , it is known that there are conditions on @xmath36 which have to be met for an @xmath39 to exist .",
    "these restrictions concern the dependence of the coefficients of @xmath43 on the multimomenta @xmath44 .",

    "more precisely , if @xmath48 denotes such a hamiltonian multi - vector field , then @xmath49 and if @xmath50 then @xmath48 is a hamiltonian r - vector field associated to @xmath51 multi - vector fields satisfying ( [ exact ] ) are called _ exact hamiltonian multi - vector fields_. + typical examples of hamiltonian forms will be discussed below .    as already mentioned the hamiltonian multi - vector field @xmath39",
    "is not fixed by @xmath36 . however , as we shall see in a moment , the definition of a bracket operation between hamiltonian forms will involve contractions of hamiltonian multi - vector fields with hamiltonian forms .",
    "this results in an undesirable dependence on the choice of the hamiltonian multi - vector field .",
    "we therefore restrict the hamiltonian forms further .",

    "the converse , i.e. the integration of the @xmath59 to a solution of the de donder - weyl equations can be performed if additional conditions are fulfilled ( for details , see @xcite ) .    a form @xmath60 on the ordinary multiphase space @xmath25 is called horizontal if it vanishes on vector fields that are vertical w.r.t .",

    "moreover , let @xmath68 , @xmath69 be _ commuting _ exact hamiltonian vector fields",
    ". then one can show @xmath70 and one obtains examples @xmath71 of poisson forms of intermediate tensor degree .",
    "these forms can be viewed as the counterparts to higher dimensional orbits of transformations .",

    "however , it has not been clarified yet whether there exist hamiltonian multi - vector fields that are not poisson .",
    "before we turn to the definition of a bracket operation between poisson forms let us briefly recall the canonical extension of the lie - bracket of vector fields to the algebra of multi - vector fields .",
    "this composition is known under the name schouten bracket .",
    "the defining formul   are ( let @xmath73 be multi - vector fields of respective tensor degree @xmath74 ) @xmath75&=[x , y ] \\;{{\\scriptstyle \\wedge}}\\ ; z \\",

    "we propose a modification of ( [ bracket1 ] ) which preserves ( [ antisymmetry ] ) and ( [ mvfofbracket ] ) but cures the anomalous terms in ( [ jacobi1 ] ) and ( [ equivariance ] ) .",

    "the bracket @xmath90 of two poisson forms @xmath36 , @xmath78 is again a poisson form .",

    "then @xmath100 is again hamiltonian  la kanatchikov and can be pulled back to @xmath20 , where it coincides with the bracket @xmath90 of the pulled back forms @xmath36 and @xmath78 .",
    "* while the proofs of items 1,2,3,4,6 are obvious , the demonstration of the graded jacobi identity is rather lengthy .",

    "* the definition and the proposition ( except the last statement ) do not involve any properties other than @xmath102 hence the construction can be carried over to arbitrary exact multisymplectic manifolds , in particular to the direct treatment of higher order lagrangeans ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ the notion of a poisson bracket is not completely justified as no product structure has been identified yet .",
    "one can show that a horizontal poisson form of degree @xmath37 has to be polynomial in the multimomenta of degree @xmath40 or less .",
    "hence , the product of a poisson @xmath37-form and a poisson @xmath82-form can be at most an @xmath103-form .",
    "there are two candidates for such a composition : kanatchikov s @xmath104-product @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a hodge operation on @xmath61 , acting on horizontal forms on @xmath25 , and  on the side of multi - vector fields  the map @xmath107 one can show that both maps do not coincide . while the former does yield a poisson form and satisfies a graded leibniz rule , the latter can not be carried over to poisson forms .",
    "this can be seen from the identity @xmath108 the @xmath104-product , however , can not be extended to general poisson forms without the use of a connection .",
    "moreover , the product of two functions will always give zero which makes it impossible to view it as a generalisation of the product of functions in symplectic geometry .",
    "multisymplectic geometry provides a covariant formalism for classical field theory .",
    "it uses elements from finite dimensional differential geometry throughout .",
    "there is a close resemblance to the formulation of time dependent hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "however , there are a number of features that do not occur in mechanics .",
    "in particular there is a correspondence between forms and multi - vector fields that replaces the interplay of functions and hamiltonian vector fields of symplectic geometry .",
    "forms of degree @xmath109 , where @xmath3 is the dimension of space - time , come in very naturally when considering symmetry transformations . remember that according to noether s theorem there is a conserved charge for every symmetry , and this charge is obtained through integration over @xmath110-dimensional hypersurfaces of space - time . on the other hand , as solutions of the field equations are objects of dimension higher than @xmath42 , we expect @xmath3-vector fields to replace the hamiltonian vector fields of mechanics .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "these considerations show that there is a need to have a ( poisson ) bracket operation for forms at hand , and in view of later quantisation attempts this structure should obey a jacobi identity . in this note",
    "we have proposed such a bracket for poisson forms .",
    "we have shown that all relevant examples occurring in the geometrical formulation of classical field theories are indeed poisson forms . moreover , the proposed operation does satisfy a graded jacobi identity that is closely related to the jacobi identity of the schouten bracket of multi - vector fields .",
    "we have shown that the bracket operation closes on poisson forms and contains as a particular case the gerstenhaber algebra introduced by kanatchikov ( @xcite ) . furthermore , with this structure at hand , one is now able to algebraically investigate symmetry transformations , including space - time translations .",
    "the construction is independent of the particular structure of the exact multisymplectic manifold under consideration .",
    "therefore , it is possible to apply the results to field theories beyond first order lagrangeans , i.e. to gravity as an example .",
    "it would be of interest to study the treatment of constraints in this context .",
