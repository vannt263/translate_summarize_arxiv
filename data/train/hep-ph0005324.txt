    "the study of processes with multi ",
    "particle / jet final states is of major importance not only to test perturbative qcd , but also to obtain a precise estimate of the background for search experiments . at the tevatron , multi  jet cross sections with up to six jets have been measured and compared to tree level qcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "however , leading order predictions are very unstable with respect to variations of the renormalization and factorization scales , such that the nlo corrections are necessary to obtain reliable predictions .",
    "the calculation of e.g. a @xmath1 parton process at nlo requires the knowledge of @xmath2-point scalar and tensor one - loop integrals with massless propagators and external legs , for @xmath3 one needs @xmath4-point integrals with one off - shell external leg .",
    "these integrals have to be further processed by reducing the tensor integrals to scalar integrals and , for @xmath5 , reducing the scalar @xmath2-point integrals to known integrals with less propagators .",
    "of course , reduction methods have been worked out and successfully applied before  @xcite@xcite , but mostly for integrals with massive propagators , as needed e.g. for electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "in contrast , when dealing with massless partons , the presence of infrared divergences requires a different approach . for this case ,",
    "reduction methods have been worked out  @xcite@xcite which are valid for up to 6 external legs .",
    "how to extend these results to more than 6 external legs was not clear until recently  @xcite due to problems stemming from the inversion of kinematical matrices which were singular if the external momenta were kept in four dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , the use of helicity techniques requires 4-dimensional external momenta .",
    "the main ideas how to overcome this problem will be outlined in the following , leading to reduction formulas for scalar and tensor integrals valid for an arbitrary number of external legs .",
    "consider the scalar integral @xmath6 in @xmath0 dimensions with @xmath2 massless propagators , depicted in fig .",
    "[ npo - graph ] .",
    "the corresponding expression in feynman parameter space reads @xmath7 the kinematic information is contained in the matrix @xmath8 which is related to the gram matrix @xmath9 by @xmath10 the external momenta are kept in four dimensions ; momentum conservation implies @xmath11 .",
    "the integral @xmath12 can be split into a singular part with less propagators and a finite , but formally higher dimensional integral as @xmath13 } { \\prod^n_{l=1 } q_l^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\left ( \\sum_{l=1}^n b_l \\right ) ( n - n-1)\\ , i_n^{n+2}\\ ; , \\label{eqifin2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath14 have to fulfill the following equations : @xmath15 the integral @xmath16 in ( [ idiv ] ) is a sum over reduced integrals where one propagator could be cancelled .",
    "our aim is to show that the higher dimensional integrals @xmath17 in ( [ eqifin2 ] ) , which are very hard to calculate for @xmath18 and hinder a reduction , drop out for @xmath18 . to this end",
    "we have to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eqbl ] ) for the parameters @xmath14 .",
    "note that for @xmath19 , expression ( [ eqifin2 ] ) is of order @xmath20 , which means that @xmath21 can be dropped right away in that case because @xmath22-dimensional integrals are finite for @xmath23 .    since only four 4-dimensional external vectors @xmath24 can be linearly independent in minkowski space , rank(@xmath8)=min(@xmath2,6 ) and rank(@xmath9)=min(@xmath2 - 1,4 ) .",
    "hence the case @xmath25 is special since @xmath8 is still invertible for @xmath25 , whereas @xmath9 is not",
    ". therefore eqs.([eqbl ] ) can still be solved by inverting @xmath8 for @xmath25 , whereas for @xmath26 both , @xmath9 and @xmath8 have a vanishing determinant . in this case , the solution to ( [ eqbl ] ) can be constructed in terms of the so - called _ pseudoinverse _ @xmath27 to @xmath9 .",
    "it is defined by the properties @xmath28 , @xmath29 . given a pseudoinverse @xmath27 a solution to @xmath30 exists if and only if @xmath31 .",
    "introducing a basis @xmath32 of minkowski space and defining the matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35 the uniquely defined is not unique . in our case",
    ", the uniqueness follows from the symmetry of @xmath9 .",
    "] pseudoinverse is given by @xmath36 now eq .",
    "( [ eqbl ] ) can be solved for general @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "doing so one finds @xmath37 such that the contribution ( [ eqifin2 ] ) completely vanishes for all @xmath38 .",
    "this means that all scalar @xmath39point integrals , for arbitrary @xmath2 , can  by recursion ",
    "be expressed in terms of box integrals .",
    "explicitly , one finds the following reduction formulas :    for @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 : @xmath42 for @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 : @xmath45 the reduced integrals @xmath46 are defined as @xmath47 the @xmath48 in ( [ eqscalarreductiont ] ) are free parameters to construct linear combinations of the vectors @xmath49 which , together with @xmath50 , form a basis for the kernel of @xmath9 .",
    "we chose @xmath51 parallel to @xmath52 and the others orthogonal , @xmath53 obviously one can choose the @xmath54 s such that @xmath55 @xmath56 s from the set @xmath57 are zero .",
    "doing so one observes that @xmath12 can be expressed by only 6 @xmath58-point graphs for arbitrary @xmath38 .",
    "this is the generalization to massless kinematics of a similar result in the infrared finite case  @xcite which has been derived for integer dimensions using 4-dimensional schouten identities .",
    "tensor integrals can also be split into a part containing reduced integrals ( @xmath59 ) and a part containing higher dimensional objects ( @xmath60 ) . using momentum conservation ( @xmath11 ) one can write : @xmath61 }    \\sum \\limits_{j_1,\\dots , j_{l-2l}=1}^{n-1 }   { \\cal g}(\\{r_j\\})^{\\mu_1\\dots\\mu_l}_{j_1,\\dots , j_{l-2l}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times i_n^{n+2l}(j_1,\\dots , j_{l-2l } )   \\label{36b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 are differences of reduced integrals and @xmath63 are higher dimensional integrals with feynman parameters @xmath64 in the numerator .",
    "the lorentz tensors @xmath65 present in the above expressions can be written in terms of the objects ( @xmath66 ) @xmath67 note that the pseudoinverse @xmath27 to the gram matrix @xmath9 also appears here .",
    "the important feature is that one always has @xmath68 if now the lorentz vectors @xmath69 span minkowski space , which is generically the case for @xmath5 , one immediately derives , using the explicit expresssion of @xmath27 given above , that @xmath70 this means @xmath71 and thus the higher dimensional objects @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ 36b ] ) can be dropped for @xmath5 .",
    "consequently it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 36b ] ) that for the reduction of an @xmath2-point integral only a small number of higher dimensional integrals is needed , i.e. one has to know @xmath73 only for @xmath74 .",
