    "two - dimensional freely decaying turbulence ( _ i.e. _ when an external forcing has been switched off at the initial time @xmath4 ) exhibits fascinating properties @xcite : starting from an initial incoherent turbulent background , robust coherent structures ( the vortices ) soon emerge @xcite",
    ". different types of structures can be observed : monopolar vortices rotating in either direction @xcite , quasi ballistic dipoles ( a vortex / antivortex pair ) @xcite and even rare tripoles ( a pair of two like - sign vortices separated by an antivortex ) @xcite .",
    "these vortices interact due to their mutual advection which amounts to a long - range interaction .",
    "the vortices are characterized by their radius @xmath5 and by their core ( or peak ) vorticity @xmath6 while their precise vorticity profile is not particularly relevant in the process of 2d decaying turbulence .",
    "when two like - sign vortices approach at a critical distance of the order of their radius @xmath5 , a complex merging process occurs @xcite and results in the formation of a larger vortex . as a consequence of the merging processes ,",
    "the vortex density @xmath7 decays with time while their typical size @xmath5 increases .",
    "numerical simulations of the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation @xcite and of the point vortex model presented below @xcite are consistent with experiments @xcite in finding a power - law decay of the vortex density @xmath1 , with @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 , although it is most often found around @xmath10 . for an inviscid flow , the dimensional batchelor argument @xcite which assumes that the energy per unit area , @xmath11 , is the sole invariant predicts @xmath12 .",
    "this implies @xmath13 , in clear disagreement with numerical and experimental data .",
    "however , in @xcite , and in agreement with subsequent theoretical and experimental work , the average peak vorticity @xmath14 was also found to remain almost constant during the dynamics ( see appendix [ secaturb ] ) .",
    "the theoretical determination of the exponent @xmath8 has been a subject of active research and many theories , based on different physical arguments  and leading in general to different results  have been proposed over the years @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reviewed several theories and showed that some of them are inconsistent ( except that of @xcite and @xcite ; @xcite was not reviewed , since not yet published at the time ) with the fact that the vortex typical velocity @xmath15 is constant @xcite .",
    "the vortex density satisfies a general equation of the form @xmath16 where the merging time @xmath17 is , by definition , the typical time needed for two vortices to actually merge .",
    "since we expect a power - law behavior for @xmath18 , we conclude that @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath20 which is the typical time needed for a vortex of velocity @xmath21 @xcite to travel the average inter vortex distance @xmath22 , we obtain the most general form @xmath23 where the exponent @xmath24 can not be determined on purely dimensional grounds since @xmath25 or @xmath26 are dimensionless .",
    "the area fraction covered by the vortices @xmath27 is actually the only available dimensionless quantity @xcite . now imposing energy and peak vorticity conservation , eq .",

    "( [ merg ] ) leads to @xmath13 , and @xmath32 , in clear disagreement with numerical and experimental data .",
    "hence , the necessity of a more general scaling theory arises from the fact that the two length scales @xmath33 ( typical vortex radius ) and @xmath34 ( typical inter - vortex distance ) do not scale in the same way with time . in other words ,",
    "the mean free time @xmath35 and the merging time @xmath36 are not equivalent quantities , especially at low vortex density .",
    "we now consider the effective vortex model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the exact hamiltonian for point - like vortices can be derived from the inviscid ns equation @xcite and is reminiscent of two - dimensional electrostatics @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the vortex circulations .",
    "the crucial difference with electrostatics resides in the fact that the vortex coordinates @xmath39 are the conjugate variables , so that the resulting equations of motion are @xmath40 assuming that all vortices have the same conserved peak vorticity @xmath41 , these equations are supplemented with the following merging rules consistent with ns simulations @xcite and experiments : when two like - sign vortices of radius @xmath42 and @xmath43 reach a distance @xmath44 , they merge keeping the energy @xmath45 constant , so that the resulting vortex has a radius @xmath33 satisfying , @xmath46 .",
    "the average radius then scales as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the typical distance between vortices .",
    "hence , for large time for which @xmath49 , we expect that the application of the point - like vortex model to two - dimensional decaying turbulence becomes _ more and more justified_.    the different scaling relations obtained in this work rely on the assumption that the vortices are characterized by a single length scale @xmath33 .",
    "hence , our results will be valid provided the vortex radius distribution @xmath50 is integrable or marginally integrable for @xmath51 , _ i.e. _ @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "otherwise , when the vortex size distribution is polydisperse ( for @xmath54 ) , one must introduce a cut - off @xmath55 for small radii in order to ensure that @xmath50 is normalizable .",
    "then , @xmath55 and @xmath33 will scale differently with time , thereby introducing another relevant length scale apart from @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the case",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath55 and @xmath33 scale identically , up to logarithmic corrections in the time @xmath57 , and the present theory still applies .",
    "starting from an incoherent initial background with an initial energy spectrum peaked at a certain scale @xmath58 , experiments and ns simulations show that the radius distribution remains integrable and is very often bell - shaped ( in the ns of @xcite , it is however claimed that @xmath56 ) and scale - invariant , hence satisfying @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the scaling distribution and the prefactor ensures the normalization of @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , the peak vorticity distribution is found numerically and experimentally to be bell - shaped , so that only a single vorticity scale @xmath14 must be introduced .    from now on",
    ", we place ourselves in the framework of the point vortex model described above , for which we present analytical and numerical results .",
    "hopefully , and as claimed in the two preceding paragraphs , this model is faithful enough to the original problem to apply our results to decaying turbulence in actual fluids .",
    "our first aim in section [ sec2turb ] is to evaluate analytically and numerically the time @xmath36  hence the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath8  necessary to observe a merging in the context of a purely _ two - body _ mechanism . in section [ sec3turb ]",
    ", we will then address the relevance , at least at small vortex density @xmath62 , of _ three - body _ mergings ( typically , a ballistic dipole hitting a single vortex ) , which will be shown to ultimately dominate .",
    "the numerical results of this second study will be supplemented with a fully consistent analytic mean - field three - body kinetic theory showing that the asymptotic density decay exponent should be @xmath2 .",
    "we finally apply a similar analytic argument to three - dimensional geostrophic decaying turbulence , finding an exponent @xmath3 in excellent agreement with direct ns simulations @xcite .",
    "the present work hence precisely assesses the crucial differences between a vortex dynamics dominated by two - body or three - body ( a dipole and an isolated vortex ) merging processes , demonstrating the leading role of the later at low vortex density ( the importance of three - body interactions in sufficiently dilute 2d turbulence was mentioned in @xcite and incorporated in kinetic models of decaying 2d turbulence in @xcite , albeit in a different manner ) .",
    "we first consider the effective dynamics of two interacting like - sign vortices , @xmath63 , which are also advected by the other vortices , assumed to be uniformly distributed in space but remaining at a distance larger than @xmath34 from both tagged vortices ( two - body merging mechanism ) .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in the regime @xmath64 , one can expand eqs .",
    "( [ eqx],[eqy ] ) in powers of the relative distance between both vortices , @xmath65 . after expressing the time in unit of @xmath35 and distances in unit of @xmath22",

    "furthermore , @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the effective noise due to all other vortices , and are explicitly given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the position of the center of mass of the two vortices . in the absence of the other vortices ( @xmath75 )",
    ", the two tagged vortices would rotate around each other remaining at a constant distance @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , even in the presence of the other vortices , @xmath76 as @xmath51 , since if both vortices were at the same position , they would experience the very same advection from the other vortices .",
    "the noises can be shown to satisfy @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 in our dimensionless units . moreover",
    ", these noises only vary notably on the time scale over which the other vortices travel a distance of order @xmath34 .",
    "their correlation time is thus of order @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the fact that this correlation time is non - zero ( as it would be for a standard pure white noise ) is crucial : when the two vortices are very close to each other , their mutual rotation period will become much smaller than @xmath35 , which will result in the effective averaging out of the external noises @xmath80 .",
    "finally , it appears reasonable to modelize @xmath71 and @xmath72 by effective ornstein - uhlenbeck processes @xcite with variance and correlation time both equal to 1 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are two independent @xmath84-correlated gaussian white noises , implying @xmath85 the fokker - planck equation associated to the system of eqs .",

    "this concerns the core of the vortex ( @xmath210 ) where the vorticity is maximum and the region surrounding the vortex ( @xmath211 ) which is not sampled by vorticity .",
    "therefore , the relaxation towards the fermi - dirac - like distribution ( [ w3 ] ) will be very slow in these regions .",
    "since , in parallel , the diffusion coefficient decreases with time ( because of the term @xmath207 ) , the system will not have time to reach the fermi - dirac - like distribution in these regions .",
    "therefore , mixing will be relatively inefficient in the core and at the periphery of the vortex .",
    "these arguments of kinetic theory may explain why the vorticity peak is relatively well conserved during a merging and why the vortex is more confined than what the statistical theory predicts assuming _ complete _ mixing .",
    "these arguments have been developed in sec .",

    "implies that @xmath218 inserting this expression in the l.h.s . of the fokker - planck equation",

    "therefore , @xmath220 it is noteworthy that the steady state of this fokker - planck equation is spatially homogeneous , _ i.e. _ @xmath221 , and @xmath222 in radial coordinates ."
