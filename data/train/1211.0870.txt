    "over the last decade , there has been a growing interest in studying superconductor / ferromagnet ( @xmath8 ) hybrid structures .",
    "on the one hand , this interest is due to the progress in technology that allows a controllable fabrication of nanohybrid structures using a wide range of superconducting and magnetic materials . on the other hand",
    ", this interest is due to the discovery of new and interesting fundamental phenomena , as for example the so - called @xmath9state in @xmath10 junctions josephsonbulaev77,buzdin82,ryaz , kontos , blum , bauer , sellier , palvolkovefetov , weides09 , and more recently the long - range proximity effect mediated by odd - frequency triplet superconducting correlations in s / f structures bve01,kaizer06,sosnin , birge , westerholt10,chan , blamirescience , aarts ( for an overview see refs.@xcite )",
    ".    the triplet superconducting correlations can carry spin - polarized supercurrents , _",
    "i.e. _ currents without dissipation , that can be exploited in several ways in spintronics devices@xcite . in this context , the use of tunnel barriers with spin - dependent transmission , the so - called spin - filters , may be desirable for the creation of such spin supercurrents .",
    "spin - filters are tunnel barriers with spin - dependent barrier height .",
    "they have been used for decades to generate polarized currents in spintronic circuits @xcite .    in spite of numerous works devoted to the theoretical study of @xmath8 structures",
    ", the study of the spin - filter effect in connection with the transport properties of s / f structures still remains open .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the transport properties of an s / f junction was calculated by using the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk formalism @xcite .",
    "this analysis was extend in other several workslinder , linder2,fogelstrom2000 , kalenkov09,tanaka97,kawabata10 , belzig09 for s / f and s / f / s junctions in the ballistic and diffusive limit by taking into account spin - active interfaces between the f and s layerszaitsev84,millis88 .",
    "in particular , the results for the diffusive limit presented in those works have been obtained by using the boundary conditions for the quasiclassical green functions derived in @xcite . however , as we will show in section iv , these boundary conditions can not describe the spin - filter effects and hence , none of the above mentioned works addressed the question how the spin - filtering affects the proximity effect in s / f structures . only recently , we have analyzed@xcite the effect of spin filtering on the josephson current through a @xmath11 junction .",
    "it was shown that even in the case of a highly spin - polarizing barrier , a josephson junction can flow provided the magnetizations of the f layers are non collinear .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite have been obtained from a model that combines the tunneling hamiltonian and the quasiclassical green s functions , and provide a plausible explanation for a recent experiment on spin - filter josephson junctions@xcite .",
    "note however , that the model used in ref.@xcite assumes exchange fields to be smaller than the fermi energy and therefore can not be straightforwardly generalized for the case of strong ferromagnets .    in the current paper",
    ", we present a general theory for the conductance through different hybrid structures with spin - filters as barriers , arbitrary values of the exchange field and arbitrary directions of the magnetization in the barrier and in the electrodes .",
    "we start with the model used in ref.@xcite and extend it to dissipative tunnel junctions . in the first part we focus on the study of the quasi - particle current and",
    "derive a general expression for the tunneling conductance .",
    "this expression recovers well known results in particular limiting cases and predicts new effects related to the mutual orientation of the magnetizations .",
    "we study the tunneling conductance of different junctions like @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 stands for a ferromagnetic half - metal ) . in the second part we focus on the subgap transport through a @xmath16 junction using the quasiclassical formalism . in order to quantify the effect of spin - filtering on the proximity effect we need to generalize the existing boundary conditions@xcite ( bcs ) for the quasiclassical equations .",
    "accordingly , we present a heuristic derivation of new bcs which account for the spin - filter effect .",
    "these boundary conditions can be used in a wide range of problems involving superconductors , ferromagnets and spin - filter tunnel barriers . as an example",
    ", we study the subgap conductance of an @xmath7 junction and show its suppression due to the spin - filter effect .",
    "thus , our work provides on the one hand a new powerful tool for the theoretical study of spin transport in hybrid structures and on the other hand general expressions for the conductance that can be used for the interpretation of a broad range of experiments on spin transport through spin - filters .",
    "we consider two type of junctions , first a generic tunnel junction @xmath17 as the one shown in fig . [ fig0 ] .",
    "the left and right electrodes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are either ferromagnetic @xmath5 or a superconductor @xmath20 with a built - in exchange field @xmath21 .",
    "the layer @xmath2 is a spin - filter barrier , _",
    "i.e. , _ a spin - dependent tunneling barrier . the second type of junction we considered , is a @xmath7 spin - filter junction between a normal metal ( @xmath4 ) and a conventional superconductor ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "our first aim is to derive a general expression for the current in both structures . for this purpose , we use the well known tunneling hamiltonian method , which has been used in several works on tunneling in superconducting junctions  ( see the books kulikbook , baronebook , schrieffer , wolf85 and references therein ) and in systems with charge- and spin - density waves @xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian ( hamrl ) transforms to ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) @xmath53with @xmath54 , for a exchange field directed along the @xmath55-axis .",
    "one can take into account an arbitrary direction of the exchange field ( or magnetization vector ) by means of a rotation in spin - space .",
    "we assume throughout this work that the transport takes place in the @xmath56-direction while the magnetization vector of the ferromagnets lies in the junction plane , i. e. , the @xmath57-plane .",
    "a rotation in plane is described by the matrix @xmath58where @xmath59 is the rotation angle .    in order to calculate the tunneling current through the generic junction",

    "the green s function @xmath65 is determined by eq.([dyson ] ) after neglecting the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "the exact form of @xmath65 is given in eq.([gfunction ] ) .",

    "notice that the bc condition derived in ref.@xcite contains other terms which are product of three green s functions , i.e. the higher order terms in the expansion with respect to the tunneling coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "in two recent works@xcite , golubov12 the bcs at an interface between different materials in a ballistic case were derived using another approach .    as an * example , we * use the derived boundary conditions ( [ bc1],[bc2 ] ) to study the proximity effect in a simple @xmath7 system with a spin - filtering barrier .",

    "the solution of eq.([pe2 ] ) can be easily written @xmath244where @xmath245 .",
    "thus , the amplitude @xmath242 of the induced condensate is proportional to spin - filter parameter @xmath97 . in particular the proximity effect",
    "is completely suppressed if the barrier is fully spin - polarizing ( @xmath239 ) .",
