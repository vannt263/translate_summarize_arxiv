    "in clusters containing high concentrations of massive stars ( b3 and earlier ) , binary and multiple systems provide a virtual cornucopia of information about the massive stars and the nature of their formation process .",
    "in addition to the frequency at which they occur , we may examine the distribution of several quasi - preserved orbital parameters ( e.g. , period , mass ratio , and eccentricity ) and gain insight into many open questions surrounding massive stars , such as whether they form in isolation or as part of a competing menagerie of protostars ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other issues include whether there exists an evolutionary link between massive binary systems and type ib / c supernovae @xcite , whether there is a correlation between the massive binary fraction and the stellar density of the parent cluster @xcite , whether massive binaries are responsible for the runaway ob stars @xcite , and what role these stars play in short and long @xmath10-ray bursts @xcite . previous and current endeavors to characterize the binary properties of massive stars include the galactic o - star binary study of @xcite , the galactic o - star speckle survey of @xcite , the multi - cluster o - star binary statistical analysis of @xcite , the vlt - flames studies of the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite , the lucky imaging o - star study of @xcite , the adaptive optics o - star studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the hst fine guidance sensor survey of cyg  ob2 by @xcite , and the individual open cluster binary spectroscopic studies of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these studies have found a broad range of binary fractions ( 063% ; * ? ? ? * ) and widely varying characterizations of the intrinsic orbital parameter distributions , including single power law descriptions with various indices and multiple - component descriptions requiring many free parameters . reasons for the diverse , and seemingly incompatible , results in the literature stem from the varying methodologies and biases inherent in the surveys themselves .",
    "the majority of massive binary surveys in the literature include either a small sample of o stars within a given cluster or larger samples assembled from multiple smaller surveys encompassing different clusters & associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the larger surveys have the advantage of better statistics , but the smaller surveys have the advantage of a more homogeneous sample ( same formation environment and similar ages ) .    the cyg ob2 radial velocity survey ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in prep ; papers i , ii , iii , iv , &  vi ) , takes advantage of both a large and homogeneous sample of ob stars ( 114 massive stars ) with radial velocity coverage of up to 12 years to probe the binary characteristics of massive stars .",
    "* kf07 ) analyzed the cyg  ob2 radial velocity data from 19992005 and compared the raw velocities with the expectations of monte carlo simulations over a range of mass ratio and orbital separation distributions and at varying binary fractions .",
    "they find that the likely binary fraction of ob stars within cyg  ob2 is greater than 70%  for an @xcite period distribution ( i.e. , log - flat ) and mass ratio distribution best characterized by a power - law slope of @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( depending on the choice of binary fraction ) .",
    "though kf07 are very thorough in addressing different possible distribution scenarios ( a second `` twin '' population , a @xcite distribution , a @xcite secondary mass distribution , etc ) , they are forced to make certain simplifying assumptions in their code based on the limited binary information available .",
    "a few of the more significant assumptions are circular orbits , treating all higher order systems as binaries rather than triples , quadruples , etc , and finally , that all velocity variation stems from orbital dynamics rather than stellar atmosphere line profile variations , which may be present in massive stars .",
    "assuming circular orbits can cause an underestimation of the binary fraction because fewer circular binaries need to be generated to simulate the seemingly singular eccentric systems that exist in the cluster . with regard to the next assumption , treating ( difficult - to - detect ) triple and quadruple systems as binaries still yields a meaningful estimate of the binary fraction of the cluster , as long as this term is understood to include possible higher order systems .",
    "lastly , the assumption that all velocity variation stems from orbital dynamics can lead to an overestimation of the binary fraction or an overestimation of number of massive companions , but this is an unavoidable limitation to the kf07 analysis .",
    "we present here a follow - up to the initial results of papers i , ii , iii , iv , &  vi , and the earlier analysis of kf07 .",
    "we use the results of nearly 12 years of spectroscopic observations obtained on 114 massive stars in the cyg  ob2 association to model the observed mass ratio , orbital period , and eccentricity distributions composed from the orbital information of 22 close massive binaries in the cluster .",
    "we make use of all published close binary information for the cluster , both photometric and spectroscopic , including single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) , double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) , and eclipsing binaries .",
    "we also use the radial velocity information of 110 ob stars from our original sample from @xcite to infer the binary fraction of the cluster .",
    "additionally , we examine , in more detail , an apparent excess of binary systems with periods between 3 and 5  days that have been observed in cyg  ob2 @xcite and other clusters ( ngc  6231 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the current work provides an analysis using the largest sample of massive stars and close massive binary systems ever compiled for a group of stars with a shared history .",
    "section  2 reviews the data used in this work .",
    "section  3 summarizes the method employed in this work to model the orbital period , eccentricity , and mass ratio distributions using a monte carlo approach .",
    "section  4 presents the results of the monte carlo simulations and discusses the most probable intrinsic orbital parameter distributions and the probable binary fraction of massive stars within the cluster .",
    "discussion in section  5 explores possible physical origins for the observed orbital distributions and summarizes results that may inform models of close binaries as progenitors to supernova and @xmath10-ray bursts .",
    "finally , section  6 summarizes the survey findings .",
    "we obtained radial velocities for a total of 146 ob stars over 12 years .",
    "these 146 ( given in table  1 of paper  i ) were chosen from the _ ubv _ photometric and spectroscopic survey of cyg  ob2 by @xcite .",
    "nearly half of the stars were previously identified as an ob - type and the other half had colors consistent with classification of b3 or earlier . in this work ,",
    "we utilize 110 of the 146 @xcite stars , termed the `` unbiased '' sample because they were selected on a `` binary - blind '' basis ( i.e. , no previous evidence of a companion ) . the objects in the `` unbiased '' sample average 14 observations over 1999 - 2011 with a mean velocity uncertainty of 9.7  . stars were removed from the original sample for having fewer than three observations at sufficiently high s / n needed to obtain reliable velocities ( i.e. , s / n@xmath430 where velocity uncertainties are @xmath1340 ) and for having spectral types later than b3 . additionally , we include the published orbital information for four systems not in our original sample , but likely members of cyg  ob2 : schulte  5 from @xcite , a36 , a45 , and b17 from @xcite .",
    "this constitutes 114 ob stars and is designated the `` complete '' sample .",
    "the primary components in the `` complete '' sample have spectral types that range from b3v ( e.g. , mt298 ) to o3if ( e.g. , mt457 ) and masses that range from 7.6  to 80  ( initial masses were interpolated from the stellar evolutionary models of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a mean mass of @xmath620  and mean temperature class of b0 ( 71 b3b0 stars and 43 o9.5o3 stars ) .    there are fewer stars than included in kf07 ( who included stars from table  5 of paper  i ) owing to removal of seven stars having temperature classes later than b3 ( mt196 , mt239 , mt271 , mt453 , mt493 , mt576 , and mt641 ) , 13 stars having fewer than three observations with sufficient s / n ( mt238 , mt343 , mt435 , mt477 , mt490 , mt492 , mt493 , mt509 , mt568 , mt621 , mt645 , mt650 , and mt712 ) , and one star that is a newly turned - on be star ( mt213 )",
    ". additionally , ten stars not included in the analysis of kf07 but included here are schulte  3 , schulte  73 , mt005 , mt179 , mt186 , mt222 , mt241 , mt267 , mt421 , and mt426 .",
    "these ten stars were excluded from the earlier work because they had fewer than three observations prior to 2007 . in total , this survey has produced full or partial orbital solutions for 19 binary systems . combined with the other published data ,",
    "there are 24 known ob binary systems in cyg  ob2 .",
    "the locations of the first 20 are shown by the open circles in figure  16 of paper  iv and listed in table  6 therein .",
    "the remaining 4 are presented in paper  vi .",
    "in keeping with prior works , we characterize the orbital parameter distributions as single power - laws .",
    "the mass ratio distribution is represented by @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) over a range of @xmath16 to 1 , the period distribution is represented by @xmath17 over a range of periods from @xmath18 to @xmath19  days , and the eccentricity distribution is represented by @xmath20 over a range of @xmath21 to @xmath22 . in the current approach , we constrain the indices , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath10 , by comparing the 12 years of radial velocity data , in addition to measured mass ratios , orbital periods , and eccentricities for the 22 binaries in cyg  ob2 with periods under 30  days , to monte carlo - generated binary populations . for the standard application of the monte carlo ( mc ) code , we adopt @xmath25 ( roughly representing the mass ratio of a b3v  @xmath26  m8v system ; @xcite ) , @xmath27  day , @xmath28  days , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . the period upper limit is chosen based on our observing campaign time span of a few thousand days .",
    "the eccentricity upper limit is chosen based roughly on where an orbital system becomes unbound .",
    "we show later that our results are not sensitive to the exact choices for these upper and lower bounds , the main exception being that the inferred binary fraction does depend on the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "we created synthetic binary populations using monte carlo ( mc ) methods by randomly drawing periods , mass ratios , and eccentricities from power - law distributions with indices ranging from -2 to 2 in increments of 0.1 , with binary fractions ranging from 20%100%  in increments of 5% .",
    "the mc code then generates a 4-dimensional parameter space composed of @xmath31 distinct `` families '' that are described by unique combinations of each parameter . during each iteration ,",
    "radial velocities are calculated for a group of 110/114 synthetic stars whose primary masses are determined from the adopted values for cyg  ob2 primaries . the number of synthetic velocities for each system is determined by the actual number of observations for each given star in the survey .",
    "the code samples the synthetic velocity curve at intervals corresponding to the actual observing cadence for that star .",
    "if the system is , at random , designated a binary , a mass ratio , eccentricity , and period are drawn from the power - law distributions characterized by the family currently being examined . an inclination is randomly drawn from a probability distribution described by @xmath32 over an interval of 0 to @xmath33 , representing a random orientation on the unit sphere @xcite . the orbital phase and angle of periastron are randomly drawn from uniform distributions over their allowed values ( i.e. , 02@xmath34 ) .",
    "the code adds gaussian noise to each simulated radial velocity , where the magnitude of the noise is set by the observational uncertainty from the actual observations of the selected star .",
    "for example , when a system representing mt720 is simulated , a primary mass of 17.5  is used and 32 radial velocities are calculated using the dates and errors listed in table  [ xx.tab ] .",
    "finally , the code produces 300 realizations of each family , designated a `` generation '' .",
    "we compare the average properties of each generation to the cyg  ob2 data .",
    "we constrain the binary fraction by comparing the @xmath35 probability density function ( pdf ) for the simulated radial velocities to that of the unbiased sample of cyg  ob2 stars .",
    "we use the same method described in paper  i , where the probability corresponds to the likelihood that the @xmath35 for each star s radial velocity measurements , as considered around the weighted mean velocity , would be exceeded by chance given @xmath36 degrees of freedom .",
    "we compare the observed @xmath35 pdf to simulated ones for each generation using a 2-sided kolgorov - smirnov ( k  s ) test . in our tests of the code",
    ", we were able to recover the binary fraction of a simulated dataset to within @xmath37% .    in order to compare the monte carlo distributions of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 with the observed ones ,",
    "it was necessary to apply a series of filters to the synthetic data to remove all binary systems with orbital solutions undetectable by this survey ( i.e. , the systems are designated `` single '' and the orbital parameters are not included in the final distributions ) .",
    "we first eliminate all synthetic systems have @xmath35 probabilities @xmath135% ; such systems either have large errors , few measurements , and/or small velocity amplitudes that preclude full orbital solutions .",
    "the next filter removes all synthetic systems that have a semi - amplitudes @xmath4115  , the minimum semi - amplitude for which we can derive a complete orbital solution given typical velocity uncertainties . in exceptional cases where the stellar lines are narrow , we are able to do better .",
    "for example , mt174 , with @xmath42  ( paper  vi ) , has the smallest velocity semi - amplitude yet measured in the survey .",
    "finally , we retain only systems that have periods within the 1.526.5  day range covered by the 19 systems with orbital solutions where our survey is highly complete ( see section  4.1 ) .",
    "the final mean extracted synthetic orbital parameter distributions for each generation are then compared to the observed ones using 2-sided k  s tests .",
    "the final best - fit combination of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath10 is determined by product of the resultant individual k  s probabilities for each of the three parameter distributions .    in our testing of the code , we produced a series of simulated datasets ( i.e. , orbital parameter distributions and ephemerides ) , similar to the cyg  ob2 dataset , covering a large range of possible @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath10 combinations and binary fractions .",
    "the power - law indices ranged from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( and the mc code search grid was increased accordingly ) and binary fractions ranged from 20%  ( the absolute minimum binary fraction of the cyg  ob2 sample based on current observations ) to 100% .",
    "the simulated datasets were constructed using the observation cadences , velocity uncertainties , and primary masses from the cyg  ob2 data .",
    "the code was able to recover the original distribution indices to within @xmath450.3 rms and the original binary fraction to within 5% rms .",
    "the magnitude of the uncertainty on each index is limited by the current sample size of n=22 systems having orbital solutions .",
    "the uncertainty on the binary fraction is limited by the mean number of observations per object and the mean observational uncertainty .",
    "while our current approach explores a larger parameter space than kf07 , incorporates eccentric orbits , and utilizes the information of 22 close massive binary systems in addition to the radial velocity information of 12 years of spectroscopic observations , there are still several limitations stemming from our modeling approach , our dataset , and our current knowledge of cyg  ob2 .",
    "* limitations owing to our modeling approach : * as in kf07 , we still consider all velocity variation as stemming from orbital dynamics rather than atmospheric phenomena such as pulsations .",
    "@xcite show that pulsations in evolved early - type stars can significantly affect radial velocity measurements , meaning that this effect may add scatter to radial velocity measurements in roughly one - quarter of our sample .",
    "we also still treat higher order systems as binaries . at present ,",
    "we know of three triple or higher order systems , cyg  ob2  no.5 , cyg  ob2  no.8 , and mt429 ( see references in table  6 of paper  iv ) .",
    "in addition , we limit characterization of each orbital parameter distribution to a single power - law , an assumption that may not hold .",
    "* limitations owing to the dataset : * as mentioned , the cyg  ob2 radial velocity survey probes binary systems with periods ranging from one day to a few thousand days , meaning we are not sensitive to extremely close ( and extremely rare ) systems with @xmath461 d. therefore , the mc code only draws from period distributions with periods ranging 1 to 1000  days .",
    "additionally , the vast majority of spectroscopic observations were obtained june through november when cygnus is visible to northern latitudes .",
    "this , coupled with typical velocity uncertainties of 9.7  , reduces our sensitivity to long period , high eccentricity systems ( i.e. , systems that may pass through periastron and exhibit their largest velocity variation during an unobservable period ) , systems with extreme mass ratios , and systems with small inclination angles . even though we have detected and computed solutions for systems with semi - amplitudes as small as 9  ( paper  vi ) , we attempt to circumvent these limitations by designating systems in the code with semi - amplitudes smaller than @xmath47  as `` single '' .",
    "another limitation comes in the form of not being able to detect unresolved sb2s . for systems exhibiting highly blended line profiles ( even at quadrature ) , such as long period binaries with mass and luminosity ratios near unity",
    ", radial velocity variations of the blended line profile will be small and possibly undetectable at the resolution of the spectra in this survey , thereby being designated as `` single '' by the code .",
    "@xcite discuss this effect in their analysis of the massive star binary fraction of ngc  6611 and conclude that the effect is minimal ( affecting their modeling of the binary fraction by only a few percent ) . additionally , there is also a negligible bias toward detecting short - period , high - mass - ratio systems that show up as sb2s as it only takes one observation at quadrature to determine that the system warrants follow - up .",
    "these systems , however , have large velocity separations ( i.e. , large semi - amplitudes ) and will get flagged as a `` binary '' by the code with only a few observations .    *",
    "limitations owing to incomplete knowledge of cyg  ob2 : * a few studies have shown that cyg  ob2 may be contaminated by an older population of stars , meaning that evolutionary effects may be present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite point out that the field star contamination is likely composed of f to late b stars at a radius of 1 degree .",
    "this exceeds the radial extent of the region examined in this study and concerns stars of a later type than are included here .",
    "on the other hand , some doubt remains in the membership of the 114 ob stars included in this work as recent findings by @xcite and @xcite provide conflicting distance estimates to cyg ob2 based on their complete orbital solutions calculated for the eclipsing sb2s , cyg  ob2  no.5 ( @xmath61  kpc ) and b17 ( 1.51.8  kpc ) respectively .",
    "we maintain that the contamination is minor , if it exists , owing to the localized region we examine , but even the removal of a few periods or mass ratios could influence the distributions we observe at present .",
    "similar to this is the assumption that the members of cyg  ob2 have a common age .",
    "it has been suggested that even within the core region of cyg  ob2 , there has been more than one epoch of star formation @xcite .",
    "there are no clear predictions for how a population of close binaries should evolve over the 15 myr lifetime of most massive stars in young clusters , so we have no way to model such effects or even know if they are important .",
    "we use the monte carlo code in conjunction with the `` complete '' sample of cyg  ob2 data to infer the underlying distribution of orbital parameters , that is , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath10 . the orbital parameter information ( but not ephemerides ) for schulte  9 and mt070",
    "are excluded given their much longer periods . in order to address the binary fraction ,",
    "however , we use the data of the `` unbiased '' sample . ultimately , we find that the orbital parameter indices and binary fraction are essentially identical for both the `` unbiased '' and `` complete '' samples .      binary surveys that examine the orbital period distribution probe widely varying ranges in period / separation and stellar mass , and they find widely varying characterizations of its functional form . for solar - type stars with periods from 110,000 +  days , @xcite",
    "find a log - normal distribution . among massive stars ,",
    "most studies find a uniform distribution in log space ( @xmath48 ) , sometimes known as an @xcite distribution .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath49 for a large number of galactic o - star binaries in the northern hemisphere .",
    "@xcite also find an pik s distribution for a survey of visual and spectroscopic binaries in sco  ob2 composed of a- and b - type primaries ( for 0.7  days  @xmath50  days ) .",
    "@xcite speculate that rather than a simple power - law distribution for o - star binaries , there may be a concentration of systems having periods between 2 and 5 days .",
    "the o - star binaries of ngc  6231 show this trend @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite conclude that a broken pik distribution provides a better description of the period distribution for spectroscopic o - binaries in nearby clusters , where the broken distribution could better explain the higher concentration of systems with periods less than 10  days .    the observed orbital period , eccentricity , and mass ratio distributions for the 22 known close massive binaries in cyg  ob2 are shown in figure  [ disthist ] .",
    "the orbital period and mass ratio distributions from @xcite are also shown and represented by the dotted lines in the upper and lower panels , respectively .",
    "the cyg  ob2 and @xcite period distributions show a concentration between 3 and 5  days ( with a peak around 45  days for cyg  ob2 ) . a possible explanation for such a concentration might be observational bias owing to the average observing",
    "run lasting a few days to a week .",
    "three systems in cyg  ob2 with periods between 3 and 5  days originate from other studies ( mt421 , mt429 , and b17 ) where this may be the case .",
    "however , the remaining five systems in this period range originate from our study which has a time coverage of up to 12  years and individual observing run durations of 13 weeks .",
    "this allows for a sensitivity to orbital periods up to 25  days without appreciable bias .",
    "this abundance of 35 day systems is not limited to the sb2s having the largest mass ratios either .",
    "three of the nine sb1s in cyg  ob2 also have periods that are in the 45  days range .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ peq ] , which shows eccentricity versus orbital period ( upper panel ) and mass - ratio ( lower panel ) versus orbital period .",
    "the sb1s and sb2s are the open and filled circles respectively , and the asterisks represent the orbital periods and eccentricities for the massive star binaries ( primaries of type b3 and earlier ) in the ninth spectroscopic binary catalog @xcite .",
    "one can easily see the concentration of points around 35  days and a peculiar shortage of systems with periods from 714  days in the cyg  ob2 data .",
    "an initial hypothesis for this shortage of points might be that completeness plays a role .",
    "however , with multiple studies with varying observing cadences contributing to the catalog of binaries in cyg  ob2 , we maintain that a more likely observation would be to see a continually diminishing number of binary detections with increasing period as completeness declines .",
    "given the existence of this excess in periods around 35  days , we caution that a simple power - law may be insufficient to describe the distribution of orbital periods for early - type stars in this cluster .    in figure",
    "[ biased1 ] , we show the results from the monte carlo analysis of the 22 close ob binaries in the `` complete '' sample .",
    "the four panels display the @xmath51 ( 68.3% ) , @xmath52 ( 95.4% ) , and @xmath53 ( 99.7% ) contours relative to the maximum for the average probability of a generation as a function of two parameters for fixed best - fit values of the remaining two parameters .",
    "for example , the upper left panel shows the average probability as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath10 for fixed best - fit values of @xmath24 ( 0.2 ) and @xmath54 ( 45% ) .",
    "the upper right panel similarly shows the average probability as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath10 for fixed best - fit values of @xmath23 ( -0.1 ) and @xmath54 ( 45% ) .",
    "the cross in each panel marks the location of the best fit for each parameter ( i.e. , the maximum of the average probability ) .",
    "we find that the period distribution is confined at the 1@xmath55 level to @xmath56 , with a best fit of @xmath57 .",
    "this points to a nearly log - flat distribution , consistent with pik s law @xcite , consistent with the previous o - star findings of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and kf07 .",
    "figure  [ pdist ] shows the cumulative period distribution of the cyg  ob2 data ( diamonds ) and the best fit cumulative period distribution from the mc code ( solid curve ) .",
    "the hump in the distribution at @xmath58 or @xmath59  days greatly influences the fit shown , and it is clear that a power - law of @xmath48 might be a better fit if this hump were not present or less pronounced .",
    "indeed , no single power - law provides a good fit to the cumulative period distribution .",
    "we address the peculiar nature of the period distribution in section  5 .",
    "figure  [ completeness_per ] shows the survey completeness as a function of orbital period for the best - fitting power - law indices .",
    "we use the mc code to estimate the survey completeness by tallying the fraction of synthetic systems deemed detectable in our survey given the time sampling and velocity semi - amplitude limit of @xmath60 .",
    "the survey is 88% complete at @xmath61 days and @xmath62%complete at @xmath63  days .",
    "our completeness analysis implies that , given 14 detected binaries with periods @xmath64 days , there are an additional 12 undetected binary systems in this range .",
    "statistically , the monte carlo code shows that all of these would be undetectable by the survey because they have some combination of low inclination , small mass ratio , large eccentricity , and larger radial velocity uncertainties .",
    "if , for the sake of argument , we ignore the excess of short - period systems and assume that the @xmath49 power - law holds , the @xmath615 binaries in the 110 day period range would imply an equivalent number between 10 and 100 days .",
    "there are 8 known systems in this range , leaving an additional 7 putative binaries as undetected .",
    "the mean completeness over this range is @xmath65% , suggesting that @xmath612 of the 15 would be detectable by our survey .",
    "this implies that the ongoing cyg  ob2 survey should uncover as many as @xmath65 additional binaries with periods between 10 and 100 days , given sufficient long - term data .",
    "for periods longer than 100 days , where there are presently only two systems with orbital solutions , schulte  9 @xcite and mt070 ( paper  vi ) , detection becomes more difficult . in the case of schulte  9 , with a period of @xmath62.355  years and an eccentricity of nearly 0.7 , even an observing campaign such as this one experienced difficulty in uncovering this massive `` twin '' system .",
    "all of the foregoing discussion , however , assumes an pik period distribution , and we have already shown in figure  [ pdist ] that no single power - law adequately reproduces the data at the shortest periods , @xmath46 14 days .",
    "observationally , binaries with solar - type primaries and periods longer than a year have a broad distribution of orbital eccentricities with a median value of 0.55 @xcite . for periods shorter than this ,",
    "these systems have a higher concentration near zero eccentricity stemming from circularization of the orbits .",
    "this is also shown to be true for o - star binaries with periods as long as 10,000  days @xcite .",
    "although the method by which binary orbits are circularized and the critical period below which all are circular is unclear from existing data , a standard eccentricity versus period scatter diagram , like figure  [ peq ] , illustrates that binaries with short periods do tend toward nearly circular orbits .",
    "the figure shows a decline of mean eccentricity for periods under 10  days .",
    "@xcite found that nearly all ( 92% ) early - type binaries with periods shorter than two days had an eccentricity less than 0.05 .",
    "they also found that the eccentricities of nearly all of the early - type binaries in their survey could be explained by the @xcite tidal theory , which describes the circularization time for an equal mass binary with an initial eccentricity of @xmath66 as being related to the main sequence lifetime of that binary . @xcite",
    "provide a modified version of the @xcite theory and address the evolution of the orbital parameters over the circularization time of the orbit .",
    "the circularization timescales are , on average , a third of those predicted by @xcite and in better agreement than the predictions of @xcite with the massive star binary statistics of @xcite .",
    "the predicted circularization time for an early - type ( pair of b0v stars ) , nearly equal - mass binary at a separation comparable to the cyg  ob2 early b - type binaries ( e.g. , @xmath670.16  au for mt720 ) is close to the main - sequence lifetime of an early b star .",
    "however , a study by @xcite found that there are a significant number of early - type binaries with periods up to 10  days with an eccentricity near zero that can not be explained with the @xcite theory and are unlikely to have been primordially circular .",
    "@xcite have proposed a method by which orbits become significantly circularized during the star formation process , thereby diminishing the conflict between circularization time and the theoretical life span of massive stars .",
    "however , the theory assumes the binary is formed concurrently with the formation of the components , and that is a highly debated topic in massive star formation theory @xcite .    in figure  [ edist ]",

    "we therefore suggest that the binary fraction among massive stars may be as high as @xmath118%  if periods as long as 10@xmath119  years are allowed .",
    "in addition to exploring the effect of varying @xmath19 , we also examined the effect of varying @xmath16 and the semi - amplitude detection threshold , @xmath120 , in the mc code .",

    "we conclude that the minimum semi - amplitude for binary detection is appropriately set at 15 .    in the case of increasing @xmath16 , the lowest mass ratio simulated in the code , we primarily expect to see a decrease in @xmath23 and a decrease in the binary fraction .",
    "binaries will have more massive companions and semi - amplitudes will be larger , meaning that a smaller fraction of binary systems will be deemed undetectable in the code .",

    "we do not believe this peculiar distribution can be attributed to observational biases given the extended time coverage of this survey and the different observing cadences of the observing runs that have contributed to the cyg  ob2 binary catalog . while the existence of an excess of systems with periods of around 35  days seems well - established in the literature and in our present data , the possibility of a shortage in the 714 day range has not been previously noted .",
    "a comparison between the cyg  ob2 cumulative period distribution with the data from @xcite reveals a flattening in this 714 day range ( though we should be cautious given the use of a standard histogram and small numbers ) .",
    "their survey ( of 28 systems ) contains three in this 714 day range while ours ( 22 systems ) contains one .    while we find that no single power - law can adequately describe the log - period distribution in cyg  ob2 , it is unlikely , given any power - law distribution , to find so few systems between 7 and 14 days .",
    "we examined the probability that only a single system would be observed in the 714 day period range given a random drawing of 22 systems with @xmath129  days ( for @xmath130 - 1 to 1 ) .",
    "random samples were drawn 10,000 times and the final percentages were adjusted for a 90%  completeness level ( the mean level as measured in figure  [ completeness_per ] for the 714  day range ) .",
    "the likelihood of detecting a single system for @xmath48 is @xmath62% .",
    "however , if the power - law describing the log - period distribution is assumed to be closer to @xmath131 , then the probability rises quickly to @xmath613%(with @xmath132%  for @xmath133 , and @xmath134%  for @xmath1300.5 and 1 ) .",
    "this tells us that if the power - law(s ) that describe the log - period distribution have @xmath135 , the shortage is a real phenomenon at the 2@xmath55 level .    in an attempt to replicate the cyg  ob2 period distribution with a physically motivated prescription , we made a version of the monte carlo code to take 70%  of the systems assigned a period between 7 and 14  days and reassign them assuming the same power - law describing the rest of the distribution to periods between 3 and 5  days .",
    "the 70%  reassignment fraction reflects a 90%  completeness level and detection of one out of a probable 3 or 4 systems in this range .",
    "this approach approximates what would happen if binary systems with periods 7 and 14  days migrated to shorter periods .",
    "the best fit using this approach is shown in figure  [ pdist_hump ] and comes from reassigning systems with a period between 7 and 13.5  days to a period between 4 and 5  days ( corresponding to the peak of the excess in the cyg  ob2 distribution ) with only a slight increase in @xmath24 ( 0.5 and within the uncertainty of our results ) .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath10 , and the binary fraction are same as in section  4 . the normalized cumulative distribution for the cyg  ob2 data is represented by the diamonds and the solid curve represents the normalized cumulative period distribution for the best fit using this version of the mc code .",
    "though this fit requires a slightly more positive slope for the initial period distribution , the overall fit to the data is visually better than in figure  [ pdist ] , and the multiple changes in the slope are also replicated well . a two - sided k  s test yields a compatibility of greater than 99%  ( compared to @xmath660%  with the simple power - law approach ) .",
    "a plausible explanation for such period migration could be the mechanism proposed by @xcite whereby the circularization of the orbit occurs primarily during the formation process instead . in figure  [ pq30 ]",
    "we show the evolution of orbital period / semi - major axis and mass ratio for a binary system with a total mass of 30  m@xmath136 as the primary loses mass to the secondary .",
    "the plotted curves show tracks of constant angular momentum as systems evolve toward shorter periods with mass ratios approaching unity , assuming that mass and angular momentum are conserved ,    @xmath137    ( e.g. , equation 8 of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath138 and @xmath139 are the initial semi - major axis and mass ratio while @xmath140 and @xmath38 are the final semi - major axis and mass ratio after mass transfer .",
    "the two solid curves are tracks for systems with initial mass ratios @xmath141 and initial periods of 7 and 14 days .",
    "these systems may end up having mass ratios near unity , but their final periods are longer than 5 days .",
    "the dotted curves are tracks for systems that begin with mass ratios @xmath142 and periods of 7 and 14 days .",
    "these systems may end up with mass ratios near unity and periods in the range 35 days .",
    "this is precisely where we observe an excess of systems with short periods in cyg  ob2 , and we also find a relative abundance of systems with mass ratios @xmath1430.80.9  not exactly `` twins '' , but systems where significant mass transfer may have taken place .",
    "this figure indicates that , if the @xcite mechanism is the operative one producing an abundance of short - period , high-@xmath38 systems , then some fraction of the population of 35 day systems should originate as systems with @xmath144 with 714 day periods . while the evidence for `` missing '' 714 day systems in cyg  ob2 is compelling , we can not claim , on the basis of the present data , to see the corresponding lack of systems with @xmath144 .",
    "our survey is sufficiently incomplete in this mass ratio range that observational biases preclude any firm conclusion .",
    "the cyg  ob2 radial velocity survey originated as an observational effort to inform theoretical models predicting the frequency of energetic events like supernova and @xmath10-ray bursts that may have close binaries as progenitors . a key ingredient of these modeling efforts is the fraction of massive stars that might interact through mass transfer or undergo a common envelope phase , especially during the post - main - sequence evolution of either star in the system .",
    "red supergiants are the descendants of massive stars , so we adopt the rsg radii deduced by @xcite which range between 200 r@xmath136 and 1500 r@xmath136 .",
    "their figure  3 shows stellar evolutionary tracks indicating that stars in the mass range 15  30 m@xmath136 may reach or exceed 1000 r@xmath136 while stars with initial masses over 10 m@xmath136 can generally be expected to reach 500 r@xmath136 .",
    "we adopt 500 r@xmath136 as a maximum evolved radius for stars in our sample , meaning that systems with semi - major axes smaller than this value will interact strongly , probably through the formation of a common envelope .",
    "other systems may interact via mass transfer after roche lobe overflow .",
    "@xcite provides an analytic description of the roche lobe radius as a function of mass ratio .",
    "his tabulated values show that the roche lobe radii for binary systems with mass ratios @xmath1450.2  1.0 fall in the range 0.38@xmath140  0.55@xmath140 where @xmath140 is the separation of the components .",
    "consequently , we adopt 1000 @xmath146 ( 4.7 a.u . ) as a conservative threshold separation , below which systems are deemed to interact during the evolution of the system . in our monte carlo code , we flag all systems with periastron distances less than 1000 @xmath146 as capable of interaction . assuming @xmath90 , @xmath147 , @xmath68 , and @xmath115  years ,",
    "this predicts that 45%  of the binary systems will have sufficiently close companions to interact during the binary s lifetime ( 37%  if we adopt the slightly larger @xmath148 from section  5.1 ) .",
    "the luminous contribution from secondary stars , which are unresolved in photometric surveys , even with the @xmath149 or adaptive optics , is not negligible .",
    "consequently , measuring accurate distances to star clusters using spectroscopic parallax , main sequence fitting , or similar standard - candle techniques is systematically in error if close companions are neglected .",
    "as part of our monte carlo code we tallied the mean v - band light contribution from primary and secondary stars by using a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) relation between stellar mass and absolute v magnitude @xcite .",
    "for the best fitting power law indices described above , allowing for periods as long as 10@xmath119 yr , we find that the secondary stars contribute 16% of the total stellar light at v - band .",
    "this is equivalent to a systematic error in the distance modulus of 0.16 mag and a systematic distance error of about 8% , in the sense that distances derived without correcting for luminous secondaries will be too small .",
    "we expect the secondary luminosity fractions in evolved populations to vary stochastically about this 16% zams value as the primary and secondary components throughout the population become giants and supergiants .",
    "the intricacies of mass exchange between components will further limit any simple description of the time evolution in the nominal zams value .",

    "we present these findings in the anticipation that they , along with the analyses of other clusters ( such as the work with sco ob2 by @xcite , ngc  6231 by @xcite , ngc  2244 by @xcite , and ngc  6611 by @xcite ) , will aid our understanding of numerous issues involving massive stars , including their formation , the predicted rates of supernovae type ib / c arising through binary channels , and whether there is a correlation between cluster density and the binary fraction therein . this ongoing survey will continue to uncover massive spectroscopic binaries in cyg  ob2 .",
    "these new sb1s and sb2s will help refine our characterization of the orbital parameter distributions and increase our understanding of the nature of the excess in orbital periods between @xmath635  days .",
    "while the present data has provided solid constraints on the massive binary characteristics in cyg  ob2 , it is possible that the binary fraction or distribution of periods / mass ratios / eccentricities varies temporally as a cluster ages or is a function of initial cluster density .",
    "discerning whether these additional variables are important will require more extensive surveys over a range of age and formation environment .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the helpful advice and attention to detail we received from our referee in the process of making this a much better manuscript .",
    "we thank mark krumholz and hans zinnecker for inspiring conversations about phenomena in short - period binaries , chris fryer for helpful discussions regarding interacting binary systems , and saida caballero - nieves for sharing her imaging data of cyg  ob2 in advance of publication .",
    "we are very appreciative for the continued advice and encouragement throughout the project from ginny mcswain .",

    "<S> this work provides a statistical analysis of the massive star binary characteristics in the cygnus  ob2 association using radial velocity information of 114 b3o3 primary stars and orbital properties for the 24 known binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these data to a series of monte carlo simulations to infer the intrinsic binary fraction and distributions of mass ratios , periods , and eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> we model the distribution of mass ratio , log - period , and eccentricity as power - laws and find best fitting indices of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these distributions indicate a preference for massive companions , short periods , and low eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that the binary fraction of the cluster is @xmath3%  if all binary systems are ( artificially ) assumed to have p@xmath41000 days ; if the power - law period distribution is extrapolated to @xmath5 years , a plausible upper limit for bound systems , the binary fraction is @xmath690@xmath7% . of these binary ( or higher order ) systems </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath645% will have companions close enough to interact during pre- or post - main - sequence evolution ( semi - major axis @xmath84.7 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> the period distribution for @xmath9  d is not well reproduced by any single power - law owing to an excess of systems with periods around 35  days ( 0.080.31  au ) and a relative shortage of systems with periods around 714  days ( 0.140.62  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the idea that these longer - period systems evolved to produce the observed excess of short - period systems . </S>",
    "<S> the best fitting binary parameters imply that secondaries generate , on average , @xmath616% of the v - band light in young massive populations . </S>",
    "<S> this means that photometrically based distance measurements for young massive clusters & associations will be systematically low by @xmath68% ( 0.16 mag in the distance modulus ) if the luminous contributions of unresolved secondaries are not taken into account . </S>"
