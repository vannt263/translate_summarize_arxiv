    "additionally , an astrophysical gw background ( agwb ) is expected to be produced by the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources since the beginning of star formation ( schneider et al .",
    "2000 ; regimbau & mandic 2008 ) .",
    "there have been a host of literatures dedicated to the studies of various agwb sources , such as core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) @xcite , leading to the formation of neutron stars ( nss ) ( coward et al .",

    "we revisit the possibility that the r - mode instabilities in newly born nss could form a sgwb .",
    "nss , having long been considered to be likely observational sources for gw detection , emit gravitational radiation in a number of ways , for example , through ccsne , inspiralling compact binaries , rotating deformed stars , oscillations and instabilities @xcite",
    ". first postulated more than ten years ago ( andersson 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ) , the r - mode instability has been attracting increased attention due to the fact that it is driven unstable by gw emission and it can be active for a wide range of core temperatures and angular velocities ( lindblom et al . 1998 ; andersson & kokkotas 2001 ; andersson et al .",
    "early estimate indicated an energy equivalent to roughly @xmath7 of a solar mass is radiated in gws ( andersson et al .",
    "1999 ) as an initially rapidly rotating star spins down .",
    "this led to an expectation of a sgwb produced by a cosmological population of young rapidly rotating nss with closure density @xmath8 peaking at @xmath9 of the present - day critical energy density of the universe @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect of the r - mode intability is the largest amplitude ( often called the saturation amplitude @xmath10 ) that the perturbation can grow to .",
    "this maximum amplitude determines how fast the ns spins down and whether the associated gw emission will be detectable ( either in terms of single event or a stochastic background ) . in owen",
    "et al . ( 1998 ) and then ferrari et al . ( 1999b ) it was taken to be of order unity ( there were no estimates of this maximum at that time ) .",
    "later more detailed ( both analytical and numerical ) studies seriously questioned the potential of the instability as well as the efficiency of gw emission ( rezzolla et al .",
    "2000 ; ho & lai 2000 ; lindblom et al .",

    "2001a , 2001b ; lindblom & owen 2002 ) . on the one hand",
    ", it was suggested that energy transfer to other stellar inertial modes can significantly reduce the saturation amplitude of r - mode @xcite .",
    "arras et al .",
    "( 2003 ) tested nonlinear coupling between stellar inertial modes and revealed much lower values of saturation amplitude ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "then a specific resonant three - mode coupling between the r - mode and the pair of fluid modes was identified to be responsible for the catastrophic decay of large - amplitude r - modes and a perturbative analysis of the decay rate suggested a maximum dimensionless saturation amplitude @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "more recently bondarescu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) examined the 3-mode coupling between the r - mode and two other inertial modes and showed that the r - mode evolution can progress in a number of different directions depending on unknown properties of the viscosity , leading to very complex consequent mode evolution and the associated gw signal .    on the other hand , differential rotation , first suggested by rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001a , 2001b ) , is an unavoidable feature of nonlinear r - modes ( stergioulas & font 2001 ; lindblom et al .",
    "2001 ; s 2004 ) . small values of @xmath10 mentioned above are also supported by studies on the role of differential rotation , causing large scale drift of fluid elements , in the nonlinear evolution of r - modes ( s & tom 2005 ) .",
    "in particular they parametrize the initial amount of differential rotation by @xmath13 and then relate the parameter @xmath13 to the largest amplitude that the r - mode can grow to . in this paper we will use the characteristic gw amplitude given by s & tom ( 2006 ) to account for the average source spectrum .",
    "the adopted gw amplitude , parametrized by parameter @xmath13 , in fact scales with the saturation amplitude @xmath10 . below we will discuss the influence of this quantity on the r - mode background .",
    "in addition to the average source spectra , the properties of agwb also depend on gw source formation rate .",
    "studies of cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) allow estimation of the birth rate of nss . in the last decade",
    "our knowledge of cosmic star formation has been greatly improved due to advances in astronomical observation and hydrodynamic simulation . here",
    "we take into account both observational and simulation - based csfr models to obtain the ns formation rate and discuss their effects on the resultant gw background .",
    "in particular , we will investigate the role of the maximal redshift of different csfr models in our results .",
    "the high - frequency window of gw spectrum ( @xmath14 a few khz ) is open today through pioneering efforts of the first - generation terrestrial ifos , such as laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) ( abramovici et al .",
    "1992 ) in livingston ( ligol ) and in hanford ( ligoh ) , virgo ( caron et al . 1997 ) near pisa , geo600 ( lck et al . 1997 ) in hanover and tama300 ( ando et al . 2001 ) at tokyo .",
    "although gws were not detected , an observational upper limit ( @xmath15 ) was placed on the energy density of sgwb at around 100  hz , exceeding previous indirect limits from the big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background @xcite . in the future",
    "the sgwb from ns r - mode instability , among others , may offer an important detection target for the proposed second and third generation detectors represented by advanced ligo ( or advanced virgo ) and the einstein telescope ( et ) respectively .",
    "detectors throughout the world can act as a network in order to improve the detection ability to the sgwb .",
    "two approaches of combining 2n ifos are proposed in allen & romano ( 1999 ) : ( i ) correlating the outputs of a pair of ifos , then combining the multiple pairs , and ( ii ) directly combining the outputs of 2n ifos . for any given real ifos",
    "it is necessary to compare these two optimal approaches of detecting the sgwb .",
    "cella et al . (",
    "2007 ) has shown that the approach of combining multiple pairs of ifos using virgo , ligo and geo can improve the detection ability to the sgwb by simulating an isotropic gw background with an astrophysically - motivated spectral shape .",
    "fan & zhu ( 2008 ) compared the detection ability of the two approaches for stochastic gws from string cosmology .",
    "detectability of the r - mode background are demonstrated here by calculating signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) for pairs of currently operating ifos and advanced detectors at their design sensitivities .",
    "we also consider two approaches of combining 4 real ifos to examine how many improvements can be obtained .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review works on the determination of csfr and present five csfr models . in section 3",
    "we derive the ns formation rate as a function of redshift using the adopted csfr models . then by combining the source formation rate from section 3 and the characteristic gw amplitude of individual events , spectral properties of the r - mode stochastic background",
    "are investigated in section 4 .",
    "we will discuss the detectability of r - mode background in section 5 and finally section 6 is devoted to our conclusions .    throughout the paper , the so - called 737 @xmath16cdm cosmology",
    "is assumed with @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( e.g. , komatsu et al .",
    "the csfr , which has tight connection with gw event rate , is of intense interest to many fields of astrophysics . for many years effort",
    "has gone into studying the cosmic star formation history ( see , e.g. , madau et al . 1996 ; hopkins 2004 ; wilkins et al . 2008 ) .",
    "since csfr is not a directly observable quantity , usually the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) light is considered to be an indicator ( see calzetti 2008 and references therein for details about csfr indicators ) of star formation because it is mainly radiated by short - lived massive stars . with the help of hubble space telescope ( hst ) and other large telescopes , galaxy luminosity density of rest - frame uv radiation",
    "is studied , and then converted into csfr density through the adoption of a universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) to calculate the conversion factor .",
    "many authors have developed parameterized fits to the expected evolution of the csfr with redshift .",
    "firstly , following porciani & madau ( 2001 ) , we adopt three different forms which model the csfr density for redshifts up to @xmath21 :    @xmath22    with i=1 , 2 , 3 denoting the different models , @xmath23 a constant , @xmath24 , @xmath25 a function of z and @xmath26^{1/2}/(1+z)^{3/2}$ ] . a constant factor of @xmath27 is applied to account for conversion of a salpeter imf with a lower cutoff from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( the one we will use below ) .",
    "@xmath30 convert the assumed cosmology from an einstein - de sitter universe to the @xmath16cdm cosmology ( porciani & madau 2001 ) .",
    "the first fit ( hereafter sfr1 ) is given by madau & pozzetti ( 2000 ) , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the csfr increases rapidly from @xmath33 to reach a peak at around @xmath34 and then gradually declines at higher redshifts .",
    "the second one ( sfr2 ) is from steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 where the csfr remains roughly constant at @xmath37 . the third model ( sfr3 ) from blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has @xmath38 and @xmath39 where csfr increases at higher redshifts to account for effects of dust extinction .    with the improvement in measurements of galaxy luminosity functions at a broad range of wavelengths ,",
    "star formation history can be traced to higher redshifts .",
    "here we consider the work by hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) , who refined the previous models up to redshift @xmath40 from new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function in the uv ( sdss , galex , combo17 ) and far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths ( spitzer space telescope ) . a parametric fit ( hereafter hb06 )",
    "is given by : @xmath41 assuming 737 cosmology and a modified salpeter a imf @xcite .",
    "although the imf used to derive hb06 is different from the standard salpeter s , this will not introduce considerable errors to our results because the evolution of ccsne rate based on the csfr and on an assumed universal imf is largely independent of the choice of the imf ( madau 1998 ) .",
    "many authors have addressed the issues of calibrating the high - z csfr through long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( see , e.g. , yksel et al .",
    "2008 and kistler et al .",
    "recently wang @xmath42 dai ( 2009 ) uses latest grbs data to constrain the csfr up to @xmath43 .",
    "meanwhile there are other methods to determine the high - z csfr , such as observations of color - selected lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( bouwens et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath44 emitters ( ota et al .",
    "however , such calibrations can not reach considerable agreements except for an overall decline at @xmath45 ( see figure 1 of yksel et al .",
    "2008 , kistler et al .",
    "2009 and wang & dai 2009 ) .",
    "due to huge uncertainties and the incompleteness of data sets we will not include them here .    on the other hand , springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) derive the csfr from hydrodynamic simulation of structure formation in @xmath16cdm cosmology .",
    "they study the history of cosmic star formation from the  dark ages \" , at redshift @xmath46 to the present .",
    "the csfr obtained in their study is broadly consistent with measurements given observational uncertainty and can be remarkably well - fitted by the following form ( hereafter sh03 ) : @xmath47}{\\beta - \\alpha + \\alpha \\cdot \\exp[\\beta(z - z_{m})]},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 marks a break redshift and @xmath51 @xmath52 fixes the overall normalization .",
    "it is worth mentioning that they consider a @xmath16cdm model with the same parameters with our assumed 737 cosmology .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the csfr predicted in the above five models as a function of redshift .",
    "sfr1 , sfr2 and sfr3 show distinguishable features at @xmath37 .",
    "sh03 peaks at a much higher redshift , between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , than observation - based models ( around @xmath55 ) .",
    "the cutoff of each curve in fig . 1 corresponds to maximum redshifts of csfr models : @xmath56 for sfr1 - 3 , @xmath57 for hb06 and @xmath58 for sh03 . what fig .",
    "1 illustrates is our poor understanding about star formation history at high redshifts from astronomical observations .",
    "note that there are some other csfr models , similar to or different from the five models adopt here , not included since our aim is not to make a complete survey on this issue but to phenomenologically investigate its influences on the sgwb from an ensemble of astrophysical sources .",

    "( 2007 ) for details of other studies on the determination of csfr . in the following sections we will investigate how different csfrs affect the rate of ns formation and spectral properties of agwb",
    "since the evolving rate of ccsne closely tracks the star formation rate , using csfr models presented in section 2 we can estimate the number of nss formed per unit time within the comoving volume out to redshift z ( ferrari et al .",

    "here we do not include such a term according to de araujo & miranda ( 2005 ) who argue that the inclusion of this additional term is inadequate .    to integrate through eq.([dr_ns ] ) one still needs to know the forms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we note that by considering new detectors with comparable sensitivities to advanced ligo , such as lcgt in japan ( kuroda et al .",
    "1999 ) and aigo in australia ( blair et al . 2008 ) , it could be possible to reach a higher , but still not significant snr with a network of second - generation ifos .    in order to obtain some detectable parameter space we need at least one order of magnitude higher snrs than those in case 2 of table 2 .",
    "then we reduce the noise power spectral densities of advanced ligo and advanced virgo by a factor of 10 by hand , and investigate the role of differential rotation ( @xmath13 ) and maximum emitting frequency ( @xmath92 ) in the detectability of the r - mode background .",
    "we are motivated here by the fact that third - generation detectors like et can reach a sensitivity roughly an order of magnitude better than that of advanced ligo ( hild et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot the snr as a function of @xmath13 for h - l , h - v and l - v pairs . as a natural result from fig . 5 ,",
    "the detectability of sgwb from r - mode instability is drastically reduced to 0 as @xmath13 approaching 10 .",
    "the higher snr of h - l pair reflects the lower noise level of advanced ligo . due to similarity of the overlap reduction functions",

    "no significant difference is shown between l - v and h - v pairs .",
    "8 shows the snr evolution with @xmath92 for h - l , h - v and l - v pairs .",
    "in contrast to fig . 5 , in which a higher peak value of @xmath0 was obtained for larger @xmath92 , there are no identical features for snr evolutions here . for h - l pair , we note that snr varies inversely as the increase of @xmath92 .",
    "this can be explained that the low - frequency gw background is enhanced for smaller @xmath92 while the growth of high - frequency background due to larger @xmath92 is suppressed by the @xmath93 term in eq .",

    "we discuss further the detection prospects of a sgwb from ns r - mode instability by networks of third generation instruments .",
    "10 indicates that only when the initial amount of differential rotation is near its minimum value ( @xmath102 ) , the r - mode background could be detectable by a real network of third - generation gw detectors .",
    "however , as emphasized by s & tom ( 2005 ) , if @xmath13 is near its minimum value , other nonlinear effects like mode - mode couplings should be included in the calculation of saturation amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "still in this case , @xmath10 will be limited to values much smaller than unity @xcite . in this respect",
    "the physically reasonable values of parameter @xmath13 introduced in s & tom ( 2005 ) should be larger than @xmath103 in order to be consistent with a maximum saturation amplitude @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "it seems most probable that the r - mode background is not going to be detectable .",
    "given the relation @xmath105 , a @xmath3 saturation amplitude ( compared with a value of order unity ) will reduce the snr by 4 orders of magnitude for any measurements of sgwb from ns r - mode instability . in particular , to reach the same snr requires 10000 times improvements in sensitivities of two detectors .",
    "if we leave the small @xmath10 issue ( the dominant aspect ) aside , it is still quite pessimistic to detect the r - mode background as seen from table 2 and fig .",
    "this is due to the following facts : 1 ) the closure density of this background peaks at much higher frequencies than the most sensitive frequency band of ground - based detectors ; 2 ) the minimum frequency of r - mode gw signal @xmath106 hz just misses the frequency band ( 1 - 60 hz ) where the overlap reduction functions of real detector pairs are significant ; 3 ) we should not forget that we assumed all nss are born with angular velocities near their maximal value @xmath107 .",
    "this is not necessarily always the case since it would make more sense to consider some fraction of nss are born with rapid spins ( owen et al .",
    "actually it has been suggested that most nss are born with very small rotation rates @xcite .",
    "current population synthesis studies favor spin periods of nss at birth in the range from tens to hundreds of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "realistic overlap reduction functions are adopted here for multiple ground - based ifos .",
    "recall that two co - located advanced ligo detectors ( @xmath96 , snr=11 ) perform even better than combining four ifos with 10-fold better sensitivities ( snr=5.8 ) . with this in mind",

    "combined with eq.([flux ] ) and eq.([amplitude ] ) we can obtain the spectral energy density and thus the total gw energy emitted by individual sources that contribute to this background .",

    "since the detectability is dominated by the square of saturation amplitude ( @xmath127 ) , it is likely that the r - mode background will not be detectable for any future detectors . still we give the constraints on the total emitted gw energy associated with this mechanism to enable a detection with @xmath128 detection rate ( @xmath129 ) by 3-year cross correlation as : @xmath130 for two co - located advanced ligo detectors and @xmath131 for two ifos with et sensitivity . considering the relatively certain ns formation rate , these constraints might be applicable to alternative emission mechanisms associated with ns oscillations and instabilities .",
    "this requires further investigation .",
    "the requirement on gw energy level could be lower if more signals are emitted near the most sensitive frequency band of ground - based detectors ( @xmath132 hz ) . through reasonable assumptions of average source spectra , the lowest detectable ( in terms of stochastic background )",
    "gw energy for individual source will be @xmath133 for third generation detectors like et @xcite .",
    "overall , for the detection of sgwb from ns instabilities , more efficient emitters are required ( see , e.g. , andersson et al .",
    "2010 for reviews of gw emission from nss and kastaun et al .",
    "2010 for details of a possible more efficient mechanism - f - mode ) .",
    "while the sgwb from ns r - mode instability is difficult to detect , the associated gw signal is still detectable in terms of single events @xcite , although this possibility also depends strongly on the saturation amplitude .",
    "for instance , initially it was believed that gws from r - mode instability in a newborn ns could be detected by advanced ligo out to a distance of 20 mpc @xcite .",
    "however even for the most optimistic case in bondarescu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the detectable distance for advanced ligo is only 1 mpc . the ligo scientific collaboration and virgo collaboration have already performed many searches for periodic gws from rapidly rotating nss including the first search targeting the youngest known ns - cassiopeia a @xcite . although no gws have been detected , direct upper limits on gw emission from known pulsars like the crab pulsar have beaten down the indirect spin - down limits @xcite .",

    "<S> we revisit the possibility and detectability of a stochastic gravitational wave ( gw ) background produced by a cosmological population of newborn neutron stars ( nss ) with r - mode instabilities . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the resultant gw background is insensitive to the choice of csfr models , but depends strongly on the evolving behavior of csfr at low redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear effects such as differential rotation , suggested to be an unavoidable feature which greatly influences the saturation amplitude of r - mode , are considered to account for gw emission from individual sources . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the dimensionless energy density @xmath0 could have a peak amplitude of @xmath1 in the frequency range @xmath2  hz , if the smallest amount of differential rotation corresponding to a saturation amplitude of order unity is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a high mode amplitude is unrealistic as it is known that the maximum value is much smaller and at most @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . a realistic estimate of @xmath0 should be at least 4 orders of magnitude lower ( @xmath4 ) , which leads to a pessimistic outlook for the detection of r - mode background . </S>",
    "<S> we consider different pairs of terrestrial interferometers ( ifos ) and compare two approaches to combine multiple ifos in order to evaluate the detectability of this gw background . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the total emitted gw energy associated with this mechanism to produce a detectable stochastic background ( a snr of 2.56 with 3-year cross correlation ) are @xmath5 for two co - located advanced ligo detectors , and @xmath6 for two einstein telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints may also be applicable to alternative gw emission mechanisms related to oscillations or instabilities in nss depending on the frequency band where most gws are emitted . </S>"
