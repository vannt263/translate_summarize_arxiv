    "are ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) powered by intense bursts of star formation or is an additional source of energy , such as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) required ? in order to address this question , it is instructive to compare the near - infrared spectra of uligs and lower luminosity starburst galaxies . in starburst galaxies of low or moderate luminosity , the dominant emission line is the @xmath6 line , underlining the importance of massive young stars in the energetics of these objects .",
    "the brightest @xmath1 rovibrational line , the @xmath1 @xmath7 s(1 ) line , is typically fainter  @xcite . in contrast , in uligs the @xmath1 @xmath7 s(1 ) line is significantly brighter than the @xmath6 line , which is often not even detected  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour shows that uligs are not just scaled - up starburst galaxies .",
    "an extreme case of is presented by @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.ngc6240spec ] ) , where the @xmath1 @xmath7 s(1 ) line is 40 times brighter than @xmath6 . the low ratio of @xmath6 luminosity to fir luminosity in uligs has been used to argue against star formation as the power source of uligs , for instance in the nearby ulig @xmath8 , where a starburst with the low @xmath6 luminosity observed can account for at most 10% of the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy  @xcite . however , spectroscopy of uligs at longer wavelengths with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) revealed bright emission lines from powerful starbursts , which are the dominant power source in most of the objects studied , but are obscured at shorter wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , in this paper the physical processes revealed by the @xmath4-band spectra of uligs are reexamined in the context of the starburst scenario . in sect .",
    "[ sec.ngc6240 ] the origin of the @xmath1 line emission is discussed , while sect .",
    "[ sec.arp220 ] addresses the faintness of @xmath6 .     in the @xmath1",
    "@xmath7 s(1 ) line and the @xmath9 continuum with nicmos / hst  @xcite ]",
    "the most extreme vibrational @xmath1 emission is found in the nearby luminous merger @xmath0 : @xmath11 is emitted in the @xmath1 @xmath7 s(1 ) line alone ( for @xmath12 and with no correction for extinction ) .",
    "this line contains 0.012% of the bolometric luminosity of @xmath0 , which is considerably higher than any other galaxy @xcite .",
    "together the vibrational lines may account for 0.1% of the total bolometric luminosity .",
    "imaging of the @xmath1 @xmath7 s(1 ) emission from @xmath0 has shown that the @xmath1 emission peaks _ between _ the two remnant nuclei of the merging system @xcite .",
    "this morphology provides a unique constraint on the excititation mechanism , since it argues against any scenario where the excitation is dominated by the stellar component ( e.g. , uv - pumping , excitation by shocks or x - rays from supernova remnants ) . instead",
    ", the favoured excitation mechanism is slow shocks in the nuclear gas component , which , as shown by high resolution interferometry in the co @xmath13 line @xcite , also peaks between the nuclei of @xmath0 .",
    "what is the role of these shocks ? in the shocks mechanical energy is dissipated and radiated away , mostly in spectral lines ( principally @xmath1 , co , @xmath14 and [ @xmath15 lines ) .",
    "this energy is radiated away at the expense of the orbital energy of the molecular clouds in the central potential well .",
    "consequently , the dissipation of mechanical energy by the shocks will give rise to an infall of molecular gas to the centre of the potential well . therefore , _ the @xmath1",
    "vibrational lines measure the rate of infall of molecular gas _ into the central potential well .",
    "this conclusion can be quantified by writing @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total luminosity radiated by the shocks and @xmath18 the dissipation rate of mechanical energy , giving rise to a molecular gas infall rate @xmath19 given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the circular orbital velocity at the position where the shock occurs .",
    "using a @xmath4-band extinction of @xmath22 @xcite , the total luminosity of @xmath1 vibrational lines from @xmath0 becomes @xmath23 ; inclusion of the purely rotational lines observed with iso approximately doubles this number , so that @xmath24 .    in order to use this number to estimate @xmath19 , it is necessary to establish more accurately the fraction of the @xmath1 emission that is due to infalling gas .",
    "observations with nicmos on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) provide the required information ( fig .  [ fig.ngc6240nicmos ] )  @xcite .",
    "the nicmos image shows that the emission consists of a number of tails ( presumably related to the superwind also observed in @xmath25 emission ) , and concentrations assocated with the two nuclei , and a further concentration approximately ( but not precisely ) between the two nuclei .",
    "the relative brightness of the @xmath1 emission from the southern nucleus is deceptive , since this nucleus is much better centred in the filter that was used for these observations than the other emission components , in particular the northern nucleus . taking this effect into account",
    ", it is found that 32% of the total @xmath1 flux is associated with the southern nucleus , 16% is associated with the northern nucleus , and 12% with the component between the two nuclei , the remaining 40% being associated with extended emission . using inclination - corrected circular velocities of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the southern and northern nucleus respectively  @xcite , and of @xmath28 for the central component @xcite , the mass infall rates derived using @xmath29@xmath30 are @xmath31 for the southern nucleus , @xmath32 for the northern nucleus and @xmath33 for the central component .",
    "the derived molecular gas inflow rate to the two nuclei is remarkably close to the mass consumption rate by star formation of approximately @xmath34 , indicating that the @xmath1 emission from the nuclei directly measures the fueling of the starbursts in these regions .",
    "this analysis shows that the central regions of @xmath0 are being fueled at a rate sufficient to maintain starburst activity at the level required to account for the fir luminosity .",
    "accepting the starburst model , the faintness of @xmath6 and other recombination lines remains to be addressed . as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ sec.intro ] , it is evident that selective extinction towards the regions of most recent massive star formation plays a significant role in suppressing the @xmath6 emission .",
    "can this effect be quantified ?",
    "the nearby ulig @xmath2 has been studied in detail with the iso satelite .",
    "based on an upper limit on the ratio of the [ @xmath35 18 and @xmath36 lines , and a high @xmath37 over @xmath6 flux ratio , an extinction @xmath38 , located purely in an absorbing foreground screen was proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , the supporting arguments have now weakened significantly . in the first place ,",
    "a better understanding of the calibration of the [ @xmath35 @xmath36 spectrum has made the upper limit on the [ @xmath35 18 to @xmath36 flux ratio less strict by approximately a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the @xmath37 flux from iso  @xcite is almost certainly an overestimate : the @xmath37 line displays , on top of a higly structured baseline , a double - peaked structure , which is absent in any other line ( including long - wavelength lines such as the well - detected [ @xmath35 @xmath36 line ) .",
    "the velocity difference between the two peaks in @xmath37 is approximately @xmath39 and therefore can not be attributed to motion of the two nuclei of @xmath2 , which have a radial velocity difference of approximately @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the same velocity difference of @xmath40 is found in long - slit @xmath6 spectra of the @xmath2 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "an integrated high - resolution @xmath6 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig.arp220brg ] ) shows no trace of a double - peaked structure , indicating that the high @xmath37 flux found with iso is most likely dominated by structure in the spectral baseline .",
    "the extinction derived from the @xmath37/@xmath6 ratio should thus be used as an upper limit . a further argument against an obscuring foreground screen with @xmath41 is furnished by the derived lyman continuum fluxes , which increase as as shorter wavelength tracers are used  @xcite , a behaviour suggesting that the extinction has been overestimated . finally ,",
    "a strong limit on the presence of an intense , highly obscured , but otherwise normal starburst follows from the upper limit to the free - free emission at millimetre wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that either a foreground screen with a lower visual extinction , or a model with mixed emission and absorption needs to be adopted .",
    "this result does however _ not _ imply the presence of a strongly aged starburst , or an additional source of power in @xmath2 , since the preceding analysis ignored the role of lyman continuum absorption by dust within the ionized regions . if most of the ionizing radiation is absorbed by dust grains rather than hydrogen atoms , a dust - bounded ( rather than hydrogen - bounded ) nebula results , and all tracers of ionized gas ( recombination lines , fine - structure lines , free - free emission ) will be suppressed .",
    "if the @xmath42 regions in @xmath2 are principally dust - bounded , the observational properties of @xmath2 can be accounted for , even with only moderate extinction . since the dust would also absorb far - ultraviolet radiation longwards of the lyman limit , the formation of photon - dominated regions would also be suppressed , and the thus the same mechanism can account for the faintness of the @xmath43 [ @xmath44 line in @xmath2 and other uligs  @xcite .    is the @xmath2 starburst dominated by dust - bounded @xmath42 regions ? the _ average _ molecular gas density in the @xmath45 nuclear molecular complex in @xmath2 is @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the strong emission from high dipole moment molecules such as cs , hco@xmath47 and hcn argues for even higher densities : @xmath45 of molecular gas ( i.e. , _ all _ of the gas in the nuclear complex ) has a density @xmath48  @xcite . at such densities",
    "the ionized nebulae created by hot stars are _ compact _ or _ ultracompact _",
    "@xmath42 regions , where 50 to 99% of the lyman continuum is absorbed by dust  @xcite .",
    "observationally , hydrogen - bounded and dust - bounded @xmath42 regions can be distinguished by the quantity @xmath49/@xmath50 : for a wide range of parameters , @xmath51 implies that the nebula is hydrogen - bounded , while @xmath52 implies that the nebula is dust - bounded  @xcite . for @xmath2 , the @xmath6 luminosity of @xmath53 ( from the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig.arp220brg ] , with a distance of @xmath54 ) implies @xmath55 assuming an obscuring foreground screen with @xmath56 ( a model consistent with the results discussed above ) .",
    "even with a foreground extinction of @xmath57 ( which is most likely an overestimate , as discussed above ) , a ratio @xmath58 would result , so that even in that case the absorption of lyman continuum radiation by dust would play a significant role .",
    "the star formation takes place in ( ultra)compact @xmath42 regions , where all of the usual tracers of ionized gas ( recombination lines , fine - structure lines , free - free emission ) are _ quenched _ , not extincted .",
    "while this result significantly complicates the interpretation of diagnostics of massive star formation in uligs , it is save to conclude that the properties of @xmath2 can be accounted for by an intense , and significantly ( but not extremely ) obscured starburst .",
    "there is no reason to invoke the presence of extreme extinction , a strongly aged starburst , or an additional power source in @xmath2 .",
