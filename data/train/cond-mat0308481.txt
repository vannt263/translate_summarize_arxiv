    "the effective field theory ( eft ) approach provides a powerful framework that exploits the separation of scales in physical systems .",
    "only low - energy ( or long - range ) degrees of freedom are included explicitly , with the rest parametrized in terms of the most general local ( contact ) interactions .",
    "this procedure exploits the fact that a low - energy probe of momentum @xmath0 can not resolve structures on scales smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "( note that @xmath2 in this talk . ) using renormalization , the influence of short - distance physics on low - energy observables is captured in a small number of low - energy constants .",
    "thus , the eft describes universal low - energy physics independent of detailed assumptions about the short - distance dynamics .",
    "all physical observables can be described in a controlled expansion in powers of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the characteristic low - energy length scale of the system .",
    "the size of @xmath4 depends on the system under consideration : for a finite range potential , e.g. , it is given by the range of the potential .",
    "for the systems discussed here , @xmath4 is of the order of the effective range @xmath5 .    in this talk",
    ", i will focus on applications of eft to few - body systems with large s - wave scattering length @xmath6 . for a generic system ,",
    "the scattering length is of the same order of magnitude as the low - energy length scale @xmath4 . only a very specific choice of the parameters in the underlying theory ( a so - called _ fine tuning _ ) will generate a large scattering length .",
    "systems with large scattering length can be found in many areas of physics .",
    "examples are the s - wave scattering of nucleons and of @xmath7he atoms . for alkali atoms close to a feshbach resonance , @xmath8 can be tuned experimentally by adjusting an external magnetic field .",
    "in this section , we give a very brief review of the eft for few - body systems with large scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "we will focus on s - waves ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for typical momenta @xmath9 ,",
    "the eft expansion is in powers of @xmath10 so that higher order corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the leading order corresponds to @xmath11 .",
    "we consider a 2-body system of nonrelativistic bosonic atoms with large scattering length @xmath8 and mass @xmath12 . at sufficiently low energies , the most general lagrangian for s - wave interactions",
    "may be written as : @xmath13 where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are nonderivative 2- and 3-body interaction terms , respectively .",
    "the strength of the @xmath14 term is determined by the scattering length @xmath8 , while @xmath15 depends on a 3-body parameter to be introduced below .",
    "the dots represent higher - order derivative terms which are suppressed at low - energies . for momenta @xmath0 of the order of the inverse scattering length @xmath16 , the problem is nonperturbative in @xmath17 .",
    "the exact 2-body scattering amplitude can be obtained analytically by summing the so - called _ bubble diagrams _ with the @xmath14 interaction term .",
    "the @xmath15 term does not contribute to 2-body observables .",
    "after renormalization , the resulting amplitude reproduces the leading order of the well - known effective range expansion for the atom - atom scattering amplitude :  @xmath18 where the total energy is @xmath19 . if @xmath20 , @xmath21 has a pole at @xmath22 corresponding to a shallow dimer with binding energy @xmath23 .",
    "higher - order derivative interactions are perturbative and give the momentum - dependent terms in the effective range expansion .",
    "we now turn to the 3-body system . here , it is useful to introduce an auxiliary field for the two - atom state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . at leading order ,",
    "the atom - dimer scattering amplitude is given by the integral equation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineq ] .",
    "a solid line indicates a single atom and a double line indicates an interacting two - atom state ( including rescattering corrections ) .",
    "the integral equation contains contributions from both the 2-body and the 3-body force terms .",
    "the inhomogeneous term is given by the first two diagrams on the right - hand side : the one - atom exchange diagram and the 3-body force .",
    "the integral equation simply sums these diagrams to all orders . after projecting onto s - waves ,",
    "we obtain the equation @xmath24 for the off - shell atom - dimer scattering amplitude with the inhomogeneous term @xmath25 the logarithmic term is the s - wave projected one - atom exchange , while the term proportional to @xmath26 comes from the 3-body force . the physical atom - dimer scattering amplitude @xmath27 is given by the solution @xmath28 evaluated at the on - shell point :  @xmath29 where @xmath30 . the 3-body binding energies @xmath31 are given by those values of @xmath32 for which the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a nontrivial solution .",
    "note that an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath33 has been introduced in ( [ eq : bhvk ] ) .",
    "this cutoff is required to insure that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "all physical observables , however , must be invariant under changes of the cutoff , which determines the behavior of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath35 \\over \\cos [ s_0 \\ln ( \\lambda/ \\lambda _ * ) - \\arctan s_0]}\\ , , \\label{h - lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a transcendental number and @xmath37 is a 3-body parameter introduced by dimensional transmutation .",
    "this parameter can not be predicted by the eft and must be taken from experiment .",
    "note that @xmath38 is periodic and runs on a limit cycle .",
    "when @xmath33 is increased by a factor of @xmath39 , @xmath38 returns to its original value .    in summary ,",
    "two parameters are required in the 3-body system at leading order in @xmath10 : the scattering length @xmath8 ( or the dimer binding energy @xmath40 ) and the 3-body parameter @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the eft reproduces the universal aspects of the 3-body system that were first derived by efimov @xcite .",
    "these include the accumulation of infinitely many 3-body bound states ( so - called _ efimov states _ ) at threshold as @xmath41 .",
    "as we will demonstrate in the next section , eft is a very efficient calculational tool to calculate those properties .",
    "in this section , we discuss some applications of the eft to systems of cold atoms and bec s .",
    "first we turn to the 3-body system of @xmath7he atoms , where @xmath42 .",
    "both the @xmath7he dimer and trimer were observed .",
    "the complete 3-body bound state spectrum in leading order in the eft follows from solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) .",
    "it can also be parametrized in terms of a universal function @xmath43 of the angle @xmath44 and a 3-body parameter @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath45 was recently calculated in eft @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no 3-body observables have been measured for @xmath7he atoms up to now , so that @xmath37 can not be determined from experiment .",
    "however , extensive bound state calculations with modern potentials exist .",
    "we have used recent calculations by motovilov et al .",
    "@xcite , to obtain the dimer binding energy and the 3-body parameter @xmath37 from the calculated binding energy of the trimer excited state @xmath46 .",
    "we have then used this input to calculate the trimer ground state energy @xmath47 for four different @xmath7he potentials @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab:4he ] .",
    ".universality for @xmath7he atoms .",
    "the first three columns show the calculated binding energies of the dimer and the trimer ground and excited states for four modern @xmath7he potentials @xcite .",
    "the last two columns show the extracted value of @xmath48 and the leading order eft prediction for the trimer ground state @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the predicted ground state binding energy @xmath47 agrees well with the direct calculation of motovilov et al .  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that both the excited and ground state of the @xmath7he trimer are efimov states .",
    "universality also constrains 3-body scattering observables .",
    "for example the atom - dimer scattering length can be expressed in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath37 as @xcite @xmath49)\\ , ( 1\\,+\\,{\\cal o}(r_e / a))\\,,\\qquad\\qquad a>0\\,.\\ ] ] where the numerical constants were calculated in eft . using the value of @xmath37 extracted from the excited state binding energy , a good agreement with @xmath50 from the direct calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is obtained @xcite .",
    "universality is also manifest in universal scaling functions . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_k3 ] , we display the scaling function relating @xmath51 to @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the data points give various calculations using modern @xmath7he potentials while the solid line gives the universality prediction from eft .",
    "different points on this line correspond to different values of @xmath37 .",
    "the small deviations of the potential calculations from the universal curve are mainly due to effective range corrections and can be calculated at next - to - leading order in eft .",

    "the event rate can be parametrized as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the density of the atoms and @xmath57 is the recombination constant . at threshold ,",

    "the renormalization of the eft for 3-body systems with large scattering length requires a 3-body force at leading order @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of the 3-body force is governed by a limit cycle . via dimensional transmutation",
    ", the 3-body force introduces a dimensionful parameter , @xmath37 , that parametrizes universal relations between different 3-body observables .",
    "the eft is very general and can be applied to many physical systems ranging from the 3-body system of @xmath7he atoms @xcite , to 3-body recombination and dimer deactivation in cold atomic gases / bec s @xcite , to the triton and hypertriton in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "future challenges include the extension of the eft to the four - body system , the stability and phase structure of cold atomic gases / bec s close to a feshbach resonance @xcite , and the possibility of coexisting condensates of atoms , dimers , and trimers @xcite .",
