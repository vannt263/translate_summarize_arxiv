    "it was shown that the _ box dimension _ of either a spiral trajectory in the plane or of a discrete orbit of the poincar ' e map on the real line uniquely reveals the cyclicity of a limit cycle or a weak focus ( in generic unfoldings ) .",
    "box dimension of a trajectory is closely related to the asymptotic behavior of the lebesgue measure of the @xmath0-neighborhood of the trajectory , as @xmath1 , see section  [ onetwo ] below for the precise definition . only one ( any )",
    "spiral trajectory is needed .    in @xcite ,",
    "box dimension of spiral trajectories around _",
    "weak foci _ and _ limit cycles _ was computed .",
    "the box dimension was computed applying either _ the flow - box theorem _ @xcite or _ the flow - sector theorem _",
    "@xcite , which state a locally parallel structure of the trajectory at a transversal to the set .",
    "box dimension is computed as cartesian product dimension , using the results about the box dimension of the one - dimensional orbit of the poincar ' e map given in @xcite .",
    "the box dimension of a spiral trajectory is thus brought in a bijective correspondence with cyclicity in generic bifurcations .",
    "our study here is concerned with relating geometric , fractal properties of one trajectory around the loop with the cyclicity of the loop . in this paper , we compute the box dimension of a spiral trajectory around simplest hyperbolic saddle polycycles , hyperbolic loops , and compare it with cyclicity results .",
    "the descripton of bifurcations and the cyclicity of homoclinic sets , including hyperbolic saddle loops , is of interest in many applications , see the book of palis , takens @xcite . in @xcite or @xcite ,",
    "the poincar ' e maps of hyperbolic saddle polycycles are described as having an expansion in a chebyshev power - log scale .",
    "the cyclicity was related to the first non - zero coefficient in the expansion called the _ loop quantity _ , which is the analogon of lyapunov coefficient for focus points .    in cases of limit cycles and foci",
    ", the poincar ' e map has the same asymptotics on every transversal to the set .",
    "here we show that the poincar ' e map at any transversal through the saddle vertex has a different asymptotics than poincar ' e maps at other transversals to the loop .",
    "therefore , to compute box dimension of the spiral trajectory , we develop a new version of the flow - box theorem that _ identifies _ the trajectory around a saddle point with an appropriate _ set of hyperbolas_.    furthermore , the poincar ' e map of limit cycles and foci is differentiable at zero .",
    "that is , their asymptotic expansion is a formal taylor series .",
    "the poincar ' e maps of saddle polycycles expand in nondifferentiable real power - log chebyshev scales , see @xcite , or @xcite for chebyshev scales .",
    "we show here that , unlike in differentiable cases from @xcite , in nondifferentiable saddle - loop cases the box dimension is not sufficient for recognizing cyclicity . by its definition ,",
    "the box dimension compares the area of the @xmath0-neighborhood to a power scale .",
    "it is implicitely shown in this paper that , in nondifferentiable cases , the areas of the @xmath0-neighborhoods of trajectories are not of power - type behavior . to get precise information ,",
    "we need beforehand a finer logarithmic scale , depending on the bifurcation .",
    "the box dimension of a whole trajectory thus reflects the same deficiency as the box dimension of one - dimensional orbits of the poincar ' e map treated in @xcite : it can not recognize between two neighboring cyclicities .",
    "we expect future applications of the result to be twofold .",
    "first , a similar technique can be adapted to computing the box dimension of spiral trajectories around _ degenerate and nilpotent foci_. as in the saddle loop case , the asymptotics of the poincar ' e map is dependent on the choice of the transversal .",
    "that is , there exist at least two distinct asymptotics .",
    "secondly , planar fractal analysis obviously distinguishes betweenstrong and weak foci , see @xcite , @xcite , but fails in distinguishing between hyperbolic saddle points .",
    "namely , such points are not monodromic , trajectories are not recurring and the poincar ' e map is not well - defined .",
    "resonant complex saddles are complexifications of weak foci points , as well as of hyperbolic saddles .",
    "they are monodromic .",
    "their monodromy maps are called _ holonomy maps _ , see e.g. @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the holonomy maps are complex parabolic germs defined on two - dimensional transversals .",
    "the box dimension of such germs was computed in @xcite . by @xcite ,",
    "the structure is again locally parallel , except at the saddle vertex .",
    "computing the box dimension of planar hyperbolic saddle loops is hopefully a preliminary technique for computing the box dimension of a leaf of a foliation around a complex saddle point .",
