    ", one can show that this graph underlies a nonzero tensegrity if and only if at least one of the following codimension  1 conditions holds : @xmath395    so the first four graphs with 11 edges have zero @xmath172-tc .",
    "the other three have 12 edges .",
    "we apply corollary  [ corollary 1.12.new ] to @xmath386 and @xmath396 to obtain that @xmath397 to prove that the @xmath172-tc of @xmath398 is 1 we proceed as follows .",
    "first , @xmath399 by corollary  [ corollary 1.7 . ]",
    ". then we apply proposition  [ proposition 1.9 . ]",
    "as shown in figure  [ 8 ] .",
    "the graph @xmath0 has 6 vertices and 10 edges and thus we have @xmath369 .",
    "it is easy to check that for a general position framework @xmath10 with a nonzero self - stress , all edges of @xmath10 have nonzero stress . on the middle picture",
    "we get a vertex of degree 2 , so we reduce to the graph @xmath178 on the right . note that @xmath178 is isomorphic to @xmath0 , so @xmath400 .",
    "hence @xmath401 as well .      [",
    "[ smallvert2 ] ] geometric conditions for realizability of plane tensegrities for graphs with zero tensegrity @xmath172-characteristic ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    like in intersection theory of algebraic varieties , it often happens that strata for a graph with negative @xmath172-tc are obtained as intersections of closures of some strata of graphs with zero @xmath172-tc .",
    "so the conditions for realizability of plane tensegrities for graphs with zero @xmath172-tc are the most important . in this subsection",
    "we give all the conditions for the zero @xmath172-tc graphs with number of vertices not exceeding 8 .    in practice",
    "one would like to construct a tensegrity without struts or cables with zero tension .",
    "so it is natural to give the following definition .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath0 is _ visible _ at the framework @xmath36 if there exists a self - stress that is nonzero at each edge of this framework .",
    "visibility restrictions remove many degenerate strata . for instance if a zero @xmath172-tc graph @xmath0 has a complete subgraph on vertices @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 , then the codimension 1 stratum defined by the condition : _ the points @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 are on one line _ does in many cases not contain visible frameworks .",
    "let us list the geometric conditions for the vertices of all visible 2-vertex and 3-edge connected graphs with @xmath1 vertices and zero @xmath172-tc for @xmath403 . to find the geometric conditions we essentially use the surgeries of section  4 , see propositions  [ proposition 1.9 .",
    "] , [ operation1 ] and  [ operation2 ] .",
    " for six points @xmath346 the lines @xmath349 , @xmath350 , and @xmath351 have a common nonempty intersection . + as we have seen in examples  [ 6pconic ] and  [ 2_2_2 ] these conditions are equivalent to geometric conditional systems .",
    "for the last three graphs in the table we have two distinct equations . nevertheless , the @xmath172-tc of the graphs are zero .",
    "this is similar to the case of non - complete intersections in algebraic geometry .",
