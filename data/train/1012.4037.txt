    "the alice experiment  @xcite will study nucleus ",
    "nucleus and proton  proton collisions at the large hadron collider , with the main goal of investigating the properties of the high - density state of qcd matter that is expected to be formed in pb  pb collisions  @xcite . the detector was designed in order to provide tracking and particle identification , for all particle species , over a large range of momenta ( from tens of mev/@xmath1 to over 100  gev/@xmath1 ) , low material budget and excellent vertexing capabilities .",
    "these features have been tailored to reach a detailed characterization of the state of matter produced in pb ",
    "pb collisions , with particular attention to global event properties and hard probes .",
    "however , they also provide unique capabilities for carrying out a program of qcd measurements in pp collisions .",
    "this report is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : alice ] , the alice experimental setup is described , with emphasis on the detectors that were used for the results presented here , along with the data collection and event classification .",
    "the two most fundamental measurements that characterize inclusive particle production are reported in sections  [ sec : mult ] and [ sec : pt ] : the charged particle multiplicity density and multiplicity distribution at @xmath2 , 2.36 and 7  tev  @xcite , and the charged particle transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) distribution and mean transverse momentum as a function of event multiplicity at 0.9  tev  @xcite . in section  [ sec : pbarp ] the measurement of the midrapidity antiproton over proton ratio , which allows to address the mechanisms that transfer the baryon number from beam to central rapidity , at 0.9 and 7  tev is described  @xcite . in section  [ sec : femto ] the measurement of the bose - einstein two - pion correlation , that allows to characterize the spatial extension of the particle emitting source , is described  @xcite . finally , in section  [ sec : strangecharm ] , an outlook is given on the ongoing analyses on strangeness  @xcite and heavy - flavour production .",
    "the alice apparatus is described in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two main parts : a central detector , placed inside a solenoidal magnet providing a field of up to 0.5  t , where charged and neutral particles are reconstructed and identified in the pseudorapidity range @xmath4 , and a forward muon spectrometer covering the range @xmath5 . the apparatus is completed by a set of smaller detectors in the forward areas , for triggering , charged particle and photon counting , and event classification .",
    "the main results presented in this report ( sections  [ sec : mult][sec : femto ] ) were obtained using the following alice detectors : the vzero scintillators , the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the two forward scintillator hodoscopes ( vzero ) are segmented into 32 scintillator counters each , arranged in four rings around the beam pipe .",
    "they cover the pseudorapidity ranges @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the its  @xcite is composed of high resolution silicon tracking detectors , arranged in six cylindrical layers at radial distances to the beam line from 3.9 to 43 cm .",
    "three different technologies are employed : silicon pixel detectors ( spd ) for the two innermost layers , silicon drift detector ( sdd ) for the two intermediate layers , and silicon strip detector ( ssd ) for the two outermost layers .",
    "the design spatial resolutions of the its sub - detectors ( @xmath8 ) are : @xmath9 for spd , @xmath10 for sdd , and @xmath11 for ssd .",
    "the spd and ssd detectors were aligned using survey measurements , cosmic muon data  @xcite and collision data to an estimated accuracy of @xmath12 for the spd and @xmath13 for the ssd  @xcite .",
    "no alignment corrections are applied to the positions of the sdd modules , for which calibration and alignment are in progress .",
    "the estimated misalignment of the sdd modules is about @xmath14 .",
    "the tpc  @xcite is a large cylindrical drift detector with cathode pad readout multi - wire proportional chambers at the two edges .",
    "the active volume is @xmath15  cm and @xmath16  cm in the radial and longitudinal directions respectively . at the present level of calibration ,",
    "the transverse momentum resolution achieved in the tpc is given by @xmath17 , with @xmath3 in gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the transverse momentum resolution for @xmath18 is measured in cosmic muon events by comparing the muon momenta reconstructed in the upper and lower halves of the tpc  @xcite . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the monte carlo estimate of @xmath20 was cross - checked using the measured @xmath21 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath22 resolution is estimated to be about @xmath23 for full - length tracks  @xcite .",
    "all data presented in this report were collected with a magnetic field of 0.5  t. the analyses with pp collisions at @xmath2 and @xmath24 are based on data collected in november and december 2009 , while the analyses at @xmath25 are based on data collected in april and may 2010 .",
    "the data at 0.9 tev and 7 tev were collected with a trigger requiring a hit in the spd or in either of the vzero counters ; i.e. essentially at least one charged particle anywhere in the 8 units of pseudorapidity . at 2.36 tev ,",
    "the vzero detector was turned off ; the trigger required at least one hit in the spd ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the events were selected in coincidence with signals from two beam pick - up counters ( bptx ) , one on each side of the interaction region , indicating the passage of proton bunches .",
    "control triggers taken ( with the exception of the 2.36 tev data ) for various combinations of beam and empty - beam buckets were used to measure beam - induced and accidental backgrounds .",
    "most backgrounds were removed as described in  @xcite .",
    "the remaining background in the sample is typically of the order of @xmath27 to @xmath28 and can be neglected .",
    "the total inelastic pp cross section is commonly subdivided into contributions from diffractive and non - diffractive processes . at 0.9  tev",
    ", we perform our analyses for two classes of events : inelastic ( inel ) and non - single - diffractive ( nsd ) pp collisions .",
    "the inel sample is selected using the minimum - bias trigger condition described above ( signal in spd or in either of the vzero counters ) . for the nsd analyses , a subset of this sample is selected offline by requiring a coincidence between the two vzero detectors . this condition suppresses a significant fraction of the single - diffractive ( sd ) events .",
    "the fractions of the different process types contributing to the selected event samples are estimated by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the process fractions of single - diffractive and double - diffractive ( dd ) events in the event generators are scaled to match the cross section in @xmath29 at @xmath30 measured by the ua5 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the selection efficiency for inel and nsd events is approximately 96% and 93% , respectively .",
    "since the 2.36  tev data sample was triggered by at least one hit in the spd , this selection was used for both inel and nsd analyses . at 7 tev",
    ", there is no experimental information available about diffractive processes ; therefore , we chose an event class requiring at least one charged particle in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , minimizing the model dependence of the corrections .",
    "for the comparison of the multiplicity measurements at all lhc energies , we analyzed the data at 0.9 tev and 2.36 tev also in this event class .",
    "alice has measured the charged particle multiplicity density @xmath36 and the multiplicity distribution @xmath37 at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 in @xmath38 ( @xmath39 at @xmath35 )  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on using hits in the two spd layers to form short track segments , called tracklets .",
    "a tracklet is defined by a hit combination , one hit in the inner and one in the outer spd layer , pointing to the reconstructed vertex .",
    "the tracklet algorithm is described in  @xcite . for this analysis , the position of the interaction vertex",
    "is reconstructed by correlating hits in the two silicon - pixel layers  @xcite .",
    "the vertex resolution achieved depends on the particle multiplicity , and is typically @xmath40@xmath41 in the longitudinal ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43@xmath44 in the transverse direction .",
    "primary charged particles are defined as the particles produced in the collision , excluding the weak decays of strange hadrons .",
    "their multiplicity is estimated by counting the number of spd tracklets , corrected for : geometrical acceptance , detector and reconstruction efficiencies ; contamination from weak - decay products of strange particles , gamma conversions , and secondary interactions ; undetected particles below the 50  mev/@xmath1 transverse - momentum cut - off , imposed by absorption in the material ; combinatorial background in tracklet reconstruction .",
    "two different event generators , pythia  @xcite ( tune perugia-0  @xcite ) and phojet  @xcite , were used to evaluate the corrections , using the pythia results as central value and the phojet results to define an asymmetric systematic error .",
    "other systematic uncertainties were estimated as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the main error sources that were considered are : detector material description , spd residual misalignment , particle composition in the generators , fraction of particle below the low - momentum cut - off , relative fraction of non - diffractive , single - diffractive and double - diffractive events .",
