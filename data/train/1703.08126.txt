    "in entanglement studies @xcite , one divides a system into two parts and asks how these are coupled in the quantum state under consideration . this information",
    "is contained in the reduced density matrix for one of the subsystems which can be written in the form @xmath1 with an operator @xmath2 now commonly called the entanglement hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "its eigenvalue spectrum determines the degree of the entanglement and thus is of primary importance .",
    "however , also its structure is interesting since it shows universal features which depend on the way in which the system is divided .    for non - critical integrable chains divided into two halves ,",
    "the relation of @xmath3 to corner transfer matrices leads to an operator @xmath2 with terms which increase linearly away from the boundary between the subsystems , see @xcite .",
    "this holds for spin chains @xcite as well as for coupled oscillators @xcite and is also found in the continuum @xcite .",
    "for critical quantum chains , conformal field theory gives results also for other cases , as discussed most recently by cardy and tonni @xcite .",
    "thus , for a subsystem of length @xmath4 in an infinite chain , one finds @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy density in the physical hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the parabolic weight factor becomes linear near the ends and can be viewed as the combined effect of the two boundaries .    on the lattice",
    ", such a form was found in numerical studies of a fermionic hopping model equivalent to an xx chain @xcite and in an xxz chain for the value @xmath7 , when the ground state is particularly simple @xcite .",
    "however , the nearest - neighbour terms in @xmath2 were not exactly parabolic and there were couplings to more distant neighbours , albeit of smaller magnitude . due to the small subsystems ,",
    "no clear answer could be given for the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "in this paper , we look once more at the free - fermion model and settle the problem for this system .",
    "starting from the insight obtained by numerical calculations , we develop an analytical treatment in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "it is based on a paper by slepian who studied the matrix problem underlying the determination of @xmath2 already in the seventies in the context of time- and band - limited signals @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to express @xmath2 in terms of a closely related tridiagonal matrix @xmath8 and powers of it . for a half - filled system",
    ", this leads to explicit formulae for all the hopping matrix elements in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions . for other fillings ,",
    "the coefficients in the resulting series are more complicated and the summations have to be done numerically . in this way we confirm that the deviations mentioned above do persist in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "in particular , the hopping to more distant neighbours for half filling shows a parabolic law raised to the power @xmath9 near the boundaries , where @xmath9 is the range . in the bulk",
    ", there is an additional enhancement and the maximal amplitude decreases with @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "the analytical expressions are checked against numerical results obtained directly for large subsystem sizes .",
    "this requires extreme accuracy in the diagonalization of the correlation matrix from which @xmath2 follows ( roughly @xmath0 digits for @xmath0 sites ) and such calculations have been done so far only in one very recent study where the continuum version of the present problem was addressed @xcite .    in the following section 2",
    "we formulate the problem and give the basic expressions .",
    "then , in section 3 , we present numerical results for the single - particle spectrum and the matrix elements of @xmath2 for half filling . in section 4",
    "we recall some asymptotic results of slepian and present the application to our problem with the resulting formulae for a half - filled system . in section 5 ,",
    "the more complicated case of arbitrary filling is discussed and in section 6 we conclude with a discussion .",
    "results for the extremal eigenvalues and some mathematical details are collected in two appendices .",
    "we consider the ground state of an infinite chain with the hamiltonian @xmath11 where we take the hopping @xmath12 and use the site energy @xmath13 to adjust the ground - state filling . with the single - particle energies @xmath14 ,",
    "the fermi momentum is given by @xmath15 .",
    "all entanglement properties are determined by the correlation matrix @xmath16 in the ground state @xmath17 in the following , we always consider a subsystem of @xmath0 consecutive sites denoted by @xmath18 or @xmath19 . since the ground state is a slater determinant , the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath2 has again free - fermion form @xcite @xmath20 and the matrix @xmath21 is given in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath22 and eigenvalues @xmath23 of the correlation matrix @xmath24 restricted to the subsystem @xmath25 where @xmath26 an important ( and intriguing ) feature is that the restricted correlation matrix @xmath27 and thus the matrix @xmath21 commute with a tridiagonal matrix @xmath8 of the form @xmath28 with elements @xmath29 this matrix can already be found in slepian s paper @xcite ( with diagonal terms differing from ( [ tridiagonal2 ] ) by an additive constant ) and was later rediscovered in @xcite .",
    "its eigenvalues will be denoted by @xmath30 and they will play a central role in the analytical treatment of the problem .",
    "the matrices @xmath27 , @xmath21 and @xmath8 have common eigenvectors and a common particle - hole symmetry .",
    "if one changes @xmath31 into @xmath32 , they transform into @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , where @xmath35 is the diagonal matrix @xmath36 . for the eigenvalues ,",
    "when ordered according to magnitude , this means @xmath37 and the corresponding eigenvectors satisfy @xmath38 these relations will be used later in the construction of @xmath21 .",
    "pictorially speaking , the @xmath39 are mostly positive for small filling ( since then most of the @xmath23 which are occupation numbers lie near zero ) and mostly negative for large filling . at half filling ,",
    "the spectrum is symmetric",
    ".    finally , if one writes in analogy to ( [ ent_ham ] ) @xmath40 the operator @xmath41 has , up to a factor of -1/2 , _ exactly _ the same form as the physical hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) but with nearest - neighbour hopping and site energies which are both multiplied by essentially the same parabolic factor increasing from the boundaries of the subsystem towards the middle .",
    "thus it has the structure of the entanglement hamiltonian ( [ conf_ham ] ) as found in conformal field theory .",
    "the actual entanglement hamiltonian @xmath2 will turn out to be similar but not identical .",
    "we present here the basic properties of @xmath21 and @xmath8 as obtained from numerical diagonalization for half filling , @xmath42 .",
    "it was noted already in @xcite that in this case the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath43 have the same low - lying eigenvalues .",

    "( the minus sign was left out in @xcite . )",
    "one sees that the small eigenvalues are practically indistinguishable on the chosen scale . only for the large ones there is a small difference .",
    "note that the largest @xmath39 are about @xmath46 which means that the corresponding @xmath23 differ from 0 or 1 by only @xmath47 .",
    "thus one needs at least 30 digits in the diagonalization of @xmath27 in order to find these @xmath39 reliably . the actual calculation with _ mathematica",
    "_ used 40 digits .",
    "the dependence of the maximal values @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the subsystem size @xmath0 is shown on the right of fig . [ eps_lam_pi2 ] . basically , both quantities increase linearly",
    ". however , the slope is not the same and therefore their difference also increases .",
    "this scaling with @xmath0 is also found analytically and will be discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the figure shows the excellent agreement between the numerics and the asymptotic results already for small @xmath0 .",

    "shown for comparison is also the nearest - neighbour hopping in @xmath53 with its strictly parabolic form .",
    "since the two matrices have the same eigenfunctions , all differences in their matrix elements are tied directly to the differences in the spectra .",
    "although these were seen to be relatively small , they occur for those eigenvalues which enter with the largest weight into the spectral representation ( [ spectral_h ] ) and thus produce significant effects . in the next section , we will derive analytical formulae for the shown quantities .     and nearest - neighbour hopping in @xmath53 ( green ) as functions of the position for @xmath45 sites . ]",
    "the half - filled case is particularly simple due to the invariance of @xmath21 under a particle - hole transformation . indeed , using the symmetry properties and of the spectrum and the eigenvectors , one can rewrite the entanglement hamiltonian as @xmath54 where the sum involves only the negative branch of the spectrum .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath55 have an analogous expression , with @xmath39 replaced by the positive @xmath30 .",

    "the subleading terms in the asymptotics of the extremal eigenvalues can also be determined with the results given in appendix a. on the other hand , the centre of the spectrum , @xmath75 , corresponds to @xmath76 and thus trivially @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , these low - lying eigenvalues obey a different type of asymptotics , scaling as @xmath78 @xcite .    in a similar fashion , the eigenvalues @xmath30 of @xmath8",
    "can be analyzed and , in the same uniform asymptotic limit , one finds there is @xmath79 due to the different definition of the tridiagonal matrix .",
    "] @xmath80 thus the scaling limit @xmath81 of the eigenvalues is , up to a factor of two , simply given by the parameter @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , instead of expressing @xmath65 and @xmath81 in terms of the spectral parameter @xmath69 , one can find a direct relation @xmath83 by expanding the integral in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "using the taylor series @xmath84 one rewrites as an infinite sum of integrals @xmath85 these integrals can be evaluated explicitly and yield @xmath86 hence , using eq .",
    ", one has the series expansion @xmath87 as expected , the coefficient of the linear ( @xmath88 ) term is @xmath89 .",
    "our next goal is to rewrite the relation between the eigenvalues in terms of the corresponding matrices .",
    "this can be done by substituting into and and taking the sum over the eigenvalues in the proper scaling limit . since only odd powers of @xmath90",
    "appear in , the symmetry used in holds for all terms and the relation can immediately be lifted to the matrix level @xmath91 the above exact series representation of @xmath92 already explains the two important qualitative features found numerically in the previous section , namely the deviation from the parabolic profile in the nearest - neighbour hopping , and the appearance of longer - range hopping .",
    "indeed , the @xmath93-th power of the matrix @xmath8 generates hopping terms up to the @xmath93-th neighbour .    to evaluate the matrix elements @xmath94 in the scaling limit",
    ", one needs a closed - form expression for the corresponding matrix elements of the powers of @xmath8 @xmath95 the summation indices run over the values @xmath96 for each @xmath97 .",
    "however , due to the tridiagonal structure of @xmath8 with the diagonal being identically zero for half - filling , the only non - vanishing terms in the sum occur for indices that satisfy the constraints @xmath98 where we defined extra indices @xmath99 and @xmath100 that are kept fixed .",
    "these constraints define a simple random walk , with the position of the walker given by @xmath101 , and with the requirement that the walk starts at site @xmath18 and arrives at @xmath102 in exactly @xmath103 steps . since the number of steps is always odd , so must be the distance covered @xmath104 , and thus the only non - vanishing matrix elements are @xmath105 , as already clear from eq . .",

    "even though the range of sites visited during the random walk grows as @xmath110 , for any _ finite _ and _ fixed _ values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 one has @xmath113 up to corrections of the order @xmath114 that vanish in the continuum limit . in choosing the proper scaling variable one",
    "should , however , take into account the reflection symmetry on the lattice , i.e. @xmath105 should be invariant under @xmath115 .",
    "the continuum limit of satisfying this constraint then reads @xmath116 where the combinatorial factor is just the number of random walks satisfying with @xmath104 and the quantity @xmath117 in @xmath118 is essentially the midpoint between initial and final site in the hopping .",
    "finally , the result must be inserted into .",

    "one thus finds that the parabolic profile is multiplied with a generalized hypergeometric function which increases monotonously from @xmath124 at @xmath125 up to its maximum of approximately @xmath126 in the middle of the interval , @xmath127 . hence , despite the continuum limit involved , the lattice result for the nearest - neighbour hopping is different from the cft prediction , with a relative deviation of approximately @xmath128 around the maximum .",

    "this corresponds to lifting to the matrix level and means that , close to the boundaries , only the small @xmath168 determine the profile .    for the maxima , @xmath216",

    "whereas @xmath220 is antisymmetric in @xmath165 and vanishes for half filling , @xmath170 , the hopping element @xmath221 is symmetric and reduces to the expression at @xmath170 , since then only the term @xmath171 survives in .",
    "both amplitudes diverge as @xmath222 .",
    "a simple approximation for the two quantities is suggested by looking at the representation .",
    "if one assumes that the two pieces scale roughly as the corresponding extremal eigenvalues @xmath223 and @xmath224 , one can write @xmath225 with the explicit formula in appendix a , one can determine the constants from the lowest terms in @xmath165 and then evaluate the right hand sides .",

    "we have determined the entanglement hamiltonian for an interval in a free - fermion chain . while this can be done with normal numerics for up to @xmath234 sites , larger systems require special routines and precisely for this case we were able to provide an analytical treatment .",

    ", we obtained a rather complete picture of @xmath2 . for half filling ,",
    "there is the well - known structure with hopping only between different sublattices , which is largest in the middle of the system . in a contour plot of the matrix @xmath21",
    ", this longer - range hopping shows up as a ridge along the anti - diagonal as found in @xcite for a slightly non - critical system . for general filling , there are also diagonal terms and hopping elements within the same sublattice . the latter show a double - peak structure , which results from negative contributions in higher powers of @xmath8 .",
    "a general filling corresponds to a critical system with fermi velocity @xmath236 , and one might have expected that a division of @xmath21 by @xmath237 is sufficient to obtain the results from those for half filling . however , while this is true for the low - lying part of the spectrum and the linear part of the hopping profile , the situation is not so simple in general .    the deviations from the conformal prediction should be seen as a lattice effect .",
    "the longer - range hopping is not really contained in a conformally invariant system . in @xcite",
    ", such terms were lumped together in order to obtain a local continuum expression and a rather good agreement with a parabolic law was found .",
    "it seems , however , that this is connected with the slight off - criticality treated there . in our case",
    ", all hopping elements for half filling have the same sign , and combining them would make the deviation from a parabola even larger .",
    "we would like to close with some further remarks .",
    "firstly , the determination of @xmath2 differs in a characteristic way from the usual entanglement calculations . for the entanglement entropy",
    ", one needs essentially only the low - lying @xmath39 , the higher ones give exponentially small contributions . for @xmath2 ,",
    "on the other hand , the high - lying eigenvalues give the largest contributions , and in this sense one is sampling different parts of the spectrum in the two cases .",
    "this was pointed out also in @xcite",
    ". however , the high eigenvectors are oscillator functions located in the centre and do not contribute to the linear variation of the nearest - neighbour hopping near the boundaries . as noted already in section 5",
    ", this behaviour comes from the low - lying eigenvalues .",
    "this allows to understand , why the recent approach to interpret the parabolic weight factor in @xmath2 as a local temperature and to calculate the entanglement entropy from the thermal equilibrium expression gives the correct asymptotic result @xcite .",
    "the logarithm @xmath238 comes from integrating @xmath239 , which is the inverse of the linear slope and thus connected with the low - lying part of the spectrum .",
    "closely related is the so - called entanglement contour introduced by chen and vidal @xcite . in this case",
    ", the term @xmath239 can be linked to the envelope @xmath240^{-1/2}$ ] of the low - lying eigenfunctions @xmath241 which enter in the quantity with the largest weight .",
    "secondly , the commuting matrix @xmath8 which played a key role in our analysis , is a bit of a mystery , because in contrast to @xmath21 it has exactly the conformal form .",
    "even more astonishingly , the same situation is found for a finite ring of @xmath201 sites .",
    "then such a @xmath8 also exists and has matrix elements which are trigonometric functions @xcite @xmath242 this is again the conformal form @xcite .",
    "of course , the diagonal terms are only determined up to a global constant , but still the feature is intriguing and one wonders if there is a deeper reason .",
    "thirdly , the case of an interval at the end of a half - infinite system is closely related to the situation considered here",
    ". it can be obtained from a subsystem of @xmath243 sites in an infinite chain by restricting oneself to the odd eigenfunctions @xmath241 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this means that the spacing and the maximal eigenvalues are about twice as large as for an interval of length @xmath0 in the infinite chain .",
    "therefore , with simple numerics , one can only reach a size of @xmath244 here . but a commuting matrix @xmath245 exists again and is one - half of the matrix @xmath8 for @xmath243 sites so that all steps in the asymptotic treatment can be repeated .",
