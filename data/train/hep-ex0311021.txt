    "the electrons in the ring are transversely polarized by the sokolov - ternov effect , and longitudinal polarization is achieved by a spin rotator in front of the hermes target .",
    "a second rotator behind the experiment restores the transverse polarization .",
    "typical beam polarizations are between 50 and 60% .",
    "the polarization of the beam is continuously monitored by two independent compton backscattering polarimeters .",
    "the beam traverses the hermes target consisting of a 40 cm long windowless storage cell which confines the injected polarized target gas to the region around the beam .",
    "the polarized atomic h and d are provided by an atomic beam source using stern - gerlach separation . a small sample of the target gas is continuously analyzed in a breit - rabi polarimeter .",
    "typical polarizations are 85% . in 1996 and 1997",

    "this is a typical forward magnetic spectrometer consisting of two symmetric halves above and below the plane of the accelerator .",
    "scattered leptons and produced hadrons are detected and identified within the angular acceptance of @xmath5 mrad horizontally and @xmath6 mrad vertically .",
    "the hadron - lepton separation is done on the basis of the signals in a transition radiation detector , an electromagnetic calorimeter and a pair of scintillator hodoscopes where the second one is preceded by a lead sheet preshower .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the world data on the polarized structure function @xmath20 for deuterium .    to    it is obvious from this figure that all experiments are basically in agreement with each other",
    "the recent preliminary hermes data considerably improve the statistical accuracy .",
    "however , there is a difference of about one order of magnitude in the scale of the various experiments , with the smc results being taken at much higher beam energy than the data from slac and hermes .",
    "the fact that the ratio is similar in the different experiments thus implies an evolution for @xmath21 that is very similar to the one for @xmath22 . just as was done succesfully in the case of unpolarized structure functions one can analyse the scaling violations observed in @xmath23 for proton and neutron targets , and deduce information on the polarization of the different quark flavours and the gluon polarization",
    "such a nlo qcd analysis was recently undertaken by hermes  @xcite .",
    "the results confirm the facts already known about the quark polarization : the quark spin contributes only 20 - 30% to the spin of the nucleon ; most of this contribution comes from the valence quarks ; the light quark sea is only little ( and negatively ) polarized .",

    "this is one of the aims of the compass experiment at cern which is now starting up .",
    "also the spin physics programme at rhic intends to determine the gluon polarization independently .",
    "the hermes experiment was specifically designed to perform accurate measurements of semi - inclusive reactions , where apart from the scattered lepton also some of the produced hadrons are detected .",
    "the idea is that these hadrons contain extra information on the quark that took part in the scattering process .",
    "this technique of flavour tagging allows the determination of the polarization of individual quark flavours directly from the spin asymmetries observed in hadron production .",
    "the quantity of interest here is the photon - nucleon asymmetry @xmath24 when a hadron of type @xmath25 is produced , which can be derived from the experimental semi - inclusive spin asymmetry @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the virtual photon depolarization , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are kinematic factors , and @xmath31 are the number of semi - inclusive events ( properly taking into account polarization of target and beam , and relative luminosity ) for target polarization parallel ( antiparallel ) to the beam polarization .",

    "similar asymmetries were derived for positive and negative pions and on a proton target .",
    "to    a striking feature of the asymmetries in this figure is the fact that the asymmetry for the @xmath32 is compatible with zero .",
    "since this is an all - sea object this already indicates that the polarization of the quark sea will be very small .    in leading order qcd and assuming factorization of the cross section one can write this asymmetry in terms of the pdf and fragmentation functions :    @xmath33    in the last equation the _ purities _",
    "@xmath34 are introduced .",
    "these are spin - independent quantities which give the probability that a hadron of type @xmath25 observed in the final state came from a struck quark of flavour @xmath35 . in that sense",
    "they are the inverse of fragmentation functions .",

    "the former were measured to high precision in unpolarized dis experiments .",
    "information on the fragmentation functions is , however , less precise .",
    "there is some information for pions , but those data are taken at quite different kinematics than relevant for hermes .",
    "hence , the purities were calculated using a monte carlo simulation of the entire scattering process .",
    "standard unpolarized parton distribution parametrizations  @xcite were used , while the fragmentation was modelled in the lund string model as implemented in jetset  @xcite .",
    "the lund model fully describes the fragmentation from the current as well as the target fragmentation region .",
    "the parameters of the model were tuned to fit the hadron multiplicities measured at hermes in order to achieve a good description of the fragmentation process at our kinematics .",
    "the resulting purities also include effects of the acceptance of the spectrometer .",

    "the polarization of the light sea flavours @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the polarization of the strange sea are consistent with zero .",
    "the data are compared to polarized pdf s derived from fits to inclusive data .",

    "the tendency of the parameterizations to yield a negative sea polarization is not confirmed by the data , not is it ruled out with the present statistical accuracy .    the flavour symmetry of the unpolarized light sea is known to be broken .",
    "this is experimentally well established through a violation of the gottfried sum rule .",

    "a clear peak at the ground state mass can be seen , thus establishing the observation of exclusive dvcs .    to    however ,",
    "at the hermes kinematics with relatively low beam energy the main source of hard photons is not dvcs but the bethe - heitler process where the photon is radiated from either the incoming or the outgoing electron .",
    "it is in principle impossible to disentangle these two processes .",
    "on the other hand the presence of two processes will also lead to interference between them and this can be exploited to access the dvcs amplitude .",
    "the interference terms can be projected out by measuring azimuthal asymmetries in single photon electroproduction .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that beam - spin ( @xmath69 ) , target - spin ( @xmath70 ) and beam - charge ( @xmath71 ) azimuthal asymmetries provide access to different combinations of the real and imaginary parts of the interfering amplitudes .",
    "it should be noted that at present hera is the only place where beam charge asymmetries can be studied because of the availability of both electron and positron beams .    in fig .",
    "[ dvcs2 ] the beam - spin azimuthal asymmetry for a proton target is shown , while fig .",
    "[ dvcs3 ] presents the results for the beam - charge asymmetry on the proton .",

    "to    it is obvious from the results presented in these figures that the dvcs - bh interference indeed dominates the distributions .",
    "the extracted @xmath72 and @xmath73 moments are in encouraging agreement with theoretical calculations based on models of gpd s . in a next step the kinematic distributions of the various moments of the azimuthal asymmetries are extracted and to be compared to more detailed calculations .    from fig .",
    "[ dvcs1 ] it can be seen that the experimental resolution of the hermes spectrometer is insufficient to allow a clear separation of exclusive and fragmentation processes . at present",
    "only the scattered electron and the real photon are detected in the forward spectrometer . to really establish exclusivity on",
    "the event level would require the detection of the recoil target proton .",
    "kinematics dictate that this proton recoils with low momentum at high angles relative to the beam line , outside the present acceptance of the hermes spectrometer .",
    "a major project at hermes now is the construction of a recoil detector to detect and identify such recoil particles .",
    "the detector will consist of three active detector parts . a silicon detector around the target cell inside the beam vacuum , a scintillating fibre tracker in a longitudinal magnetic field and a layer of scintillator strips with interspersed w - sheets as preshower material .",
    "it is planned to install the recoil detector somewhere in 2004 or 2005 and to operate it for on the order of 2 years with an unpolarized hydrogen target and polarized electron and positron beams .",
    "the higher target densities that are possible for unpolarized targets will enable hermes to obtain a large data sample on dvcs with unprecedented statistical and systematic accuracy for both beam - spin and beam - charge asymmetries .",
    "an added advantage of the recoil detector is that the determination of the momentum of the recoil proton immediately yields an accurate measurement of the momentum transfer @xmath74 to the target .",
    "this will improve the resolution in this important kinematic quantity ( see e.g. eq .  [ ji ] ) by about an order of magnitude .",
    "up to now we have only discussed the helicity structure of the nucleon .",
    "in fact there are three different structure functions which describe the parton structure of the nucleon at leading twist .",
    "these are the unpolarized structure function @xmath22 , the helicity structure function @xmath21 and a new quantity , transversity @xmath75 .",
    "the related pdf is denoted @xmath76 and gives the probability to find a transversely polarized quark in a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "it is experimentally unknown , mainly because as a chiral - odd object it can not be measured through inclusive dis . in combination with another chiral - odd object ,",
    "e.g. a fragmentation function , transversity becomes accessible . in semi - inclusive reactions",
    "it leads to single - spin azimuthal asymmetries in e.g. pion and kaon production on a transversely polarized target .",
    "such a transversely polarized target is installed in hermes since 2001 .",
    "first data have been taken with it after hera became operational again following a major luminosity upgrade for the collider experiments . however , at the present time the collected data sample is too small to make a measurement of the transversity distributions feasible .",
    "this will come in the run of 2003 and 2004 . on the other hand , hermes",
    "has already collected a large amount of data on a longitudinally polarized target .",
    "such a target is longitudinal with respect to the incoming electron beam , but does contain a small ( @xmath77 ) transverse component with respect to the virtual photon .",
    "moreover , there is a number of higher - twist distribution functions and fragmentation functions which are directly related to the transversity distribution and which also cause single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive reactions on a longitudinal target .",
    "the experimental single - spin azimuthal asymmetry for positive and negative pions on a longitudinally polarized proton target is depicted in fig .",
    "the positive pions show a clear @xmath72 modulation of the asymmetry , while this is absent for negative pions .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of @xmath45-quark dominance",
    ". a larger set of results on such asymmetries for a deuteron target was recently published  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations based on models of the transversity distribution have had some success in reproducing these data .    to",
    "some recent results from the hermes experiment at hera were presented .",
    "the analysis of the large data set on longitudinally polarized proton and deuteron targets , collected in the first run of hermes from 1995 through 2000 , is nearing completion .",
    "results of a nlo qcd analysis of the inclusive scattering show indications for a positive and possibly large gluon polarization .",
    "the results from the semi - inclusive analysis are consistent with those from the inclusive data and moreover give for the first time a flavour decomposition of the quark polarizations in 5 components .",
    "the valence quarks are seen to dominate the contribution of the quark spins to the nucleon spin , while the sea appears to have a negligible polarization .",
    "the observation of azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive reactions , here exemplified by the dvcs reaction , promises access to the new gpd s . the implementation of the recoil detector now under construction at hermes will give a much enhanced accuracy for such studies .",
    "the main thrust of the data taking of hermes at the present time is with a transversely polarized proton target . on the basis of single - spin azimuthal asymmetries observed in semi - inclusive scattering off a longitudinally polarized target",
