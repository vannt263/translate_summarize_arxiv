    "cepheid studies have acknowledged , right from the beginning , that convection should occur in cepheid envelopes , and that they should alter the properties of both the pulsations and the underlying equilibrium models . since the prandtl number characteristic of stellar material is very small , @xmath2 , and the rayleigh numbers associated with the partial ionization regions ( pir ) are enormous , @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 , stellar convection is far into the hard turbulent regime ( krishnamurti & howard @xcite ) .",
    "the cooler cepheid stars are believed to have the more extensive convection zones , leading to pulsational stability beyond the red edge of the standard instability strip ( is ) .",
    "because of the estimated inefficiency of convection and because of the difficulties of treating turbulent convection , a lot of work has disregarded it altogether , the hope having been that , except for providing a red edge , convection would play a subdued role . and",
    "purely radiative models have indeed provided a reasonable overall agreement with observations .",
    "more recently it has become increasingly clear that an impasse has been reached with radiative models , and that it is not possible to improve the agreement with observations ( e.g. buchler @xcite ) . in particular , the amplitudes of pulsation are systematically too large .",
    "no consistent set of pseudo - viscous parameters can correctly limit the amplitudes of _ both _ fundamental and first overtone pulsations without adversely affecting the stability of the corresponding limit cycles , and the agreement with observation .",
    "the new eros and macho data of the low metallicity magellanic cloud cepheids ( buchler et al .",
    "@xcite ) reveals further disagreement between stellar evolution and radiative stellar pulsation models .",
    "clearly some additional physical dissipation is missing in the radiative codes ( see also kovcs @xcite ) , and turbulence and convection are the primary suspects .",
    "simulation of even the simplest turbulent convection ( tc ) problem is a formidable numerical challenge ; to adequately resolve the many time- and length - scales of fully turbulent 3d convection at stellar rayleigh and prandtl numbers is totally out of question , and astrophysicists have been looking for 1d recipes to give an approximate , but acceptable treatment of this phenomenon . thus the 1925 mixing length picture of prandtl was readily adapted to stellar envelopes by bhm - vitense , and subsequently reformulated in many variations , all of which are equivalent for time - independent problems ( for an overview , see baker @xcite ) .",
    "but time - independent mlt was never able to resolve the red edge problem , mostly because it is time - dependent dissipation introduced by eddy viscosity that provides a clear red edge , as we will show in   [ limsection ] .",
    "spiegel @xcite first extended mlt to the time - dependent and nonlocal cases .",
    "the earliest attempts to include a time - dependent mixing length model in pulsation ( gough @xcite , unno @xcite ) were not successful because they were too local in space .",
    "subsequently , gough s theory was extended to be less local , and eventually was used in a full linearization of solar modes ( balmforth @xcite ) , analogous to what we have done here .",
    "unno s theory was also developed ( castor @xcite ) as a diffusion model , and simplified to a single equation for the turbulent energy @xmath6 by stellingwerf ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent applications of this and similar turbulent diffusion recipes have been made by gonczi & osaki @xcite , bono & stellingwerf @xcite , gehmeyr & winkler @xcite , hereafter gw ) and kuhfuss ( @xcite ) . further closely related models also appear in the literature , such as those of canuto ( @xcite ) but have yet to be applied .",
    "all 1d model tc equations contain several dimensionless , order unity parameters that are directly related to the physical quantities of the model . in principle",
    ", the validity of the 1d model equation can be checked against experiments or against detailed 3d simulations of turbulent convection , and values of the unknown parameters can be extracted .",
    "however , neither such experiments nor such simulations are presently available .",
    "we are obliged to calibrate these parameters indirectly with the help of observational astronomical constraints , as suggested more than a decade ago by stellingwerf ( @xcite ) . in the best outcome",
    ", observational constraints could select one model in favor of the others . on the other hand we might discover that single equation models for turbulent convection are insufficient , or that plumes ( e.g. rieutord & zahn @xcite ) play an essential role in the convective transport .",
    "this programme has recently been initiated by incorporating these recipes into hydrodynamic pulsation codes .",
    "fully nonlinear models have been used to determine the stability properties of convective pulsators ( e.g. bono & stellingwerf @xcite , bono & marconi @xcite ) , but this approach is inefficient , and unsuitable when a large number of models is required .",
    "the approach we follow in this paper is to compute the linear nonadiabatic properties directly by linearizing the hydrodynamic equations about the equilibrium model and by then computing the linear eigenvalues , a procedure which is relatively fast .",
    "this allows us to perform an extensive survey of the sensitivity to the tc parameters .",
    "we have adopted a tc model equation that consists of a single diffusion equation for the turbulent energy and that includes the effects of the turbulent stress , turbulent energy flux and turbulent energy production on the mean momentum and energy ; our model is essentially that used by gehmeyr ( @xcite ) . in the following , we reproduce our pde s for the purpose of notation and for completeness .",
    "in addition to @xmath7 we have the momentum equation , modified to include the effects of turbulent stress , that are cast here in the form of a turbulent pressure and an eddy pressure @xmath8 the pressure @xmath9 and specific energy @xmath10 represent the combined gas and radiation quantities .",

    "the turbulent and eddy pressures are given by : @xmath17 @xmath18 the mixing length @xmath19 appears as the product @xmath20 to emphasize that it is taken to be some fraction @xmath21 of the pressure scale height @xmath22 .",
    "the convective and turbulent fluxes are : @xmath23 @xmath24 the source of turbulence that appears in @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where the instability criterion has been embedded into the convenient , dimensionless entropy gradient : @xmath27_{\\scriptscriptstyle + } \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the thermal expansion coefficient , and all other symbols have their usual meanings .    in the absence of turbulent diffusion ,",
    "the formulations of stellingwerf ( 1982 ) , of gw , and ours are equivalent ; all three reduce to time - dependent local mlt in this approximation . with the diffusion term included , however , the formulations are no longer identical .",
    "( [ fc ] ) shows we have taken the convective flux to be directly proportional to the entropy gradient @xmath29 , in the manner of gehmeyr ; but in eq .",
    "( [ ete ] ) we have chosen to describe the turbulent energy as in stellingwerf . while this would represent an inconsistency in entirely local mlt , here it simply implies a different evaluation of the correlation @xmath30 in the definition of the source term , @xmath31 . in single equation models such as this ,",
    "the absence of a dynamic equation for @xmath30 necessitates such ad hoc evaluations .",
    "the tc recipe contains seven dimensionless parameters of order unity denoted by @xmath32 s .",
    "it is important to test the sensitivity of the results to variations of the @xmath32 s in some reasonable range , say @xmath33 .",
    "however , these parameters also serve as direct connections to the physical inputs of the model .",
    "for example : @xmath34 , in the absence of diffusion , allows us to adjust the timescale of the turbulent energy growth and decay ( gw ) ; @xmath21 controls the mixing length as a function of the local pressure scale height ; @xmath35 represents a constant eddy viscosity ; and @xmath36 is related to the adiabatic compressibility index @xmath37 of turbulent eddies .    in our numerical study eqs .",
    "( [ mom])([ete ] ) are differenced in the spirit of the fraley scheme ( see stellingwerf @xcite and buchler , kollth & marom @xcite ) using the lagrangean mass as the radial variable .",
    "in cepheids the pirs are the source both of convection and of pulsational driving .",
    "because convection causes a structural rearrangement of the stellar model , convective stars can have different properties from their radiative counterparts even if the direct interplay between convection and pulsation is disregarded . in our linearized code",
    "it is possible to adjust parameters of either the equilibrium model , the linearized model , or both ; we can therefore show the separate effects of the equilibrium structure and of the interaction of convection and pulsation on the stability of the star . we illustrate this dichotomy in   [ limsection ] by decoupling the turbulent and hydrodynamic perturbations . but",
    "first , we discuss the properties of the static equilibrium models .",
    "the construction of the tc equilibrium models proceeds in two steps : first , we integrate the time - independent form of eqs .",
    "( [ mom][ete ] ) from the surface inward , but in the absence of turbulent diffusion ( @xmath38 = 0 ) .",
    "this integration becomes the initial guess from which we solve the complete time - independent equation by newton - raphson iteration .",
    "( as an alternative we could iteratively solve eqs .",
    "( [ mom ]  [ teq ] ) followed by eq .  [ ete ] . )    in order to perform the extensive survey of this paper we had to use a relatively coarse zoning of 180 mesh - points , viz .",
    "40 uniform zones in from the surface , then increasing geometrically up to an inner temperature of 2.5million k. just as for the radiative models , it is important to provide a grid point right in the center of the sharp hydrogen pir ( unless a very fine mesh is used ) .",
    "we accomplish this by constraining the equilibrium model to have one anchor zone at ( @xmath39 ) , holding this anchor fixed in the iteration to a full tc model .",
    "failure to do so will result in erratic fluctuations of the growth - rates along sequences of models .",
    "we also find that for models with strong convection which penetrates deeply into the stellar envelope it becomes necessary to refine the zoning in the fe  pir , i.e. around 200,000k .",
    "we turn now to the properties of the equilibrium models .",
    "-5pt      along a cepheid sequence ( with fixed @xmath1 , @xmath0 and composition ) the size of the negative entropy gradients increases when  decreases , causing convection to become more vigorous and to penetrate deeper into the stellar envelope .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ teffig ] for our standard sequence of models with decreasing , for which we adopt the parameters @xmath1=5 , @xmath0=2090 , and with = 4300 , 4500 , 4700 , 4900k , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we use the compositional parameters @xmath40=0.70 , @xmath41=0.02 .",
    "similarly , for the tests of this paper we adopt the _ standard _ tc parameters , viz .",
    "@xmath42=5 . , @xmath38=1 . , @xmath35=3",
    ", @xmath21 = 0.375 , @xmath43=0.75 , @xmath34=4 . , and @xmath44=2/3 .",
    "these values are just used for reference purposes and are not meant to be the values to be adopted ultimately .",
    "a detailed calibration of these parameters using data from observations is in progress and will be addressed in a subsequent publication .    in fig .",
    "[ teffig ] ( top ) we display the fractional turbulent energy @xmath45 for the model sequence , where @xmath46 .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding turbulent pressure ratio @xmath47 is similar , but slightly broadened because of the @xmath48 dependence of @xmath49 . in the middle figure",
    "we show the relative turbulent pressure gradient @xmath50 .",
    "even though the turbulent pressure generally does not exceed a few percent , its gradient plays a more important role in the hydrostatic balance of the convection zones .",
    "the bottom figure displays the fraction of total heat flux that is carried by turbulent convection . in the hydrogen pir",
    "it is close to 100% .    in fig .",
    "[ teffig ] the temperature range 4300  4900k corresponds roughly to the width of the is for these models ; the coolest model , near the red edge , is seen to have the most widespread turbulent pressure and the deepest and most efficient domain of convective flux .",
    "we point out that it is the _",
    "least _ convective models that have the largest turbulent pressure gradients .",
    "this is an indirect result of those models being less turbulent and consequently less diffusive .",
    "the convection zones are of course associated with the pirs . in fig .",
    "[ teffig ] the h , he@xmath51 , and he@xmath52 convection zones are all visible .",
    "the maxima of the convective peaks stay approximately at the same temperatures , but the structural changes of the models with decreasing  causes them to move to higher pressures . for the cooler model , the convection zone extends from the h pir all the way to the fe peak pir .    the convective flux @xmath53 ( eq .  [ fc ] ) , depends on the parameter @xmath42 which we have held fixed in the sequence of fig .  [ teffig ] .",
    "we now consider the changes that occur when @xmath42 is increased for a model with fixed  = 4700k and with the same @xmath1 and @xmath0 as in fig .  [ teffig ] .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ acfig ] shows that a decrease in the strength of the convective flux ( @xmath42 ) is remarkably similar to increasing the effective temperature of the model .",
    "-5pt      the mixing length is the characteristic length - scale of the turbulent eddies .",
    "therefore @xmath21 appears in a number of places , and in particular in the turbulent diffusivities , and @xmath21 represents a measure of the nonlocality of turbulence .",
    "its effect on the spatial distribution of turbulent pressure and convective flux is dramatic , and qualitatively different from that which results from changes to @xmath42 or . in fig .",
    "[ amlt ] we see that the turbulent quantities energy ( top ) , and pressure gradient ( middle ) become very localized to the unstable regions even when @xmath21 is made only slightly smaller than the standard value of @xmath21 = 0.375 that was adopted in figs .",

    "the convective timescale is then given by @xmath59 .",
    "the pclet number for our models is large in the convective region ( bottom fig .",

    "truly efficient convection ought to remove the unstable gradient that produces it . in fig .",
    "[ structure ] , top and middle , we show the density and entropy profiles of two convective models .",
    "we see that in fact convection does not manage to remove the density inversion .",
    "it reduces the size of the negative entropy gradient by an order of magnitude compared to the radiative model , but the remaining entropy gradient is still strong , and it is shifted to the wings of the original convection zone .    -5pt    [ [ the - nusselt - number - nus ] ] the nusselt number @xmath60",

    "the slope lies between 0.45 and 0.53 throughout the convective region , a value that agrees well with the theoretical upper limit , considering the strong gradients and rapid variations of the physical quantities ( of @xmath69 among other things ) in the convective regions .",

    "thus the overtone cepheids with the longest observed periods ( @xmath105 ) give a strong constraint on the value of the @xmath32 s ( and on the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath0 relation ) . for reference",
    "we have drawn iso - period lines @xmath106 = 5 and 10  d ( solid lines ) and @xmath105 = 2 and 5d ( dotted ) in figs .",
    "[ mltis ] and [ cis ] .",
    "overall , changes in the values of the @xmath42 and @xmath21 cause small shifts of the isoperiod lines .",
    "as already mentioned most of these shifts are due to the structural rearrangement caused by convection .",
    "that is why @xmath35 , which does not appear in the static equilibrium equations , has almost no effect .",
    "the periods are only slightly affected by convection near the blue edge , but the pulsation ",
    "convection coupling can cause more appreciable changes near the red edge for the more turbulent models .",
    "we conclude that , just from a visual inspection of these is diagrams , it is possible to delineate the acceptable ranges of the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath35 and @xmath42 . roughly speaking the parameters with reasonable looking",
    "is s lie on a 2d surface in the ( @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath21 ) parameter space .",
    "table  i quantifies this visual result over a more extensive range of the @xmath32 parameters .",
    ".25 cm    rcrcr  @xmath42  &  &  @xmath21  &  &  @xmath35   + 0.5 & & 0.375 & & 1.50 + 0.5 & & 0.500 & & 1.00 + 3.0 & & 0.150 & & 9.00 + 3.0 & & 0.328 & & 3.00 + 3.0 & & 0.420 & & 1.00 + 10.0 & & 0.100 & & 25.00 + 10.0 & & 0.200 & & 6.00 +    this flexibility in the @xmath32 values appears fortunate because ultimately we want not just to fit observed fundamental and first overtone is s for the galaxy , but also for the magellanic clouds which have lower @xmath41 values .",
    "in addition , the wealth of observational cepheid fourier decomposition parameters of the ( nonlinear ) light and radial velocity curves in these galaxies will need to be fitted .",
    "we have thus narrowed down the parameter space on which more detailed calibrations will be made that take into account the wealth of observations .",
    "however , we have not made any is diagrams showing the effects of the other four @xmath32 s because they seem to play a lesser role , at least at the level of accuracy considered in this parameter survey .",
    "purely radiative cepheid models can not satisfactorily account for all observational data , and this has forced us to include turbulence and convection in our cepheid models .",
    "we have adopted a simple 1d model diffusion equation for turbulent convection ( tc ) that can easily be incorporated into a radial stellar pulsation code . although there is no guarantee that such a single 1d equation can satisfactorily approximate the effects of turbulence and convection it is worth exploring to what extent we can obtain agreement with observation .",
    "the model tc equations contain several dimensionless , order unity parameters that are directly related to the physical quantities of the model that need to be calibrated with the help of observational astronomical constraints .    instead of performing time - consuming fully nonlinear hydrodynamic computations of the pulsations",
    ", we have developed a code to perform an efficient linear nonadiabatic stability analysis of the models .",
    "this has allowed us to make an exploration of the sensitivity to the free parameters of the tc equation , both of the structure of the equilibrium cepheid models and of their linear properties .    in agreement with other studies",
    "we find that the static cepheid models exhibit convection primarily in their h and he partial ionization regions ( pirs ) , although in some parameter range a convective zone also appears in the fe pir . for strongly convective models the separate convective zones merge into a large one that penetrates up to 320,000k .",
    "the coupling of pulsation and convection also modifies the linear properties of the pulsational modes , as expected .",
    "it also creates a new branch of turbulent diffusion modes linear that our stability analysis establishes to be extremely damped , fortunately for our 1d tc recipe .",
    "these additional modes thus can not create havoc numerically or physically .",
    "this large damping is consistent with the convective timescales being very short compared to the periods of the vibrational of the excited modes which themselves are short compared to the growth - times .",
    "our survey shows that the stability of the fundamental and first overtone modes depends on all the tc parameters , but that it is dominated by ( 1 ) the convective flux , ( 2 ) the eddy viscosity , and ( 3 ) the mixing length .",
    "generally , the effects of eddy viscosity and mixing length are greater in the higher overtones .    in agreement with other much less detailed tc studies",
    "we find that reasonable @xmath32 parameter values exist for which is s of the galactic cepheid f and o1 have an acceptable range of temperatures . in this paper we have made no effort to narrow down the acceptable range of tc parameters by using the large amount of observational information .",
    "an application of the tc code to a broader sample of cepheid models and its comparison to the large data base of galactic , and magellanic cloud cepheids is in progress , as is an extension to rr  lyrae stars .",
