    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binaries in which the accreting object ( the primary ) is a white dwarf ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "x - ray emission in cvs is most likely associated with the accretion process , which is capable of shock - heating accreted material up to high temperatures ( @xmath1 1050  kev ) .",
    "their accretion geometry is strongly influenced by the magnetic field of the primary .",
    "non - magnetic systems have undisrupted accretion disks that connect to the white dwarf surface via a boundary layer @xcite . in magnetic systems ,",
    "the accretion stream follows the primary s magnetic field lines , and is close to vertical when it hits the surface ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "the emergent x - ray spectrum is expected to be the sum of emission from plasmas over a continuous temperature distribution , from the shock temperature to the white dwarf photospheric temperature .",
    "seven cvs were observed with _ chandra _  hetg by 2002 march ; we have obtained these data from the archive and analyzed them using ciao 2.2.1 .",
    "the objects are four magnetic cvs of the intermediate polar ( ip ) class ( ex  hya , v1223  sgr , ao  psc , and gk  per ) , two dwarf novae ( ss  cyg  and u  gem ) , and one old nova ( v603  aql ) . for cvs with multiple hetg observations ,",
    "we have chosen to analyze one spectrum per system ( quiescent spectrum of ss  cyg , and one of two similar spectra of gk  per ) .",
    "previous publications from these data exist for ex  hya  @xcite and u  gem  @xcite .",
    "these seven x - ray spectra divide unambiguously into two types .",
    "spectra of the first type are well fit by a simple cooling flow model , whereas spectra of the second type are well described by a simple model of a photoionized plasma .",
    "combined first - order ( @xmath2 ) meg spectra of cooling flow cvs and of photoionized cvs are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cool ] and [ fig : phot ] , respectively , and are discussed below in  [ sec : cool ] and  [ sec : phot ] , respectively .",
    "the four cv spectra of ex  hya , v603  aql , u  gem , and ss  cygshown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] are strikingly similar . these spectra exhibit a smooth continuum , strong h- and he - like ion emission lines of o , ne ,",
    "mg , al , si , and s , and strong emission from ions spanning the entire fe  l - shell complex ( - ) . in the heg spectra ( not shown ) , h- and he - like fe lines are strong , while the intensity of the fe fluorescence line varies from system to system .    the observed wide range and strengths of emission from h- and he - like ions , the level and shape of the continuum ( suggesting bremsstrahlung ) , and , in particular , the comparable strengths of emission across the full range of fe  l - shell ions are all consistent with expectations for a multitemperature thermal plasma with a relatively flat emission measure distribution .",
    "the flatness of this distribution is further indicative of an isobaric cooling flow , which assumes only that the gas releases all of its energy in the form of optically - thin radiation as it cools in a steady - state flow .",
    "the two main parameters of this model are the maximum temperature , @xmath0 , and the overall normalization , which directly gives the total mass flow rate .",
    "fits to the spectra using mkcflow @xcite ( with a uniform velocity broadening and an interstellar absorber ) in xspec @xcite are shown in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] with model parameters listed in table  [ tab : cool ] .",
    "we obtain the same @xmath0 of 20  kev for ex  hya , v603  aql , and u  gem , but a @xmath0 of 80  kev for ss  cyg , accounting for the stronger continuum in this source .",
    "the total mass flow rates listed in table  [ tab : cool ] , which we have not scaled to the best - estimate distances to these cvs , are nonetheless entirely reasonable .",
    "these high resolution observations unambiguously demonstrate that post - shock plasmas in some cvs are cooling flows , as originally pointed out by @xcite and applied to cvs by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the mkcflow model developed for clusters of galaxies can be used to fit cv spectra , while it is now known that clusters are poorly described by such a model @xcite .",
    "our models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] ) generally predict line strengths to within a factor of two , setting the maximum level for abundance differences from our assumption ( solar ) .",
    "some of these discrepancies , such as in the line complex , are more likely due to effects arising from line opacity , density , or uv irradiation , rather than abundance ( especially given the concordance of the  lines ) .",
    "we also note that he - like triplets ( e.g. , , , and ) , whenever data quality is sufficiently high to be resolvable , show evidence for forbidden - to - intercombination line conversion through excitation of the long - lived 2 @xmath3s@xmath4 level up to the 2 @xmath3p multiplet @xcite ; both electron collisional excitation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and photoexcitation due to uv photons from the white dwarf surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) are potentially important in driving this conversion .      the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] are noticeably different from those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] , but are very similar to one another . in particular , v1223  sgr  and ao  psc  both have a hard , power - law - like continuum , and strong lines from medium z elements , but the fe l - shell emission is limited only to lines , with no detectable - lines .",
    "this does not indicate a low fe abundance , since we detect strong k@xmath5 lines ( h - like , he - like , and fluorescence ) in the heg spectra ( not shown ) .",
    "gk  per  has a continuum that is harder still , and shows h- and he - like ions but little fe l - shell emission .",
    "this type of emission line spectrum is incompatible with cooling flow plasma .",
    "instead , it resembles the expectations for photoionized plasma @xcite , and the observed spectrum of the prototype seyfert  2 , ngc  1068 , for which photoionization origin has been demonstrated @xcite , confirming the earlier suggestion by @xcite .",
    "we model these spectra with the xspec photoionization model photoion @xcite .",
    "we assume that the observed continuum of v1223  sgr  and ao  psc  is that which drives the line emission , while a similar continuum ( shown as the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) drives the photoionization in gk  per  but is obscured along our particular line of sight .",
    "we also assume the line emission is unabsorbed in all three systems .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all lines remain completely unsaturated at all ionic column densities , due to radial velocity distribution widths of thousands of km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this last assumption is necessary to explain the strong resonance lines in the he - like triplets , which are not predicted by traditional photoionization models @xcite . with these assumptions , we find that a simple model of a photoionized cone of plasma fits the data very well .",
    "we show the model fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] in red ( showing the absorbed continuum plus unabsorbed lines in the case of gk  per ) , and list the corresponding model parameters in table  [ tab : phot ] . included in this table",
    "are the lower limits to the accretion rates necessary to power the photoionizing continuum .",
    "these values are similar to the mass flow rates in the cooling - flow cvs .",
    "the presence of line emission from to in all spectra is consistent with a broad , relatively flat distribution in log ionization parameter , as inferred for ngc  1068  @xcite , and with near solar abundances .",
    "the exception is the large nitrogen to oxygen ratio in gk  per , mirroring the unusual uv line ratios @xcite , and may suggest an abundance anomaly for this system with an evolved secondary @xcite . as with the cooling flow cases ,",
    "the he - like triplets again exhibit conversion of the forbidden to intercombination lines , suggesting high electron density and/or a strong , ambient uv radiation field .",
    "we have shown that a simple cooling flow model is capable of reproducing the x - ray spectra of four cvs , while a photoionization model can successfully reproduce the strikingly different spectra of three other cvs .",
    "the latter are all magnetic systems of the ip type , while the former is a mixture of ex  hya , an unusual ip , and non - magnetic systems . both the fact that the x - ray spectral types almost coincide with the classification into magnetic and non - magnetic systems , and the somewhat surprising fact that this match is not exact , requires explanation .",
    "the difference between the two x - ray spectral types may be the specific accretion rate ( accretion rate per unit area ) .",
    "in most ips , the magnetic field collimates the flow onto small regions ( @xmath70.2% of the white dwarf surface in xy  ari : @xcite ) .",
    "ex  hya , however , is thought to have a much lower specific accretion rate than typical ips , creating a tall , lower density , shock @xcite .",
    "the resultant top - hat geometry of the post - shock region will allow the cooling flow x - rays to escape the post - shock region from the side without having to travel through the pre - shock flow .",
    "the boundary layer in non - magnetic cvs probably cover a much larger area than the spot on xy  ari .",
    "this would lead to a specific accretion rate that is always low enough to allow the x - rays to escape freely . in this view , all cvs with low specific accretion rate ( all non - magnetic systems , as well as some magnetic systems ) should show a cooling flow - like x - ray spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , typical ips such as v1223  sgr  and ao  psc  probably have a high specific accretion rate , leading to a pillbox geometry which does not allow the cooling flow spectrum to escape freely .",
    "if true , these systems are also powered by the cooling flow continuum ( compare the measured @xmath8 in table  [ tab : cool ] with the inferred values in table  [ tab : phot ] ) , which is differentially absorbed",
    ". the apparent lack of the cooling - flow line emission may be due to a larger optical depth along the line of sight to the post - shock region than to the photoionized plasma , allowing the latter to dominate the observed spectrum .",
    "although a model of a multitemperature bremsstrahlung continuum with multiple partial covering absorbers can reproduce the observed continuum shape , this does beg the question of why we observe such highly similar hard continua in v1223  sgr  and ao  psc .",
    "if this can not be explained without an excessive degree of fine - tuning , we may be forced to explore an alternative origin of the ionizing continuum .",
    "evidence that the photoionized emission arises from pre - shock flow comes from the inferred large radial velocity distribution , which is present only in the near free - fall pre - shock flow .",
    "further evidence may come from gk  per . the shorter - wavelength , higher - ionization line strengths are significantly weaker in this source than in the other two .",
    "if , for gk  per , we discard the assumption that the line emission is unabsorbed , and instead assume that its line emission spectrum is intrinsically similar to that of v1223  sgr  and ao  psc , then gk  per  must be differentially obscured , with obscuration increasing with ionization parameter all the way down to the photoionizing continuum .",
    "this favors a spatially - stratified ionization model , which should arise naturally in an accretion flow , rather than the intrinsic density distribution that leads to the range of ionization in ngc  1068  @xcite .",
    "the existence of two types of x - ray spectra in the hetg range among accreting cvs is beyond doubt .",
    "however , our interpretation is admittedly somewhat tentative , and that other system parameters ( such as the primary mass and the inclination angle ) may also play an important role in shaping the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "it is also possible that there are yet other types of cv x - ray spectrum in the hetg range , such as the wind - scattered x - rays seen at longer wavelengths ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of a larger sample of cvs , and more detailed analyses of the existing spectra , should be helpful in clarifying both points .",
