    "an important characteristic of thz laser radiation is its state of polarization .",
    "the detection of the polarization state , in particular the orientation of the electric field vector of linear polarized radiation and/or the ellipticity of transmitted , reflected or scattered , light represents a powerful technique for analyzing the optical anisotropy of various media such as solids , solid surfaces , plasmas , and biological tissues .",
    "the established way to gain information about the polarization state is the use of optical elements , which allow to determine optical path differences .",
    "here we report on an all - electric room temperature semiconductor detector systems which provide information about the polarization state of thz laser radiation .",
    "the operation of detectors is based on the photogalvanic effects in semiconductor quantum well ( qws ) structures of suitably low symmetry .",
    "the time constant of photogalvanic currents is determined by the momentum relaxation time of electrons which is in the range of picoseconds at room temperature .",
    "this allows to measure the ellipticity of thz laser radiation with sub - nanosecond time resolution .",
    "preliminary results demonstrating the method have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present a detailed study of the detection principle comprising the phenomenological theory of the physical effects used for detection , the coupling of detector signals to stokes parameters  @xcite , the application of the method to low intensity cw lasers , spectral behaviour in the terahertz range , dependence on the angle of incidence and temperature .",
    "finally , we extend the method to the detection of the azimuth angle of linear polarized thz radiation .",
    "the photogalvanic effect denotes the generation of an electric current in a homogeneous semiconductor sample by homogeneous irradiation .",
    "this is in contrast to photovoltaic effects , like used in solar cells , where optically generated electric charges are separated by potential barriers .",
    "homogeneity is usually realized in the terahertz range because of the weak absorption of radiation . on a macroscopic level",
    "the photogalvanic effect can be described by writing the @xmath0 current @xmath1 in powers of the fourier amplitude of the electric field of radiation @xmath2 at the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the first possibly non - vanishing term is given by  @xcite @xmath4 where the expansion coefficient @xmath5 is a third rank tensor and @xmath6 is the complex conjugate of @xmath7 .    the external product @xmath8 can be re - written as a sum of a symmetric and an antisymmetric product @xmath9 , \\ ] ] with @xmath10 and @xmath11 = ( e_\\mu e^*_\\nu - e_\\nu e^*_\\mu ) /2 $ ] .",
    "this decomposition corresponds to a splitting of @xmath8 into its real and imaginary part .",
    "the symmetric term is real while the antisymmetric term is purely imaginary .",
    "due to the contraction of the tensor @xmath12 with @xmath8 the same algebraic symmetries are projected onto the last two indices of @xmath12 . the real part of @xmath12 is symmetric in the indices @xmath13 whereas the imaginary part is antisymmetric .",
    "antisymmetric tensor index pairs can be reduced to a single pseudovector index using the levi ",
    "civita totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath14 . applying this simplification",
    "we obtain for the current due to the antisymmetric part of @xmath8 @xmath15 = \\sum_{\\rho } \\gamma_{\\lambda\\rho}i ( \\bm e \\times \\bm e^*)_\\rho = \\sum_{\\rho } \\gamma_{\\lambda\\rho}\\hat{e}_\\rho p_{\\rm circ}\\:e_0 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a real second rank pseudotensor , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the degree of light circular polarization ( helicity ) and the unit vector pointing in the direction of light propagation , respectively .    in summary",
    "we find for the total photocurrent @xmath20 where @xmath21 . in this equation",
    "the photogalvanic effect is decomposed into two distinct phenomena , the linear photogalvanic effect ( lpge ) and the circular photogalvanic effect ( cpge ) , described by the first and the second term on the right - hand side , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we note that the second term also describes the optically induced spin - galvanic effect  @xcite .",
    "both photogalvanic currents have been observed in various semiconductors and are theoretically well understood ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ currentgeneral15 ] ) follows that photogalvanic currents are determined by the degree of linear polarization and the orientation of the polarization ellipse as well as the handedness of elliptical polarization . in the following",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ currentgeneral15 ] ) for c@xmath22 symmetry corresponding to the structure applied for detection , first for linear polarized radiation ( lpge ) and afterwords for elliptically polarized radiation ( both lpge and cpge ) .",
    "the lpge makes possible to determine the orientation of polarization of linearly polarized radiation .",
    "in fact lpge represents a microscopic ratchet .",
    "the periodically alternating electric field superimposes a directed motion on the thermal velocity distribution of carriers in spite of the fact that the oscillating field neither does exert a net force on the carriers nor induce a potential gradient .",
    "the directed motion is due to non - symmetric random relaxation and scattering in the potential of a non - centrosymmetric medium .",
    "the linear photogalvanic effect is usually observed under linearly polarized optical excitation but may also occur under elliptically polarized radiation .",
    "it is allowed only in non - centrosymmetric media of piezoelectric crystal classes where nonzero invariant components of the third rank tensor @xmath23 exist .",
    "lpge was studied in bulk crystals and has also been observed in quantum wells .    the lpge in bulk crystals has been proposed for detection of the plane of polarization of linearly polarized radiation in ref .  @xcite . in bulk gaas crystals of t@xmath24 symmetry irradiation with",
    "linearly polarized radiation propagating in the [ 111]-crystallographic direction yields transverse currents along the [ 1@xmath250 ] and [ 11@xmath26 axes .",

    "equations  ( [ td ] ) show that simultaneous measurements of the two currents allows one immediately to obtain @xmath28 , i.e. to determine the space orientation of the radiation polarization plane .",
    "a polarization analyzer made of gaas crystals has been proved to give a reasonable signal from 9@xmath31 m to about 400@xmath31 m wavelength at room temperature .",
    "application of gaas quantum well structures extends the material class suitable for detection of linear polarization . for the detection of the radiation polarization state the most convenient geometry requires a normal incidence of radiation on the sample surface .",
    "a symmetry analysis shows that in order to obtain an lpge photoresponse at normal incidence the symmetry of the qw structure must be as low as the point group c@xmath32 .",
    "this group contains only two elements : the identity and one mirror reflection .",
    "this can easily be obtained in qw structures by choosing a suitable crystallographic orientation .",
    "this condition is met , for instance , in ( 113)- or asymmetric ( 110)-grown structures .",
    "we introduce here a coordinate system @xmath33 defined by @xmath34,\\quad y\\parallel [ 33\\bar{2}],\\quad   z\\parallel [ 113 ] \\label{coordinateb}\\ ] ] which is convenient for ( 113)-grown samples used here for detectors . in this coordinate system",
    "@xmath35 is normal to the only non - identity symmetry element of c@xmath22 , the mirror plane .",
    "the point group c@xmath22 allows an lpge current at normal incidence of the radiation on the sample because in this case the tensor @xmath36 has nonzero components @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . then after eq .",

    "a current response due to lpge is allowed for both @xmath35- and @xmath43-directions . like in the bulk detector",
    "addressed above , eqs .",
    "( [ currentequ43 ] ) and ( [ currentequ43b ] ) show that measuring lpge currents simultaneously in @xmath35 and @xmath43 direction allows one to determine unambiguously the azimuth angle @xmath42 of linearly polarized radiation .",
    "while lpge gives an experimental access to the state of linear polarization it can not be used to determine the ellipticity of radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "the circular photogalvanic effect depends on the helicity of the radiation field and can not be induced by linearly polarized excitation .",
    "hence , this effect may be applied to measure the ellipticity of radiation .",
    "the cpge occurs in gyrotropic media only , as it is mediated by a second rank pseudotensor . on a macroscopic level the photocurrent of cpge",
    "is described by the phenomenological equation  ( [ currentgeneral14 ] ) yielding @xmath44 , where the radiation helicity @xmath18 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the amplitudes of right and left handed circularly polarized radiation , respectively .",
    "the helicity can easily be varied by passing linearly polarized light at normal incidence through a birefringent @xmath48-plate ( see figs .",
    "[ setup1 ]  and [ phi1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the rotation of the quarter - wave plate by the angle @xmath49 between the optical axis of the @xmath48-plate and the direction of the initial radiation polarization changes the azimuth angle , the shape of the polarization ellipse and the orientation of the rotation of the electric field vector ( see fig .",
    "[ phi1 ] , top ) .    in structures of c@xmath22 symmetry the photogalvanic current due to elliptically polarized radiation at normal incidence is after eq .",
    "( [ currentgeneral15 ] ) given by  @xcite    @xmath50    the cpge current is described by the the second term on the right side of the first equation .",
    "it flows perpendicular to the mirror reflection plane of c@xmath22 corresponding to the @xmath35 coordinate being parallel to @xmath51 $ ] because the tensor @xmath52 has a non - vanishing component @xmath53 .",
    "the lpge current , given by the first term on the right side of the eq.([currentequ44 ] ) and by the eq.([currentequ44b ] ) , can be generated in both @xmath35 and @xmath43 directions .",
    "it reflects only the projection of the electric field of the elliptical polarized radiation on the @xmath35 and @xmath43 axes and does not contain any information about the radiation ellipticity .",
    "equation  ( [ currentequ44 ] ) shows that in general , the photogalvanic current excited by elliptically polarized radiation consists of cpge and lpge .",
    "in fact the interference of both effects , cpge and lpge , have been observed in certain materials  @xcite .",
    "however , cpge and lpge are completely independent phenomena .",
    "one or the other effect can dominate the photocurrent . as we show below , by proper choice of materials ,",
    "the information about radiation helicity can be obtained by structures with dominating contribution of the cpge which is proportional to the radiation helicity and carries the information about the direction of polarization vector rotation .",
    "additional detection of a signal by a structure with dominating contribution of the lpge provides the necessary information about azimuth angle of the polarization ellipse .      for reference",
    "it is necessary to know the power of radiation which must be determined by a polarization independent sensor . for this purpose",
    "we apply the photon drag effect that is based on the transfer of linear momentum from photons to charge carriers in semiconductors .",
    "phenomenologically it is described by  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a forth rank tensor and @xmath56 the wavevector of radiation . as a detector element we used bulk",

    "the angle @xmath42 was adjusted to maximize the signal . irradiating the detector by linear polarized light with unknown polarization angle @xmath42 yields two signals , @xmath144 and @xmath145",

    "our measurements demonstrate that all features of u2 in response to linear polarized radiation , such as spectral characteristic and time resolution , tolerance in angle of incidence and dynamic range are exactly the same as those in response to elliptically polarized radiation described above .",
    "this is because in both cases the basic mechanism of response is the lpge as given by the first term of the right hand side in eq .",

    "the method has also been successfully applied to monitor the ellipticity of cw thz laser radiation by reducing the bandwidth of detection .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the sensitivity can be improved essentially by using a larger number of qws . further increase of sensitivity can be obtained by applying narrow band materials such as hgte qws .",
    "most recently we observed in hgte qws cpge signals more than one order of magnitude larger than that of the gaas qws investigated here  @xcite .",
    "another way to improve sensitivity might be the application of specially designed lateral structured qws with enhanced asymmetry .",
    "besides other applications , sensitive thz detectors of the type shown here can be of particular interest for the control of current density profiles in plasmas which is important for tokamak operation@xcite .",
    "we also note that the cpge and lpge are also observed at valence - to - conduction band transitions  @xcite , at direct intersubband transitions  @xcite , and in wide - band gan semiconductor heterojunctions  @xcite .",
