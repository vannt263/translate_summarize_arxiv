    "the dawsons integral is defined by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a complex argument .",
    "this integral is closely related to the complex error function , also known as the faddeeva function @xcite @xmath6 in particular , comparing equations and we can easily find a relation between the dawsons integral and the complex error function @xmath7.\\ ] ] as we can see from this identity , the dawsons integral is simply a reformulation of the complex error function .",
    "the dawsons integral can not be taken analytically in terms of elementary functions in a closed form and , therefore , it must be solved numerically .",
    "several useful approximations for the dawsons integral have been reported @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show a new approach that can be successfully implemented for efficient computation .",
    "the complex error function can be alternatively represented as ( see appendix a ) @xmath8 and expressed as a sum @xcite @xmath9 where its real and imaginary parts are ( see appendix b ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . the equation is known as the voigt function @xcite , widely used in many branches of applied mathematics @xcite , physics @xcite and astronomy @xcite .",
    "since the function has no a specific name , it can be regarded as the @xmath12-function .    due to symmetric properties of the voigt function",
    "@xmath13 it is sufficient to consider only the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quadrants in order to cover the entire complex plane .",
    "therefore , we will imply further that @xmath16 .",
    "in our recent publication @xcite we have shown that a new sampling methodology based on incomplete expansion of the sinc function @xcite leads to a rational approximation of the voigt function for rapid and accurate computation ( see also the matlab source code in @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( for higher accuracy the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be taken as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) .",
    "this rational approximation is faster than the weidemans rational approximation @xcite by factor greater than two ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "furthermore , with the same number of summation terms it is by several orders of the magnitude more accurate than the weidemans rational approximation in the domain of practical interest @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite required for applications using the hitran molecular spectroscopic database @xcite . in general ,",
    "the series approximation provides accurate results while @xmath31 .",
    "however , its accuracy deteriorates with decreasing parameter @xmath32 and , consequently , it can not cover a narrow band region @xmath33 along @xmath34-axis .",
    "it should be noted that the accuracy deterioration of the voigt function at small @xmath0 is a very common problem in most known approximations ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "although the computation of the voigt function at @xmath33 is required relatively rare in practice , it , nevertheless , has to be taken into account in algorithmic implementation . in this work",
    "we propose a rational approximation for the dawsons integral of real argument and show how its implementation can resolve effectively such a problem in computation of the voigt function that occurs at small @xmath0 .",
    "as we have shown recently , the exponential function can be expanded as a series @xcite @xmath35},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 this equation has been used to obtain the rational approximation @xcite .",
    "we may also utilize it for the @xmath12-function by substituting the exponential function approximation into equation .",
    "this leads to the following integral @xmath39 } } \\,dt .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrand of this integral is analytic everywhere over the entire complex plane except @xmath40 isolated points @xmath41 where we can observe the singularities .",
    "in order to integrate equation ( 9 ) , we may choose conveniently a contour @xmath42 in counterclockwise ( ccw ) direction on the upper - half complex plane as a semicircle centered at the origin with infinite radius . consequently , since the domain enclosed by contour @xmath42 covers only the half of complex plane , the number of the isolated points is reduced twice @xmath43 using the residue theorems formula now @xmath44},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the integrand of integral , we obtain a rational approximation for the @xmath12-function as follows @xmath46}}{{\\beta _ m^2 + 2{\\beta _ m}\\left ( { { y^2 } - { x^2 } } \\right ) + { { \\left ( { { x^2 } + { y^2 } } \\right)}^2 } } } } \\\\   & \\rightarrow l\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) \\approx \\lambda \\left ( { x , y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the complex error function can be calculated as @xmath47    the computational testing we performed with equation shows that its imaginary part @xmath48 remains always accurate regardless how small the parameter @xmath32 is taken .",
    "therefore the computation of the voigt function at small @xmath0 is our main objective .",
    "we may attempt to resolve this problem by using the following approximation that has been reported in our recent work @xcite @xmath49,\\ ] ] where the dawsons integral of real argument is denoted as @xmath50 . taking the real part of the equation above",
    "yields the approximation of the voigt function @xmath51,\\ ] ] where we imply that the sinc function satisfies @xmath52    according to equation the dawsons integral of complex argument can be written now as @xmath53 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] and since at @xmath54 ( see appendix b ) , from equation above we get an approximation for the dawsons integral of real argument @xmath55",
    "lastly , using the series approximation the equation can be expressed as given by @xmath56}}{{\\beta _ m^2 + 2{\\beta _ m}\\left ( { { \\varsigma ^2}/4 - { x^2 } } \\right ) + { { \\left ( { { x^2 } + { \\varsigma ^2}/4 } \\right)}^2}}}}.\\ ] ]    figure 1 shows the difference @xmath57 between the original dawsons integral of real argument and its rational approximation . as we can see from this figure , despite only @xmath58 summation terms involved in the series approximation , the difference @xmath57 remains within a narrow range @xmath59 .",
    "this confirms a rapid convergence of equation that makes it suitable for practical applications .",
    "therefore , we can use it effectively as a supplement for computation of the voigt function at small @xmath0 .        since at @xmath0 the following functions can be approximated as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the equation",
    "is significantly simplified as follows @xmath64\\ ] ] and according to equation it can also be represented in form @xmath65.\\ ] ]    the computational time of the approximation is mostly taken by @xmath66-function . since the approximations and are about equally rapid , the approximation is also as fast as the approximation .",
    "thus , we can see that implementation of the dawsons function of the real argument does not decelerate the computation of the voigt function at small @xmath0 .      when the input parameters @xmath34 and @xmath32 are large enough , say if the condition @xmath67 is satisfied , many rational approximations become effective for computation .",
    "for example , the gauss ",
    "hermite quadrature , the taylor expansion series @xcite or the laplace continued fraction @xcite can be used . therefore , despite that the rational approximations and can cover accurately the entire domain of practical interest @xmath29 and @xmath68 @xcite required for applications using the hitran molecular spectral database @xcite , we may restrict them only within the domain @xmath69 that is considered the most difficult for rapid and accurate computation .",
    "thus , the computation of the voigt function inside the domain @xmath69 can be implemented in accordance with the following scheme @xmath70 , \\hspace{5pt } \\left| { x + iy } \\right| \\le 15 \\cap 0 \\le y < { 10^ { - 6}}. \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ]      let us define the relative error as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the reference , to quantify the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "the highly accurate reference values can be generated , for example , by using the algorithm 680 @xcite , the algorithm 916 @xcite or a new algorithm descried in the recent work @xcite .",
    "figure 2 show the logarithm of the relative error @xmath73 for the voigt function inside the domain @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as we can see from this figure , despite that only @xmath58 summation terms involved in computation , the accuracy of approximation in this domain is better than @xmath1 .",
    "thus we can see that the approach based on implementation of the rational approximation for the dawsons integral of real argument is efficient and practical .",
    "a rational approximation for the dawsons integral of real argument is presented .",
    "it can be utilized as an efficient supplement for accurate computation of the voigt function at small @xmath0 . in particular , this approach enables computation with accuracy exceeding @xmath1 inside the domain @xmath2 and @xmath3 . due to rapid performance the algorithmic implementation of the rational approximation does not decelerate the computation of the voigt function .",
