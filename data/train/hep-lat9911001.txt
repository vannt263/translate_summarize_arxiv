    "hadronic properties are expected to change with increasing temperature , especially near to and above the qcd phase transition .",
    "forthcoming heavy ion collision experiments will give the opportunity to investigate them , and require theoretical studies of signals of the phase transition and the qgp formation .",
    "lattice qcd simulations allow us to perform model independent non - perturbative studies .",
    "so far most calculations of hadronic masses at finite temperature have handled only the screening mass @xcite but not the pole mass , which has a fundamental importance .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic ambiguity in defining pole masses at finite temperature the main difficulty comes from the shortness of the `` temporal '' ( temperature ) extension , @xmath1 .    here , we attack the problem by using optimised hadronic operators on anisotropic lattices .",
    "our strategy is as follows : + ( 1 ) to use anisotropic lattices to obtain a good resolution in the temporal direction .",
    "+ ( 2 ) to seek for a good operator which has a large overlap with the state of interest at zero temperature . + ( 3 ) to observe temperature dependent effects by using this optimised operator on finite temperature lattices .    in the following , we report results on light and heavy mesons .",
    "since part of the former have already been reported @xcite , we briefly summarise the current results . on the latter ,",
    "we describe our computation and preliminary results .",
    "we use lattices of @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , in the quenched approximation .",
    "calibration using wilson loops at @xmath7 gives the anisotropy @xmath8 and @xmath9 gev . our lattices correspond to temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .    for light quarks , anisotropic",
    "wilson fermions are employed .",
    "after coulomb gauge fixing , the ps meson is measured by the following operators ; @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a quark propagator and @xmath14 is @xmath15 , which we call `` exp - source '' here . after tuning the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the correlator at @xmath18 is dominated by the lowest state @xcite .",
    "then the correlators at finite temperature are measured : it turns out that the effective masses change significantly above @xmath19 , while @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) reveals almost the same features as @xmath18 .",
    "we also examine the spatial structure of the correlator above @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_func ] we compare the @xmath22  wave functions \" normalised at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , at several @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "also shown is the free quark case ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the _ exp - exp _ source appears somewhat too broad at @xmath30 : the quarks come close to each other while propagating in @xmath25 .",
    "an unexpected fact is that this is also the case at @xmath31 : the spatial distribution shrinks and stabilises , indicating that even at this high temperature there is tendency for quark and anti - quark to stay together .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the free quark case which never shows such a behaviour regardless of the source . the same feature holds for the other mesons at all quark masses .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows the temperature dependence of `` masses '' which are extracted from the `` exp - exp '' correlators at the three points @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "though the values above @xmath19 have large systematic errors , pole masses indicate chiral restoration there .",
    "we also show in the figure the screening masses : their difference with the pole masses is manifest .",
    "it is also noted that mesons degenerate approximately irrespective of their spin .",
    "[ fig : wave_func ]    [ fig : mass ]",
    "our target is mainly charmonium physics , e.g. investigations of the mass shift near @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath33 suppression in the plasma phase @xcite . in order to treat heavy quarks with the currently available computer power , we use the effective theory approach .",
    "we adopt fermilab action with @xmath34 improvement @xcite . on the anisotropic lattice ,",
    "the heavy quark operator is : @xmath35 where , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "mean - field improvement is done for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    introducing the anisotropy results in changing the free quark dispersion relation . in eq.([eq : clover_aniso2 ] ) , one notices that a larger anisotropy @xmath42 causes a smaller wilson term .",
    "then the problem is how the contribution from the momentum region at the edge of the brillouin zone becomes larger . in the heavy quarkonium , typical energy and momentum scales exchanged in the meson",
    "are of order @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively . for the charmonium , @xmath45 , and",
    "the typical energy scale is @xmath46 mev .",
    "let us consider our lattice : @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 , @xmath49 roughly corresponds to the charm quark mass . from the dispersion relation , @xmath50 gev .",
    "though this result seems not sufficient , the effect is expected to be small for the ground state . with increasing lattice cutoff",
    ", this problem becomes milder .",
    "we used the same configurations as for the light meson study .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath42 is fixed by using the dispersion relation . at present",
    "one set of parameters is available : @xmath51 and @xmath52 which corresponds to the vector meson mass @xmath53 gev .",
    "fig.[fig : heavy ] shows the effective masses of @xmath22 and @xmath54 mesons at finite temperature . as for light mesons , on the @xmath55 lattice the lowest vector and pseudoscalar states keep almost the same masses as at @xmath18 . above @xmath19",
    "we observe , as in the light meson case , that the v meson effective mass goes below the ps meson .",
    "however , the ps effective mass stays at almost the same position as at @xmath18 while the v effective mass decreases fast , in contrast to the light meson case where both of them increase with @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : heavy ]",
    "for a light quark system , the wave function indicates a strong correlation between quark and antiquark even above @xmath19 .",
    "the pole masses show chiral restoration above @xmath19 and a behaviour quite different from that of the screening masses . for heavy quark systems we use the fermilab action on an anisotropic lattice .",
    "the effective mass of the vector meson drops sharply above @xmath19 .",
    "further investigations with finer lattices are undergoing .",
