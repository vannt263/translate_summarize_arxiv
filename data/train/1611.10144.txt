    "the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is expected to have a rich phase structure at finite chemical potential and temperature @xcite .",
    "its study is a central topic of high energy nuclear physics .",
    "experimental programs at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are currently investigating the properties of hot and dense qcd matter . future programs at rhic , the facility for anti - proton and ion research ( fair ) and the nica facility are aimed at a better understanding of the phase transition from hadronic to de - confined quark matter and the transition from a phase where chiral symmetry is broken to one where it is restored .",
    "+ theoretical studies employing lattice qcd methods have already established that the transition from hadrons to quarks proceeds as a smooth crossover in the case of vanishing net baryon number density @xcite . for finite net baryon density ,",
    "the use of standard lattice qcd methods is limited by the so - called fermion sign problem .",
    "some conclusions can be drawn by extending the lattice thermodynamic quantities , via a taylor expansion around @xmath0 @xcite , for values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , to go to even higher densities , higher orders of the expansion coefficients need to be known to a very good accuracy , a requirement which can not be met with the current computational possibilities .",
    "thus , the current conclusions are that , a first order phase transition seems very unlikely for chemical potentials smaller than @xmath2 ( i.e. , for @xmath3 mev )",
    ". + at very large net baryon densities and low temperatures , astrophysical observations may also help to constrain the qcd equation of state .",
    "nuclear matter ground - state properties have been derived from measurements to a high accuracy . on the other hand , properties of compact stars like their masses and",
    "eventually , their radii , can serve as important information for determining the equation of state at several times nuclear ground - state density ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ with the currently available information , we can theorise that , in the temperature ( @xmath4 ) and baryo - chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) plane , the conjectured qcd phase diagram consists , primarily , of three parts :    1 .   a high @xmath5 and temperature region , where chiral symmetry is restored , containing a de - confined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , 2 .   a low temperature and moderate @xmath5 region containing dense , strongly interacting nuclear matter and nuclei , and 3 .   a low temperature and low chemical potential region made up of purely hadronic matter described by a hadron resonance gas .",
    "the transition from a phase where chiral symmetry is broken to one where it is restored , for lower temperatures , is conjectured to be a first - order phase transition , which switches to a continuous transition at a point known as the critical point ( @xmath6 ) . at values of @xmath5",
    "lower than that at @xmath6 , the transition is termed a crossover transition. the transition from a dilute gas of hadrons to bound nuclear matter is also a first - order phase transition , generally called the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "+ in order to verify this suggested phase structure experimentally , heavy - ion collision experiments are conducted at various beam energies .",
    "some particularly interesting observables in these experiments are the moments of the multiplicity distributions , the susceptibilities of the different conserved net charges ( baryon number , strangeness and electric charge ) @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this interest is that , one proposed universal characteristic of the critical point of qcd is the divergence of the correlation length , @xmath7 , of the order - parameter ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) fields . as a consequence , higher - order fluctuation moments of observables coupled to these fields also diverge , at least for an infinite system size and relaxation time @xcite .",
    "+ the direct comparison of these measured susceptibilities with lattice qcd results is neither straightforward , nor entirely unambiguous .",
    "currently known complications in the interpretation of such measurements include : corrections of experimental efficiency and acceptance effects @xcite , cluster formation @xcite , conservation laws @xcite , corrections due to the finite size of the system @xcite , fluctuations of the system volume@xcite and fluctuations present in the initial state of the collision @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out that , the hadronic decoupling phase , which occurs after hadronisation , can have a strong influence on the observed multiplicity distributions @xcite .",
    "+ on the theoretical side , the measured susceptibilities , at least for large values of the chemical potential , are usually compared to effective models , which normally do not include a de - confinement or chiral transition and a nuclear liquid - gas transition simultaneously .",
    "+   + in this paper , we will discuss how the observed susceptibilities may change if one takes into account an equation of state that includes a nuclear liquid - gas transition , as well as a first order chiral transition at high baryon densities .",
    "we will also show , how the observed susceptibilities change with beam energy for different freeze - out lines in the phase diagram and how the interplay between the liquid - gas transition and the chiral transition manifests itself in the beam - energy dependence .",
    "the parity - doublet model , as used in this paper , serves as an effective approach to describe the strongly interacting hadronic , and in extension , quark matter . in this approach ,",
    "an explicit mass term for baryons in the lagrangian is possible , which preserves chiral symmetry . here , the signature for chiral symmetry restoration is the degeneracy of the usual baryons and their respective negative - parity partner states . in the following ,",
    "we outline the basic su(3 ) parity model and determine nuclear matter saturation properties with this ansatz .",
    "subsequently , we calculate the phase diagram of isospin - symmetric matter by varying the baryo - chemical potential and temperature of the system . +   + in the model approach , positive and negative parity states of the baryons are grouped in doublets @xmath10 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the flavour su(3 ) extension of the approach , using the non - linear representation of the fields , is quite straightforward , as shown in @xcite and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , as outlined in @xcite , one constructs su(3)-invariant terms in the lagrangian including the meson - baryon and meson - meson self - interaction terms .    taking into account the scalar and vector condensates in mean - field approximation , the resulting lagrangian @xmath11 reads as @xcite @xmath12 summing over the states of the baryon octet .",

    "in addition , there is an su(3 ) symmetry - breaking mass term proportional to the strangeness , @xmath15 , of the respective baryon .",
    "note that , the parity - doublet models allow for two different scalar coupling terms @xmath16 . +   +",
    "the scalar meson interaction , driving the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , can be written in terms of su(3 ) invariants @xmath17 and @xmath18 as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is fixed by demanding a vanishing potential in the vacuum .",
    "+ in this work , the last term , @xmath21 , has been introduced following ref .",
    "@xcite , which results in an improved lowering of the calculated nuclear matter compressibility value to 267 mev , which is now in reasonable agreement with the phenomenologically obtained range of about @xmath22 mev .",
    "the set of scalar coupling constants are fitted in order to reproduce the vacuum masses of the nucleon , and the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 hyperons , whereas the vector couplings are chosen to reproduce reasonable values for nuclear ground - state properties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . + as likely parity partner of the nucleon we choose the n(1535 ) resonance with its correspondent mass . in order to keep the number of parameters small , we assume equal mass splitting of the baryons with their respective parity partners , therefore setting @xmath26 .",
    "an su(3 ) description , in addition to enhancing the number of degrees of freedom , also necessarily increases the number of parameters . in order to avoid being overwhelmed by too many new parameters ,",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the splitting of the various baryon species and their respective parity partners is of the same value for all baryons , which is achieved by setting @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "+ the hyperonic vector interactions were tuned to generate phenomenologically acceptable optical potentials of the hyperons in ground - state nuclear matter , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the mass difference due to the strange quark was fixed at @xmath30 mev .",
    "all parameter values used are summarized in table [ modpar ] .",
    ".model parameters : the f , d , and s - type couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the couplings of the various baryons . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      at some temperature , qcd exhibits a transition from a hadronic to a de - confined phase , at which point , the quarks become the dominant degrees of freedom .",
    "this transition occurs as a smooth crossover , at least for @xmath34 .",
    "consequently there has been discussion about the actual temperature up to which a hadronic description is still valid @xcite .",
    "we can only say for sure that the order parameter of the chiral transition , the chiral condensate , has an inflection point at the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath35 mev , and that de - confinement occurs in a temperature region of @xmath36 mev .",
    "nevertheless , at some point , the hadronic parity - doublet model will not be the appropriate effective description of qcd and one needs to introduce a de - confinement mechanism in the model . in this work",
    ", we will apply a mechanism that has been introduced in @xcite , to add a de - confinement transition in a chiral hadronic model .",
    "this is done by adding an effective quark and gluon contribution , as done in the pnjl approach @xcite .",
    "this model uses the polyakov loop @xmath37 as the order parameter for de - confinement .",
    "@xmath37 is defined via @xmath38 , \\label{phidef}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the temporal component of the su(3 ) gauge field , distinguishing @xmath37 and its conjugate @xmath40 , at finite baryon densities @xcite .",
    "+ the effective masses of the quarks are generated by the scalar mesons , except for a small explicit mass term ( @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev , for the strange quark ) and @xmath43 : @xmath44 with values of @xmath45 .",
    "similar to the case of the baryons , we also introduced a mass parameter @xmath46 mev for the quarks .",
    "again , this additional mass term can be due to a coupling of the quarks to the dilaton field ( gluon condensate ) .",
    "given such a mass term , the quarks do not appear in the nuclear ground - state , which would be a clearly non - physical result .",
    "this also permits us to set the vector type repulsive interaction strength of the quarks , to zero .",
    "a non - zero vector interaction strength would lead to a massive deviation of the quark number susceptibilities from lattice data , as has been indicated in different mean field studies @xcite .",
    "+ a coupling of the quarks to the polyakov loop is introduced in the thermal energy of the quarks .",
    "their thermal contribution to the grand - canonical potential @xmath47 , can be written as : @xmath48 and @xmath49 the sums run over all quark flavours , where @xmath50 is the corresponding degeneracy factor , @xmath51 the energy and @xmath52 the chemical potential of the quark .",
    "+ all thermodynamic quantities : energy density @xmath53 , entropy density @xmath54 , as well as the densities of the different particle species @xmath55 , are derived from the grand - canonical potential .",

    "was proposed long ago @xcite . in recent publications @xcite",
    ", we adopted this ansatz to describe successfully a smooth transition from a hadronic to a quark dominated system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ in particular , we introduce the quantity @xmath65 , which is the volume excluded by a particle of species @xmath66 , where we only distinguish between baryons , mesons and quarks .",
    "consequently , @xmath65 can assume three values : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a number larger than one . in our calculations ,",
    "we choose a value of @xmath69 , which assumes that the radius @xmath70 of a meson is half of the radius of a baryon .",
    "note that , at this point , we neglect any possible density - dependent and lorentz contraction effects on the excluded volumes as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the modified chemical potential @xmath71 , which is connected to the real chemical potential @xmath72 of the @xmath66-th particle species , is obtained by the following relation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the sum over all partial pressures . to be thermodynamically consistent ,",
    "all densities ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) have to be multiplied by a volume correction factor @xmath78 , which is the ratio of the total volume @xmath79 and the reduced volume @xmath80 , not being occupied : @xmath81 @xmath82 as a consequence , the chemical potentials of the hadrons are decreased by the quarks , but not vice - versa . in other words ,",
    "as the quarks start appearing , they effectively suppress the hadrons by changing their chemical potential , while the quarks are only affected through the volume correction factor @xmath78 .",
    "a comparison with data obtained from lattice qcd calculations is necessary in order to benchmark the model results and their subsequent modifications . to that end",
    ", we determine the interaction measure @xmath83 , defined as : @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath4 as the energy density , pressure and temperature , respectively . the model result for @xmath83 at @xmath0 as function of temperature , in comparison to available lattice data @xcite ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ept ] .",
    "it is obvious that , though the shapes obtained from both sets of data are similar , the peak value of the interaction measure is much higher in case of the parity - doublet model than that obtained from lattice qcd .",
    "this is a result of the enhanced sharpness of the crossover region ( explained , in detail , in section [ suscsec ] ) , as defined by the model , w.r.t .",
    "lattice calculations .",
    "it is , however , interesting to observe that the peaks occur almost at the same temperature in both cases , thereby proving that the parity - doublet model is capable of providing a reasonable approximation of the properties of the system at a vanishing baryo - chemical potential i.e. , at @xmath86 .",
    "+   + checking model results for nuclear model ground - state properties , we obtain phenomenologically acceptable values of a nucleonic binding energy of 16.00 mev and a compressibility ( @xmath87 ) of 267.12 mev , for a saturation density @xmath88 .",
    "note that the compressibility , which in general tends to be very high in parity - doublet models , has a reasonable value ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some interesting characteristics of the system may be revealed by observing the pressure of the system , along the transition lines , as a function of temperature .",
    "the model results for the pressure along the transition and crossover lines , is shown in fig .",
    "[ pplot ] , where the baryo - chemical potential increases with decreasing temperature along both lines ( cf .",
    "[ crit ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the pressure along the transition line for the liquid - gas transition is as expected . since the baryon density along the liquid - gas transition does not change considerably with increasing temperature , the change in the pressure is driven , primarily , by the increase in the entropy caused by the increasing temperature .",
    "such a behaviour can be observed when the specific entropy in the gas phase is larger than that in the liquid phase , as derived from the clapeyron equation @xcite .    for the chiral transition ,",
    "the change of the pressure along the transition line is more complicated . at large temperatures and small chemical potentials",
    ", the pressure essentially follows the trend of the nuclear liquid - gas transition , as the meson - dominated system transitions smoothly into a system dominated by quark and gluons . as the chemical potential increases",
    ", however , the change in degrees of freedom is manifested more strongly in a change of net baryon number , as the system transitions from heavy baryons to light baryons .",
    "consequently , the change in net baryon number dominates the change of pressure and thus , the pressure along the transition line shows a behaviour opposite to that observed during the liquid - gas transition . as the transition line goes to even lower temperatures , the behaviour of the pressure changes direction again .",
    "this time , however , it is a result of the change in curvature of the transition line in the @xmath4-@xmath5 diagram ( cf .",
    "[ crit ] ) .",
    "this is , most likely , an artefact of the polyakov model , which is not very reliable at low values of temperature and large values of baryo - chemical potential . in any case",
    ", it is important to note that , the pressure at zero temperature for the de - confinement transition takes a finite value , which is an important property of a `` realistic '' model for the qcd eos .    in order to illustrate the change in degrees of freedom at the transition lines",
    ", one can determine the so - called quark fraction @xmath89 , defined as : @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 denoting the energy density contributions from the quarks , baryons ( including quarks ) , mesons and the polyakov loop contribution from the gluons , respectively .",
    "the variation in this quantity , as a function of temperature , is shown in fig .",
    "[ qfrac ] along both transition lines .    along the lg transition line ,",
    "the quark fraction is essentially zero for temperatures below 100 mev ( where the interplay between the two crossover transitions is negligible ) . above this value",
    "it gradually rises ( cf . fig .",
    "[ qfrac ] ) as the lg crossover line approaches the de - confinement crossover ( cf .",
    "[ crit ] ) , thereby introducing an increasing number of quarks in the system .",
    "+ for the chiral transition , the quark fraction starts to increase , quite sharply , at around 100 mev ( cf .",
    "[ qfrac ] ) .",
    "below that temperature , the transition is , apparently , a dominantly chiral one , with only a slow change in degrees of freedom . at very low temperatures ,",
    "however , a slow change in the quark fraction is observed once again .",
    "this is because , at these temperatures , quarks can be introduced into the system due to the large chemical potential and due to the quark - suppressing effect of the polyakov potential disappearing at low temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamics of qcd at small values of @xmath95 can be obtained by a taylor expansion of lattice results at @xmath86 , in terms of the baryo - chemical potential .",
    "expanding the pressure , @xmath96 where @xmath47 is the grand - canonical potential , @xmath79 the volume and @xmath97 the grand - canonical partition function , the corresponding expansion coefficients @xmath98 , or alternatively , the baryon number susceptibilities @xmath99 , result as : @xmath100 the behaviour of these coefficients - or susceptibilities - especially , the third - order @xmath101 ( skewness ) and fourth - order @xmath102 ( kurtosis ) , in and around the phase transitions , are expected to provide stronger signals of criticality , as compared to the second - order @xmath103 , because they diverge with a higher power of the correlation length of the order parameter , close to a second - order - type phase transition .",
    "+ in experiment , usually the normalized ratios @xmath104 and @xmath105 are extracted from data , in order to remove the volume dependence of the susceptibilities ( note : this does not remove their dependence on volume fluctuations ) . before calculating the susceptibilities",
    ", it is useful to clearly identify the crossover and first - order phase transition lines of the qcd phase diagram , within this model .",
    "a study of the discontinuities of the baryon density ( @xmath106 ) and the chiral condensate ( @xmath8 ) of the system , as a function of baryo - chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) and temperature ( @xmath4 ) , allows us to obtain the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values for the first - order and cross over phase transition curves .",
    "as the model is able to describe the nuclear matter ground - state , one thus obtains the liquid - gas phase transition curve as well as the ( first - order ) chiral phase transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ crit ] , with their respective critical end - points .",
    "both critical endpoints occur at a very low temperature .",
    "we also observe that the associated crossover lines , while first separated , merge at an intermediate chemical potential @xmath107 mev .",
    "the figure also shows lines of constant entropy per baryon ( isentropes ) for various values of entropy per baryon .",
    "the isentropes show a distinct structure , a bending over at the crossover , as the dominant degrees of freedom change from hadrons to quarks . at the junction of the liquid - gas and chiral crossover transitions",

    "( [ susc ] ) are numerically calculated using a five - point formula . for all temperatures ranging from 15 mev to 180 mev , and all baryo - chemical potential values from 0 mev to 1200 mev",
    ", the results with the previously discussed ratios of susceptibilities are shown in figures [ tt ] and [ tt2 ] .",
    "the figures illustrate the effect that the two phase transitions have on the susceptibility values .",
    "in the de - confinement phase the susceptibilities have values smaller than 1 , as expected for a gas of low - mass fermions . in the region below the lg phase transition ( at values of @xmath108 )",
    ", they are consistently close to 1 , since the system is composed of bound hadrons , where a value of 1 for the cumulants of conserved charges is expected . for the region between the crossover transitions from liquid ( bound hadrons ) to gas ( of hadron resonances ) and from a hadron resonant gas ( hrg ) to the qgp , an interplay between the two phase transitions can be observed .",
    "this results in the cumulants sometimes having values below 1 , or even below zero , and sometimes having values greater than 1 , in this intermittent region .    in order to give a rough estimate of the susceptibility ratios that could be expected from experiment , one has to define the point in the phase diagram at which the fluctuations are , essentially , frozen out .",
    "this point will be different for each beam energy and system size , and in general , is not trivially defined .",

    "we have presented an improved version of the hadronic , three - flavour , parity - doublet model including a de - confinement transition to quarks and gluons .",
    "the main modification is the inclusion of a six - point interaction term , which significantly improves the nuclear matter saturation properties of the model . with this , we have constructed a model which gives a satisfactory description of nuclear matter , as well as lattice qcd thermodynamics at @xmath119 .",

    "<S> we use an improved version of the su(3 ) flavour parity - doublet quark - hadron model to investigate the higher order baryon number susceptibilities near the chiral and the nuclear liquid - gas transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the parity - doublet model has been improved by adding higher - order interaction terms of the scalar fields in the effective mean field lagrangian , resulting in a much - improved description of nuclear ground - state properties , in particular the nuclear compressibility . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram of the model agrees qualitatively with expectations from lattice qcd , i.e. , it shows a crossover at zero net baryo - chemical potential and a critical point at finite density . using this model , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dependence of the higher - order baryon number susceptibilities as function of temperature and chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a string interplay between the chiral and liquid - gas transition at intermediate baryo chemical potentials . due to this interplay between the chiral and the nuclear liquid - gas transitions , </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally measured cumulants of the net baryon number may show very different beam energy dependence , subject to the actual freeze - out temperature . </S>"
