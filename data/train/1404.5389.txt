    "properties of heavy - flavored hadrons such as masses and decay widths can , in principle , be described in the theoretical framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , they are difficult to calculate in practice with the perturbative qcd technique due to the fact that the strong coupling constant @xmath11 is large in this low energy regime . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "other methods such as lattice qcd @xcite , heavy quark effective theory @xcite , quark model @xcite , qcd sum rule @xcite , and bag model @xcite are deployed .",
    "the properties of the @xmath12 baryons have been measured by many experiments @xcite , but the total uncertainties of the world averages remain large @xcite . for example , the relative uncertainties of the decay widths are around 10% of their central values .",
    "furthermore , the relative uncertainty of the mass splitting @xmath13 is about 40% , and there is no significant measurement for the mass splitting @xmath14 @xcite . due to the mass hierarchy between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks , one may expect that the @xmath17 @xmath18 baryon is heavier than the @xmath19 @xmath20 baryon ; however , many experimental results contradict this naive expectation @xcite .",
    "to explain the discrepancy , various models have been introduced @xcite that predict positive mass splittings .",
    "precise measurements of the mass splittings are necessary to test these models .    in this paper , we present precise measurements of the masses and decay widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons , and of their mass splittings . throughout this paper ,",
    "the charge - conjugate decay modes are implied .",
    "this study uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb@xmath2 collected with the belle detector at the kekb @xmath3 asymmetric - energy collider @xcite operating at the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the belle detector is a large solid angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprising csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath21 mesons and to identify muons",
    ". a detailed description of the belle detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 baryons are reconstructed via their @xmath22 decays , where @xmath23 is a low - momentum ( `` slow '' ) pion .",
    "charged tracks are required to have an impact parameter with respect to the interaction point of less than 3 cm along the beam direction ( the @xmath24 axis ) and less than 1 cm in the plane transverse to the beam direction .",
    "in addition , each track is required to have at least two associated vertex detector hits each in the @xmath24 and azimuthal strips of the svd .",
    "the particles are identified using likelihood @xcite criteria that have efficiencies of 84% , 91% , 93% , and 99% for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 candidates are reconstructed as combinations of @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 candidates with an invariant mass between 2278.07 and 2295.27 mev/@xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath30 around the nominal @xmath5 mass , where @xmath31 represents the @xmath5 invariant mass resolution .",
    "@xmath5 daughter tracks are refit assuming they originate from a common vertex .",
    "the @xmath5 production vertex is defined by the intersection of its trajectory with the @xmath3 interaction region .",
    "@xmath5 candidates are combined with @xmath23 candidates to form @xmath12 candidates .",
    "@xmath23 candidates are required to originate from the @xmath5 production vertex in order to improve their momentum resolution , which results in an enhanced signal - to - background ratio .",
    "signal candidates retained for further analysis are required to have a confidence level greater than 0.1% for the @xmath23 vertex fit constrained to the @xmath5 production vertex . to suppress combinatorial backgrounds",
    ", we also require the momentum of @xmath12 baryons in the center - of - mass frame to be greater than 2.0 gev/@xmath32 .",
    "the distributions of the mass difference @xmath33 for all reconstructed @xmath12 candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feeddown ] .",
    "we also use a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation sample for various purposes in this study , where events are generated with pythia @xcite , decays of unstable particles are modeled with evtgen @xcite , and the detector response is simulated with geant3 @xcite .",
    "the sample of selected @xmath12 candidates includes two types of backgrounds : partially reconstructed decays of excited @xmath5 baryons ( referred to as `` feed - down backgrounds '' ) and random combinations of the final state particles .",
    "the procedures used to parameterize these backgrounds are described in this section .      from the tracks of a @xmath35 decay ,",
    "a @xmath36 candidate can be reconstructed if one of the slow pions is left out .",
    "this can be either a signal ( from a @xmath12 resonant decay of an excited @xmath5 state ) or a feed - down background event .",
    "the feed - down backgrounds from the @xmath37 and @xmath38 states appear in the @xmath0 mass region . in order to remove these backgrounds , we tag events that have a mass difference @xmath39 ( @xmath40 being a charged track ) that falls either in the [ 302 , 312 ] mev/@xmath9 or the [ 336 , 347 ] mev/@xmath9 mass interval , corresponding to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 signals , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : excitedlambdac ] ) .",
    "the tagged events are subtracted from the @xmath41 distributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feeddown ] . to prevent a possible bias in the subtraction",
    ", we estimate the backgrounds under the @xmath42 peaks from mc simulations and subtract them from the tagged feed - down backgrounds .",
    "furthermore , we take into account the charged track detection efficiency of 74% on average to correct for the feed - down backgrounds .",
    "since the shape of the feed - down backgrounds depends on the @xmath23 momentum , we obtain and apply the efficiency correction as a function of this quantity .",

    "the remaining background consists of random combinations , with or without a true @xmath5 baryon . in the latter case ,",

    "the treatment of the random backgrounds in the fit is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fitprocedure ] .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals , namely the decay widths and the mass differences with respect to the @xmath5 mass , are determined by performing binned maximum likelihood fits . due to the small fraction of the weighted events in the region where the feed - down background is subtracted , a correction to the covariance matrix of the fit parameters is applied to obtain the proper errors",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons are described by a relativistic breit - wigner probability density function ( pdf ) convolved with the detector response function as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a relativistic breit - wigner with the nominal mass difference @xmath48 and the decay width @xmath49 as fit parameters , and @xmath50 is the detector response function .",
    "the resolution function @xmath50 is parameterized as the sum of three gaussian functions centered at zero .",
    "the parameters are obtained from an mc simulation separately for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 signals . the detector resolutions for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 baryons",
    "are found to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 mev/@xmath9 , respectively , from the weighted variances of the three gaussian distributions where the errors are statistical .",
    "the random backgrounds without true @xmath5 baryons are modeled as histogram pdfs with shape and normalization taken from the @xmath5 baryon data sidebands .",
    "the random backgrounds with true @xmath5 baryons are described with a threshold function : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are fit parameters and @xmath58 is the known charged pion mass @xcite .    in the neutral channel , we find a small peak near @xmath59 mev/@xmath9 .",
    "based on studies performed using mc and data samples , we confirm the origin of this peak to be the as - of - yet unobserved decay of @xmath60 .",
    "we describe this peak with a gaussian function .",
    "the mean and width of the gaussian from the fit are found to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev/@xmath9 , respectively ; the former is consistent with that from the world average ( @xmath63 mev/@xmath9 ) @xcite and the latter is consistent with that from mc .",

    "these are summarized in table [ table : systematics ] .",
    "mass measurements are sensitive to the momentum scale of the detector . because there is a possible bias in the measurements of the charged track momenta , which may be due to the energy loss of the charged particles in materials",
    ", one should consider the precision of the momentum calibration . to minimize the possible bias",
    ", we calibrate the momentum scale using the copious @xmath66 sample .",

    "the obtained corrections are applied to the data sets used in this study . to estimate the accuracy , we choose a control sample of @xmath68 decay , and compare the mass difference of @xmath69 over the @xmath23 momentum bins with the world average @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "the world average with its total uncertainty @xcite is also shown as a hatched area . ]      since our detector resolution model is evaluated from the mc as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fitprocedure ] , the discrepancy between the mc and data is considered as a source of systematic uncertainty . to estimate the discrepancy",
    ", we compare the detector resolution in data and mc using the same control sample of @xmath68 decay .",
    "since the decay width of the @xmath70 meson is small , one can assume that the distribution of the mass difference @xmath69 is dominated by the detector resolution .",
    "we vary the widths of the detector response functions from + 1.7% to + 11.8% in the fits to @xmath41 by choosing the largest and smallest differences between the mc and data obtained by comparing @xmath69 as a function of the @xmath23 momentum .",
    "the uncertainties are found to be 0.19 , 0.25 , and 0.24 mev/@xmath9 for the widths of the @xmath0 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 baryons , respectively .",
    "we also vary the detector response functions by @xmath73 deviation from the fitted resolution parameters , where @xmath31 is the statistical error , and only small uncertainties are found for the decay widths of 0.01 and 0.04 mev/@xmath9 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons , respectively .",
    "we also check the internal consistency of the fitting procedure . in order to probe any bias from the fitter ,",
    "we perform 10,000 pseudo - experiments for each of the mass differences , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the decay widths @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the production of the pseudo - experiments , we set the input values to be those obtained from the data . from the study",

    "we also calculate the mass splittings @xmath84 from @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 mev/@xmath9 and @xmath88 mev/@xmath9 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic . since the mass splittings are calculated from @xmath78 , most of the systematic uncertainties cancel , such as that from the momentum calibration .",
