    "the possibility to found exotic mesons has been motivated many theoretical and experimental effort to understand the structure of the new mesons .",
    "the new mesons are called exotic , because they can not be explained in terms of quark - antiquark picture . since 2003 , there are many candidates for exotic mesons called @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , they have been discovered in @xmath8 mesons decays @xcite . the nature of the new mesons are completely open and there are already many theoretical interpretations about their structure .",
    "one of these interpretations is that their structure is a bound state of two other mesons .",
    "it is analogous to a proton and a neutron binding together to form a deuteron .",
    "this idea is not new and it was first studied by trnqvist in 1991 @xcite and he called these states a deuson .    in a second paper in 1994 ,",
    "trnqvist @xcite used a meson potential model with one - pion - exchange interactions for to study charm meson molecules with isospin i = 0 : @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but he did nt found any @xmath11 signal , on the other hand , zhang and huang @xcite calculated in qcd sum rules many molecular states , among them , @xmath11 , but it is not clear its isospin and g - parity @xmath12 in them sum rules .",
    "the @xmath11 state has already predicted by gamermann _",
    "et al._. @xcite in 2007 .",
    "they used the unitarization , in couple channels , of the chiral perturbation amplitudes and this state was called x(3700 ) and it has @xmath13=0 . in recent paper , gamermann _",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that it is possible to observe x(3700 ) in radiative decay , @xmath14 into x(3700)+@xmath15 .    in 1974 , walecka @xcite constructed an effective lagrangian composed of a baryon field and two mediated mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 to describe nucleon dynamics within highly condensed objects such a nucleus or neutron stars .",
    "the central idea of this model is the mean field theory ( mft ) , whereby we replace the meson field operators with their expectation values .",
    "the resulting equation of state for the system where the number of protons is equal the number of neutrons , called nuclear matter , exhibits nuclear saturation , where the two coupling constants in this theory are matched with binding energy and density of nuclear matter .",
    "a prediction of this theory at zero temperature t=0 is the neutron matter is unbound .",
    "although this theory is trustful for large number mass , these results can be interpreted as consequence of there is a only possible configuration for two body n - n bound state can be organized , the neutron - proton system or deuteron .",
    "another prediction of this theory at t=0 is that the nuclear matter is a liquid and the increasing of temperature it has a liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "the critical point has been measured by several experiments @xcite and this value is t=@xmath16 mev .    for the pion matter , this situation is opposite case that of nuclear matter .",
    "shuryak @xcite predicted that this system at finite temperature is a liquid .",
    "@xcite have been proposed that the equation of state of pion matter gives a phase transition gas - liquid at t<136 mev .",
    "more recently , anchishkin and nazarenko @xcite used mean field theory and predicted that the temperature of the phase transition gas - liquid is t=43 mev and the coupling constant was extracted for using the data of @xmath17 invariant mass spectrum .    in this work",
    ", we apply the walecka s mean field theory to study the @xmath0 matter .",
    "we focus our attention on the existence of @xmath0 bound state or x(3700 ) .",
    "we consider that if this bound state exists , then this matter should has a phase transition gas - liquid .",
    "recently , ding @xcite studied the meson - meson system , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , by using a procedure for converting a @xmath20-matrix into an effective potential , where the strong interactions are generated by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 meson exchange in the framework of the su(4 ) chiral invariant effective lagrangian . in this work ,",
    "we use the lagragians derived by ding @xcite for the interactions @xmath23 and @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where the field tensor is defined by @xmath26 , @xmath27 field is a doublet @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the masses of the @xmath27 meson , @xmath1 meson and @xmath2 meson . the coupling constants of this theory are : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . applying the lorentz gauge @xmath34 ,",
    "the equations of motion were obtained from eq.([model ] ) are : @xmath35 @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the equations eq.([em1 ] ) and eq.([em2 ] ) are field equations with massive quanta and @xmath27 meson currents as source .",
    "the equation eq.([em3 ] ) is a klein - gordon equation for the @xmath27 field with the meson fields @xmath2 and @xmath1 included in a minimal substitution .",
    "this situation is analogous to walecka s study of nuclear matter @xcite , where walecka s baryon field is now represented by @xmath27 meson field .",
    "considering walecka s mean field theory @xcite for a uniform and static system of @xmath27 mesons where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson fields can be replaced by classical fields .",
    "thus , the equations eq.([em1 ] ) , eq.([em2 ] ) and eq.([em3 ] ) reduce to : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where the scalar density is @xmath43 and the vector density is @xmath44\\rangle$ ] .",

    "we use a procedure @xcite to solve the self consistent equation eq.([self ] ) by a method to find the roots of the function @xmath71 , @xmath72    numerically , we get the behavior of sigma field with the temperature . inserting the sigma field in a effective mass equation , @xmath73 we get the mass of the d meson in hadronic medium fig.([massef ] ) .",
