    "young stars with accretion disks display energetic jets observed in optical transitions from low stages of ionization : [ o i ] , [ fe ii ] , [ s ii ] , [ n i ] , [ n ii ] , as well as molecular outflows . the source of these outflows is not well determined .",
    "shu et al .  ( 1994 ) argue they arise from the truncation region of the accretion disk where the stellar magnetosphere , frozen into the disk , causes super - keplerian rotation and drives a magnetocentrifugally accelerated wind .",
    "knigl & pudritz ( 2000 ) suggest an extended region of the accretion disk itself may be responsible . or , several regions may contribute to a cool wind as indicated by [ fe  ii ] : the disk forming a wide angle low velocity component , whereas a high velocity component is launched from a region next to the truncation radius ( pyo et al .",

    "it is important to determine physical properties of these winds and identify their source for they can affect angular momentum loss , disk structure , and acceleration of optical jets .",
    "additional unique spectral features can provide diagnostics of the dynamics of outflows from young stars and are reported here .",
    "two transitions are particularly valuable : the chromospheric he i ( @xmath010830 ; @xmath7 ) line arising from a metastable state predominantly populated by recombination following photoionization by the euv continuum . in a cool luminous star , this transition is generally formed higher in the atmosphere ( t@xmath120000k ) than h@xmath8  and the ca  ii and mg  ii emission cores ( dupree et al .",

    ". judged by atomic physics , the opacity of @xmath0977 exceeds all other major far - uv resonance lines by factors of 3 to 10 ( dupree et al .  2005 ) , making it sensitive to absorption that could reveal the presence of a wind . in a collisionally ionized plasma signals temperatures @xmath1 80,000k ( young et al .",
    "effects of mass motions causing asymmetries in ultraviolet line profiles are widely observed in luminous cool stars ( dupree & brickhouse 1998 , carpenter et al .  1999 ,",

    "two well - studied classical t tauri stars are good targets .",

    "the accretion disks are observed face - on . although the dipole component of the stellar magnetic field , where disk material is thought to be channeled to the star and thermalized in an accretion shock ( hartmann 1998 and references therein ) may not be aligned with the rotation axis of the star , it is still in view .",
    "tw hya is older ( 10 myr ) , than t tau , and the accretion rate may be low [ @xmath14@xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 , from h-@xmath8 , ( muzerolle et al .",

    "yr@xmath13 ) where @xmath27 is the fraction of the surface where the wind originates .",
    "similarly for , an acceleration to 300 km  s@xmath13 , over r@xmath23 suggests @xmath28/@xmath27 = 1.3 @xmath10 10@xmath3 ( @xmath26 yr@xmath13 ) , taking c / h=3.6@xmath10 10@xmath24 and a fractional ionization of 0.8 .",
    "a wind from high latitude regions might have @xmath29 .",
    "these values are less than the accretion rate inferred from h-@xmath8 , 4@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath26 yr@xmath13 ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , if wind optical depths are much larger , possibly 10@xmath30 ( hartmann 1998 ) , the mass loss rate becomes comparable to the accretion rate .",
    "the far uv spectrum of t tau is clearly of lesser quality than that of tw hya , but characteristics of the profiles are similar to tw hya : namely , a p cygni line extending to @xmath17220 km  s@xmath13 , a width less than , and profiles consistent with blue asymmetry . in t tau ,",
    "the far uv lines are narrower than the he i emission which , in a wind model , would suggest absorption with higher column density than in tw hya .",
    "it is difficult to determine the source of the uv line emission that provides the flux for wind scattering , but it must be close to the star .",
    "dwarf stars show strong emission from and ( redfield et al .",
    "2002 ) associated with activity , and we expect a similar contribution here . uv line fluxes generally increase in t tauri stars which are undergoing accretion , suggesting an origin in the accretion disk , x - region , or the shocked accretion column .",
    "the accretion disks in both sources contain h@xmath31 , are dusty , and thus are unlikely to create and support plasma at @xmath32  k. the intersection of the dipole magnetic field from the star and the accretion disk , perhaps the source of the x - wind , is also unlikely to be responsible as it is thought to be ionized and heated by x - rays only to temperatures of @xmath33k or less ( shang et al .",
    "part of the uv emission undoubtedly results from the accretion shock .",
    "profiles of emission from highly ionized ions in an accretion shock have not been reliably calculated ; the emission observeed might arise either from turbulent broadening associated with the shocked , cooling gas , or from infalling gas from the near - side accretion stream .",
    "non - thermal broadening could produce intrinsically symmetric profiles as modeled here .",
    "on the other hand , emission from the infalling gas on the far - side might be blocked by the star , producing an intrinsically asymmetric profile .",
    "the emission at @xmath17320 km  s@xmath13  in the line seems to rule out this second case , as we would expect similar features from , , and .",
    "furthermore , the star would preferentially block the highest velocities , not the lowest velocities , since the accretion stream accelerates toward the stellar surface .",
    "t  tauri stars are frequently associated with optical jets and herbig - haro ( hh ) objects . because our targets are face on , jets along the line of sight might contribute emission from high temperature material .",
    "however , high excitation hh objects that contain also exhibit a uv continuum ( bohm et al .",
    "1987 ) that is absent here .",
    "one of the brightest hh objects in the sky shows neither nor in a _",
    "hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ spectrum ( raymond et al .  1997 ) .",
    "fuse spectra of hh1 and hh2 obtained from the mast archive , also give no signs of these ions .",
    "thus it is not likely that hh objects contribute to the emission reported here .",
    "the emission components of and are exceptionally broad . both t tau and tw hya are slow rotators [ v  sin  @xmath34  = 20.9 and 5@xmath192 km  s@xmath13 , respectively ( hartmann et al .",
    "1986 ; alencar & batalha 2002 ) ] , yet the observed emission line widths exceed those values (: 102 km  s@xmath13  and 202 km  s@xmath13 ; : 140 km  s@xmath13  and 219 km  s@xmath13  respectively ) .",
    "accounting for absorption can nearly double the intrinsic widths .",
    "if the emission is attributed to active regions , the broadening would represent an extreme example of the weak broadening found in normal stars ( redfield et al .",
    "emission associated with the accretion flow and shock is likely to show turbulent broadening .",
    "we note that the uv line widths are significantly larger than the x - ray line widths . if the x - rays from tw hya are generated at the accretion shock ( kastner et al .",
    "2002 ) , the uv lines may not be directly associated with the shock . on the other hand , studies of x - ray emission in young star clusters ,",
    "suggest that the strength of the x - ray emission is correlated with stellar rotation , thus casting doubt on an accretion origin for the x - rays ( stassun et al.2004 ) .",
    "whatever the source of these collisionally excited photons , originating on or close to the star , they appear to be scattered in the outflowing plasma , producing a sequence of similar p cygni profiles ranging from and to . in our interpretation ,",
    "the wind signatures indicate a continuous outward acceleration from approximately the photospheric velocity to several hundred km  s@xmath13 , and reach temperatures of 3 @xmath1010@xmath20 k. a cool wind has been suggested in tw hya ( herczeg et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) as a component in the complex lyman-@xmath8 profile , and also from the weakness of one h@xmath31 line possibly affected by c ii absorption .",
    "other h@xmath31 transitions subject to wind absorption may offer insight into the configuration of the stellar wind if the site of the fluoresced h@xmath31 can be identified . a high temperature , fast wind might contribute to the opacity needed ( stassun et al .",
    "2004 ) for the absorption of x - rays in accreting systems .",
    "in addition , a fast hot wind may influence the diminution of dust in accretion disks ( alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "detailed semi - empirical modeling will be necessary to derive meaningful mass loss rates .",
    "the velocities observed in tw hya are larger than in t tau , although the wind may be less opaque , which is surprising if wind characteristics are related to the accretion rate .",
    "the profiles reported here are consistent with the presence of hot winds reaching escape velocities , that may lead to shocks and optical jets as the wind decelerates at greater distances from the star .",
    "the polar orientation of tw hya and t tau enabled full access to regions likely to contain open field lines enhancing mass outflow .",
    "observations of disk - star systems at various inclination angles can help to define the structure of both the emission region and the wind .",

    "<S> _   reveals that the classical t tauri star tw hydrae exhibits p cygni profiles , line asymmetries , and absorption indicative of a continuous , fast ( @xmath1400 km / s ) , hot ( @xmath1300,000 k ) accelerating outflow with a mass loss rate @xmath110@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 or larger . </S>",
    "<S> spectra of t tauri n appear consistent with such a wind . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the emission and outflow seems restricted to the stars themselves . </S>",
    "<S> although the mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude less for tw hya than for t tau , the outflow reaches higher velocities at chromospheric temperatures in tw hya . </S>",
    "<S> winds from young stellar objects may be substantially hotter and faster than previously thought . </S>"
