    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies provide a unique testing field for the theories of structure formation . due to their large velocity dispersions",
    "they are believed to be dominated by dark matter ( hereafter dm , for a review see mateo 1997 ) .",
    "because of their small masses they also lie in the regime of small accelerations , where , according to an alternative theory of milgrom ( 1983a ) , the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) may operate causing a similar increase of velocity dispersions .    until recently the measurements of velocity dispersion in dwarfs were restricted to a single value , the central velocity dispersion , on which all of the dynamical modelling was based . in order to estimate the mass - to - light ratio in such case a simplifying assumption of isotropic velocity distribution",
    "was usually made . using this approach many authors ( see mateo 1998 and references therein ) estimated mass - to - light ratios in dwarfs to be much larger than stellar values and interpreted this as a signature of the presence of dm . however , milgrom ( 1995 ) analysed the data concerning seven well known dsph galaxies and concluded that when mond is applied their mass - to - light ratios are consistent with stellar values if all the observational errors are properly taken into account .",
    "given the velocity dispersion data as a function of distance , which are becoming available now , we are able to extract much more information from the observations . our conclusions do not have to rely on the assumed velocity anisotropy model , but the best - fitting model can actually be found . on the theoretical side",
    "some progress has also been achieved . the dm distribution in haloes",
    "can now be reliably modelled using the results of @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explore the two hypotheses , based on dm and on mond , by calculating the predicted velocity dispersion profiles and comparing them to available data . in the case of dm",
    "our analysis is somewhat similar to an earlier study of pryor & kormendy ( 1990 ) who also considered two - component models involving stars and dm . in the case of mond ,",
    "our approach here is related to that of milgrom ( 1984 ) who applied the jeans equation to study density profiles of equilibrium systems with isotropic and isothermal velocity distributions .",
    "here we assume instead the observed density distribution of stars to obtain the velocity dispersions in mond for different velocity anisotropy models .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath5 of stars can be obtained by solving the jeans equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a 3d density of stars , @xmath8 is the gravitational acceleration associated with the potential @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a measure of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution .    in the absence of direct measurements of velocity anisotropy in dsph galaxies we have to consider different models for @xmath12 .",
    "our choice here is guided by the results of @xmath0-body simulations of dm haloes and observations of elliptical galaxies . for dm haloes thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that , in a variety of cosmological models , the ratio @xmath13 is not far from unity and decreases slowly with distance from the centre to reach @xmath14 at the virial radius . observations of elliptical galaxies are also consistent with the orbits being isotropic near the centre and somewhat radially anisotropic farther away , although cases with tangential anisotropy are also observed ( gerhard et al . 2001 ) .",
    "our fiducial anisotropy model will therefore be that of isotropic orbits : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . a more realistic approximation is provided by a model proposed by osipkov ( 1979 ) and merritt ( 1985 ) with @xmath12 dependent on distance from the centre of the object @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the anisotropy radius determining the transition from isotropic orbits inside to radial orbits outside .",
    "this model covers a wide range of possibilities from isotropic orbits ( @xmath19 ) to radial orbits ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "another possibility is that of tangential orbits with the fiducial case of circular orbits when @xmath21 . to cover intermediate cases between the isotropic and circular orbits",
    "we will consider a simple model of @xmath22const@xmath23 .",
    "the solution of the jeans equation ( [ m1 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath24 at @xmath25 for @xmath26 anisotropy is @xmath27 while for @xmath12=const we find @xmath28    from the observational point of view , an interesting , measurable quantity is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion obtained from the 3d velocity dispersion by integrating along the line of sight ( binney & mamon 1982 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the surface brightness . for circular orbits ,",
    "@xmath31 , and one has @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the circular velocity associated with the gravitational acceleration @xmath8 .    introducing results ( [ m4a ] ) or ( [ m4b ] ) into equation ( [ m3 ] ) and inverting the order of integration the calculations of @xmath34 can be reduced to one - dimensional numerical integration of a formula involving elementary functions in the case of @xmath26 ( see mamon & okas , in preparation ) and special functions for arbitrary @xmath22const .",
    "we will now discuss different factors entering in the calculations of @xmath35 , namely the density distribution of stars @xmath36 , the mass distributions contributed by stars and dm to gravitational acceleration @xmath37 and how this acceleration is changed in mond .",
    "the distribution of stars is well known in a number of dsph galaxies from surface brightness measurements and is usually well fitted by the exponential law or its generalization i.e. the srsic profile ( srsic 1968 , see also ciotti 1991 ) @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the central surface brightness and @xmath40 is the characteristic projected radius of the srsic profile .",
    "the srsic profile with parameter @xmath41 varying in the range @xmath42 has been found ( caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) to fit surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies in large mass range better than the standard de vaucouleurs law ( corresponding to @xmath43 ) . for dsph systems",
    "the fits are usually performed with @xmath44 , although is some cases other values of @xmath41 are found to provide better fits ( e.g. caldwell 1999 ) .",
    "the 3d luminosity density @xmath7 is obtained from @xmath30 by deprojection @xmath45 in the case of @xmath44 we get @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . for other values of @xmath41 in the range",

    "the three types of curves in each panel correspond to the three possibilities of the velocity dispersion profile being generated 1 ) by stars moving under newtonian gravitational acceleration generated by stars only ( dotted curves ) , 2 ) by stars moving under newtonian gravitational acceleration generated by stars and dm ( solid lines ) , 3 ) by stars moving under modified ( mondian ) acceleration generated by stars ( dashed lines ) .",

    "we have @xmath97 from equation ( [ m11 ] ) with @xmath98 .",
    "the three solid curves in each panel correspond from bottom to top to the virial masses of the dark halo @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "the three dashed lines show from bottom to top results obtained with different characteristic mond acceleration scales @xmath76 = 1 , 3 , 6 @xmath103 cm / s@xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fornax ] clearly shows that the stars alone can not reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile of fornax , unless the stellar mass - to - light ratio is much larger than assumed . in the following",
    "we will farther analyse the cases 2 ) and 3 ) trying to find the best - fitting models . comparing the predictions shown in figure  [ fornax ] with the data we find that a certain amount of tangential anisotropy is needed to reproduce the shape of the observed velocity dispersion profile .",
    "indeed , trying more radial anisotropy than in the case of isotropic orbits by using small values of @xmath18 ( comparable to @xmath40 or @xmath58 ) in ( [ m4a ] ) and ( [ m3 ] ) makes the curves in the upper panel of figure  [ fornax ] decrease even more steeply with distance , contrary to the trend observed in the data .",
    "therefore in what follows we adopt the velocity anisotropy model of @xmath22const@xmath104 and treat @xmath12 as a free parameter .    to find the best models we performed a two - parameter fitting for each case .",
    "the fitting parameters were @xmath105 for stars+dm case and @xmath106 for mond .",
    "the results of minimizing @xmath107 weighted by the variances of the data points are shown in figure  [ fornaxtw ] .",
    "it turns out that the dm model fits the data best for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this virial mass is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar mass ( @xmath110 for @xmath111 ) . in the case of mond",
    "the best - fitting parameters are @xmath112 and @xmath113 cm / s@xmath4 .",
    "this value of @xmath76 is consistent with other estimates ( milgrom 1983b ) .",
    "figure  [ mtl ] shows the combined mass - to - light ratio in v - band for fornax calculated from @xmath114 where @xmath96 and @xmath115 are given by equations ( [ m8 ] ) and ( [ m5d ] ) respectively , and @xmath116 is the luminosity distribution .",
    "the shape of the curve reflects the fact that dm dominates both at small and large distances .",
    "the divergence of @xmath117 at the centre of the galaxy is due to the fact that the luminosity density ( [ m5c ] ) increases towards the centre more slowly than the dm cusp of @xmath118 in ( [ m6 ] ) .",
    "the growth of @xmath117 at large distances is due to the behaviour of @xmath119 which diverges logarithmically while the mass in stars is finite .",
    "the minimum of @xmath120 appears at a scale of the order of the srsic radius and is consistent with the values of the central mass - to - light ratio estimated by mateo et al .",
    "we have found that the predictions based on mond with @xmath3 cm / s@xmath4 fit the fornax data equally well as models based on dm with virial mass of @xmath109 . in both cases a certain amount of tangential anisotropy is needed to reproduce the shape of the observed velocity dispersion profile .",
    "it turned out that the mond predictions in the case of fornax dwarf need less tangential anisotropy than dm predictions to reproduce the shape of the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "it remains to be checked how the dm predictions depend on the particular shape of dm distribution .",
    "the particular fitted values of @xmath76 and @xmath121 are of course sensitive to the observational parameters assumed .",
    "the measured luminosity , distance and structural parameters of the dwarfs are all known with limited accuracy , but the detailed analysis of the errors in them is beyond the scope of this paper . in the case of mond",
    "the most doubtful input parameter is the stellar mass - to - light ratio in v - band .",
    "we have assumed here @xmath91 characteristic for a relatively young stellar population of fornax , however this value may well be different by a factor of two ( mateo et al . 1991 ) . to estimate its effect we performed a similar mond fitting as described in the previous section with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , obtaining respectively @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    "cm / s@xmath4 with the same best - fitting @xmath12 . if @xmath126 is indeed the lower limit of mass - to - light ratio , then @xmath127 cm / s@xmath4 is the upper limit for @xmath76 .    in the case of dm",
    "the stellar mass - to - light is not likely to influence much the results since the input from stars to the velocity dispersion is small . here",
    "the most doubtful parameter is the concentration of dm haloes , which we adopted to follow the same dependence on mass as larger haloes actually studied in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "given , however , that this dependence is weak in the @xmath64cdm universe , the possible error associated with this factor is rather small .",
    "one more reason to worry are the tidal interactions that may affect the dynamics of some dwarfs and our interpretations of their velocity dispersions .",
    "piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) have performed numerical simulations of such effects and concluded that in newtonian dynamics they should not affect much the inferred mass - to - light ratios ( but see kroupa 1997 ) .",
    "however , brada & milgrom ( 2000 ) found that in mond , due to its non - linearity , a galaxy system can be more affected by an external field .",
    "= 8.5 cm    one may ask if similar results hold for other dsph galaxies as well . of those studied by ih the velocity dispersion profiles with a few data points",
    "are available only for sextans , ursa minor and draco dwarfs ( hargreaves et al .",

    "( 1997 ) ( with @xmath128 ) we find that again the mond and dm models can fit the data equally well . for draco the best - fitting models have tangential anisotropy , we get @xmath129 , @xmath130 ( @xmath131 the mass in stars ) for dm and @xmath132 , @xmath133 cm / s@xmath4 for mond . for ursa minor",
    "the best fits require a certain amount of _ radial _ anisotropy which we model with ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath134 kpc , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 the mass in stars ) for dm and @xmath137 kpc , @xmath138 cm / s@xmath4 for mond .",
    "the predictions of the best - fitting models together with the data are shown in figure  [ du ] .",
    "the case of ursa minor is doubtful since it has been recently observed to possess tidal tails ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) and therefore may not be in virial equilibrium .",
    "the high value of @xmath76 estimated for draco can , however , pose a serious problem for mond ( we agree on this point with gerhard & spergel 1992 ) since @xmath76 is supposed to be a universal constant . bringing the value down by an order of magnitude would require very high stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath139 or we would have to believe that the measurements seriously overestimate the velocity dispersion .",
