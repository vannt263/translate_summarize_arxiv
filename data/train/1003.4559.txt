    "in many situations the analytical treatment of a specific physical problem simplifies drastically if the spatial dimension @xmath13 becomes infinite .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that the mean field theory for systems in thermal equilibrium becomes exact for @xmath14 .",
    "the equation of state of a fluid can be obtained from a virial expansion . for the fluid of _ hard spheres _ it has been shown that for such packing fractions @xmath15 for which the second virial term ( which is proportional to @xmath15 ) is finite or at most algebraically increasing with @xmath13 , the third and higher order virial terms vanish exponentially fast in the limit @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hard sphere systems are ideal systems to study not only equilibrium properties , but also the liquid - glass transition and glassy dynamics . the mode - coupling theory ( mct )",
    "@xcite is a microscopic theory of an ideal glass transition .",
    "knowledge of the static density correlators allows to calculate the long time relaxation of a supercooled or supercompressed fluid and to locate the glass transition point at which the ergodic behavior in the fluid phase changes discontinuously into a nonergodic one .",
    "the experimental results for colloidal fluids , which can be modelled by hard spheres , exhibit agreement with the corresponding mct result after the transient regime over several decades in time within ten percent precision @xcite .    properties of equilibrium phase transitions , e.g. the critical exponents at a second order phase transition , depend strongly on the spatial dimensionality .",
    "this has motivated the investigation of the glass transition for @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the most important approximation of mct is the factorization of the memory kernel @xcite .",
    "this kernel is a _ time - dependent _ four - point correlator of the density modes @xmath18 which is approximated by a product of time dependent two - point correlators .",
    "this factorization resembles the mean field approximation replacing a static two - point correlator , e.g. the spin - spin correlator @xmath19 for an ising model , by a product of the order parameter , e.g. the magnetization @xmath20 in case of the ising model .",
    "based on this analogy , mct has been interpreted as a mean field theory with the two - point density correlator as an order parameter @xcite , where spatial fluctuations of the correlation between the pair densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 are neglected . in a next step , these spatial fluctuations are taken into account . finally it is shown that the upper critical dimension where the spatial fluctuations do not influence the critical behaviour is @xmath23 @xcite , for systems without and @xmath24 @xcite with conserved quantities .",
    "this implies that the square root singularity of the nonergodicity parameter and the relation between the exponent parameter @xmath25 and the `` critical '' exponents @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xcite are universal above @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , the exponent parameter @xmath29 itself being determined by the static structure factor at the glass transition singularity , depends on @xmath13 .",
    "the interpretation of mct as a mean field model challenges the investigation of mct with full @xmath3-dependence for @xmath30 .",
    "as already mentioned above , analytical calculations simplify for @xmath0 , e.g. the leading order term of the static and direct correlation function for hard spheres are known and become dominant ( see below ) .",
    "consequently we will focus on the mct glass transition of hard spheres in high dimensions .",
    "let us shortly review what is already known for hard spheres and @xmath30 .",
    "taking for the direct correlation function the leading order of a virial expansion ( see below ) , using the vineyard approximation @xcite for the normalized collective nonergodicity parameters @xmath31 , i.e. it is @xmath32 , and assuming the nonergodicity parameters @xmath33 of the self correlator to be _ gaussian _ in @xmath3 with width @xmath34 , a self consistency equation for @xmath34 follows from mct .",
    "as critical packing fraction for the glass transition it has been found @xcite@xmath35 the replica theory for the structural glass transition @xcite is another microscopic theory .",
    "it allows to calculate the kauzmann temperature @xmath36 or the corresponding packing fraction @xmath37 at which the configurational entropy per particle vanishes . applied to hard spheres in high dimensions and performing a _ small cage expansion _",
    "it is found @xcite @xmath38 our main motivation is to explore the mct scenario for @xmath30 , i.e. we want to investigate whether the @xmath39 singularity @xcite of mct in @xmath40 survives for @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we want to check whether the critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the collective and self correlators , respectively , are gaussian and become equal for @xmath30 and whether the critical packing fraction @xmath43 coincides with @xmath44 and if not how it relates to the kauzmann value @xmath45 . in a first step",
    "we have solved numerically the mct equations for the _ collective _ and _ self _ nonergodicity parameters @xmath31 and @xmath33 , respectively up to @xmath4 .",

    "our aim has not been exploring the validity of the mct approximations for @xmath30 ( we come back to this point below ) but to take mct as a microscopic theory in any dimension and to check the generic mct - bifurcation scenario ( @xmath39 singularity ) and to calculate the critical packing fraction , the corresponding nonergodicity parameters and the exponent parameter .",
    "the direct correlation function for hard ( hyper- ) spheres for finite @xmath13 is not known exactly . however ,",
    "if @xmath298 , being exponentially smaller than @xmath299 at which the kirkwood - like instability occurs , the corrections to the leading order result ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) can be neglected for @xmath30 .",
    "this offers the possibility to calculate various quantities like @xmath43 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath29 from mct for a liquid of hard spheres in high dimensions .",
    "let us first summarize our results . the numerical solution of the mct equations for the collective and self nonergodicity parameters up to @xmath4 reveals non - gaussian dependence of the critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath300 and @xmath301 on the wavenumber @xmath3 ( cf .",

    "@xmath300 increases from @xmath302 to a maximum value close to one .",

    "the decrease to zero happens on the scale @xmath289 in an interval around @xmath208 with width of order @xmath304 .",
    "@xmath305 and @xmath306 are identical for @xmath201 but differ for @xmath307 . the exponent parameter @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] ) varies with @xmath13 even for @xmath308 and strongly exceeds the value @xmath309",
    "@xcite for @xmath147 .",
    "note that @xmath29 can not be larger larger than one .",
    "the critical amplitudes @xmath310 @xcite exhibit the expected @xmath3-dependence .",
    "they are in anti - phase with @xmath41 , i.e. they have a maximum ( minimum ) where @xmath41 has a minimum ( maximum ) .",
    "particularly , on the scale @xmath201 the critical amplitudes are rather small since @xmath311 .",
    "the numerical results ( up to @xmath4 ) also show that the largest eigenvalue @xmath312 of the stability matrix @xcite is not degenerate and it approaches the bifurcation point at @xmath313 as @xmath314 , for @xmath315 from above .",
    "hence the glass transition singularity is an @xmath39 singularity , consistent with an exponent parameter @xmath25 smaller than one , as demonstrated by figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "what happens for @xmath14 is not clear .",
    "the distances between the largest eigenvalues of the stability matrix obtained numerically slightly decrease with increasing @xmath13 . whether or not the largest eigenvalue becomes degenerate for @xmath14 is an open question , similar to the question whether @xmath25 in figure [ fig6 ] converges to one for @xmath245 , or not .",
    "therefore , our numerical results do not allow to exclude a higher order singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "inspired by these numerical results we have been able to prove analytically that the vineyard approximation @xcite becomes exact for @xmath30 on a scale @xmath145 , and that the critical packing fraction @xmath135 decays exponentially as @xmath316 , with a prefactor which is quadratic in @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical result for @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , the analytical approach has also shown that the @xmath3- and @xmath13-dependence of the critical nonergodicity parameters and of the mct functional @xmath317 $ ] at @xmath135 can be obtained from a master function @xmath291 ( cf .",
    "( eq31 ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) ) .",
    "this relationship yields@xmath318where @xmath207 .",
    "although it has not been our purpose to prove or disprove the validity of mct for @xmath30 , it might be useful to comment on this question .",
    "first of all , the vertices ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) seem to be exact for @xmath30 , since the leading order of @xmath72 is known analytically and the neglection of the triplet direct correlation function @xmath319 , which also enters into the vertices @xcite , is justified for @xmath320 and @xmath0 ( see appendix ) .",
    "accordingly the convolution approximation for the static three point correlator @xmath321 ( usually done in mct ) becomes exact for @xmath0 and packing fractions such that @xmath322 does not increase exponentially or faster with @xmath13 .",
    "the factorization of the static four - point density correlator @xmath323 , which is needed for the projector onto pairs of density modes , is another approximation .",
    "similar to @xmath324 ( see appendix ) one can define a quadruplet direct correlation function @xmath325 via a corresponding ornstein - zernike equation .",
    "however , this equation is already rather involved @xcite such that we have not attempted to prove that the factorization is valid for @xmath326 and @xmath245 .",
    "so it remains an open question whether this factorization becomes exact again .",
    "if so , the `` only '' two remaining crucial approximations of mct are the projection of the fluctuating force onto pair modes and the subsequent factorization of the pair density correlator with reduced dynamics into a product of density correlators @xmath327 with full dynamics . whether these two steps become exact for @xmath0",
    "is an interesting but also a highly nontrivial question .",
    "activated processes smear out the glass transition singularity .",
    "since it seems that the local barriers between adjacent metastable configurations increase with increasing @xmath13 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) these hopping processes may become suppressed for @xmath0 .",
    "even if this is true , it is not obvious that the remaining two approximation of mct become exact for @xmath0 .",
    "one might conclude that mct for @xmath30 necessarily fails because of @xmath328 for @xmath145 , excluding the cage effect @xcite as driving mechanism and one may argue that the dynamics will be described better by a boltzmann - enskog equation . indeed , a modified enskog equation was derived from the binary - collision expansion @xcite . but its validity for packing fractions of order @xmath316 has not been proven . here ,",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "_ first _ , a cage does not necessarily require a maximum number of adjacent spheres .",
    "for instance a ( simple- ) hypercubic lattice built up of periodically arranged hyperspheres has @xmath329 nearest neighbors and a volume fraction @xmath330 , which is much smaller than @xmath331 . therefore",
    ", the number of contacts between neighbors for @xmath332 could be large enough in order to have a cage .",
    "furthermore there is evidence that the packing fraction @xmath333 for maximally random jammed states in @xmath13 dimensions is given by @xmath334 @xcite or even with an additional term with a quadratic prefactor @xmath335 @xcite .",
    "these densities are not larger than @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding pair correlation function @xmath336 flattens under an increase of @xmath13 from @xmath337 to @xmath338 @xcite , i.e. comes closer to the ideal gas value @xmath339 , for @xmath340 .",
    "_ second _ , concerning mct @xmath328 does not imply that the direct correlation function @xmath341 and the vertices are zero .",
    "it is the quadratic dependence of the vertices on @xmath72 in combination with its explicit @xmath78-dependence and the use of the scaled variables @xmath342 which make the coupling of the modes finite , despite the small packing fraction @xmath343 .",
    "this is completely similar to the mct approach to colloidal gelation for a liquid of hard spheres with attractive yukawa potential @xcite .",
    "for packing fraction @xmath344 and potential strength @xmath345 with @xmath346 these authors prove that @xmath347 for all @xmath3 .",
    "however , the vertices remain finite . at a critical value",
    "@xmath348 a liquid - gel transition occurs .",
    "@xmath349 is similar to @xmath350 , quite analogous to our outcome .",
    "the equilibrium structure at @xmath348 is highly ramified where the `` caging '' of a sphere is generated by a smaller number of neighbors .      in section a.",
    "we have presented our various results from mct in high dimensions .",
    "now we want to discuss the most essential findings in the light of earlier results and will draw some conclusions .",
    "our critical nonergodicity parameters have a non - gaussian @xmath3-dependence , in variance with the assumption in ref .",
    "this discrepancy is the origin of the different pre - exponential factor of the critical packing fraction which we have found to be quadratic in @xmath13 , and not linear @xcite . due to this quadratic @xmath13-dependence our mct result for @xmath43 is larger than the kauzmann packing fraction @xmath351 ( eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) ) .",
    "this can not be true , since the packing fraction for the kauzmann transition ( static glass transition ) should be above the packing fraction for the mct transition ( dynamical glass transition ) .",
    "@xmath352 has been calculated within a small cage expansion @xcite , which is a kind of gaussian approximation .",
    "this could be the reason why @xmath352 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ) is below @xmath135 ( eq . ( [ eq23 ] ) ) .    as argued in subsection b. it is not necessarily true that a structureless static correlator rules out caging .",
    "but , even if the cage effect would be absent , the essential question would be whether the quality of both mct approximations _ necessarily _ requires the existence of caging , or not . since an analytical investigation of the validity of these approximations seems to be extremely difficult , a way to get",
    "an insight is an approach by a computer simulation .",
    "provided such simulational results would deviate more and more from our results with increasing dimensions this would hint at a failure of mct for @xmath30 . such a failure would imply that mct , which has been interpreted as a mean field theory @xcite , does not become exact in the limit of high dimensions , in contrast to equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "we hope that these concluding remarks may stimulate and encourage further investigations , contributing to a better understanding of mct .",

    "the numerous helpful comments on our manuscript by g. biroli , w. gtze and f. zamponi are gratefully acknowledged as well .",
    "we want to prove the following statement : for all packing fractions @xmath353 such that @xmath354 does not increase exponentially or faster with @xmath13 for @xmath0 , the static three - point correlation function @xmath355 reduces in the limit of high dimensions to @xmath356 , i.e. the convolution approximation becomes exact . for this proof we use the ornstein - zernike equation for three - particle correlation functions",

    "this expansion only consists of loop diagrams .",
    "we want to show now , that the contribution of each of these diagrams to @xmath365 vanishes in the limit @xmath0 .",
