    "<S> we analytically calculate the average value of @xmath0-th largest schmidt coefficient for random pure quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> schmidt coefficients , i.e. , eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , are expressed in the limit of large hilbert space size and for arbitrary bipartite splitting as an implicit function of index @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is a valuable quantum resource and as such a lot of attention has been devoted to studies of entanglement and ways of exploiting entanglement present in various quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> random quantum states are interesting for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> they are used in various quantum information processes like e.g. in quantum communication . </S>",
    "<S> also , a generic quantum evolution falling under the label of quantum chaos will produce a random state from almost arbitrary initial state . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to understand entanglement properties of random quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> it comes as no surprise that the subject has a long history , for instance , entropy of a subsystem has been calculated in  @xcite while purity has been studied in  @xcite . from a practical point of view </S>",
    "<S> a relevant question is how to generate random pure states ? </S>",
    "<S> several methods have been proposed , using the so - called pseudo - random unitary operators  @xcite which are characterized by the number of random parameters scaling polynomially with the number of qubits and not exponentially as it would be required in order to generate true random unitary operators . </S>",
    "<S> of course , using less than a full set of exponentially many parameters causes pseudo - random operators to be just an approximation to the true ones . nevertheless </S>",
    "<S> , if a common criterion of entanglement such as purity or von neumann entropy of a subsystem is used , the convergence to the asymptotic values of purity or entropy is observed already after polynomial number of steps . while purity might be a perfectly good benchmark for certain purposes we must nevertheless keep in mind that purity or entropy of a subsystem is just one of many possible entanglement measures of pure states . in fact , to fully characterize entanglement properties of a given bipartite state a full list of schmidt coefficients </S>",
    "<S> is needed . </S>",
    "<S> if we have a bipartite hilbert space @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being dimension of @xmath4 and @xmath5 of @xmath6 , the schmidt decomposition is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are orthonormal on respective subspaces @xmath4 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> squares of schmidt coefficients @xmath10 are nothing but the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , @xmath11 , obtained by tracing over subspace @xmath6 . without sacrificing generality </S>",
    "<S> we will assume @xmath12 as well as that the eigenvalues @xmath13 of @xmath14 are listed in decreasing order . </S>",
    "<S> schmidt coefficients are invariant under local transformation ( transformations acting separably on @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) and fully specify bipartite entanglement of state @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a set of @xmath16 entanglement monotones , for instance , sums of @xmath17 smallest eigenvalues , is needed to characterize pure state entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a sum of @xmath17 smallest eigenvalues is also a good estimate for the truncation error in recently proposed numerical method  @xcite for simulation of weakly entangled quantum systems using matrix product state representation  @xcite . for random states </S>",
    "<S> joint distribution @xmath18 of eigenvalues is a well known quantity  @xcite , see equation ( [ eq : p ] ) below . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not particularly convenient to deal directly with the distribution in @xmath3 dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> it would be much simpler to have some scalar quantities which could be used as a benchmark for the randomness of quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> because the eigenvalues fully determine entanglement we are going to calculate the average value of @xmath10 for random quantum states , i.e. , the average value of @xmath0-th largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix , @xmath19 , where the angle brackets denote averaging over random states . random vectors @xmath15 in @xmath20 can be obtained in two equivalent ways . as columns of random unitary matrices distributed according to the invariant haar measure , which can in turn be obtained by , e.g. , hurwitz parametrization of the unitary group . a second , simpler procedure , is to simply draw real and imaginary parts of expansion coefficients of @xmath21 as random gaussian variables , subsequently normalizing the vector  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . we will be especially interested in the limit of large dimensions @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath10 scale as @xmath22 ( due to @xmath23 ) , we will define a function @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 the function @xmath24 becomes a continuous function with the definition range @xmath27 $ ] and not e.g. @xmath28 is purely empirical . by comparing our analytical solution for @xmath24 with numerics for finite @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> we have found that setting @xmath29 gives better agreement than e.g. @xmath28 or @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> note though , that the difference between all these choices of @xmath31 goes to zero with @xmath26 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> deriving and studying the function @xmath24 is the main aim of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways of calculating @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the most direct one is by using joint density of eigenvalues @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> while such method is exact for all @xmath3 it is rather complicated . as we are mainly interested in the asymptotic @xmath26 behaviour we are going to use simpler method to derive @xmath24 in the second part of the paper .    for random @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of eigenvalues is  @xcite @xmath33 to calculate the average of @xmath34th largest eigenvalue @xmath10 or its distribution it is useful to first define the probability @xmath35 that exactly @xmath0 eigenvalues lie in the interval @xmath36 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then the probability density of @xmath0-th eigenvalue is given by @xmath37 , obtained as @xmath38 for standard gaussian random matrix ensembles the distribution of the largest eigenvalue has been calculated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> average value of @xmath0-th eigenvalue is then simply @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the smallest and the largest eigenvalues are given by @xmath40 where the inner integral is over @xmath16 arguments of @xmath41 ( [ eq : p ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> using these formulae in the simplest case of a symmetric bipartite cut with @xmath42 one obtains for @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 , while for @xmath46 one gets @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated @xmath50 for several other small values of @xmath3 with the result always being @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conjecture that for @xmath42 we have in general @xmath52 even though the integrals in ( [ eq : int ] ) can be connected to laguerre polynomials  @xcite they are non - trivial because the inner integrations are over a finite range . </S>",
    "<S> to calculate @xmath24 in the limit @xmath26 we will use a different approach . </S>",
    "<S> instead of using the exact @xmath41 and afterwards taking the limit we will instead use the density of eigenvalues @xmath53 which is already evaluated in the @xmath54 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> eigenvalue density @xmath55 of scaled eigenvalues @xmath56 can be obtained by integrating out @xmath16 eigenvalues in @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath3 and @xmath5 the result is  @xcite @xmath58 if @xmath59 $ ] , otherwise @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> parameters @xmath61 are given as @xmath62 the above density of eigenvalues ( [ eq : p ] ) is well known in statistics , where it occurs as eigenvalue density of random covariance matrices @xmath63 , also known as wishart matrices , and is called marenko - pastur law  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the simplest case of an equal partition , @xmath42 , we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 , resulting in @xmath66 . moments of eigenvalue distribution , @xmath67 have been calculated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath24 from @xmath55 is simple because @xmath24 is by definition a decreasing function of @xmath31 . noting that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is such that @xmath70 , we can immediately write differential equation for @xmath24 , @xmath71 with @xmath72 and the boundary conditions @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> let us first study the symmetric case of equal bipartition , @xmath42 , and then separately the general @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> integrating ( [ eq : f ] ) once , using ( [ eq : p ] ) and setting @xmath42 , we get @xmath24 in an implicit form @xmath76     ( [ eq : f ] ) for @xmath42 . in the right frame is a semi - log plot.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( [ eq : f ] ) for @xmath42 . in the right frame </S>",
    "<S> is a semi - log plot.,title=\"fig : \" ]    functional form of @xmath24 ( [ eq : f ] ) can be seen in figure  [ fig : ran_lam ] . for small or for </S>",
    "<S> large values of @xmath31 , i.e. , for large and small eigenvalues , one can expand implicit solution ( [ eq : f ] ) to get @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the largest eigenvalue is @xmath81 , while the smallest one scales as @xmath82 , in accordance with the conjecture ( [ eq : min ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical formula for @xmath24 ( [ eq : f ] ) gives asymptotic @xmath26 result . </S>",
    "<S> what about the eigenvalues for finite @xmath3 ? </S>",
    "<S> we performed numerical calculation of average @xmath10 by randomly drawing vectors and then calculating the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence to the asymptotic @xmath24 is pretty fast and already for moderate @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , theoretical formula ( [ eq : f ] ) agrees with numerical @xmath10 to better than 1% . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ran_err ] we can see that the relative error decreases as @xmath22 apart from the smallest eigenvalue ( and possibly few smallest ones ) for which theoretical formula ( [ eq : f ] ) gives @xmath86 while the exact value is conjectured to be @xmath51 ( [ eq : min ] ) .     </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath83 , @xmath87 ( top to bottom ) , as compared to the theoretical formula for @xmath24 ( [ eq : f ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> relative error decreases as @xmath88 . ]     </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eta],[eq : f ] ) committed by retaining a fraction @xmath31 of the largest eigenvalues . in the inset is a semi - log plot of the same @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> all for @xmath42 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have also numerically calculated the width @xmath90 of the distribution of @xmath10 , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical data ( not shown ) indicate that the width @xmath92 is approximately equal to one half of the spacing @xmath93 . using theoretical formula for the spacing ( i.e. for @xmath94 ) we have found that an approximate relation @xmath95 holds , where @xmath24 is given in ( [ eq : f ] ) . with increasing @xmath3 the relative width decreases and therefore the eigenvalues become increasingly peaked around their average @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> if we want to approximate a given state with less than a full set of parameters , e.g. as a matrix product state  @xcite , the quantity that estimates an error made by retaining only a fraction @xmath31 of largest eigenvalues is @xmath89 , defined as @xmath96 changing integrating variable from @xmath31 to @xmath97 the above integral can be evaluated . using our @xmath24 we get @xmath98 with @xmath97 being the solution of equation ( [ eq : f ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> plot of @xmath89 ( [ eq : eta ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : eta ] . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting thing we can see is that because @xmath24 behaves as @xmath99 close to @xmath100 , the smallest eigenvalues contribute very little to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the first 80% of eigenvalues sum to more than @xmath101 , i.e. , discarding 20% of the smallest eigenvalues will cause fidelity error of no more than @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now go to the general case of @xmath12 . by a similar procedure </S>",
    "<S> as for symmetric @xmath42 situation we arrive at the implicit formula for @xmath24 , @xmath103 where @xmath61 and @xmath104 are given in ( [ eq : w ] ) . by comparing matrix eigenvalue equation for wishart matrices ( i.e. , @xmath63 , which is nothing but the unnormalized reduced density matrix in our language ) and zeros of laguerre polynomials in the limit @xmath54 , it has been shown in  @xcite that the two converge to one another . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the limit @xmath54 the @xmath0-th zero of a generalized laguerre polynomial @xmath105 converges to @xmath106 , i.e. , to @xmath107 with @xmath24 given in equation ( [ eq : fg ] ) .     for a bipartite cut to @xmath108 and @xmath109 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> circles are numerics for @xmath110 while the full line is theoretical @xmath24 ( [ eq : fg ] ) . ]    to verify theoretical formula ( [ eq : fg ] ) we performed numerical calculation for random vectors in @xmath111 dimensional hilbert space , making a bipartite cut to @xmath108 and @xmath109 qubits , i.e. , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of numerics and theory for @xmath115 and @xmath116 is in figure  [ fig : allr ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that with increasing @xmath117 , as the subspaces @xmath4 and @xmath6 become of increasingly different size , the reduced density matrix on @xmath4 has increasingly flat spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> when one of the subspaces is much larger than the other , that is when @xmath118 , we can simplify the general equation for @xmath24 ( [ eq : fg ] ) to arrive at @xmath119 for small @xmath104 the eigenvalues of @xmath14 therefore deviate from @xmath88 by @xmath120 . the fact that with increasing @xmath117 all eigenvalues are essentially @xmath121 is well known . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if we trace a random pure state over large `` environment '' the resulting density matrix will be almost proportional to the identity , e.g. , its purity is close to @xmath88  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , deviations from this totally mixed state go to zero if @xmath5 increases at a fixed @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the so - called measure concentration in many dimensional spaces  @xcite   bounded random numbers deviates by more than @xmath122 from its average is exponentially small in the dimension @xmath123 as well as in @xmath124 . ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eta],[eq : fg ] ) for the same hilbert space splitting as in figure  [ fig : allr ] . in the right frame </S>",
    "<S> @xmath125 is plotted as a function of @xmath126 so that a given @xmath127 represents the same number of eigenvalues for all @xmath117 and not the same fraction , as in the left plot.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( [ eq : eta],[eq : fg ] ) for the same hilbert space splitting as in figure  [ fig : allr ] . in the right frame </S>",
    "<S> @xmath125 is plotted as a function of @xmath126 </S>",
    "<S> so that a given @xmath127 represents the same number of eigenvalues for all @xmath117 and not the same fraction , as in the left plot.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the error @xmath89 ( [ eq : etadef ] ) made by retaining only @xmath128 largest eigenvalues is for @xmath75 given by exactly the same expression as for @xmath42 ( [ eq : eta ] ) , the only difference is that @xmath97 is given by the solution of ( [ eq : fg ] ) . because the spectrum of @xmath14 becomes flat for large @xmath117 , @xmath89 approaches linear function . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in figure  [ fig : etar ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of retained eigenvalues @xmath129 depends on @xmath117 , we also plot in the right frame of figure  [ fig : etar ] dependence of @xmath125 on the absolute number of retained eigenvalues . from this plot </S>",
    "<S> one can see that for instance , keeping @xmath130 largest eigenvalues in all bipartite cuts , we make an error @xmath131 for symmetric cut with @xmath132 , error @xmath133 for @xmath134 , @xmath135 for @xmath136 , while for larger @xmath117 s the error is zero because the dimension @xmath3 of @xmath4 is smaller than the number of retained eigenvalues @xmath130 . </S>",
