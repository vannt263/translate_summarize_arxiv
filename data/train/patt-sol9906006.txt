    "the phenomenon of modulational instability ( mi ) can be defined as self - induced break up of an initially homogeneous wave during its evolution in a nonlinear medium .",
    "study of this phenomenon has been initiated in the 60 s , when mi was predicted in plasma physics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite and physics of fluids @xcite , and also observed experimentally in form of filamentation of an optical beam propagating in an organic liquid @xcite . since that time mi has remained as one of the major topics of theoretical and experimental research in nonlinear physics and , in particular , in nonlinear physics of conservative systems @xcite .",
    "we will deal below with one classical example of such systems , unifying a number of previous results , and presenting new mi phenomena .",
    "our approach stresses the central role of symmetries .",
    "a general formulation of the problem of nonlinear wave propagation via fundamental sets of equations , as for example , the maxwell or navier stokes equations , is a very demanding task even for modern computers .",
    "therefore a number of simplified models have been introduced which approximately describe either propagation of the wave itself , e.g. , kdv equation @xcite , or propagation of slowly varying wave envelope , e.g. , the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite .",
    "the simplest solutions of envelope equations are continuous wave ( cw ) solutions homogeneous in space and time .",
    "cws in single nls equation exhibit mi in cases when nonlinearity and group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) or diffraction act in opposition , e.g. when nonlinearity is positive gvd must be anomalous and if nonlinearity is negative gvd must be normal .",
    "this rule changes when , accounting for polarization , for different directions of wave vectors , or for different carrier frequencies of the interacting waves , one replaces the single nls by the set of incoherently coupled nls equations . then , if nonlinear coupling is strong enough , mi of cws becomes possible for any signs of nonlinearity and gvd @xcite .",
    "another important class of solutions of nonlinear equations are solitary solutions ( solitons )",
    ". they may also exhibit mi if they are localized in some dimensions but extended in one or more others .",
    "mis of the envelope solitons of the single nls and of the kdv solitons were pioneered , respectively , by zakharov and rubenchik @xcite and by kadomtsev and petviashvily @xcite .",
    "latter mi was studied in a number of other theoretical and experimental works . for reviews on mi of bright and dark solitary waves",
    "see , respectively , @xcite and @xcite .    from a formal point of view the problem of the solitary wave",
    "mi can be considered as continuation of the soliton spectrum at zero modulational frequency @xmath0 into the region @xmath1 .",
    "an important class of discrete eigenmodes at @xmath2 are the zero eigenvalue ( or neutral ) modes .",
    "presence of which is directly linked to symmetries of the model equations . on a qualitative level",
    ", similarities and differences between mi of solitons and cw solutions can be understood on the basis of a comparison between the corresponding neutral modes .",
    "for example , the 1d , bright spatial soliton of nls is modulationally unstable in media with either anomalous or normal gvd .",
    "in first case , the neutral mode associated with the phase symmetry is excited ( neck mi ) and in latter situation the translational mode associated with a shift along the direction perpendicular to the wave propagation becomes unstable ( snake mi ) @xcite .",
    "the phase mode is present as well for cw solution and this leads to mi for anomalous gvd .",
    "however , the translational mode of cw solution is null and therefore cws are stable for normal gvd .",
    "increasing the number of free parameters can lead to more complex scenarios of mi , because coexistence and competition between different types of instability are likely to happen . in a recent letter @xcite we considered",
    "gvd induced mi of spatial solitons due to nondegenerate three - wave mixing .",
    "it was shown that presence of an additional phase symmetry leads to the appearance of a new branch of neck mi in media with normal gvd .",
    "it was found that the novel instability strongly dominates the usual snake mi throughout the region of soliton existence .",
    "note , that because of this dominance , physical mechanisms responsible for the relative strength of neck and snake instabilities remain to be understood . among others ,",
    "this last problem is addressed in the present work , where we study mi of the bright solitary solutions in the incoherently coupled nls equations .",
    "the incoherent nature of the coupling results in the presence of two phase symmetries . in spite of the similar symmetry properties ,",
    "the features of mi induced dynamics of solitons in the present model appear to be more rich compare to the three - wave mixing case . in particular we show that the relative strength of the nonlinear cross - coupling governs the competition between neck and snake mis in media with normal gvd .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce model equations and discuss their physical relevance . in section 3 the problem of mi of the solitary waves",
    "is formulated in general terms .",
    "mi of different kinds of solitary solutions and its physical interpretation in terms of polarization dynamics are detailed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "discussion and summary of main results are presented in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "the evolution of two suitably scaled slowly varying incoherently coupled wave envelopes @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a weakly nonlinear , dispersive and diffractive medium is governed by the following equations @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "longitudinal @xmath7 and transverse @xmath8 coordinates are respectively measured in units of a suitable diffraction length @xmath9 and of a characteristic transverse size of the envelope .",
    "the coordinate @xmath10 is the retarded time scaled to the parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the temporal duration of the envelope and @xmath13 is a characteristic gvd length .",

    "propagation of quasimonochromatic e / m waves in isotropic dielectric materials leads to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , where , in such a case , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are envelopes of the left- and right- polarized components @xcite .",
    "the diffraction and gvd parameters can be taken as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor .",
    "for example , @xmath24 for the nonresonant electronic nonlinearity and @xmath25 for the nonlinearity due to molecular orientation @xcite .",
    "for e / m waves propagating in an isotropic plasma , @xmath19 strongly depends on the ratio between the frequency of the e / m wave and the characteristic electron plasma frequency , and it can have either sign @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) can also be applied to describe interaction of circularly polarised waves in waveguides filled with linearly isotropic material , as , e.g. , @xmath26 liquid @xcite , in opposite situation linear coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath4 should be incorporated in the model .",
    "counterpropagation of scalar waves in kerr media obeys eqs .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath19 determined by the wavelength - scale refractive index gratings written by the interference pattern @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath19 in this situation is directly linked with diffusion which washes out the grating making @xmath27 ( @xmath24 for zero diffusion ) .",

    "the limiting case @xmath28 describes a situation with zero self - modulation effects .",
    "this approximates the so called cascading limit of non - degenerate three - wave mixing in the quadratically nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "therefore one can expect that for the large enough @xmath19 mi of the solitary solutions of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) should be equivalent to the mi of the three - wave solitons @xcite but that it should well be different for the relatively small @xmath19 .    because the discussion of a wide range of @xmath19 values is more realistic in the context of the interaction of the circularly polarized waves , below we mainly use terminology which is appropriate to this case .",

    "these solutions are well known , see , e.g. @xcite and refs . therein . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the situation when the solitary waves are stable for @xmath29 . therefore we choose @xmath30 , because it ensures absence of the splitting instability @xcite , and @xmath31 , to avoid collapse @xcite .",

    "therefore they have identical spectra and in case of instability the imaginary and real parts of perturbations grow with the same rates . to answer stability question it is thus enough to study only one of the evps , and we concentrate below on the evp ( [ eq6b ] ) .",

    "the soliton stripe breaks in such a way as to form the interleaved intensity peaks of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , as expected when the out of phase neck mi is dominant .",
    "the spatio - temporal patterns formed at the initial stage of mi finally spread because of the unbalanced action of the normal gvd and self - focusing nonlinearity . for @xmath218",
    "we observed competition between the neck and snake mis , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( b@xmath219 ) , ( b@xmath220 ) one can clearly see that at the intermediate stage of mi the typical in - phase snake pattern is superimposed on the anti - phase neck pattern .",
    "thus , we conclude , that in the media with normal gvd spatial soliton stripes perfectly develop snake mi without polarization symmetry breaking if @xmath221 and neck mi with polarization symmetry breaking if @xmath222 .",

    "the in - phase mi dominates the anti - phase one for any value of @xmath134 and @xmath19 , which means conservation of the polarization state imposed by the initial conditions .",
    "nonzero imbalancing for fixed total energy leads to the growth of the in - phase mi and to the suppression of the anti - phase one , see fig .",
    "11(a),(b ) . for @xmath139 only in - phase instability exists , but now imbalancing leads to the suppression of the instability , see fig .",

    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] . a typical result of the numerical simulation of the neck instability development is shown in fig . [ fig14 ] .",
    "note that the numerically attainable propagation distance was limited by the distance at which the most intense filaments formed at the initial stage of mi collapse to singularities .",
    "cut - off frequencies , where the neck mis disappear can be found analytically for @xmath131 . growth rate of the in - phase mi becomes zero at @xmath223 in full analogy with single nls equation , see section iv .",
    "the anti - phase mi disappears at @xmath224 having @xmath225 and @xmath226 , here @xmath227 , @xmath228 .",
    "thus , in the media with anomalous gvd spatial soliton stripe always develops neck mi without polarization symmetry breaking and filamentary structure formed during this process collapses upon propagation .",
    "detailed study of collapse in coupled nls equations is outwith the scope of this paper .",
    "some details on this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare mi of solitons with results on mi of cws @xcite , which can be easily recovered from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq6a ] ) , ( [ eq6b ] ) putting @xmath229 . for simplicity we again consider the case of the linear polarization , @xmath230 . then corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath231 and @xmath232 . for normal gvd , @xmath233 can be positive only for @xmath139 .",
    "for anomalous gvd , @xmath234 generates instability for any @xmath19 and @xmath233 only for @xmath138 .",
    "thus , as one could expect , neck instabilities of solitons related to the phase symmetries have analogies for cws .",
    "snake instabilities are obviously absent for cws , which is the main difference between the dynamics of spatially confined solitons and infinitely extended cws .",
    "namely , in the case of normal gvd , cws are modulationally stable for @xmath138 and unstable for @xmath139 ( demonstrating polarization symmetry breaking ) .",
    "solitons are snake unstable in this situation for any @xmath19 and this instability does not involve changes in the polarization state . however , starting from a critical value of @xmath235 the snake instability becomes suppressed by the neck one , which is analogous to instability of cw",
    ". this instability does lead to polarization symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular , a linearly polarized soliton breaks , due to this instability , into the chain of circularly polarized clusters . because snake instability leads to spatial symmetry breaking and neck mi does not , the change in mi of solitons at @xmath235 can be interpreted as _ a transition from spatial symmetry breaking to polarization symmetry breaking . _    in the limit situation @xmath236 self - phase effects are negligible compare to cross - phase ones and development of the in - phase and anti - phase neck mis can be qualitatively explained using fermat s principle .",
    "due to mi development the effective refractive index for @xmath3 and @xmath4 fields gets modulated through the xpm mechanism with period @xmath104 .",
    "this results in temporal cross - defocusing of filaments in media with normal gvd and in cross - focusing for anomalous gvd .",
    "thus , in the case of normal gvd , interleaved pattern of the intensity peaks of @xmath3 and @xmath4 fields should be preferable because it enables each field to see a refractive index that increases to its peak , i.e. one that is in accord with fermat s principle .",
    "this is clearly verified in fig.9 .",
    "the same arguments lead to the conclusion that a pattern with all intensity peaks coincident is preferable for anomalous gvd .    considering possibility of experimental observations of predicted phenomena",
    ", we have to say that diffraction induced mi of soliton - like stripe , which is formally equivalent to the case of anomalous gvd , is probably easiest to observe .",
    "however , it is less interesting at the same time because it is perfectly analogous to mi of cws and it is not accompanied by any polarization effects .",
    "more interesting dynamics is expected in media with normal gvd .",
    "in fact , experimental observation of temporal splitting induced by normal gvd of spatially confined pulses in a self - focusing medium was recently reported in @xcite . however",
    ", transverse and polarization effects , which , accordingly to our results , should play an important role , were not studied during this experiment .",
    "numerical studies @xcite presented to support the experimental results were restricted by scalar approximation and radial geometry .",
    "the rescaled instability growth rate @xmath237 as function of the modulational frequency @xmath0 can be related to physical units using the formulae : @xmath238 here @xmath239 and @xmath240 are the instability growth rate and modulational frequency in physical units , @xmath241 is the wave vector , @xmath242 is the beam width , @xmath243 .",
    "for example for radiation at @xmath244 propagating in an algaas planar waveguide @xmath245 @xcite and for typical soliton transverse size @xmath246 @xcite we get @xmath247 and @xmath248 . for experiments",
    "with fused silica at wavelength @xmath249 , see second from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "we have analyzed and described dispersive mi of families of nodeless spatial solitons in the system of the two incoherently coupled nls equations .",
    "considering coupled soliton states , we have established the existence of the four branches of instabilities , which are linked to the symmetries in the absolute and relative phases and in the absolute and relative motions of solitons .",
    "we gave a physical interpretation of our results describing gvd - induced polarization dynamics .",
    "in particularly , we found that in media with normal gvd the mi induced spatial symmetry breaking in the transverse plane changes to the polarization symmetry breaking when the relative strength of the cross - phase modulation exceeds a certain threshold value . in media with anomalous gvd , mi results in breaking of spatial solitons into spatio - temporal clusters which collapse upon further propagation .",
    "this is not followed by either spatial or polarization symmetry breaking .",
