    "over 400 exoplanets have been discovered by various techniques during the past 15 years . among the techniques ,",
    "precise doppler technique has been the most powerful method for planet detection around various types of stars including solar - type stars , evolved giants and subgiants , early - type stars , and so on ( e.g. udry & santos 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , precise doppler measurements in infrared wavelength region started to explore planets around very low - mass stars down to 0.1 @xmath0 ( bean et al .",
    "these surveys will help us to understand properties of planets as a function of stellar mass , age , evolutionary stage , and so on , and thus provide us more general picture of planet formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , planets around giants and subgiants have been extensively surveyed over the past several years mainly from the viewpoint of planet searches around intermediate - mass ( 1.55@xmath0 ) stars ( e.g. frink et al .",

    "intermediate - mass dwarfs , namely ba - type dwarfs , are more difficult for doppler planet searches because of paucity of spectral features and their rotational broadening .",
    "it is thus difficult to achieve high measurement precision in radial velocity ( but see eg .",
    "galland et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , those in evolved stages , namely gk - type giants and subgiants , have many sharp absorption lines in their spectra suitable for precise radial velocity measurements , which makes them promising targets for doppler planet searches .",
    "actually , more than 30 substellar companions to such evolved stars have been already found and they have shown remarkable properties : more than twice higher occurrence rate of giant planets for intermediate - mass subgiants than that for lower - mass stars ( johnson et al . 2007b ; bowler et al .",

    "2009a ) , and lack of metal - rich tendency in host stars ( pasquini et al . 2007 ; takeda et al . 2008 ) .",
    "all these statistical properties should be confirmed by collecting a larger number of samples .    since 2001 , we have been carrying out a doppler planet search program targeting 300 gk giants at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) and have discovered 9 planets and 1 brown dwarf so far from the program ( sato et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 , 2008ab ; liu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in order to further extend the survey , we have established an international consortium between chinese , korean , and japanese researchers using 2 m class telescopes in the three countries ( east - asian planet search network ; izumiura 2005 ) , which recently announced discoveries of a planet ( liu et al .",
    "2009 ) and a brown dwarf ( omiya et al . 2009 ) around gk giants .",
    "a total of about 600 gk giants are now under survey by the consortium .    in this paper , we report the detections of two new substellar companions around intermediate - mass giants ( hd 145457 and hd 180314 ) from our newly started planet search program using subaru 8.2 m telescope and the above 2 m class telescopes .",
    "the substellar companions presented here were uncovered by the initial screening with subaru and followed up with oao 1.88 m telescope .",
    "we describe the outline of the subaru survey in section 2 and the observations in section 3 .",
    "the stellar properties are presented in section 4 , and radial velocities , orbital solutions , and results of line shape analysis are provided in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the main purpose of the subaru program is to quickly identify planet - hosting candidates from hundreds of sample stars taking advantage of the large telescope aperture .",
    "our basic strategy is thus to observe each star three times in a semester with an interval of about 1.5 months for the first screening to identify stars showing large radial velocity variations . since it is known that planets with periods less than 130 days seem to be rare around giants , we focus on the detection of planets with longer periods at first . for stars which turn out to show large radial velocity variations , we conduct follow - up observations using 1.8 m telescope at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ; korea ) , 2.16 m telescope at xinglong station ( china ) , and 1.88 m telescope at oao ( japan ) to confirm their periodicity . for this purpose ,",
    "our science targets are typically brighter than visual magnitude @xmath9 , which are barely observable using the 2 m class telescopes with a doppler precision of @xmath10 m s@xmath11 .",
    "our survey targets for subaru are selected from the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) according to the following criteria , which are basically the same as those for individual planet searches at boao , xinglong , and oao except for visual magnitude : stars with 1 ) @xmath12 to attain a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to achieve a precision of @xmath13 m s@xmath11 even using 2 m class telescopes , 2 ) a color index of @xmath14 to achieve intrinsic radial velocity stability to a level of @xmath15 m s@xmath11 , 3 ) an absolute magnitude of @xmath16 to include stars with masses of 1.55@xmath0 , and 4 ) a declination of @xmath17 to be observed from all 4 sites mentioned above .",
    "we conducted the first observation in 2006 at subaru and completed the initial screening for about 300 stars in the last 4 years .",
    "we obtained a total of 3 spectra for each of hd 145457 and hd 180314 in 2006 april , may , and july using high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) equipped with subaru .",
    "we used an iodine absorption cell ( i@xmath18 cell ; kambe et al .",
    "2002 ) to provide fiducial wavelength reference for precise radial velocity measurement .",
    "we adopted the setup of stdi2b in the first two runs and stdi2a in the third one , which covers a wavelength region of 35006200 @xmath19 and 49007600 @xmath19 , respectively , in order to inspect as many absorption lines as possible for stellar abundance analysis .",
    "the slit width was set to 0@xmath20.6 , giving a wavelength resolution ( @xmath21 ) of 60,000 . typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was 150230 pix@xmath11 for hd 145457 and 100170 pix@xmath11 for hd 180314 with an exposure time of 45180 sec depending on weather condition .    after the observations at subaru , we found that the stars showed large radial velocity variations with @xmath2245 m s@xmath11 and then started follow - up observations using 1.88 m telescope with high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; izumiura 1999 ) at oao .",

    "the wavelength region was set to cover 37507500 @xmath19 using red cross - disperser and the slit width was set to 0@xmath20.78 , giving a wavelength resolution of 67,000 by about 3.3 pixels sampling .",
    "we used an i@xmath18 cell for precise radial velocity measurement and also took pure stellar spectra without i@xmath18 cell for abundance analysis .",
    "typical s / n was 170 pix@xmath11 for both stars with an exposure time of 1500 sec .",
    "the reduction of echelle data for hds and hides was performed using the iraf software package in the standard manner .    for precise doppler analysis",
    ", we basically adopted the modeling technique of an i@xmath18-superposed stellar spectrum ( star+i@xmath18 ) detailed in sato et al .",

    "a star+i@xmath18 spectrum is modeled as a product of a high resolution i@xmath18 and a stellar template spectrum convolved with a modeled instrumental profile ( ip ) of the spectrograph .",
    "the ip is modeled with a combination of a central and several satellite gaussian profiles which are placed at appropriate intervals and have suitable widths , depending on the properties of the spectrograph ( e.g. valenti et al .",
    "1995 ; sato et al .",
    "2002 ) . to obtain the stellar template , sato et al .",
    "( 2002 ) extracted a high resolution stellar spectrum from several star+i@xmath18 spectra .",
    "however , when we applied the technique to the hds data , we found that systematic errors sometimes appeared in radial velocities derived by using thus obtained template .",
    "we finally found that such systematic errors disappeared when we used a stellar template derived from a hides spectrum that was obtained by deconvolving a pure stellar spectrum with the spectrograph ip estimated from a b - star+i@xmath18 spectrum .",
    "therefore , we decided to use the same stellar template thus obtained from hides data for the radial velocity analysis of both hds and hides data .",
    "hd 145457 ( hip 79219 ) is listed in the hipparcos catalog as a k0 iii giant star with a magnitude @xmath23 and a color index @xmath24 .",
    "the hipparcos parallax @xmath25 mas corresponds to a distance of 126@xmath2612 pc , an absolute magnitude @xmath27 .",
    "the color excess @xmath28 was calibrated according to beer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the interstellar extinction @xmath29 .",

    "( 2001 ) , and a bolometric correction @xmath32 was derived from the calibration of alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) depending on temperature and metallicity .",
    "then the stellar luminosity was estimated to @xmath33 , and a radius to @xmath34 .",
    "stellar mass @xmath35 was estimated from the evolutionary tracks of yonsei - yale ( yi et al .",
    "surface gravity @xmath36 was determined via hipparcos parallaxes ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "iron abundance was determined from the equivalent widths measured from a pure stellar spectrum taken with hides ( 50006100 and 60007100 @xmath19 ) combined with the model atmosphere ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "microturbulent velocity were obtained by forcing fe i lines with different strengths to give the same abundances .",
    "we iterated the whole procedure described above until the final metallicity from the measured equivalent widths became consistent with the one input as an initial guess .",
    "finally we got @xmath37}=-0.14\\pm0.09 $ ] and a microturbulent velocity @xmath38 km s@xmath11 .",
    "hd 180314 ( hip 94576 ) is also a k0 iii giant star with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the hipparcos parallax @xmath41 mas yields a distance of 132@xmath2611 pc and @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the atmospheric parameters for the star were derived by the same procedure as described above to be @xmath44 k , @xmath45 , @xmath46 km s@xmath11 , @xmath37}=0.2\\pm0.09 $ ] , and other stellar parameters were @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . although we have not obtained projected rotational velocities for the stars , absorption lines of hd180314 are obviously narrower and deeper than those of hd 145457 , which resulted in better precision in radial velocity measurements for hd 180314 than for hd 145457 even with nearly the same s / n ( see section 5.1 and tables 23 ) .    _ hipparcos _ made a total of 229 and 130 observations of hd 145457 and hd 180314 , respectively , and revealed a photometric stability down to @xmath51 mag for both stars .",
    "ca ii h k lines of hd 145457 show no significant emission in the line cores , but those of hd 180314 show a slight core reversal , suggesting that the star is slightly chromospherically active .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig - cah ] , the reversal of hd 180314 is not significant compared to those of other chromospherically active stars in our sample , such as hd 120048 ( figure [ fig - cah ] ) , which exhibits a velocity scatter of about 20 m s@xmath11 at most .",
    "thus , the intrinsic radial velocity `` jitter '' of hd 180314 is probably expected to be no larger than that of hd 120048 , which is consistent with the rms scatters of the residuals to the keplerian fit for the star ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the observed radial velocities for hd 145457 and hd 180314 are shown in figure [ fig - hd145457 ] and [ fig - hd180314 ] , and are listed in table [ tbl - hd145457 ] and [ fig - hd180314 ] , respectively , together with their estimated uncertainties .",
    "each uncertainty was derived from an ensemble of velocities from individual @xmath52400 spectral segments ( each 3@xmath19 long ) of each exposure .",
    "lomb - scargle periodogram ( scargle 1982 ) of the data for hd 145457 and hd 180314 exhibits a dominant peak at a period of 176 days and 388 days , respectively . false alarm probability ( @xmath53 ) of the peaks were estimated by using a bootstrap randomization method in which the observed radial velocities were randomly redistributed , keeping the observation time fixed .",
    "we generated 10@xmath54 fake datasets in this way , and applied the same periodogram analysis to them . since no fake datasets exhibited a periodogram power higher than the observed ones , the @xmath53s are less than @xmath55 .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbits for the stars were derived from the combined sets of the subaru and oao data using a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm to obtain a minimum chi - squared solution by varying the free parameters ( orbital period , time of periastron passage , eccentricity , velocity amplitude and argument of periastron ) .",
    "no velocity offsets were applied between the subaru and oao data because we used the same stellar template to derive radial velocities ( see in section 2 ) .",
    "the resulting keplerian models are shown in figure [ fig - hd145457 ] and [ fig - hd180314 ] overplotted on the velocities , and their parameters are listed in table [ tbl - planets ] .",
    "the radial velocities of hd 145457 can be well fitted by an orbit with a period @xmath56 days , a velocity semiamplitude @xmath57 m s@xmath11 , and an eccentricity @xmath58 .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals to the keplerian fit was 9.7 m s@xmath11 and the reduced @xmath59 was 1.8 . the uncertainty for each orbital parameter was determined using a bootstrap monte carlo approach , subtracting the theoretical fit , scrambling the residuals , adding the theoretical fit back to the residuals and then refitting . adopting a stellar mass of @xmath60",
    ", we obtain a minimum mass for the companion of @xmath61 and a semimajor axis of @xmath62 au .",
    "the radial velocity variations of hd 180314 can be well reproduced by a keplerian orbit with @xmath63 days , @xmath64 m s@xmath11 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the uncertainty of each parameter was estimated using the same method as described above . adopting a stellar mass of 2.6 @xmath0",
    ", we obtain a minimum mass for the companion @xmath66 and a semimajor axis @xmath67 au .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals to the keplerian fit was 12.9 m s@xmath11 and the reduced @xmath59 was 3.1 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig - hd180314 ] , we found that the residuals showed possible non - random variability .",
    "periodogram analysis for the residuals exhibits a peak around 112 days as shown in figure [ fig - periodgram ] , but the peak is not considered to be significant at this stage because of the high @xmath53 value ( 14% ) .",
    "when we assume the periodicity is originated from rotational modulation , the period corresponds to stellar rotational velocity of about 4 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the value is slightly large compared with those of typical gk giants ( see figure 10 in takeda et al .",
    "2008 ) , but is still possible taking account of the moderate stellar activity of this star .",
    "more frequent observations will enable us to confirm the periodicity and clarify the origin , stellar activity or additional companion .",
    "we performed spectral line shape analysis by using high resolution stellar templates to investigate other possible causes producing apparent radial velocity variations such as pulsation and rotational modulation rather than orbital motion .",
    "for this purpose , we followed a procedure described in sato et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in which we used high resolution i@xmath18-free stellar templates extracted from several star+i@xmath18 spectra .",
    "details of the template extraction technique are described in sato et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    at first , we extracted two stellar templates from five star+i@xmath18 spectra at the peak and valley phases of observed radial velocities for each star .",
    "then , cross correlation profiles of the two templates were calculated for about 80 spectral segments ( 45@xmath19 width each ) in which severely blended lines or broad lines were not included .",
    "three bisector quantities were calculated for the cross correlation profile of each segment : the velocity span ( bvs ) , which is the velocity difference between two flux levels of the bisector ; the velocity curvature ( bvc ) , which is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half and lower half of the bisector ; and the velocity displacement ( bvd ) , which is the average of the bisector at three different flux levels .",
    "we used flux levels of 25% , 50% , and 75% of the cross correlation profile to calculate the above three bisector quantities . as a result ,",
    "both of the bvs and the bvc for the stars were identical to zero , which means that the cross correlation profiles are symmetric , and the average bvd agreed with the velocity difference between the two templates at the peak and valley phases of observed radial velocities ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these results mean that the observed radial velocity variations are due to parallel shifts of the spectral lines and are thus consistent with the planetary hypothesis .",
    "resulting bisector quantities are summarized in table [ tbl - bisector ] .",
    "we here reported the two new substellar companions to k0 iii giants from subaru and oao planet search programs .",
    "the discoveries add to the recent growing population of substellar companions around evolved intermediate - mass stars .",
    "hd 145457 b ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 au ) is one of the innermost planets found around giants .",
    "all the planets currently known around evolved intermediate - mass stars orbit at a@xmath690.6 au ( johnson et al .",
    "2007a ; sato et al .",
    "2008a ; niedzielski et al .",
    "two possible causes of the lack of inner planets has been proposed : they are originally deficient or engulfed by the central stars . in the case of intermediate - mass subgiants ( @xmath70 ) , the former scenario is considered to be appropriate because they are obviously less evolved and have stellar radii of @xmath71 , which means that they could only have engulfed very short - period planets like hot - jupiters ( e.g. johnson et al .",
    "it is not easy , however , to discriminate between the two scenarios in the case of intermediate - mass giants ( typically @xmath72 ) because it is difficult to know accurate evolutionary status of giants .",
    "the inner planets could be tidally engulfed by the central stars at the phase of the tip of red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "thus if we observe giants that have already passed through the tip of rgb , namely core - helium burning stars , we could not find any inner planets around the stars even if the planets originally existed ( sato et al .",
    "2008a ; villaver & livio 2009 ) .",
    "however , it is apparently difficult to distinguish such giants from those ascending rgb for the first time because they locate at nearly the same region on the hr diagram ( red clump region ) .",
    "based on stellar evolutionary models ( cf.evolutionary tracks by girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) , core - helium burning giants stay at the clump region for @xmath52100 times longer than first ascending rgb stars do . therefore ,",
    "if we can collect hundreds of planets around such giants , it will become possible to verify the causes of the lack of inner planets statistically .",
    "hd 180314 b has a minimum mass of 22 @xmath73 and orbits around the central star with 2.6@xmath0 .",
    "this is the 7 th brown - dwarf - mass ( 1380@xmath73 ) companion to evolved intermediate - mass stars ( hatzes et al .",
    "2005 ; lovis & mayor 2007 ; liu et al . 2008 ; omiya et al .",
    "2009 ; niedzielski et al .",
    "actually all of their host stars are estimated to be more massive than 2.5 @xmath0 , suggesting that more massive stars tend to have more massive companions ( lovis & mayor 2007 ; omiya et al .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed for the formation of brown - dwarf - mass companions including gravitational collapse in protostellar clouds like stellar binary systems ( bonnell & bastien 1992 ; bate 2000 ) and gravitational instability in protostellar disks ( boss 2000 ; rice et al .",
    "2003 ) . even by core - accretion scenario in protoplanetary disks , super - massive companions with @xmath74 could be formed on a certain truncation condition for gas accretion ( ida & lin 2004 ; alibert et al .",
    "2004 ; mordasini et al .",
    "if the companions form like stellar binary systems , they are expected to have a wide variety of orbital eccentricity .",
    "the above 7 brown dwarf candidates , however , have relatively low eccentricies of 00.3 , which may be favored by the scenarios that they formed in circumstellar disks and have not experienced significant gravitational interaction with other companions .",
    "one more thing to note here is that metallicity of the host stars of the above brown dwarf candidates are ranging from @xmath75}=-1 $ ] to 0.2 .",
    "although the number of samples is still small , this suggests that the formation mechanism is independent of or less sensitive to metallicity in this range .",
