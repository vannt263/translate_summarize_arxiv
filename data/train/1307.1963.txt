    "magnetic reconnection@xcite is an important and basic mechanism for the magnetic energy conversion in astrophysical and laboratory plasma systems .",
    "it converts the magnetic energy into plasma kinetic and thermal energy , which may account for eruptive phenomena observed both in solar@xcite and the other astrophysical environments@xcite .",
    "recently , plasmoids have been identified in the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) current sheets @xcite , earth s magnetotail@xcite , and in reconnection in laser - produced plasmas@xcite . in resistive magnetohydrodynamic(mhd ) , many numerical simulations@xcite demonstrate that the reconnection process is dominated by the secondary plasmoid instability as the lundquist number exceeds a critical value .",
    "the reconnection rate reaches a high value @xmath4 as large numbers of plasmoid form in the current sheet@xcite .    the critical lundquist number for the occurrence of secondary instabilities is estimated be around @xmath2 according to biskamp s analysis@xcite .",
    "however , one of our previous reduced mhd simulations@xcite with incompressible plasma demonstrated that this critical value is around @xmath5 .",
    "recently@xcite , by solving the 2d compressible mhd equations with different plasmas @xmath0 and lundquist number , we found that the critical lundquist number depends on the initial upstream plasma @xmath0 , it is around @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "the average reconnection rate , normalized to the asymptotic value of upstream @xmath10 is lower in a low @xmath0 system than that in a high @xmath0 system .",
    "since no guide field was included in those simulations and the initial temperature was uniform in all those models , the low @xmath0 at the inflow upstream results in a nonuniform density distribution in the direction that is vertical to the current sheet .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-dependence mentioned above may be largely attributed to the nonuniform initial density distribution .    based on our previous work@xcite , the effects of the initial plasma @xmath0 on the magnetic reconnection process with plasmoid instabilities",
    "are comprehensively studied in this paper .",
    "three models with different guide fields , initial plasmas mass density and temperature distributions are introduced .",
    "simulations with different lundquist number and different initial plasma @xmath0 in the asymptotic inflow region have been performed in the three models .",
    "the characteristics of the current density , the magnetic flux , the reconnection rate and the magnetic energy spectrum along the current sheet during the evolutionary processes of the plasmoid instability are studied .",
    "numerical simulations were carried out with the mhd code nirvana version 3.4@xcite in the 2.5-dimensional cartesian space .    in next section ,",
    "the mhd equations governing the evolution in the system , together with the associated initial conditions are described in detail . in section iii ,",
    "we present the main numerical results in the three models .",
    "discussions and a summary are given in section iv .",
    "as we have described in our previous work@xcite , the dimensionless mhd equations we used in the code are as below : @xmath11    @xmath12 + \\eta \\nabla \\cdot [ \\textbf{b } \\times   ( \\nabla \\times \\textbf{b})],\\ ] ]    @xmath13,\\ ] ]    @xmath14    @xmath15    the variables above are only functions of space in @xmath16 direction and time @xmath17 . the simulation domain is from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath20 in @xmath21-direction and from @xmath18 to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) in @xmath24-direction .",
    "the lundquist number is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the initial asymptotic alfvn speed in the upstream boundary , which is equal to unity in our calculations .",
    "we use three models to describe the initial conditions for our simulations .",
    "each model is incorporated into several different simulations with different lundquist number and initial plasma @xmath0 at the @xmath21 boundary .    in model",
    "i , we start with a harris sheet in the @xmath16 plane and a uniform guide field in the @xmath27-direction : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the width of the harris sheet and is set equal to @xmath30 , which is small enough to allow tearing instabilities to develop@xcite . we choose @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this model .",
    "the initial configuration is in both thermal and mechanical equilibrium , so the initial velocity is zero . from equation(3 ) , the plasma pressure satisfies the initial equilibrium condition :    @xmath33.\\ ] ]    since @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unit vector in @xmath24-direction and @xmath36 is the unit vector in @xmath27-direction , the initial equilibrium gas pressure is calculated as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant . from equation ( 6 ) , we know that @xmath39 at the @xmath21 boundary . since the plasma gas pressure is related to the magnetic pressure by @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial plasma @xmath0 at the @xmath21 boundary . thus : @xmath43 the initial equilibrium state of the total energy is : @xmath44 from the ideal gas law @xmath45 , and the assumption of a uniform temperature , the initial equilibrium mass density and temperature are : @xmath46 respectively . as such , in model i , the initial distributions of gas pressure and mass density depend on the plasma @xmath42 at the inflow boundary .",
    "the lower the @xmath42 , the larger the gradient of the mass density from the center to the inflow boundary .    in model ii ,",
    "the initial distributions of the magnetic fields and gas pressure are the same as in model i , but we use a non - uniform initial distribution of the temperature , which varies with @xmath42 .",
    "the initial mass density is assumed uniform . therefore , the distributions of the initial equilibrium temperature and mass density in model ii are : @xmath47 the lower the @xmath42 , the larger the gradient of the temperature from the center to the inflow boundary .",
    "in model iii , we use nonuniform guide fields in @xmath27-direction .",
    "the distributions of three components of the initial equilibrium guide field are given as below : @xmath48 where @xmath49 . from these expressions",
    ", one can notice that @xmath50 .",
    "the width of the harris sheet @xmath29 is still set to equal @xmath30 in this model . as we have described in model i , from equation(7 ) , we can get the initial pressure : @xmath51 hence , the initial equilibrium gas pressure is uniform , and the initial equilibrium state of the total energy is : @xmath52 in this model , we assume that both the initial equilibrium density and temperature are uniform : @xmath53 therefore , the lower the @xmath42 , the lower the temperature and gas pressure in the whole simulation domain .    in fig.1 , we present the initial equilibrium conditions along the @xmath21-direction in the three models for the case of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in all three models ,",
    "the following perturbation is added to the magnetic field :    @xmath56    @xmath57    a constant value @xmath58 is used in our simulations , which is the same as that used in our previous paper@xmath59}$ ] .",
    "we use periodic boundary condition in @xmath24-direction and neumann boundary condition in @xmath21-direction .",
    "the highest lundquist number we have tested is @xmath60 in this work .",
    "the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique is used in the code , and we start the simulation with a base level grid of @xmath61 . the highest refinement level in our experiment is 8 , which corresponds to a grid resolution @xmath62 .",
    "convergence studies have been carried out to test the cases @xmath63 and @xmath64 in all of the three models with a lower refinement level of 7 , corresponding to a grid resolution of @xmath65 .",
    "the reconnection rate is similar to the higher resolution run with @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the grid resolution in our simulations is sufficiently high to suppress the numerical resistivity .",
    "as we have demonstrated clearly in our previous paper@xcite , the critical lundquist number for the onset of the plasmoid instability depends on @xmath42 .",
    "however , this @xmath42 dependence could be largely attributed to the density variation .",
    "the reconnection processes with different lundquist number and plasma @xmath42 have been studied numerically in all of the three different models which have been described in section ii .",
    "table 1 presents the simulations with different initial @xmath42 and lundquist number @xmath67 that we have carried out in this paper .",
    "for example , in model i for @xmath64 , we have simulated the reconnection process for @xmath68 .",
    "no secondary instabilities appear for @xmath69 , and secondary plasmoids start to appear when @xmath70 . therefore , the critical lundquist number is between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 in model i. by using the same methods , the critical lundquist number is found between @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath55 in model i. in model ii , the critical lundquist number is found between @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath54 , and this critical value becomes @xmath78 for @xmath55 . in model iii , we find that the critical lundquist number is around @xmath79 to @xmath80 for @xmath54 , and that the critical value for @xmath55 is between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the critical lundquist number for the occurrence of secondary instabilities depends on the initial plasma @xmath42 at the inflow boundary .",
    "this critical value is usually higher in the lower @xmath42 case . in model",
    "i with non - uniform initial mass density , this phenomenon is more obvious , the critical lundquist number is around an order of magnitude higher for @xmath54 than that for @xmath55 . in model ii and iii ,",
    "the initial mass density are both uniform in the two models , this critical value is no more than two times higher for @xmath54 than that in the @xmath55 case .    in the following part of this section , the time dependent reconnection rate , the evolution of the current density and magnetic flux , the magnetic and the kinetic energy spectrum along the current sheet are demonstrated in different models with different @xmath42 .",
    "the reconnection rate @xmath81 is calculated using the same method as we have described in our previous paper@xcite , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the magnetic flux function at the main reconnection @xmath85 point ( where the separatrices separating the two open field line regions intersect ) and the @xmath86 point .",
    "the method used to get the magnetic and kinetic energy spectrum @xmath87 is also the same as we have used previously .",
    "fig.3 shows the evolution of the current density and magnetic flux with @xmath88 for different models .",
    "since the current sheets are very thin for such a high lundquist number , in order to see the details inside the current sheet clearly , the plots are stretched in the @xmath21-direction and only the simulation domain from @xmath89 to @xmath90 in @xmath21-direction is presented .",
    "hence , the real current sheets are much thinner than the plots presented in fig.3 . from fig.3(a ) and fig.3(b ) , one can see that the secondary magnetic islands appear earlier and the secondary current sheets are thinner for @xmath91 case than that for the @xmath64 in model i. the current density at the reconnection @xmath85-points is also higher for @xmath55 during the later stage of the secondary instability process . in model ii and iii ,",
    "the whole reconnection process with secondary instabilities is very similar for the @xmath55 case and the @xmath54 case , we only present the results of model iii in fig.3(c ) and fig.3(d ) here . as we know , the smaller the @xmath42 , the higher the gradient of the mass density from the center to the inflow boundary in model i , and the higher the temperature gradient from the center to the inflow boundary in model ii .",
    "therefore , the effects of the initial @xmath42 on the secondary plasmoid instability with high lundquist number is essentially decided by the distribution of the initial mass density .",
    "these results indicate that the non - uniform distribution of the initial mass density in @xmath85-direction can strongly affect the secondary plasmoid instability .",
    "the influence of the initial temperature on this process , however , is not apparent .    for @xmath64 and @xmath88 ,",
    "the time dependent magnetic energy spectral index @xmath92 along the current sheet in the three models is presented in fig.4 .",
    "the value of @xmath92 is calculated using the same way as we have described in our previous paper : the magnetic field components @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 along the reconnection layer in the center ( @xmath96 ) are selected .",
    "they are then transformed to fourier space as @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and the magnetic energy spectrum @xmath100 is obtained as @xmath101 .",
    "finally , we fit the power spectrum @xmath100 to a power law @xmath102 to obtain the magnetic energy spectral index @xmath92 .",
    "we only choose the region before @xmath100 drops to a value that is five magnitudes smaller than the maximum value .",
    "for example , if the maximum @xmath100 is @xmath103 , we just fit a line to get the spectral index @xmath92 within the region @xmath104 .",
    "because the spectrum does not necessarily follow a power law , the value of @xmath92 we get here is an average value at each time step .",
    "fig.4 shows that the spectral index @xmath92 decreases with time , eventually they settle down to approximately 2 in all the three models . as we have found in our previous paper@xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath92 measures how smooth the current sheet is .",
    "when @xmath92 starts to decrease , it means that the finer structures begin to appear inside the reconnection layer .",
    "our results show that @xmath92 decreases faster in model ii and iii than in model i , which is consistent with the phenomena we observed in fig.3(a ) and fig.3(c ) that the secondary current sheets start to appear earlier in model iii than in model i for the same @xmath42 .",
    "fig.5 presents the magnetic and kinetic energy spectrum before and after secondary islands appear in model i for @xmath105 , @xmath54 . at @xmath106 , the spectral index for both magnetic and kinetic energy is high , which means that these two kinds of energy can only be cascaded to a large scale at this time point . at @xmath107 ,",
    "the secondary islands already appear , the value of @xmath92 is only around @xmath108 for the magnetic energy spectrum and @xmath109 for the kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "the spectral index is set by the formation of islands on small scales , the growth of islands through    different from the model in our previous paper , the guide field is included in all the three models in this work , and the effect of the initial non - uniform and uniform temperature distributions on the plasmoid instability have been studied systematically here .",
    "though the guide field in model ii and model iii is different , the numerical experiment results for these two models are very similar .",
    "the above results for model i are also very similar to some results in the pure two dimensional model@xcite . therefore , in the mhd scale , we can conclude that the effect of the guide field is not significant in the plasmoid instability process we have studied here",
    ". however , these guide field could be very important for particle acceleration@xcite .",
    "guide fields have been found to be very important during kinetic simulations@xcite , which have shown that the strength of the guide field controls whether or not secondary magnetic islands can appear during magnetic reconnection@xcite .",
    "@xmath110 + & & @xmath111 + modeli & @xmath112 & @xmath113 + & @xmath114 & @xmath113 + & @xmath115 & @xmath116 + & @xmath73 & @xmath117 + & & @xmath118 + modelii & @xmath119 & @xmath120 + & @xmath114 & @xmath121 + & @xmath115 & @xmath122 + & @xmath73 & @xmath123 + & & @xmath124 + modeliii & @xmath119 & @xmath120 + & @xmath125 & @xmath126 + & @xmath115 & @xmath127 +",
    "based on the 2.5 dimensional mhd numerical experiment , we have studied the effects of the initial distribution of mass density , temperature , and plasma @xmath42 at the inflow boundary on the plasmoid instability during magnetic reconnection .",
    "the standard harris sheet profile was used to establish an initial configuration in equilibrium , and a small perturbation makes the harris sheet unstable and evolve to a thinner sweet - parker current sheet with shearing flows .",
    "different from our previous paper , uniform and non - uniform guide fields are included in three different models with different initial mass density and temperature profiles .",
    "the main results and conclusions are : ( 1 ) no matter whether the lundquist number is high or low , the non - uniform distribution of the mass density along the @xmath21-direction that is vertical to the current sheet strongly affects the plasmoid instability process .",
    "the high plasma mass density gradient from the center to the inflow boundary can result in a low plasma @xmath42 at the inflow upstream region .",
    "the higher the plasma density at the center is , the lower the plasma @xmath42 is . for this kind of initial density profile",
    ", we find that : ( a ) for the same lundquist number , the magnetic reconnection rate is lower for the lower @xmath42 case . as we have pointed out in our previous paper@xcite , when the low @xmath42 system is disturbed by the initial perturbations , it might be more difficult to push the dense plasma in the current sheet to the downstream region , leading to a slower reconnection rate .",
    "( b ) as the lundquist number is high enough , the secondary instability appears earlier , the secondary current sheets are thinner and the current density at the main x - point is higher for a higher @xmath42 case . ( 2 ) when the initial density profile is uniform in the whole magnetic reconnection domain , the different plasma @xmath42 at the inflow boundary corresponds to the different temperature profile .",
    "opposite to the non - unform initial density profile model , for the same low lundquist number , the magnetic reconnection rate in the lower @xmath42 case can increase to a higher valuer , which agrees well with the analysis results of hesse @xmath128 @xmath129.@xcite and birn @xmath128 @xmath129.@xcite .",
    "increasing of the lundquist number weakens the effects of the non - uniform initial temperature distribution on the plasmoid instability .",
    "as secondary instability appears , the effects of @xmath42 induced by the different non - uniform temperature distributions can be ignored .",
    "( 3 ) without considering the particle acceleration , the impact of the property of the guide field on the plasmoid instability process is not apparent on the mhd scale , which is very different from the results of the kinetic simulations@xcite . in 2.5d resistive mhd ,",
    "the guide field acts mostly like an additional pressure term . for cases with nonuniform initial mass density ( such as our previous paper@xcite and this one ) , plasma pressure effects do change the onset and dynamics of the plasmoid instability , but the effects do not lead to any significant qualitative differences .",
    "there are quantitative differences including the onset criterion .",
    "however , for the case of uniform initial mass density , plasma pressure effects do not even lead to many significant quantitative differences for high lundquist number cases ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "kinetic simulations include the hall effect , which can lead to symmetry breaking and current sheet tilting and similar effects for islands .",
    "consequently , adding in a guide field to kinetic simulations leads to qualitatively different results .",
    "additionally , particle - in - cell simulations are generally somewhat noisy , which may contribute to more efficient island formation .    in the 2.5 resistive mhd ,",
    "the guide field acts mostly like an additional pressure term . for the cases with nonuniform initial mass density ,",
    "our previous paper@xcite and this one , do show that plasma pressure effects do change the onset and dynamics of the plasmoid instabiity , but the effects do nt lead to many qualitative differences .",
    "the onset criterion is changed and there are quantitative differences . however , for the case with uniform mass density , plasma pressure effects can not even lead to many quantitative effects for the high lundquist number case ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "probably the most important new effect in kinetic simulations is the hall effect .",
    "the hall effect can lead to symmetry breaking for current sheets so that they end up tilting , and can also have similar effects on islands .",
    "the important thing is that adding in a guide field to kinetic simulations leads to qualitatively different results .",
    "additionally , pic simulations are generally somewhat noisy , which may contribute to more efficient island formation .    though the guide fields are included , the simulations are basically carried out in the two dimensional space . as we know , the topological structure of the magnetic reconnection process in the real three dimensional space is very different from that in 2.5 dimensional",
