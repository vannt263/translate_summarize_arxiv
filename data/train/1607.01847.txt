    "inflation can be regarded as magnifier which allows us to probe microscopic world , namely , high energy physics through the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies or the large scale structures of the universe .",
    "indeed , it is important to explore high energy physics such as string theory by means of inflation .",
    "it is known that there are a lot of scalar fields called axions and gauge fields in string theory .",
    "it should be noted that an axion is one of the best - motivated candidates of an inflaton since it naturally gives rise to a nearly flat potential protected by its shift symmetry @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic feature of axionic inflation is that it gets correction of the form of the periodic potential due to quantum non - perturbative effects such as instantons .",
    "specific examples are the axion monodromy mechanism @xcite or a kind of aligned natural inflation motivated by the weak gravity conjecture @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this kind of potential gives the small modulation to the scalar power spectrum .",
    "thus , the oscillatory feature in the power - spectrum is intimately related to fundamental physics .",
    "intriguingly , although the oscillation in the scalar spectrum has been often discussed  @xcite , the oscillation in the tensor spectrum has been overlooked .",
    "this is because , on the cmb scales , the oscillation amplitude in the tensor spectrum is suppressed by several orders of magnitude compared to that in scalar spectrum .",
    "however , it is worth seeking the possibility of this oscillatory signature in the tensor spectrum on the scales probed by future space - based gravitational wave experiments such as decigo @xcite and bbo @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the possibility of generating primordial gravitational waves ( pgws ) with oscillatory features in axionic inflation . specifically , we focus on two types of axionic inflations : one is single - field axion monodromy inflation and the other is a variant of inflation driven by the axion coupled to su(2 ) gauge field , called aligned chromo - natural inflation @xcite .",
    "these two models are quite different from the point of the mechanism of producing tensor spectra . in the case of single - field monodromy inflation ,",
    "the tensor spectrum comes from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "we see that it is difficult to detect the oscillatory feature from single - field monodromy inflation since the amplitude of oscillation is suppressed by the factor of slow - roll parameters and sub - planckian decay constant . on the other hand , in the case of aligned chromo - natural inflation",
    ", the tachyonic growth of one helicity mode of the gauge field produces chiral pgws during inflation @xcite .",
    "we find that the tensor mode due to particle production of gauge field is sensitive to the modulation of inflaton potential and it produces detectable oscillatory feature in the tensor spectrum even for the tiny modulation .",
    "this feature will open up a new window to physics in early universe through the chiral gravitational waves .",
    "first , we consider the single - field axionic monodromy inflation .",
    "the action reads @xmath0 \\ , \\ ] ] where  @xmath1  is planck mass ,  @xmath2  is ricci scalar and  @xmath3  is an axion . for the inflaton potential ,",
    "we use the following form with small modulation generated by the so - called monodromy mechanism in string theory @xcite @xmath4 \\     \\label{eq : v1 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath5  is the bare potential and  @xmath6 is the modulation . the parameters  @xmath7  are constant and  @xmath8 characterizes the size of modulation generated by instanton effects . in the cosine potential ,",
    "@xmath9  is a sub - planckian decay constant of axion and  @xmath10  is a model - dependent phase factor . due to this periodic modulation",
    ", we can expect the oscillatory feature in the power spectra .",
    "let us consider the background dynamics with the modulation .",
    "the axion obeys the following slow - roll equations @xmath11 note that the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time  @xmath12  and  @xmath13  means the 1st ( 2nd ) order derivative of potential with respect to  @xmath3 .",
    "we can define a new variable  @xmath14  to parametrizes the strength of the modulation .",
    "we treat this as a small parameter during inflation in order to ensure that the inflaton does not get trapped .",
    "namely , the slope of the bare potential must be larger than that of the modulation  @xmath15 ,  which implies @xmath16 . defining the bare potential slow - roll parameters @xmath17",
    "the total slow - roll parameters are expressed by @xmath18 we can see that  @xmath19  is suppressed relative to  @xmath20  by a factor  @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the spectral index of scalar spectrum  @xmath22  is more sensitive to the modulation of the potential compared to that of tensor spectrum  @xmath23 . according to the current cmb constraint on  @xmath24 , the amplitude of  @xmath25  at the pivot scale has an upper bound  @xmath26  for  @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the tensor spectrum with the small oscillation is given by @xmath28_{k = ah } \\label{eq : tensor } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath29  is the amplitude of tensor spectrum with no oscillation .",
    "note that  @xmath30  is evaluated when a mode with  @xmath31  exits the horizon .",
    "solving slow - roll equations with no modulation , we can approximate  @xmath30  as @xmath32 where  @xmath33  is evaluated at the pivot scale  @xmath34 .",
    "the second term in the tensor spectrum stems from the modulation of the potential . compared to the scalar spectrum ,",
    "its amplitude is suppressed by a factor  @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we suspect that its effect is almost invisible with gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "next , we consider the effect of modulation on the chromo - natural inflation model .",
    "the action is as follows : @xmath35 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath36  is the field strength of su(2 ) gauge field @xmath37 .",
    "note that  @xmath38 is the index of su(2 ) inner space ,  @xmath39  is levi - civita symbol and  @xmath40  is a gauge coupling constant . as a background gauge condition , we choose the temporal gauge  @xmath41  and take an ansatz @xmath42 which is invariant under the diagonal transformation of the spatial rotation so(3 ) and the su(2 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "note that  @xmath43  is scale factor . in chern - simons term , the dual field strength is defined as @xmath44 , where  @xmath45  is antisymmetric tensor . in this model",
    "we suppose the coupling constant  @xmath46  is much larger than one . then defining new variables",
    "@xmath47 , if  @xmath48  and  @xmath49  hold , we get the following slow - roll equations @xmath50    for the axion potential with modulation , we use @xmath51 + \\lambda_{\\text{mod}}^4 \\left [ 1 - \\cos \\left ( \\dfrac{\\varphi}{f_{\\text{mod } } } + \\delta \\right ) \\right ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we defined the energy scale of the bare potential with @xmath52 and parameters of modulation  @xmath53 .",
    "note that above potential form is motivated by instanton effects including a series of higher harmonics terms or knp mechanism taking into account the weak gravity conjecture @xcite .",
    "then we get the modified slow - roll equation for  @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 remarkably , the attractor of the gauge field evolves with oscillation due to the modulation of potential .",
    "again ,  @xmath25  must be small in order to complete inflation . using the slow roll equation , the time variation of  @xmath54",
    "is approximated by @xmath57 where we neglected the time variation of  @xmath58  because of the slow - roll conditions .",
    "thus , we can expect that this modulation gives an oscillatory feature to the tensor spectrum in this model .    as is well known , one of helicity modes of the gauge field experiences tachyonic instability around horizon crossing in the presence of the parity violating axion coupling .",
    "the instability generates parity - violating metric fluctuations at the linear level @xcite .",
    "thus , the chiral tensor spectra are approximately given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 \\label{eq : gw+ } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we defined the following enhancement factor @xcite @xmath61 where we have @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 and new variables  @xmath66  and  @xmath67 note that this spectrum depends on  @xmath68  exponentially and is easily enhanced as  @xmath68  increases .",
    "so we get a sizable modulation even if  @xmath25  is small . in fig.[fig :",
    "chimodu ] , we plotted the energy spectra as a function of the frequency in a decigo and bbo range  @xmath69 .",
    "we can see that the spectrum of the positive chirality mode @xmath70 is enhanced and show oscillation . in this plot , we used the following approximate solution of the inflaton derived from @xmath71 and chose  @xmath72 .    here , one might worry about the scalar spectrum .",
    "however , scalar modes of gauge field are stable if  @xmath73  is satisfied . in this region",
    ", the curvature power spectrum is approximately given by @xcite @xmath74 where  @xmath75  is a numerical function which decreases as  @xmath68  increases .",
    "therefore the effect of modulation is not so sensitive for the scalar power spectrum .",
    "( blue line ) ,  @xmath76  ( green line ) and  @xmath77  ( light gray line ) .",
    "we set  @xmath78  in this plot .",
    ", width=264,height=188 ]",
    "now , we estimate the detectable parameter @xmath25 from its estimation error by using the correlation analysis with gravitational wave interferometers such as decigo and bbo .",
    "firstly , we consider the data stream  @xmath79  of @xmath80-th detector in fourier space which consists of the signal of gravitational waves  @xmath81  and detector noise  @xmath82 , @xmath83 where the index  @xmath84  labels each interferometer in two triangle clusters . here , we consider two effectively @xmath85-shaped interferometers in each cluster whose noises are identical with no correlation each other @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that the amplitude of  @xmath81  is much smaller than that of  @xmath82 .",
    "the signal is related to the metric tensor modes as @xmath86 where  @xmath87  is the direction angle of arrival of the wave and  @xmath88  is the pattern function of the @xmath80-th detector which includes the geometrical information of detectors .",
    "note that we set the generic point at the center of star - like detector :  @xmath89 .",
    "for the stochastic background of gravitational waves , the ensemble average of the fourier amplitude is given by @xcite @xmath90 @xmath91 where  @xmath92  is the present hubble constant and  @xmath93  is the energy density parameter of the gravitational waves at present . note that  @xmath94  is the dimensionless hubble parameter . with the relation @xmath95 ,  @xmath93 can be expressed by the tensor spectrum as @xmath96 @xcite . as to the noise variables , they have no correlation between different detectors so that their spectrum can be written as @xmath97 the noise spectrum of decigo and bbo is approximately given by @xcite @xmath98 \\notag \\\\     & & + 4.45\\times10^{-51}\\left(\\dfrac{f}{1~\\text{hz}}\\right)^{-4}\\dfrac{1}{1 + \\left(\\tfrac{f}{7.36~\\text{hz}}\\right)^2 } \\notag \\\\   & & + 4.94\\times10^{-52}\\left(\\dfrac{f}{1~\\text{hz}}\\right)^{-4}\\text{hz}^{-1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath99    next , we define the following correlation of data streams @xmath100 where  @xmath101  is the width of frequency segments . since the noises in different detectors have no correlation , the mean value  @xmath102  includes only the signal of gravitational waves .",
    "then , we get @xmath103 where  @xmath104  is the time interval of observation . here",
    ", we define the overlap reduction function of two detectors as @xmath105 for isotropic modes , we can set  @xmath106  for two co - aligned detectors .",
    "on the other hand , the amount of noise is larger than gw signal , so its variance  @xmath107  in fourier mode is approximated by @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath109 ) of the stochastic gravitational wave background is given by @xmath110 \\label{eq : fi } \\ .\\ ] ] the summation in is taken with respect to the number of independent detectors of decigo and bbo .",
    "the frequency range is set to  @xmath111  and  @xmath112  in order to avoid the binary confusion noise .",
    "now , we can discuss the detectability of oscillation .",
    "we assume that the fiducial parameter of  @xmath25  is zero .",
    "then the amplitude of the parameter estimation error  @xmath113  is evaluated by fisher information quantity  @xmath114  given by the inverse of the error correlation @xcite @xmath115 \\label{eq : fisher } \\ .\\ ] ] thus , we can say that oscillation in the spectrum is detectable if @xmath25 satisfies the inequality @xmath116      we firstly estimate the parameter sensitivity of singe - field version of axion monodromy inflation . for simplicity , in our calculation we choose",
    "@xmath72  and  @xmath117 . in order to see the oscillation",
    ", we need to increase the decay constant of axion . however , in order to have oscillation on the inflaton trajectory the decay constant must be smaller than the variation of inflaton  @xmath118  during inflation @xmath119 , that is , @xmath120 thus , we have an upper bound on the dacay constant .",
    "hence , for the detectability , we obtained the bound @xmath121 where we set the axion decay constant  @xmath122 .",
    "therefore ,  @xmath25 must be large in order to get a detectable oscillatory feature , which is not compatible with the requirement of completion of inflation .",
    "next , we estimate the parameter sensitivity to modulation in aligned chromo - natural inflation . here , we are interested in the parameter region where chiral gws are sufficiently enhanced . in this region , we can approximate  @xmath123  as a real number with a constant complex phase , so that @xmath124 is held . using this approximation in , we calculated the signal to noise ratio and the estimation error for various  @xmath125  values .",
    "we found that  @xmath113  becomes sufficiently small as  @xmath68  increases .",
    "this is because we get large  @xmath109  as  @xmath68  increases and the tensor spectrum is exponentially sensitive to @xmath68 .",
    "more concretely , we get the following lower bound @xmath126 where we set  @xmath127 . therefore , in the case of aligned chromo - natural inflation",
    ", we can conclude that the oscillation of gravitational waves is detectable by decigo or bbo .",
    "we studied the oscillatory feature of tensor spectrum from axionic inflation . in the case of single - field monodromy inflation ,",
    "the modulation in tensor spectrum is too small to be detected by decigo or bbo . on the other hand , in the case of aligned chromo - natural inflation , we can get the sizable modulation in one helicity mode of tensor perturbation sourced by the gauge field which experienced the tachyonic instability around horizon crossing during inflation .",
    "thus , we found the possibility of producing sizable oscillatory feature in the tensor spectrum of chiral gravitational waves from axionic inflations when axion couples to the gauge field during inflation .    in this work , we discussed the tensor spectrum with a sizable oscillation produced by non - abelian gauge field in chromo - natural inflation .",
    "it is known that it is difficult to reconcile the original chromo - natural model with cmb data because it yields too large red scalar spectral index or too much chiral gws .",
    "however , it is possible to improve the model so that chromo - natural inflation occurs in a frequency range higher than nhz and cmb constraints can be satisfied  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can expect the sizable modulation in the tensor spectrum in the case of abelian gauge field because one helicity mode of gauge field produces tensor modes at the non - linear level @xcite .",
    "we leave these issues for future work .",
    "we would like to thank t.tanaka and n.seto for fruitful advice and discussion .",
