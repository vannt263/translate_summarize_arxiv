    "@xcite and @xcite have estimated that fast radio bursts radiate as much as @xmath1 ergs and set lower bounds on their radiated power as high as @xmath2 ergs / s ( because only upper bounds on their intrinsic durations have been measured , their instantaneous power can only be bounded from below ) .",
    "these values are derived from their observed fluences and the assumptions of cosmological distances and ( at least roughly ) isotropic emission .",
    "distances are estimated by attributing frb dispersions to intergalactic plasma in standard cosmology .",
    "the inferred brightness temperatures are nearly as high as the highest astronomical brightness temperatures ever measured , those of the nanoshots of two galactic pulsars @xcite .",
    "the evidence for cosmological distances is compelling @xcite , but the assumption of isotropic emission has only simplicity and the lack of contrary evidence to support it . the high powers it implies pose demanding constraints @xcite on models @xcite that attribute frb to supergiant pulses from neutron stars with physical processes like those of radio pulsars .",
    "these models would otherwise be attractive because they would naturally explain ( assuming similar physical processes , that unfortunately are not understood ) the coherent emission with extraordinary brightness temperatures of frb .",
    "these high brightness temperatures also impose demanding constraints on models @xcite of the emission mechanisms themselves .    in this paper",
    "i consider a hypothesis opposite to that of isotropic emission .",
    "suppose frb radiate a steady power , but concentrate it into a beam of solid angle @xmath3 that sweeps or wanders in direction , and only intercepts the observer a fraction @xmath4 of the time , where @xmath4 is the empirical duty factor .",
    "@xmath4 may be roughly considered the fraction of the time the frb is `` on '' , and is more formally defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the observed flux ( or spectral density ) .",
    "the duty factors of several non - repeating frb are roughly estimated @xmath7 @xcite , but the repeating frb 121102 @xcite has @xmath4 as large as @xmath8 .",
    "if the emission is steady and if the direction of emission is randomly and statistically isotropically distributed on the sky , the emission must be collimated into a solid angle @xmath9 the instantaneous power is less by a factor @xmath4 than it would be if isotropic emission were assumed , but the brightness temperature , inferred from the measured flux density , the distance and the source size , is the same .",
    "the requirement of coherent emission is not relaxed , but the energetic constraints are mitigated .",
    "i follow the analysis of @xcite , but assume steady emission collimated into the solid angle @xmath3 .",
    "the most luminous frb radiated a power @xcite @xmath10 into a solid angle @xmath11 in a pulse of equivalent isotropic energy @xmath12 ergs with a ( not measured ) unbroadened duration @xmath13s and duty factor @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath4 is crudely bounded from limits on repetition of frb other than the known repeater frb 121102 @xcite .",
    "frb 121102 has a larger @xmath15 but its outbursts were much fainter than the most intense bursts reported by @xcite , so the inferred mean @xmath16 is similar .    the power that can be emitted by a magnetic dipole rotating at an angular frequency @xmath17 s@xmath18 , assuming the dipole axis is perpendicular to the spin axis , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an unknown efficiency of conversion of spin energy into radio - frequency energy .",

    "combining eqs .",
    "[ power][moment ] yields @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25s is the mean interval between bursts .",
    "@xmath4 is the duty factor describing the actual burst duration at the source ; the measured duration may be longer because of instrumental response and propagation broadening .",
    "using the empirical lower bound of @xmath26s on the spindown time of frb 121102 ( recognizing that this may not be applicable to other , more luminous , frb ) yields @xmath27 these constraints are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ constraints ] .",
    "constraints on magnetic field and spin rate in pulsar models of frb .",
    "the region at the upper right is excluded by the condition that the spindown time not be less than 3 y , the duration over which the repetitions of frb 121102 have been observed @xcite .",
    "the heavily hatched region below and to the left of the line @xmath28 is excluded for narrowly beamed , randomly and isotropically slewing , steady emitters with @xmath29 , corresponding to the most energetic observed burst with duration @xmath30ms , efficiency @xmath31 and duty factor @xmath32 , equivalent to a mean power of @xmath33 ergs / s .",
    "the hatched region below and to the left of the line @xmath34 is excluded for isotropic emitters with @xmath35 , corresponding to the most energetic observed burst if it had duration @xmath30ms and efficiency @xmath31 .",
    "both factors in the denominator , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are @xmath38 because only upper limits to the intrinsic burst durations are measured and the efficiency of turning rotational energy into a radio burst must be @xmath38 .",
    "if the bursts are unbeamed then the spindown power @xmath39ergs / s for the most luminous burst , confining the possible parameters to the narrow unhatched region .",
    "if they are strongly beamed the wide swath between the @xmath28 and @xmath34 lines is possible , provided the efficiency @xmath37 and duration in ms @xmath40 are not small.,width=288 ]    combining eqs .",
    "[ dipoleparams ] and [ spindown ] yields an upper bound on the spin period , corresponding to the lower bound on @xmath41 of the allowed region in fig .",
    "[ constraints ] @xmath42 for beamed emission with @xmath32 periods as long as 100 s may bei allowed , provided the magnetic field is large enough and depending on values of the other parameters , but for isotropic emission @xmath43s .",
    "even if frb are produced by objects like radio pulsars ( non - accreting magnetic neutron stars ) , it is implausible that frb parameters are in the range of those of known galactic radio pulsars that do not make frb ( or do so too rarely to have been observed ) .",
    "comparing known pulsar parameters to the constraints on frb pulsar parameters may give some insight into what nature may provide the modeler .",
    "catalogued pulsars @xcite have values of @xmath44 in the range @xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "many pulsars would satisfy inequalities ( [ dipoleparams ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) if the product of the dimensionless parameters were very roughly @xmath0 , but all would fail by several orders of magnitude for isotropic emission .",
    "values of @xmath37 , tacitly assuming isotropic emission , in the range @xmath47@xmath48 are found in the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite , if the luminosity is evaluated at 400 mhz with an assumed bandwidth of 400 mhz and is averaged over the pulse cycle .",
    "the value of @xmath37 corresponding to the peak of the pulse is likely to be an order of magnitude higher .",
    "however , these results can not be directly applied to the steady - source model of frb because that model requires a narrowly collimated beam .",
    "the peak nanoshot luminosities of psr b1937 + 21 @xcite and of the crab pulsar @xcite , assuming isotropic emission , roughly equal their spindown powers .",
    "this would imply @xmath49 , but the assumption of isotropic emission would make that value of @xmath37 inapplicable to steady - source ( beamed ) models of frb .",
    "@xcite , assuming isotropic emission , inferred a radiation energy density in the nanoshots of psr b1937 + 21 that exceeded ( if they were emitted from a region of dimension @xmath50 cm ) the plasma energy density by a factor of @xmath51 , and that was even greater than the magnetostatic energy density .",
    "this is implausible : a pulsar can radiate its rotational energy only at the dipole radiation rate and the radiation poynting vector is distributed over the open field lines .",
    "they cover a fraction @xmath52@xmath53 of the surface of a fast pulsar ( @xmath54ms ) like b1937 + 21 , so that only @xmath55 of the spindown power flows through the apparent @xmath56 cm source region ( @xmath57ns ) of the nanoshot .",
    "the spindown power flowing through the apparent source region is several orders of magnitude less than the inferred ( isotropic ) radiated power .",
    "it is implausible that a nanoshot could be powered by the neutron star s magnetic energy because this can only be tapped by magnetic reconnection .",
    "this occurs in young high field neutron stars ( `` magnetars '' ) and is observed as soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "these emit thermal x - rays at temperatures of tens of kev , unlike the coherent radio emission of nanoshots or frb .",
    "a plausible resolution of this energy dilemma is that the nanoshots are highly collimated , reducing the radiation energy density , perhaps by many orders of magnitude , compared to that implied by isotropic emission .",
    "they may be galactic exemplars of the highly collimated pulsar emission that this paper hypothesizes for frb , though frb are @xmath58 times as energetic as the nanoshots ( that have @xmath59 of the fluence of frb and are @xmath60 times as distant ) . despite this enormous difference of energy scale ,",
    "the brightness temperatures of nanoshots and frb are within about two orders of magnitude of each other , suggesting a similarity .",
    "in nature , collimated radiation is only produced by collimated beams of relativistic particles .",
    "radiation is generally broadly distributed in angle ( for example , in a dipole radiation pattern ) in the instantaneous rest frames of the emitting particles , and lorentz transformation to the observer s frame collimates it to an angle @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the emitters lorentz factor . in the laboratory collimated radiation",
    "is produced by engineered structures ( laser cavity mirrors , lenses , absorbing collimators _ etc . _ ) , but these are not likely to occur naturally .",
    "intensity spikes may occur at caustics , but in propagation through turbulent media many individual ray paths add randomly and the intensity has a rayleigh distribution .",
    "intensities orders of magnitude greater than the mean are exponentially rare .",
    "collimation to a fraction @xmath4 of the sphere indicates emission by relativistic particles with lorentz factors @xmath63 if the particles ( and radiation ) are confined to a thin but broad sheet ( such as a surface of constant magnetic latitude ; such structures are observed in auror ) and lorentz factors @xmath64 if the particles and radiation form a pencil beam .",
    "the observed duty factors of frb suggest @xmath65@xmath66 for sheeds and @xmath67@xmath68 for pencil beams .",
    "if repeating frb can be shown to be periodically modulated their production by rotating neutron stars will be demonstrated .",
    "the values of the period and its rate of change will distinguish pulsar from sgr models and determine their parameters .",
    "phasing the bursts of repeating frb may detect periodicity _ provided _ their emission is modulated by their rotation as well as by the wandering that produces rare and sporadic bursts when the assumed narrow beam points in our direction .",
    "such periodic modulation is certainly plausible ( it is the characteristic signature of classic radio pulsars ) , but by no means certain .",
    "it might manifest itself in a periodogram of the epochs of observed bursts .",
    "suppose we observe @xmath69 bursts from a frb in a time @xmath70 and wish to search for modulation frequencies over a bandwidth @xmath71 ( typically from 0 to @xmath71 ) .",
    "if all pulses are equally strong ( deviations from this will reduce the effective value of @xmath69 ) and all observable pulses occur at the same rotational phase of the pulsar then the effective number of independent samples ( independent elements of a periodogram ) is about @xmath72 .",
    "if the observed pulse times are distributed as shot noise ( the null hypothesis of no periodic modulation ) then the elements of the periodogram have a gaussian distribution ( if @xmath73 ) with mean @xmath74 and standard deviation @xmath75 .",
    "if the pulses are exactly periodic the value of the element of the periodogram corresponding to that period is @xmath69 . in order to have a probability @xmath76 of a false positive period ,",
    "@xmath69 must satisfy @xmath77 for an observing run with @xmath78s ( about 6 hours ) , @xmath79s and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 detection ) @xmath82 is required . for @xmath83 ( @xmath84 detection )",
    "@xmath85 is required .",
    "these values are about an order of magnitude greater than those detected by @xcite and @xcite in their studies of the repeating frb 121102 , but small enough that it is plausible that sufficiently many pulses will be observed in the future , perhaps by fast or ska , more sensitive than any existing instruments .",
    "these estimates assume a constant pulse period , a good approximation for @xmath86day , even for rapidly slowing pulsars .",
    "however , for data scattered over many days it may be necessary to allow for spin - down @xmath87 , and perhaps even higher derivatives ; the phase @xmath88 this increases the dimensionality of the parameter space to be searched and the required number of detected pulses increases rapidly",
    ". timing noise can make it impossible to detect underlying periodicity because then the series [ phase ] does not converge .",
    "this may occur when the detected signal consists , as for frb and rrat , of rare but accurately timed pulses rather than , as for most radio pulsars , a continuously modulated periodic signal .",
    "the assumption that frb emit roughly isotropically with a very low duty factor represents one end of a continuum . in rotation - powered pulsars there is no energy reservoir intermediate between the neutron star s rotation and the radiation field , so these assumptions combine to impose extreme constraints @xcite on pulsar parameters .",
    "this paper has explored the opposite limit , in which frb emit steadily in a narrow beam that only rarely points to the observer .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish these limits phenomenologically , but the assumption of steady collimated emission relaxes the constraints on the pulsar parameters , and is therefore attractive theoretically",
    ". the truth may lie somewhere between these extremes .",
    "if there were a complete model of coherent emission in frb it would be required to explain their high brightness . in the absence of such a model",
    "i abdicate this responsibility , and only consider the easier problem of energetic constraints .",
    "this might be excused by comparison with classic radio pulsars : the origin of their energy in spindown of rotating neutron stars is understood , but their coherent emission is not , despite a half - century of effort .",
