    "the standard model of particle physics has been tested by previous collider experiments to a very high precision  @xcite . despite its great success",
    ", many fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter can not be addressed within the standard model .",
    "two main goals of the next collider experiment , the lhc , are therefore the discovery ( or exclusion ) of a standard model higgs boson and the measurement of any new particles accessible by the collider energy  @xcite . due to the purely hadronic initial state of the collisions",
    "one expects the interactions mainly to be governed by qcd . a precise understanding of both the signal and the background will be crucial for most higgs discovery channels and for the discrimination of different scenarios beyond the standard model . for many processes a leading order ( lo ) approximation will not suffice and has to be amended by higher order corrections .",
    "the calculation of matrix elements at lo has become an automated routine for which many computer programs are available  @xcite .",
    "next to leading order ( nlo ) calculations , however , have never reached this level of automation . especially in the case of many particle final states",
    "( @xmath1 final state particle ) automatisation is not straightforward as one easily hits the limits of current computer technology .",
    "a full nlo calculation in qcd consists of a @xmath2 particle tree - level contribution ( lo ) , the real emission of an extra parton ( @xmath3 , tree - level ) and virtual corrections ( @xmath2 , one - loop diagrams ) .",
    "both real and virtual corrections can contain infrared divergences which only cancel in the sum of both contributions .",
    "these divergences can be dealt with by subtraction methods  @xcite which have also become available as automated implementations  @xcite .",
    "the only missing ingredient for a full automation of nlo calculations are the virtual corrections .",
    "although many different methods have been proposed  @xcite no fully automated implementation has been made available yet .",
    "the very limited number of results found in the literature for processes with four final state particles  @xcite underlines the importance of automatisation in the context of one - loop calculations .",
    "the ` golem ` collaboration focuses on the development of such an automatised tool for one - loop matrix element calculations .",
    "we have applied the ` golem ` method to calculate the qcd one - loop corrections of the process @xmath4 , which is a subprocess of @xmath0 .",
    "this process is a particular important background in mssm higgs searches at large values of @xmath5 , where one of the higgs bosons decays predominantly into @xmath6 pairs .",
    "our approach is based on the calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "we generate the diagrams and their corresponding algebraic expressions using ` qgraf `  @xcite and project them on a colour and helicity basis .",
    "the integration over the momentum of the virtual particle introduces tensor integrals of the form @xmath7}\\ ] ] these integrals are reduced to a basis of scalar integrals by the method described in  @xcite ; we use two independent implementations where    1 .",
    "the tensor reduction is carried out on a symbolical level and the amplitude is represented in terms of mandelstam variables , levi - civita tensors and the commonly used standard basis of scalar one - loop integrals @xmath8 the algebraic reduction and further simplifications are achieved using ` form `  @xcite and  maple .",
    "a form factor representation is introduced for the tensor integrals and the tensor reduction is delayed until the numerical evaluation .",
    "the form factors are implemented in the fortran library ` golem95 ` which is described in  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is represented in terms of mandelstam variables , spinor bi - products @xmath9 and an extended basis of one - loop integrals that allows for feynman parameters in the numerator .    in both strategies , gram determinants in the denominator are either avoided or to some extent cancelled explicitly on the symbolical level , thus resulting in a numerically stable implementation of the matrix element .",
    "the results presented below have been obtained with implementation  b ) in which the user starts from a very minimal process description .",
    "all necessary files are generated by a ` python ` script .",
    "the matrix element is obtained as a set of ` fortran90 ` files which are compiled on the target system , in our case the ecdf cluster  @xcite .",
    "the direct integration of a one - loop matrix element over phase space with an adaptive monte carlo ( mc ) has two major disadvantages .",
    "the evaluation time of an nlo matrix element is considerable larger than that of a lo matrix element .",
    "hence one should try to avoid unnecessary calls of the nlo matrix elements .",
    "the second problem are phase space regions where the chosen integral basis becomes linearly dependent and lead to numerical fluctuations .",
    "when these fluctuations reach the order of magnitude of the precision goal of the adaptive mc , the mc program tends to overestimate these phase space regions which can lead to numerical instabilities .",
    "we avoid these problems by performing the phase space integration as a reweighting of unweighted lo monte carlo events .",
    "we use ` whizard `  @xcite an adaptive monte carlo integrator to obtain a list of unweighted lo events @xmath10 such that an observable @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 where the limit is understood in the statistical sense as a limit on the variance of the mc sum .",
    "the observable at one - loop precision is obtained as @xmath13 with the local @xmath14-factor @xmath15 the matrix elements @xmath16 are understood as vectors in a given colour basis and @xmath17 is the insertion operator as defined in  @xcite , which ensures that after uv - renormalisation all poles in @xmath18 cancel .",
    "the reweighting can be understood as importance sampling with the probability density @xmath19    it should be emphasized that the definition of the local @xmath14-factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : local - k ] ) does not contain any real emission contributions and therefore the results below lack any physical interpretation .",
    "the results for the virtual correction of the process  @xmath4 have been obtained with @xmath20 massless quark flavours and for @xmath21 , a rapidity cut of @xmath22 and a separation cut of @xmath23 .",
    "the centre of mass energy is 14tev . in this data",
    "set we choose the scales as @xmath24 and fold with the cteq6.5 parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "we work with the modifications to the dipoles and insertion operators as proposed in  @xcite ; for the distributions below we have evaluated the insertion operator at @xmath25 . for this specific amplitude",
    "this modification induces a shift of the insertion operator of @xmath26.\\ ] ] on the ecdf cluster our code achieved a performance of 8.9s ( 17.6s ) per phase space point and node in double ( quadruple ) precision .",
    "the above timings suggest that an evaluation of the whole integration in quadruple precision is too costly to be practical and should be the last resort if double precision is not sufficient .",
    "the runtime will be improved further through code optimisations in the next version of the ` golem ` code .",
    "figure  [ fig : acc - hist ] shows the distribution of the values for the local @xmath14-factor , the single pole and the double pole of an amplitude for 200,000 randomly chosen points in both double and quadruple precision .",
    "the distribution of the the @xmath14-factor shows that the values are sharply peaked around the the integrated result of @xmath27 and in double precision a small fraction of less than a percent of the points stretches out to atypically large values .",
    "it is clear that in a data set of order @xmath28 mc events a single outlier of that magnitude is already enough to tamper with the result . on the other hand ,",
    "since the number of points in doubt is very small , an a posteriori test is enough and it suffices to re - evaluate those points at a higher precision . as possible test criteria we studied a cut on the @xmath14-factor , on the coefficient of the single pole and on the double pole ; if the magnitude of the double precision result exceeds the cut the point is evaluated at higher precision .",

    "figure  [ fig : s - acc ] shows the relative error @xmath30 on the cross - section versus the cut parameter  @xmath31 .",
    "the steep increase of the error indicates an outlier in the @xmath14-factor that is not reflected in the cancellation of the pole .",
    "a very similar picture emerges for a cut on the double pole ( not shown ) .",
    "this lack of correlation between the pole cancellation and error on the integral can be circumvented by imposing a test on the local @xmath14-factor as shown in figure  [ fig : k - acc ] . in the region between @xmath32 a relative error of @xmath33 is achieved while only @xmath34 of the phase space points need to be evaluated at a higher precision .",

    "a successful interpretation of the lhc data will need precise predictions of both background and signal . for many processes this involves the evaluation of one - loop qcd amplitudes with many particles in the final state .",
    "we have presented the approach of the ` golem ` collaboration to automatise such calculations that allows to generate code for the matrix element which is both fast and numerically stable in all relevant phase space regions .",
    "the need to control the accuracy of the result has been emphasised and a posteriori precision test has been proposed .",
    "we have introduced a new indirect integration method based on reweighting unweighted lo events by a local @xmath14-factor , which avoids certain problems that otherwise arise from a direct , adaptive mc integration of the one - loop matrix element .",
    "results have been presented for the virtual corrections of the process @xmath4 , which is part of an important background for mssm higgs boson searches at the lhc .",
    "we have shown that our approach allows for efficient implementations for nlo predictions of processes with multi - particle final states and that the ` golem ` project can lead to a fully automated tool for nlo calculations .",
