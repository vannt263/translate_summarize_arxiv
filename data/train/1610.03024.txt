    "argumentation ( as overviewed in e.g.  @xcite ) is a branch of knowledge representation and reasoning that , among other goals , aims to formalise reasoning with conflicting and uncertain information . in argumentation , knowledge is often ( e.g.  in @xcite ) represented via _",
    "arguments _ and conflicts are captured via _ attacks _ among arguments , and reasoning amounts to selecting sets of collectively acceptable arguments , called _ extensions _ , where acceptability conditions are dependent on the _ semantics _ chosen ( see e.g.  @xcite for overviews of argumentation semantics ) .",
    "it has been shown that argumentation is a perspicuous abstraction method capturing several existing reasoning paradigms , particularly non - monotonic reasoning and logic programming ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as forms of decision making ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , to name a few .",
    "consequently , argumentation can be seen as a significant approach to common - sense reasoning .",
    "argumentation formalisms can be classified into two families , one that builds on abstract argumentation ( aa ) @xcite , and another commonly referred to as structured argumentation ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "whereas in aa arguments are atomic , structured argumentation formalisms usually specify the internal structure of arguments and/or attacks . _ assumption - based argumentation _",
    "( aba ) @xcite is one particular structured argumentation formalism , where knowledge is represented through a deductive system comprising of a formal language and inference rules , uncertain information is represented via special sentences in the language , called _ assumptions _ , and attacks are constructively defined among sets of assumptions whenever one set of assumptions deduces ( via rules ) the _ contrary _ of some assumption in another set .    in this paper",
    "we deliver a new formalism , called aba@xmath0 , that extends aba with _ preferences _ , because accounting for preferences is an important aspect of common - sense reasoning ( see e.g.  @xcite for discussions ) .",
    "indeed , preferences are everyday phenomena helping , for example , to qualify the uncertainty of information or to discriminate among conflicting alternatives . for an illustration , consider the following example .",
    "[ example : referendum ] at a party , zed is having a discussion about the outcome of a possible referendum in the netherlands on whether to remain in the eu .",
    "two of his interlocutors , ann and bob , have diverging views on the outcome of the referendum .",
    "ann claims that the dutch would vote to leave , whereas bob maintains that they would vote to stay .",
    "if this were all the information available , zed would form two conflicting arguments , based on believing ann and bob , respectively .",
    "however , zed knows that ann likes big claims based on dubious assumptions , so he trusts bob more than ann .",
    "this preference information should lead zed to accepting bob s argument , rather than ann s .    in aba ( details in section [ sec : background ] ) , zed s knowledge ( without preferences ) can be modelled by letting @xmath1 and @xmath2 be assumptions standing for the possibility to trust ann and bob , respectively , and introducing two rules , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , representing the statements of zed s interlocutors ; given that ann and bob contradict each other , we may set @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be the contraries of assumptions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mutually attacking sets of assumptions .",
    "intuitively , the preference of @xmath2 over @xmath1 should lead one to choose @xmath8 over @xmath7 as a unique acceptable extension .",
    "this outcome is obtained in aba@xmath0  by using preference information to _ reverse attacks _ from an attacker that is less preferred than the attackee : due to the preference of @xmath2 over @xmath1 , the attack from @xmath7 to @xmath8 is reversed into an attack from @xmath8 to @xmath7 , in effect sanctioning @xmath8 as a unique acceptable extension .",
    "there are many formalisms of argumentation with preferences , e.g.  @xcite , including approaches extending aba , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this multitude reflects the lack of consensus on how preferences should be accounted for in argumentation in particular , and common - sense reasoning in general ( also see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a way to discriminate and evaluate distinct formalisms is to investigate their formal properties . in this paper",
    "we show that aba@xmath0  satisfies various desirable properties of argumentation with preferences .",
    "we also show that attack reversal differentiates aba@xmath0  from the majority of approaches to argumentation with preferences which discard attacks due to preference information ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of reversing attacks is shared with _ preference - based argumentation frameworks _ ( pafs ) @xcite  an aa - based formalism accommodating preferences .",
    "pafs , as well as some structured argumentation formalisms ( e.g.  @xcite ) , assume preferences as given on the meta level , particularly over arguments .",
    "instead , aba@xmath0  assumes preferences as given on the object level , particularly over assumptions , similarly to the well known structured argumentation formalism aspic@xmath0  @xcite ( which , however , accommodates preferences over rules too ) .",
    "most existing approaches assume ( e.g.  @xcite ) or perform ( e.g.  @xcite ) an aggregation of object - level preferences to give meta - level preferences over arguments ( e.g.  @xcite or extensions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , aba@xmath0  incorporates preferences given over assumptions directly into the definition of attack .    with respect to aba , existing approaches ( notably @xcite )",
    "have so far accommodated preferences within the class of so - called _ flat _ aba frameworks @xcite , where assumptions can not themselves be deduced from other assumptions .",
    "non - flat aba frameworks are however useful for knowledge representation , as exemplified next .",
    "[ example : referendum non - flat ] suppose that dan joins the conversation of zed , ann and bob , and says that one should always trust bob .",
    "a natural way to model this in aba is to add an assumption @xmath9 , standing for trust in dan , as well as a rule @xmath10 , representing dan s statement about bob .",
    "such a representation would result into a non - flat aba framework , because the assumption @xmath2 is deducible from another assumption , namely @xmath9 .",
    "aba@xmath0  handles preferences in both flat and non - flat frameworks , thus forgoing possible limitations to expressiveness .",
    "we show that , in general , aba@xmath0  conservatively extends aba and satisfies various desirable properties regarding relationship among semantics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , rationality postulates ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and preference handling ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also show that flat aba@xmath0  frameworks satisfy additional desirable properties , subject to the principle of _ weak contraposition _ that we propose in this paper , and which is a relaxed version of the principle of _ contraposition _ utilised notably in aspic@xmath0  to obtain desirable outcomes .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we provide background on aba in section [ sec : background ] and present aba@xmath0  in section [ sec : aba+ ] . in section [ sec : properties of aba+ ] we study properties of semantics , preference handling and rationality in aba@xmath0 .",
    "we introduce weak contraposition in section [ sec : wcp ] and investigate its effects on _ flat _",
    "frameworks in section [ sec : properties of flat aba+ ] .",
    "we devote section [ sec : comparison ] for comparing aba@xmath0  to several formalisms of argumentation with preferences .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : concluding remarks ] .",
    "the precursor to this research is the recently published short paper @xcite , where we presented the main idea and basics of aba@xmath0 . with respect to that work , in section [ sec : aba+ ]",
    "we extend aba@xmath0  to non - flat frameworks and define new semantics ( ideal ) .",
    "sections [ subsec : relationship among semantics ] and [ subsec : preference handling principles ] are new , whereas section [ subsec : rationality postulates ] significantly expands its precursor subsection ` rationality postulates ' in @xcite with new results ( starting from principle [ principle : classical consistency ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper , i.e.  sections [ sec : wcp ] , [ sec : properties of flat aba+ ] and [ sec : comparison ] , consists of new material .",
    "we base the following aba background on @xcite .    [",
