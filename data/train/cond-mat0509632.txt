    "high - temperature superconductivity occurs in a moderately hole doped mott insulator.@xcite the symmetry of the cooper pairs has been established to be @xmath0-wave.@xcite to explain the mechanism of @xmath0-wave superconductivity , several mechanisms have been proposed . among others ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation theory suggest a @xmath0-wave pairing mechanism@xcite between d - orbital electrons at copper sites .",
    "another @xmath0-wave pairing mechanism is proposed in the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory.@xcite in the rvb theory , electrons are assumed to be spin - charge separated . in the slave - boson approach , @xcite spinons , which carry the spin degrees of freedom , form a @xmath0-wave pairing state .",
    "this pairing state is associated with the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations.@xcite combined with bose - einstein condensation of holons , which carry the electric charge , the pairing state of the spinons leads to a @xmath0-wave superconducting state .",
    "both of these theories are based on a pairing state between copper site electrons which produce antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "however , from the sign of the hall coefficient@xcite the charge carriers seem to be doped holes .",
    "optical conductivity measurements also support that the charge carriers are doped holes because the drude weight in the optical conductivity@xcite is proportional to the doped hole concentration .",
    "if we assume that the charge carriers are doped holes , then it is natural to expect that high - temperature superconductivity is based on a @xmath0-wave pairing mechanism between doped holes . in this paper",
    ", we propose such a mechanism based on a picture for the doped holes .",
    "the picture is that each hole induces a spin texture that is characterized by a non - vanishing topological charge density in the spin system through the suppression of the antiferromagnetic correlations .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", a half - skyrmion spin texture @xcite formation is discussed in the single - hole - doped cuprate within the non - linear sigma model(nlsm ) description@xcite of the heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the formation of the half - skyrmion spin texture can be understood by using an analogy to a superfluid system : let us consider a two - dimensional boson system which exhibits superfluidity in the ground state .",
    "the bose - einstein condensate is described by a gross - pitaevskii equation.@xcite if we suppress the condensate at some point @xmath3 , then we see that a vortex is formed around @xmath3 from the analysis of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "note that the field described by the gross - pitaevskii equation is a classical field .",
    "however , the non - condensed component near the vortex core is described by quantum bosons . in case of a charged boson system ,",
    "the condensate is locally suppressed by a magnetic flux , or a vortex .",
    "we can apply this result to the two - dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet . in the schwinger boson mean field",
    "theory,@xcite the n ' eel ordering is described by bose - einstein condensation of the schwinger bosons.@xcite if we assume that the doped hole forms a spin singlet with a localized spin at a copper site , then the condensate is suppressed at that site .",
    "forming a zhang - rice singlet in the antiferromagnet plays a similar role of introducing a magnetic flux in a charged boson condensate . as in the case of a superfluid system",
    ", a vortex appears around the site . in terms of the spins ,",
    "the vortex is a spin texture with the non - vanishing topological charge density @xcite that is given by @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the unit vector @xmath5 describes the staggered component of the spins .",
    "note that the spin at the core of the spin texture is a quantum spin analogous to the normal component near a vortex core in a superfluid , and so the spin can form a singlet state with the doped hole spin , which is the zhang - rice singlet.@xcite based on the schwinger boson mean field theory , we find that the topological charge , which is obtained by integrating @xmath6 over a whole region , is quantized to @xmath7.@xcite because of this quantized value , the spin texture is called half - skyrmion .    as argued in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the dispersion of the half - skyrmion is in good agreement with the results of the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in the undoped compounds.@xcite the dispersion of the half - skyrmion excitation is the same as that of the quasiparticles in the @xmath8-flux phase with a dynamically induced mass.@xcite in fact , the effective theory of the half - skyrmion is similar to that of the @xmath8-flux phase : the half - skyrmions are described by dirac fermions with a u(1 ) gauge field interaction .",
    "anomalously broad peaks observed in arpes are associated with the self - trapping of the half - skyrmions due to the coupling to the longitudinal gauge field.@xcite    in ref.@xcite , we assume that there is n ' eel ordering .",
    "the presense of the n ' eel ordering is used for obtaining the quantized topological charge . in the absence of the n ' eel ordering , the topological charge is no more quantized because the antiferromagnetic correlations decay exponentially with a length scale given by the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath9",
    ". however , the system preserves the local relationship between the hole density and the topological charge density .",
    "we consider spin textures with such topological charge density and hereafter we call such a spin texture staggered - spin - vortex .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec_model ] , we describe the model for the staggered - spin - vortex formation . the pairing interaction is discussed in sec.[sec_pairing ] .",
    "we solve the gap equation in sec.[sec_gap ] and show that the stable pairing state has @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "section [ sec_conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we assume that the holes and the localized spins are independent degrees of freedom .",
    "such a model is , for instance , the spin - fermion model , which is derived from the d - p model by applying a canonical transformation .",
    "in such a model , the spin system is described by the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , @xmath10 here the summation is taken over the nearest neighbor sites and @xmath11 denote the spin moment at copper sites . as an effective theory of the spin system",
    ", we consider the cp@xmath12 model,@xcite which is derived from the nlsm by representing @xmath13 in terms of the schwinger bosons : @xmath14 : @xmath15 , \\label{eq_cp1}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the antiferromagnetic spin wave excitation gap and @xmath17 is the spin wave velocity .",
    "the coupling @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 the spin stiffness constant .",
    "@xmath21 is the renormalization factor due to quantum phase fluctuations . in the spin disordered phase , @xmath22 , and there is no antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations are characterized by the correlation length @xmath23 . for the schwinger bosons ,",
    "the presence of the antiferromagnetic correlations is associated with the phase coherence among the schwinger bosons .    for the kinetic energy of the holes , we assume @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 the effective mass .",
    "this is an approximate form in the continuum .    the coupling between the holes and the localized spins @xmath27 has the form of the antiferromagnetic kondo coupling : @xmath28 the parameter @xmath29 is on the order of @xmath30ev .",
    "because of this strong kondo coupling , holes suppress phase coherence of the schwinger bosons locally through the zhang - rice singlet formation .",
    "the suppression of the phase coherence leads to a staggered - spin - vortex : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the creation operator of the staggered - spin - vortex ( anti - staggered - spin - vortex ) .",
    "the coefficient is determined by considering the limit of @xmath34 . in this limit , the spin texture is the half - skyrmion . the gauge flux @xmath35 is associated with the spin chirality.@xcite note that @xmath36 , because in the equilibrium there is an equal number of staggered spin vortices and anti - staggered spin vortices , and so @xmath37 .    by integrating out the schwinger bosons ,",
    "we obtain the effective action of the gauge field @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath22 , the action takes the maxwellian form .",
    "that is , the gauge field is massless .",
    "however , in the spin disordered phase , the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath9 is finite",
    ". therefore , the gauge field propagator decays with a length scale of @xmath9 . to include this feature , we perform a duality mapping",
    "we write @xmath39 as @xmath40 here the phase @xmath41 is associated with the coherent motion of the schwinger bosons and the phase @xmath42 is associated with the staggered - spin - vortices .",
    "note that this form is applicable for the description outside the vortex cores . after performing a stratonovich - hubbard transformation in eq.([eq_cp1 ] ) , we obtain the following lagrangian density , @xmath43 we find @xmath44 by integrating out @xmath41 .",
    "this constraint is satisfied by introducing a gauge field : @xmath45 we define the vortex current by @xmath46 in terms of the staggered - spin - vortex and anti - staggered - spin - vortex fields , the vortex density is given by @xmath47 from the equation of the continuity , @xmath48 , we find @xmath49,\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that the kinetic energy of the holes is described by eq.([eq_ke ] ) .",
    "the coupling between the gauge field @xmath50 and the vortex current @xmath51 is of the minimal coupling : @xmath52    since @xmath53 and @xmath54 describes phase fluctuations of the schwinger boson density , nonvanishing gauge flux @xmath55 describes the suppression of the phase coherence .",
    "contrary to the gauge flux @xmath35 , the flux quantum for the meissner phase of @xmath56 is @xmath57 because staggered - spin - vortex carry a unit gauge charge .",
    "therefore , the relation between the vortex density and the gauge flux is @xmath58 the gauge field @xmath50 is equivalent to the gauge field in the slave - boson mean field theory",
    "the pairing interaction is obtained from eqs.([eq_flux ] ) and ( [ eq_coupling ] ) by eliminating the gauge field @xmath50 .",
    "we take the coulomb gauge : @xmath59 in the momentum space , @xmath60 from eq.([eq_flux ] ) we obtain @xmath61 the staggered - spin - vortex current operator is @xmath62 substituting these equations into eq.([eq_coupling ] ) , we obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the area of the system . since we are interested in the cooper pairing , we set @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath66 by making replacement of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 therefore , we may write @xmath72 from this form , it is apparent that the interaction exists for either staggered - spin - vortex pairs or anti - staggered - spin - vortex pairs .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath73 @xmath74    a similar pairing interaction was discussed in the composite fermion system at half - filled landau levels.@xcite . in that system ,",
    "the composite fermions are spinless fermion and there is no other index associated with internal symmetry .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the pairing interaction leads to @xmath75-wave pairing state .",
    "the sign is determined by the direction of the applied magnetic field perpendicular to the system .",
    "this pairing state is consistent with numerical simulations.@xcite    before going into the analysis of the gap equation derived from the hamiltonian ( [ eq_h ] ) and ( [ eq_hs ] ) , we show an intuitive view about the origin of the attractive interaction . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_flux ] ) , the gauge flux @xmath76 is produced by the doped holes .",
    "suppose a hole passes with the fermi velocity the region of the gauge flux created by another hole .",
    "then , as schematically shown in fig .  [ fig_p ] the motion of the former hole is equivalent to a charged particle motion under a magnetic field .",
    "magnetic lorentz force like interaction is induced between the two holes .",
    "such an interaction leads to a chiral pairing state . in this pairing mechanism ,",
    "the gap is scaled by the fermi energy .",
    "since holes carry either positive or negative gauge charge , we expect there are two chiral pairing states with opposite chiralities .",
    "the stable pairing state in the bulk turns out to be @xmath0-wave pairing state as we shall show in the next section",
    ".     created by the hole sitting at the center .",
    "if another hole passes this region with the fermi velocity as shown in the figure , a magnetic lorentz force like interaction is induced between the two holes . ]",
    "now we apply the bcs mean field theory to eq.([eq_h ] ) .",
    "first we consider staggered - spin - vortex pairs described by @xmath77 . in the following , we set @xmath78 and @xmath79 , to simplify notations .",
    "we consider the grand canonical ensemble and define the following mean field : @xmath80 where @xmath81 the mean field hamiltonian is @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 with @xmath84 the chemical potential and the summation in the momentum space is taken over half of the brillouin zone .",
    "the gap equation is given by @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "a similar gap equation is analyzed in ref.@xcite in the context of the composite fermion pairing .",
    "we apply the analysis presented in ref.@xcite . in order to solve the gap equation , we introduce the following ansatz@xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an integer . in eq .",
    "( [ eq_gap ] ) the integral with respect to @xmath89 is reduced to @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the function @xmath92 is exactly calculated by setting @xmath93 and applying a contour integral in the complex plane . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_gap ] ) , we see that if the interaction is attractive ( repulsive ) then the sign of @xmath94 is positive ( negative ) . for @xmath95 case , @xmath96 while @xmath97 case , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . therefore , the gap equation has solutions only for @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath101.\\ ] ] from the asymptotic forms in @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we take the following approximate form:@xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fermi energy of the holes",
    ". the gap @xmath106 is obtained from the following equation : @xmath107 the largest gap @xmath108 is obtained for the case of @xmath109-wave ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the second largest gap @xmath111 is obtained for the case of @xmath112-wave ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the third largest gap is @xmath114 for @xmath115 .    for anti - staggered - spin - vortex pairs",
    ", we may carry out the same analysis .",
    "since the interaction term has opposite sign compared to the staggered - spin - vortex pair case , the gap function @xmath116 has the following form : @xmath117 with @xmath100 .    from the above analyses , the linear combination of the gap functions is @xmath118 the relative phase between @xmath119 and @xmath116 is set to be zero .",
    "( a non - zero phase can appear if there is a magnetic field . ) for the case of @xmath110 , the symmetry of the cooper pair is @xmath120 . such a state can be stablized only at the boundary of the sample in the square lattice .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath113 case , that is , @xmath0-wave pairing state is stable in the bulk .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the above pairing interaction leads to @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "the above analysis is carried out for the staggered - spin - vortices . in terms of those fields ,",
    "the hole spin states are implicit . for spin",
    "singlet pairing states , the spin states should be @xmath121 and @xmath122 where @xmath123 in @xmath124 denotes the hole spin state .",
    "the relative phase , which is arbitrary in the above analysis , is @xmath8 for the spin - singlet pairing state : @xmath125    now we consider the effect of the staggered - spin vortex - vortex interaction and the coulomb interaction .",
    "those repulsive interactions reduce the gap value . in the following we consider those effects separately . in order to evaluate the vortex - vortex interaction effect",
    ", we consider a two - vortex solution as follows : @xmath126 the interaction energy between the vortices is @xmath127 taking into account the fact that the range of the interaction is limited by the antiferromagnetic correlation length @xmath9 , we obtain @xmath128 in the momentum space , @xmath129 with the constraint , @xmath130 .    in the presence of the vortex - vortex interaction @xmath131 ,",

    "versus @xmath142 . ]",
    "the effect of the vortex - vortex interaction is large for strong antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the gap values are somewhat reduced by the vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "while the relevant parameter region would be @xmath143 , around @xmath144 , the f - wave gap becomes larger than the d - wave gap .",
    "note that as an approximation , @xmath134 is fixed in the above calculation for simplicity .",
    "for more precise calculations , we require detail analysis of @xmath145 dependence of @xmath146 and @xmath21 .",
    "another pairing mechanism based on merons , which presumably correspond to the spin texture with non - zero topological density , was discussed by berciu and john.@xcite from the analysis of an extended hubbard model , where a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion is included , it was suggested that meron - antimeron pairs lead to d - wave superconductivity . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the pairing interaction between merons and antimerons comes from the vortex - antivortex interaction , and the pairing interaction ( [ eq_pairing ] ) is not considered .",
    "although the vortex - antivortex interaction is attractive interaction , the analysis of the gap equation for the vortex - antivortex interaction within our ansatz shows that there is no pairing state for @xmath147 . in this analysis ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath134 is fixed .",
    "more precise analysis requires @xmath9 dependence of @xmath134 .",
    "however , @xmath134 is expected to be an increasing function with respect to @xmath9 , and the increase of @xmath134 leads to reduction of the gap values for large @xmath9 .",
    "now we consider the effect of the coulomb interaction .",

    "in this paper , we have proposed a mechanism of @xmath0-wave superconductivity based on a spin texture with non - zero topological charge density .",
    "the spin texture formation is based on the zhang - rice singlet formation in the background of the antiferromagnetic correlations . in terms of a gauge field that describes antiferromagnetic spin correlations ,",
    "the spin texture is described by a gauge flux .",
    "the interaction between the flux and the hole current induces the magnetic lorentz force like interaction between the holes .",
    "such an interaction leads to chiral pairing states with opposite chiralities .",
    "it turns out that the stable pairing state in the bulk is the @xmath0-wave pairing state .",
    "the stability of the pairing state is examined against the vortex - vortex interaction and the coulomb interaction .    in our pairing mechanism ,",
    "the @xmath109-wave state is unstable in the bulk .",
    "however , this state can be stabilized in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "since the @xmath109-wave gap is much larger than the d - wave gap , we expect enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature if we can induce that component . if there is the @xmath109-wave component , then the parity is broken locally . while the time - reversal symmetry is not broken unless one chiral pairing state is suppressed .",
