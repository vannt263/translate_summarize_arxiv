    "we appear to live in an expanding universe , and the expansion is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this acceleration can not be caused by the baryonic matter that we interact with everyday , because it exerts a braking effect on the universe s expansion ; instead , the acceleration must be caused by something ( frequently termed dark energy ) that exerts a negative pressure on the universe .",
    "our current understanding of dark energy is very poor ; from observations we know that it today makes up around 70% of our universe s energy density @xcite and has an equation of state with @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density , @xmath4 .",
    "any equation of state with @xmath5 will exert sufficient negative pressure to cause accelerated expansion , so why do we currently observe @xmath3 ?",
    "little is known about dark energy so there are many possible explanations that we can not currently exclude .",
    "the standard model of a cosmological constant ( with @xmath6 ) is consistent with the current best constraints @xcite , but the current uncertainties leave much room for manoeuvre , including models where the equation of state varies with time @xcite . tighter constraints will allow us to better pin down the nature of dark energy and the role it plays in the expansion of our universe .",
    "first discovered in q0957 + 561 by @xcite , strong gravitational lensing is now a powerful cosmological tool ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this work we examine how well @xmath2 can be constrained using a population of gravitational lens systems with two background sources at different redshifts ( schematic shown in figure  [ bench ] ) .",
    "such systems are known with cluster scale lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a galaxy  scale double source plane system was recently found @xcite , although cosmography is currently imprecise using the galaxy  scale system , as no spectroscopic redshift for the far source has been obtained ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "the incentive to use such systems is strong ; current methods of constraining @xmath2 are degenerate with the hubble constant @xcite , but taking the ratio of the two einstein radii in a double source system allows us to constrain @xmath2 independently of the hubble constant .",
    "this independent constraint will not only teach us about the nature of dark energy , but will also help improve constraints on other cosmological parameters by providing complimentary probes with a prior on @xmath2 .",
    "for example the wmap7 constraints on @xmath7 ( the reduced hubble constant ) are @xmath8 @xcite for a flat @xmath9cdm model with @xmath2 fixed at @xmath10 , whilst allowing @xmath2 to be a free parameter loosens the wmap - only constraints by nearly an order of magnitude to @xmath11 .",

    "mass causes the deflection of light and so can act as a gravitational lens , producing a set of images where the time delay function is stationary . for a strong lens system with a source lying directly on the optical axis this produces an einstein ring .",

    "the einstein radius is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the einstein radius , @xmath20 is the projected mass within the einstein radius , and the @xmath21 are the angular diameter distances between observer ( o ) , lens ( l ) and source ( s ) . in this work",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the einstein radius of an sis is given by @xmath23 for an sis model , strong lensing occurs when the source is in the region @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the _ unlensed _ angular position of the source with respect to the optical axis .",
    "two images are produced at @xmath26 with magnification @xmath27 .    since the equation of state governs the expansion of our universe it affects the evolution of angular diameter distances as a function of redshift .",

    "we choose a hypothetical double source plane lens , with [ @xmath41 as the  fiducial system \" .",
    "we use a uniform prior of @xmath42 and @xmath43 and assume the observational precision on @xmath36 to be 1% ( i.e. @xmath44 ) to perform a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis of the @xmath2@xmath16 plane .    for our mcmc analysis",

    "given the assumed 1% measurement , we find that it would be possible to constrain @xmath48 at the 95% cl , for the fiducial system .",
    "however the posterior gives little constraint on @xmath49 without a tighter prior on @xmath16 ; this occurs because in a high @xmath16 universe , dark energy plays very little role in the expansion history and so @xmath36 becomes broadly insensitive to the equation of state .",
    "a significant body of evidence now exists to suggest @xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this allows us to exclude the right of figure  [ sim ] and places our universe in the regime where @xmath36 _ is _ sensitive to the dark energy equation of state .",

    "the dotted vertical lines represent the 1@xmath47 constraint on @xmath2 from wmap alone .",
    "uncertainties significantly below 1% are currently unrealistic given the need to correctly model the compound lensing introduced by the first source .",
    "the inferred uncertainty on @xmath36 in @xcite is 1.2% , without accounting for lensing by the intermediate source but only using a conjugate points analysis rather than all available pixels from the hst images . ]    in order to take advantage of this prior knowledge we use the wmap 7 year results from @xcite and resample their mcmc chains using the importance sampling method as outlined in @xcite .",
    "we use the mcmc chains produced assuming a flat @xmath2cdm model , giving a set of points each possessing a value for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and a weight .",
    "each point in the wmap chain is then given a likelihood @xmath52 , according to equation  [ li ] and the chain is re - weighted such that the posterior is the product of the original weight and the likelihood . in figure  [ unc ]",
    "we plot the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath47 confidence intervals for the fiducial system plus wmap as a function of percentage uncertainty on @xmath36 ; an uncertainty of less than 2% is key to improving the constraint on @xmath2 with a single system . whilst minimising the uncertainty on @xmath36 maximises the constraint on @xmath2 ,",
    "a measurement much more accurate than 1% is unlikely with current resources , given the need for space telescope time in order to constrain well the lens mass model and the image separation .",
    "the inferred uncertainty on @xmath36 in @xcite is 1.2% , neglecting any uncertainties induced by lensing from the first source .",
    "these systems are compound lenses ; @xcite use the tully - fisher relation to estimate the mass of the first source and conservatively estimate that the uncertainty on @xmath36 grows to approximately 6 per cent .",
    "their estimate does not attempt to model the relensing and hence neglects most of the information available in the high - resolution imaging , and modeling the lensing by the first source of a typical compound lens is likely to significantly improve upon the 6% estimate of @xcite .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that using a pixelated image modelling technique can quantify perturbations due to substructure with masses as low as 0.1% of the the primary lens mass ( enclosed within the einstein radius ) , although this method has not yet been applied to significant perturbers outside the primary lens plane . in this work we take @xmath53 unless otherwise stated ; this may prove optimistic , but serves to illustrate the cosmological information encoded in such systems . we do not wish to imply that 1% is definitely achievable and we will explore the precision with which @xmath36 can be measured in future work ( collett et al . in prep ) .",
    "a measurement of the fiducial system at @xmath53 gives the constraint of @xmath54 when combined with the wmap7 dataset .",
    "the main improvement upon the wmap data comes from the fact that low @xmath2 , low @xmath1 universes ( bottom left of figure  [ sim ] ) are strongly excluded by the double source plane system given our fiducial cosmology . in order to further build intuition and to suggest an observing strategy",
    ", we investigate the optimal [ @xmath55 configuration for a single system .",
    "figures  [ move ] and  [ intuition ] show the effect of altering the redshifts of each object in the system .",
    "we find that increasing the redshift of the second source improves the constraint on @xmath2 ; this makes physical sense since it means @xmath56 and @xmath57 probe a longer part of the cosmic expansion history , amplifying any deviations from @xmath58 .",
    "we also find that the constraint on @xmath2 is improved by decreasing the separation of lens and first source .",
    "small @xmath59 and large @xmath60 being the optimal configuration is physically sensible  it makes @xmath61 most sensitive to @xmath2 , since very little of the @xmath62 integral is spent in the redshift range also included in @xmath63 .",
    "it is also important that @xmath64 or the ratio of @xmath65 quickly saturates to @xmath66 independent of the underlying cosmography , ensuring @xmath67 ; this is also the case when @xmath60 is small .",
    "small @xmath68 also increases the importance of lensing by the intermediate object and could introduce a significant systematic error if the lensing by the first source is modeled incorrectly .",
    "we leave the analysis of secondary lensing for a later work , but note that it should be possible to model for bright systems due to the wealth of positional information contained in two bright arcs . for low mass first sources",
    "secondary lensing is likely to be dominated by external convergence between the sources , which can be statistically modelled @xcite .",
    "secondary lensing is likely to cause problems in systems where the intermediate source is of intermediate mass and the background source is faint . a second factor that may trouble systems with small @xmath68",
    "is that the mass density profile within the inner einstein ring may be significantly different to that contained by the outer ring and this will mean the uncertainty on @xmath36 could be significantly affected by the uncertainty on the mass distribution of the lens . hence ,",
    "for very small @xmath69 it may be impossible to achieve a 1% uncertainty on @xmath36 , although the cross section for very small @xmath59 is also very small .",
    "angular diameter distance is an integral of @xmath2 and @xmath70 over redshift , so the exact nature of the degeneracy between the two parameters varies with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the curve of the  banana \" shaped distribution in figure  [ sim ] depends on the redshifts , as does the constraining power of each system ; hence we do not necessarily expect @xmath73 systems to provide a @xmath74 improvement . indeed , the precision could scale better or worse than @xmath74 depending on the widths and orientations of the constraints from each system ; the constraining power of @xmath73 systems is not trivial to predict .",
    "we now draw a set of double source systems from a realistic population of lenses and sources .",
    "we assume that double lenses are more likely to be found by observing already - known single lens systems to greater depth and at different wavelengths .",
    "we focus on two types of initial surveys : photometrically selected wide arc catalogues where the survey looks for multiple sources around a central object ( e.g. , cassowary ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectroscopically selected catalogues where the survey looks at the spectra of galaxies for higher redshift emission lines , such as slacs @xcite .",
    "follow up of an existing catalogue introduces two selection functions , the selection function of the original survey and of the follow up .",
    "we estimate the selection function for current surveys in two ways : we create a mock photometric catalogue for cassowary - like surveys and we draw random systems from the current slacs sample of @xcite . for the follow up selection function",
    "we assume the observing strategy will prioritise those systems which are best for cosmography . in practice",
    "this usually means looking for high - redshift background second sources given a low redshift ( @xmath75 ) lens  source pair , or low redshift intermediate sources , given a well separated lens and source . as such we assume follow up",
    "will either be conducted in the millimetre , in order to preferentially select higher redshift second sources , or in deep optical imaging , where low - redshift intermediate sources could be found . for the millimetre population",
    "we adopt the unlensed model of @xcite , assuming observations at 1.1  mm and continuum flux limits of 0.3  mjy and 1  mjy ; an example source redshift probability distribution function for a lens at @xmath76 is shown in figure  [ bethpop ] .    , with velocity dispersion 350  km  s@xmath77 . given observations at 1.1  mm down to a flux limit 0.3  mjy .",
    "the pdf does not integrate to one , since it is not certain that a second source is found .",
    "the dashed line shows the unlensed number density of sources with @xmath78  mjy per square degree ( scale on right hand @xmath79-axis ) in the @xcite model .",
    "some of the @xmath80  mjy objects also contribute to the lensed pdf due to magnification . ]    for the optical source distribution we use the photometric redshift catalogue of galaxies observed in the cosmos @xcite field ; this catalogue goes to an @xmath81-band depth of 25 mag , but we limit our detection depth to an @xmath81 magnitude of 22 to allow for magnifications of @xmath82 by strong lensing .",
    "both the optical and millimetre depths are conservative in light of upcoming telescopes .",
    "however , these represent the limit to which we trust the models ; beyond these depths a currently unknown population of dim objects may exist , although if the shape of the redshift distributions do not vary significantly with flux limit then the cosmological conclusions are independent of survey depth . given a population of known lenses we evaluate the probability of being a double source plane lens , @xmath83 : for a @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] pair we calculate the lensing cross section and magnification tensor as functions of redshift , and apply these to the @xcite model or cosmos catalogue .",
    "this method is broadly similar to the method in @xcite . for axi - symmetric lenses",
    "our method is equivalent to solving for each lens the integral @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the differential number distribution of second sources per unit solid angle with respect to redshift and flux , @xmath88 is the lensing angular cross section , and @xmath89 is a function of the flux ( @xmath90 ) and the survey flux limit ( @xmath91 ) ; @xmath89 encodes the magnification bias . in the case of an sis ,",

    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for finding a source at redshift @xmath94 is the derivative of equation [ integral ] with respect to @xmath95 .",

    "we find that a blind search of galaxy scale lenses is unlikely to yield double source plane systems unless deeper sensitivities are probed .",
    "however , by looking at surveys that preferentially select more massive systems ( groups , or the rare very massive elliticals ) we can increase that rate . as an example , the cosmic horseshoe @xcite has a @xmath10430% chance of a s@xmath1030.3  mjy ( at 1.1  mm ) object lying behind it , whilst a [ @xmath105 , @xmath106kms@xmath77 ] elliptical will lens a s@xmath1030.3  mjy source @xmath1046% of the time .",

    "a shallow survey of lots of lenses would select fewer of these low redshift millimetre sources ( and thus be optimal for cosmography ) , but since there are very few known ( simple ) high mass lenses , such a survey is currently impossible . despite the fact that slacs provides much better cosmography per double source plane system than the cassowary - type , our results are dominated by the few slacs objects with very high velocity dispersion and close first source : the lower velocity dispersion objects are unlikely to be double source plane systems and there are no high velocity dispersion systems with intermediate or large lens  source separation .",
    "indeed , many high mass lenses will be missed by slacs due to the source arcs falling outside the spectroscopic fibre .",

    "we show the planck and 6 double source plane system constraints for each parameter pair in the flat @xmath184 model , marginalized over the third parameter .",
    "it is clear from figures [ waconf ] and [ planckwa ] that @xmath183 and @xmath184 are degenerate ; as such we use the figure of merit ( fom ) as defined in equation  6 of @xcite to quantify the constraining power : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the area enclosed by the 95% confidence interval in the @xmath183@xmath184 plane marginalised over all other parameters . using this definition",

    "figure  [ fomintuition ] shows the fom contour plot for planck plus one double source plane system with @xmath111 ; we find that for @xmath198 models the figure of merit increases as @xmath94 increases and as @xmath59 decreases .",
    "we also find that the @xmath199 degeneracy increases ( away from vertical in figure  [ planckwa ] ) with increasing lens redshift , conversely below @xmath200 the degeneracy is almost broken , but the fom rapidly degrades as @xmath126 decreases .",
    "since the degeneracy between parameters changes with the redshift of lens and sources , the fom is likely to grow quickly with sample size . to strongly constrain evolving models",
    "it will be important to have a good coverage of lens redshifts .",
    "the ongoing bells survey @xcite uses very similar selection methods to slacs , but targets higher redshift potential lenses ; their 25 definite and 11 probable galaxy - galaxy systems have lens redshifts 0.4 @xmath201 z @xmath201 0.7 .",
    "these higher redshift systems should be especially useful for incressing the double source plane fom  if a second source can be found behind any of them .    throughout this work",
    "we have asserted a spatially flat universe , but allowing @xmath202 to be free weakens the constraints on @xmath2 . without asserting spatial flatness we find that wmap plus the 6 typical systems give the following results for a constant equation of state : @xmath203 . for non - flat evolving equation of state models",
    "our fom for planck plus 6 lenses degrades slightly to 12.3 .",
    "double source plane systems place no significant additional constraints on @xmath202 once the planck results are included due to the excellent precision with which cmb lensing constrains flatness .",
    "strongly lensed double source systems and the cmb are not the only datasets to constrain @xmath2 ; supernovae ( sne ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , galaxy clusters , and time delays in strongly lensed time variable sources ( @xmath204 ) also provide constraints on @xmath2 . whilst only the strongly lensed double source method is independent of the hubble constant , wmap+bao+@xmath204 can still give strong constraints on @xmath2 when combined with a prior on @xmath7 obtained using local supernovae ( we have not included high redshift supernovae or galaxy cluster constraints ) .",
    "@xcite used this combination of methods , finding @xmath205 . in the future the constraints from strongly lensed double source plane systems can easily be combined with other datasets to give an improved constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "the main advantages of this are the breaking of degeneracies and , perhaps more importantly , the investigation of systematics inherently afforded by using different measurements . figure  [ multiple ] , shows the @xmath2@xmath1 plane for a typical set of 6 slacs type double sources ( listed in table [ systems ] ) given a uniform flat prior on @xmath2 and @xmath1 and a forecast combination of wmap+bao+@xmath204 + 6 double source plane lenses . in this case",
    "we recover a constraint of @xmath206 , for our fiducial cosmology of @xmath6 . setting the fiducial cosmology to @xmath207 yields @xmath208 .",
    "these represent a 30% improvement on the @xcite result , although the @xmath204 and bao constraints will improve significantly as their datasets grows and if @xmath7 is better constrained ; this method might be slightly less competitive by the time 6 double source plane systems have been found , but a significant strength of multiple source plane lenses is as a constraint on @xmath2 independent of any measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "most @xmath198 forecasts have used a fisher formalism to estimate future parameter constraints ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whilst the fisher forecasts are not directly comparable to our mcmc forecasts it seems that the @xmath198 degeneracy for double source plane lenses will be in a similar direction to bao , sne and weak lensing .",
    "for all these probes low @xmath183 correlates with positive @xmath184 .",
    "however , for very low lens redshifts ( @xmath200 ) , the double source plane constraints on @xmath183 become almost independent of @xmath184 , so there is scope for complementarity , but at the expense of the constraining power of each lens .",
    "the problem of finding second sources will not be trivial , and the probability of finding a second source scales with mass squared .",
    "as such a dedicated search strategy should look to find second sources behind high mass lenses .",
    "currently there are a handful of good candidate systems , and a few double source systems should be uncovered with a moderate investment of telescope time . with a larger population of known lenses , the number of very good candidates for such a search will increase , making searches for compound lenses more efficient and more useful ; not all double source systems will be particularly useful for cosmography , mostly due to having both sources far beyond the lens , but a selective search strategy can minimise the time spent on these objects .",
    "one wants to draw the second source from a different population to the first to make @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath94 less likely ; this can either be achieved by looking in a different wavelength or to significantly greater depth .",
    "it may also not be possible to measure @xmath36 to 1% for all objects , especially after accounting for lensing by the second source .",
    "however , the cassowary results for 20 lenses with a 4% uncertainty on @xmath36 show that given a large sample , @xmath2 can still be constrained with double source plane lens systems",
    ". further work will evaluate the systematics of measuring @xmath36 , paying particular attention to the mass model of the lens and lensing by the intermediate source or other perturbers along the line of sight .    1 .",
