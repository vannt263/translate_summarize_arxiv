    "nonperturbative renormalization mom schemes have been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite by imposing a set of renormalization conditions , which specify the renormalization of the fermion wave function , of the fermion mass , and of composite operators like fermion bilinears .",
    "the renormalization conditions are imposed in the chiral limit of qcd , and therefore , by construction , these schemes are mass - independent , meaning that all the renormalization constants are independent of the value of the fermion mass .",
    "this is useful for instance when considering ratios of quantities such as masses ; in a mass - independent scheme @xmath0 for two different fermions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , does not renormalize since the renormalization constants cancel between the numerator and the denominator .",
    "the renormalization conditions are chosen so that renormalized correlators involving the vector and axial currents satisfy the ward identities ( wis ) dictated by the symmetries of the theory .",
    "using massless schemes for massive quarks involves violations of the ward identities by terms that scale like powers of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the typical energy scale of the correlators that are computed .",
    "recent lattice studies have begun investigating the nonperturbative dynamics of heavy quarks like charm and bottom , including these heavy flavors as relativistic dynamical degrees of freedom in the path integral . in current simulations",
    "the mass of the heavy quarks is often of the same order of magnitude as the uv cutoff , defined as the inverse lattice spacing @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to reach a regime where there is a clear separation between the fermion mass , the renormalization scale , and the cutoff , a regime where @xmath6 .",
    "when studying heavy quarks , it may be interesting to introduce a massive scheme , i.e. a scheme where the renormalization conditions are imposed at some finite value of the renormalized mass .",
    "it is indeed possible to choose the renormalization conditions in such a way that the desirable properties of the massless schemes are preserved , in particular the ward identities would hold exactly at finite values of the quark mass , and independently of the ratio @xmath3 .    in this paper , we define a massive scheme for axial and vector currents as well as scalar and pseudoscalar densities , which we call msmom .",
    "the renormalization constants defined in msmom satisfy properties that are similar to the ones found in smom  @xcite .",
    "smom was introduced in order to reduce chiral symmetry breaking and other unwanted infrared effects , by defining the renormalization conditions for the vertex functions at a symmetric subtraction point which involves non - exceptional momenta .",
    "the key property of the smom scheme is that the renormalization conditions are defined so that the renormalized wis are satisfied .",
    "this is in contrast with mom where the wi for the axial current are recovered only for large values of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "starting from smom , we modify some of the renormalization conditions in order to recover the massive renormalized wis .",
    "the renormalization conditions for massive quarks require the introduction of an extra scale @xmath8 , which is the value of the renormalized mass at which the conditions are spelled out .",
    "as we take the limit @xmath9 , our scheme reduces to smom , so that we are able to interpolate between massive and massless schemes .",
    "we discuss a number of properties using non - perturbative arguments after which we perform an explicit check at one - loop in perturbation theory using dimensional regularization . while the results of this calculation is exactly as expected",
    ", it is pleasing to see explicitly a number of nontrivial cancellations .",
    "we then focus on the case of the lattice currents , and discuss their renormalization in msmom .",
    "the massive schemes can be implemented numerically , in order to obtain nonperturbative determinations of the corresponding renormalization constants .",
    "the massive renormalization constants will change some lattice artefacts @xmath10 , and could potentially lead to smoother extrapolations to the continuum limit of phenomenologically relevant observables . a first qualitative understanding of the can be obtained by a perturbative study along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , but ultimately dedicated numerical studies are necessary in order to settle this issue .",
    "a regularization independent momentum subtraction scheme for bilinears with a nonexceptional , symmetric point has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , under the name of ri / smom .",
    "ri / smom is a mass - independent renormalization scheme , in that all the renormalization conditions are specified in the chiral limit , and therefore the renormalization constants can not depend on the quark masses by definition . before investigating the possibility of defining a similar scheme at finite quark mass ,",
