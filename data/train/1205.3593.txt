    "a straight drift - quadrupole system can not be designed in such a way that a particle transport through it will not depend on the difference in particle energies and this dependence can not be removed even in first order with respect to the energy deviations . nevertheless , the situation will change if instead of comparing the dynamics of individual particles one will compare the results of tracking of monoenergetic particle ensembles through the system or will look at chromatic distortions of the betatron functions appearing after their transport through the system . from this point of view , as it was proven in  @xcite , for every drift - quadrupole system there exists an unique set of twiss parameters ( apochromatic twiss parameters ) , which will be transported through that system without first order chromatic distortions . in this paper",
    "we continue the study of the apochromatic properties of straight drift - quadrupole systems and present the design of a beamline which can transport apochromatic beam ellipses without influence of the second and of the third order chromatic and geometric aberrations of the beamline transfer map .",
    "we consider the beam dynamics in a magnetostatic system and , as usual , take the path length along the reference orbit @xmath0 to be the independent variable .",
    "we use a complete set of symplectic variables @xmath1 as particle coordinates . here",
    "@xmath2 measure the transverse displacements from the ideal orbit and @xmath3 are transverse canonical monenta scaled with the constant kinetic momentum of the reference particle @xmath4 . the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 which describe longitudinal dynamics are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy of the reference particle , its velocity in terms of the speed of light @xmath10 and its arrival time at a certain position @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we represent particle transport from the location @xmath12 to the location @xmath13 by a symplectic map @xmath14 and assume that the point @xmath15 is the fixed point and that the map @xmath14 can be taylor expanded in its neighborhood .",
    "additionally we assume that the transverse motion is dispersion free ( always true for the drift - quadrupole systems ) and uncoupled in linear approximation , which is a restriction on the form of the @xmath16 symplectic matrix @xmath17 which represents the linear part of the map @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath18 be some function of the variables @xmath19 given at the system entrance .",
    "then its image @xmath20 at the system exit under the action of the map @xmath14 is given by the following relation    @xmath21    which symbolically we will write as @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider some courant - snyder quadratic forms    @xmath23    we say that the map @xmath14 is an @xmath24-order ( @xmath25 ) apochromat with respect to the incoming courant - snyder quadratic forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 if    @xmath28    i.e. if the chromatic and geometric distortions to the shapes of the ellipses @xmath29 after the system passage come only from nonlinear map aberrations which are of the order @xmath30 and higher .",
    "we call the twiss parameters that enter the courant - snyder quadratic forms satisfying ( [ ifb_3 ] ) apochromatic twiss parameters .    up to any predefined order @xmath24 the aberrations of the map @xmath14",
    "can be represented through a lie factorization as    @xmath31    where each of the functions @xmath32 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath33 in the variables @xmath19 and the symbol @xmath34 denotes equality up to order @xmath24 ( inclusive ) when maps on both sides of ( [ ifb_4 ] ) are applied to the phase space vector @xmath19 .    using the representation ( [ ifb_4 ] ) we can state that the magnetostatic system is an @xmath24-order apochromat with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 if , and only if , all homogeneous polynomials @xmath32 in the lie exponential representation ( [ ifb_4 ] ) of the system transfer map can be expressed as functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 only .",
    "the straight drift - quadrupole cell is a magnetostatic system which is symmetric about both , the horizontal midplane @xmath37 and the vertical midplane @xmath38 .",
    "it means that in the lie exponential representation of the cell map    @xmath39    the polynomials @xmath40 do not depend on the variable @xmath41 and are even functions of the variables @xmath42 and of the variables @xmath43 .",
    "if the drift - quadrupole cell is not a pure drift space , then the structure of the polynomial @xmath44 , which is responsible for the second - order map aberrations , can be further clarified using the concept of the apochromatic twiss parameters .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the cell apochromatic twiss parameters and let @xmath48 be the corresponding courant - snyder quadratic forms .",
    "then the polynomial @xmath49 can be written as follows    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the cell length , @xmath53 is the lorentz factor of the reference particle , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the cell chromaticities calculated for the apochromatic twiss parameters ( see more details in  @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a system constructed by a repetition of @xmath56 identical drift - quadrupole cells and let us assume that the horizontal and vertical transfer matrices of the @xmath56-cell system are equal to the plus or minus identity matrices , but the horizontal and vertical cell focusing matrices are not equal to the plus or minus identity matrices .",
    "then , as it was shown in  @xcite , the shape distorting effects of the second - order aberrations of the cell map on the transport of the cell periodic courant - snyder quadratic forms are washed out at the exit of the @xmath56-cell system by averaging . in other words , it means that under the assumptions made the @xmath56-cell system is a second - order apochromat with respect to the cell periodic courant - snyder quadratic forms . and , as we will show below , the idea of the usage of averaging provided by repetition of @xmath56 identical cells for automatic cancellation of undesired effects can also be applied to the design of a third - order apochromat if the cell periodic twiss parameters coincide with the cell apochromatic twiss parameters .",
    "so , let us start with the assumption that the cell transfer matrix allows periodic beam transport and that the cell periodic twiss parameters are , at the same time , the cell apochromatic twiss parameters",
    ". then the map of the repetitive @xmath56-cell system can be expressed as follows    @xmath57    where the homogeneous polynomials ( aberration functions ) @xmath58 are given by the formulas    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    the binary operation @xmath62 is the poisson bracket ,    @xmath63    @xmath64 } ( n + 1 - 2 m ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath65    and the symbol @xmath66 $ ] denotes the biggest integer which is smaller or equal to @xmath33 .",
    "our second assumption is that the periodic cell phase advances @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy    @xmath69    for some integer or half integer @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are smaller than @xmath56 and are such that the resonances    @xmath72    are avoided . from this assumption",
    "it follows that the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( as a result of averaging provided by the operator @xmath75 ) can be expressed as functions of the variables @xmath76 and @xmath6 only , and thus the @xmath56-cell beamline becomes a third - order apochromat with respect to the cell periodic courant - snyder quadratic forms @xmath77 .",
    "note that the minimal number of cells required for the construction of the third - order apochromatic beamline following the above recipe is five , and that the first distortions to the shapes of the courant - snyder ellipses @xmath76 after the system passage are due to forth - order aberrations of the map @xmath78 generated by the function @xmath79 .",
    "to complete the third - order apochromat design we need a drift - quadrupole cell with the coinciding periodic and apochromatic twiss parameters and with the phase advances satisfying the conditions ( [ repcelltunes_1_1 ] ) and ( [ repcelltunes_1_7 ] ) .",
    "what is the minimum number of quadrupoles which are required for such a cell to exist ? using thin - lens approximation for quadrupole focusing one can show that this number can not be smaller than four , and with four quadrupoles we have many examples ( found by direct numerical search using hard - edge quadrupole models ) of the cells which satisfy all needed requirements .",
    "the parameters of one such cell are given in the table 1 and its periodic ( and apochromatic ) betatron functions can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical phase advances of this cell are equal to @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively , which means that the sequence of five such cells gives a third - order apochromatic beamline .",
    "the total number of quadrupoles in our third - order apochromatic beamline is twenty , and it is interesting to compare its beam transfer properties with the beam transport through the chain of ten fodo cells which also has twenty quadrupoles and which is designed to have the same length and about the same average betatron functions .",
    "we chose for such comparison not one but three different fodo beamlines with the cell phase advances equal to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see , for example fig.2 ) .",
    "the first and the third fodo beamlines have the phase advances which are equal to the half of the vertical and of the horizontal phase advances of our apochromatic four quadrupole cell respectively and , at the same time , are second - order apochromats . the second fodo beamline is taken because , from one side",
    ", its phase advance @xmath84 lies in between the phase advances of the two other beamlines , but , from the other side , its overall phase advance is not multiple of @xmath86 and , therefore , it is not a second - order apochromat .        because it is not easy to find a single quantity which will characterize in a clear and general way the effect of aberrations which are nonlinear in the transverse variables",
    ", we will restrict our comparison to the study of the beam dynamics provided by the hamiltonian                for each beamline , for each transverse plane and for each energy offset we track the nominal beamline twiss parameters ( twiss parameters which are periodic for the nominal energy ) through the system and , at the system exit , characterize the accumulated chromatic effects by calculating first the mismatch parameter @xmath91 and then the mismatch amplitude      which is a measure of the created optics distortion .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in fig.3 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the horizontal and vertical mismatch amplitudes of the third - order apochromat and for each fodo chain only one curve is presented , because for the fodo beamlines the horizontal and vertical mismatch amplitudes coincide .",
    "one sees , as expected , that our third - order apochromatic beamline demonstrates the best performance and the next comes the second - order apochromats with @xmath83 and @xmath85 cell phase advances ."
