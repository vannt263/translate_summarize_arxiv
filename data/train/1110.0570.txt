    "the phenomenon of liquid helium ( lhe ) scintillation due to passage of charged particles was discovered in the late 1950 s  @xcite .",
    "since then rather extensive studies have been conducted , motivated both by its intrinsic interest ( including an interest in illuminating the behavior of ions and neutrals in superfluid helium ) and by the application of liquid helium as a particle detector  @xcite .",
    "( for a brief review of early work , see ref .",
    "@xcite . a more recent review",
    "can be found in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the following picture has emerged from these studies as the process for liquid helium scintillation production ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) : when a charged particle passes through liquid helium , it deposits energy to the medium , part of which goes to ionization , creating electron - ion pairs along its track .",
    "the deposited energy also goes to promoting atoms to excited states .",
    "the @xmath2 value , the average energy required to produce one electron - ion pair , in liquid helium is @xmath3  ev  @xcite .",
    "electrons and ions then thermalize with the liquid helium . the electron subsequently forms a `` bubble '' in the liquid , pushing away surrounding helium atoms as a consequence of pauli exclusion . the he@xmath4 ion , on the other hand , forms a `` helium snowball '' attracting surrounding helium atoms . the bubbles and snowballs then recombine quickly ( @xmath5  s ) forming excited helium molecules ( excimers ) .",
    "the molecules are formed in the triplet and singlet states .",
    "the lowest - energy singlet state molecule , he@xmath6(a@xmath7 ) , radiatively decays in less than 10@xmath8 s to the ( unbound ) ground state , emitting a @xmath9  ev extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) photon , contributing to the prompt component of scintillation .",
    "excited atoms in singlet states also contribute to the prompt scintillation signal .",
    "the triplet state molecule , he@xmath6(a@xmath10 ) , on the other hand , has a lifetime of @xmath11  s in liquid helium  @xcite . in a high excitation density environment , however , the triplet state excimers can also be destroyed through the penning ionization process @xmath12 or @xmath13 if a singlet excimer is formed as a result of penning ionization after the first @xmath14 s , then it makes a contribution to the delayed scintillation component .",
    "the study of liquid helium scintillation has been conducted using radioactive sources , such as @xmath15 , conversion electron , and @xmath0 sources as well as electron beams .",
    "there were also experiments that studied liquid helium scintillation induced by the products of the @xmath16he(@xmath17,@xmath18)@xmath16h reaction  @xcite .",
    "various characteristics of the scintillation light depend on the type of ionizing particles employed . when a @xmath15 or conversion electron source is used , the scintillation light yield is known not to show a strong temperature dependence , whereas when the scintillation is induced by @xmath0 particles , the scintillation yield does exhibit a temperature dependence .",
    "in addition , a difference in time dependence of the scintillation signal has been observed between @xmath0-induced scintillation and @xmath15-induced scintillation  @xcite : @xmath0-induced scintillation light shows a long lived component that decays with a @xmath19 dependence following the prompt pulse .",
    "this slow component shows up as a series of single photoelectron ( pe ) pulses following the prompt pulse in an experiment in which the euv scintillation is wavelength - shifted and detected using a photomultiplier ( pmt ) .",
    "( thus these single pe pulses are called `` afterpulses '' . ) a typical pmt oscilloscope trace from our experiment described in this paper is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmtsignal ] .",
    "one distinct difference between @xmath0 tracks and electron tracks is the ionization density .",
    "for example , a 5.5-mev @xmath0 particle deposits energy into superfluid liquid helium ( @xmath20  g / cm@xmath16 ) at a rate of @xmath22  ev/@xmath23 m on average along its 0.27  mm long track  ev/@xmath23 m and occurs when the remaining kinetic energy is 0.65  mev . ] , whereas for a 500  kev electron , the average energy deposition rate is 40  ev/@xmath23 m  @xcite . with @xmath24",
    "ev , it follows that ionization events are separated by an average distance of @xmath25  nm and @xmath26  nm in @xmath0 and electron tracks , respectively . with an average separation of several tens of nanometers between the electron and its parent ion  @xcite , ionization events in @xmath0 tracks overlap with each other whereas electron - ion pairs are well separated in electron tracks . as we will discuss later ,",
    "many of the differences in the characteristics between @xmath0-induced scintillation and electron - induced scintillation can be attributed to the difference in the ionization density . although the amount of data on lhe scintillation induced by protons and tritons from the @xmath16he(@xmath17,@xmath18)@xmath16h reaction is rather limited",
    ", it shows qualitatively similar characteristics to @xmath0-induced scintillation because of the high ionization density of the proton and triton tracks .    in establishing the picture described above , a study of scintillation in the presence of an electric field played an important role .",
    "the effect of an electric field on the lhe scintillation was first studied by hereford and moss  @xcite . in this study",
    ", the authors measured both the intensity of @xmath0-particle - induced scintillation and the ionization current extracted from the @xmath0 tracks in the presence of an electric field ( 9 to 43  kv / cm ) in the temperature range of 1.23 to 4.2  k. the scintillation signal was integrated over @xmath27  @xmath23s .",
    "they observed a decrease in the scintillation intensity and a corresponding increase in the ionization current with an increasing electric field particle . ] .",
    "we have extended their work and have studied the effect of an application of an electric field on both the prompt scintillation and afterpulses in the temperature range of 0.2  k to 1.1  k with an electric field up to @xmath28  kv / cm .",
    "we measured the time dependence of the scintillation signal up to 14  @xmath23s .",
    "the research reported here is directed primarily towards an understanding of the physical processes underlying the electric field dependence of the scintillation yield of liquid helium .",
    "it provides information on the dynamics of the charged particles generated by the passage of an alpha particle through helium and the interaction of molecular species produced on recombination .",
    "however , the work is motivated by the desire to use helium scintillation in the presence of a high electric field in the nedm experiment  @xcite .",
    "the nedm experiment , currently being developed to be mounted at the spallation neutron source at the oak ridge national laboratory , will search for the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) using a method proposed by golub and lamoreaux  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "spin polarized ultra cold neutrons will be produced and stored in a volume filled with superfluid helium , to which spin polarized @xmath16he atoms will be added as cohabiting magnetometer .",
    "lhe scintillation produced by the reaction products of the spin - dependent @xmath16he(@xmath17,@xmath18)@xmath16h reaction will be used to analyze the spin of the neutrons .",
    "the signature of a non - zero edm is a shift in the neutron precession frequency upon application of an electric field .",
    "therefore , the effects of an electric field on lhe scintillation produced by heavy particles such as protons , tritons , and @xmath0 particles are of particular interest . an earlier study performed by part of the nedm collaboration on lhe scintillation produced by the products of neutron capture on @xmath16he",
    "was reported in ref .",
    "the experiment was performed using a leiden cryogenics model cf-600 cryogen - free dilution refrigerator  @xcite , which had a measured cooling power of 1.8  mw at 0.2  k. a measurement cell , which housed the electrodes immersed in lhe , was mounted on the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator ( dr ) .",
    "an @xmath29am @xmath0 source was electroplated on the ground electrode .",
    "@xmath0 particles from the source induced scintillation light in the volume of lhe between the electrodes .",
    "the euv scintillation light was converted to blue light by a wavelength shifter , then was guided through a light guide to the viewport at the bottom of the measurement cell and to a pmt mounted outside the measurement cell in vacuum . a description of each component is given below .",

    "the measurement cell was made of a stainless steel cross with 4 - 5/8  and 4 - 3/4  conflat flanges attached to its ends .",
    "the volume of the lhe inside the cell was approximately 600  ml . at the top of the cell was a heat exchanger made of stack of gold - coated copper plates , which provided cooling from the mixing chamber to the lhe inside the cell .",
    "the electrodes were made of stainless steel .",
    "the ground electrode was 19.05  mm in diameter and 6.35  mm in thickness , and had an edge rounded with a radius of 3.175  mm .",
    "the high voltage ( hv ) electrode was 19.05  mm in diameter and 12.7  mm in thickness , and had an edge rounded with a radius of 6.35  mm .",
    "the gap between the electrodes was approximately 4  mm .",
    "the hv electrode was mounted on a commercially made hv vacuum feedthrough .",
    "the hv was supplied by a glassman high voltage inc .",

    "a thin wall stainless steel tubing was used as the hv wire inside the cryostat to reduce the heat load . a hv resistor ( @xmath30  g@xmath31 or @xmath30  m@xmath31 ) needed to be inserted in series in the hv cable , in order to reduce the noise on the pmt signal induced by the ripple of the hv power supply for the hv electrode .",
    "the capacitance of the hv cable and this resistor formed a low pass filter , which reduced the effect of the ripple to a sufficiently low level .",
    "approximately 300  bq of @xmath29am was electroplated on the ground electrode .",
    "the activity had a diameter of 6  mm . because the range of 5.5  mev @xmath0 particles in superfluid liquid helium is only @xmath32  mm , the ionization due to @xmath0 particles occurred in a region very close to the surface of the ground electrode .",
    "the electric field at the location of the ionization was uniform to 5% .",
    "larger electrodes and a smaller gap would have given a more uniform electric field at the location of the ionization .",
    "however , that would have , at the same time , significantly reduced the fraction of euv photons detected and hence the detection efficiency by limiting the solid angle subtended at the location of the ionization by the wavelength - shifter - coated surface .",
    "the size and shape of the electrodes were chosen as a compromise between electric field uniformity and the detection efficiency .",
    "the electrodes were enclosed in a sleeve made of g10 .",
    "this was to prevent possible hv breakdowns due to the hv electrode seeing structures on the inner walls of the stainless steel measurement cell .",
    "a sapphire viewport with a view diameter of 49.3  mm was mounted at the bottom of the measurement cell .",
    "an acrylic light guide with a diameter of 49.3  mm and a length of 30.5  mm was mounted between the viewport and the g10 sleeve .",
    "the g10 sleeve had a 48  mm diameter hole on the side to allow the scintillation light to reach the light guide .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a hamamatsu r7725 pmt , modified for cryogenic use with a pt underlayer  @xcite , was mounted underneath the viewport in vacuum .",
    "a fraction of the @xmath0 particle induced euv light emitted from the region between the electrodes was converted to blue light at the top surface of the light guide .",
    "the blue light was then guided towards the pmt through the light guide , transmitted through the sapphire viewport and then detected by the pmt .",
    "the fraction of the euv light that reached the tpb coated surface of the light guide was about 5% ( determined by the solid angle subtended by the coated surface of the light guide at the location of scintillation events ) .",
    "the overall detection efficiency of the apparatus (= the number of detected pes per emitted euv photon ) was estimated to be @xmath33 from the solid angle mentioned above ( 5% ) , the euv to visible conversion efficiency ( @xmath34%  @xcite ) , the estimated transport efficiency of the visible light ( @xmath35% ) , and the pmt s quantum efficiency ( 18%  @xcite ) . the observed number of pes in the prompt pulse in the absence of an electric field @xmath36 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : adcanalysis ] ) was consistent with the expectation based on the known scintillation efficiency (= the number of euv photons in the prompt pulse per energy deposition )  @xcite and the estimated detection efficiency .",
    "the pmt was thermally anchored to the 3  k plate of the dr , which was cooled by a pulse - tube refrigerator , in order to reduce heat load , both radiative and conductive , to the measurement cell .",

    "the resistor chain was heat - sunk on the 3  k plate . in order to reduce the heat load from the joule heating of the resistor chain , a resistor value 10 times larger than the manufacturer recommended value was used .",
    "because of the low event rate ( @xmath37  s@xmath38 ) , this did not affect the performance of the pmt .",
    "the rest of the base circuit , which consisted mostly of capacitors , was mounted at the back of the pmt .",
    "previously , this pmt model had been demonstrated to function properly at temperatures down to @xmath39  k  @xcite .",
    "the present work showed that it functions properly at @xmath40  k.    there were two ruo@xmath6 temperature sensors mounted on the g10 sleeve to monitor the temperature of the lhe inside the measurement cell .",

    "when increasing or decreasing the hv , the pmt was kept turned off to protect the pmt from being exposed to bright flashes of light due to hv breakdowns , which occurred occasionally when changing the hv setting ; we had found that exposing the pmt to flashes of light from hv breakdowns decreased the pmt gain and the change appeared to be permanent .",

    "the excimers propagate ballistically into the cold liquid in the absence of scattering .",
    "the excimer density drops much more rapidly at low temperatures and as a consequence the rate of generation of singlet species by the penning process is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "the strong electric field dependence of the @xmath19 component of the afterpulse results from the two separate ionization steps that are involved in the production of these photons .",

    "secondly , the recombination of the electron - ion pair produced by the penning process involving the triplet excimers is also influenced by the electric field .",

    "since the average energy of electrons created by the penning process responsible for the @xmath19 afterpulse component is comparable to the average energy of secondary electrons from an alpha , the inclusion of the inertial term in describing the ion motion does not provide a satisfactory explanation to the field dependence .    at low temperatures and at zero pressure both positive ion snowballs and electron bubbles moving in liquid helium create quantized vortex rings  @xcite when their velocities reach the order of 60 m / s .",
    "since ion mobilities are the order of @xmath140  m@xmath142v@xmath85s , at 1  k , fields of less than 1 kv / cm are sufficient for vortex creation . at low fields the charges remain attached to the rings that they have produced , but in very high fields , greater than 25 kv / cm at low temperatures , it has been found  @xcite that electrons no longer remain attached to vortices but create and shed vortex rings as they move through the superfluid .    we have not attempted to apply the theory of vortex creation by moving ions  @xcite to explain the field dependence of the @xmath19 component of the afterpulses . the energy a charge acquires in moving in the field is transferred to the vortex , which increases its diameter and decreases its velocity .",
    "qualitatively , the vortices introduce an enormous drag on the motion of the ions , which has the effect of retarding their separation by the applied field .",
    "presumably vortices are the reason the field dependence of the afterpulses produced by penning ionization is not stronger than observed .",
    "the constant component of the afterpulses , independent of time , is most naturally associated with triplet excimers whose density is constant and are uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the cell , the rate of destruction being balanced by the production from the 300  bq @xmath0 source .",
    "destruction occurs in part by the spontaneous radiative decay of triplet excimers to the dissociated ground state and in part by the penning process .",
