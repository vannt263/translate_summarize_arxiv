    "examples are the barkhausen noise in magnets @xcite , jumps in the creep motion of magnetic domain walls @xcite , avalanches in the depinning of a contact - line of a fluid @xcite , or in dislocation and crack propagation @xcite , and stick - slip motion of e.g.  tectonic plates , responsible for earthquakes @xcite .",
    "avalanches have also been studied in models without quenched substrate disorder , such as in sandpile models and in granular matter @xcite .",

    ". pinned elastic manifolds are an important prototype of a much wider class of phenomena , reaching far outside physics , e.g.  into economy and finance , where extreme ( and sometimes catastrophic ) events are sufficiently frequent and large to dominate most observables . in this context , it is clearly of importance to understand how the avalanche - size probability is cut off at the large scales , for @xmath20 .",
    "although avalanche motion of pinned manifolds has been studied for a while in numerics @xcite , most work focused on measuring the avalanche - size exponent @xmath8 , with minimal guidance from the theory .",
    "this is mainly because no analytic approach was available besides mean - field and scaling arguments .",
    "the most notable one was proposed by narayan and fisher ( nf ) @xcite on the basis of the unproved assumption that the avalanche density remains finite at the depinning threshold , resulting into @xmath21 here @xmath6 is the roughness exponent at the depinning transition .",
    "progress both in constructing the field theory of the depinning transition @xcite following the pioneering work on the functional rg ( frg)@xcite and in developing new powerful algorithms @xcite had focused mostly on structural properties of the pinned manifold , such as the precise determination of @xmath6 .",
    "even an appropriate definition of static and dynamic avalanches , allowing contact with the field theory , had remained unclear .",
    "it was given in the statics @xcite and at depinning @xcite using a confining quadratic potential ; it led to the measurement , with great accuracy , of the renormalized disorder correlator @xmath22 , i.e.  the fixed point of the frg .",
    "only very recently we succeeded in computing the distribution of avalanche sizes within the frg @xcite .",
    "the calculation at tree level gave mean - field predictions ( some of them new and non - trivial ) , valid above the upper critical dimension @xmath23 , i.e.  for @xmath24 .",
    "the one - loop calculation gave an expansion to order @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "remarkably , the conjecture ( [ conj ] ) was confirmed to @xmath25 accuracy .",
    "it is thus of great interest to test these predictions in numerics .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute numerically the jumps ( avalanches ) between successively pinned configurations of an elastic line ( @xmath1 ) and interface ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the convenient setting to compare with the recent predictions from the frg is to submit the manifold to an external quadratic well , i.e.  a spring .",
    "we will study mostly random - field disorder , but we also check that the results are the same for random - bond disorder , as is predicted at depinning and was checked in our previous work @xcite for the renormalized disorder correlator @xmath22 .",

    "the reader will find our numerical results for the avalanche - size distribution , and their comparison to our analytical results in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section [ s:5 ]",
    "we compare our numerical and analytical results for the universal ratios of algebraic moments , the @xmath27 . in section [ s:6 ]",
    "we do the same for the generating function of exponential moments , i.e.  the characteristic function of the size distribution , denoted @xmath28 , in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . finally , in section ( [ sec : local ] ) , we compute the distribution of local avalanches in @xmath1 and compare with the predictions .",
    "let us now describe the model and algorithm , in @xmath1 for simplicity .",

    "the value of the random force for non - integer values of @xmath36 is given by the linear interpolation of the forces at the two closest integers @xmath37 .",

    "we have compared this mean - field prediction and the numerical results in @xmath1 , @xmath198 on figure [ f : zhat ] .",
    "it is clear that loop corrections , yet to be computed , will play an important role , as was the case for bulk avalanches , see fig .",
    "the function @xmath229 , as defined here , is found to be @xcite in mean field ( i.e.  at tree level ) @xmath234 it satisfies the normalizations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , and is related to @xmath235 via @xmath236 .",
    "finally , the mean - field calculation @xcite also gives : @xmath237 corrections at 1-loop order slightly decrease this ratio .",
    "the @xmath118 expansion predicts @xcite @xmath238 with @xmath239 and @xmath240 here .",
    "using the two pad approximants gives the estimate @xmath241 which is consistent with the numerically observed value of @xmath242 for @xmath199 , @xmath243 .",
    "in this article , we have compared the numerically obtained avalanche - size statistics at the depinning transition with the recent predictions from the functional rg based on an @xmath26 expansion .",
    "the critical point of the depinning transition for an interface of internal dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , driven quasi - statically in a random landscape in presence of an external quadratic well of curvature @xmath3 , is reached in the limit of @xmath244 .",
    "we have shown that the avalanche - size distribution @xmath72 takes the expected scaling form with the upper cutoff scale @xmath245 , involving a universal function @xmath82 in the rescaled variable @xmath246 .",
    "as we confirmed , it does not depend on whether the microscopic disorder is of random - field or random - bond type .",
    "we have computed numerically the function @xmath82 , its moments and its characteristic function and found in all cases good to excellent agreement with the predictions of the 1-loop frg based on the extrapolation to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have also studied , for @xmath1 , the _ local _ avalanches , and there too , we found a rather satisfactory agreement with available analytical predictions .",
    "however , it remains an outstanding challenge to compute the local avalanche - size distribution within the frg beyond mean - field .",
    "some fine points deserve discussion and further study .",
    "first we have not found any clear - cut signature that the conjecture for the avalanche exponent @xmath8 be violated at depinning .",
    "however , we can not rule out such a violation below a @xmath104 precision in @xmath8 . a better numerical determination of @xmath8 , comparable in precision to the one which exists for the roughness @xmath6 at @xmath64 would be crucial to confirm or invalidate the conjectured relation between @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "presently , the mass , i.e.  the quadratic well , appears necessary for a proper definition of the steady state , but unfortunately , this hampers the attempts at a more precise determination of @xmath8 .",
    "second , there has been a recent proposal , in the case of the random - field ising model @xcite , that avalanche - size distributions for statics and depinning are described by the same universal functions .",
    "although the physics underlying this hypothesis is not clear to us , one may still ask the question for the present model . for the class of short - range correlated forces ( random field class ) where one finds on one hand the sinai - model class in the statics @xcite and on the other , the gumbel extremal statistics class at depinning @xcite , with vastly different distributions in each class . ]",
    "one may for instance compare our present results to the one in the statics in @xcite .",
    "currently , our precision is not sufficient to conclude .",
    "for instance , in @xmath2 and for rf disorder , the conjecture ( [ conj ] ) for @xmath8 gives @xmath247 for the statics and @xmath248 for depinning , which are difficult to distinguish numerically .",
    "we simply note that both statics and depinning data are in good agreement with extrapolations from the 1-loop frg @xcite , but it remains to be analyzed at two loops . as noted previously , since the roughness exponents are different , if the conjecture holds both in the statics and driven dynamics , then the avalanche - size exponents , and presumably the associated distributions , can not be the same .",
    "we leave these subtle questions for the future .    to conclude , it is highly satisfactory that the functional - rg field theory for the avalanche statistics passes all numerical tests .",
    "other interesting observables can now be computed numerically , and studied on a more solid footing , such as the distribution of lateral sizes , or correlations between avalanches .",
    "these provide a motivation to further develop the theory .",
    "finally we hope that our present work will motivate similar studies in experiments ."
