    "interacting spin systems in two dimensions have been widely studied over the last decades , both from experimental and theoretical points of view . of importance in this context",
    "is the so - called resonating valence bond approach put forward by p.  w.  anderson in 1973 @xcite in order to analyze the physics of spin 1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "this has later been advocated as a way to study the yet unsolved problem of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "following rokhsar and kivelson @xcite , it proves interesting , when studying the low energy properties of these phases , to consider a simpler model , called the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) . in the latter ,",
    "the @xmath0 singlet bonds are replaced by hard core dimers defined on the edges of the lattice .",
    "quantum dimer models have been employed to study for example superconductivity @xcite , frustrated magnets @xcite , or hardcore bosons @xcite .",
    "they can feature topological order , spin liquid phases , and deconfined fractional excitations @xcite .    before enlarging on the quantum systems ,",
    "let us say a few words about the classical case .",
    "lattice dimer coverings  the basis states of the hilbert space in the quantum case  represent already a rich mathematical problem with many connections to statistical physics problems . for a graph defined by its vertices and edges ( defining faces , often called plaquettes in the present context ) , a dimer covering is a decoration of the bonds , such that every vertex is reached by exactly one dimer .",
    "the simplest rearrangement mechanism for dimer coverings is provided by so - called plaquette flips .",
    "these are applicable for plaquettes around which every second bond has a dimer and the flip amounts to exchanging covered and uncovered bonds , yielding a different valid dimer covering ( e.g. , @xmath1{fig001 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=2ex]{fig001 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=1.5ex]{fig001 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=1ex]{fig001 } } } } } } \\longleftrightarrow { \\ensuremath {    \\mathchoice{\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=2ex]{fig002 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=2ex]{fig002 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=1.5ex]{fig002 } } } }      { \\vcenter{\\hbox{includegraphics[height=1ex]{dimerdown } } } } } } $ ] for a hexagonal lattice ) .",
    "dimer coverings are closely related to other configurational problems . for the hexagonal lattice ,",
    "these are ground - state configurations of a classical ising - spin model with antiferromagnetic interactions on the ( dual ) triangular lattice , planar rhombus tilings , and height models @xcite .",
    "topological sectors can be characterized by so - called fluxes ( see below ) .",
    "these sectors are invariant under the flips .",
    "the topological properties depend for example on the boundary conditions and have consequences on the physics of the quantum dimer model .",
    "the quantum version , as proposed by rokhsar and kivelson , corresponds to considering the set of all dimer coverings of the classical problem as an orthonormal basis spanning the hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian contains kinetic terms that correspond precisely to the elementary flips described above and an additional potential term , proportional to the number of flippable plaquettes .",
    "the competition between these kinetic and potential terms leads to a non - trivial phase diagram .",
    "for example , when the potential term dominates in amplitude and is of negative sign , the ground state is expected to be dominated by configurations which maximize the number of flippable plaquettes ; for the opposite sign , one expects a ground state dominated by dimer configurations without flippable plaquettes . as will be discussed , such configurations exist and correspond to the so - called star and staggered phases , respectively . in - between these two extremes ,",
    "the phase diagram can display intermediary phases .",
    "the ground state is known exactly for the point where kinetic and potential terms are of equal strength .",
    "the physics around this so - called rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) point is expected to be different for bipartite and non - bipartite lattices @xcite .    in this paper , we provide an extensive study of the quantum dimer model on the bipartite hexagonal ( honeycomb ) lattice along the lines already followed by moessner et al .  @xcite . in their seminal work , these authors numerically investigated the phase diagram by studying a local order parameter which , in addition to the generic rk transition point , shows a first order transition which separates the star phase from an intermediary phase , the so - called plaquette phase .",

    ".  argued that the plaquette phase should be gapped  a point which conflicts with an earlier analytical analysis @xcite .",
    "in the present work we use quantum monte carlo simulations to extend the numerical work by studying order parameters for different system sizes and temperatures as well as ground - state energies and excitation gaps which we obtain from imaginary - time correlation functions .",
    "this leads to a clear confirmation of the gapped nature of the plaquette phase .",

    "three phases belonging to two different topological sectors have been described .",
    "the ground states for the so - called star phase ( @xmath23 ) and the plaquette phase ( @xmath24 ) are found in the zero flux sector , while the staggered phase ground states ( @xmath25 ) are in the highest flux sector .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : examples - of - dimer ] .",
    "the ground states in the zero flux sector can be distinguished using sublattice dimer densities . for that purpose , we recall that the plaquettes of the hexagonal lattice can be separated into three subsets  triangular sublattices @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 of disjoint plaquettes , as depicted in fig .",

    "the physics of the quantum ising model is restricted to the subspace spanned by the classical ground states .",

    "the identification of dimer basis states and ising basis states is then straightforward . given a certain dimer configuration , put a spin up on an arbitrary site .",
    "associating frustrated ising bonds with those that are crossed by a dimer in the given state , we can work inward - out , assigning further ising spins till the triangular lattice is filled .",
    "the state , up or down , for a new site depends on the spin state of an already assigned neighboring site and on whether the corresponding bond is frustrated or not .",
    "this mapping of dimer configurations on the hexagonal lattice to spin-@xmath2 configurations on the triangular lattice implies that , for the quantum ising model , we employ the conventional inner product @xmath4 that makes different @xmath35-eigenstates orthonormal . in the hamiltonian ,",
    "the spin - flip terms @xmath6 correspond to the kinetic term in the quantum dimer model . due to the energetic constraint imposed by @xmath38 , they are only effective for sites where the spin flip does not change the number of of frustrated bonds , corresponding to the flippable plaquettes in the dimer model .",
    "the term @xmath7 corresponds exactly to the potential term in the dimer model .",
    "the equivalence of the two models is slightly complicated by two issues .",
    "first , as we are free to choose the orientation of the first assigned spin , a given dimer configuration corresponds to two spin configurations that differ by a global spin - flip .",
    "second , periodic boundary conditions correspond , for certain topological sectors of dimer configurations , to anti - periodic boundary conditions in the ising model .      to apply world - line quantum monte carlo @xcite , we can approximate the partition function and observables of the quantum ising model on the 2d triangular lattice by those of a 3d classical ising model on a stack of 2d triangular lattices by a trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite .",
    "to this purpose , we separate the hamiltonian into two parts @xmath39 as detailed in appendix  [ appx : qim_to_cim ] , one can use the trotter - suzuki decomposition @xmath40 of the density operator with imaginary - time step @xmath41 to determine the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the classical ising model @xmath44 such that the partition functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the two models coincide ( up to a known constant @xmath14 ) ,    [ eq : equal_z ] @xmath47^{ln/2 } , \\label{eq : factor_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as well as expectation values of observables @xmath48 that are diagonal in the in the @xmath35-eigenbasis ,    [ eq : equal_obs ] @xmath49    in these equations , @xmath50 is a vector of classical spin configurations @xmath51 on the triangular lattice @xmath52 for each of the imaginary - time slices @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the number of lattice sites @xmath8 in @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ appx : qim_to_cim ] , the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the classical ising model are given by @xmath55      the representation of expectation values of quantum observables as expectation values of classical observables is of great value , as it can be evaluated efficiently with a monte carlo algorithm by sampling classical states @xmath56 .",
    "specifically , one generates a markov chain of classical states @xmath56 with probabilities @xmath57 and averages @xmath58 over these states .    the most simple scheme would be to choose in every iteration of the algorithm one of the flippable spins ( a spin on site @xmath12 of time slice @xmath59 is flippable , iff @xmath60 ) , compute the energy difference @xmath61 that the flipping of the spin would cause , and flip it with a probability that is given by the so - called metropolis rule as detailed in appendix  [ appx : mc ] .",
    "however , as one increases the accuracy by reducing @xmath62 ( for a fixed inverse temperature @xmath63 ) , the coupling @xmath64 between the time slices increases with @xmath65 and the classical ising model , hence , becomes stiff with respect to the time direction .",
    "in the generated states @xmath56 , there will occur larger and larger 1d clusters of spins along the time - direction that have the same orientation , @xmath66 .",
    "flipping one of the spins inside such a cluster becomes less and less frequent as the associated energy change increases with the increasing coupling @xmath43 .",
    "this would result in an inefficient monte carlo sampling with high rejection rates for spin - flips .",
    "we avoid this effect by doing 1d cluster updates instead of single - spin updates : in every iteration of the algorithm an initial flippable spin is selected and , in an intermediate phase , a 1d cluster is grown in the imaginary - time direction before suggesting to flip this cluster as a whole .",
    "we further decrease rejection rates by taking account of changes in the number of flippable spins during the cluster construction .",
    "see appendix  [ appx : mc ] for details .",
    "besides computing in this way expectation values of diagonal operators @xmath48 , one can also evaluate expectation values of non - diagonal operators such as certain correlation functions or , for example , the energy expectation value as described in appendix  [ appx : energy ] .",
    "in the next section , section [ sec : results ] , we numerically characterize the phase diagram of the quantum dimer model using several observables : the magnetization of the associated ising model , dimer densities , the ground - state energy , and the energy gap to the first excited state .",
    "let us briefly describe them in the following .",
    "we compute the root mean square ( rms ) magnetization @xmath67 for the quantum ising model with @xmath54 sites as an order parameter to distinguish the star and plaquette phases and to facilitate comparison to earlier work @xcite .",
    "the simulations give access to dimer densities @xmath68 , the average number of dimers on plaquette @xmath8 .",
    "two - dimensional ( contrast ) plots of these densities nicely illustrate the ground - state structure , even when its periodicity has to be understood in a probabilistic way .",
    "we also evaluate the normalized total numbers of @xmath12-plaquettes @xmath69 . specifically , with @xmath12-plaquettes being the plaquettes carrying @xmath12 dimers and @xmath54 being the system size , @xmath70 .",
    "as described in appendix  [ appx : sumrule ] , the plaquette numbers @xmath71 obey the sum rule @xmath72 notice that @xmath73 does not enter in the sum rule , while changes in the number of 3-plaquettes , which enter both the kinetic and potential energy terms , must be compensated by plaquettes with zero dimers or one dimer .",
    "@xmath74 is nevertheless constrained by the fact the total number of plaquettes is of course constant , i.e. , @xmath75 .      as described above and indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples - of - dimer ] , the hexagonal plaquettes can be separated into three sets @xmath76 , each forming a triangular lattice , such that every hexagon in a set shares a bond with three hexagons of the two other sublattices each .",
    "the `` prototype '' states of the star and the plaquette phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : examples - of - dimer ] ) can be characterized qualitatively in terms of dimer densities in the three sublattices . to this purpose",
    ", we can analyze averaged dimer densities on each sublattice and call them @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 etc .",
    "it should be stressed that the systems under study may have degenerate ( or nearly degenerate ) ground states .",
    "the star crystal ( ground state for @xmath79 ) and the ideal plaquette state ( not a ground state , see below ) are both 3-fold degenerate . for sufficiently large systems , it is expected that this symmetry is kinetically broken in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "however , one can not fully prevent the system from translating from one typical ground - state configuration to another ( even at the level of medium - size patches ) , smearing out the information carried by these local parameters .",
    "this possibility was minimized here by choosing large system sizes and low temperatures .",
    "we nevertheless carefully kept track of this possible problem in analyzing the data .",
    "specifically for the sublattice dimer densities , during the course of the monte carlo simulation , we have rearranged the three sublattice labels according to the dimer occupancies , instead of keeping the ordering constant .",
