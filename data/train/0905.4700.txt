    "cross - layer scheduling has been shown to achieve a significant performance gain in wireless systems as a result of multiuser diversity gain .",
    "most of the existing cross - layer designs heavily rely on either perfect csit @xcite @xcite@xcite or imperfect @xcite @xcite/ delayed csit @xcite @xcite .",
    "perfect csit is difficult to obtain in practice , especially in fdd systems in which explicit feedback is required . with imperfect csit , systematic packet errors would result even if powerful error correction codes are applied .",
    "this is because given the imperfect csit , there is uncertainty on the instantaneous mutual information at the base station and the scheduled data rate may exceed the instantaneous mutual information , leading to packet errors ( channel outage ) despite the use of powerful error correction coding .",
    "it has been shown @xcite@xcite that packet errors cause significant degradation in cross - layer performance .",
    "there are some works to take into account of the imperfect csit or limited csit feedback in cross - layer design .",
    "for example , in @xcite @xcite , the authors studied the cross - layer design with noiseless limited feedback . in @xcite @xcite",
    ", the authors studied ofdma cross layer design with outdated csit .",
    "however , in all these works , the csit obtained is either noiseless ( or no delay ) or the statistics of the csit errors is assumed to be known @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , the knowledge of csit errors statistics such as csit error variance and csit delay is needed and this is not easy to obtain because it depends on the mobility of the users as well as the multipath profile .",
    "it is quite challenging to have a robust cross - layer scheduling solution without the knowledge of csit error variance . on the other hand , regardless of the csit , there are always ack / nak flows between the mobiles ( ms ) and the basestations ( bs ) .",
    "a robust cross - layer scheduling should make the best use of the ack / nak information which is embedded in the protocol .",
    "conventional cross - layer design that utilized csit to perform resource allocation is essentially an open - loop system because bs can not determine if the packet is received correctly or not even with the knowledge of csit ( due to decoding errors ) . in practice ,",
    "the system may have heterogeneous mix of mobiles with different capabilities ( e.g. some has turbo decoding capability while some only has simple detection capability ) . to accommodate the heterogeneous mixture of receiver capability in the resource allocation , the bs has to rely on ack / nak flows ( because the ack / nak flows give information about whether a packet can be decoded successfully or not ) .",
    "this closed loop information can not be obtained in csit - based scheduler .      recognizing the importance of utilizing the ack / nak in the resource allocation at the bs , there are existing works that discuss power control using ack / nak feedbacks .",
    "however , most of the works either considered power control on a wireless link only as well as utilizing heuristic algorithms or study the performance by simulation .",
    "for example , a power adaptation design and performance study utilizing ack / nak feedbacks for point - to - point systems have appeared in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "cross - layer scheduling utilizing ack / nak feedbacks was investigated in @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular , power control , rate adaptation and user scheduling for flat fading channels and frequency selective channels were carried out in @xcite and @xcite respectively whereas a rate adaptation scheme based on ack / nak feedbacks was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the authors proposed a 2-level hierarchy stochastic scheduling algorithm based on _ learning automata _ ( la ) for an awgn channel by rate adaptation .",
    "although the algorithm was shown to converge to the true channel state values , the convergence is not proven to maximize the throughput which is of usual practical concern . moreover , in all these works @xcite@xcite@xcite , the algorithm designs are based on heuristic solutions and it is not clear what the best possible performance from the ack / nak information is . furthermore , the suboptimal solutions obtained have high complexity and is not suitable for real - time implementations . moreover , in all these existing designs , there is no mechanism to control the per - user packet error rate per to a given target level . yet , being able to control the per of the wireless sessions per user is very important from the requirements of applications ( e.g. voice and video codec ) .    motivated by all the reasons above , we propose a robust closed - loop cross - layer design for ofdm systems where no explicit csit knowledge is needed at the base station .",
    "the cross - layer power allocation , user assignment as well as rate allocation are adaptive to the built - in 1-bit ack / nak feedbacks @xcite @xcite @xcite from the selected users . being built in at the link layer of most wireless systems and hence , the ack / nak feedbacks add no incremental cost to the proposed closed - loop design . moreover , since the cross - layer solution is driven by the ack / nak feedbacks , it introduces robustness on the cross - layer performance with respect to uncertainty at the csit and propagation parameters .",
    "these robustness can not be obtained by utilizing explicit limited csit feedback .",
    "however , there are several challenges in solving the problem :        conventional cross - layer optimization only consider sum ergodic capacity as the optimization objection .",
    "ergodic capacity only considers the b / s / hz transmitted by the bs regardless of packet errors . as a result ,",
    "ergodic capacity is a reasonable performance metric only when the packet error is negligible ( which is the case with perfect csit and very strong coding ) .",
    "however , in our case without csit , there is always systematic packet errors ( due to channel outage ) and this can not be alleviated by just using strong coding . to accommodate packet errors",
    ", we have to use system goodput ( b / s / hz successfully received by the mobiles ) as our performance metric . note that goodput reduces to ergodic capacity in the case of no errors but in general , to deal with goodput , we need to deal with the cdf of mutual information ( rather than the first order moment only ) and this impose some technique challenges to the problem .",
    "while the problem belongs to mdp , it is well - known that there is usually no simple solution ( even numerically ) using standard value - iteration and policy - iteration solutions ( see details in section [ section : mdp ] ) .",
    "for instance , the mdp belongs to the class of infinite state space and brute - force approach has exponential complexity in the number of time slots @xmath0 and hence , they could not give useful solutions . instead of brute - force solution , we exploit some special structure of the ofdm and obtained a low complexity closed - form solution , which is asymptotically optimal for sufficiently small per target .",
    "as pointed out , all existing solutions are heuristic in nature and studied performance purely by simulations .",
    "this is because of the challenging nature of the problem . in this paper",
    ", we shall derive some asymptotic properties on the system performance so as to obtain some design insights .",
    "we consider the downlink of a wireless system with a base station and @xmath1 mobile users over frequency selective fading channels ( ofdm ) .",
    "the base station shall adapt the downlink rate , power and user selection in an ofdm system based on the ack / nak feedbacks from the mobiles . to take into account of potential packet errors due to channel outage",
    ", we consider an average system goodput which measures the number of bits successfully transmitted as our performance measure .",
    "the robust cross - layer design is modelled as a markov decision process ( mdp ) @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite with power , rate and user selection policies as the optimization variables so as to optimize the average system goodput while maintaining a target per .",
    "it is well - known that mdp - based problems @xcite@xcite always require complex value iteration algorithms .",
    "however , in this paper , we shall derive a simple closed - form solution for the mdp cross - layer problem which is asymptotically optimal for sufficiently small target per .",
    "the proposed solution has low complexity and is suitable for realtime implementation .",
    "it is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems that do not utilize the ack / nak feedbacks for cross - layer designs or cross - layer systems that utilize very unreliable csit for adaptation with mismatch in csit error statistics . furthermore , since the ack / nak feedbacks are generated by the mobiles based on crc checking after packet detection , the proposed closed - loop cross - layer scheme is very flexible in the sense that it can automatically accommodate mobiles with different receive sensitivities in the rf or variations in the baseband estimation and decoding algorithms .",
    "hence , the proposed scheme achieve significant goodput gain with built - in robustness against channel fluctuations as well as variations across the capabilities of different mobile receivers .",
    "mdp has found applications in ecology , economics and communications engineering since 1950 @xcite .",
    "mdp is a modeling tool which describes a sequential decision making process .",
    "it is used to make the _ optimal _ sequence of decisions where outcomes of the problem are partly random and partly depend on such decisions .",
    "the advantage of mdp is that it provides a systematic framework for analysis of optimality , existence , dynamics and convergence of solutions .",
    "a complete description of a mdp problem involves a _ decision epoch _ , a _ state space _ , a _ control policy _ , a _ state transition kernel _ as well as a _ reward function_.",
    "the time line is first divided into decision epochs in which the controller makes decisions on control actions and the system receives _ rewards _ at the decision epochs .",
    "specifically , at the @xmath2-th decision epoch , the system occupies a state @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the state space .",

    "based on the action @xmath9 and the current state @xmath10 , the system receives a reward @xmath11 and moves to the next state @xmath12 according to the _ state transition probability kernel _ @xmath13 .",
    "the optimization problem is to find the optimal control policy so as to maximize the total rewards : @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", a mdp problem can be characterized by the tuple @xmath15 .",
    "one reason why the mdp problem is difficult is due to the huge dimensions of the variable , namely the entire policy space @xmath8 . as a result ,",
    "a key step in solving the mdp is known as _ divide - and - conquer_. specifically , instead of optimizing for the entire problem , it can shown that the mdp can be solved by optimization of actions @xmath9 on a per - stage basis .",
    "there has been a lot of in - depth analysis of mdp @xcite @xcite and different branches of the problem .",

    "_ constrained mdp _ etc . by constrained mdp ,",
    "we mean that the problem has one or more constraints on the feasible policy space @xmath8 .",
    "constrained mdp problems are closely related to communication problems @xcite such as power and rate control problems with an average delay constraint @xcite ; scheduling problems involving routing in ad - hoc networks @xcite or handoff problems @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors optimized the occurrence of path optimizations for inter - switch handoffs in wireless atm networks .",
    "the expected total cost per call , including the switching/ handoff cost and signaling costs , is modeled as a infinite - horizon semi - markov decision process @xcite with discount rate .",
    "this expected total cost is the objective function to be minimized . at each decision epoch",
    ", the decision maker can choose to do path optimization or not which is modeled in the action set .",
    "using divide - and - conquer principle , the mdp problem can be solved using _ value iteration algorithm _ or policy iteration algorithm @xcite .",

    "<S> the proposed solution also has low complexity and is suitable for realtime implementation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems that do not utilize the ack / nak feedbacks for cross - layer designs or cross - layer systems that utilize very unreliable csit for adaptation with mismatch in csit error statistics . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic analysis is also provided to obtain useful design insights .    </S>",
