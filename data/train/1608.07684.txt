    "with the development of quantum technology , quantum metrology is becoming a very remarkable and significant subject , which mainly concerns the estimation of parameters and how to improve the precision by employing the quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "most of works considered to measure the parameters with a perfect measurement set - up @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage factors are noise and lossy probe particles .",
    "few works explore the estimation of parameters with imperfect measurement .",
    "recently , in reference @xcite , florian fr@xmath0wis @xmath1 investigated the quantum fisher information @xcite with finite measurement precision , where quantum fisher information is inversely proportional to the measurement precision of parameters .",
    "coarsened measurement not only includes the coarsened measurement precision but also the coarsened reference @xcite .",
    "a complete measurement can be divided into two steps : first step , set up a measurement reference and control it ; second step , using corresponding projector to make the final measurement(many works deal with the coarsened measurement in this step ) .",
    "so , the authors in reference@xcite only consider the question in the second step .",
    "however , the coarsened reference can have a more negative function than the coarsened measurement precision , especially in quantum - to - classical transition@xcite .",
    "namely , the coarsened measurement reference also plays a main role in quantum metrology .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the role of coarsened measurement reference in quantum metrology and how to reduce the adverse impact .",
    "the coarsened measurement reference comes from the coarsened measurement time and the chosen basis .",
    "for one common reference basis , the disadvantage can be removed by employing an even number of the same probe particles . given a finite uncertainty of coarsened measurement reference basis ,",
    "the optimal number of probe particle is obtained in estimating phase . for the coarsened reference time",
    ", we find that contrary to the result in reference @xcite the maximally entangled state will not achieve better precision under the non - markovian case than the product state when the uncertainty @xmath2 is larger than a certain value . in reference",
    "@xcite , the effect of coarsened measurement precision can be suppressed by a unitary back - squeezing operator before the final measurement .",
    "however , no unitary operator can suppress the disadvantage brought by the general coarsened measurement reference .",
    "so it is more important to control the reference accurately at first .",
    "the rest of this article is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the measurement set - up and model . in section iii , the role of coarsened reference basis in estimating phase is considered . in section iv , the coarsened measurement reference time in measuring the frequency",
    "is discussed . a concise conclusion and an outlook",
    "are included in section v.",
    "we consider the probe system composed of @xmath3 two - level particles .",
    "the hamiltonian of each particle is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes pauli operator with the eigenvector @xmath6 .",
    "generally , we use linear operators to perform the measurement .",
    "the form of projective measurement operator for each particle is described with the reference basis @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "when the measurement reference basis is coarsened , the reference basis @xmath6 becomes fuzzy .",
    "the above projective operator will be changed as follows : @xmath9 where the unitary operator @xmath10 satisfies : @xmath11 @xmath12 denotes the normalized gaussian kernel @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the coarsened degree of reference basis .",
    "the coarsened measurement reference also includes the reference time . when measuring some parameters such as frequency , one must choose a interrogation time .",
    "if the reference time is uncertain , the corresponding interrogation time is fuzzy .",
    "the interrogation time @xmath15 will deviate from the expectation value @xmath16 , with the probability @xmath17}{\\int_{t=0}^\\infty dt\\exp[-\\frac{{(t - t_0)}^2}{2\\delta^2}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the range time should be @xmath18 .",
    "the famous cram@xmath19r - rao bound @xcite offers a very good parameter estimation : @xmath20},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 represents total number of experiments given by the fixed total time @xmath22 , and @xmath15 is the interrogation time .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the fisher information , which is defined by @xmath24}{dx}]^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the probability of obtaining the set of experimental results @xmath26 for the parameter value @xmath27 .",
    "the coarsened measurement reference will decrease the fisher information , leading to reducing the precision of parameter .",
    "we consider to measure the phase of probe system .",
    "the final measurement precision depends on the initial state . in perfect reference basis , the initial maximally entangled states @xmath28 can help to enhance the resolution of phase @xmath29 to the heisenberg limit : @xmath30",
    "however , the product state @xmath31 only arrives at the quantum limit .      in coarsened reference basis , the final precision will be influenced .",
    "when the initial state of probe system is the maximally entangled state , a phase @xmath29 is encoded after some time : @xmath32 .",
    "the optimal linear projector for each particle in coarsened reference basis can be written as @xmath33 where the unitary operator can be chosen as @xmath34 .",
    "we need to note that whether there is a common origin leading to the @xmath3 coarsened reference base .",
    "for example , when we choose the measurement operator to be @xmath35 .",
    "namely , measure the system along the x direction .",
    "we consider the n measurements along the x direction based on the common coordinate system .",
    "when the common coordinate system is coarsened , the n measurement operators will be coarsened synchronously .",
    "in other words , the @xmath3 linear measurement operators in common coordinate system are correlated .",
    "so with synchronously coarsened reference bases , the corresponding projector should be @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ & \\otimes & [ 1/2u^\\dagger(\\theta)(|0\\rangle+(-1)^{\\eta_2}|1\\rangle)(\\langle0|+(-1)^{\\eta_2}\\langle1|)u(\\theta)]\\nonumber\\\\ & ... & [ 1/2u^\\dagger(\\theta)(|0\\rangle+(-1)^{\\eta_n}|1\\rangle)(\\langle0|+(-1)^{\\eta_n}\\langle1|)u(\\theta)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 we can get the probability : @xmath38 substituting the above probabilities into eq.(10 ) , the fisher information is obtained @xmath39 when @xmath40 with odd @xmath26 , the resolution of phase is given by @xmath41 then we can obtain the optimal resolution for @xmath42 , @xmath43    it is easy to obtain the optimal resolution of phase in coarsened reference basis with the initial probe in the product state .",
    "@xmath44 obviously , when the n measurement operators are coarsened synchronously , the entangled state will not perform better than the product state for large n.    in order to reduce the influence of coarsened reference basis , we use a unitary operator to transform the encoded state @xmath32 into @xmath45 . when the number of particles is even , the effect of coarsened measurement reference is completely eliminated .",
    "namely , the heisenberg limit is recovered , @xmath46 for odd particles , the final resolution of phase is @xmath47 . obviously ,",
    "using a unitary transformation before measurement to get an appropriate state can help to improve the measurement precision in the common measurement reference .      generally , the n linear measurement operators are coarsened independently . without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that the coarsened degrees of n coarsened reference bases are same .",
    "so the corresponding measurement projector for n particles are given by @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ \\otimes \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\theta_2 \\lambda_\\delta(\\theta_2)[1/2u^\\dagger(\\theta_2)(|0\\rangle+(-1)^{\\eta_2}|1\\rangle)(\\langle0|+(-1)^{\\eta_2}\\langle1|)u(\\theta_2)]\\nonumber\\\\ ...",
    "\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\theta_n \\lambda_\\delta(\\theta_n)[1/2u^\\dagger(\\theta_n)(|0\\rangle+(-1)^{\\eta_n}|1\\rangle)(\\langle0|+(-1)^{\\eta_n}\\langle1|)u(\\theta_n)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37    for the initial probe particles in the maximal entangled state @xmath32 , we can obtain the probability distribution : @xmath49    using the same way in the above subsection , we can get the optimal resolution of phase @xmath50 comparing with the resolution in eq.(17 ) , the resolution in independent coarsened references is better than in common coarsened reference .",
    "however , the influence of independent coarsened references can not be removed by the way in above subsection .",
    "the maximally entangled state does not perform better than product state all the time for large n. the optimal resolution for entangled state in independent coarsened references is obtained with @xmath51 .",
    "in this section , we consider to measure the frequency @xmath52 of probe system . and",
    "each probe particle is subjected to a system - environment interaction that induces pure dephasing .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is some operator of environment .",
    "the reduced density matrix of each probe particle satisfies @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "when the initial state of probe system is product state @xmath31 , use the ramsey spectroscopy set - up @xcite to measure the frequency in coarsened reference time .",
    "the resulting single particle signal is given by @xmath57}}\\int_{t=0}^{\\infty}dt\\exp[-\\frac{{(t - t_0)}^2}{2\\delta^2}]\\frac{1+\\cos(\\phi t)\\exp(-\\gamma(t))}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the optimal interrogation time without coarsened reference , and @xmath29 denotes the detuning between the frequency of the external oscillator and the probe particle frequency @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "then by calculating the fisher information , the uncertainty of frequency is obtained in coarsened reference time : @xmath58\\langle",
    "t\\rangle}{n t\\langle t\\sin(\\phi t)\\exp(-\\gamma(t))\\rangle^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59f(t)/{\\int_{t=0}^\\infty dt\\exp[-\\frac{{(t - t_0)}^2}{2\\delta^2}]}$ ] . the value of @xmath16 is given by @xmath60 the value of @xmath29 is given by @xmath61 with odd @xmath26 . for reducing the influence of coarsened reference time",
    ", the value of @xmath26 should be 1 .",
    "a similar calculation can be performed for the initial state of probe system in a maximally entangled state @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding resolution of frequency is obtained @xmath62\\langle t\\rangle}{n^2",
    "t\\langle t\\sin(n\\phi t)\\exp(-n\\gamma(t))\\rangle^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the value of optimal interrogation time @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 the corresponding value of @xmath29 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "as a result of what is now known in reference @xcite : with perfect measurement reference time , product and maximally entangled preparations of probe system achieve the same resolution of frequency when subject to markovian dephasing @xmath66 ; when subject to general non - markovian dephasing @xmath67 , the maximally entangled state can perform better than the product state , leading to achieving the resolution beyond the quantum limit . here , non - markovian dephasing generally happens when condensed matter systems are subjected to non - markovian environments with characterized long correlation times and/or structured spectral features @xcite .",
    "the universal time dependence @xmath67 is the fundamental basis of the quantum zeno effect @xcite    from the above equation , we can see that the resolution must decrease due to that coarsened reference time makes the measurement at the optimal interrogation time to be impossible .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the maximally entangled state will not achieve better precision under the non - markovian case than the product state when the uncertainty @xmath2 is larger than a certain value .",
    "namely , the product state is more resistant to interference of coarsened reference time than entangled state . and the maximally entangled state always achieves better precision under the case of non - markovian dephasing than that under the case of markovian dephasing .",
    "this diagram shows that the precision of frequency @xmath68 changes with the uncertainty of reference time @xmath2 . here , the line 1 represents the precision under the case of markovian dephasing with the initial product state",
    ". the line 2 denotes the case of non - markovian dephasing with the maximally entangled state .",
    "the line 3 represents @xmath69 times the precision under the case of markovian dephasing with the maximally entangled state .",
    "the parameters are given by : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 . ]",
    "in this article , we investigate the role of coarsened measurement reference basis and time in quantum metrology .",
    "when subject to the synchronously coarsened reference bases , a unitary transformation before measurement can help to eliminate the disadvantage . in the independent coarsened basis reference , the maximally entangled state can not overcome the standard quantum limit .",
    "and it does not perform better than product state all the time for large n. in the coarsened time reference , the product state is more resistant to interference of coarsened reference time than the entangled state .",
    "the maximally entangled state always achieves better precision under the case of non - markovian dephasing than that under the case of markovian dephasing .",
    "the coarsened reference can exert a more important influence in quantum metrology than the coarsened measurement precision .",
    "it is needful to reduce the harmful factor from the coarsened reference , which is very important in experiment .",
