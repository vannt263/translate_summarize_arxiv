    "<S> wavefront shaping has revolutionized imaging deep in scattering media  @xcite , being able to spatially  @xcite and temporally  @xcite refocus light through or inside the medium . however , wavefront shaping is not compatible yet with polarization - resolved microscopy given the need of polarizing optics to refocus light with a controlled polarization state . here , we show that wavefront shaping is not only able to restore a focus , but it can also recover the injected polarization state without using any polarizing optics at the detection . this counter - intuitive effect occurs up to several transport mean free path thick samples , which exhibit a speckle with a completely scrambled state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , an arbitrary rotation of the input polarization does not degrade the quality of the focus . this unsupervised re - polarization  out of the originally scrambled polarization state  paves the way for polarization - resolved structural microscopy  @xcite at unprecedented depths . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this phenomenon and demonstrate second harmonic generation ( shg ) structural imaging of collagen fibers in tendon tissues behind a scattering medium . </S>",
    "<S> +    accessing the structural organization of molecular assemblies is an important aspect of biological imaging . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this organization determines important functions such as the formation of bio - filaments , but also contributes to disorders such as in the formation of amyloids in neurodegenerative diseases . </S>",
    "<S> polarization - resolved microscopies are able to provide molecular structural insights beyond the diffraction - limited scale  @xcite , and , being non - invasive and non - destructive , could in principle be used for deep _ in - vivo _ structural imaging . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , light propagation through multiply scattering media , like thick biological tissues , inherently scrambles polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> after injection of a well - defined polarization state and wavevector direction , each successive scattering event rotates the polarization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , after multiple scattering events the polarization is ultimately scrambled and the wavefront concomitantly distorted generating a speckle ( schematically sketched in fig . [ fig1].a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this unavoidable scrambling makes molecular structural imaging impossible deep in biological media . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , it is highly detrimental for polarization - resolved studies because no predetermined relation with the incoming polarization state exists anymore : this is indeed a prerequisite for the analysis of the polarized response and its relation to structural modeling  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> wavefront shaping has been introduced to overcome penetration depths limits in scattering media  @xcite . by coherently controlling the speckle pattern generated from multiple scattering events , </S>",
    "<S> one can increase the energy density at targeted positions building a constructive interference locally . </S>",
    "<S> wavefront shaping allows refocusing light through  @xcite , or inside  @xcite , scattering media thanks to the manipulation of the wavefront phase or amplitude  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the analysis of polarization effects on wavefront shaping experiments has been often disregarded because , in principle , there are no correlations among the @xmath0 elements of the vectorial transmission matrix @xmath1  @xcite , relating input field @xmath2 with polarization state @xmath3 to output field @xmath4 with polarization state @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to control the output polarization state , one needs to perform polarization sensitive measurements of the transmission matrix  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate an effect which enables polarization - resolved imaging through scattering media , and forms the basis for prospective deep structural molecular imaging : polarization revival out of a polarization - state - scrambled speckle ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1].b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss aspects related to the speckle without wavefront shaping . </S>",
    "<S> we performed experiments at controlled optical thickness ( @xmath6 ) using phantoms with scattering properties similar to biological media ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> to aid the discussion , the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].a shows simplified schematics of the polarization state combinations used . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].a ( red dashed ) shows the spatially output - averaged degree of linear polarization ( dolp=@xmath7 , where i is intensity ) of the speckle observed outside the medium . as @xmath6 increases , the speckle polarization state decreases its correlation with the initial linearly polarized one as evidenced by the decrease in @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when performing wavefront shaping the outcome is very different . to find the optimal wavefronts , a _ </S>",
    "<S> broadband _ transmission matrix is first acquired  @xcite ( see methods ) _ without any selection of output polarization state _ using the experimental layout shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4].a ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].a inset , continuous line ) . in practice , this is equivalent to acquire experimental transmission matrix elements @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> once the transmission matrix is known , we can selectively refocus light at targeted positions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].a , upper right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , upon rotation of the input polarization state the refocus does not degrade . </S>",
    "<S> we further quantified this resilience to a change in input state as intensity ratio between the two injected polarization states ( @xmath10 ) shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].a ( continuous line ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , only minute degradation of the refocus intensity ratio is seen reaching depths in the diffusive regime ( @xmath11 ) , in striking contrast with the dolp measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect was observed through an opaque 1  mm - thick brain slice , where the dependence of the focus intensity with respect to the incident polarization is almost constant ( fig [ fig2].b , top left panel ) .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the optimally shaped wavefront is able to refocus light with a well - defined polarization state , even though no output polarization state is privileged . </S>",
    "<S> the refocus is indeed highly polarized and correlated with the input one , as evidenced by the complete extinction of its intensity upon placement of an analyzer , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2].b ( bottom left panel , see supplementary section 1 for polarization state evaluation of the refocus ) .    the results above indirectly reveal correlations of the polarization - related part of the vectorial transmission matrix elements because they imply @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are formally shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] as cross - correlation of another set of measurements where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independently measured for the same realization of disorder ( with the polarization state combination used shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] left panels ) . in this analysis , </S>",
    "<S> which procedure is explained in supplementary section 2 , the peak above the noise confirms that the diagonal elements of the vectorial transmission matrix are highly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from these observations that @xmath15 , since the speckle from @xmath16 has a smaller contrast and is moreover weakly correlated with @xmath13 ( see supplementary section 2 for correlation among elements ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further explored the reason for these effects and found out that the transmission matrix correlations and polarization state revival are related to the broadband nature of the acquired transmission matrix . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these effects are considerably decreased when the transmission matrix is taken with a monochromatic source , as expected  @xcite  ( see supplementary section 3 for similar experiments performed with monochromatic light ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we then exploited these correlations for demonstrating nonlinear structural imaging . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the experimental layout and representative results of a wavefront shaping experiment . in a first step , </S>",
    "<S> a polarization combination is used where analyzer and incoming polarization state are aligned together , that is , a configuration measuring the @xmath13 elements . note that the presence of the analyzer is not necessary for a wavefront shaping experiment , but it supports an unambiguous proof of structural imaging ( see below ) . after acquiring the broadband transmission matrix ( see methods ) , we spatially refocus light in a raster scanning fashion and acquire in parallel the enhanced shg signal from nanocrystals of potassium titanyl phosphate ( nanoktp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar character of nanoktp ensures that no ambiguity exists in the polarization state evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> the refocused light generates efficient shg from the nanoscopic sources as seen by the two nanoparticles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4].b ( left panel ) . in a second step , a second imaging scan using the very same optimal wavefronts is taken ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4].b , right panel ) , however with the incoming polarization state rotated 90@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the refocus after the scattering medium still persists and highlights the second particle revealing the orientation - dependent nonlinear efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the presence of nanoktp crystals with different orientations , which are identified using the same wavefront . </S>",
    "<S> any oriented nonlinear source could be probed in the same way , highlighting its molecular order organization in a scattering medium . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation is found , for example , in coherent raman imaging of biological membranes  @xcite or myelin sheath in neurons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the implication of these observations for structural nonlinear imaging in biologically relevant specimens are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . in order to mimic a nonlinear microscopy experiment , we showcase shg imaging of collagen fibers placed after the scattering medium with a characterized transmission matrix . </S>",
    "<S> different from the previous experiment , here we exploit the memory effect to raster scan the refocus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this methodology is able to provide highly contrasted shg images of rat tendon specimens where clear fibers can be seen running along the diagonal of the images ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , left panel ) . in this demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we do not use an analyzer to detect the shg : in an eventual refocusing inside a scattering medium the nonlinearly generated photons polarization state would be scrambled  @xcite . therefore , structural imaging is only insightful if performed in a non - analyzed configuration . by fixing the refocus position in a fiber and rotating the excitation polarization state , we can still perform a polarization - resolved study  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ( right panel ) shows the measured shg intensity ( green circles ) and a fit ( black continuous line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved nonlinear optical constants of collagen are in excellent agreement with previously reported values  @xcite ( see supplementary section 4 for further information on the shg analysis ) .    finally , we expect these correlations to have profound implications for deep structural imaging in various approaches . for instance , acoustic - based methods  @xcite are able to refocus in the diffuse regime ( @xmath18 ) with cellular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the acoustic signal from the obtained refocus could be able to perform structural analysis : if the absorbers are organized in an ordered way , a rotation of the refocus optical polarization , using the very same wavefront , should lead to a change in the acoustic signal . </S>"
