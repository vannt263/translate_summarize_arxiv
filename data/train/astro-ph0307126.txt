    "classical novae are a manifestation of thermonuclear runaways in accreted hydrogen shells on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in close binary systems ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "compelling observational data indicate that the material ejected by some classical novae can be significantly enriched in c , n , o , and ne , by @xmath2 by mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the abundance of cno catalysts constrains the rate of energy release , such high levels of cno enrichment are required in the fastest novae @xcite , for which the hydrogen burning reactions ( via the cno cycle ) increase the entropy of the envelope faster than it can adjust .",
    "it was recognized early that if some of the underlying white dwarf matter could be mixed into the accreted envelope prior to the final stages of the thermonuclear runaway , then the explosion would be more energetic and the ejecta more enriched in cnone elements @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional models that best reproduce observations typically accrete material `` seeded '' with a super - solar composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the question of how the accreted envelope is enriched has challenged theory for several decades ( see , e.g. the review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for very slow accretion ( @xmath3 ) , the downward diffusion of h into the underlying c / o or o / ne layers @xcite could trigger ignition in the h diffusive tail and drive convective mixing of heavy elements into the envelope during the early stages of runaway .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether there is time at higher accretion rates for this process to be relevant .",
    "the possibility of mixing via convective overshoot was first considered by @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of convective penetration and mixing at the core - envelope interface have been carried out in both two dimensions @xcite and three @xcite . from comparisons of two- and three - dimensional simulations and a careful resolution study ,",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite , @xcite ) concluded that convective penetration would not significantly enrich the accreted envelope .",
    "the general problem of shear mixing was considered by many @xcite , but to date no self - consistent calculations of these effects have been performed .",
    "@xcite considered shearing from differential rotation in the envelope and estimated the amount of mass mixed by assuming that the envelope was marginally stable according to the richardson criterion .",
    "@xcite considered non - axisymmetric perturbations and the resulting redistribution of matter and angular momentum .",
    "@xcite emphasized the role of barotropic and baroclinic instabilities in transporting angular momentum through the envelope .",
    "a variation on this was envisaged by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that convection just prior to the runaway would transport angular momentum inward and lead to a large horizontal shear above the c / o white dwarf .    while these studies examined the generation of shear in the envelope , the details of how c / o is mixed into the envelope and the quantity of mass mixed , as functions of the shear profile , were not resolved . in this paper",
    ", we examine a promising mechanism for effecting the entrainment : a resonant interaction between large - scale shear flows in the accreted envelope and interfacial gravity waves @xcite . the greater compositional buoyancy in",
    "the c / o white dwarf means that the interface sustains gravity waves .",
    "@xcite showed that in the presence of a shear flow ( i.e. , a `` wind '' ) , gravity waves with a group velocity matching a velocity in the shear flow are resonantly amplified .",
    "these waves eventually form cusps and break .",
    "when the waves break , they inject , analogously to ocean waves , a spray of c / o into the h / he atmosphere .",
    "the source of the shear could arise from a number of mechanisms , such as those described above .",
    "a self - consistent calculation of the accretion boundary layer and the wind profile in the atmosphere is far beyond the scope of current simulations . indeed , as we explain in   [",
    "sec : gravitational_waves ] , the resolution needed to simulate the interaction is so fine as to prohibit the direct simulation of this effect within a macroscopically large ( i.e. , the entire atmosphere of the white dwarf ) computational domain .",
    "what this paper provides is a scaling relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mco ] ] ) for the mixing rate per unit area , for a given wind velocity .",
    "this relation may be used to construct a sub - grid model for large - scale multi - dimensional simulations , which can in turn address how matter and angular momentum are transported over the surface .    in ",
    "[ sec : gravitational_waves ] we present the two - dimensional models and demonstrate how the mixed mass depends on the velocity of the flow .",
    "we then , in   [ sec : nova1d ] , incorporate this relation into a one - dimensional simulation and discuss two scenarios : that mixing only occurs if the convective zone reaches the c / o interface ; and that the mixing occurs prior to the onset of convection .",
    "we implement these results as a sub - grid model in one - dimensional novae simulations performed with a stellar evolution code and discuss the implications , in   [ sec : implications ] , for the ejected mass of c / o . because the shear in the envelope prior to the onset of convection is unknown ,",
    "we compute the accretion and runaway for several different masses of the mixed layers .",
    "to calculate the amount of mass mixed by wave breaking as a function of time , we performed a suite of numerical simulations of wind - driven gravity waves .",
    "the initial configuration consists of two stably stratified layers of compressible fluids in hydrostatic equilibrium in a uniform gravitational field @xmath4 . the upper fluid is composed of h / he and the lower fluid is composed of c / o .",
    "the equation of state is an ideal gamma - law of internal energy @xmath5 .",
    "we choose @xmath6 and for the initial condition we construct an isentropic envelope in hydrostatic equilibrium . the density is then given by @xmath7^{1/(\\gamma-1)}$ ] , where @xmath8 is the density of the upper fluid just above the interface , @xmath9 is the density of the lower fluid just below the interface , @xmath10 is the pressure scale height , and @xmath11  is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "this choice makes the brunt - visl frequency zero , i.e. , there are no internal gravity waves within each of the two layers , which isolates the interface modes for study .",
    "we impose a wind in the upper fluid with velocity @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vertical direction and @xmath14 corresponds to the location of the initial interface ; @xmath15  is the asymptotic maximum velocity at @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the length scale of the shear boundary layer .",
    "the form of the wind profile ( eq .  [ [ eq : profile ] ] ) is chosen to model the boundary layer formed at the surface of the white dwarf , and is motivated by studies of the wind - wave resonant instability in oceanography @xcite .",
    "this instability is the principal mechanism that drives gravity waves and air - water mixing in oceans . in the limit @xmath18 ,",
    "one recovers the kelvin - helmholtz wind profile . without a study of angular momentum transport in the accreting envelope",
    ", we do not know the form of the wind profile and in this work investigate the mixing for a range of @xmath17 , with @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite performed a linear stability analysis of the wave amplification for the novae problem , and in a forthcoming paper ( alexakis et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will present extensive numerical studies of wave - wind interactions . here",
    "we apply those results to the conditions at the base of the white dwarf envelope .",
    "the simulations are performed using the flash  code @xcite , a parallel , multi - dimensional , adaptive - mesh code for simulating compressible , inviscid flow .",
    "the computational grid was a uniform mesh of resolution @xmath20 with periodic boundary conditions along the sides of the box and hydrostatic boundaries @xcite at the top and bottom .",
    "the interface is perturbed with specified modes and a velocity perturbation added to the surface of the wd representing the motion of the gravity waves .",
    "the wind profile is specified as an initial condition and in particular is not forced . for this study",
    ", we set the mach number @xmath21 and consider four values of @xmath22 : 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.04 .",
    "these values vary the reciprocal froude number @xmath23 , which measures the available kinetic energy for mixing .",
    "the unstable modes have wavenumbers @xcite @xmath24 .",
    "we chose the size of our computational domain to be roughly equal to this maximum wavelength , so that we have 1024 grid points along the largest possible wave . in practice ,",
    "smaller waves become dominant , with the wavelength of the dominant mode depending on the wind profile . in all cases",
    "this dominant mode is well - resolved .",
    "figure  [ fig : break_layer ] shows fully developed waves breaking , generation of the  spray \" , and mixing of the white dwarf substrate up into the atmosphere .",
    "mixing is not only effected by the overturning of the wave but also by the wind breaking off the tip of the wave .",
    "figure  [ fig : c12_contours ] shows contours ( _ black lines _ ) of the carbon mass fraction at 0.49 , 0.20 , and 0.02 , respectively , for the simulation depicted in figure  [ fig : break_layer ] , but at a later time .",
    "the contour at 0.49 corresponds to the carbon mass fraction of the underlying white dwarf , while the smaller contour values indicate how far outward into the accreted material the white dwarf substrate is mixed .",

    "the amount of mixed mass depends on these delimiters ; reducing the upper limit to 0.4 decreases the mixed mass by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "the c / o is mixed rapidly until it saturates ; further mixing occurs on diffusive timescales .",
    "our two - dimensional simulations show , for the range of parameters examined , that the total mass of white dwarf material that becomes mixed is independent of the lengthscale @xmath17 .",
    "the rate of mixing , i.e. , the initial slopes of the curves in figure  [ fig : mixc12 ] , does show , however , some dependence on @xmath17 . using dimensional analysis and the numerical results , we find that for a fixed density ratio @xmath33 ( appropriate for the degenerate plasma prior to ignition ) the total mass per unit area , @xmath32 , mixed into the accreted h / he saturates at @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a non - dimensional constant depends on @xmath36 and possibly @xmath37 .",

    "the timescale to reach saturation is far shorter than the timescale of either the accretion phase ( @xmath39 ) or the pre - peak convective phase ( @xmath40 ) of a typical classical nova .",
    "for example , if @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then the saturation timescale is of order seconds for our nova setup .     and",

    "we do not find any contact of the convective region with the wd substrate ; as a result , we do not expect that any convection - driven wave mixing would occur , unless there is a large redistribution of angular momentum in the accreted envelope @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the second scenario ,",
    "the shearing originates from a wind at the base of the accreted envelope blowing across the underlying c / o substrate .",
    "we assume that the wind persists throughout the h / he layer with velocity sufficient to drive mixing on a timescale much less than that to accrete a critical mass of fuel . in this case",
    "the mixed layer is generated prior to ignition .",
    "we also assume a linear ( in lagrangian mass coordinate ) gradient in the mass fraction of c / o between the wd and the accreted envelope . because the shear profile , and hence the amount of mass mixed , is unknown ,",
    "we consider a range of mixed masses ( see table  [ 1dtab ] ) .",
    "our ignorance of the fluid motions in the envelope and substrate prevents us from saying where and how the accreted material spreads over the surface , and so we can not determine the actual shear at the base of the envelope .",
    "in all cases that we consider , the shear velocity is subsonic , which is the range of validity of the 2-d simulations . for such velocities ,",
    "the mixed layer is always thinner than a pressure scale height ( eq .  [ [ eq : mco ] ] ) .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : rich ] shows the case with the largest pre - enrichment : the mixed material comprises @xmath94 ( i.e. , a total of @xmath95 of wd material is being mixed with h - rich material ) .",
    "this is about 25% of the envelope mass , which is less than that generated by the calculation described in section  [ sec : gravitational_waves ] . from equation  ( [ eq : mco ] )",
    ", a 25% enrichment corresponds to @xmath96 if the velocity were uniform over the surface .",
    "we note that this velocity is much less than keplerian , @xmath97 , as expected in the envelope well below the accretion disk boundary layer ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the velocity were not uniform over the surface , then a higher maximum velocity would be required to inject the same percentage of the total envelope mass .",
    "+   but for a model in which the inner @xmath98 are enriched in c / o with a linear composition gradient ( with respect to the lagrangian mass coordinate ) between the wd composition ( c / o ) at the base and the accretion composition ( solar ) at the upper edge .",
    "note that the convective zone does not reach the interface with the wd substrate , and that a significant semi - convective region , indicated by _ red hatching _ , develops prior to the onset of convection .",
    "[ fig : rich ] ] + the mixed layers are added to the surface using the same accretion rate as the rest of the envelope ( @xmath52 ) ; to prevent a runaway while these layers are being added , we suspend nuclear energy generation during the accretion of the first @xmath99 .",
    "about 50@xmath27@xmath100  prior to peak energy generation a semiconvective region forms in the outer 60% ( by mass ) of the enriched layer ; about 8 months before the peak a convection zone starts at the base of this semiconvective layer ( at @xmath101 above the wd interface ) that extends upward to the surface and downward to about @xmath102 above the interface .",
    "in contrast to the first case , the pre - mixed envelope with the largest enriched mass ignites at a smaller accumulated mass , @xmath103 .",
    "+ the energy generation in the enriched layer is dominated by @xmath104 .",
    "the peak energy generation timescale is about @xmath10520 times faster than in the first case  with a specific energy generation rate about 20 times higher .",
    "figure  [ fig : enuc ] shows the specific nuclear energy generation in the accreted envelope , with the time centered about the peak energy generation rate . the larger rate of energy generation roughly corresponds to the @xmath106 times greater metal enrichment . in this scenario the entire 25% of pre - enriched c / o material",
    "is spread throughout the hydrogen envelope during the runaway .",
    "this leads to a a corresponding enrichment in the ejecta .",

    "[ fig : rich ] ) ; the black curve indicates the model without prior enrichemnt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plain ] ) .",
    "the slope of a curve is proportional to the average specific energy generation rate in the envelope .",
    "[ fig : enuc ] ] + as in the first case , the convection never reaches the wd interface ( although the base of the convective zone is much deeper ) , so there is no additional convection - induced wave mixing of the c / o substrate with the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "we did experiment with pre - runaway , pre - enriched layers as small as 1/10,000 the mass used in the case described above ( table  [ 1dtab ] ) .",
    "as before , we disregarded nuclear burning for the first @xmath107 of accreted material , with the exception of the case with @xmath108 of enrichment , where we took twice that mass to accommodate the entire enriched layer .",
    "the difference in masses for which nuclear burning is suspended is the reason for the case with the largest pre - enriched mass , @xmath109 having a slightly larger envelope mass at runaway than that of the case with @xmath108 of enriched mass . + in none of these cases did the convection reach the wd interface .",
    "eventually , for the case of an enriched mass of @xmath110 , the runaway behaves as in the non - enriched case : the energy release rate in the mixed layers is too small to drive convection above and heat conduction cools it efficiently so that the runaway does not occur in its vicinity .",
    "the slightly higher envelope masses obtained in the limit of small enrichment is likely to be an artifact of our suspension of nuclear energy generation for the first fraction of the accretion phase .",
    "3 .   in a third scenario",
    "we assume accretion of material enriched to a mass fraction of 50% in c / o .",
    "allowing for nuclear energy generation instantaneously in this material leads to a rapid runaway after only a thin layer has been accumulated at the surface of the star .",
    "if this magnitude of enrichment was due to instantaneous mixing with a colder wd substrate , then a lower temperature in the enriched material and thus a significantly later runaway could result .",
    "we include this run to demonstrate how qualitatively different the accretion of pre - enriched material behaves as compared to first accreting unenriched material and then , only later after it has settled , mixing the accreted layers with the c / o substrate .",
    "using a constant wind profile that blows across the surface of a white dwarf , we have performed a two - dimensional parameter study of the mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "our primary results of the mixing rate and the maximum mixed mass , equation  ( [ eq : mco ] ) , suggest that this process can mix about @xmath111@xmath112 of the underlying c / o into the hydrogen - rich envelope . from this , we investigated two scenarios : that the wind is the result of convection , and that the wind originates during the accretion phase .",
    "we find that if no enrichment occurs prior to the onset of convection , then the convective zone does not reach the c / o interface , and no additional mixing occurs ( in the one - dimensional model ) in the absence of convective overshoot .",
    "the result in this case will be a slow nova , with little enrichment of the ejecta .",
    "in contrast , an envelope with a mixed layer at the c / o interface , consistent with the scalings from high - resolution numerical studies , provides a more violent runaway and the ejecta are enriched by @xmath113 in c / o , consistent the enrichment observed in some nova ejecta .",
    "such an event does require a strong shear velocity , but the saturation amount of mass mixed is roughly independent of the shape of the shear profile , so long as its thickness is much less than a pressure scale height .",
    "our runs , outlined in table  [ 1dtab ] , show that when the metals are concentrated at the base of the accreted envelope , the amount of mass accreted prior to runaway is _ larger _ than if the c / o were uniformly distributed over the envelope , i.e. , if the white dwarf were to accrete material with a supersolar metallicity .",
    "the reason is that the opacity of the envelope is larger than when the c / o are concentrated at the base .",
    "there are a number of issues that we have not yet addressed or investigated .",
    "first , our results might depend on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "we would therefore expect that although the generation of the gravity waves is captured by two - dimensional dynamics , the energy cascade of the waves and the advection of spray and vorticity will be different in a three dimensions .",
    "second , this work investigates only the density ratio for an accreted envelope in thermal equilibrium . during the early phase of accretion and during the runaway the density ratio will likely be different .",
    "third , although our parameter study covers more than one order of magnitude in @xmath17 , it is important to know if our results still hold at even larger values . as @xmath17 becomes a respectable fraction of @xmath25",
    ", we expect that the stratification of the envelope , and in particular the effect of a non - zero brunt - visl frequency , will become important .",
    "all of these differences can affect the mass and thickness of the mixed layer , and the investigation of these issues is the subject of ongoing work .    in our one - dimensional nova simulations",
    ", we assumed that a convective roll will only entrain the mixed layer if the base of the convective zone ( as computed from a mixing - length formalism ) reaches the interface .",
    "future multidimensional studies can inform us as to how convection interacts with the interfacial gravity waves , and to whether this assumption is in fact correct .",
    "moreover , our sub - grid model , when incorporated into a one - dimensional calculation , does not account for spatial variations of the wind .",
    "such a variation would occur , for example , if the fuel accretes non - uniformly over the surface of the star and then spreads .",
    "in reality the amount of mass mixed will vary over the surface of the star .",
    "our one - dimensional calculations must of necessity take the mixed mass as a free parameter . because the amount of c / o entrained depends quadratically on the velocity in the wind profile ,",
    "our calculation underscores the need for detailed simulations of the shear profile of an accreting white dwarf .",
