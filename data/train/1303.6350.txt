    "the cavities of a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing @xmath13te@xmath17 octahedra are occupied by interconnected tl@xmath18 tetrahedra [ fig .",
    "[ figstruct](a ) ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figsnti](a ) we show arpes data on [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 .",
    "the most prominent feature is an intense , linearly dispersing , dirac - like band centered at a momentum of ( k@xmath8 = 0,k@xmath22 = 0 ) of the two - dimensional surface brillouin zone ( 2dbz ) .",
    "we observe this feature at the center of numerous brillouin zones , and only a single such metallic feature in each zone .",
    "we assign this dirac - like band to be a surface state based on a number of different reasons .",
    "first , the values of the extracted fermi velocity [ 4.6(2 ) ev  ] and the fermi wavevector [ 0.04(1 ) @xmath23 are insensitive to incident photon energy indicating that they are non - dispersive in k@xmath24 [ fig .",
    "[ figsnti](c ) ] , even though the bulk electronic structure is highly three - dimensional .",
    "this is a hallmark of a surface state .",
    "furthermore , this feature is present and always centered at ( 0,0 ) of the 2dbz , and not the center of the three - dimensional bulk brillouin zone , as would be expected from a bulk - derived state .",
    "additionally , we also observe features near the fermi energy ( @xmath25 ) that do vary considerably with the incident photon energy , and which we ascribe to bulk states , consistent with dft calculations ( see below ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figtlti ] , we show arpes data from tl@xmath26te@xmath21 .",
    "much like in [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 , a single , dirac - like surface state is once again visible at ( 0,0 ) while no other dirac - like features are observed anywhere else in the 2dbz . as tl@xmath26te@xmath21 is metallic , containing fewer electrons than [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21",
    ", only the bottom section of the dirac cone is visible , and the extrapolated dirac point sits 200 mev above e@xmath27 .",
    "the fermi velocities [ 3.0(2 ) ev  ] and fermi wavevectors [ 0.07(1 ) @xmath23 observed for the dirac - like band in tl@xmath26te@xmath21 are largely independent of photon energy ( @xmath28 = 21.2 and 40.8 ev ) .",
    "the similarities between surface states observed both in [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 and tl@xmath26te@xmath21 and the single dirac cone observed per brillouin zone suggest that [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 host topologically protected surface states .",
    "further indirect evidence for their topological nature is that we find no rashba - type spin splitting of the surface state despite the strong spin - orbit coupling of these materials , suggesting that we have just a single spin non - degenerate fermi surface between neighboring time - reversal invariant points , the hallmark of a ti .",
    "however , there are several ways in which the [ tl@xmath0@xmath13te@xmath1 structure can result in topological dirac - like surface states .",
    "first , the mirror planes which topologically protect the dirac states in rock salt tcis are also present in the basic perovskite structure",
    ". the appropriate band inversions at points protected by mirror symmetry similarly may yield a tci state in body - centered tetragonal symmetry .",
    "second , the body - centered tetragonal crystal class has four sets of time - reversal invariant points : one @xmath29 , four @xmath30 , two @xmath31 , and one @xmath5 . if spin - orbit coupling produces band parity inversions at the @xmath29 and @xmath5 points , but not @xmath30 or @xmath31 , surface states protected as in a weak topological insulator result .",
    "alternately , a band inversion due to spin - orbit coupling at the @xmath29 or @xmath5 point , but not both , produces strong z@xmath6 topologically protected surface states .",
    "calculations for tl@xmath2te@xmath1 , shown in fig",
    ".  [ figdfttl ] , show spin - orbit coupling induces a single band inversion approximately 0.5 ev above the fermi level between valence and conduction band states at the @xmath5 point .",
    "this inversion is between opposite - parity states , the conduction band involving states from the [ tl@xmath0 units on the @xmath32 site and the valence band involving mainly states from apical te atoms and @xmath33 site tl ions in the corner - sharing perovskite network . if electron - doped to the gap at @xmath5 opened by spin - orbit coupling",
    ", this system would be a topological semi - metal due to high - lying valence band states at the @xmath29 point .",
    "the resulting situation is thus similar to that found in pure antimony @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the z@xmath6 invariant to be -1 by taking product of the parity of all the bands at the @xmath29 and @xmath5 points that connect to the occupied valence bands , including two bands above the fermi level at the @xmath29 point .",
    "therefore , dft predicts tl@xmath2te@xmath1 to have surface states protected by a non - trivial z@xmath6 topology .",
    "in contrast , our calculations shown in fig .  [ figdftsn ] demonstrate that [ tl@xmath0snte@xmath1 , the opposite end member of the [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 solid solution , has trivial z@xmath6 topology : although a possible band inversion occurs near the @xmath29 point , the involved states are of the same parity .",
    "further , an approximately 0.7 ev band gap opens up at the @xmath5 point where the band crossing is observed in tl@xmath2te@xmath1 , preventing spin - orbit coupling from inverting band parity at that point .",
    "these calculations imply that a transition from z@xmath6 non - trivial ( at @xmath34 = 0 , or tl@xmath2te@xmath1 ) to trivial ( at @xmath34 = 1 , or [ tl@xmath0snte@xmath1 ) topology must exist at some doping level @xmath34 in [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the situation in the [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 peroskites is thus similar to what is found for the bi@xmath7sb@xmath8 solid solution @xcite .    to understand the driving force behind the topological transition , we investigated the origins of the large gap opening at the @xmath5 point when sn is substituted for tl .",
    "there are two major structural changes when this doping is performed : a sizable change in lattice parameters , particularly the increase in the @xmath35 axis relative to @xmath36 , and cation mixing . in order to isolate the effect of lattice parameters , the band structure of tl@xmath2te@xmath1",
    "was calculated with the same lattice constants as [ tl@xmath0snte@xmath1 imposed , and it was found that tl@xmath2te@xmath1 would then be topologically trivial , albeit with a smaller bandgap at the @xmath5 point . further emphasizing the importance of the lattice parameters on the topological transition is the fact that the width of the valence band involved in the band inversion that has large apical te weight depends sensitively on the lattice constant @xmath35 of the material due to slight @xmath33 site tl contribution .",
    "this therefore demonstrates the importance of lattice parameters in determining the z@xmath6 topological invariant in the [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 compounds .",
    "preliminary calculations ( not shown ) suggest that the effect of cation ordering is also significant , but detailed studies beyond the scope of this work are needed to elucidate those details and to determine the critical value of @xmath34 required for the transition to a different topological phase in [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath7sn@xmath8)te@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the sensitivity to structural parameters , particularly the @xmath37 ratio , suggest that temperature- and/or strain - driven topological transitions may be possible in this material family .",
    "regardless of these details , dft results are consistent with the arpes detection of a dirac cone in both the tl@xmath2te@xmath1 and [ tl@xmath0(tl@xmath3sn@xmath4)te@xmath1 compounds and indicate that z@xmath6 topology protects surface states in this materials family .",
    "the observation of dirac - like surface states in tl@xmath2te@xmath1 , likely z@xmath6 topologically protected , makes it a candidate topological superconductor .",
    "superconductivity was not observed in [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 above @xmath38 = 1.8 k. because tl@xmath2te@xmath1 was previously proposed to be a two - band superconductor @xcite , we performed a comprehensive specific heat and magnetization study of the superconducting properties .",
    "our specific heat data collected on a polycrystalline chunk under zero magnetic field reveal a clear @xmath39-anomaly .",
    "an equal - entropy construction , shown in fig .",
    "[ figsc](a ) , indicates bulk superconductivity with a @xmath40 = 2.40(1 ) k. the ratio @xmath41/(@xmath42 ) = 1.63 is close to , but slightly greater , than the weak coupling bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) value of 1.43 @xcite . the normal state heat capacity , measured under @xmath43 = 5 koe , is well described by @xmath44 = @xmath45 + @xmath46@xmath38@xmath47 + @xmath48@xmath38@xmath49 , where the term linear in @xmath38 represents the electronic contribution and the higher order terms represent the lattice contribution @xcite .",
    "the fit yields an electronic sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath50 = 10.6(1 ) mj mol f.u.@xmath51 k@xmath52 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the lattice contribution are 3.90(5 ) mj mol f.u.@xmath51 k@xmath55 and 0.740(6 ) mj mol f.u.@xmath51 k@xmath56 , respectively , and the @xmath53 corresponds to a debye temperature of @xmath57 = 159(2 ) k @xcite .",
    "low - temperature specific heat measurements collected under @xmath43 = 0 oe and 5 koe show the latter field is sufficient to quench superconductivity .",
    "the data collected under a @xmath43 = 5 koe field below @xmath38 = 1.5 k , temperatures at which any complex phonon structure should be negligible , were fit to @xmath58 = @xmath50@xmath38 + @xmath46@xmath59 , where @xmath50 = 9.34(4 ) mj mol f.u.@xmath51 k@xmath52 and @xmath46 = 6.82(5 ) mj mol f.u.@xmath51 k@xmath55 @xcite . subtracting this low - temperature lattice specific heat fit gives the electronic specific heat , which is well described by the bcs model of the electronic specific heat of a single - gap @xmath60-wave superconductor @xmath58/(@xmath50@xmath40 ) = aexp[(-b@xmath40)/@xmath38 ] with a = 11.4(1.1 ) and b = 1.61(2 ) [ fig .",
    "[ figsc](b ) ] @xcite .",
    "according to bcs theory , b = @xmath62 @xmath63@xmath64 , and thus a value of b = 1.61(2 ) predicts a superconducting gap of @xmath62 = 0.333(6 ) mev .",
    "this value , based on the electronic specific heat data , agrees with the superconducting gap of @xmath62 = 0.365(2 ) mev predicted using the critical temperature of @xmath40 = 2.40(1 ) k in the bcs relation 2@xmath62/(@xmath63@xmath40 ) = 3.53 .",
    "isothermal dc magnetization measurements were collected on an approximately cubic 100 mg single crystal of tl@xmath2te@xmath1 with ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) faces , allowing the orientation dependence to be examined . at @xmath38 = 1.8 k ,",
    "a full superconducting volume fraction is observed from both crystal directions under small applied magnetic field , and the upper critical fields , h@xmath65(1.8 k ) = 480(30 ) oe and h@xmath66(1.8 k ) = 500(50 ) oe are within error .",
    "in contrast , the lower critical fields are found to differ by a factor of greater than three , as shown in fig . [",
    "figsc](c ) : @xmath67(1.8 k ) = 18(1 ) oe and @xmath68(1.8 k ) = 5(1 ) oe , where @xmath69(1.8 k ) is defined as the magnetic field , parallel to the _ i _ direction , at which the magnetic response deviates from a linear field - dependence .",
    "we call this @xmath69 rather than the strictly defined lower critical field @xmath70 because the presence of surface states may produce spurious effects in the measured magnetic response .",
    "note this observed threefold anisotropy is merely a lower bound of the extent of the anisotropy present in the bulk superconducting state : any intrinsic material defect of the crystal or minor experimental misalignment would result in contribution from the perpendicular direction .",
    "in short , tl@xmath2te@xmath1 appears to be a single - gap bcs superconductor . it is thus an ideal material in which to probe whether topological surface states participate in superconductivity , or how these gapless states affect , and are affected by , the bulk superconducting gap .",
    "charge carriers in dirac - like bands have a linear energy - momentum relationship described by the dirac equation ; they offer the unique opportunity to investigate the intersection of special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the dirac cones of graphene are even - numbered and topologically trivial . in contrast , the surface states of z@xmath6 topological insulators and tcis are protected topologically by time - reversal and mirror symmetry , respectively .",
    "strong z@xmath6 topological insulators must have an odd number of band inversions at time - reversal invariant points to ensure protected surface states .",
    "electron transport on the surface of a z@xmath6 topological insulator is novel because the spin and momentum of surface electrons are  locked \" together .",
    "for this reason , topological insulators have a wide variety of potential applications .",
    "our results suggest a number of characteristics which make the [ tl@xmath0@xmath13te@xmath1 family an intriguing alternative to most other topological insulator families .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsnti](d ) , the truncation of the dirac cone indicates that [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 is @xmath71-type doped , in contrast to materials such as bi@xmath72se@xmath21 , which are typically @xmath73-type in the bulk .",
    "second , instead of the six - fold warping of the dirac cone away from the dirac point which is consistent with the trigonal structure of most topological insulators , the dirac cone in [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath3sn@xmath20te@xmath21 exhibits a four - fold warping consistent with its tetragonal symmetry . at higher binding energies",
    ", the surface state appears to intersect and begin to hybridize with the bulk bands [ such as around 0.6 ev in fig .",
    "[ figsnti](a ) ] , forming a surface resonance with some k@xmath24 dependence in the fermi velocity .",
    "however , at energies near e@xmath27 within the bulk bandgap , this band exhibits a slightly higher fermi velocity shown in fig .",
    "[ figsnti](c ) .",
    "third , dft analysis shows that the topological transition from trivial to non - trivial must occur in [ tl@xmath19(tl@xmath7sn@xmath74te@xmath21 as @xmath34 decreases . the sensitivity of this transition to structural parameters , particularly the @xmath35/@xmath36 ratio , suggesting that temperature- , pressure- , or stain - induced topological transition may be possible in this material family .",
    "the coexistence of topologically protected dirac - like surface states and superconductivity in tl@xmath2te@xmath1 make it a candidate ",
    "topological superconductor . \"",
    "topological superconductivity is highly sought after due to the prediction of massless majorana fermions , which have great potential to advance technology , specifically in the area of quantum computing , and to improve our knowledge of fundamental physics .",
    "although superconductivity has previously been achieved in topological systems via proximity effects and by doping , experiments investigating the phenomenon are hindered by several factors .",
    "for example , while superconductivity has previously been realized in cu@xmath9bi@xmath6se@xmath1 by intercalating copper into the van der waals gaps between layers , a small superconducting volume fraction is observed in this material @xcite .",
    "further , the substitution of copper for bismuth ( bi@xmath75cu@xmath9se@xmath1 ) competes with copper intercalation ( cu@xmath9bi@xmath6se@xmath1 ) , thereby limiting the attainable cu dopant concentration and producing inhomogeneous samples @xcite .",
    "superconductivity in topological insulators has also been successfully induced in bi@xmath6(se / te)@xmath1 by the proximity effect , but studies are then limited to thin sample regions@xcite .",
    "sn@xmath7in@xmath9te and laptbi are also candidate materials , but the former is a tci and the latter lacks a center of inversion , complicating efforts to understand them @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these materials , the [ tl@xmath0@xmath13te@xmath1 family provides an ideal system to investigate the effects of topologically protected surface states on superconductivity because tl@xmath2te@xmath1 is an intrinsic bulk superconductor that is straightforward to synthesize and computationally model .",
    "s bulk superconductivity eliminates the experimental obstacles faced in doped or proximity - induced topological superconductors , such as low superconducting volume fraction , sample inhomogeneity , and size limitations .",
    "further , the wide range of cations reported to substitute for the @xmath13 site , as well as the possibility of substituting other chalcogens or halogens for tellerium , presents a versatile range of experimentally accessible doping levels and resultant properties to examine .",
    "the [ tl@xmath0@xmath13te@xmath1 family has an entirely different crystal structure than the known z@xmath6 topological insulators , which all have trigonal symmtry in the active units .",
    "because symmetry determines the type and number of time - reversal invariant momentum points in the brilliouin zone of a material as well as its mirror planes , the structure type of a material is an important factor in whether dirac surface states exist and whether they are topologically non - trivial .",
    "our finding of topological surface states in perovskites therefore has important materials implications .",
    "other members of the [ tl@xmath0_m_te@xmath1 family likely exhibit similar topological properties in conjunction with other emergent phenomena including superconductivity . more generally , our results open the door to finding topologically protected states in other members of the largest known material family  perovskites .",
