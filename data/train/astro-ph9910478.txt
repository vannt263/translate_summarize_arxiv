    "until now , it has been impractical to make wide - field ground - based surveys at infrared wavelengths longer than @xmath13 .",
    "although the atmosphere is transparent in wavelength windows in the near infrared out to @xmath14 , sky brightness increases rapidly with increasing wavelength .",
    "detector area is limited by the need to read out quickly before saturation . the near infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the 10-m w.  m.  keck telescope , however , is equipped with a fast readout mode which allows it to read out its entire array quickly enough to avoid saturation in a short - wavelength @xmath15-band filter , centered on @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 bandpass is complementary to the standard near - infrared @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) bandpasses in a number of respects .",
    "it admits light at the rest - frame wavelengths of these bandpasses at redshifts of 1.7 , 1.0 , and 0.5 , so observations of intermediate and high - redshift galaxies can be compared directly to local analogs observed in the standard bandpasses .",
    "the @xmath0 bandpass can be used to extend the near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to longer wavelengths .",
    "while stellar populations are made up of a superposition of basically thermal radiators , nuclear activity tends to be redder than thermal ( in the near infrared , bluer in the visual ) and thus ought to become more prominent in redder bandpasses .",
    "nuclear activity may also heat nuclear dust to produce additional near - infrared emission ( eg , peletier et al 1999 ) . in units of @xmath22",
    ", the seds of normal galaxies peak at @xmath23 , primarily due to a minimum in h@xmath24 opacity in stellar atmospheres . at @xmath25 ,",
    "this peak is redshifted to @xmath0 .",
    "a `` non - evolving '' @xmath26 elliptical galaxy at redshift @xmath27 ought to appear as a @xmath28  mag source at @xmath0 . at @xmath27 ,",
    "old stellar populations are @xmath29 to @xmath30 mag brighter than young stellar populations with the same apparent @xmath31 magnitude ( coleman et al 1980 , aaronson 1977 ) .",
    "this paper presents the results of deep imaging of the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al 1996 ) in the @xmath0 bandpass with nirc .",
    "although neither the sky coverage nor the number of detected sources is large , to our knowledge this is the first deep near - infrared survey at wavelengths beyond the @xmath18 band .",
    "it extends the seds of hdf sources over a decade in wavelength from the f300w bandpass at @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of the hdf for deep imaging in this new @xmath0 bandpass was clear : the hdf is currently the most well - studied field on the sky , deeply imaged by almost every astronomical technique .    in what follows ,",
    "all magnitudes are vega - relative .",
    "the @xmath33 filter on nirc was chosen for this study .",
    "the filter passes light in the wavelength range @xmath34 .",
    "when combined with typical atmospheric absorption conditions on mauna kea , the bandpass is concentrated in the wavelength range @xmath35 , with a small `` blue leak '' ( @xmath36 of the total transmission function ) in a narrow peak at @xmath37 .",
    "the central wavelength is @xmath38 for the filter plus atmosphere transmission function ; for this reason , magnitudes with this instrument and filter setup will be denoted @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath33 filter is currently the longest - wavelength bandpass in which nirc can read out its full @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) field area without saturation from sky brightness alone .",
    "a source with @xmath2=0~{\\rm mag}$ ] in the @xmath33 bandpass has a flux density of 330  jy .",
    "this approximate zeropoint is an interpolation between measured @xmath18 and @xmath15-band zeropoints , and is uncertain by no more than 10  percent .",
    "the selection of the hdf for deep study with hst is described elsewhere ( williams et al 1996 ) . within the hst - imaged portion of the hdf ,",
    "a set of subfields were chosen for deep study with nirc .",
    "these subfields were not chosen with regard to any particular `` interesting sources . ''",
    "rather , one subfield was chosen to lie roughly in the center of each wfpc2 ccd chip image , subject to guide star constraints ( these are the primary subfields a , b , c , and d ) , and additional subfields were chosen to fill in the gaps between these four primary subfields . in the end ,",
    "telescope time and weather restricted our study to five subfields , the primary four and subfield f , which lies between subfields c and d. the well - observed solid angle is roughly @xmath41 per subfield ( given dithering ) or a total of @xmath42 .",
    "the layout of the subfields is shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] , relative to the hst - imaged field .",
    "air mass of the observations ranged from 1.40 to 1.75 .",
    "the conditions were clear and apparently photometric for all nights , although there was some variation in the sky brightness .",
    "each individual exposure consisted of 1000 ( or , occasionally , 2000 ) 0.025  s or 0.029  s integrations coadded into a single image in hardware .",
    "a visual imaging offset guider pointing at a star maintained the tracking of the telescope .",
    "the observations were taken in half - hour or hour - long sets with random dithers over a @xmath43 range .",
    "the photometric sensitivity was determined by measuring faint standard stars ( elias et al 1982 , persson et al 1998 ) roughly once per hour during each night . during several of the nights , the measured sensitivity ( corrected for airmass )",
    "varied in an apparently linear way with time .",
    "the subfield most affected by this was subfield a , which shows no significant sources ( see below ) , so the variation in this subfield does not affect the results .",
    "the scatter of the individual standard - star measurements around the linear sensitivity trends is @xmath44 , but for the other four subfields , the trends themselves range between @xmath45 for subfield d and @xmath46 for subfield f. the uncertainty in the photometric calibration is thus no better than @xmath47 , but may be worse if the linear trends represent a serious photometric problem .",
    "the observing dates , integration times , and sensitivities of the final , stacked images of the subfields are given in table  [ tab : subfields ] .",
    "the data were processed by subtracting an average of the two adjacent images ( before and after ) from each image to eliminate artifacts introduced by varying sky brightness and field rotation resulting from the alt  azimuth configuration of the keck telescope . because the individual images show no significant sources above the sky noise , registration of the individual images",
    "was accomplished with telescope coordinates as computed from the positions of the star in the guider camera .",
    "the individual registered images were averaged , after dark subtraction and flat - fielding , to produce the final images shown in fig  [ fig : mosaic ] .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel rms values in the central parts of the images correspond to @xmath48  mag in @xmath49 ; the specific values for each subfield are given in table  [ tab : subfields ] .",
    "because there are so few sources visible per subfield ( none for subfield a ) , determination of the seeing is difficult .",
    "seeing values given in table  [ tab : subfields ] are determined by comparison of the sources in the final , stacked images to their visual counterparts in the wfpc2 image of the hdf taken in the f814w bandpass ( williams et al 1996 ) ; they are necessarily quite uncertain . since in several fields ( especially f ) the seeing in the final ,",
    "stacked image is apparently worse than that for the standard stars , some of the seeing must arise from poor registration of the frames coadded in the stacks .    for visual images , the `` version 2 '' reductions of the hst / wfpc2 imaging of the hdf",
    "were used .",
    "details of the data acquisition , reduction , and sensitivities are given elsewhere ( williams et al 1996 ) .",
    "for brevity , the f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w bandpasses will be referred - to here as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath31 , and @xmath52 , although f300w and f606w are substantially different from conventional @xmath50 and @xmath31 .    for other near - infrared data , the `` version 1.04 '' reductions of the imaging of the hdf taken with the nicmos instrument on hst were used .",

    "for brevity , the f110w and f160w bandpasses will be referred - to here as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , although f110w is substantially bluer than standard @xmath16 .",
    "the photometric sensitivities of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 data are uncertain at the @xmath53  percent level .",
    "sources were identified in the @xmath0 image by requiring a positive deviation of greater significance than @xmath54 inside a focal - plane aperture of @xmath55 diameter in the final , stacked images of the subfields .",
    "the @xmath56 noise levels were estimated by measuring fluxes in randomly placed apertures , so they correctly take into account any pixel - to - pixel correlations . at significances less than @xmath57 , it was established that the sources had visual and near - infrared counterparts in the hst images .",
    "no @xmath54 deviations failed to show counterparts , except at the very edges of the subfields , where the noise and background flatness are degraded .",
    "a total of 11 sources were selected .",
    "the total area subject to source detection is roughly @xmath42 .",
    "total magnitudes @xmath2_{\\rm total}$ ] for the sources selected at @xmath0 were estimated by measuring aperture magnitudes @xmath2_{\\rm ap}$ ] in focal - plane apertures of @xmath58 diameter and then correcting for the small size of the aperture .",
    "the @xmath58 aperture was chosen to be small enough to reduce the background at @xmath0 but large enough to reduce variations in photometric sensitivity measured from the standard stars to below @xmath59 .",
    "the aperture corrections were determined under the assumption that there are only small color gradients in @xmath60)$ ] color , by comparing @xmath61 and @xmath62 diameter aperture magnitudes in the very high signal - to - noise @xmath17-band image , smoothed to the seeing of the @xmath0 image .",
    "( the one exception is the star at @xmath63 + @xmath64 , for which a @xmath65 diameter aperture was used in order to avoid light from the neighboring bright galaxy . )",
    "aperture and total magnitudes for the sources are given in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "the uncertainties given in table  [ tab : catalog ] are based only on the photon statistics and the uncertainties in determining the sky level , and do not include uncertainties in the photometric sensitivity .",
    "no estimate is made for the uncertainties in the aperture corrections .",
    "these may be considerable , if the seeing estimates are in error , if there are significant color gradients , or if there is significant light outside of the @xmath62 diameter aperture .",
    "colors were measured in @xmath58 diameter focal - plane apertures in the visual wfpc2 and near - infrared nicmos images , smoothed to the seeing of the @xmath0 images .",
    "the aperture size was chosen so the colors were measured in the regions of the sources which are well - measured at @xmath0 .",
    "the colors are given in table  [ tab : colors ] .",

    "although the nicmos @xmath16 and @xmath17 measurements have a very high signal - to - noise ratio , the photometric sensitivities are uncertain at the @xmath70  percent level ( dickinson et al 2000 )",

    "figure  [ fig : thumbnail ] shows the visual and near - infrared counterparts of all the sources .",
    "absolute ra and dec positions were assigned to the sources under the assumption that the absolute astrometry of the visual hst images of the hdf ( williams et al 1996 ) is correct .",
    "these absolute positions are given in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "the catalog selected at @xmath0 can be compared with other catalogs made in the hdf at other wavelengths or with other techniques .",
    "the redshifts and flux densities at other wavelengths discussed in this section are presented in tables  [ tab : colors ] and [ tab : counterparts ] .",
    "redshifts were found by comparing the coordinates of the sources with the lists of redshifts obtained in the hubble deep field with the keck telescope ( cohen et al 1996 ; lowenthal et al 1997 ; cohen et al 2000 ) .",
    "two of the sources are galactic stars , consistent with their stellar appearance on the hst images .",
    "flux densities in the @xmath72 band ( @xmath73 ) were found by matching the absolute positions of the @xmath0 sources with the positions of the sources from the @xmath72-selected catalog of hogg et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "flux densities at @xmath74 and @xmath75 were found by matching with the catalogs made from imaging data from the infrared space observatory ( aussel et al 1999 ; based on data from serjeant et al 1997 ) .",
    "flux densities at @xmath9 were taken from the catalog made from the scuba instrument at jcmt ( hughes et al 1998 ) , although the sources were identified in part through comparing positions derived from @xmath11 observations ( richards 1999a ) .",
    "flux densities at @xmath76 and @xmath11 were found by matching positions in catalogs made with vla data at these frequencies ( richards et al 1998 ; richards 1999b ) .    the detection fraction at @xmath0 of known near - infrared sources was tested by identifying sources in the nicmos / hdf catalogs ( dickinson et al 2000 ) satisfying @xmath77_{\\rm predicted } = f160w - 1.85\\,(f110w - f160w ) + 0.25 < 18\\ ] ] which corresponds to an approximate linear extrapolation ( in log - log space ) of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes to @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "( this equation is roughly appropriate for predicting the fluxes of galaxies and nuclear emission , since both have seds which resemble power - laws at @xmath78 ( observed ) at the redshifts of interest . )",
    "all nine sources inside the region of the hdf well - observed at @xmath0 with @xmath2_{\\rm predicted}<17.0 $ ] have counterparts in the catalog selected at @xmath0 , and of the the six sources in the well - observed region with @xmath79_{\\rm predicted}<18.0 $ ] , two have counterparts in the catalog .",
    "images of the hubble deep field at @xmath0 , taken with the 10-m keck telescope were presented , representing the first near - infrared survey of the distant universe at wavelengths beyond the @xmath18 band .",
    "the images cover a total area of @xmath1 .    to a 5-sigma limit of @xmath2_{\\rm total}\\approx 17.5~{\\rm mag}$ ] ( vega - relative ) ,",
    "11 sources are detected , 9 of which are extragalactic .",
    "the integrated galaxy number counts are therefore @xmath3 to this depth .",
    "the sources detected at @xmath0 have a median redshift of @xmath80 .",
    "all @xmath0 sources have @xmath81 , @xmath82 and visual counterparts .",

    "[ fig : colors ] , the source colors are compared with no - evolution predictions , based on observations of local galaxies ( coleman et al 1980 , aaronson 1977 ) and simple models of the filter transmission curves . although the sources selected at @xmath0 are among the reddest visually - selected galaxies , they are blue relative to no - evolution predictions",
    ". the blue colors are likely a consequence of higher star formation rates at intermediate redshift than in the present - day universe , as has been inferred , among other ways , from metallicity in lyman - alpha clouds ( pei & fall 1995 ) , ultraviolet luminosity density ( lilly et al 1996 ; connolly et al 1997 ; madau et al 1998 ) and emission line strengths ( hammer et al 1997 ; heyl et al 1997 ; small et al 1997 ; hogg et al 1998 ) . the lack of very red sources does not constrain the abundance of `` extremely red objects '' ( eros ) because , at the magnitudes of interest , the angular number density of eros is on the order of @xmath83 ( hu & ridgeway 1994 ; thompson et al 1999 ) .",
    "the morphologies of the @xmath0 sources in the visual and near - infrared bandpasses are shown in figure  [ fig : thumbnail ] .",
    "the sample is small , but they appear fairly regular , with some showing nearby neighbors or evidence for mild interaction .    comparisons with surveys of the hdf at other wavelengths show that all of the @xmath0 sources have @xmath73 counterparts , one has a @xmath7 counterpart , several have @xmath75 counterparts , one has a likely @xmath9 counterpart , and two have @xmath10 counterparts .",
    "furthermore , there are @xmath78 detections of the majority of sources which , on the basis of their @xmath6 and @xmath81 photometry , ought to have been detected",
    ".    in short , the @xmath0 imaging of the hdf shows no great surprises .",
    "it does demonstrate that it is possible , with significant telescope time , to perform studies of normal galaxies at high redshifts in the @xmath15 band of atmospheric transmission .",
