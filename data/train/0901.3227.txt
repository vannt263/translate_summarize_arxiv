    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in iron arsenides@xcite was an exciting breakthrough in the year 2008,@xcite which has led to a number of new superconductors@xcite all containing antifluorite - like feas or fese layers .",
    "in most cases , superconductivity was induced by doping charge carriers into a stoichiometric parent compound which shows a collinear antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave ground state@xcite .",
    "the chemical doping was initially carried out only outside the feas layers,@xcite with the electronic phase diagram@xcite resembling that of cuprate superconductors .",
    "later , however , it was found that the even doping at the fe site ( with co@xcite or ni@xcite ) could induce superconductivity .",
    "besides , superconductivity was able to be stabilized in the parent compounds simply by applying hydrostatic pressures.@xcite the latter two results contrast sharply with those in cuprates .",
    "very recently , we observed superconductivity at 26 k in eufe@xmath6as@xmath6 by the partial substitution of arsenic with phosphorus.@xcite this isovalent substitution does not introduce additional electrons or holes into the system , thus it can be roughly understood in terms of chemical pressures .",
    "owing to the ferromagnetic ordering of eu@xmath7 moments below 20 k coexisted with superconductivity , the meissner effect was not obvious .",
    "subsequently , we found that the p / as substitution induced superconductivity in a prototype `` 1111 '' material lafeaso , but the superconducting critical temperature @xmath3 is only @xmath810 k,@xcite which is substantially lower than the @xmath3 value under physical pressures@xcite .",
    "here we employ the same doping strategy on another prototype `` 122 '' parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "bulk superconductivity up to 30 k with strong meissner diamagnetism has been observed for @xmath4=0.32 .",
    "our systematic measurements of resistivity and magnetization reveal an electronic phase diagram characterized by a dome - like superconducting region located near a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the present work is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction which shows a unique type of qcp resulting from a competition between electronic localization and itinerancy.@xcite",
    "polycrystalline samples of bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 ( with the nominal p content @xmath4=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.45 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 and 0.9 and 1 ) were synthesized by solid state reaction with the high - purity elements ba , fe , as and p. mixture of the elements in the stoichiometric ratio was pressed into pellets in an argon - filled glove - box .",
    "the pellets were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes and annealed at 600 k for 12 h , then at 1173 k for 40 h. the resultant was reground , pelletized , and annealed in evacuated quartz tubes at 1273 k for 24 h. finally the samples were cooled down to room temperature by shutting off the furnace .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed at room temperature using a d / max - ra diffractometer with cu - k@xmath9 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",
    "the structural refinement was performed using the programme rietan 2000.@xcite the electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four - probe method .",
    "the measurements of dc magnetization were performed down to 1.8 k on a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) .",
    "both the zero - field - cooling ( zfc ) and field - cooling ( fc ) protocols were employed under the magnetic field of 10 oe .",
    "bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 system crystallizes in thcr@xmath6si@xmath6-type structure with the space group i4/_mmm_. except the main phase , minor secondary phase was identified as fe@xmath0p . figure 1(a )",
    "shows the xrd pattern and its rietveld refinement profile of a typical bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 sample with @xmath4=0.35 at room temperature .",
    "the two - phase rietveld refinement is successful , as indicated by the fairly good reliability factors @xmath10=8.5% and @xmath11=1.8 .",
    "it was found that the fitted p content is a little lower than the nominal one , consistent with the existence of impurity fe@xmath0p ( about 10% in molar ratio ) .",
    "the refined lattice parameters plotted as functions of @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "the cell volume decreases monotonically with the p doping .",
    "we notice that , for the samples with no significant fe@xmath0p impurity ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath4=0.45 and 0.9 ) , the data points of the cell volume fall exactly on the straight line , in accordance with the vegard s law .",
    "therefore , the actual p content can be estimated from the measured cell volume , which gives the corrected p content @xmath12=0.02 , 0.13 , 0.2 , 0.24 , 0.32 , 0.36 , 0.47 , 0.56 , 0.63 and 0.77 for the nominal @xmath4 values of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8 , respectively .",

    "a remarkable difference is seen from the position of as / p .",
    "the p doping makes the pnictogen atoms move toward the iron sheets , which leads to a dramatic decrease of feas - layer thickness .",
    "this explains why the decrease in @xmath14-axis is more pronounced ( compared with the @xmath15-axis ) , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the spacing of feas layers decreases little with p doping .",

    ", @xmath18 drops rapidly below 140 k , consistent with previous report@xcite .",
    "the resistivity anomaly was revealed to be associated with a simultaneous structural and spin - density - wave ( sdw ) transition.@xcite upon doping with p , the transition is suppressed , exhibiting the decrease of transition temperature ( @xmath19 ) and the weakening of the resistivity drop . for example , @xmath19 is suppressed to @xmath8 90 k for the sample of @xmath12=0.13 , where only a resistivity kink appears .",
    "when the p content increases to 20% , a sudden decrease in resistivity is seen below 10 k in addition to an observable kink at @xmath8 70 k. the resistivity drop at lower temperature is due to a superconducting transition ( confirmed by the magnetic measurements below ) . in the intermediate doping range ( 0.24@xmath200.63 ) , superconductivity with higher @xmath3s was observed .",
    "the maximum transition temperature is 30 k for @xmath12=0.32 .",
    "the resistive transition tail is probably due to the influence of grain boundaries and/or minor ferromagnetic fe@xmath6p impurity , rather than sample inhomogeneity , since nearly perfect diamagnetism was measured ( see below ) . for the higher p doping ( @xmath50.77 ) ,",
    "no superconductivity was observed down to 3 k. one notes that the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) , defined by the ratio of the resistance at room temperature to the residual resistance at very low temperature , is 20 , 35 and 75 for @xmath12=0.77 , 0.9 and 1.0 , respectively .",

    "3 . the sample of @xmath12=0.2 shows strong diamagnetic transition below 7 k , consistent with the drop in resistivity below 10 k shown in fig .",
    "2 . in spite of the large superconducting fraction ,",
    "however , it is difficult to ascertain whether sdw order coexists microscopically with superconductivity or not . for @xmath4=0.32",
    ", a stronger diamagnetic signal is observed below 30 k. the magnetic shielding is even beyond the ideal value of 100% apparently , since the demagnetization effect is not included here .",
    "the meissner volume fraction achieves @xmath8 30% , demonstrating the bulk nature of superconductivity .",
    "other superconducting samples also displays similar bulk property .",
    "( as@xmath21p@xmath22)@xmath0 .",
    "note that the magnetic background coming from the ferromagnetic impurity of fe@xmath6p has been removed .",
    "no correction of demagnetization has been made.,width=302 ]    as is known , the normal - state resistivity contains valuable information on electronic scattering and even superconducting mechanisms .",
    "dense polycrystalline samples may show intrinsic transport property because the grain boundaries scatter electrons like impurities . thus the following analysis is valid even though our data were obtained from polycrystalline samples . assuming that the intrinsic scattering produces a power - law resistivity at low temperatures , the total resistivity can be expressed as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents extrinsic resistivity coming from the impurity / defect scattering . by fitting the @xmath25 data in the range of @xmath2650",
    "k , the exponent @xmath27 was obtained .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "4 shows that most samples have the @xmath27-value close to 2.0 , suggesting fermi - liquid state due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "interestingly , @xmath27 is close to unity ( i.e. , linear @xmath28-dependent normal - state resistivity ) for the samples with @xmath12=0.3@xmath80.45 .",
    "the linear low - temperature resistivity belongs to a non - fermi liquid behaviour , as usually observed in the regime of quantum criticality .",
    "remember that the sdw order is suppressed with the p doping , we argue that there exists a qcp at @xmath291/3 in the bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 system .",
    "this result is quite consistent with a recent theoretical prediction which shows a unique type of qcp resulting from a competition between electronic localization and itinerancy@xcite .",
    "we aware that similar qcp was also proposed in ( k , sr)fe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite system .",
    "the electronic phase diagram is concluded in fig .",
    "4 . the undoped bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 has the ground state of sdw order . with the p doping ,",
    "@xmath19 decreases gradually , forming a phase region of sdw .",
    "the suppression of sdw can be easily explained in terms of @xmath30 model@xcite , because @xmath31 is expected to decrease upon p doping . on the other hand ,",
    "the scenario of fermi surface nesting@xcite is not quite straightforward to meet the experimental observation . in the vicinity of above - mentioned qcp , an asymmetric superconducting ( sc ) dome emerges . the optimal doping level ( with the maximum @xmath3 ) coincides with the qcp , where a non - fermi - liquid behviour shows up",
    "this strongly suggests that spin fluctuations play an important role for the superconductivity . in the overlapped area of sdw and sc ,",
    "it is not clear whether sdw coexists microscopically with sc at this moment .",
    "the upper - right metallic region displays fermi - liquid - like state , except that non - fermi - liquid behaviour appears near the qcp .",
    "this crossover in electronic excitation states resembles those of ( k , sr)fe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite and ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite systems .",
    "( as@xmath21p@xmath22)@xmath0 .",
    "sdw and sc denote spin - density - wave and superconductivity , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the variations of the exponent @xmath27 in the formula @xmath23 , obtained by the fitting of normal - state resistivity at low temperatures.,width=302 ]    it was reported that bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 became superconducting up to 29 k under the high pressure of @xmath84 gpa.@xcite the @xmath3 value is very close to the present one in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 .",
    "this implies that chemical pressure generated by p doping acts in a similar way to the physical pressure .",
    "meanwhile , the disorder induced by the p doping hardly influences superconductivity .",
    "the relatively low @xmath32 value ( compared with 38 k in ba@xmath33k@xmath34fe@xmath6as@xmath6@xcite ) can be well understood by an empirical structural rule for @xmath3 variations.@xcite a very recent work@xcite also reveals similarities between structural distortions under pressure and chemical doping in bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is the structural details of feas layers ( corresponding to specific electronic structures ) , rather than charge doping level , that controls the ground states in iron arsenides .    to summarize , bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 has been tuned superconducting through an isovalent doping of phosphorus at the arsenic site , for the first time . unlike previous doping strategy with changing the concentration of charge carrier , the present p doping does not alter the number of valence electrons .",
    "structural measurements indicates that the chemical pressure generated by the p doping impacts mainly on the feas layers .",
    "the p - for - as substitution suppresses the sdw ordering , and favors superconductivity , similarly to phenomena of the carrier doping@xcite .",
    "a magnetic qcp is evidenced simultaneously by the disappearance of sdw ordering and the non - fermi - liquid behaviour .",
    "the maximum @xmath3 of 30 k is observed where the qcp is located .",
    "theoretical studies@xcite indicate that superconductivity around magnetic qcp is associated with the spin fluctuation mechanism .",
    "thus the present result suggests that spin fluctuations play crucial role for the superconductivity in iron - based arsenides .",
