    "what follows are notes from some lectures i gave at a clay math conference at cmat in madrid in august , 2014 .",
    "i am endebted to the organizers for inviting me , and most particularly to jos burgos gil for giving me his notes .",
    "the subject matter here is ( a slice of ) modern physics as viewed by a mathematician . to understand what this means , i told the audience about my grandson who , when he was 4 years old , was very much into trains .",
    "( he is 5 now , and more into dinosaurs . ) for christmas , i bought him an elaborate train set . at first , the little boy was at a complete loss .",
    "the train set was much too complicated .",
    "amazingly , everything worked out !",
    "even though the train itself was hopelessly technical and difficult , the box the train came in was fantastic ; with wonderful , imaginative pictures of engines and freight cars .",
    "christmas passed happily in fantasy play inspired by the images of the trains on the box .",
    "modern physics is much too complicated for anyone but a `` trained '' and dedicated physicist to follow .",
    "however , `` the box it comes in '' , the superstructure of mathematical metaphor and analogy which surrounds it , can be a delightful inspiration for mathematical fantasy play .",
    "the particular focus of these notes is the feynman amplitude .",
    "essentially , to a physical theory the physicist associates a lagrangian , and to the lagrangian a collection of graphs , and to each graph a function called the amplitude on a space of external momenta .",
    "section [ configsect ] develops the basic algebra of the first and second symanzik polynomials in the context of configurations , i.e. invariants associated to a finite dimensional based vector space @xmath0 with a given subspace @xmath1 .",
    "section [ graph1 ] considers the first symanzik ( aka kirchoff polynomial ) @xmath2 in the case @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a graph @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a determinant , so the _ graph hypersurface _",
    "@xmath7 admits a birational cover @xmath8 with fibre over @xmath9 the projective space associated to @xmath10 .",
    "the main result in this section is theorem [ patterson ] .",
    "a classical theorem of riemann considers singularities of the theta divisor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the space of rational equivalence classes of divisors of degree @xmath15 on @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the subspace of effective divisors .",
    "one shows that @xmath17 is ( locally ) defined by the vanishing of a determinant , and the evident map @xmath18 has fibres the projectivized kernels .",
    "riemann s result is that the dimension of the fibre over @xmath19 is one less than the multiplicity of @xmath20 on @xmath17 .",
    "theorem [ patterson ] is the analogous result for @xmath21 , viz .",
    "@xmath22 .",
    "section [ lambda ] considers in more detail the hodge structure of @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that whereas the hodge structure for @xmath21 is subtle and complicated , the hodge structure on @xmath23 is fairly simple . in particular , @xmath23 is mixed tate",
    ".    sections [ 2symanzik]-[limit ] focus on the amplitude @xmath24 , viewed as a multi - valued function of external momenta .",
    "various standard formulas for @xmath24 are given in section [ 2symanzik ] .",
    "sections [ riemannsurfaces]-[limit ] develop from a hodge - theoretic perspective a result relating @xmath24 to a limit in string theory when the string tension @xmath25 .",
    "associated to @xmath5 is a family of stable rational curves which are unions of riemann spheres with dual graph @xmath5 .",
    "we view this family as lying on the boundary of a moduli space of pointed curves of genus @xmath26 .",
    "we show how external momenta are associated to limits at the boundary of marked points , and we explicit the second symanzik as a limit of heights .",
    "the amplitude @xmath24 then becomes an integral over the space of nilpotent orbits associated to the degeneration of the hodge structure given by @xmath27 of the curves .",
    "this is joint work with jos burgos gil , omid amini , and javier fresan .",
    "we are greatly endebted to p. vanhove and p. tourkine for their insights , ( @xcite and references cited there . )",
    "i met my co - authors at the conference , and this work grew out of an attempt to make sense of vague and imprecise suggestions i had made in the lectures .",
    "the last topic ( sections [ cutrules ] - [ cutthm ] ) concerns joint work with dirk kreimer on cutkosky rules .",
    "the amplitude @xmath24 is a multi - valued function of external momenta .",
    "cutkosky rules give a formula for the _ variation _ as external momenta winds around the _ threshold divisor _ which is the discriminant locus in the space of external momenta for the quadric propagators . over the years",
    "there has been some uncertainty in the physics community as to the precise conditions for cutkosky rules to apply . using a modified notion of vanishing cycle due to f. pham",
    ", we prove that cutkosky rules do apply in the case of what are called _",
    "physical singularities_.    perhaps a word about what is _ not _ in these notes . in recent years",
    ", there has been enormous progress in calculating feynman amplitudes .",
    "the work i should have liked to talk about is due to francis brown and oliver schnetz @xcite which exhibits an algorithm for calculating many feynman amplitudes and gives a beautiful example where the algorithm fails . in this case",
    "the amplitude is the period of a modular form .",
    "the whole subject of polylogarithms , which is intimately linked to amplitudes , is not addressed at all .",
    "i apologize ; there simply was nt time .",
    "finally , a shout - out to the organizers , most particularly kurusch ebrahimi - fard who worked very very hard on both the practical and scientific aspects of the conference .",
