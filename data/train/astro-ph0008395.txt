    "we estimated @xmath0 and @xmath1 color gradients , as well as total and bulge mean colors , for each galaxy of a sample of 257 barred and unbarred sbc systems , using the catalog of longo & a. de vaucouleurs ( 1983,1985 ) , which presents photoelectric aperture photometry data .",
    "the gradients were calculated through robust statistical methods , which consist essentially in applying the least median of squares regression ( rousseeuw 1984 ) .",
    "moreover , we have done a comparative photometric study through ccd images to atest the validity of the results obtained .",
    "our results , considering only face  on galaxies , indicate that @xmath2 59% of late  type galaxies have negative color gradients , @xmath2 27% have no gradients , and @xmath2 14% have positive gradients .",
    "furthermore , there is an excess of barred galaxies among systems with zero or positive color gradients ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that bars act as a mechanism of homogenization of the stellar population along late  type galaxies , a result which puts in trouble the monolithic scenario of eggen , lynden ",

    "we found a correlation between total and bulge colors , which is a consequence of an underlying correlation between the colors of bulges and disks found by other authors ( peletier & balcells 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , one can see in table 1 that the mean total color is approximately the same irrespective of the gradient regime , while bulges are systematically bluer in galaxies with null or positive gradients .",
    "these results seem to indicate that bars act changing the color of bulges due to secular dynamical processes ( see , e.g. , friedli & martinet 1993 ) , turning these bulges bluer , while disks are getting redder as a consequence of passive evolution .",
    "these effects are expected in the secular evolutionary scenario , but they are not consistent with the monolithic and hierarchical scenarios ( e.g. , kauffmann , guiderdoni , & white 1994 ) for spiral galaxy formation .",
    "we also found no correlation between color and chemical abundance gradients , suggesting that the color gradients are more sensitive to the age rather than to the metallicity of the stellar population .",
