    ", we would like to stress on a less studied aspect of thomas - fermi theory : the highly non - trivial scaling relations following from it .",
    "we show that the number of electrons , @xmath0 , and the coupling constant , @xmath2 , enter the ground - state energy in a scaled form .",
    "we perform extensive configuration interaction calculations for quantum dots with @xmath9 in order to verify this scaling .",
    "in addition , on the basis of the numerical results , we show that similar scaling relations are valid for the number of excited states in intraband and interband excitations . in this way",
    ", a universal parametrization of the density of energy levels in quantum dots is provided .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional parabolic quantum dot charged with @xmath0 electrons . in oscillator units",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as :    @xmath10    the only approximations made in writting eq .",

    "these approximations are very common and well sustained @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 is the ratio of coulomb and harmonic - oscillator characteristic energies .",
    "the fact that the number of electrons may enter the energy in a scaled combination with @xmath2 is , however , not trivial .",
    "let us write the thomas - fermi energy functional @xcite for the present problem :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the ( surface ) density at point @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a numerical constant .",
    "the above functional should be extremized under the constraint    @xmath17    now , it is easy to realize that we can scale @xmath15 and @xmath18 in such a way that the l.h.s . of eq .",

    ", we get the following relation for the ground - state energy in the thomas - fermi approximation :    @xmath20    notice that the scaled thomas - fermi equations depend on a single parameter , @xmath21 , which combines in a particular way the coupling constant and the number of electrons .",
    "we first provide an analytical expression for @xmath4 based on two - point pad approximants @xcite in the large-@xmath0 limit .",

    ". then , we can look for a simple interpolation formula in order to fit the numerical data for the excitation gap :    @xmath56    the parameter @xmath57 appears to be very close to 1/4 , thus we fixed it to 1/4 and fit again the data in order to obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
