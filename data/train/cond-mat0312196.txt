    "the problem of the so - called `` coffee - drop deposit '' has recently aroused great interest .",
    "the residue left when coffee dries on the countertop is usually darkest and hence most concentrated along the perimeter of the stain .",
    "ring - like stains , with the solute segregated to the edge of a drying drop , are not particular to coffee .",
    "mineral rings left on washed glassware , banded deposits of salt on the sidewalk during winter , and enhanced edges in water color paintings are all examples of the variety of physical systems displaying similar behavior and understood by coffee - drop deposit terminology .    understanding the process of drying of such solutions is important for many scientific and industrial applications , where ability to control the distribution of the solute during drying process is at stake .",
    "for instance , in the paint industry , the pigment should be evenly dispersed after drying , and the segregation effects are highly undesirable .",
    "also , in the protein crystallography  @xcite , attempts are made to assemble the two - dimensional crystals by using evaporation driven convection , and hence solute concentration gradients should be avoided . on the other hand , in the production of nanowires  @xcite or in surface",
    "patterning  @xcite perimeter - concentrated deposits may be of advantage .",
    "recent important applications of this phenomenon related to dna stretching in a flow have emerged as well  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a high - throughput automatic dna mapping was suggested  @xcite , where fluid flow induced by evaporation is used for both stretching dna molecules and depositing them onto a substrate .",
    "droplet drying is also important in the attempts to create arrays of dna spots for gene expression analysis .",
    "ring - like deposit patterns have been studied experimentally by a number of groups .",
    "difficulties of obtaining a uniform deposit  @xcite , deformation of sessile drops due to a sol - gel transition of the solute at the contact line  @xcite , stick - slip motion of the contact line of colloidal liquids  @xcite , and the effect of ring formation on the evaporation of the sessile drops  @xcite were all reported .",
    "the evaporation of the sessile drops ( regardless of solute presence ) has also been investigated extensively .",
    "constancy of the evaporation flux was demonstrated  @xcite , and the change of the geometrical characteristics ( contact angle , drop height , contact - line radius ) during drying was measured in detail  @xcite .",
    "the most recent and complete experimental effort to date on coffee - drop deposits was conducted by robert deegan _",
    "et al . _",
    "most experimental data referred to in this work originate from observations and measurements of this group .",
    "they reported extensive results on ring formation and demonstrated that these could be quantitatively accounted for .",
    "the main ideas of the theory of solute transfer in such physical systems have also been developed in their work  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the contact line of a drop of liquid remains pinned during most of the drying process . while the highest evaporation occurs at the edges , the bulk of the solvent is concentrated closer to the center of the drop . in order to replenish the liquid removed by evaporation at the edge , a flow from the inner to the outer regions must exist inside the drop . this flow is capable of transferring all of the solute to the contact line and thus accounts for the strong contact - line concentration of the residue left after complete drying .",
    "the idea of this theory is very robust since it is independent of the nature of the solute and only requires the pinning of the edge during drying ( which can occur in a number of possible ways : surface roughness , chemical heterogeneities _ etc _ ) .",
    "this theory accounts quantitatively for many phenomena observed experimentally ; among other things , we will reproduce its main conclusions in this work .",
    "mathematically , the most complicated part of this problem is related to determining the evaporation rate from the surface of the drop .",
    "an analogy between the diffusive concentration fields and the electrostatic potential fields was suggested  @xcite , so that an equivalent electrostatic problem can be solved instead of the problem of evaporation of a sessile drop .",
    "important analytical solutions to this equivalent electrostatic problem in various geometries were first derived by lebedev  @xcite .",
    "a number of useful consequences from these analytical results were later reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we discuss the theory of solute transfer and deposit growth in evaporating sessile droplets on a substrate and provide quantitative account for many observed phenomena and measurement results .",
    "chapter  2 discusses the main ideas and the general theory ; all principal equations are derived in that chapter . while most of its equations have been reported previously , the derivation presented here is original and deals with some mathematical issues never fully addressed before in the context of the current problem .",
    "chapter  2 is the basis for all the following chapters of this work , and its content is required for all the other chapters .",
    "while the principal equations are fully derived and presented in chapter  2 , their solution depends heavily on the geometry of the drop .",
    "the flow pattern discussed in this work is a type of hydrodynamic flow that is sensitive to the perimeter shape , _",
    "i.e. _  the shape of the contact line .",
    "mathematically , solution to the differential equations depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "chapters  3 and 4 discuss the analytical solution to this problem in two important geometries .",
    "the two geometries are the drops with circular boundary ( round drops ) and the drops with angular boundary ( pointed drops ) .",
    "the choice of these two geometries is not accidental .",
    "an arbitrary boundary line can be represented as a sequence of smooth segments , which can be approximated by circular arcs , and fractures , which can be approximated by angular regions .",
    "thus , knowledge of analytical solution for both circular ( chapter  3 ) and angular ( chapter  4 ) boundary shapes fills out the quantitative picture of solute transfer and deposit growth for an arbitrary drop boundary .    the case of the round drops",
    "is the most important from the practical point of view and the easiest to deal with mathematically .",
    "this case allows for a full analytical solution , and this solution has been obtained earlier . here , in chapter  3 , we reproduce concisely the earlier results and report some new ones . its content is a prerequisite to chapter  5 , but is not essential for understanding chapter  4 ( although it is used for drawing some parallels and for comparison of the results in the two geometries ) .",
    "the case of the pointed drops ( chapter  4 ) , while also important , is much more complicated mathematically than the round - drop solution is .",
    "presence of the vertex of the angle introduces a singularity at this vertex in addition to the weaker singularity at the contact line .",
    "singularities govern the solutions to differential equations , and thus presence of the angle and its vertex changes the results substantially .",
    "also , an angular region , as a mathematical object , is infinite , while a circular region is always bounded .",
    "the real drops with a fracture must always have a third ( the furthest from the vertex ) side of its contact line , and therefore the overall solution depends on the shape of that furthest part of the boundary . at the same time , we are interested only in the universal features of the solution that are independent of that furthest part . keeping in mind this lust for universality and the mathematical complexity mentioned above , we specify only one boundary of the drop ( the vertex and the two sides of the angle ) leaving the remainder of the boundary curve unspecified .",
    "such an approach turns out to be sufficient to determine the universal features of the solution , and it allows us to find all the important singularities as power laws of distance from the vertex of the angle .",
    "most of the results of chapter  4 were originally obtained in our earlier works  @xcite .",
    "chapters  4 and 5 are completely independent of each other .",
    "chapters  24 address the issue of the deposit mass accumulation at the drop boundary , however , they treat the solute particles as if they do not occupy any volume , and hence all the solute can be accommodated at the one - dimensional singularity of the contact line . in reality , the solute deposit accumulated at the perimeter of a drying drop has some thickness , for instance , the shape of the solute residue in a round drop is more like a ring rather than an infinitely thin circumference of the circle .",
    "we attribute this finite volume of the solute deposit simply to the finite size of the solute particles , _",
    "i.e. _  we assume the particles do occupy some volume and hence can not be packed denser than certain mass per unit volume .",
    "a model accounting for the finite size of the deposit and determining its geometric characteristics ( height , width ) is considered in chapter  5 .",
    "the model is solved for the simplest case of circular geometry , and its results are compared to the zero - volume results of chapter  3 and to the experimental results of refs .",
    "both the analytical and the numerical solutions are provided , and both compare well with the experimental data ( and with each other ) .",
    "results of chapter  5 are presented for the first time .",
    "a chapter of conclusions completes this work .    before proceeding to the main matter",
    ", we would like to point out some features common to all our results and giving rise to the title of this work .",
    "flows found here are capable of transferring 100% of the solute to the contact line , and thus account for the strong perimeter concentration of the solute in all cases .",
    "many quantities scale as power laws ; some others follow different functional dependencies .",
    "however , both the exponents of the power laws and any elements of the other functional dependencies turn out to be _ universal _ within our model .",
    "they do not depend on any parameters of the system other than the system geometry . within the range of applicability of our theory ,",
    "there are no fitting parameters , no undetermined constants , and no unknown coefficients .",
    "thus , for instance , exponents of the power laws are as universal as the exponent of distance @xmath0 in the coulomb s law .",
    "we view this universality as one of the main advantages and one of the most exciting features of this theory .",
    "in this chapter we will present the general theory of solute transfer to the contact line that will subsequently be solved analytically for two important geometries .",
    "we consider a sessile droplet of solution on a horizontal surface ( substrate ) .",
    "the nature of the solute is not essential for the mechanism .",
    "the typical diameter of the solute particles in deegan s experiments was of the order of 0.11  @xmath1 m ; we will assume a similar order of magnitude throughout this work .",
    "for smaller particles diffusion becomes more important compared to the hydrodynamic flows of this work . for larger particles sedimentation may become important when particles exceed certain size .",
    "the droplet is bounded by the contact line in the plane of the substrate .",
    "the ( macroscopic ) contact line is defined as the common one - dimensional boundary of all three phases ( liquid , air and solid substrate ) .",
    "we will not specify the shape of the contact line in this chapter ; in the later chapters we will make this selection and describe the two qualitatively different limits  circular drops and angular drops . as we explained in the introduction , these shapes account for the smooth and fractured segments of an arbitrary contact line .",
    "main equations are not sensitive to the particular geometry , only the boundary conditions are .",
    "we assume that the droplet is sufficiently small so that the surface tension is dominant , and the gravitational effects can be safely neglected .",
    "mathematically , this is controlled by the bond number @xmath2 , which accounts for the balance of surface tension and gravitational force on the surface shape . here",
    "@xmath3 is the density of fluid , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is a typical size of the drop in the plane of the substrate , @xmath6 is the maximal height of the drop at the beginning of the drying process , and @xmath7 is the surface tension at the liquid - air interface . for the typical experimental conditions the bond number is of the order of 0.020.05 , and thus gravity indeed is unimportant and surface shape is governed mostly by the surface tension .    at the same time , we do _ not _ assume that the contact angle @xmath8 between the liquid - air interface and the plane of the substrate is constant along the contact line on the substrate , nor do we assume it is constant in time . to achieve a prescribed boundary shape ( other than a perfect circle on an ideal plane ) , the substrate must have scratches , grooves or other inhomogeneities ( sufficiently small compared to the dimensions of the droplet ) , which _ pin _ the contact line .",
    "a strongly pinned contact line can sustain a wide range of ( macroscopic ) contact angles .",
    "the contact angle is not fixed by the interfacial tensions as it is on a uniform surface ( fig .",
    "[ contactangleeps ] ) . throughout this work",
    "we will deal with small contact angles ( @xmath9 ) as is almost always the case in the experimental realizations ( typically , @xmath100.3 ) ; however , the general equations of this chapter do not rely on the smallness of the contact angle .",
    "we will use the cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 throughout this work , as most natural for both geometries of interest .",
    "coordinate @xmath12 is always normal to the plane of the substrate , and the plane itself is described by @xmath13 , with @xmath12 being positive on the droplet side of the space .",
    "coordinates @xmath14 are the polar radius and the azimuthal angle , respectively , in the plane of the substrate .",
    "the origin is chosen at the center of the circle in the circular geometry and at the vertex of the angle in the angular geometry .",
    "the geometry of the problem is quite complicated despite the visible simplicity . in both geometries of interest",
    ", we consider an object , whose symmetry does not match the symmetry of any simple orthogonal coordinate system of the three - dimensional space .",
    "for instance , solution of the laplace equation ( needed below ) requires introduction of the special coordinate systems ( the toroidal coordinates and the conical coordinates ) with heavy use of various special functions .",
    "similar difficulties related to the geometry arise in the other parts of the problem as well .",
    "we describe the surface shape of the drop @xmath15 by local mean curvature @xmath16 that is spatially uniform at any given moment of time , but changes with time as droplet dries .",
    "ideally , the surface shape should be considered dynamically together with the flow field inside the drop .",
    "however , as we show below , for flow velocities much lower than the characteristic velocity @xmath17 ( where @xmath7 is surface tension and @xmath18 is dynamic viscosity ) , which is about 24  m / s for water under normal conditions , one can consider the surface shape independently of the flow and use the equilibrium result at any given moment of time for finding the flow at that time .",
    "another way of expressing the same condition is to refer to the capillary number @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the characteristic value of the flow velocity of the order of 110  @xmath1 m/s ) , which is the ratio of viscous to capillary forces .",
    "this ratio is of the order of @xmath21@xmath22 under typical experimental conditions , clearly demonstrating that capillary forces are by far the dominant ones in this system and that surface shape is practically equilibrium and depends on time adiabatically .",
    "we consider _ slow _ flows , _ i.e. _  flows with low reynolds numbers ( also known as `` creeping flows '' ) .",
    "this amounts to the neglect of the inertial terms in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "as all the conditions above are , this is well justified by the real experimental conditions .",
    "we also employ the so - called `` lubrication approximation '' .",
    "it is essentially based on the two conditions reflecting the thinness of the drop and resulting from the separation of the vertical and horizontal scales .",
    "one is that the pressure inside the drop @xmath23 does not depend on the coordinate @xmath12 normal to the substrate : @xmath24 .",
    "the other is related to the small slope of the free surface @xmath25 , which is equivalent to the dominance of the @xmath12-derivatives of any component @xmath26 of flow velocity @xmath27 : @xmath28 ( index @xmath29 refers to the derivatives with respect to any coordinate in the plane of the substrate ) .",
    "the lubrication approximation is a standard simplifying procedure for this class of hydrodynamic problems  @xcite .    before proceeding to the main section of this chapter and formulating the main ideas of the theory",
    ", we will make a brief note on evaporation rate .      in order to determine the flow caused by evaporation",
    ", one needs to know the flux profile of liquid leaving each point of the surface by evaporation .",
    "this quantity will be seen to be independent of the processes going on inside the drop and must be determined prior to considering any such processes .    the functional form of the evaporation rate @xmath30 ( defined as evaporative mass loss per unit surface area per unit time ) depends on the rate - limiting step , which can , in principle , be either the transfer rate across the liquid - vapor interface or the diffusive relaxation of the saturated vapor layer immediately above the drop .",
    "we assume everywhere that the rate - limiting step is diffusion of liquid vapor ( fig .",
    "[ rlp ] ) and that evaporation rapidly attains a steady state .",
    "indeed , the transfer rate across the liquid - vapor interface is characterized by the time scale of the order of @xmath31  s , while the diffusion process has characteristic times of the order of @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the diffusion constant for vapor in air and @xmath5 is a characteristic size of the drop ) , which is of the order of seconds for water drops under typical drying conditions . also , the ratio of the time required for the vapor - phase water concentration to adjust to the changes in the droplet shape ( @xmath32 ) to the droplet evaporation time @xmath34 is of the order of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the density of saturated vapor just above the liquid - air interface and @xmath37 is the ambient vapor density  @xcite .",
    "thus , indeed , vapor concentration adjusts rapidly compared to the time required for water evaporation , and the evaporation process can be considered quasi - steady .",
    "as the rate - limiting process is the diffusion , the density of vapor above the liquid - vapor interface @xmath38 obeys the diffusion equation .",
    "since diffusion rapidly attains a steady state , this diffusion equation reduces to the laplace equation @xmath39 this equation is to be solved together with the following boundary conditions dependent on the geometry of the drop : ( a ) along the surface of the drop the air is saturated with vapor and hence @xmath38 at the interface is the constant density of saturated vapor @xmath36 , ( b ) far away from the drop the density approaches the constant ambient vapor density @xmath37 , and ( c ) vapor can not penetrate the substrate and hence @xmath40 at the substrate outside of the drop . having found density of vapor , one can obtain the evaporation rate @xmath41 , where @xmath33 is the diffusion constant .",
    "this boundary problem is mathematically equivalent to that of a charged conductor of the same geometry at constant potential if we identify @xmath38 with the electrostatic potential and @xmath42 with the electric field .",
    "moreover , since there is no component of @xmath42 normal to the substrate , we can further simplify the boundary problem by considering a conductor of the shape of our drop plus its reflection in the plane of the substrate in the full space instead of viewing only the semi - infinite space bounded by the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ evaprateeps ] ) .",
    "this reduces the number of boundary conditions to only two : ( a ) @xmath43 on the surface of the conductor , and ( b ) @xmath44 at infinity .",
    "the shape of the conductor ( the drop and its reflection in the substrate ) is now symmetric with respect to the plane of the substrate .",
    "this plane - symmetric problem of finding the electric field around the conductor at constant potential in infinite space is much simpler than the original problem in the semi - infinite space , and this will be the problem we will actually be solving in order to find the evaporation rate for the two geometries of interest .",
    "particular solution in each of the geometries will be presented in the next two chapters .",
    "having formulated physical assumptions intrinsic to the theory , we are now in position to state its main ideas .      the essential idea behind the theory has been developed in works of deegan _ et al . _",
    "it is an experimental observation that the contact line of a drop of liquid is pinned during most of the drying process . while the highest evaporation occurs at the edges , the bulk of the solvent is concentrated closer to the center of the drop . in order to replenish the liquid removed by evaporation at the edge , a flow from the inner to the outer regions must exist inside the drop .",
    "this flow is capable of transferring all of the solute to the contact line and thus accounts for the strong contact - line concentration of the residue left after complete drying .",
    "thus , a pinned contact line entails fluid flow toward that contact line .",
    "the `` elasticity '' of the liquid - air interface fixed at the contact line provides the force driving this flow .    to develop this idea mathematically",
    ", we ignore for a moment any solute in the liquid .",
    "once the flow is found , one can track the motion of the suspended particles , since they are just carried along by the flow .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe a generic method for finding the hydrodynamic flow of the liquid inside the drop , which is a prerequisite to knowing the details of solute transfer .",
    "we define depth - averaged flow velocity by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the in - plane component of the local three - dimensional velocity @xmath27 .",
    "then we write the conservation of fluid mass in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time , @xmath3 is the density of the fluid , and each of the quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a function of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "( we will drop the @xmath54 part of the second term everywhere in the following since it is always small compared to unity , as will be seen below . )",
    "this equation represents the fact that the rate of change of the amount of fluid in a volume element ( column ) above an infinitesimal area on the substrate ( third term ) is equal to the negative of the sum of the net flux of liquid out of the column ( first term ) and the amount of mass evaporated from the surface element on top of that column ( second term ) ; fig .",
    "[ consmasseps ] illustrates this idea .",
    "thus , this expression relates the depth - averaged velocity field @xmath55 to the liquid - vapor interface position @xmath56 and the evaporation rate @xmath57 .",
    "however , this is only one equation for two variables since vector @xmath51 has generally two components in the plane of the substrate .",
    "moreover , while the evaporation rate @xmath50 is indeed independent of flow @xmath51 , the free - surface shape @xmath49 should in general be determined simultaneously with @xmath51 .",
    "thus , there are actually three unknowns to be determined together ( @xmath49 and two components of velocity , say , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , and hence two more equations are needed .",
    "these additional equations will be of the hydrodynamic origin .",
    "we start with the navier - stokes equation with inertial terms omitted ( low reynolds numbers ) : @xmath60 where @xmath23 is the fluid pressure , @xmath18 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath27 is the velocity . applying lubrication - approximation conditions @xmath24 and @xmath28 , we arrive at the simplified form of this equation @xmath61 where index @xmath29 again refers to the vector components along the substrate . from now on we will suppress the subscript @xmath29 at the symbol of nabla - operator , and will assume for the rest of this work that this operator refers to the two - dimensional vector operations in the plane of the substrate .",
    "solution to the above equation with boundary conditions @xmath62 ( no slip at the substrate and no stress at the liquid - air interface ) yields @xmath63 or , after vertical averaging  ( [ defv ] ) , @xmath64 this result is a variant of the darcy s law  @xcite . note that since a curl of a gradient is always zero and @xmath18 is a constant , the preceding equation can be re - written as @xmath65 this condition is analogous to the condition of the potential flow ( @xmath66 ) , but with a quite unusual combination of the velocity and the surface height @xmath67 in place of the usual velocity @xmath51 .",
    "relation  ( [ darcy ] ) provides the two sought equations in addition to the conservation of mass  ( [ consmass ] ) .",
    "however , it contains one new variable , pressure @xmath23 , and hence another equation is needed .",
    "this last equation is provided by the condition of the mechanical equilibrium of the liquid - air interface ( also known as the young - laplace equation ) relating the pressure and the surface shape : @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the atmospheric pressure , @xmath7 is the surface tension , and @xmath16 is the mean curvature of the surface , uniquely related to the surface shape @xmath49 by differential geometry .",
    "note that this expression is independent of both the conservation of mass  ( [ consmass ] ) and the darcy s law  ( [ darcy ] ) .",
    "thus , the complete set of equations required to fully determine the four dynamic variables @xmath49 , @xmath23 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 consists of four differential equations ( together with the appropriate boundary conditions at the contact line , which are dependent on the particular geometry of the drop ) : one equation of the conservation of mass  ( [ consmass ] ) , two equations of the darcy s law  ( [ darcy ] ) , and one equation of the mechanical equilibrium of the interface  ( [ mechequil ] ) .",
    "they provide all the necessary conditions to solve the problem at least in principle .    in practice , however , solution of these four _ coupled _ differential equations is not possible in most geometries of practical interest . at the same time , under normal drying conditions the viscous stress is negligible , or , equivalently , the typical velocities are much smaller than @xmath70 ( for water under normal conditions ) . as we show in the appendix , the four equations _ decouple _ under these conditions . as a result",
    ", one can employ the equilibrium result for the surface shape @xmath49 at any given moment of time , and then determine the pressure and the velocity fields for this fixed functional form of @xmath49 .",
    "mathematically , the original system of equations can be rewritten as : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the leading and the first - order terms in the expansion of pressure @xmath78 in a small parameter @xmath79 inversely proportional to @xmath80 ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "note that @xmath76 is independent of @xmath14 , although it does depend on time ( this time dependence will be determined later in this work ) .",
    "therefore , there is a profound difference between equations  ( [ mechequil ] ) and ( [ laplace ] ) : the former is a local statement , with the right - hand side depending on the coordinates of a point within the drop , while the latter is a global condition of spatial constancy of the mean curvature throughout the drop .",
    "equation  ( [ laplace ] ) defines the _ equilibrium _ surface shape for any given value of @xmath76 at any given moment of time , and moreover , can be solved independently of the other equations .",
    "thus , the procedure for finding the solution becomes significantly simplified : first find the equilibrium surface shape @xmath49 from condition  ( [ laplace ] ) and independently specify the functional form of the evaporation rate @xmath50 from an equivalent electrostatic problem , then solve equation  ( [ psi ] ) for the reduced pressure @xmath81 , and finally obtain the flow field @xmath51 according to prescription  ( [ vpsi ] ) .",
    "the next two chapters will be devoted to the particular steps of this procedure for the two geometries of interest .    in the next section",
    ", we will describe how knowledge of flow inside the drop allows one to find the rate of solute transfer to the contact line and determine the laws of deposit growth .      with the velocity field inside the drop in hand",
    ", we can compute the rate of the deposit growth at the contact line .",
    "we assume that the suspended particles are carried along by the flow with velocity equal to the fluid velocity . integrating the velocity field : @xmath82 we find the streamline equation @xmath83 or @xmath84 , _ i.e. _  the trajectory of each particle as it moves with the fluid .",
    "this streamline equation is independent of the overall intensity of evaporation [ since both @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend on it as a multiplicative factor dropping out of eq .",
    "( [ vel - ratio ] ) ] , and thus the shape of the streamlines is universal for each geometry of the drop . physically , this indicates that solute particles move along the same trajectories independently of how fast evaporation occurs and hence how fast the flow is .",
    "given the shape of the streamlines , we can compute the time it takes an element of fluid ( having started from some initial point @xmath85 and moving along a streamline ) to reach the contact line .",
    "this time can be found by integrating both sides of either @xmath86 or @xmath87 with known dependences of @xmath58 or @xmath59 on the variables and known relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the streamline .",
    "the integrations are to be conducted from @xmath88 or @xmath89 ( at time 0 ) to @xmath90 or @xmath91 ( at time @xmath48 ) , respectively , where @xmath92 is the terminal endpoint of the trajectory on the contact line .",
    "thus , the initial location of particles that reach the contact line at time @xmath48 is characterized by @xmath85 .",
    "first , only particles initially located near the contact line reach that contact line .",
    "as time goes by , particles initially located further away from the contact line and in the inner parts of the drop reach the contact line .",
    "finally , particles initially located in the innermost parts of the drop ( _ e.g. _  at the center of a round drop or near the bisector of an angular drop ) reach the contact line as well .",
    "the more time elapsed , the more particles reached the contact line and the larger the area is where they were spread around initially .",
    "one can view this process as inward propagation of the inner boundary of the set of initial locations of the particles that have reached the contact line by time @xmath48 .",
    "as is easy to understand , the velocity of this front is equal to the negative of the vector of fluid velocity at each point ( the fluid and the particles move towards the contact line while this front moves away from it , hence a minus sign ) .    within the time computed in the preceding paragraph _ all _ the solute that lays on the way of an element of fluid as it moves toward the contact line becomes part of the deposit .",
    "now , we use our knowledge of the initial distribution of the solute , namely , that the solute has constant concentration @xmath93 everywhere in the drop at time @xmath94 , and compute the mass of the deposit accumulated at the contact line by that time .",
    "the mass of the deposit @xmath95 accumulated at the contact - line element of length @xmath96 can be found by integrating @xmath97 over area @xmath98 between two infinitesimally close streamlines ( terminating @xmath96 apart on the contact line ) swept by the infinitesimal element of fluid on its way to the contact line and multiplying the result by the initial concentration @xmath93 of the solute : @xmath99 obviously , this mass will depend of the initial location @xmath85 of the element of fluid .",
    "thus , both the time elapsed from the beginning of the drying process ( @xmath48 ) and the deposit mass accumulated at the contact line ( @xmath95 ) depend on the initial coordinates of the arriving element of fluid ( only one of the coordinates is actually an independent variable  the other is constrained by the streamline equation ) . eliminating these coordinates from the expressions for time and mass ,",
    "one can finally obtain the deposit mass accumulated at the contact line as a function of time elapsed from the beginning of the drying process .",
    "thus , the procedure described allows one to find the rate of solute transfer and the laws of deposit growth .",

    "[ massdist ] ) . in principle",
    ", this feature may have significant practical applications for all the processes mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in the preceding parts of this work we considered how mass of the contact - line deposit grows with time and how it depends on such geometrical characteristics of the drop as its radius ( circular drops ) or its opening angle and distance from the vertex ( pointed drops ) . however , we never attempted to describe the geometrical characteristics of the contact - line deposit itself , _",
    "e.g. _  the width and the height of the deposit ring in the case of circular geometry . at the same time",
    ", there is solid experimental data  @xcite on various geometrical characteristics of the ring and their dependence on time , the initial concentration of the solute , and the geometry of the drop . in this chapter",
    "we will provide a simple model that addresses this lack of theoretical understanding of the geometrical properties of the contact - line deposit and provides analytical results that compare favorably to the experimental data .",
    "this model is as universal ( in its range of validity ) as all the consideration above and provides the description that depends only on the geometry of the problem .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that particles have finite volume and they simply can not pack denser than some volume fraction , _ e.g. _  fraction of close packing .",
    "it turns out that this model is sufficient to explain most of the observed phenomena .",
    "the notion that the profile of the deposit could be found by the simple assumption that the solute becomes immobilized when the volume fraction reaches a threshold was originally suggested by todd dupont  @xcite .",
    "first efforts to create a model were conducted by robert deegan  @xcite who formulated most of the physical assumptions and wrote them down mathematically . here",
    "we present the entire problem , including its full formulation and its analytical and numerical solutions ( not reported in the literature previously ) .",
    "in this chapter we will restrict our attention to the circular geometry of the drop only , as this geometry is the easiest to deal with mathematically and the most important practically .",
    "we will continue to use cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 with the origin in the center of the drop . this will allow us to employ some results obtained for the circular drops earlier in this work .    as we already saw , it is necessary to assume that the contact angle is small in order to be able to obtain any analytical results in a closed form .",
    "this case is also most important practically , as virtually always @xmath9 in experimental realizations , including experiments of ref .",
    "thus , we do not lose any generality assuming that contact angle is small .",
    "this will be the only small parameter in this chapter .",
    "it is clear that a drop with a small contact angle is necessarily thin , _",
    "i.e. _  its maximal height is much smaller than its radius .",
    "therefore , it makes good sense to continue considering vertically averaged quantities , like the vertically averaged velocity @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ defv ] ) that we used in the three preceding chapters .",
    "our model pictures the drop as a two - component system ( the components are `` fluid '' and `` solute '' ) , which has two `` phases '' : the `` liquid phase '' in the middle of the drop and the `` deposit phase '' near the contact line .",
    "both components are present in both phases , and the difference between the phases lies in the concentration of the solute . in the deposit phase , volume fraction of solute @xmath23 is high ( _ e.g. _  comparable to close packing fraction or 1 ) and _ fixed _ in both space and time .",
    "thus , @xmath23 is just a constant number , one can think of it as close packing fraction or 1 .",
    "( the case of @xmath368 may seem to be special as there is no water in the deposit phase ; however , as will be seen below , for small initial concentrations of the solute this case leads to exactly the same main order results . ) in the liquid phase , volume fraction of solute @xmath369 varies in space and changes with time , and it is relatively small compared to @xmath23 .",
    "the initial volume fraction @xmath370 is constant throughout the drop ; at later moments the solute gets redistributed due to the hydrodynamic flows , and the concentration becomes different in different parts of the liquid phase .",
    "volume fraction of fluid is then @xmath371 in the deposit phase and @xmath372 in the liquid phase .",
    "note that we do not require @xmath373 in this section , although we do assume @xmath374 .",
    "we should also emphasize that we do not presume there is any real `` phase difference '' between the so - called phases : one phase is just defined as having the maximal reachable solute fraction @xmath23 ( solute can not move in this phase ) while the other phase is characterized by lower solute fraction @xmath369 ( in this phase solute can move and hence concentration can change in time and space ) . besides this difference , phases are essentially identical .",
    "the idea that the solute loses its mobility when its concentration exceeds some threshold was suggested by todd dupont  @xcite .",
    "since the drop is thin and since we employ vertically averaged velocity ( _ i.e. _  the problem is two - dimensional in certain sense ) , it is natural to assume the boundary between the phases is vertical .",
    "thus , the particles get stacked uniformly at all heights when being brought to the phase boundary by the hydrodynamic flow ( which does not depend on vertical coordinate @xmath12 ) .",
    "this boundary can be pictured as a vertical wall at some radius @xmath375 from the center of the drop , and this wall propagates from the contact line ( located at @xmath376 ) to the center of the drop .",
    "[ phaseseps ] illustrates the mutual location of the phases , and fig .",
    "[ evolutioneps ] schematically shows the time evolution of the drying process and growth of the deposit phase .",
    "the evaporation rate depends only on the overall shape of the drop , and evaporation occurs in the same fashion from both phases .",
    "we assume that evaporation is not influenced by any motion of the solute inside the drop , and the necessary amount of fluid can always be supplied to the regions of highest evaporation near the contact line .",
    "physically , high evaporation near the edge is what brings the solute to the contact line , and we assume that presence of the deposit does not obstruct the motion of fluid ( fig .  [ suckseps ] ) .",
    "since the drop is thin and the contact angle is small , we can use expression  ( [ evaprate - circular ] ) for the evaporation rate , which we used for the case of zero - volume particles , but with a slight modification  now , the radius of the drop is @xmath377 ( while @xmath375 stands for the radius of the inner boundary of the deposit phase , so that @xmath376 ) : @xmath378 here @xmath33 the diffusion constant , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the saturated and ambient vapor densities , respectively .",
    "the real situation may be different from the assumed above when @xmath23 is large or comparable to 1 , and the edge of the area where evaporation occurs may be located near the boundary of the phases instead of the contact line .",
    "however , for small initial concentrations of the solute , the main order result will be insensitive to the exact location of the singularity of the evaporation rate : whether it is located at the contact line or near the boundary of the phases .",
    "we will further comment on this case of `` dry deposit '' when we obtain the full system of equations .",
    "the geometry of the problem is shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry - ring ] .",
    "the radius of the drop is @xmath377 , the radius of the phase boundary is @xmath375 , and @xmath379 .",
    "the height of the phase boundary is @xmath380 , and the initial condition is @xmath381 .",
    "we conveniently split the height of the free surface of the liquid phase into the sum of @xmath380 and @xmath382 .",
    "since @xmath383 is independent of @xmath52 , function @xmath197 satisfies the young - laplace equation  ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "as is easy to see , the solution to this equation remains the same as in chapter  2 , and hence the shape of the upper part ( above the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ geometry - ring ] ) is just a spherical cap .",
    "thus , we can use expression  ( [ sphericalcap ] ) obtained for @xmath382 earlier , which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ h - circular ] ) in limit of small contact angles : @xmath384 here @xmath136 is the angle between the liquid - air interface and the substrate at phase boundary ( an equivalent of the contact angle ) . note that we do not assume that @xmath136 and @xmath382 are necessarily positive at all times : both can be negative at later drying stages , and the shape of the liquid - air interface may be concave .",
    "both convex and concave solutions for @xmath382 are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) ; the right hand side of this equation can have either sign . by definition ,",
    "both @xmath136 and @xmath382 are positive when the surface is convex ( and therefore they are positive at the beginning of the drying process ) and negative when the surface is concave .",
    "the initial value of @xmath136 coincides with the initial contact angle @xmath138 .     and",
    "@xmath385 . ]    clearly , there are three unknown functions of time in this geometry : @xmath136 , @xmath375 and @xmath380 .",
    "these three time dependences are to be determined in the subsequent sections of this chapter",
    ". however , these quantities are not independent of each other .",
    "if we assume that solute particles fill up the entire space between the substrate and the liquid - air interface when being brought to the phase boundary , it is easy to see that the three geometrical functions are related by the constraint @xmath386 physically , this assumption means that the angles between the liquid - air interface and the substrate are identical on both sides of the phase boundary ( @xmath387 ) , and hence @xmath197 and its first derivative are continuous past the phase boundary .",
    "this condition was first introduced by robert deegan  @xcite .",
    "thus , there are actually only two _ independent _ functions of time , @xmath136 and @xmath375 . in the case of zero - volume particles we had only one independent function of time",
    " contact angle @xmath136 .",
    "the geometrical definitions above allow us to find volume of each of the two phases .",
    "volume of the liquid phase is simply @xmath388 taking into account relation  ( [ constraint ] ) , an infinitesimal variation of this volume can be related to the infinitesimal variations of @xmath8 and @xmath5 : @xmath389 the first term is responsible for the motion of the liquid - air interface , and the second term corresponds to the shift of the phase boundary .",
    "it is also straightforward to obtain an expression for the differential of the volume of the deposit phase , which has only the term related to the inward motion of the phase boundary : @xmath390 we will use the last two expressions in the following section .",
    "we will also adopt the notation that subscripts l and d refer to the liquid and deposit phases , respectively .",
    "having formulated assumptions and having stated the model and the geometry , we are now in position to write the governing equations .",
    "if one were asked to express the essence of the entire theory in one sentence , this sentence would be : `` it is all about conservation of mass . ''",
    "indeed , as we will see by the end of this section , all three governing equations obtained here represent conservation of mass ( or volume ) in one form or another .",
    "we start from the global conservation of mass in the drop . since the amount of solute within the drop does not change , the change of the entire drop volume is equal to the change of the amount of fluid only .",
    "this fluid gets evaporated from the surface of the drop , and the total amount evaporated per unit of time from the entire surface of the drop equals to the total change of fluid volume in the drop .",
    "hence the total change of drop volume is equal to volume of fluid evaporated from the surface : @xmath391 by convention , superscripts f and s refer to the fluid and the solute components , respectively ( while subscripts l and d continue to denote phases ) .",

    "the volume of fluid evaporated from the surface of the drop during time @xmath395 can be determined from @xmath396 where , as in the rest of this work , @xmath3 is the density of the fluid and we neglected the gradient of @xmath197 with respect to unity ( which is always legitimate for thin drops )",

    "( [ consmass ] ) .",
    "now , one has to take into account that there are two components in the liquid phase and write a separate equation for each component .",

    "this is the case for most practical realizations of the ring deposits in experiments and observations : the solute concentration rarely exceeds 10% of volume , and in most cases it is far lower . if the volume fraction of the solute in the drop is small , then the solute volume is also small compared to the volume of the entire drop .",

    "why is the difference ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that the width measured in experiments  @xcite is not the full width of the ring at the end of the drying process , but rather the width of the ring at _ depinning_. depinning is a process of detachment of the liquid phase from the deposit ring ( fig .  [ depinning ] ) .",
    "this detachment was observed experimentally in colloidal suspensions but has not been explained in full theoretically yet .",

    "@xcite and our predictions depends on the details of deegan s calculation and its inherent assumptions ] .",
    "the square - root dependence of the height and the width on the concentration is in good agreement with general physical expectations .",
    "indeed , the volume of the deposit ring is roughly proportional to the product of the height and the width . on the other hand ,",
    "the height is of the same order of magnitude as the width since the ratio of the two is of the order of @xmath142 ( which is a constant ) .",
    "thus , both the height and the width scale approximately as a square root of the ring volume . finally , the volume of the deposit ring is proportional to the initial volume fraction of the solute : the more solute is present initially , the larger the volume of the deposit ring is at the end ( since the ring is comprised of only the initial amount of the solute ) .",
    "therefore , both the height and the width must scale as a square root of the initial volume fraction . it is rewarding that the results of our complex calculation match the results of this simple physical argument .",
    "thus , the complete analytical solution to our model is available in the limit @xmath505 , and this solution compares quite well to the experimental results . since the main - order solution in @xmath506 is perfectly adequate , the difference between the original system of equations and the one for the `` completely dry '' case is not important : in the main order in @xmath506 the results are identical for both cases ( since one case in different from the other only by presence of @xmath5 instead of @xmath377 in a few places in the main equations , and this difference is of the correctional order in @xmath506 ) .",
    "apart from approaching the original system of equations  ( [ constraint ] ) , ( [ main1 ] ) , ( [ main2 ] ) , and ( [ main3 ] ) analytically , we also solve the same system numerically . during this numerical procedure",
    "we do not presume that @xmath506 is small , nor do we expand any quantities or equations in @xmath79 or any other small parameters .",

    "it is to be noted that in the case of @xmath420 comparable to @xmath23 our model is not expected to produce any sensible results , as the entire separation of the drop into the two phases ( the liquid phase and the deposit phase ) is based on the assumption that the mobility of the solute is qualitatively different in the two regions .",
    "when @xmath420 is comparable to @xmath23 the two phases are physically indistinguishable , while the model still assumes they are different .",
    "therefore , it should be of absolutely no surprise if any results for @xmath507 are unphysical or unrealistic .",

    ", we terminate all the curves ( except @xmath509 ) in all the graphs at value of @xmath510 when _ all _ the solute reaches the deposit phase . in our model , it turns out that this time approximately coincides with the time the center - point of the liquid - air interface touches the substrate . for all the initial concentrations ( except @xmath508 ) , the time the center - point touches the substrate was numerically found to be within 0.1% of the time the very last solute particles reach the deposit phase .",
    "thus , within our model , the moment the center - point touches the substrate and the moment the last solute particles reach the deposit ring are about the same , and the curves are terminated at exactly this time .",
    "of course , in reality a small fraction of the solute stays in the liquid phase as long as the liquid phase exists , and so the moment the last solute particles reach the deposit phase must be _ after _",
    "the moment the center - point touches the substrate ; however , the amount of the solute remaining in the liquid phase at touchdown is insignificant , and thus practically all the deposit has already formed by that time ( 99.9% of all the solute is already in the ring ) .",

    "[ profileeps ] end at some positive ( non - zero ) height .",

    "thus , we used the depth - averaged velocity  ( [ defv ] ) throughout this work , and we also explicitly assumed the phase boundary is vertical and the particles get stacked uniformly at all heights ( _ i.e. _  the vertical distribution of the solute was assumed homogeneous ) .",

    "this assumption is quite important , and the results are expected to get modified if the true velocity profile  ( [ velocity - profile ] ) ( or any other three - dimensional distribution ) is used instead of the depth - averaged velocity . we expect that if a three - dimensional model were built and the dependence on @xmath12 were taken into account for all quantities then the discontinuous wall of the phase boundary would get smoothened and the height would continuously return to zero .",
    "a question remains whether such a model would be solvable analytically .",
    "our model relies on the assumption that the mobility of the solute is different in the so - called liquid and deposit phases .",
    "essentially , we assume that the mobility is 0 in the deposit phase and 1 in the liquid phase .",
    "this assumption , while artificial in its nature , seems relatively reasonable when applied to this system .",
    "indeed , in the physical situations near the close packing , the loss of mobility typically occurs over a quite narrow range of the concentration values , and hence our assumption should work satisfactorily when the difference between @xmath420 and @xmath23 is in the orders of magnitude .",
    "the higher the initial concentration is and the closer the two values are , the worse this assumption holds true and the more artificial the difference between the two phases is .",
    "we observe this in our numerical data : the numerical results for @xmath508 are quite unphysical , while the low - concentration results seem to be consistent and coherent with expectations .",
    "thus , the validity of any model based on this separation of the mobility scales decreases for higher initial concentrations of the solute .",

    "this assumption seems quite natural as well .",
    "indeed , if the liquid is present on both sides of the phase boundary , the change in the slope of its free surface would cost extra energy from the extra curvature at the phase boundary , since the liquid - air interface possesses effective elasticity . presence of this extra energy ( or the extra pressure ) at the location of the phase boundary is not justified by any physical reasons under the conditions of this chapter where processes are slow and the surface is in equilibrium . in equilibrium",
    "the surface shape must have constant curvature past the phase boundary since the entire separation into the two phases is quite artificial as discussed above .",
    "presence of the particles below the liquid - air interface does not influence the surface tension , and thus the liquid surface ( and its slope ) should be continuous at the phase boundary . on the other hand , if the density of the particles matches the density of the liquid ( which was the case in the experiments ) , nothing prevents the particles from filling up the entire space between the substrate and the liquid - air interface , thus providing the growth of the upper edge of the deposit phase _ along _ the liquid - air interface .",
    "this is particularly true for the thin drops discussed in this chapter ( @xmath419 was assumed throughout ) where the vertical mixing is intensive , where the free surface is nearly horizontal , and where the problem is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "however , the equality of the slopes on both sides of the phase boundary does _ not _ seem inevitable , and one may think of the situations when it does get violated .",
    "one example might be the late drying times when the deposit growth is very fast ( see fig .",
    "[ fractioneps ] ) and hence the deposition may occur in some non - regular manner inconsistent with the slow - process description of this chapter .",
    "other examples may be related to the gravity ( slightly unequal densities of the particles and the liquid ) or the convection . in any case , this assumption can possibly be checked experimentally , and if condition  ( [ constraint ] ) is found violated , an equivalent constraint dependent on the details of the deposit - growth mechanism must be constructed in place of eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) in order to relate functions @xmath136 , @xmath375 , and @xmath380 .",
    "another inherent assumption of our model is related to the evaporation rate @xmath130 .",
    "as we discussed at the beginning of this chapter , we assumed that presence of the solute inside the drop does not affect the evaporation from its surface .",
    "this is generally true when the evaporation is not too fast and the deposit phase is not too thick and not too concentrated .",
    "when these conditions are not obeyed , presence of a thick or concentrated layer of the solute on the way of the liquid moving from the phase boundary to the contact - line divergence of the evaporation rate may create a strong viscous force .",
    "this viscous force would prevent the necessary amount of the fluid from being supplied to the intensive - evaporation region near the contact line .",
    "generally , we assumed throughout this work that the viscous stresses are not important , and showed in chapter  2 and the appendix that this assumption is valid whenever @xmath520 . in the deposit phase ,",
    "the velocity is large due to the proximity to the contact - line divergence of the evaporation rate , and the effective viscosity is large due to the high concentration of the solute .",
    "thus , this condition may get violated and the viscosity may become important in the deposit phase , slowing down the supply of the liquid and ultimately making the deposit dry . obviously , this affects the evaporation rate , and the functional form of the evaporation profile changes .",
    "simple assumption that the evaporation rate stays of the same functional form , but with the divergence at the phase boundary ( at @xmath5 ) instead of the contact line ( at @xmath377 ) , was shown above not to affect our main - order results .",
    "thus , our results appear to be relatively insensitive to the exact location of this divergence within the ( narrow ) deposit phase .",
    "( in reality the evaporation edge would be somewhere between the contact line and the phase boundary , _ i.e. _  the real situation is intermediate between the two considered . ) however , the deposit could modify the evaporation rate @xmath130 in other ways .",
    "when there is a dry deposit ring just outside the liquid phase , the entire functional form of @xmath50 may change , and the laplace equation for an equivalent electrostatic problem must be solved anew with the additional boundary conditions responsible for the presence of the dry solute rim and the modified evaporation at the edge . as we already saw in all the preceding chapters , this is the most complicated part of the problem , and the mathematics can become prohibitively complex .",
    "thus , finding the exact form of @xmath50 may be a formidable task .",
    "one way around is in creating such evaporating conditions that the functional profile is simpler , for instance , @xmath50 is just a constant .",
    "this would be more difficult to control experimentally , but would be much easier to treat analytically .",
    "the unavailability of the exact analytical form for @xmath50 seems to be the biggest open question in this class of problems ( the same difficulty was also encountered for the pointed - drop solution of chapter  4 ) .",
    "the equilibrium surface shape of the liquid phase is a spherical cap  ( [ h - finite ] ) .",
    "this is a rigorous result proved in the preceding chapters and valid during most of the drying process .",
    "however , when @xmath521 becomes negative and exceeds @xmath380 in absolute value ( _ i.e. _  when the center - point touches the substrate ) , the surface shape is no longer spherical .",
    "moreover , a new element of the contact line is introduced in the center of the drop in addition to the original contact line at the perimeter , and the entire evaporation profile gets modified in addition to the modified surface shape , thus influencing all the other quantities .",
    "our treatment does not account for the small fraction of the drying process occurring after this touchdown ( which is a change in topology of the surface shape , and thus requires a separate treatment after it happened ) .",
    "first of all , the amount of liquid remaining in the drop at this moment is of the order of @xmath79 compared to the original volume and hence would not modify our main - order analytical results .",
    "second , as our _ numerical _ calculations show , at touchdown practically all the solute is already in the deposit phase , and the remaining amount of the solute in the liquid phase is insignificant .",
    "thus , within our model , the remainder of the drying process can not modify the deposit ring substantially , and hence this neglect of the late - time regime seems well justified .",
    "experimentally , the inner part of the deposit ring is different from our prediction ( which is a vertical wall ) and appears to have a spread shelf .",
    "presence of this tail in the deposit distribution can be caused by several features absent in our model .",
    "its inherent two - dimensionality may be one of these shortcomings ( as discussed above ) ; the account for the dynamical processes occurring after the deposit phase has already been formed ( _ e.g. _  avalanches of the inner wall ) may be another missing feature .",
    "absence of the account for the late - time regime after the center - point touches the substrate may be among these reasons influencing the final distribution of the deposit as well . a more detailed account for the effects of this late - time regime",
    "might be required in the future .",
    "the major results presented in this work are related to two problems .",
    "one of them is the problem of the solute transfer and the deposit growth in angular evaporating drops , and the other is the problem of determining the geometrical characteristics of the deposition patterns in circular evaporating drops .    for the angular drops , we provide the full solution to the problem of the deposit accumulation at the contact line .",
    "we determine all the necessary physical quantities ( the surface shape , the evaporation rate , the flow field , and the mass of the deposit ) and fully describe the deposition process near the vertex of the angle .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the angular drops are rich in singularities that govern all these physical quantities and affect the deposition .",
    "all the quantities scale as power laws of the distance to the vertex and the elapsed drying time with exponents dependent only on the opening angle of the drop .",
    "these exponents are universal and do not depend on any free or fitting parameters , they depend only on the drop geometry .",
    "this dependence on the geometry is useful for creating controlled deposition patterns and is a step towards complete understanding of the evaporative deposition for arbitrary contact - line geometries .    for the problem on the geometrical characteristics of the deposition patterns , we provide a model that accounts for the finite dimensions of the deposit on the basis of the assumption that the solute particles occupy finite volume and hence these dimensions are of the steric origin .",
    "within this model , we find the analytical solution for small initial concentrations of the solute and the numerical solution for arbitrary initial concentrations of the solute .",
    "we demonstrate the agreement between our results and the experimental data and show that the observed dependence of the deposit dimensions on the experimental parameters ( the initial concentration of the solute , the initial geometry of the drop , and the time elapsed from the beginning of the drying process ) can be attributed mainly to the finite dimensions of the solute particles .",
    "these results are also universal and important for understanding the deposition process and controlling the pattern formation .",
    "the entire work provides all our results and derivations pertaining to the evaporative deposition and obtained to date in a single volume , which may serve as a reference guide to anyone interested in the theory of the evaporative deposition .",
    "we hope this reference volume will simplify future theoretical and experimental efforts towards the complete understanding of these ubiquitous phenomena .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate that for sufficiently slow flows one can employ the equilibrium surface shape for finding the pressure and the velocity fields instead of having to solve for all the dynamical variables simultaneously .",
    "we will also quantify how slow `` sufficiently slow flows '' are .",
    "we start from the equation of the mechanical equilibrium of the interface  ( [ mechequil ] ) , where we approximate the doubled mean curvature @xmath522 with @xmath523 .",
    "this approximation holds true because the liquid - air interface is nearly horizontal for thin drops and small contact angles ( this can be proved rigorously for both geometries of interest , see the corresponding sections in the main text ) , and the other terms of the functional @xmath524 $ ] are unimportant .",
    "substitution of @xmath525 into the darcy s law  ( [ darcy ] ) yields @xmath526 where @xmath17 .",
    "upon further substitution into the conservation of mass  ( [ consmass ] ) , we obtain @xmath527 + \\frac{j}{\\rho } + \\partial_t h = 0 , \\label{consmas1}\\ ] ] which , together with eq .",
    "( [ v - h ] ) , constitutes the full system of equations for finding @xmath56 and @xmath528 .",
    "now , for water under normal conditions , @xmath529 and @xmath530 .",
    "hence , the velocity scale @xmath80 is of the order of @xmath531 obviously , this is a huge value compared to the characteristic velocities encountered in usual drying process .",
    "therefore , one can develop a systematic series expansion in small parameter @xmath532 ( where @xmath20 is some characteristic value of velocity , say , 1 or 10  @xmath1 m/s ) : @xmath533 @xmath534 and keep only the @xmath535 and @xmath536 terms at the end in order to describe the process up to the main order in @xmath532 .",
    "a similar expansion can also be constructed for pressure : @xmath537 where @xmath538 are related to @xmath539 by equation  ( [ p - h ] ) : @xmath540 physically , condition @xmath541 is equivalent to the statement that the viscous stress is negligible and that the capillary forces dominate .",
    "let us understand what @xmath535 and @xmath536 physically correspond to .",
    "plugging the expansions for @xmath49 and @xmath51 into the system  ( [ v - h])([consmas1 ] ) , one obtains a set of terms for each power of @xmath79 , starting from @xmath542 and up .",
    "equating terms of the main order in @xmath79 yields the following two equations @xmath543 = 0,\\ ] ] which both can be satisfied if and only if @xmath544 is a function of time only .",
    "writing it as @xmath545 we immediately identify this equation with the statement of spatial constancy of the mean curvature of the interface , which describes the _ equilibrium _ surface shape at any given moment of time @xmath48 ( _ i.e. _  we obtained equation  ( [ laplace ] ) with the desired properties of @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath535 is indeed the equilibrium surface shape , and so is @xmath49 ( up to the corrections of the order of @xmath546 ) .    repeating the same procedure for the terms of the next order in @xmath79 , we arrive at another two equations : @xmath547 @xmath548 + \\frac{j}{\\rho } + \\partial_t h_0 = 0,\\ ] ] which can be seen to be equivalent to the set of equations  ( [ psi])([vpsi ] ) upon identification @xmath549 . knowing the equilibrium surface shape @xmath535 , one can solve the second equation above with respect to the reduced pressure @xmath81 , and then obtain velocity @xmath536 by differentiating the result according to the first equation .",
    "thus , up to the corrections of the order of @xmath546 , one can first find the equilibrium surface shape @xmath15 at any given moment of time , and then determine the pressure and the flow fields for this fixed functional form of @xmath49 , as was asserted in the main text .",
