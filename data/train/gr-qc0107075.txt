    "nearly four decades ago , it was shown by epstein , glaser and jaffe @xcite that a positive definite energy density was incompatible with the usual postulates of a quantized field theory .",
    "worse yet , it appears that the energy density is not even bounded from below .",
    "thus , all standard quantized field theories are capable of violating all the pointwise and averaged energy conditions in general relativity .",
    "however , this does not mean that the energy density can remain negative for an arbitrarily long period of time .",
    "over the last decade , new forms of energy conditions involving various temporal and spatial averagings have been developed .",
    "one such example is the quantum inequality , which is the weighted temporal average of the energy density along the worldline of an observer .",
    "derived directly from quantum field theory , these inequalities limit the magnitude and temporal duration of existence of negative energy densities .",
    "the quantum inequalities say that if an observer tries to make a measurement of the energy density for some characteristic sampling time @xmath0 , then the maximal negative energy that he might ever measure is bounded below by an inverse power of the characteristic sampling time .",
    "given an observer s four - velocity @xmath1 and a sampling ( weighting ) function @xmath2 of characteristic width @xmath0 , then the quantum inequality is given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a dimensionless constant of order unity and @xmath5 is the dimension of the spacetime .",
    "for a massless field in minkowski spacetime , the function @xmath6 is equal to one and the vacuum energy density vanishes . for massive fields and/or curved spacetimes",
    ", @xmath6 represents the modification of the quantum inequality away from its massless , flat space functional form .",
    "it has the generic behavior that it is approximately one for small @xmath0 , and in most spacetimes it typically decays for longer characteristic sampling times",
    ". however there are some known exceptions , such as four - dimensional de  sitter and rindler spacetimes , where the function @xmath7 only grows only as fast as @xmath8 .",
    "the quantum inequalities were first derived by ford @xcite to constrain negative energy fluxes for the quantized , massless , minimally - coupled scalar field in minkowski spacetime .",
    "these results were then expanded to the energy density of the massive scalar field in minkowski space and in static curved spacetimes @xcite . in all of the these cases , a lorentzian sampling function , @xmath9",
    "was used to simplify the calculations . however , flanagan @xcite showed it was possible to derive optimum quantum inequalities for the massless scalar field in two dimensions for an arbitrary , smooth positive choice of the sampling function .",
    "this was followed by the work of fewster and colleagues who have established the quantum inequality for the minimally coupled scalar field in static curved spacetimes of any dimension with an arbitrary , smooth positive sampling function .",
    "although much of the previous work has been for the scalar field , work is now progressing for higher spin fields .",
    "vollick has shown that an optimum quantum inequality can be derived for the dirac field in two spacetime dimensions @xcite for an arbitrary sampling function using the conformal properties of the field theory .",
    "more recently , fewster and verch have established `` quantum weak energy inequalities '' for the dirac and majorana fields of nonzero mass in four - dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes . making use of microlocal analysis techniques , fewster and collaborators",
    "have vastly extended the applicability of the quantum inequalities to arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "the first quantum inequality for the electromagnetic field was derived by ford and roman for a lorentzian sampling function in flat spacetime .",
    "this was immediately generalized to curved static spacetimes by the author @xcite , although both of these calculations relied on the specific choice of the lorentzian sampling function .",
    "in addition , the proof in both cases was mathematically long and at some times quite complicated , particularly in some of the lemmas required .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that it is possible to derive a generalized quantum inequality for the quantized electromagnetic field in static curved spacetimes with a length element of the form @xmath10 the proof presented here is greatly simplified , in large part due to generalization of a more direct positivity lemma originally developed by fewster and colleagues .",
    "in addition , the electromagnetic field quantum inequality is proven for an arbitrary choice of sampling function so long as it be a positive , continuous function of unit area that decays at infinity .",
    "the end result of our calculations is the quantum inequality written as a mode function expansion , @xmath11 \\right|^2 \\left[{1\\over |g_{00}| }   \\overline{e_i(\\lambda,{\\bf k};{\\bf x})}\\ ; g^{ij } \\ ; e_j(\\lambda,{\\bf k};{\\bf   x } ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad+\\left.\\left|{g_{00}\\over g}\\right| \\overline{b_i(\\lambda,{\\bf   k } ; { \\bf x})}\\ ; ( g^{ij})^{-1 } \\ ;",

    "the case for the scalar field , the electromagnetic field quantum inequality ( [ eq : em_quant_ineq ] ) tells us how much negative energy an observer may measure relative to the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field .    in section  [ sec :",
    "we will discuss the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in curved space and elucidate the particle state structure and the form of the stress - tensor .",
    "in particular , two different forms of quantization will be discussed : direct quantization in the classical coulomb gauge and the more elegant gupta - bleuler form of quantization . in section  [ sec : positivity ] we develop the positivity lemma for generic inner - products of vector fields , which is a generalization of work developed by fewster and colleagues for the scalar field . in section",
    "[ sec : the_qi ] we lay out the remainder of the proof of the quantum inequality , finally arriving at the expression above .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : examples ] we will look at the resulting quantum inequalities for minkowski spacetime , rindler spacetime and the einstein closed universe .    we will follow the the convention of wald @xcite where the signature of the metric is @xmath17 .",
    "greek indices are summed over ( 0,1,2,3 ) while latin indices denote the spatial components ( 1,2,3 ) .",
    "however , the letter @xmath15 has been singled out as the polarization state label , and depending on the context , can represent either the two physical polarization states 1 and 2 , or the full set of polarization states 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 in the gupta - bleuler formalism which includes the scalar and axial photon polarization states .",
    "also , the complex conjugate of @xmath18 , will be denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "units of @xmath20 will be used throughout .",
    "we begin our discussion of the electromagnetic field by defining the classical maxwell action for a source free field in curved space , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the antisymmetric field - strength tensor related to the four - vector potential , @xmath23 , by @xmath24 here @xmath25 represents covariant differentiation .    varying the maxwell action with respect to the vector potential and setting the variation equal to zero leads to the source free inhomogeneous maxwell equation for the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime , @xmath26 due to the bianchi identities",
    ", the electromagnetic field also satisfies the subsidiary condition , @xmath27 } = 0\\ , , \\label{eq : max_homo}\\ ] ] which is the homogeneous maxwell equation .",
    "the combined set of equations represents classical electrodynamics written in covariant form .",
    "if we insert the four - vector potential into both expressions , it is found that the homogeneous maxwell equation  ( [ eq : max_homo ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "the inhomogeneous equation ( [ eq : max_inhomo ] ) yields the second order wave equation @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the ricci tensor which arises due to the commutation relation for the covariant derivatives acting on a vector field .",
    "the stress - tensor for the classical electromagnetic field is found by varying the maxwell action with respect to the spacetime metric . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath30    the field - strength tensor , the maxwell equations and the stress tensor are invariant under the gauge freedom @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary scalar function . in classical electromagnetism",
    ", the correct choice of gauge can often simplify finding the solution to the field equations .",
    "in many cases , it is convenient to choose the lorentz gauge condition @xmath33 which immediately removes the middle term in the wave equation ( [ eq : wave_eq ] ) .",
    "this can always be achieved by choosing @xmath34 to satisfy @xmath35 it should be noted that there is still a restricted gauge freedom remaining in that we can still add to the vector potential any function that satisfies the homogeneous equation @xmath36 as we shall see below , this restricted gauge freedom will be used to impose the coulomb gauge .",
    "it should be noted that we will drop the identifiers of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in all further calculations    there is some difficulty is directly quantizing electrodynamics in the form so far described .",
    "if one does not specify a gauge , then any four - vector wave equation like ( [ eq : wave_eq ] ) will in general have four orthonormal solutions ( polarization states ) , @xmath39 where @xmath40 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 . in minkowski spacetime",
    "the @xmath41 solution is typically the scalar photon polarization , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the two transverse photon polarizations , and @xmath44 is the axial photon polarization . in curved spacetime",
    "the `` perfect '' separation of the modes into these three `` distinct '' types is not always possible , but we will continue to use the flat space nomenclature . it is found that for one of the polarizations , say @xmath45 , there does not exist a conjugate momenta when the hamiltonian is calculated .",
    "this is a long known problem in flat spacetime electrodynamics and there are several known approaches which have been developed to quantize the electromagnetic field that can be generalized to curved spacetime .",
    "the simplest is to work in a specific gauge @xcite .",
    "a more elegant possibility is to use the gupta - bleuler @xcite formalism of indefinite metrics on the hilbert space of states .",
    "both of these forms of quantization are discussed below .",
    "this is probably the simplest and most direct method of quantizing the electromagnetic field .",
    "the problem so far stems from the fact that the vector potential has four polarization states , while it is known that the photons of the free field theory only come in two different polarizations .",
    "thus , before the theory is quantized we would like to remove the two superfluous polarizations at the classical level . to do this",
    "we require that solutions to the wave equation  ( [ eq : wave_eq ] ) also satisfy the lorentz gauge condition @xmath46 this removes one degree of freedom between the components of the vector potential .",
    "the next condition that we would like to require is that the time component of the four - vector potential vanish in some frame . to accomplish this we let @xmath47 be a timelike vector field .",
    "then we require that @xmath48 satisfy the additional condition @xmath49 it is this second condition that can be ensured by the homogeneous part of the gauge freedom . also , note that is",
    "is not true that the coulomb gauge is noncovariant as is sometimes stated .    in flat spacetime",
    "there is no preferred choice of @xmath47 , however for the static metric of the form ( [ eq : metric ] ) , a natural choice is to let @xmath47 to be the global timelike killing vector field",
    ". this will be the same killing vector that will be used to define the positive frequency mode functions .",
    "since @xmath50 , the net effect is to set the @xmath51-component of the stress tensor equal to zero .",
    "this solves two problems simultaneously .",
    "first it removes @xmath51 from the action , thus there is no longer a problem of it not having a conjugate momenta .",
    "secondly , it has reduced the physical degrees of freedom of the solution to the two physically realizable photon states .",
    "canonical quantization is now straightforward .",
    "the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) possesses a timelike killing vector , which allows us to write the the positive frequency mode function solutions of the wave equation  ( [ eq : wave_eq ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mode label for the propagation vector , @xmath15 is the polarization state and @xmath54 .",
    "the four - vector functions , @xmath55 , are the spatial portion of the solution of the wave equation and carry all the information about the curvature of the spacetime .",
    "in addition they satisfy @xmath56 the mode functions for the vector potential are normalized such that @xmath57 = \\delta^{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta^3({\\bf k } - { \\bf k } ' ) , \\label{eq : coulomb_norm}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a three - volume element in the cauchy surface @xmath59 with unit normal @xmath60 , thus each mode contributes @xmath61 to the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor before renormalization . the general solution to the vector potential",
    "can then be expanded as @xmath62 here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the creation and annihilation operators for the photon which obey the commutation relations @xmath65 } = 0 = { \\big [ } a_{\\lambda}^\\dagger({\\bf k}),a_{\\lambda'}^\\dagger({\\bf k}'){\\big ] } \\ ] ] and @xmath66}= \\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda ' } \\delta({\\bf k } - { \\bf k}').\\ ] ]    the fock representation of the number states can now be constructed from the vacuum state denoted by @xmath67 where the first slot is for particles of polarization type 1 and the second slot is for polarization type 2 .",
    "the vacuum state has the property @xmath68 one - particle states are obtained by acting on the vacuum with the creation operator , @xmath69 are all distinct .",
    "the above state contains @xmath70 total particles where @xmath71 of them are of momentum @xmath72 and polarization 1 , @xmath73 are of momentum @xmath72 and polarization 2 , etc .",
    "effectively , the general number states are a direct product of elements from two different hilbert spaces , one for each of the polarization states . in order to reduce the index notation to a more manageable form ,",
    "define the two vectors @xmath74 then the states can be written more simply as @xmath75 .",
    "the most general state that can then be written as a linear superposition of all the possible number states , @xmath76 where @xmath77 are complex coefficients and the sum is assumed to range over all the allowed vectors of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for the state to be properly normalized , the @xmath77 s must satisfy @xmath80      a more elegant form of quantization is to use the gupta - bleuler method of imposing an indefinite metric on the hilbert space of allowable states .",
    "we begin by forming the gupta action , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the maxwell action given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell_action ] ) , and the gauge breaking action is given by @xmath83 variation of the new action with respect to @xmath84 yields the wave equation , @xmath85 which can be rewritten in terms of @xmath48 as @xmath86 this would correspond to maxwell s equations if the field also satisfied the lorentz gauge condition .",
    "there are four possible solutions ( polarizations ) to the above wave equation .",
    "first , there are the two physical polarizations which are labeled with @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "these two polarizations satisfy the wave equation  ( [ eq : gupta_we ] ) and the lorentz condition , @xmath87 thus , these two polarizations correspond to the two standard solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "the remaining two unphysical polarizations , labeled with @xmath41 or @xmath88 , also satisfy the wave equation  ( [ eq : gupta_we ] ) , but not necessarily the lorentz condition .",
    "for ultra - static spacetimes , where @xmath89 , the most natural choice is to use the scalar photon polarization , @xmath90 and the longitudinal photon polarization , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the solution to the massless , minimally couples scalar wave equation , @xmath93 in the more general case of a static spacetime , it is useful to choose the two orthogonal modes which satisfy the condition , @xmath94 in both cases , the resulting modes then satisfy @xmath95 and @xmath96 for every momenta @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , if we define the generalized conjugate momenta , @xmath98 then the modes are required to be orthogonal and normalized by @xmath99 = \\eta^{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta^3({\\bf k } - { \\bf k } ' ) , \\label{eq : gupta_normalize}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a three - volume element in the cauchy surface @xmath59 with unit normal @xmath60 , and @xmath100 diag(-1,1,1,1 ) . the general solution to @xmath101 then has the fourier mode - decomposition @xmath102",
    "if we wish to canonically quantize the field @xmath101 , we impose the equal - time commutation relations @xmath103 = 0 = \\left [ \\pi^{t\\mu}({\\bf x},t ) , \\pi^{t\\nu}({\\bf x}',t)\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath104 = { i { \\delta_\\mu}^\\nu \\over\\sqrt{-g}}\\delta^3({\\bf x } - { \\bf x}').\\ ] ] using the mode decomposition and the normalization condition , we find that the above equal - time commutation relations are equivalent to @xmath105 = \\eta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta^3({\\bf k } - { \\bf k}'),\\ ] ] with all other commutators vanishing .",
    "the state structure is similar in form to that found for the coulomb gauge , except there are now a greater number of allowable states due to the two unphysical unphysical polarizations .",
    "we now define the vacuum state as @xmath106 where the first slot is for photons of the unphysical polarization @xmath41 , the second and third slots are for the two real photon polarizations , and the final slot is for the unphysical polarization with @xmath44 .",
    "the vacuum state vanishes if any of the four destruction operators act on it , and multi - particle states are again obtained by the repeated application of the creation operators . unlike , the states for the coulomb gauge quantization , the states of the gupta - bleuler formalism have indefinite norm , @xmath107 where we have added two new vectors , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , for the unphysical photon polarization states .",
