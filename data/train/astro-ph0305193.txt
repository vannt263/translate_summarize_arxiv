    "primordial perturbations from inflation currently provide our only complete model for the generation of structure in the universe .",
    "it is commonly stated that a generic prediction of inflationary models is a scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations , characterized by a scalar spectral index @xmath0 that obeys @xmath5 .",
    "however , this statement is only true for very special spacetimes like a pure de sitter spacetime , which does not describe our cosmological history . for nearly all realistic inflationary models ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 will vary with the wave - number @xmath1 .",
    "typically , since @xmath6 on the scales probed by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the deviations from a constant @xmath0 must be small . nevertheless , increasingly accurate cosmological observations provide information about the scalar spectral index on scales below those accessible to anisotropy measurements of the cmb .",
    "over such a wide range of scales , it is entirely possible that @xmath0 will exhibit significant _ running _ ; a value that depends on the scale on which it is measured .",
    "such running is quantified by the derivative @xmath7 and , in fact , recently released data  @xcite from the wmap satellite indicates that @xmath8 furthermore , as pointed out by the wmap analysis of @xcite , there is some indication that the spectral index quantity @xmath9 runs from positive values on long length scales to negative values on short length scales ( positive to negative within about 5 e - folds ) .",
    "one must bear in mind that the wmap analysis of @xmath7 may require modification @xcite and that the statistical significance of this result is questionable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the necessary reionization history may be in conflict with large running @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , since a running as large as the central value of eq.([wmap ] ) is not inconsistent with the present data , and since it is difficult to produce in common realizations of inflation , it is worthwhile exploring what such observational data would imply for inflationary models .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the extent to which a scalar spectral index that runs significantly negatively can be accommodated within inflationary models , within the first order slow - roll approximation  .",
    "one generic result of our investigation is that within the slow - roll approximation , there must be an approximate local minimum in the slow roll parameter @xmath10 ( which measures the slope of the potential ) if the spectral index is to run from @xmath2 ( blue ) on long length scales to @xmath3 ( red ) on short length scales .",
    "hence , if observational evidence continues to show @xmath11 running from positive to negative , one can infer that the inflaton potential naturally has a locally flat part in the field values of observational interest .",
    "furthermore , the fact that @xmath7 is large in this same field range and the fact that this large value can not be sustained for many e - folds ( since inflation will then end too quickly ) together indicate that there must be a flat `` bump''-like structure in the potential .",
    "unless the bumps have some kind of singular structure , as we will further explain , they generically lead to @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath11 never changes sign , then a large @xmath7 can be accommodated without a bump , even though the initial field value must still be a special point in the potential .",
    "indeed , the existence of such a special feature in the potential must be generic since as we will show , a negative running of the order of eq.([wmap ] ) requires a large third ( field-)derivative while maintaining small first and second derivatives  .",
    "our second major set of results concerns methods to construct potentials with large running and/or potentials in which the scalar index runs from blue on long length scales to red on short length scales .",
    "this task is generically nontrivial due to the difficulty of achieving around 60 e - foldings of inflation after attaining a large @xmath7 .",
    "we develop two formalisms to generate such viable inflationary potentials . through one of our formalisms",
    "we show that having a blue spectrum on long length scales generically helps to achieve a large number of e - foldings after having attained a large @xmath7 . in this sense , having a blue spectrum with large @xmath7 is not as `` singular '' as having a red spectrum with large @xmath7 .    the first method of construction , which we will call the singular method for reasons that will become apparent ( although there need not be any true singularities ) , is suitable for generating arbitrarily large @xmath7 without upsetting slow - roll",
    "however , this method of construction does not give rise to a change in the sign of @xmath9 within about 5 efolds nor does it yield a blue spectrum on large scales .",
    "the second method of construction , which we will call the index method , gives the potential as a functional of any reasonable ansatz for @xmath13 .",
    "this index method is generic , covering virtually all slow roll models that have a blue spectrum on large length scales . within this formalism",
    ", we can easily construct models in which @xmath11 goes from blue to red .",
    "this method may also be combined with other formalisms .",
    "in the appendix , we survey a variety of inflationary models in the literature and show how strongly the spectral index can run in each case",
    ". the survey will allow the reader to gain intuition about the difficulty in achieving strong running of the spectral index as well as the difficulty in having a spectrum whose index runs from blue to red .",
    "although there have been several recent works concerned with the construction of potentials that have the strong running properties that we are concerned with @xcite , for practical reasons we have reviewed only @xcite .",
    "we apologize to the other authors whose work we do not review in the appendix .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we establish our notation and list the well - known constraints on inflationary models .",
    "in particular , we show that a large third derivative of the inflaton potential is required to generate a large running of the spectral index . in section  [ sec :",
    "canonrecipe ] , we develop our first simple formalism , the singular method , to generate potentials with large running of the spectral index . in the section that follows ( section  [ sec : canonexamples ] ) , we employ our formalism to obtain some models of inflation with large running .",
    "complementing these sections on the singular method is section  [ sec : normalization ] , where we show how nonminimal kinetic terms can aid in making the construction look more natural . in section",
    "[ sec : functional ] , we introduce the index method by deriving an expression for the potential as a functional of any reasonable spectral index function and in section  [ sec : bluetored ] we use this functional to generate potentials which give running from blue to red . in section  [ sec : newconsistency ] , we discuss the result that @xmath10 generically has an approximate local minimum near the point at which @xmath11 changes sign .",
    "finally we summarize and offer our conclusions .",
    "following garriga and mukhanov @xcite , let us consider the most general local action for a scalar field coupled to einstein gravity , which involves at most first derivatives of the field , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ricci scalar and @xmath16 the lagrangian density for the scalar field is denoted by @xmath17 because it plays the role of pressure @xcite in cosmological applications .",
    "this action reduces to the usual inflationary model with canonical kinetic term when @xmath18 , but it also describes the more general case in which the kinetic term is non - canonical . for completeness , we will derive the properties of the power spectrum for the general form of @xmath19 and apply our results to some special cases .    for an action of the form in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , the energy density is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes partial derivative of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the `` sound speed '' @xmath23 is then @xmath24 and the power spectrum for the scalar fluctuations is @xcite @xmath25    the spectral index for the scalar mode is given by  @xcite @xmath26   - \\frac{1}{h } \\frac{d}{dt } \\left ( \\ln c_s \\right ) + \\dots \\ , \\ ] ] where the quantities on the right - handed side are evaluated at horizon crossing .",
    "here , we keep only terms that are lowest order in the slow - roll parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this allows us to derive an expression for the main quantity of interest to us , the running spectral index @xmath29 - \\frac{1}{h^2 } \\frac{d^2}{dt^2 } \\left ( \\ln c_s \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{h}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}\\left [ \\ln \\left(1 +   \\frac{p}{\\cal e } \\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right)-\\frac{1}{h}\\left[\\frac{d}{dt}\\left ( \\ln c_s \\right)\\right]\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , it is also useful to note that the ratio of the tensor fluctuations @xmath30 to the scalar fluctuations @xmath31 @xcite is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the tensor spectral index . in principle",
    ", the consistency condition @xmath34 can be violated for models with non - canonical terms , since @xmath23 can differ from unity @xcite .",
    "let us first apply the above general formulae to the standard case of slow - roll inflation . in this case",

    "inflation occurs if @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , we define a third parameter related to the third derivative of the potential @xmath45 which is important for the running of the spectral index .    in terms of the slow - roll parameterization ,",
    "the power spectrum becomes @xmath46 to leading order .",
    "we also recover the well - known expressions for the spectral index @xmath47 its derivative @xmath48 and expression in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath49      let us now consider a second interesting special case , in which @xmath19 takes the following form @xmath50 where the potential @xmath51 and the function @xmath52 are general functions .",
    "this form of @xmath19 can arise , for example , from quantum corrections to the kinetic term , which yield @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is a constant , and @xmath55 is a coupling constant ) .",
    "a similar action arises in brane inflationary models @xcite due to a velocity - dependent potential between d - branes .",
    "finally , note that this form of the nonminimal kinetic term can always be brought back to the canonical form ( at least over a finite field region ) by an appropriate field redefinition , as we will discuss in detail later .",
    "the energy density is @xmath56 and , since @xmath57 in this case , the slow - roll parameters depend only on @xmath58 , given by @xmath59    to determine the classical background of @xmath22 , let us consider the equation of motion for @xmath39 @xmath60 for slow - roll inflation , @xmath61 and the potential energy dominates .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that @xmath62 and therefore  @xcite @xmath63 hence , the classical background value of @xmath22 is @xmath64 where @xmath10 is the slow - roll parameter defined previously .",

    "\\label{eq : runningslownoncanon}\\ ] ] again , we neglect terms higher order in the slow - roll parameters .",
    "we also assume that the counting of the number of derivatives gives an estimate of the order of the parameters . this need not be the case , and some counterexamples have been found @xcite .      for completeness ,",
    "let us mention another form of @xmath19 ; the so - called k - essence form  @xcite @xmath73 the tachyon action considered in @xcite is also of this form .",
    "the pressure and energy density are @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , the function @xmath51 does not enter the expressions for @xmath11 or @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , in such models , the constraint from large running becomes a criterion to be satisfied by the form of the `` kinetic term '' @xmath77 .      for inflationary predictions",

    ", at least classically , we are free to adjust the height of the inflaton potential .",

    "most of our analysis we will simply take @xmath91 to be somewhere between 50 and 60 without worrying about the details of reheating .",
    "note that @xmath92 , so that the magnitude of @xmath93 decreases with increasing @xmath94 .",
    "this means that , in general , the magnitude of @xmath7 is increased by minimizing @xmath90 , which is achieved by low scale inflationary models .",
    "hence , lowering the reheating temperature and the scale of the inflaton potential generically lead to stronger running of the spectral index .",
    "for example , if @xmath95 and @xmath96 mev then we require @xmath97 which contributes a factor @xmath98 to @xmath7 , rather than @xmath99 in the typical high - scale models .",
    "however , it is difficult to achieve a successful inflation scenario at such a low energy scale ( see , for example  @xcite ) .      in order to achieve negative running of the order of the central value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : largerunningobs ] ) , the running must be dominated by the @xmath100-term ( the third derivative term ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xidefine ] ) in the canonically normalized inflaton basis .    to see this ,",
    "suppose @xmath7 is dominated by terms other than the @xmath100-term .",
    "then , using  ( [ eq : nsmin1slowcanon ] ) and  ( [ eq : runningslowcanon ] ) , we obtain @xmath101 for this to be sufficiently negative , we must have @xmath102 since the right hand side of this inequality is minimized at @xmath103 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : impossibineq ] ) forces @xmath104 , which is ruled out at around the 5@xmath78 level by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsmin1obs ] ) .",
    "hence , in order to attain the requisite running the @xmath100 term must dominate .    in the case of a nonminimal kinetic term ( but still with two derivatives ) , we appear to have extra freedom to adjust @xmath7 by changing @xmath105 and @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : runningslownoncanon ] ) .",
    "however , this freedom in adjusting the cancellation should just correspond to adjusting the third derivative term @xmath100 after canonically normalizing .",
    "the nonminimal kinetic models hence must be seen as a convenient way obtaining a large third derivative in those situations in which the field redefinition to a canonical basis is possible .",
    "we saw in the last section that to obtain a large @xmath107 , one must maximize the third derivative @xmath108 while minimizing @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this section",
    "we describe a recipe for constructing an inflaton potential with these properties .",
    "we begin by considering a singular limit of what is required , one in which @xmath108 diverges while @xmath109 and @xmath110 remain regular .",
    "it is convenient to define a new function @xmath111 by @xmath112 in terms of which @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 is evaluated at around @xmath116 e - foldings before the end of inflation , corresponding to the field value @xmath117 .",
    "we require @xmath118 and @xmath119 to be regular at @xmath120 , but @xmath121 to be singular there .",
    "note that it is _ insufficient _ merely to choose a function for which @xmath122 diverges , since the product @xmath123 may be regular even though @xmath124 is irregular .    to construct a suitable @xmath125",
    "define @xmath126 by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a sign .",
    "our condition on @xmath125 then implies that @xmath129 must satisfy @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 therefore we require a @xmath133 function @xmath134 , for which @xmath135 is discontinuous at @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility of @xmath138 , it is difficult to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : keycond ] ) in such cases .",
    "the slow - roll parameters can be written in terms of @xmath139 as @xmath140 @xmath141 and the corresponding observables are @xmath142 @xmath143 note that the observables take on a much simpler form in terms of @xmath139 compared to the expression in terms of @xmath125 .",
    "additionally , these expressions do not contain large numbers compared to when they are expressed in terms of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "one of the main challenges in obtaining strong running is now clear ; because @xmath144 is small , we must choose @xmath139 to be small , but choosing @xmath146 too small unacceptably increases @xmath147 .",
    "further , in order to have inflation at all we must ensure that slow - roll is valid throughout inflation .",
    "in other words , the direction in which @xmath115 rolls is the same direction in which @xmath144 increases .",
    "this implies that @xmath148=-\\textrm{sign}[v'(\\phi _ { * } ) ] \\ , \\ ] ] although , strictly speaking , this condition need not hold if there are unusual features (  bumps \" ) in the potential .",

    "having dealt with an idealized singular limit , recall now that we do not want @xmath151 to actually diverge at @xmath136 .",
    "we therefore regularize ( smooth out ) @xmath152 .",
    "one may accomplish this either by adding small terms to remove the singularity , or by arranging that the inflaton never quite reaches @xmath117 .",
    "let us now restate the findings of this section as a simple recipe .    1 .",

    ", we also explore the extent to which the constraints on the inflaton potential can be relaxed if the kinetic term of the inflaton is non - canonical .",
    "we found that we have extra freedom in adjusting a large running while maintaining a small @xmath11 because of the new contributions from the field - dependent kinetic term .",
