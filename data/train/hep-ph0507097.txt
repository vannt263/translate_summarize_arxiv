    "the breaking of symmetries is one of the most important issues in particle physics .",
    "nature has taught us the relevance of symmetry principles , especially through noether s connection of global symmetries with conservation laws and the successful description of fundamental interactions via local gauge invariance . but to reconcile symmetric field equations with the real world , one needs that some of the solutions to those equations have a reduced symmetry compared to the equations themselves .",
    "this is , of course , what we mean by ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) ' or ` hidden symmetry ' .    the precise mechanism by which electroweak ssb happens has yet to be experimentally determined . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the default option is to use an elementary scalar or higgs field doublet with a quartic potential that induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value for one of the components .",
    "this will soon be tested at the large hadron collider through its physical - higgs boson search programme .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further develop a different method of symmetry breaking called the ` clash of symmetries ' @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism is relevant for brane - world extensions to the regular @xmath7 dimensional standard model @xcite .",
    "the important development we report here is the rigorous incorporation of gravity into one of the toy higgs models explored in the previous papers on this topic @xcite .",
    "since gravity is fundamental to brane - world models , this is a very welcome step forward .",
    "the toy model we shall analyse consists of two complex scalar fields @xmath0 coupled to @xmath3 dimensional gravity endowed with a bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the action is constructed to be invariant under global u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) transformations and the discrete @xmath2 interchange operation .",
    "the higgs potential we construct is sextic , and its specific form is driven by our desire to find an analytic solution to the coupled einstein - higgs field equations .",
    "the spacetime metric tensor we posit has the randall - sundrum non - factorisable form @xcite , but with the warp factor a completely smooth function of the extra dimension coordinate .",
    "the precise randall - sundrum metric emerges by taking a certain limit .",
    "the higgs field configurations we seek are kink - like , associated with the spontaneously broken discrete symmetry .",
    "we also study the gauged version of this model , extending the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "we find additional non - trivial flat - space solutions , but despite an extensive numerical search we have been unable to find any warped metric solutions with nonzero gauge fields .",
    "section [ clashreview ] reviews the clash of symmetries mechanism , while sec .",
    "[ model_ungauged ] defines and analyses the ungauged version of our toy model .",
    "this is followed by an account of the gauged cases in sec .",
    "[ model_gauged ] .",
    "the final section is a conclusion and outlook for future work .",
    "the default ssb mechanism employed in the sm and many extensions to it utilises a simple spatially homogeneous , static and stable solution to the field equations : the higgs fields @xmath8 are set equal to those constant values corresponding to an absolute minimum of the higgs potential .",
    "the locations of the nonzero constants within the higgs multiplets then determine the stability group of the vacuum state , what we commonly call the unbroken symmetry after ssb .",
    "the nonzero higgs fields become constant background scalar fields throughout the universe .",
    "there are other types of solutions to higgs field equations that can also serve as stable , static background fields : topological solitons , such as kinks , strings and monopoles .",
    "while there is much interest in such configurations , they are not usually considered as viable candidates for playing a major role in spontaneous symmetry breaking . this is simply because they are spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "the energy densities required for electroweak and higher symmetry breaking are so high as to be incompatible with the strong evidence for a universe that is spatially homogeneous at large scales .",
    "this objection , however , does not apply to brane - world models , because the non - trivial spatial dependence can be restricted to the extra dimension coordinates only .    for definiteness ,",
    "consider the case of one extra dimension described by cartesian coordinate @xmath4 and topologically - stable higgs configurations @xmath9 , some of which have kink - form with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the pattern of spontaneous breaking then effectively becomes a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath7-brane is located at , say , @xmath10 . if the degrees of freedom that are confined to the brane @xcite are confined absolutely , then the unbroken symmetry is the stability group of @xmath11 , to be denoted by @xmath12 from now on ( and let the internal symmetry group of the action be @xmath13 ) .",
    "the symmetry breaking will be communicated to the brane - world denizens through appropriate interactions .",
    "but in a quantal ( and perhaps even in a classical ) world , one would not expect strict confinement to the brane : there should be some leakage off it into the bulk .",
    "one therefore expects the brane - localised fields to also couple , but with reduced strength , to @xmath9 states where @xmath4 is slightly different from zero .",
    "if the stability group of @xmath14 , call it @xmath15 , is different from @xmath12 , then a rather rich effective symmetry breaking outcome could ensue for the brane world .",
    "for example , a hierarchical breaking pattern @xmath16 was speculated upon in ref.@xcite , where in that case @xmath17so(10 ) , @xmath18su(4)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) and @xmath19su(3)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1)@xmath20 . the potential application to grand unified models and",
    "the gauge hierarchy puzzle is clear .",
    "the ` clash of symmetries ' phenomenon allows the unbroken symmetry at non - asymptotic points in the extra dimension , @xmath21 , to be smaller than the symmetry holding at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity for kink configurations are set to be the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "they force the spontaneous breaking @xmath23 . in usual ssb",
    ", the higgs vev configuration is used throughout the whole of space , so the symmetry is broken to the group we are calling @xmath24 everywhere , homogeneously . in the clash of symmetries mechanism , this symmetry breaking pattern only holds asymptotically with respect to the extra dimension(s ) .    the clash of symmetries can occur if the isomorphic subgroups left unbroken at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , can be _ differently embedded _ within the parent group @xmath13 . in the cases examined so far in the literature ,",
    "the breakdown at finite values of @xmath4 is to the _ intersection _ of the asymptotic stability groups , @xmath29 although @xmath30 and @xmath31 are isomorphic , their different embeddings within @xmath13 leads their intersection to be a smaller group .",
    "some special values of @xmath4 , most often @xmath10 , may correspond to stability groups larger than @xmath32 because the spatially varying higgs configurations may instantaneously pass through special patterns as @xmath4 varies .",
    "for instance , a component of a higgs multiplet may be an odd function of @xmath4 such as @xmath33 , so it would vanish at @xmath10 and thus the unbroken symmetry would be enhanced at that point .",
    "this possibility lies behind our remarks two paragraphs above about an application to the gauge hierarchy problem",
    ".    discrete symmetries also play a vital role : their spontaneous breakdown leads the vacuum manifold to have disconnected pieces",
    ". kinks interpolate between vacuum states from disconnected pieces . within a given topological class of kinks , the one with lowest energy",
    "is then guaranteed to be ( topologically ) stable .",
    "the easiest example of the clash of symmetries uses @xmath34su(3 ) spontaneously breaking to su(2 ) .",
    "an su(2 ) subgroup can be embedded in three different ways in su(3 ) : @xmath35-spin , @xmath36-spin and @xmath37-spin .",
    "clash of symmetries kinks interpolate between vevs respecting @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "the differently embedded asymptotic su(2 ) symmetries `` clash '' at non - asymptotic points , leading @xmath32 to be su(2)@xmath42su(2)@xmath43 and so on .",
    "the model - building promise of the clash of symmetries lies in the greater symmetry breaking power of spatially inhomogeneous higgs configurations over the simple homogeneous alternative of standard ssb .",
    "we hope that this will lead to models with simpler higgs sectors and fewer associated parameters .",
    "some of us have already speculated that the ultimate application might be to an @xmath44 model , because of the fact that there are three different @xmath44 generators that can serve as electric charge , corresponding to three different embeddings of electromagnetism within the full group @xcite .",
    "standard @xmath44 models can only use one at a time . even more speculatively",
    ", a connection between that threefold structure and the three families of quarks and leptons might exist @xcite .",
    "but many preparatory studies are needed before such an ambitious vision can be realised . in this paper",
    ", we take another important step along that road : the incorporation of gravity . to facilitate the study of gravity ,",
    "we begin by simplifying the group theoretic structure as much as possible without losing the essence of the clash of symmetries mechanism : we take @xmath17u(1)@xmath45u(1)@xmath46 , with @xmath47u(1)@xmath48 and @xmath49u(1)@xmath46 leading to @xmath50 . the discrete symmetry",
    "we need for topological stability interchanges the two abelian sectors .    in the next section",
    "we show that the ungauged version of this model can yield a clash - of - symmetries - style kink in a warped metric spacetime .",
    "the section after that revisits the gauged extension in both flat and curved spacetime .",

    "a very important topic for the future of the clash of symmetries mechanism will indeed be the rules by which potentials should be specified .",

    "the higgs configurations are the square roots of the most nave choices , and @xmath84 is essentially a regularisation of @xmath85 .",
    "the latter is , of course , the corresponding function in the randall - sundrum scenario .",
