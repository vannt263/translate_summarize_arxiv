    "recent precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite has provided detailed informations about the mechanism of generating the cosmic density fluctuations .",
    "importantly , observed cmb anisotropies are highly consistent with those predicted from scale - invariant purely adiabatic primordial density fluctuations .",
    "such a class of primordial density fluctuations is also consistent with the recent results by the sloan digital sky survey experiments @xcite . among various possibilities ,",
    "inflation is one of the most famous scenarios of generating cosmic density fluctuations consistent with the observations .",
    "another class of scenario of generating the scale - invariant adiabatic density fluctuations , however , exists , which is called the `` curvaton '' scenario @xcite.a similar study of the effect of extra scalar field other than the inflaton , see also @xcite .",
    "( for the recent works on the curvaton scenario , see @xcite . )",
    "if there exists a scalar field @xmath0 ( other than the inflaton ) which acquires primordial fluctuation during the inflation , dominant part of the cosmological density fluctuations may originate from the primordial fluctuation of this scalar field .",
    "( the scalar field @xmath0 is called the curvaton . ) importantly , this scenario works irrespective of the detailed properties of the curvaton field , i.e. , its mass , lifetime , and initial amplitude .",
    "consequently , there are many possible and well - motivated candidates of the curvaton field since , in various scenarios of particle cosmology , many scalar - field condensations which once dominate the universe show up ; if those scalars acquire primordial quantum fluctuations , they may play the role of the curvaton .",
    "thus , the curvaton scenario naturally fits into various scenarios of particle cosmology .",
    "in addition , with the curvaton scenario , we have a chance to test the properties of the particle responsible for the cosmological density fluctuations by collider experiments ; this is the case if the flat direction of a minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) becomes the curvaton , for example .",
    "( remember that it is difficult to construct a model of inflation within the framework of the standard model or the mssm.in the mssm , however , it may be possible to use the @xmath1-flat direction consisting of the up - type squarks as well as the up - type higgs boson as the inflaton .",
    "for details , see @xcite . )",
    "an important aspect of the curvaton scenario is that the universe is reheated by the decay of the curvaton . in some case , reheating temperature at the curvaton decay becomes relatively low and hence it is non - trivial if a viable scenario of baryogenesis can be found .",
    "in addition , a large amount of entropy is produced at the time of the decay of the curvaton . as a result ,",
    "even if non - vanishing baryon asymmetry is generated before the decay of the curvaton , primordial baryon asymmetry may be too much diluted to be consistent with the present value .",
    "this may be a problem for the case where , for example , the cosmological moduli fields play the role of the curvaton .",
    "one of the possibilities to generate enough baryon asymmetry with large entropy production is to adopt the affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , it was pointed out that the resultant baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the number densities of the baryon and photon , respectively ) can be as large as the presently observed value @xmath5 even with the large late - time entropy production . in the affleck - dine scenario , however , baryonic isocurvature fluctuation may arise since , in this scenario , baryon asymmetry is generated from a coherent motion of a scalar field ( called affleck - dine field ) . in particular ,",
    "if the affleck - dine mechanism is implemented in the curvaton scenario , correlated baryonic isocurvature fluctuation may arise as we will see below .",
    "thus , it is important to study constraints on this case and see if the curvaton scenario with affleck - dine baryogenesis is viable .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the curvaton scenario with the affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
    "in particular we study the possible baryonic entropy fluctuation generated in this framework and how the entropy fluctuation can be suppressed .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : evolutions ] , we first discuss framework and give the thermal history we consider .",
    "then , we introduce equations by which evolutions of the cosmological density fluctuations are governed . analytic solutions to those equations for a simple ( but well - motivated ) case are also discussed . in section [ sec : numerical ] , we numerically solve the evolution equations . in particular , we will see that the baryonic entropy fluctuation provides very stringent constraints on the curvaton scenarios with affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
    "implications of such constraints for some of the curvaton scenarios are discussed in [ sec : implications ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary of this paper .",
    "let us first introduce the framework . in various models of physics beyond the standard model ,",
    "there are many scalar fields whose potential is approximately parabolic : @xmath6 in the mssm , for example , @xmath7- and @xmath1-flat directions , whose potential is lifted by the supersymmetry - breaking effects , has parabolic potential .",
    "in addition , potential of the cosmological moduli fields are expected to be parabolic when the amplitude of the modulus field is smaller than @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the reduced planck scale ) .",
    "another possible candidates of such a scalar field is pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons @xcite . in this paper , we assume one of such scalar fields plays the role of the curvaton .    here ,",
    "we adopt inflation as a solution to the horizon , flatness , and other cosmological problems .",
    "then , the universe starts with the inflationary epoch where the universe is dominated by the potential energy of the inflaton field @xmath10 ; thermal history before the inflation is irrelevant for our discussion . during the inflation , we assume that the amplitude of the curvaton is non - vanishing .",
    "in addition , we consider the case where the effective mass of the curvaton during the inflation is much smaller than the expansion rate during the inflation @xmath11 .",
    "then , the curvaton acquires the primordial fluctuation during the inflation @xmath12 ( here and hereafter , the subscript `` init '' is used for initial values of the quantities at very early epoch when @xmath0 is slowly rolling . ) after the inflation , universe is reheated by the decay of the inflaton field and the universe is dominated by radiation .",
    "we call this epoch the first radiation - dominated epoch ( or rd1 epoch ) since , in our scenario , there are two radiation - dominated epochs .    as far as the decay of @xmath0 is negligible , universe consists of two components : radiation generated from the decay products of the inflaton , which we denote @xmath13 , and the curvaton .",
    "after the rd1 epoch , evolution of the energy density of @xmath13 obeys the following equation : @xmath14 where the `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to the time @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , ( unperturbed part of ) @xmath0 obeys the following equation : @xmath16 ( as is obvious from the above equations , we have not taken into account of the decay of the curvaton field since the effect of the decay of @xmath0 is negligible for the rd1 and @xmath0-dominated epochs . ) here , @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 being the scale factor ) is the expansion rate of the universe which is given by , when @xmath19 is much larger than the decay rate of @xmath0 , @xmath20    from eq .",
    "( [ dot(rho_r ) ] ) , we can see that @xmath21 . on the contrary ,",
    "the curvaton starts to oscillate when @xmath22 ; after this epoch , energy density of the curvaton decreases as @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the universe can be dominated by the curvaton if the lifetime of the curvaton is long enough .",
    "hereafter , the @xmath0-dominated epoch is called as @xmath0d epoch . after the @xmath0d epoch , the curvaton decays and the universe is reheated again ; we call the second radiation - dominated epoch as rd2 epoch .",
    "after the rd2 epoch , the thermal history is the same as that of the conventional big - bang model ( as far as the zero - mode is concerned ) .    the curvaton amplitude @xmath24 at the time of the `` radiation - curvaton equality '' is easily estimated .",
    "( in the following , the subscript `` eq '' is used for quantities at the time of the radiation - curvaton equality . )",
    "the curvaton starts to oscillate when the temperature of the radiation generated by the inflaton decay ( which is denoted as @xmath13 hereafter ) becomes @xmath25 and , after this epoch , the curvaton amplitude is approximately proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 expansion rate at the equality is also easily estimated : @xmath28    assuming that the energy density of the affleck - dine field is always sub - dominant in the rd1 and @xmath0d epochs , which we assume in this paper , the above discussion holds even with the affleck - dine field .",
    "equation of motion of the affleck - dine field is , on the other hand , given byin our convention , the affleck - dine field @xmath29 is a complex scalar field while the curvaton @xmath0 is a real scalar field .",
    "we assume that the effect of the motion of the curvaton in the phase direction is negligible .",
    "( for the effect of the motion of the curvaton in the phase direction , see @xcite . )",

    "one of the important cases is that the cosmological modulus field plays the role of the curvaton .",
    "the moduli fields in the superstring theory acquire masses from the effects of the supersymmetry breaking and hence their masses are expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass . in addition , their interactions are expected to be suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale @xmath9 and hence , once their amplitudes become smaller than @xmath9 , their potentials are well approximated by the parabolic ones .",
    "thus , if one of such moduli fields has non - vanishing amplitude as well as the primordial fluctuaion , it may play the role of the curvaton .    if the mass of the modulus field ( which is close to the gravitino mass ) is of @xmath135 as in the case of the supergravity - induced supersymmetry breaking , its lifetime becomes much longer than @xmath136 .",
    "with such a long lifetime , decay of the curvaton occurs after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and it spoils the success of the bbn @xcite . if the modulus mass becomes larger than @xmath137 , on the contrary , the cosmological modulus field may decay before the bbn and it may be a viable candidate of the curvaton . in the scenario of the anomaly - mediated supersymmetry",
    "breaking @xcite , for example , this may be the case .",
    "in addition , in the anomaly - mediated models , wino may become the lightest superparticle ; importantly , non - thermally produced winos from the decay of the cosmological modulus field ( i.e. , the curvaton ) can become the cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "in such a model , baryon asymmetry of the universe should be generated with very low reheating temperature and with very large dilution factor ; as a candidate of the scenario of baryogenesis in such a situation , the affleck - dine mechanism has been known to be promising @xcite .",
    "although a sizable hierarchy is possible between @xmath122 and @xmath132 in the anomaly - mediated scenarios , we still obtain remarkable constraint on @xmath59 . even for the case with relatively large hierarchy between @xmath122 and @xmath132 as @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) ,",
    "for example , @xmath59 should be larger than @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) ; otherwise , too large baryonic entropy fluctuation is generated as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappab ] . for the case of the anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "the mass of the affleck - dine field , which is given by the masses of the mssm particles , is suppressed by the loop - induced factor of order @xmath142 compared to the gravitino mass . even in that case , @xmath143 is required in order to suppress the baryonic entropy fluctuations .",
    "in fact , if the curvaton field has an initial amplitude as large as @xmath8 , it becomes non - trivial if the inflaton contribution to the cosmic density fluctuations is negligible .",
    "importance of the inflaton contribution can be seen by comparing the metric perturbations generated from the fluctuations of the inflaton and the curvaton .",
    "the curvaton contribution is given in eq .",
    "( [ psi(rd2 ) ] ) while the inflaton contribution is given by @xmath144_{k = ah},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is the inflaton potential , @xmath146 , and the superscript `` ( inf ) '' is for variables generated from the primordial fluctuation of the inflaton field . if @xmath147 , the curvaton contribution dominates .",
    "the relative size depends on the model of the inflation .    for example , for the case of the chaotic inflation with inflaton potential of the form @xmath148",
    ", we obtain @xmath149_{k = ah_{\\rm inf}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq .",
    "( [ psi(rd2 ) ] ) as an approximation .",
    "( in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psird ] , @xmath150 becomes larger than the value given in eq .",
    "( [ psi(rd2 ) ] ) if the initial amplitude of the curvaton becomes comparable to @xmath9 .",
    "then , the ratio becomes smaller . ) using the fact that the inflaton amplitude is @xmath151 when the cobe scale exits the horizon , @xmath152 becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath130 for @xmath153 even if @xmath103 .",
    "thus , sizable fraction of the cosmological density fluctuation originates from the inflaton fluctuation ; with the chaotic inflation , the inflaton contribution is non - negligible unless there is a large hierarchy between the masses of the curvaton and the affleck - dine field . in other words ,",
    "if we consider the case where @xmath122 is close to @xmath132 , @xmath103 is required and the cosmic density fluctuations may not be dominated by the curvaton contribution .    assuming no correlation between the inflaton and curvaton fields , the cmb angular power spectrum has the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the cmb angular power spectra for the cases where the primordial fluctuations of the curvaton and inflaton dominates , respectively .",
    "as we mentioned , @xmath156 may become comparable to ( or even larger than ) @xmath155 .",
    "since the density fluctuations related to the primordial fluctuation of the inflaton field are adiabatic , constraints on @xmath59 ( for fixed value of @xmath157 ) can be relaxed as far as the scale dependence of the primordial density fluctuation is negligible . on the contrary , however ,",
    "if @xmath152 becomes comparable or larger than @xmath130 , significant amount of the cosmic density fluctuations are generated from the primordial fluctuation of the inflaton . in this case , of course , it becomes difficult to relax the observational constraints on the inflaton potential with the curvaton , which has been one of the important motivation of the curvaton scenario .",
    "of course , the chaotic model is not the only possibility of the inflation and , in other case , inflaton contribution to the total cosmic density fluctuations may become minor even though @xmath143 .",
    "model of the inflation with large @xmath11 and small @xmath158 is considered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the curvaton scenario with affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
    "even with a large entropy production due to the decay of the curvaton field , affleck - dine mechanism may be able to generate large enough baryon asymmetry and hence , for some of the curvaton scenarios , affleck - dine mechanism is a prominent candidate of the scenario of baryogenesis .",
    "we have seen , however , that baryonic entropy fluctuation is induced if the affleck - dine field starts to move in the rd1 epoch . since large baryonic entropy fluctuation is inconsistent with the observation ( in particular , with the results of the wmap )",
    ", this provides constraints on the scenario ; as we have seen , in order to evade the constraint , mass of the curvaton or the initial amplitude of the curvaton should be large enough ( for fixed value of @xmath132 ) .",
    "we have also discussed implications of such constraints on some scenario of the curvaton .",
    "one of the cases where the affleck - dine scenario is preferred is that the cosmological modulus field plays the role of the curvaton ; in such a case , baryon asymmetry should be generated with large amount of entropy production and with very low reheating temperature . assuming the anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking , the ratio @xmath157 is expected to be @xmath159 . with such a ratio",
    ", we have seen that the initial amplitude of the curvaton is constrained to be larger than @xmath8 in order not to generate too large baryonic entropy fluctuation .    _",
