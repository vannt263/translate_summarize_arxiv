    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) happen when dramatic changes in the ground state properties of a quantum system can be induced by a tiny variation of an external parameter @xcite .",
    "this system - specific parameter can be a magnetic field in spin systems @xcite , intensity of a laser beam in cold atom simulators of hubbard - like models @xcite , dopant concentration in high - tc superconductors @xcite , etc .",
    "traditional condensed matter approaches to qpt focus on identification of the order parameter and the pattern of symmetry breaking as well as on studies of two point correlation functions and the excitation gap @xcite . at the critical point of the second order qpt",
    "the correlation length diverges while the gap in the excitation spectrum vanishes .",
    "this is typically described by power - law singularities .",
    "correlation length @xmath0 diverges as @xmath1 , while the excitation gap closes as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the external field driving the transition , @xmath4 marks the quantum critical point , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the critical exponents associated with the universality class of the system .",
    "the exponents are universal in the sense that they do not dependent on the microscopic details of the system .",
    "a somewhat different ways of looking at qpts have recently emerged from quantum information community .",
    "one of them is based on studies of quantum entanglement of spins / atoms / etc . undergoing a qpt @xcite .",
    "another is based on studies of ground state fidelity @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "finally , an extreme approach emerged where the hamiltonian is designed to have a particular many - body state as its ground state @xcite .",
    "we will study ground state fidelity below .",
    "more precisely , ground state fidelity , or simply fidelity , is defined here as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a ground state wave function of a many - body hamiltonian @xmath9 describing the system exposed to an external field @xmath3 , while @xmath10 is a parameter difference .",
    "it provides the most basic probe into the dramatic change of the wave function around the critical point and has the following properties @xmath11 the recent surge in studies of fidelity follows observation that quantum criticality promotes its decay @xcite .",
    "this is easily justified as ground states change rapidly near the critical point to reflect singularities of a qpt .",
    "therefore , one expects that @xmath12 has a minimum at the critical point .",
    "the drop in fidelity encodes not only the position of the critical point , but also universal information about the transition given by the critical exponent @xmath6 .",
    "this has been worked out independently in the `` small system '' @xcite and in the thermodynamic @xcite limits .",
    "broadly speaking the former corresponds to @xmath13 at fixed system size @xmath14 , while the latter corresponds to @xmath15 at small , fixed @xmath10 .    in the `` small system ''",
    "limit we can taylor expand fidelity in @xmath10 @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for the so - called fidelity susceptibility .",
    "the linear term in @xmath10 disappears in the above expansion due to the normalization condition of the ground states whose overlap is taken ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this can be also seen from ( [ fbounds ] ) : a linear in @xmath10 term could make @xmath18 or simply fidelity is symmetric with respect to the @xmath19 transformation .",
    "universal information can be extracted from fidelity susceptibility near the critical point through the scaling : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for system dimensionality .",
    "alternatively , one may look at @xmath17 away from the critical point and study @xmath22 .",
    "more generally , the scaling of fidelity susceptibility is linked to the scaling dimension of the most relevant perturbation @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit one obtains @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a scaling function .",
    "we expect the above scaling result to hold when fidelity per lattice site ( @xmath25 ) is well defined in the thermodynamic limit , physics around the critical point is described by one characteristic scale of length ( correlation length ) given by the critical exponent @xmath6 , and @xmath26 so that non - universal ( system - specific ) corrections to ( [ near_f ] ) are subleading @xcite .    expression ( [ near_f ] ) can be simplified away from the critical point when @xmath27 : @xmath28 unlike ( [ fid_sus ] ) , ( [ near_f ] ) is nonanalytic in @xmath10 near the critical point and the taylor expansion of fidelity in @xmath10 is inapplicable here .",
    "this singularity arises from anomalies associated with the qpt in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "all these results have been obtained in the zero temperature limit that we adopt in this work . even though a consistent theory of fidelity in finite temperatures is still missing ,",
    "several results have already been obtained @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec_intro2 ] describes theoretical approaches used to study fidelity and motivation behind this research . in sec .",
    "[ sec_xymodel ] we focus on fidelity in the xy model showing numerous analytical results .",
    "[ sec_mps ] discusses fidelity of the extended ising model @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ instant_quench ] we illustrate some connection between fidelity and dynamics of a nonequilibrium quench . our findings are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec_con ] .",
    "to start , we mention that the term fidelity is used in various contexts in quantum physics to describe the similarity between two quantum states . therefore , it is important to remember that we use it only to refer to an overlap between two ground states of the same physical system calculated for different values of its external parameters .",
    "one of the seminal results on fidelity was obtained by anderson decades ago @xcite .",
    "he showed on a particular model that fidelity disappears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "similar behavior has been later found in other models and was labeled as the anderson orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "more importantly , orthogonality catastrophe was shown to play a role in numerous condensed matter systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    while being an equilibrium quantity , fidelity shows up in nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum systems .",
    "in particular , one encounters it in the context of nonequilibrium qpts ( see @xcite for reviews on dynamics of qpts ) .",
    "for example , the scaling of density of excited quasiparticles following a quench can be derived using it @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an envelope of nonequilibrium coherence oscillations in a central spin problem encodes fidelity as well @xcite .    in the context of equilibrium qpts ,",
    "fidelity has been proposed as an efficient theoretical probe of quantum criticality ( the so - called fidelity approach ) . to appreciate its simplicity , we compare the fidelity approach to the traditional method of studies of quantum criticality based on analysis of the asymptotic decay of the two point correlation functions .",
    "first , both approaches require the same input : the ground state wave functions .",
    "second , they provide the same information : the location of the critical point and the universal critical exponent @xmath6",
    ". third , the conventional approach is based on the assumption that the two point correlations between spins / atoms / etc .",
    "decay semi - exponentially away from the critical point and in a power law manner at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the transition from semi - exponential to the power - law decay can be tedious to study even with the recent tensor network techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the fidelity approach is arguably a simpler alternative at least as far as numerical calculations are concerned .    on the analytical side , compact and accurate results for fidelity",
    "are scarce .",
    "typically , models are not exactly solvable and so analytical results are out of reach for them . in exactly solvable systems situation",
    "is far from trivial as well .",
    "indeed , in systems like the ising model one is left with a large product of analytically known factors that have only recently been cast into a simple expression : see @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec_xymodel ] .",
    "the situation is much different in some systems where ground states can be exactly expressed through finite rank matrix product states : see @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec_mps ] .",
    "the hamiltonians of these systems , however , are `` engineered '' to have a pre - determined ground state @xcite .",
    "these difficulties motivate various approximate approaches .",
    "first , powerful numerical techniques have been deployed including tensor networks @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite simulations .",
    "these approaches provide crucial insight into models that are not exactly solvable ( e.g. @xcite ) , and shall be especially useful for studies of systems with unknown order parameters , critical points and critical exponents .",
    "second , the fidelity susceptibility approach based on the taylor expansion ( [ fid_sus ] ) has been used .",
    "simplification here comes from factoring out the parameter difference @xmath10 and focusing on fidelity susceptibility that depends on the external field only . despite these simplifications ,",
    "it is typically still a mixed analytical and numerical technique .",
    "this approach is limited to studies of fidelity between very similar ground states whose overlap is close to unity . in particular",
    ", this rules out description of anderson orthogonality catastrophe within this framework .",
    "third , the fidelity per lattice site approach has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is in a sense `` orthogonal '' to the fidelity susceptibility approach as ( i ) it targets overlap between any two ground states : any @xmath10 is considered ; ( ii ) it focuses on the large system limit , i.e. , the opposite of what the fidelity susceptibility approach does ; and ( iii ) fidelity typically departs significantly from unity here .",
    "this approach has been explored mostly numerically so far .",
    "our studies assume two most plausible features of the above two approaches @xcite .",
    "first , the thermodynamic limit from the fidelity per lattice site approach which allows us to study fidelity in systems well approximating the critical ( infinite ) ones .",
    "second , small @xmath10 as in fidelity susceptibility approach allowing for derivation of universal scaling results such as ( [ near_f ] ) and ( [ away_f ] ) .",
    "moreover , combination of the two assumptions allows for derivation of compact analytical results for fidelity in some exactly solvable models : the task presumably impossible otherwise .",

    "it has been proposed that there are two divergent characteristic length scales that have to be taken into account around it : one characterized by the scaling exponent @xmath39 and the other by @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we will study here @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ground state of ( [ xyh ] ) . as depicted in fig .",

    "we note here , however , that in some cases @xmath60 has a logarithmic singularity adding a subleading term to the transformation from summation into integration ( [ fintegral ] ) .",
