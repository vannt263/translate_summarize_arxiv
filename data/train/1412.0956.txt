    "<S> the terminal drift velocity @xmath1 attained by the driven particle is then a nonmonotonic function of the force : upon a gradual increase of @xmath0 , the terminal drift velocity first grows as expected from linear response , reaches a peak value and eventually decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the differential mobility of the driven particle becomes negative for @xmath0 exceeding a certain threshold value . </S>",
    "<S> such a counter - intuitive `` getting more from pushing less ''  @xcite behavior of the differential mobility ( or of the differential conductivity ) has been observed for a variety of physical systems and processes , e.g. for electron transfer in semiconductors at low temperatures  @xcite , hopping processes in disordered media @xcite , transport of electrons in mixtures of atomic gases with reactive collisions  @xcite , far - from - equilibrium quantum spin chains  @xcite , some models of brownian motors  @xcite , soft matter colloidal particles @xcite , different nonequilibrium systems  @xcite , and also for the kinetically constrained models of glass formers  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> _ immobile _ bath particles ( @xmath5 ) , it has been argued that for a tracer subject to an external force and diffusing on an infinite percolation cluster , the drift velocity vanishes for large enough values of the force , and therefore ndm occurs  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> surprisingly enough , it appears that ndm is not a specific feature of a frozen distribution of obstacles but also emerges in dynamical environments undergoing continuous reshuffling due to obstacles random motion ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , very recently , numerical analysis performed in  @xcite at a specific value of the density revealed that ndm could occur in a 2d driven lattice gas for bath particles diffusing slow enough .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the origin of the ndm has been attributed to the nonequilibrium ( called `` frenetic '' ) contributions appearing in the fluctuation - dissipation relation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown earlier in  @xcite , due to its interactions with the environment the tp drives such a crowded system to a nonequilibrium steady - state with a nonhomogeneous obstacles density profile . </S>",
    "<S> however , the `` nonequilibrium '' condition is clearly not the only necessary condition for the ndm to emerge - in simulations in  @xcite this phenomenon is apparent for some range of parameters but it definitely should be absent when the obstacles move sufficiently fast so that the tp sees the environment as a fluid .     </S>",

    "<S> therefore , our theoretical framework unifies existing asymptotic results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic result also allows us to quantify the non - trivial nonmonotonic behavior of the velocity with respect to the force , bringing to the fore the central role of the coupling between density and time scales . </S>",

    "<S> the escape from a trap results from two alternative independent events : the tp steps in the transverse direction ( with rate @xmath28 ) or the obstacle steps away ( with rate @xmath29 , for @xmath7 ) . </S>",

    "<S> , we make use of the decoupling approximation  @xcite for the correlation function of the occupation variables of the form @xmath46 which presumes that the occupation of the site just in front of the tp , and of a site some distance @xmath47 apart of it , become statistically independent . </S>",
    "<S> this approach represents a mean - field - like approximation and its physical motivation relies on the observation that a fluctuation in the occupancy of the sites in the vicinity of the tracer does not affect the dynamics far from the tracer itself . </S>",
    "<S> this decoupling scheme has been previously used in @xcite to derive general equations for the tp velocity in two - dimensional open systems . </S>",

    "<S> following  @xcite , this decoupling approximation can be shown to lead to a closed system for the @xmath40 , which is reported in  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> importantly , this shows that for every density there exists a value of @xmath48 above which ndm can be observed ; this value diverges for both @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in turn , for any value of @xmath51 , there exists a range of density @xmath52 $ ] , for which ndm occurs . when @xmath48 is sufficiently large , the value of @xmath53 can be made explicit using a small density expansion ( see eqs.([vel_lin])-([lin_system ] ) below ) . </S>",
