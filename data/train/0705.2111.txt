    "plasma waves , i.e. , self - consistent spatiotemporal variations of the electron density and electric field in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) channels  @xcite can be used in different semiconductor heterostructure devices .",
    "one of the most important advantages of 2deg systems in comparison with 3deg systems is the possibility to realize situations when the characteristic plasma frequency markedly exceeds the frequency of electron collisions with impurities and phonons .",
    "this is achieved using the selective doping when donors are spatially separated from the 2deg channel , so that the electron density can be rather high , while the electron - impurity interaction is weakened . in 2deg systems with highly conducting electrodes ( gates ) similar to field - effect transistor structures ,",
    "the electron density can be effectively controlled ( in particular , significantly increased ) by the applied voltage .",
    "another attractive feature of the 2deg system is that at realistic parameters the characteristic plasma frequency falls in the terahertz range .",
    "this opens up the prospects of creating novel terahertz devices , for example , sources and detectors of terahertz radiation , frequency multipliers , and so on  @xcite . in recent experiments",
    "@xcite , detection of terahertz radiation in and terahertz emission from transistor - like 2deg systems associated with the resonant excitation of plasma waves were realized ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "results of theoretical studies of plasma phenomena in 2deg systems have been reported in numerous publications . however , nonlinear plasma phenomena in these systems are studied far less extensively . in particular ,",
    "the plasma phenomena associated with hydrodynamic nonlinearities in 2deg transport were considered in refs .",
    "the effect of nonlinearities associated with different contact effects were considered theoretically in refs .",
    "nevertheless , nonlinear properties of 2deg systems can themselves be used in device applications .",
    "this and recent progress in experimental studies of terahertz plasma phenomena stimulate a significant interest in nonlinear plasma effects in different 2deg systems .    in this paper , we study nonlinear plasma phenomena associated with the electrical excitation of plasma waves in 2deg systems using both analytical treatment and numerical modeling .",
    "we consider structures with a 2deg channel supplied with side contacts and a system of highly conducting electrodes ( split gates ) which provides an opportunity to control the 2deg by applying voltage signals .",
    "the structures under consideration are schematically shown in fig .  1",
    ". we use the hydrodynamic model for electron transport along the channel coupled with the 2d poisson equation for self - consistent electric potential in and around the channel .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of nonlinear waves in 2deg systems  @xcite , we take into consideration the 2d nature of the potential distributions .",
    "this allows us to follow the change in nonlinear waves properties with the transition from 2deg systems with the gates very close to the channel to those with rather remote gates when the plasmon spectrum essentially varies .",
    "the effect of the spacing between 2deg and highly conducting gates on the linear plasma properties we studied in many papers beginning with the paper by chaplik .",
    "@xcite ( see , in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite where the role of the gates and contacts on the spectra of linear plasma oscillation were considered ) .    as one might expect and is shown below , the 2deg systems with different plasmon spectra exhibit different behavior for nonlinear plasma waves .",
    "this is akin to the difference in properties of gravity surface waves in shallow and deep water pools  @xcite .",
    "apart from this , in our numerical modeling we focus on electron scattering on impurities and phonons as well as on the 2deg viscosity due to electron - electron collisions .",
    "we consider the hydrodynamic equations ( the navier - stokes equation and the continuity equation ) and the poisson equation in the following form :    @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron hydrodynamic velocity along and sheet density in the 2deg channel , @xmath5 is the electric potential , @xmath6 is the electric potential in the channel ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the donor sheet concentration in the 2deg channel ( or near it ) , @xmath9 is the frequency of the electron scattering on impurities and phonons , @xmath10 is the coefficient of viscosity associated with the electron - electron scattering processes , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron charge and effective mass , respectively , @xmath13 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath14 is the dirac delta function describing the electron confinement in a relatively narrow channel ( its width is assumed to be much smaller than any lateral size and the distance between the 2deg channel and the gate electrode ) . the axis @xmath15 is directed along the channel , so that the coordinates of the side contacts are @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the lengths of the channel and gate ( see fig .  1 ) , respectively ( @xmath19 ) . the axis",
    "@xmath20 is directed perpendicular to the 2deg channel .",

    "the boundary conditions follow from the assumption that the electron sheet densities at the side contacts are fixed and that the electric potentials at the electrodes ( the side contacts to the channel and the gate sections ) are given functions of time . for the electric potential at nonconducting surfaces ( between the electrodes ) linear approximation is used .",
    "it is also assumed that at @xmath23 , the electric field @xmath24 .",
    "the equations of the model under consideration account for the generally two - dimensional character of the potential spatial distribution , as well as the electron transport in the 2deg channel considering electron scattering and viscosity .    in the case of the structures with relatively small thickness of the gate layer @xmath22 ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the characteristic length of the electron density and electric potential nonuniformities )",
    ", the poisson equation ( 3 ) can be replaced by the following :    @xmath27    we shall consider the following case .",

    "the recharging time @xmath32 is determined by the capacitance , @xmath33 , of the gate section and the pertinent resistance , @xmath34 , of the control circuit : @xmath35 .",
    "the bias gate voltages result in a nonuniform distribution of the electron density along the channel , which at @xmath36 exhibits a maximum in the channel center .",
    "we shall mainly consider 2deg systems with uniformly distributed donors in the channel ( or in the gate layer slightly above the channel ) .",

( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) assuming that the gate layer is sufficiently thin , the length of the channel is sufficiently large , so that we may disregard the boundary conditions , and that the electron collisions with impurities and phonons as well as the viscosity can be neglected . in this case",

    ", we have @xmath96  @xmath97/s . since the characteristic value of the coefficient of viscosity in real 2deg systems is @xmath98 ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath99 is the reduced planck constant , for the gaas channel one obtains @xmath100  @xmath97/s .",
    "this implies that @xmath101 and that the electron collisions should not affect the shape of the shock wave front as confirmed by the results on numerical modeling in the following .    in 2deg systems where the gate layer is not too thin ,",
    "the thickness of the wave front @xmath86 can be determined by the deviation of the plasma wave dispersion relation from the linear one ( i.e. , by 2d effects leading to a difference in the group velocities of the harmonics with different wavenumber @xmath40 ) rather than by the viscosity . comparing the contributions of these two mechanisms",
    ", one can find that the first mechanism dominates if @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "thus , in 2deg systems with moderate gate layer thickness , the nonlinear waves should be fairly smooth , so that a soliton - like wave can form  @xcite rather than a shock wave .",

    "4 - 7 correspond to the gate length @xmath121 m ( i.e. , to a fairly long channel ) and @xmath122 . the length of the central gate section is about @xmath123 m . as shown , in systems with small values of the parameter @xmath124 ( figs .  4 and 5 ) , the initial perturbation of the electron density transforms into two pulses propagating from the channel center to the side contacts .",
    "after a short time , the front of these pulses becomes sharp , so the pulses turn into shock waves .",

    "one can see that in this case , the electron density distributions behind the shock wave front exhibit pronounced oscillations . to avoid numerical calculation artifacts ,",
    "the pertinent modeling was conducted with rather different numbers of modes in the fourier transformation ( varied from @xmath127 to @xmath128 ) .",
    "the independence of the result of the number of the modes used in the calculations was confirmed .     with oscillatory structure behind the shock wave front in the system with normalized gate layer thickness @xmath129 and small viscosity ( @xmath130 ) . , width=302 ]    [ fig8 ]    the oscillatory character of the electron density distributions can be attributed to the instability of the shock waves with relatively smooth ( but nonuniform ) distributions behind the shock wave front .",
    "as shown previously  @xcite , the nonuniformity of 2deg in the channel can markedly affect the conditions of plasma instability .",
    "considering the nonuniformity of the electron density distribution in a propagating shock wave and assuming that the characteristic length of this perturbation @xmath131 is small in comparison with the scale of the nonuniformity of the electron density distribution behind the front , one can get the following equation for the damping rate of the electron density perturbations behind the front ( compare with eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) : @xmath132        [ fig9 ]     in the 2deg system with the same parameters as in fig .  4 but at relatively slow voltage switch - off ( @xmath133 ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    [ fig10 ]    in the case im@xmath134 ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath135 the nonuniform but relatively smooth electron density distribution behind the shock wave front can become unstable resulting in the formation of oscillatory distributions .",
    "this instability condition shows that the electron density distribution can be unstable when the gradient of the electron density is sufficiently large .",
    "since the magnitude of the electron density peak decreases with wave propagation ( due to electron collisions ) , and the total number of electrons is constant , the electron density gradient decreases as well . as a result ,",
    "inequality  ( 34 ) can be satisfied for the perturbations with the spatial period increasing with time .",
    "just such a behavior of the oscillatory structure behind the shock wave front is seen in fig .",
    "figure  9 shows how the velocity of the wave front ( normalized by @xmath136 ) changes with time ( normalized by @xmath137 ) .",
    "we define the velocity of the wave front as the velocity of movement of the point where @xmath138 . here , @xmath139 is the peak value of the electron density .",
    "one can see that in 2deg systems with relatively thin gate layers in which the formation of the shock waves occurs ( corresponding to figs .  4 and 5 ) , the velocity of the front movement exceeds the characteristic plasma wave velocity @xmath136 but this front movement decelerates with elapsed time .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , according to the general properties of shock waves  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , their velocity is determined by @xmath136 and @xmath140 ( see eq .",
    "( 20 ) ) with the latter value decreasing throughout the wave propagation ( as seen in figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "however , the velocity of propagation of more smooth pulses ( see curve marked by squares in fig .",
    "9 ) in the case of larger gate thickness is close to @xmath136 .",
    "the results shown in figs .  4 - 8 correspond to relatively fast switch - off of the voltage applied to the central gate section ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the obtained results do not change when @xmath141 increases up to @xmath142 .",
    "however , at relatively slow voltage switch - off , i.e. at moderate values of parameter @xmath141 , the pattern of relaxation of electron density becomes markedly different .",
    "figure  10 shows the relaxation of electron density in the 2deg system with the same parameters as in fig .  4 at @xmath133 .",
    "in this case , the transformation of the electron density distribution closely resembles the density peak smearing considered previously in the framework of the conductive model  @xcite .",
    "in the 2deg system with nonuniform donor distribution . , width=321 ]    [ fig11 ]    consider now a 2deg system with markedly nonuniform distribution of donors @xmath8 along the channel , so that the quantity @xmath82 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) also depends on the coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that    @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the sheet density of donors in the channel center , @xmath145 is the donor density near its edges , and @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the characteristic lengths of the spatial distribution of donors ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "figure  10 shows the evolution of the spatial distribution of the sheet charge density in the 2deg channel normalized by @xmath149 , where the symbol @xmath150 means the averaging over the channel length .",
    "one can see that two soliton - like waves propagating in opposite directions toward the side contacts arise",
    ". however , upon reaching the regions with relatively low donor density ( @xmath151 ) , these waves transform into shock waves with rather sharp fronts and complex structures behind the front .",
    "in particular , the fronts are followed by depletion regions and then by the secondary shock waves .",
    "the behavior pattern of the wave originated from the initial pulse resembles tsunami in the ocean .",
    "this is due to an analogy between the equations governing the 2deg in the systems under consideration and the equations describing the gravity surface waves in shallow and deep water pools .",
    "we studied electrical excitation of nonlinear plasma waves in heterostructures with 2deg channels and split gates .",
    "the propagation of these waves was considered both analytically and using numerical modeling .",
    "the hydrodynamic electron transport model accounted for electron collisions with impurities and phonons as well as 2deg viscosity .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations were supplemented by the 2d poisson equation for the self - consistent electric potential .",
    "we demonstrated the formation of shock and soliton - like waves as a result of the evolution of strongly nonuniform initial electron density distribution .",
    "it was found that the shock wave front and the shape of soliton - like pulses pronouncedly depend on the coefficient of 2deg viscosity , the thickness of the gate layer , and the nonuniformity of the donor distribution along the channel . in the case of the 2deg channel with strongly nonuniform doping , the effect of transformation of relatively smooth waves into shock waves , resembling a tsunami effect ,",
    "was observed .",
    "the electron collisions result in damping of the shock and soliton - like waves .",
    "however , they do not markedly affect the thickness of the shock wave front .",
    "due to the fairly sharp wavefront of nonlinear waves in the 2deg systems under consideration or due to their strongly oscillatory structure ( as shown in fig .",
    "8) , the transient charges induced by the propagating charges of these waves in the side contacts and , hence , in the external circuit might exhibit steep surges .",
    "fast transient currents in such a circuit including an antenna might provide generation of electromagnetic radiation with relatively high frequencies.the heterostructures with a nonuniform doping of 2deg channel appears to be rather promising . in the structures with the gate separated into several short sections ( see the lower structure in fig .  1 ) the propagating charges of shock waves might result in even steeper surges of the charges induced in these section  @xcite . since these sections can serve as an antenna components , fast variations of the induced charges and , hence , the dipole momentum , can lead to emission of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "there are several characteristic frequencies related to the situation : @xmath152 , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the lateral spacing between the neighboring gate sections , and @xmath155 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 can be much larger that the inverse recharhing time @xmath159 easily fall in the terahertz range at realistic values of the characteristics lengths due to fairly large values of the characteristic velocity of plasma wave @xmath136 ( about @xmath160  cm / s ) .",
    "the mechanism of the generation of relatively high frequency electrical signals , which convert into electromagnetic radiation is akin to the frequency multiplication due to the plasma nonlinearity .",
    "thus , the excitation of shock and soliton - like waves in the heterostructures under consideration by external electrical signals might be used to generate terahertz radiation .",
