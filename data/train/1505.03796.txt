    "it is widely accepted that special functions constitute invaluable mathematical tools in almost all areas of natural sciences and engineering . in the wide field of digital communications",
    "they have been extensively used in numerous analytic studies where they typically constitute the derivation of explicit expressions for important performance measures possible .",
    "such measures correspond to the output signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) , channel capacity , error probability and higher - order statistics , to name a few .",
    "in addition , the usefulness of special functions has became ever more evident over the last decades due to the fact that the majority of them is included as built - in functions in popular scientific software packages such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as a result , their traditionally laborious computational realisation as well as their algebraic complexity have been significantly simplified .",
    "+ among others , the rice @xmath13-function and the incomplete lipschitz - hankel integrals ( ilhis ) have been shown to be useful in telecommunications since they have appeared in various analytic solutions of problems related to wireless communication systems .",
    "they were both proposed a few decades ago and they are denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath14 , respectively @xcite . in more details ,",
    "the @xmath1 function is typically defined by a lower incomplete integral which involves an exponential function and a modified bessel function of the first kind and zero order @xcite .",
    "alternative algebraic representations include two series expressions which were reported in @xcite .",
    "these series are infinite and are represented in terms of the modified struve function and the modified bessel function of the first kind , @xcite . moreover , the author in @xcite reported useful closed - form identities between the @xmath13-function and the marcum q - function @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath15 function in digital communications is based on the fact that it has been employed in the study of zero crossing rates , in the analysis of angle modulation systems and in radar pulse detection and error rates in differentially encoded systems , @xcite .",
    "+ in the same context , the ilhis belong to a class of incomplete cylindrical functions which are one of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bessel functions , namely : the bessel function of the first kind , the modified bessel function of the first kind , the bessel function of the second kind , the modified bessel function of the second kind and the hankel functions , respectively @xcite . in the wide field of electrical engineering ,",
    "the ilhis have been largely encountered in analytic solutions of numerous problems related to the theory of electromagnetics , while in communication theory they have been used in recent investigations associated with the error rate analysis of multiple - input - mutiple - output ( mimo ) systems under imperfect channel state information ( csi ) employing adaptive modulation , transmit beamforming and maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) , @xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "+ nevertheless , even thought the above functions have been proved particularly useful in digital communications , it is noticed that they are both neither available in tabulated form , nor are they included as built - in functions in the aforementioned popular scientific software packages .",
    "as a consequence , their corresponding analytical tractability as well as computational realisation appear to be rather laborious and cumbersome .",
    "motivated by this , the aim of this work is the derivation of analytic expressions for the rice @xmath21 function and the @xmath22 integrals .",
    "specifically , a remarkably accurate closed - form approximation is firstly derived for the @xmath21 function .",
    "subsequently , an exact closed - form expression is derived for the @xmath2 integrals for the special case that @xmath5 is an odd multiple of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath23 and a polynomial approximation which , as in the case of @xmath1 function , is valid for all parametric values .",
    "furthermore , upper bounds are derived for the corresponding truncation error of the proposed polynomial approximations .",
    "importantly , these bounds are expressed in closed - form and are shown to be particularly tight .",
    "it is also noted that the derived expressions have a tractable algebraic representation which ultimately renders them easily computable and useful in various analytical studies in wireless communications .",
    "indicatively , such studies include the derivation of explicit expressions for vital performance measures , such as channel capacity and probability of error , in the wide field of digital communications over fading channels and the information - theoretic analysis of mimo systems .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : section ii revisits the definition and basic identities of the rice @xmath13 function and the @xmath22 integrals .",
    "subsequently , sections iii and iv are devoted to the derivation of novel analytic expressions for each of these functions , respectively , finally , discussion on the potential applicability of the offered relationships in wireless communications along with closing remarks , are provided in section v.",

    "nevertheless , computing the @xmath1 function using these expressions is inefficient due to the following three reasons : i ) two relationships are required ; ii ) the above series are relatively unstable due to their infinite form ; iii ) the @xmath32 function is not built - in in widely used mathematical software packages . + an adequate way of resolving this issue was reported in @xcite where the @xmath21 function is related to the known marcum q - function of the first order , namely ,    @xmath36\\ ] ]    and    @xmath37\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath38    @xmath39    and    @xmath40    which was firstly proposed in @xcite .",
