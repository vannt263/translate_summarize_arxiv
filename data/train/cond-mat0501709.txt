    "in spite of the large effort devoted in the last decades , a clear understanding of the interactions of macromolecules in solution is still far from being achieved @xcite . in particular , this is true in the case of globular proteins , which share with colloidal systems a number of common properties @xcite .",
    "> from the experimental point of view , there exist several biophysical techniques for obtaining quantitative data on protein - protein interactions under physiologically relevant conditions . small - angle scattering ( sas ) , for instance , is currently believed to provide very reliable information , under very different experimental conditions ( ph , ionic strength , temperature , etc . ) . if the particle form factors are known , dividing the sas intensity by the average form factor yields the experimental average structure factor , which is related to the radial distribution functions ( rdf ) @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are species indexes ) . a recent experiment @xcite reported small - angle- x - ray scattering ( saxs ) measurements on structural properties of a particular globular protein , the @xmath0-lactoglobulin ( @xmath0lg ) , in acidic solutions ( ph = 2.3 ) , at several values of ionic strength in the range 7 - 507 mm",
    "for this protein there is a clear evidence of a monomer - dimer equilibrium affected by the ionic strength of the solution @xcite , and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to achieve a good fit of the experimental data by using a highly simplified two - component macroion model  ( mimicking monomers and dimers of @xmath0lg ) , with effective forces represented by hard - sphere ( hs ) terms plus the repulsive  yukawa ( screened coulomb ) part of the well - known derjaguin - landau - vervey - overbeek ( dlvo ) potential vervey48 .",
    "one important novelty of that study , compared with previous ones , is the proposal of a relatively simple , improved approximation to the rdfs , suitable for best - fit programs and not restricted to the particular model but equally well applicable to different spherically - symmetric potentials .",
    "> from the theoretical point of view , information on intermolecular forces can be extracted from the experimental average structure factor by comparison with a theoretical one , whose calculation requires the choice not only of an interaction model but also of a recipe for deriving the rdfs from the intermolecular potentials . at present ,",
    "the most accurate techniques for evaluating rdfs are the exact  computer simulations - monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) - and the approximate  integral equations ( ie ) from the statistical mechanical theory of classical fluids @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such complex methods can hardly be included into a best - fit program for analyzing experimental data .",
    "in fact , mc or md simulations require long computational times , and become difficult in regimes characteristic of globular proteins in solution ( i.e. , low concentration , high charges , asymmetry in size and charge among the components of the mixture ) . on the other hand , only for a very limited number of simple potentials and within an even more limited number of approximate closures , ies of liquid theory admit analytical solutions , providing closed - form expressions to be inserted into best - fit codes @xcite . in all other cases ,",
    "an iterative numerical procedure is necessary , and this poses a major drawback to any fitting scheme .",
    "moreover , numerical solution of the ie closures tends to become unstable or does not converge in the region of our interest . in order to simplify the problem ,",
    "most analyses of sas data for highly dilute solutions employ the crude approximation of neglecting all intermolecular forces , assuming either large interparticle separations or weak interactions . in this case ,",
    "@xmath4 , the average structure factor equals unity and the sas intensity depends only upon the average form factor . a common first improvement over the previous choice then corresponds to approximating the rdfs with their zero - density limit , given by the boltzmann factor , i.e. @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the pair potential , and @xmath7 the inverse of the thermal energy ( absolute temperature multiplied by boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "however , this zero - density approximation becomes insufficient at moderate concentrations or in regimes of colloidal or protein solutions when electrostatic interactions are strong , i.e. at low ionic strength .",
    "motivated by this scenario , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a more accurate representation of @xmath1 that takes into account , according to a perturbative scheme , terms up to the first - order in the density expansion of the potential of mean force , @xmath8 meeron58 ( note that the @xmath9-expansion should not be confused with the rdf one , since these two expansions differ even at the first - order in density ) .  while the satisfactory best - fit results of ref .",
    "spinozzi02 seem to indicate that a first - order approximation to @xmath9 ( w1-approximation ) is sufficiently accurate for low concentrations such as the experimental conditions under study , there is no way , _ a priori _ , to tell _ where _ this approximation breaks down , in the absence of some exact results  to compare with . on the other hand , as the experimental conditions present in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite are fairly typical in the context of proteins in solution , we feel that it would be interesting to make such a comparison .",
    "thus the main subject of the present paper , which complements the methodological part of the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , is not the proposal of a new potential model for @xmath0lg , but a test of the w1-approximation against more accurate ( mc and ie ) structural results .",
    "we perform mc simulations , at constant volume , temperature and total number of macroparticles , for the _ same _ hs - yukawa - dlvo binary model , representing monomers and dimers of @xmath0lg , investigated in ref . spinozzi02 .",
    "various values of the screening parameter are considered , and the mc results for @xmath1 are compared with the corresponding ones predicted by the aforesaid w1-approximation as well as by some commonly used ies . in order to ensure always a good accuracy , the mc calculations are carried out with and without a suitable ewald construction @xcite , which is expected to play a major role in the cases of strong long - range interactions ( weak screening ) . although the theoretical framework for the ewald construction , well - known for unscreened coulomb forces , has already been extended to yukawa interactions in recent refs .",
    "rosenfeld96,salin00 , this work represents , to the best of our knowledge , the first mc detailed analysis of its implementation and performance for the repulsive yukawa case @xcite .",
    "our calculations allow a rather precise determination of the limits of validity for the w1-expansion .",
    "they also show clearly the degree of reliability of some typical ies under these frequently encountered , demanding , regimes .",
    "it is worthwhile stressing that our results are in fact rather general , as there exists a large variety of physical phenomena which can be described by yukawa potentials @xcite .",
    "the existence of exact  computer simulations for a binary model with these potentials would then prove to be useful within a much more general context than the one treated here .",
    "when mesoscopic ( colloidal or protein ) particles with ionizable surface groups are put into a microscopic polar solvent ( like water ) , most of the charged surface groups dissociate into the solvent and form microscopic _ counterions _ , usually carrying one or two elementary charges . consequently",
    ", the big particles acquire high charges of opposite sign and are called _ macroions _ or _ polyions_. at equilibrium the counterions are located around the charged macroions , forming an electric double layer .",
    "the counterion distribution tends to screen the repulsions between macroions , which have charges of the same sign .",
    "the result is a screened coulomb ( yukawa ) repulsion between macroions , which ensures the stability of the solution ( charge - stabilization ) with respect to a possible irreversible flocculation .",
    "an important feature of such repulsions is that they can be tuned , by adding a suitable amount of a simple electrolyte to the solution .",
    "in fact , such a salt provides additional free _ microions _",
    "( co - ions , with same charge sign as the macroions , as well as other counter - ions ) , which increase the degree of screening and thus reduce the macroion - macroion repulsions @xcite .    a @xmath0lg solution thus consists of many components : two different forms of macroions ( protein monomers and dimers ) , counterions , coions and the solvent . at neutral ph , the structure of the @xmath0lg protein is dimeric , while at acidic ph ( a condition more similar to the physiological one ) a partial dissociation into two monomers takes place . the monomer - dimer equilibrium , which determines the molar fractions of both macroion species , depends upon the ionic strength of the solution . at low ionic strength ,",
    "the screening is weak and the electrostatic repulsions predominate over the attractive forces responsible for the formation of dimers ; as a consequence , most of the macroions are monomers . on the contrary , at high ionic strength",
    "a strong screening reduces the monomer - monomer repulsions in such a way that a large fraction of dimers can form .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we represent such a @xmath0lg multicomponent solution at a highly simplified , primitive model , level of description , using an effective two - component macroion model , which takes into account only protein particles @xcite .",
    "in fact , the solvent is regarded as a uniform dielectric continuum , all microions are treated as point - like particles , and macroions ( both monomers and dimers ) are assumed to be charged hard spheres , with different diameters .",
    "the presence of both solvent and microions appears only in the macroion - macroion _ effective _ potentials . in the spirit of the dlvo theory @xcite , we shall then describe the protein - protein interactions with the simple effective potential @xmath10(@xmath11 , with species 1 and 2 corresponding to monomers and dimers , respectively ) . here",
    "the hard - sphere term accounts for excluded volume effects @xmath12where @xmath13 is the distance of closest approach between two macroparticles of species @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand , the _",
    "renormalized _ yukawa term @xmath14}{r }   \\label{p3}\\]]represents an _ effective _ screened coulomb repulsion between two _ isolated _ macroions _ in a sea of microions _ , and has the same yukawa form as in the debye - hckel theory of electrolytes , but with coupling coefficients of dlvo type @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the elementary charge , @xmath16 the dielectric constant of the solvent , @xmath17 the valency of species @xmath2 , and @xmath18 is the inverse debye screening length due _ only _ to _ microions _ , given by @xmath19@xmath20 is the avogadro number , and @xmath21 denotes the ionic strength of the counterions originated from the ionization of the protein macromolecules ( the molar concentration @xmath22 of these counterions is related to the macroion concentrations through the electroneutrality condition , @xmath23 ) , while @xmath24 is the ionic strength of all microions ( cations and anions ) generated by added salts .",
    "clearly , @xmath25 depends on temperature and represents an indication of the range of the screened coulomb interactions , with @xmath26 corresponding to pure coulomb potentials , whereas @xmath27 yields the opposite hs limit .",
    "while in real experiments @xmath18 is fixed by the chemical conditions of the solution ( namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , in this work we shall not consider @xmath29 as an independent variable , but , in view of our methodological purpose , we shall regard @xmath30 as an independent reduced screening parameter .",
    "a measure of the concentration of the two - macroion effective mixture will be given by the volume fraction @xmath31where @xmath32 is the partial number density of the @xmath2-th macroion species ( point - like microions and solvent do not appear here ) . the definition of the model is then completed by providing one of the two molar fractions @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 is the total density .",
    "now , following partly ref .",
    "@xcite , we add three remarks about some assumptions involved in the choice of the model potential .",
    "\\i ) at first glance one might suspect that reducing dimers to equivalent spheres ( with a volume twice as large as the monomer ) , i.e. neglecting the asymmetry of the dimer molecular shape may seem a too drastic simplification . in order to clarify this point , it is to be stressed that in refs . @xcite",
    "two different levels of description for the dimer were used in the two factors which contribute to the sas intensity .",
    "the coherent scattering intensity @xmath36 was written as @xmath37where @xmath38 is the magnitude of the scattering vector , @xmath39 the angular average of the form factor of species @xmath2 , and the ashcroft - langreth partial structure factors ( for spherically - symmetric intermolecular potentials ) are defined by    @xmath40    in terms of the three - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath41 .",
    "a very accurate procedure was used to calculate numerically both macroion form factors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , from crystallographic data , taking into account , in particular , the _ exact _ elongated shape and structure of the dimer , i.e. its distribution of scattering matter spinozzi02,baldini99 .",
    "thus the approximation of spherical dimers was restricted only to the calculation of @xmath44 , which is related , through @xmath1 , to the intermolecular potentials . at low protein concentrations ,",
    "the choice of spherically - symmetric hard - core potentials can indeed be justified .",
    "as in such regimes the average distance among particles is large , intermolecular forces are dominated by the long - range electrostatic interactions , whereas the details of the short - range repulsions ( i.e. the excluded volume effects ) are irrelevant .",
    "\\ii ) our potentials are purely repulsive .",
    "we have not included the attractive van der waals part of the dlvo  potential for charged colloidal suspensions ( the so - called hamaker term @xcite ) , as it has already been shown to be unnecessary for this system in previous work @xcite .",
    "the basic reason is that van der waals attractions may be fully masked by the electrostatic repulsions when the latter are strong , and are also negligible for moderately charged particles with a diameter smaller then 50 nm nagele96 .",
    "moreover , the hamaker term diverges at contact , so that , to circumvent this singularity , the inclusion of the attractive term would require the addition of a stern layer of counterions ( with finite size ) condensed on the macroion surface @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) given that the specific protein forms dimers , it appears that the @xmath45lg necessarily has a short - range monomer - monomer attraction ( related to the surface groups ) , that causes the aggregation into dimers and determines the monomer molar fraction @xmath46 .",
    "one expects this attractive term ( possibly including hydrogen bonding ) to be rather complex and non - spherically - symmetric .",
    "if such a contribution were clearly understood and easily tractable , one could start  from a more fundamental viewpoint , choosing a model which considers only monomers and includes the aforementioned attraction into their pair potential .",
    "one could then monitor the dimerization fraction within this _ one - component _ system .",
    "however , this analysis may be a project on its own right and goes beyond the aims of the present study .    more simply , in order to avoid poorly known and angular - dependent potentials , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite adopted the viewpoint of using a _ binary _ ( monomer - dimer ) rather than a one - component model , and the required attraction was accounted only indirectly , by using a chemical association equilibrium to evaluate @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "while the dependence of @xmath46 upon the added salt ( i.e. upon @xmath29 ) must be taken into account in any best - fit analysis with the binary model spinozzi02,baldini99 , in the present work , for the sake of simplicity , we shall consider @xmath46 as an independent parameter .",
    "most of our calculations will be performed at equal molar fractions , @xmath47 , but in the last part of the paper we shall also address the effect of changing the molar fractions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , one of the most commonly used procedures to compute rdfs @xmath1 for a given pair potential @xmath6 goes through the solution of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) ies from the liquid state theory , within some approximate closure relation .",
    "this can typically be done only numerically , with the exception of few simple cases ( for some potentials and peculiar closures ) , where the solution can be worked out analytically @xcite .    note that , for hs - yukawa potentials , the oz equations do admit analytical solution @xcite , within the so - called mean spherical approximation  ( msa ) , to be discussed further below . on the other hand , under the experimental regime which we are interested in @xcite , namely low density and strong electrostatic repulsions ( weak screening ) , the msa is well known to display a serious drawback since rdfs may assume unphysical negative values close to contact distance @xmath48 , for particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 which repel each other . to overcome this shortcoming for repulsive yukawa models ,",
    "it would be possible to utilize an analytical rescaled msa  @xcite ( this possibility will not be investigated in the present paper ) or to resort to different closures .    in general then , only numerical solutions are feasible , and thus ie algorithms can hardly be included into best - fit programs for the analysis of sas results .",
    "the use of analytical solutions , or simple approximations requiring only a minor computational effort , is clearly much more advantageous when fitting experimental data .",
    "this can be done by resorting to the following exact , albeit formal , relation    @xmath49 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ]    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the potential of mean force , which includes the direct pair potential @xmath52 as well as @xmath53 , i.e. the indirect interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath54 due to their interactions with all remaining macroparticles of the fluid . in the density expansion of @xmath51 @xmath55    the _ exact _ power coefficients @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )",
    "can be computed by using standard diagrammatic techniques @xcite , which yield the results in terms of multi - dimensional integrals of products of mayer functions @xmath58 -1 .",

    "the w0-approximation avoids the problem of solving the oz equations , but is largely inaccurate except , perhaps , at extremely low densities .",
    "we then consider the @xmath63-order perturbative correction ( w1-approximation ) spinozzi02 @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{e6}\\]]by construction , this expression is never negative , thus overcoming the major drawback of msa .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath65 reads @xmath66the evaluation of the convolution integral @xmath67 is most easily carried out in bipolar coordinates . after an integration over angle variables @xmath67 reduces to @xmath68 \\int_{\\left\\vert x - r\\right\\vert } ^{x+r}dy\\ [ yf_{kj}(y ) ] .",
    "\\label{e8}\\ ] ]    of course , the use of the w1-approximation is not restricted to the model of this paper , and the proposed calculation scheme can be equally well applied to different spherically - symmetric potentials . while it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how this first - order correction largely improves the fit of experimental scattering data , over the w0-one and under those experimental conditions , little could be said on the limits of validity of the w1-approximation with respect to an ( hypothetical ) exact calculation .",
    "this is the reason why we tackle this task here by a comparison with mc simulations for a binary hs - yukawa - dlvo system .",
    "the difficulties involved in monte carlo calculations dealing with pure coulomb potentials are well known @xcite .",
    "it is now widely appreciated the usefulness of the so - called ewald sum for long - range electrostatic interactions @xcite . on the other hand",

    "our results indicate @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 being the side length of the cubic simulation box ) to be the optimal choice , which is of the same order of magnitude of the one typically used in the coulomb case .",

    "this will strengthen the usefulness of the w1-approximation , in view of its simplicity compared to a typical ie calculation for a binary mixture .",

    "the w1-results are not reported in this figure , since they are way off from the mc data ( with an overestimation of about a factor @xmath150 ) . on the other hand , even the results from the py approximation are significantly displaced from the mc rdfs .",
    "the difference between the hnc and py results is apparent , particularly for the latter , as expected .",
    "the py approximation overestimates both the heights and positions of the peaks , compared to the hnc ones .",
    "overall the py approximation fails to describe the mc calculation for @xmath151 , whereas the hnc closure is consistently in good agreement with the mc data .",
    "such a good performance of the hnc closure closely resembles the good agreement between hnc and mc , even at strong coulomb coupling , for the _ one - component _ fluid of _ point _ charges ( electron gas or plasma , with @xmath152 ) ( ocp ) in a uniform neutralizing background @xcite .",
    "however , the results for our binary model with screening at packing fraction @xmath104 can hardly be compared with the available mc simulations for _ one - component _ charged hard spheres ( occs , with @xmath152 ) in a uniform neutralizing background , at @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "it is known the inadequacy of the hnc for high charges at low concentrations ( for instance , in the dilute regime of 2 - 2 aqueous electrolytes rossky80,ciccariello82 , where bridge diagrams become non - negligible for like - charge rdfs ) . on the other hand , despite the large number of comparisons among py , hnc and mc predictions carried out over the years , we are not aware of a similar detailed rdf investigation under regimes characteristic of globular proteins in solution , for hs - yukawa - dlvo binary models .",
    "next we consider the effect of taking into proper account the long - range nature of the interactions ( in the weakly screened case ) with the use of the ewald construction .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , where the rdfs computed with and without the ewald construction are compared at @xmath148 and @xmath154 , respectively . clearly",
    ", very little difference is detected between these two calculations when @xmath148 ( and when @xmath155 , not shown ) .",
    "we find that the the presence of the ewald construction begins to be important for very low values of the screening parameter ( @xmath156 , i.e. @xmath157 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "supplementary calculations , not reported here , confirm that this is true even for lower values of protein charges , that is for weaker coulomb coupling .    finally , we consider the effect of varying the molar fractions . while the exact conditions reported in the @xmath0lg experiment pose a very difficult challenge to an accurate mc calculation in view of the particular combination of strong asymmetry and repulsions , we can nevertheless easily account for the general trend .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we have assumed @xmath144 and @xmath158 , in closer analogy with a @xmath0lg experimental case , @xmath144 and @xmath146 when @xmath147 mm .",

    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath108 and @xmath140 ( corresponding to the lowest value of ionic strength , @xmath109 mm ) .",

    "we note that , in view of the low molar fraction of species @xmath150 ( dimers ) , the results of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] refer to a higher number of particles ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this work represents a necessary verification of the best - fit analysis of sas experimental data , for solutions of @xmath0-lactoglobulin , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have assessed the limits of validity of the w1-approximation , exploited in that work to calculate , in a simple way , the rdfs in regimes typical of a large class of  globular proteins in solution , that is low concentrations and high macroion charges .",
    "this task has been accomplished by considering the _ same _ highly simplified model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. a _ binary _ mixture of monomers and dimers of the protein , with hs - yukawa - dlvo effective potentials ) , and comparing the corresponding @xmath160 obtained by three different methods : the first - order density expansion of the potential of mean force ( w1-approximation ) , exact  mc simulations and approximate ies . all results reported here refer to @xmath104 and high macroion charges , @xmath96 and @xmath161 . for the mc simulations we have implemented an ewald construction for yukawa potentials , which ensures a proper treatment of the long - range part of the interactions , and we have tested its relevance as a function of the screening parameter @xmath114 . in the ie calculations simple closures ( py , hnc , and msa ) as well as more elaborated ones ( ry and hmsa ) have been considered .",

    "spinozzi02 was fully legitimate , for all considered cases including those with the lowest ionic strength ( @xmath109 mm , @xmath140 , @xmath166 ) , which lies near the borderline of the reliability region . for weaker screening ( lower values of @xmath114 or larger @xmath25 )",
    "at least second - order terms in the density expansion should be taken into account . however",
    ", the resulting w2-approximation would require a much higher computational effort and thus could not be conveniently included into a best - fit program for analyzing sas experimental data .",
    "\\ii ) in the mc simulations the ewald construction for yukawa potentials starts to be important for weak screening corresponding to @xmath167 ( @xmath157 ) , and this is true even for lower values of the protein charges .",
    "\\iii ) both the hnc and py ies yield sufficiently accurate values of the rdfs , as long as @xmath164 . for lower values of @xmath114 hnc",
    "is still accurate , whereas py starts to deviate as expected .",
    "the msa predictions , on the other hand , are very poor even in those regimes where the w1-approximation can be considered reliable . under these conditions",
    "both the ry and hmsa closures are found not to achieve thermodynamic consistency between compressibility and virial pressures .",
    "\\iv ) the sufficient accuracy of the w1-approximation in the regimes of our interest ( tested in this paper against exact  mc results ) , together with its success ( shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in reproducing the main features of the experimental sas intensity curves for the examined @xmath0lg solutions , confirm the good performance of the highly idealized two - macroion model , which includes spherically - symmetric hs - yukawa - dlvo repulsions , a monomer - dimer chemical equilibrium , and the exact  form factors , evaluated by taking into account the real non - spherical structure of the dimer .    clearly , all complex characteristics of the interactions between globular proteins can not be explained by the primitive  level of description adopted in ref .",
    "spinozzi02 and here .",
    "we have followed the generally accepted philosophy of exploiting the simplest possible description of the system , which yet can provide useful information on the basic underlying interaction mechanism .",
    "the determination of the trueprotein - protein potentials thus remains an open problem .",
    "our choice of _ purely repulsive _ interactions illustrates the minimal assumptions allowing a satisfactory reproduction of the sas data for @xmath0lg . in many studies on colloidal or protein solutions",
    ", satisfactory results were obtained from very simplified models .",
    "the use of sophisticated potentials , with a large number of different contributions , is often unnecessary at the first stages .",
    "moreover , a high level of description for potentials would be in striking contrast with the poor level of approximation to the rdfs ( w0-approximation ) commonly adopted in many analyses of experimental data .    as regards the approximation of _ spherical symmetry _ , used for the protein - protein interactions ( but not in the calculation of the form factors ) , we remark that it represent a common simplifying choice .",
    "in particular , it is worth recalling a very recent study by pellicane _",
    "@xcite , which reports evidence that the phase diagram of prototype globular protein solutions ( lysozyme and @xmath168-crystallin in water and added salt ) can be reasonably reproduced by a spherically - symmetric representation of macromolecular interactions .",
    "these authors employed a hs - yukawa - dlvo one - component potential , including the hamaker attractive part .",
    "evidently , in addition to the molecular granularity of the solvent and the finite sizes of all microions , a highly refined model description of protein solutions should embody the asymmetry of the molecular shape as well as the heterogeneity of the macroion surface charge distribution .",
    "the presence of different charged surface groups may produce charge patches  that have a sign opposite to that of the net macroion charge .",
    "the importance of non - spherically - symmetric models with an inhomogeneous distribution of positively and negatively charged groups was recently investigated in a mc study on the electrostatic complexation of flexible polyelectrolytes with @xmath169-lactalbumin and @xmath0-lactoglobulin @xcite .    as a final remark to the present paper ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that we are not aware of any previous investigations of this type within the hs - yukawa - dlvo binary model and in regimes typical of globular proteins in solution .",
    "our results and the methodological approach based upon the w1-approximation are expected to be useful in the analysis of sas experiments .",
    "it would be rather interesting to pursue a similar study on the thermodynamic predictions of the first - order approximation .",
    "this could be easily carried out , as all thermodynamic quantities can be inferred either directly or through the knowledge of the rdfs .",
    "another interesting issue , within the present framework , involves an increase of the asymmetry between the two considered molecular sizes , which is known to lead to possible depletion effects @xcite .",
