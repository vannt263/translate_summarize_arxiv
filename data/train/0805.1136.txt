    "jean bernard lon foucault conducted his first pendulum experiment in paris in january 1851 , aiming to prove the rotation of the earth by demonstrating the rotation of the plane of swings .",
    "originally , the suspension length of the pendulum was 2 m. the next experiment was set up with the suspension length 11 m at the observatory of paris .",
    "louis - napolon bonaparte , the first titular president of the french republic and nephew of the famed napoleon i of france , was informed of foucault s work and proposed him to conduct an experiment at the panthon .",
    "the experiment took place on 31 march 1851 , with the pendulum bob weight 28 kg suspended under the panthon dome by a steel wire 67 m long .",
    "aristarchus of samos who proposed the first consistent heliocentric model around 270 b. c. explained the observed rotation of stars by the axial rotation of the earth .",
    "similar ideas were discussed earlier by philolaus , philosopher of the pythagorean school , in the v - th century b. c. and by greek philosopher herakleides in the iv - th century b. c. if idea on the axial rotation of the earth is correct , one can expect that because of inertia the plane of swings of the foucault s pendulum does revolve delaying the earth rotation .",
    "it , however , the earth is fixed and motionless , as was embraced by both aristotle , ptolemy , and most greek philosophers , the swing plane of foucault s pendulum can not rotate .    from the technical point of view , the experiment with the foucault s pendulum was accessible to all ancient and more recent civilizations , including greeks , nevertheless , the experiment has been done in the new era only . during one and half thousands of years",
    "it was assumed that the problem of rotation of the stars does not require additional attention because of the incontestable authority of aristotle and success of the ptolemy heocentric model that described and describes until now the motion of planes with high precision .",
    "the interest to the problem and discussions recommenced again in the xvi century after the works of nicolaus copernicus and completed essentially after the works of johannes kepler at the beginning of the xvii century .    from the viewpoint of an observer at the earth , remote stars complete one rotation in the clockwise direction during 1 sidereal day = 23 hours , 56 minutes , 4.091 seconds .",
    "the observed rotation rate , @xmath0 per hour , of foucault s pendulum is not equal to @xmath1 per hour , nor is it zero ( the minus sign indicates that the swing plane rotates clockwise ) .",
    "if an observer in the coordinate system of the remote stars transports the foucault s pendulum to the north pole along the earth meridians keeping the angle between the pendulum s plane and the meridians fixed , she will detect a uniform precession of the pendulum s plane relative to the remote stars .",
    "the rotation angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , relative to the remote stars and the earth meridians , respectively , are related by @xmath4 for one sidereal day . in the adiabatic approximation and for small swing angles ,",
    "the rotation angle @xmath2 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the polar angle .",
    "the adiabaticity means that the period of the earth s rotation is much greater than the period of the swings .",
    "the equation of rotation of the plane of swings of foucault s pendulum , as illustration of the laws of classical mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and also section iii ) , is an element of program of university courses of physical faculties .",
    "thus , the foucault s pendulum , placed at the north pole , during the day turns at an angle @xmath7 . at the equator",
    "the pendulum does not rotate .",
    "the panthon in paris is located at the parallel @xmath8 ( in geography one speaks about the latitude @xmath9 ) . from the equations we obtain @xmath10 per hour ,",
    "which is consistent with the observations on the foucault s pendulum and precludes accompanying `` rotation of heavens '' with high accuracy .",
    "the rotation of the plane of the pendulum provided the first evidence for the rotation of the earth by terrestrial means .    in the process of movement of the pendulum along the surface of the earth the plane of swings , as a consequence of the laws of classical mechanics , remains parallel to itself @xcite .",
    "this remarkable fact allows to investigate the evolution of the foucault s pendulum using geometric methods .",
    "the bob s velocity in the equilibrium point is tangent to the surface of the earth , and therefore belongs to the tangent space of the surface .",
    "the plane of swings of the pendulum can be described by a vector orthogonal to it .",
    "such a vector lies in a plane tangent to the earth s surface also . in the absence of external forces and/or torques tangent vectors under the displacement experience _",
    "parallel transport_. for example , vectors tangent to minkowski spacetime , @xmath11 , like four - velocity , remain fixed under displacement , whereas tangent vectors of curved spaces like the surface of a sphere , @xmath12 , or the space of physical relativistic velocities , rotate under displacement in order to remain tangent to the corresponding surface .",
    "this kind of evolution is associated with _",
    "inertial motion_. in the first case the displacements occur in minkowski spacetime , in the second and third cases the displacements occur on the surface of a sphere and in the space of physical relativistic velocities , respectively .    the geometric basis of the relativistic effect known today as thomas precession has been discovered in 1913 year by french mathematician mile borel @xcite .",
    "he pointed out noncommutativity of non - collinear lorentz transformations , described an analogy between transformations of vectors on a spherical surface and in the physical relativistic velocity space , and provided the lowest order estimate of kinematic precession of axes of a rigid body on a circular orbit .",
    "the same year two young mathematicians ludwig fppl and percy john daniell derived exact expression for the rotation angle due to thomas precession , corresponding to one period of a uniform circular motion @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is rapidity , @xmath15 is lorentz factor , @xmath16 is velocity of the body , and @xmath17 is speed of light .",
    "the work of fppl and daniell has been recommended for publication by david hilbert .",
    "the relativistic precession effect has been known at about the same time to ludwik silberstein @xcite .    in the early 1920s , enrico fermi @xcite , and later arthur walker @xcite , established a transport rule for vectors to construct preferred reference frames in the general theory of relativity . in the fermi - walker transport , vectors tangent to the physical relativistic velocity space behave like the axes of a rigid body as described by borel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem of the relativistic precession has attracted attention of physicists , since llewellyn thomas @xcite uncovered its fundamental significance for theory of atomic spectra .",
    "the effect was found to reduce the spin - orbit splitting of the atomic energy levels by a factor 1/2 known presently as the thomas half . in the course of his work",
    ", thomas has only been aware of de sitter s paper on the relativistic precession of the moon , published in a book by arthur eddington @xcite .",
    "group - theory aspects of the spin rotation under the lorentz transformations were introduced to physicists by eugene paul wigner @xcite .",
    "the term `` wigner rotation '' is used as a synonym of the rotation of a spinning particle under the coordinate transformations and specifically as a synonym of `` thomas precession '' , too .",
    "the history of early study of the relativistic precession effect is described in ref .",
    "as claimed by robert merton , multiple independent discoveries represent the common pattern in science @xcite .",
    "recently , the geometric nature of the spin precession effect of a relativistic particle has again attracted attention .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the rotation angle @xmath18 is determined by an integral over the surface limited by the closed trajectory of the particle in the physical relativistic velocity space .",
    "this property characterizes parallel transport of vectors in a riemannian space ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "parallel transport in the relativistic velocity space and thomas precession were discussed in @xcite in detail .",
    "rotation angles @xmath19 and @xmath18 correspond to a geometrical phase that occurs in many areas of physics [ 4 , 5 , 18 ] .",
    "the analogy between rotations and lorentz transformations is of the high heuristic value . in particular , we recall that the relativistic velocity addition theorem can be obtained as the composition law for arcs of the great circles on a sphere of imaginary radius in a four - dimensional euclidean space with one imaginary coordinate ( time ) . by introducing the imaginary coordinate ( time ) , it is possible to transform a hyperboloid of physical relativistic velocities into a sphere of imaginary radius in a four - dimensional euclidean space . both for foucault s pendulum and for thomas precession , the surface along which a displacement occurs",
    "can be considered a sphere .",
    "this suggests that the rotation effects of foucault s swinging pendulum and thomas precession , obviously , are geometrically identical ; this does not necessarily contradict to the different physical natures of these systems .",
    "the aim of this methodological note is to show that expressions for the rotation angles @xmath19 and @xmath18 can be obtained by the same method using elementary geometrical tools for parallel transport of vectors over corresponding surfaces . in the first case , this is the earth s surface , i.e. , a spherical surface in the euclidean space @xmath20 . in the second case , this is the physical relativistic velocity space , i.e. , the hyperboloid @xmath21 in the tangent space @xmath22 of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the visual tangent - cone geometric method used to derive the main equations in sections iii and iv is often used to illustrate the effect of curvature on the parallel transport of vectors along a spherical surface ( see , e.g. , appendix 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this method was used by somerville @xcite and hart , miller , and r. l. mills @xcite to describe the evolution of foucault s pendulum . in section",
    "ii , we recall the main principles of parallel transport . in section iii , based on the consideration of foucault s pendulum evolution from the dynamic standpoint ,",
    "we show that the evolution is reduced to parallel transport of the swing plane of the pendulum over a spherical surface , and obtain eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in section iv ,",
    "the tangent - cone method is generalized to the case of thomas precession and is used to obtain expression ( 2 ) .",
    "the concept of parallel transport of vectors originates in euclidean geometry .",
    "two vectors are said to be parallel if two straight lines that pass through the endpoints of these vectors are parallel in the sense of euclid s fifth postulate and their orientations coincide .",
    "any continuous transformation which preserves length and keeps the vectors parallel at each infinitesimal step is called _",
    "parallel transport_.    given a vector @xmath23 at a point @xmath24 , there exists one and only one vector @xmath25 at point @xmath26 that can be constructed by parallel transport of @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath26 . in euclidean space , the summation and subtraction of vectors at different points are defined with the help of parallel transport and the triangle rule .",
    "the condition of parallel transport may therefore be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for an infinitesimal displacement .",
    "equation ( [ pt1 ] ) is also valid for finite displacement .",
    "parallel transport has a natural description in analytic geometry .",
    "the cartesian coordinate system is defined by basis vectors @xmath29 constructed at an arbitrary point @xmath24 and transported parallel to other points : @xmath30 contravariant coordinates of a vector @xmath23 are fixed by the decomposition @xmath31 ; covariant coordinates are scalar products @xmath32 . because the basis is orthonormal @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "parallel transport is defined by equation ( [ pt1 ] ) to first order in displacement .",
    "globally , parallel transport refers to transformation along a curve , where a vector undergoes local parallel transport at every step . in riemannian space ,",
    "parallel transport preserves the scalar product and as a consequence lengths and angles between vectors .    during parallel transport along a straight line in euclidean space ,",
    "the angle the vector @xmath23 makes with the path remains fixed .",
    "such a property holds locally in riemannian space . together with the requirement of fixed length , this uniquely defines parallel transport in two - dimensional riemannian space . as a consequence ,",
    "the angle remains fixed globally along the entire geodesic .",
    "in higher dimensions there still exists a freedom to rotate @xmath23 around a vector tangent to the path . under parallel transport in euclidean space and locally in riemannian space , @xmath23 remains within the initial two - dimensional plane spanned by @xmath23 and the vector @xmath41 tangent to the path at @xmath24 .",
    "this property forbids arbitrary rotations and uniquely defines parallel transport in riemannian spaces of higher dimensions .",
