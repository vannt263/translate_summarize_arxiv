    "it is a very important problem for particle physicists and astrophysicists whether a neutrino has a finite mass or not .",
    "neutrinos are likely massive since it is known that neutrinos should have a mass to solve some astrophysical problems such as solar neutrino problem ( e.g ,  @xcite ) . among three species of neutrinos",
    ", it is presumed that @xmath0 neutrino is heaviest .",
    "the present experimental upper bound on the mass of @xmath0 neutrino is @xcite @xmath9 on the other hand , the mass of a stable @xmath0 neutrino should be less than about 100ev otherwise its cosmic density exceeds the critical density of the universe .",
    "therefore massive @xmath0 neutrino with mass between 100ev and 24mev must be unstable , i.e. , decays into other particles .",
    "however the radiative decay of a massive neutrino is stringently constrained by laboratory experiments , astrophysics and cosmology and only non - radiative decay is allowed .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis can strongly constrain on such neutrino properties , in particular the number of neutrino species , mass , lifetime , chemical potential and so on , when we compare the theoretical prediction of light elements ( @xmath10 , d , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) with the primordial value inferred from the observational data .",
    "for example , since neutrino is one of the dominant components of the energy density in the universe at the bbn epoch , the change of neutrino energy density affects the hubble expansion rate and alters the freeze out time of neutron to proton ratio .",
    "then the predicted light element abundances , especially @xmath10 in this case , are sensitively changed .",
    "more precisely we measure the primordial component of light element abundances , more strongly we constrain on such neutrino properties .",
    "recently d abundances were measured in high red - shift qso absorption systems which would not suffer from the effects of the chemical evolution and would have d abundance which is closer to the primordial value . however , two groups have reported inconsistent d / h values which are different in one order of magnitude . since we do not have any definite models of the galactic and stellar chemical evolutions",
    ", it may be premature for us to judge which measurements are more correct .",
    "if the high d abundances , d / h = @xmath13  @xcite , in high red - shift qso absorption systems are adopted as the primordial values , since they agree with other light element measurements , we can obtain the rigid constraints for some model parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "if the low d abundances , d / h = @xmath14  @xcite , are adopted , there is a discrepancy between the standard bbn theory and the observational measurements .",
    "this leads to the similar problem which was pointed out by hata et al .",
    "( 1995 )  @xcite though they used the data for d and @xmath15he in solar neighborhood and a simple chemical evolution model to infer the primordial abundances .",
    "they found that theoretical predictions agree with the observational data if the number of neutrino species @xmath16 is less than 2.6 .",
    "the point is that the prediction of the standard ( @xmath17 ) bbn for @xmath18he is too large if the photon - baryon ratio @xmath19 is chosen to fit the d data ( or the prediction of d is too large if @xmath19 is determined by @xmath18he data ) . in this case",
    ", we should look for non - standard scenarios .",
    "there are a couple of ideas proposed to solve the discrepancy .",
    "one can reduce the abundance of @xmath18he by assuming non - standard properties of neutrinos ( e.g. degenerate electron neutrino  @xcite , massive neutrino ) or can decrease the d abundance by decays of exotic particles  @xcite . in particular , it was pointed out  @xcite that a massive and short lived @xmath0 neutrino with mass @xmath20(mev ) and lifetime about @xmath21 sec .",
    "can reduce the effective number of neutrino species and hence the abundance of @xmath18he . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of a massive and short lived @xmath0 neutrino on the bbn with a statistical analysis . compared with the recent observational data , especially adopting the low d / h in high z qso absorption systems as a deuterium value",
    ", we find that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 the theoretical predictions agree with the all observational data . in the case where we choose the high d abundance , we find the upper bound of the @xmath0 neutrino mass , @xmath24 .",
    "we study the bbn effects of the decaying @xmath0 neutrino by solving a set of boltzmann equations which describe the evolution of momentum distributions of the @xmath0 neutrino and its decay products . a dirac @xmath25 with mass larger than few tens of kev is not allowed since it cools sn1987a too fast .",
    "thus , in this paper we only consider a majorana @xmath0 neutrino .",
    "we take into account the three interactions , ( 1 ) decay process , ( 2 ) pair annihilation and creation process , and ( 3 ) scattering process . concerning the decay process",
    ", we suppose that a massive majorana @xmath0 neutrino with mass @xmath26 and lifetime @xmath27 , decays into a @xmath28 neutrino and a scalar particle : neutrino might decay into a electron neutrino which changes the neutron - proton ratio directly .",
    "however , in the present paper we do not consider this decay channel since the boltzmann equation for @xmath29 is too complicated .",
    "it is expected the emissions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 increase the neutron - proton ratio and tend to enhance the discrepancy between the bbn theory and the observation . ]",
    "@xmath31 where we assume that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are massless .",
    "the scalar particle may be a majoron  @xcite or a familon  @xcite and the decay modes are expected to be detected in the future experiments , cleo iii or b factories  @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the distribution @xmath34 of @xmath35-particle ( @xmath36 ) is written as  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale factor , @xmath39 is the momentum , and @xmath40s are collision terms which correspond to the three processes .",
    "the collision term @xmath41 for the decay process @xmath42 is given by  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the collision terms for the decay and the inverse decay processes , respectively .",
    "they are given by , @xmath46 the integration is performed between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the same way ,",
    "the collision terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 or @xmath32 , the spin factors are @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "for pair annihilation and creation processes @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ) , the collision terms are written as @xmath59 where k = @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the equilibrium distribution and @xmath63 is the differential cross sections given by @xmath64,\\ ] ] @xmath65 where @xmath66 is fermi coupling constant , and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 : weinberg angle ) for e@xmath69 and @xmath70 for neutrinos .",
    "we do not include the annihilation and creation process for the scalar particle @xmath32 assuming that their interaction is very week .    as for scattering processes",
    ", it is not easy to solve the boltzmann equations including the collision terms due to scattering because they are generally much more complicated than collision terms due to the annihilation and the decay . without scattering ,",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath0 neutrino is distorted because of the momentum dependence of the annihilation rate , which leads to overestimation of the density of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this effect is significant for the neutrino whose mass is larger than about 10mev since such heavy neutrino becomes non - relativistic before decoupling and its density decreases through annihilation processes . on the other hand , for neutrinos which are relativistic at decoupling epoch ,",
    "the momentum distributions do not change by the annihilation and is the same as the equilibrium one .",
    "thus the scattering process is important only for the heavy @xmath0 neutrino ( @xmath71mev ) .",
    "therefore we consider only the scattering process @xmath72 in the collision term of the boltzmann equation for @xmath25 .",
    "using non - relativistic approximation , the collision term is simplified as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are forward and backward reaction rates which are given by @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "the function @xmath80 is given by @xmath81    at t @xmath82 0.5 mev , electrons and positrons begin to annihilate and heat photons without heating neutrinos .",
    "then we have to deal with the temperature and cosmic time relation carefully . in this situation",
    ", we solve a set of boltzmann equations coupled with the hubble expansion rate and the entropy conservation equation .",
    "the hubble expansion rate is obtained by solving the einstein equation : @xmath83^{\\frac12},\\ ] ] and the entropy conservation is : @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 denotes the energy density of the particle `` @xmath35 '' ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 is the electron pressure .    as initial conditions we take @xmath88 where we assume that the scalar particle has been never thermalized and its cosmological density is negligible .",
    "we will discuss the justification of this assumption later .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the abundances of @xmath10 is sensitive to the total energy density of the universe during the bbn epoch , t = @xmath89 .",
    "the lower the energy density , the more slowly the universe expands , which leads to later decoupling of the weak interactions and less neutron - proton ratio .",
    "then the abundance of @xmath10 decreases since almost all neutrons are translated into @xmath10 .",
    "since the other light elements are insensitive to the cosmic expansion rate , it is expected that the bbn predictions may agree with observational data if the energy density of the universe becomes lower than the standard one by the effect of heavy @xmath0 neutrino decay .",
    "when we discuss the energy density of massive decaying @xmath0 neutrino , it is useful to introduce the effective number of neutrino species @xmath16 defined by @xmath90 the denominator is the energy density of a massless neutrino and @xmath16 is a constant ( = 3 ) in the standard model .    in fig .  1 we show the time evolutions of @xmath16 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "in order to understand their behaviors , it is convenient to introduce the three temperature scales , ( 1 ) the epoch when the decaying particle becomes non - relativistic @xmath93 , ( 2 ) the decaying particle s decoupling epoch @xmath94 , and ( 3 ) the epoch when the decay occurs @xmath95 . we define them by , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the hubble expansion rate , and",
    "@xmath98 is the effective lifetime of the @xmath0 neutrino .",
    "notice that the effective lifetime of the relativistic neutrino becomes longer than the proper lifetime because of the time dilation ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath100 sec and @xmath101 mev , the relation of the three time scales is given by @xmath102 . at temperatures between @xmath95 and @xmath103 the decay , inverse decay , annihilation and pair creation processes tend to establish the thermal equilibrium among three species of neutrinos and the scalar particle and @xmath16 becomes close to 3.6 .",
    "then , after decoupling , @xmath16 increases due to the mass effect until @xmath93 at which the inverse decay becomes suppressed and @xmath25 begins to decay efficiently . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath104 sec and @xmath105 , @xmath106 . between @xmath93 and @xmath103 the energy density of @xmath0 neutrino decrease due to the boltzmann suppression .",
    "after decoupling , the mass effect increases @xmath16 , and at @xmath107 @xmath25 begins to decay .",
    "thus , if @xmath108 , the increases of @xmath16 due to the mass effect is not significant and n@xmath109 becomes less than three as shown in fig .  1 for @xmath110 sec and @xmath111 mev .",
    "in a previous section , we have discussed the time evolution of the energy density in the universe , and have shown that @xmath0 neutrino with @xmath112 mass and short lifetime ( @xmath113 sec ) can reduce the effective number of neutrino species @xmath16 . in order to calculate the abundances of d , @xmath114 , and @xmath12",
    ", we incorporate the change of the effective number of neutrino species n@xmath109 into the big bang nucleosynthesis code  @xcite .    in the case of massive and unstable tau neutrino ,",
    "the effective number of neutrino species is a time - dependent variable .",
    "since only @xmath10 abundance is sensitive to n@xmath109 , if the predicted @xmath10 abundance is expressed by the corresponding ( constant ) number of neutrino species in the bbn calculation without massive neutrinos , it helps us to understand the results of our calculation intuitively .",
    "thus , we introduce the equivalent number of neutrino species @xmath115 here which is defined as @xmath116 in fig .  2 we show the contour plots of the equivalent number of neutrino species @xmath115 in the parameter space , @xmath117 . in this plot",
    "we expect that the predicted y@xmath118 decreases if @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    in the numerical calculation",
    "we make use of the monte carlo procedure in order to include the experimental uncertainties of the nuclear reaction rates and the neutron lifetime  @xcite .",
    "since the theoretical @xmath121 errors are almost independent of @xmath16 for @xmath122 , we adopt the @xmath121 errors estimated by the standard bbn ( @xmath17 ) calculation .",
    "the calculated abundances are compared with the primordial values inferred form the observational data . concerning the @xmath10",
    ", we adopt the value in the extra galactic hii region and it is given by  @xcite , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mass fraction of @xmath10 and `` p '' denotes the primordial value .",
    "it is believed that abundances of @xmath125li observed in the population ii metal poor halo stars in our galaxy represent the primordial values .",
    "we adopt the recent observational data  @xcite , @xmath126 for a deuterium abundance , we have some types of the measurements which are the local ism or the solar system data and the abundances observed in high red - shift qso absorption systems .",
    "the abundances inferred from the local ism are @xmath127  @xcite . in the solar system",
    "the observed deuterium abundances are @xmath128  @xcite .",
    "this pre - solar deuterium abundance is obtained by subtracting @xmath11/h value observed in carbonaceous chondorites from ( d + @xmath11)/h observed in the solar winds . from above abundances",
    ", we must extrapolate the true primordial deuterium abundance assuming appropriate chemical evolution models .",
    "on the other hand , the observations in high red - shift qso absorption systems are expected that they are nearly the primordial values because such lyman @xmath129 clouds would be unprocessed . in the last three years",
    ", more papers concerning these lyman limit system observations are published .",
    "however , two groups have measured different d / h values which disagree in a order of magnitude .",
    "the higher values measured by some persons are  @xcite , @xmath130 the lower values measured by burles and tytler .",
    "@xcite are , @xmath131    some chemical evolution models which predict only modest destruction of deuterium during the galaxy evolution have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "adopting such a recent model  @xcite which reports that the deuterium destruction is limited to a factor 3 or less , the above low deuterium values in high red - shift qso absorption systems would be consistent with the ism and solar system data . however , there are also the other models in which primordial deuterium can be significantly destroyed into a order of magnitude lower without over - producing the @xmath11  @xcite",
    ". the latter models might agree with the high deuterium abundance in high z qso absorption systems .",
    "considering the circumstances mentioned above , we so far have no conclusive model of the galactic chemical evolution . on the observational side , it is premature to determine which deuterium values in high red - shift qso absorption systems are reliable . therefore in this paper , we adopt both the high and low deuterium data in high z qso absorption systems and for each deuterium value we constrain on the @xmath0 neutrino mass and its lifetime .    in order to obtain the confidence level of the model parameters , mass @xmath26 , lifetime @xmath27 , and baryon to photon ratio @xmath19 in the universe , we utilize the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the likelihood function of theoretical abundances is taken to be gaussian which has the one sigma variance calculated by the monte carlo procedure .",
    "the likelihood function of observational data is taken to be gaussian for the statistical error , and to be top hat distribution for the systematic error ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also for the @xmath0 neutrino mass , the experimental bound eq .",
    "( [ experiment ] ) is incorporated as a gaussian distribution .",
    "the obtained two dimensional contours in the parameter space , @xmath117 , are shown in fig .  3 for using the low ( d / h)@xmath132 , and in fig .  4 for using the high ( d / h)@xmath132",
    ". in fig .  3 the contour with same likelihood as the standard bbn model ( n@xmath109 = 3 ) is shown by the dotted line",
    ". notice that if @xmath133 and @xmath23 , the theoretical predictions give a much better fit to the observational data than the standard bbn .",
    "the best fit values are estimated as @xmath134 for the low d abundances in the qso absorption systems .",
    "the filled square in fig .",
    "3 represents the best fit point . from fig .",
    "4 we can obtain the upper limit for the @xmath0 neutrino mass @xmath135 , @xmath136 for high d abundances in the qso absorption systems .",
    "in this paper we have shown the light element abundances which are predicted by bbn theory with @xmath0 neutrino whose mass is @xmath137mev and lifetime is @xmath113 sec .",
    "agree with the primordial values inferred by observational data even if we adopt the low d / h in high z qso absorption systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt the high d / h , we can obtain the strong constraints on @xmath0 neutrino mass @xmath138mev .",
    "finally we discuss the annihilation rate for the scalar particle @xmath32 . for this purpose",
    "we assume that @xmath32 is a majoron - like particle which has the interaction to @xmath25 as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the characteristic energy scale . in the relativistic limit",
    "the ratio of the annihilation rate for @xmath141 to hubble expansion rate is given by @xmath142 when the cosmic temperature @xmath143 is less than @xmath26 , the ratio @xmath144 .",
    "thus @xmath145 takes the maximum value at @xmath146 : @xmath147 the condition that the scalar particle @xmath32 is not in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath148 on the other hand , the lifetime of the @xmath0 neutrino is related to @xmath149 by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the mixing angle .",
    "therefore the condition ( [ phi - anni ] ) is written as @xmath152 from eq .",
    "( [ lifecrt ] ) the scalar particles are not in thermal equilibrium if @xmath153sec and @xmath154 .",
    "thus our assumption that the scalar particle has not been thermalized is justified when the mixing angle is large .",
