    "have been identified in the latest public data release ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "the photometric precision of sdss is unrivaled for a survey of its size , with typical errors @xmath9 0.02 mag @xcite .    when the conditions at apo were not photometric , sdss operated in a spectroscopic mode .",

    "the primary targets were galaxies @xcite and quasars @xcite .",
    "however , over @xmath6 70,000 m dwarfs have been identified within the sdss spectroscopic database @xcite from targeted and serendipitous ( i.e. , failed quasar ) observations .",
    "in the following section , the method and results of @xcite are detailed .",
    "the @xcite study produced two distinct yet intertwined results : it combined the investigation of an intrinsic stellar property ( the mf and lf ) with a measurement of galactic structure and self  consistently described the local low ",
    "mass stellar population .",
    "the wide , deep , precise photometric coverage of sdss enabled this type of analysis .",
    "previous investigations of the lf and mf have relied on one of two techniques : 1 ) nearby , volume  limited studies of trigonometric parallax stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or 2 ) pencil  beam surveys of distant stars over a small solid angle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases ,",
    "sample sizes were limited to a few thousand stars , prohibiting detailed statistical measurements . using a sample drawn from sdss , 2mass and guide star catalog photometry and supplemented with sdss spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite performed the largest field low  mass lf and mf investigation prior to the @xcite study . @xcite",
    "measured the lf with a sample covering 30 sq .",
    "deg .  and containing @xmath11 low  mass stars .",
    "they also constrained their contamination rate to @xmath9 a few percent after obtaining spectra of every red point source in a 1 sq .",
    "deg .  calibration region .",
    "please refer to @xcite for a detailed description of sample selection .",
    "m dwarfs were selected from sdss data release 6 ( dr6 ; * ? ? ? * ) footprint using @xmath12 and @xmath13 photometric colors .",
    "noisy photometric observations were removed using flag cuts , yielding a final database containing over 15 million low  mass stars .",
    "the @xcite photometric sample comprised a data set three orders of magnitude larger ( in number ) than any previous lf study .",
    "furthermore , it covered over 8,400 sq@xmath14 deg@xmath14 , nearly 300 times larger than the sample analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the large sky coverage of sdss presented the main challenge in measuring the lf .",
    "most previous studies either assumed a uniform density distribution ( for nearby stars ) or calculated a galactic density profile , @xmath15 along one line of sight . with millions of stars",
    "spread over nearly 1/4 of the sky , numerically integrating galactic density profiles for each star was computationally prohibitive .    to address this issue , @xcite employed the following technique for measuring the luminosity function .",
    "first , absolute magnitudes were assigned and distances to each star were computed using new @xmath16 and @xmath17 color  absolute magnitude relations ( cmrs ) estimated from nearby stars with @xmath7 photometry and accurate trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "next , a small range in absolute magnitude ( 0.5 mag ) was selected and the stellar density was measured as a function of galactic radius ( _ r _ ) and galactic height ( _ z _ ) .",
    "this range in absolute magnitude was selected to provide high resolution of the lf , with a large number of stars ( @xmath18 ) in each bin . finally , a galactic profile was fit to the @xmath19 density maps , solving for the shape of the thin and thick disks and the local stellar density .",
    "the lf was then constructed by combining the local density of each absolute magnitude slice .",
    "an example of one density map and the corresponding fit is shown in figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the measured `` raw '' lf is subject to various systematic effects .",
    "unresolved binarity , metallicity gradients within the milky way , interstellar extinction and malmquist bias can all influence a star s estimated absolute magnitude and distance .",
    "understanding these effects is important , since the photometric data set contains millions of stars and poisson errors are no longer significant within a given lf bin . rather , systematic errors in absolute magnitudes are the dominant source of uncertainty . in the @xcite study ,",
    "the uncertainty in each lf bin was calculated by repeating the entire analysis multiple times , using five different prescriptions for the cmr , which were selected to account for metallicity gradients , extinction and reddening .",
    "the effects of unresolved binarity and malmquist bias were quantified using monte carlo realizations of the milky way .",
    "each model was populated with synthetic systems that were consistent with the observed galactic structure and lf .",
    "binaries were included within the simulations , using four different prescriptions for mass ratio distributions .",
    "the mock stellar catalog was analyzed with the same pipeline as the actual observations .",
    "the differences between the input and `` observed '' galactic structure and lf were used to systematically correct the observed `` raw '' values from sdss data . the single ",
    "star lf was also estimated during this step .",
    "the detailed analysis of malmquist bias and unresolved binaries and their effect on the resultant lf are given in @xcite .",
    "the final adopted system and single ",
    "star @xmath20 lfs are presented in figure [ fig : lf_sing_system ] .",
    "the uncertainty in each lf bin was computed from the full spread due to differences among cmrs and binary prescriptions .",
    "the system lf ( black circles ) rises smoothly to @xmath21 , with a fall off to lower masses . the single ",
    "star lf ( red circles ) follows a similar track , but maintains a density increase of @xmath22 compared to the system lf at the same absolute magnitude .",
    "this implies that lower luminosity stars are easily hidden in binary systems , but isolated low  luminosity systems are not common .    using the mass  magnitude relations of , the field system and single ",
    "star lfs were converted to mfs , shown in figure [ fig : reid_zheng ] .",
    "the system mf exhibits similar behavior to the lf , peaking near 0.3 @xmath23 . the single ",
    "star mf is compared to the local `` eight parsec '' mf of @xcite in figure [ fig : reid_zheng ] .",
    "the @xcite sample consisted of 558 stars spread over 3@xmath24 steradians .",
    "there is broad agreement over most of the mass range probed , with the sdss mf falling below the local mf at higher masses .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to the assumed cmr , which may have overestimated the brightness of higher mass m dwarfs ( see contribution by hawley et al .",
    "this volume ; * ? ? ? * ) . to first order",
    ", this would lead to overestimated distances and underestimated local stellar densities .",
    "future investigations will rederive the lf and mf with updated cmrs .",
    "the sdss mf was fit with two functions : a broken power law and lognormal .",
    "both adequately represent the underlying data points , but a lognormal is slightly preferred due to the smaller number of free parameters .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : reid_zheng ] compares the sdss system mf with the mf reported by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite hst survey was a pencil beam survey of 1,400 m dwarfs over @xmath6 1 sq .  deg .. their system mf agrees with most of the sdss mf , especially at lower masses .",
    "the @xcite power law fit agrees favorably with the low  mass component of the sdss broken power law fit . at higher masses",
    ", there is a disagreement , which is likely due to cmr differences .",
    "when searching for variations between mfs , it is crucial that mf @xmath25 is compared , rather than best  fit functional forms .",
    "this point , first introduced in @xcite and reiterated by is important .",
    "the comparison of @xmath26 and not @xmath25 may have exaggerated the differences between the local census ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and distant samples ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although other factors , such as unresolved binarity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also contributed .",
    "finally , the sdss single - star mf is compared to selected seminal works in the field in figure [ fig : big_shots ] .",
    "while photometric studies can be used to study the distribution of m dwarfs throughout the galaxy and infer their fundamental properties , they offer a static glimpse of the population .",
    "the dynamics of stars through the milky way , as measured by radial velocities and proper motions , can be used to infer the underlying local mass distribution and gravitational potential . in particular , kinematic studies of m dwarfs",
    "have been useful for studying the properties of the thin and thick disks . using a sample of @xmath6 7,000",
    "m dwarfs along one line of sight , @xcite examined the @xmath27 velocity distributions as a function of distance from the plane .",
    "thin and thick disk components were identified with the use of probability plots @xcite . in general , both the thin and thick disks dispersions increase with height above the plane , with the @xmath28 velocity dispersion being the smallest of the three directions . low ",
    "mass stars follow the galactic potential across the entire mass range . in other words , early and late  type m dwarfs , despite differing in mass by nearly a factor of ten , have similar velocity dispersions at the same height from the galactic midplane .",
    "similar trends with height were also quantified by @xcite using proper motions and distances of @xmath6 2 million sdss m dwarfs .    the analysis from @xcite",
    "was expanded to the entire sdss footprint by @xcite , using the largest spectroscopic sample of m dwarfs ever assembled @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined mean velocities , dispersion and relative scalings between the thin and thick disk .",
    "they searched for velocity gradients radially in the disk , and observed a similar increase in dispersion away the plane ( see figure [ fig : disps ] ) .",
    "@xcite kinematically estimated the local fraction of thick disk stars to be @xmath29 , similar to the photometric result from @xcite .",
    "this study exemplifies the utility of low  mass stars as probes of the local milky way .",
    "in addition to their utility as tracers of the local milky way , low ",
    "mass dwarfs have intrinsic properties , such as chromospheric activity @xcite , that can be examined in a broader context .",
    "additionally , metallicity may be studied using subdwarfs @xcite , readily identified by their spectra , which show enhanced calcium hydride ( cah ) absorption .",
    "subdwarfs have been easily detected in large - scale surveys such as the sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of m dwarf chromospheric activity in a galactic context is described below .",
    "similar investigations were severely limited before the advent of large spectroscopic databases , such as sdss .",
    "it highlights the importance of studying m dwarfs in a broader context within the milky way , as their distributions within the galaxy may be used as a valuable constraint on intrinsic properties .",
    "low  mass stars harbor strong magnetic dynamos @xcite , which in turn heat their chromospheres , producing balmer line emission . for early - type stars ( m0-m4 ) ,",
    "the dynamos are probably powered by stellar rotation , but the driving mechanism at later types is not well known .",
    "ca h @xmath30 k emission is also a tracer of activity in m dwarfs @xcite , but is often not observationally accessible for these dim , red stars . prior to sdss , surveys that measured the fraction of active m dwarfs often consisted of @xmath31 1000 stars , with very few stars ( @xmath32 ) in the faintest luminosity bins @xcite . since previous samples were flux ",
    "limited , they were heavily biased towards observing nearby , young stars .",
    "the first major study of activity in m dwarfs with sdss data was performed by @xcite .",
    "this study observed many stars at distances 5 - 10 times larger than previous studies due to the multi - fiber capabilities of the sdss spectrographs .",
    "the differences between the @xcite study and the past surveys were immediately obvious .",
    "first , some spectral types ( m7 and m8 ) which were previously observed to have active fractions near 100@xmath33 had lower active fractions , near 70@xmath33 .",
    "the active fraction distributions for all spectral types declined with distance from the galactic midplane with a spectral type dependent slope .",
    "@xcite suggested this was an age effect , as stars further from the plane also exhibited larger velocity dispersions .",
    "thus , older stars have undergone more dynamic interactions and also possess weaker magnetic fields .",
    "the m dwarf age - activity relation was calibrated by @xcite , which determined the activity lifetime for m dwarfs as a function of spectral type . by using a simple model that fit both the velocity and active fraction distributions within the galaxy",
    ", @xcite were able to constrain the ages of stars , a fundamental stellar property .",
    "it is worth noting that without large samples of m dwarfs , such as those available with sdss , this type of analysis would not be possible .",
    "the @xcite study also highlights the potential biases that are encountered when limiting samples to the solar neighborhood .",
    "the sun is very close to the midplane ( 15 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nearby stars are predominately young , biasing local samples .",
    "current models of low  mass stars can not accurately reproduce observable features .",
    "this has led to uncertainty in determining fundamental parameters , such as mass , age and luminosity .",
    "thus , empirical relations have been developed to estimate these properties .",
    "magnitude relations determined from eclipsing binaries , have proven extremely useful , but other fundamental parameters , most notably age and metallicity have not been fully calibrated .",
    "recent advances in measuring metallicity are promising ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and see the review of the metallicity splinter session in this volume ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite have calibrated an infrared technique that delivers 0.15 dex precision from @xmath34 band spectra . however , for the vast majority of m dwarfs with optical spectra , a similar level of precision has not been achieved . further observations of m dwarfs with known metallicities",
    "( i.e. , those in wide binaries with fgk companions ( i.e. , * ? ? ? * ) or cluster members ) need to be obtained before a suitable calibration can be determined",
    ". however , once precise metallicities can be measured for m dwarfs , they will be a powerful probe of the milky way s chemical history .",
    "age is notoriously difficult to estimate for field stars ( of any mass ) .",
    "however , age  activity relations ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest that observational tracers , such as chromospheric activity , can constrain the ages of m dwarfs to a few gyr .",
    "further work is needed to produce precise estimates of m dwarf ages .",
    "the next generation of synoptic surveys , such as lsst and panstarrs may be useful in this endeavor and provide a link between rotation periods and stellar age .",
    "i have briefly detailed some of the investigations that examine both intrinsic m dwarf properties and galactic structure and kinematics .",
    "the requisite data for such studies , namely precise , deep , multi - band photometry over large areas of the sky , will become more common in the future , as additional large surveys come online . within the next decade",
    ", surveys such as panstarrs , lsst and gaia , will produce new data sets that are ideal for similar investigations .    while databases containing millions of low  mass stars will be the norm for future studies , it is important to note that systematic errors will be the dominant source of error in many areas . in sdss",
    ", nearly all the observed m dwarfs do not have reliable trigonometric parallaxes , forcing the use of photometric parallax estimates . reliably calibrating and testing these photometric parallaxes",
    "will only become more important as surveys push to larger distances .",
    "other systematics , such as how metallicity affects the absolute magnitude of m dwarfs , will also be crucial to future investigations .",
    "finally , the importance of sdss spectroscopy can not be overstated .",
    "the large spectroscopic samples of sdss m dwarfs have enabled many novel investigations .",
