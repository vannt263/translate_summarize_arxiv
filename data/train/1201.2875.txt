    "recent determinations of the photospheric abundance give @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite ( on a logarithmic scale where @xmath1 ) , in near - agreement with the meteoritic abundance , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the iron abundance in the corona has been determined from x - ray or extreme ultraviolet fe emission lines , formed by collisional excitation .",
    "as the excitation rates are a function of electron temperature @xmath8 , the thermal structure of the emitting coronal plasma must be modeled for correct interpretation of line fluxes , and ionization fractions and excitation rate coefficients must be known .",
    "examples of the coronal fe abundance include @xcite ( @xmath9 ) , @xcite ( 7.65 ) , @xcite ( 8.19 ) , and @xcite ( 7.86 ) , i.e. enhancement factors over the photospheric value of between 1.4 and 4.9 .",
    "this large range of abundance determinations may indicate time variations in the coronal abundance @xcite or measurement uncertainties of @xmath10 in @xmath3 .",
    "the fe abundance from solar energetic particles ( seps ) in the interplanetary medium varies by large factors ; a baseline list of abundances for gradual events @xcite gives @xmath11 , or 2.65 times photospheric .",
    "evidence for systematic differences between photospheric and coronal abundances has been cited by @xcite and @xcite . according to @xcite elements with first ionization potential fip @xmath12",
    "ev like fe have coronal abundances enhanced by factors of 4 , apart from low - altitude flares and energetic spray - like events for which the coronal and photospheric abundances are equal .",
    "various models have been put forward to explain the fractionation and its dependence on fip ; they generally involve a mechanism that separates ions and neutral atoms in the chromosphere where low - fip elements are partly ionized but high - fip elements are neutral .",
    "the mechanisms include magnetic fields carrying ions rising into the corona as active regions develop @xcite , and the presence of a ponderomotive force in the acceleration of alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "flare spectra in the photon energy range @xmath13  kev to 17  mev have been obtained from the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ) since its launch on 2002 february  5 , allowing analysis of thermal spectra ( range @xmath1430  kev ) with @xmath15  kev spectral resolution ( fwhm ) .",

    "spectra , and from these the iron abundance estimated using models for the thermal structure ( isothermal or simple functions for the temperature distribution ) .",
    "this was done for _ rhessi _ spectra taken during various phases of 27 flares between 2002 and 2005 @xcite using fluxes of the fe line complex at 6.65  kev expressed as the equivalent width of nearby continuum .",
    "the observed equivalent widths were found to follow a dependence on @xmath8 , derived from the energy dependence of the continuum emission , approximately equal to the theoretical dependence with an fe abundance somewhat less than @xcite s coronal value , @xmath22 . in this work , this analysis is carried further .",
    "first , we have chosen only spectra during the gradual phases of flares with the _ rhessi _ thin attenuators in place , and secondly we have used advances in the analysis software enabling _ rhessi _ spectra to be better interpreted , including the use of the chianti code ( v.  6 ) @xcite with latest atomic data instead of the earlier mekal code @xcite .",
    "also , instrumental effects can be adjusted in the fitting process . by these means , we derive an estimate of the fe abundance with much reduced uncertainties compared with previous work .",
    "the _ rhessi _ spectrometer has been described by @xcite so only an outline is given here .",
    "nine cryogenically cooled hyper - pure germanium detectors make up the spectrometer , each with a 1-cm - thick front segment which senses low - energy x - rays .",
    "modulation collimators in front of each detector result in time - modulated counting rates as the spacecraft rotates , which are unscrambled with imaging software to form images .",
    "the x - ray emission is viewed through and partially absorbed by beryllium windows and aluminized mylar insulation layers . to avoid detector saturation and to reduce pulse pile - up , sets of aluminum attenuators are moved in front of the detectors at increasing x - ray flux levels . since instrumental effects like pile - up , slight changes in energy calibration at high count rates , and variable background rates are different for each detector , we chose to analyze spectra from the detector with best energy resolution rather than summing counts from multiple detectors to improve statistics . following our earlier work @xcite , we selected flare spectra during times of slowly decaying emission in the a1 state ( thin attenuators in place ) when the flare plasma is most nearly isothermal .",
    "spectral fits were done over a range from @xmath23  kev ( the count rates at lower energies are dominated by k - escape events in the a1 and a3 attenuator states ) up to 2040  kev , depending on the emission at higher energies relative to the background spectrum .",
    "thick - target x - ray continuum from a power - law electron spectrum was included when necessary to achieve an acceptable fit to the data at the higher energies .",
    "the energy bins for the spectral fits were those @xmath24  kev - wide bins used by the on - board pulse - height analyzer .",
    "twenty flares having a steady decline of x - ray emission were observed by _ rhessi _ between 2002 and 2005 in its a1 attenuator state during the @xmath25-minute solar - viewing part of its orbit . for two long - duration flares ( on 2002 july 20/21 and july 26/27 )",

    "the total of all flares for the fe line and fe / ni line complexes is shown in figure  [ line_flux_allflares ] .",
    "there is a clear trend for the values of flux divided by emission measure to be below the coronal @xmath148 curves by a constant factor for the fe line complex , suggesting ( as with the chianti@xmath28full analysis ) that the fe abundance is smaller than the @xcite value , but larger than the photospheric value .",
    "for the fe / ni line complex , the trend is similar at high temperatures ( @xmath149  mk , but the points become steadily higher than the coronal abundance curve for decreasing temperatures .",
    "this may be because of the instrumental line at @xmath19  kev mentioned earlier .",
    "figure  [ fe_abund_hist ] shows the distribution of fe abundance values for spectra during all flares lumped together for the fe line and fe / ni line complexes , with best - fit gaussian curves .",
    "the mean value of @xmath3 is @xmath93 from the fe line , @xmath150 from the fe / ni line complex . the larger fe abundance and larger uncertainty from the fe / ni line reflects the departure of the points from the theoretical @xmath128 curve , so",
    "the fe abundance from the fe line complex is clearly the preferred value .",
    "we note that the continuum in this analysis has a small contribution from fe emission , so there is a slight dependence on the coronal abundances used , which was the @xcite set .",
    "use of an fe abundance @xmath117 instead of @xmath133 , if the elements si , s , ca , and ni remain at their coronal values , should lead to emission measures that are @xmath14% larger .",
    "( 1 ) indicates that the derived value of @xmath143 and therefore the fe abundance using the chianti@xmath28cont emission model with coronal abundances for the continuum will be too large by 6% ( 0.03 in the logarithm ) .",
    "the abundance variation from flare to flare , in spite of the factor - of-100 range in the _ goes _ x - ray importance and _ rhessi _ count rates , is very small and well within the standard deviations for each flare .",
    "our analysis of _ rhessi _ solar flare spectra gives estimates of the fe abundance from two different emission models , chianti@xmath28full ( continuum and lines as given by the chianti atomic code ) and chianti@xmath28cont ( continuum given by chianti , fe and fe / ni line complexes at 6.65  kev and 8  kev separately fitted ) .",
    "both methods give fe abundance values that are constant to within the estimated uncertainties and higher than those derived from the photosphere or meteorites .",
    "the chianti@xmath28full analysis was found to suffer from poor fits to the spectral region around the fe / ni line complex at 8  kev , leading to generally higher values of @xmath107 . using only spectral fits with @xmath123",
    ", we found from 18 time intervals that the mean @xmath3 to be @xmath151 , the uncertainty being in the mean values for each of the 18 intervals .",
    "the chianti@xmath28cont analysis has the advantage that the fe and fe / ni line complexes can be fitted separately and @xmath3 can be derived for each .",
    "the possible presence of an instrumental line at @xmath19  kev adds to the observed fe / ni line complex and so the measured flux is an upper limit to the solar value .",
    "this probably explains the 23% difference between the values @xmath0 for the fe line during 25 time intervals and @xmath152 for the fe / ni line during 21 time periods , though the fe / ni line complex is also a much weaker feature .",
    "when all the chianti@xmath28cont observations are lumped together ( figures  [ line_flux_allflares ] and [ fe_abund_hist ] ) , it is clear , particularly from the fe line , that the fe abundance is constant to within estimated uncertainties from flare to flare .",
    "the distribution of all the estimates from the fe line leads to an fe abundance given by @xmath0 , which is our preferred value .",
    "our value is higher by a factor @xmath2 than fe abundance estimates from the photosphere ( e.g. @xmath153 : @xcite ) and by a factor @xmath154 than those from meteorites ( @xmath155 : @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is lower than those given for coronal plasmas , which range from 7.65 @xcite to 8.19 @xcite ; it is a factor @xmath156 lower than that given by @xcite and @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath22 , which is used as the coronal abundance set in chianti .",
    "the preliminary results for flares observed with the xrs instrument on mercury messenger @xcite give an fe abundance that is a factor 2.3 times photospheric @xcite , i.e. @xmath157 , which is consistent with our preferred value .",
    "our value is within @xmath126 of the fe abundance of table  2 of @xcite , @xmath158 , for their  hybrid \" abundance model , taking account of the uncertainties in both our value and the hybrid model .",
    "our value of @xmath93 is in very close agreement ( 0.02 less ) with the energetic particle abundances reported by @xcite for gradual events , viz .",
    "@xmath159 , suggesting a relationship of the fractionation process involved in the formation of hot flare plasmas and the acceleration of solar energetic particles .",
    "the constancy of the _ rhessi _ fe abundance estimates points to fractionation processes in flares , at least their declining stages , to be similar to those for the quiet sun .",
    "it is rather against expectations , as discussed by @xcite , who state that  the degree of chemical separation varies significantly , being more severe in regions of higher solar activity . \"",
    "though our measurements are during the decay of flares , the flare plasma is unlikely to be mixed with other plasma after the impulsive stage when ( as is widely accepted ) chromospheric evaporation occurs .",
    "if the fe abundance derived here for flares is representative of the quiet solar corona and active - region levels , there are consequences for the radiation loss curve ( figure  [ rad_loss ] ) .",
    "iron ions are an important emitter for solar plasmas in the temperature range spanning values of the quiet corona to the tens of mk of solar flares .",
    "a maximum in radiation loss at @xmath15  mk is due to emission lines of  between 171    and 284   , and a second maximum at @xmath160  mk is due to  x - ray lines .",
    "the precise abundance of iron is therefore important for studies of the energy balance in quiet coronal or flare loops , particularly for higher densities when radiation loss may dominate conduction losses @xcite .",
    "if the value obtained here , @xmath117 , applies to all coronal plasmas with temperatures 120  mk , the radiation loss curve will be correspondingly modified .",
    "figure  [ rad_loss ] shows the radiation loss for optically thin plasma with this temperature range and for fe abundances with photospheric and coronal values including our own .",
    "the contribution from fe ions and hydrogen alone is also shown , with maxima at @xmath15  mk and @xmath160  mk .",
    "( the maximum at @xmath161  k is due to ly-@xmath17 emission of hydrogen . )",
    "the radiation loss is less for a photospheric fe abundance than a coronal fe abundance by a factor @xmath162 for quiet coronal loops ( @xmath163  mk ) and a factor @xmath164 for flare loops with @xmath165  mk .",
    "for @xmath117 obtained in this work , the radiation loss is less than that for coronal fe abundance @xcite by a factor 0.8 ( @xmath163  mk ) and 0.72 ( @xmath165  mk ) .",
    "the radiation loss curve approximated by @xcite with a piece - wise continuous temperature - dependent form assumed abundances that are twice those of @xcite ; as @xcite gives @xmath166 for the corona , the @xcite value ( 7.9 ) is very nearly the one obtained here .",
    "the various models advanced up to the mid-1990s for explaining the fip effect have been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "fractionation according to the first ionization potential is generally explained by the fact that low - fip ( fip @xmath12  ev ) elements are partly ionized in the photosphere but high - fip elements are predominantly neutral .",
    "it is difficult to obtain from any of these early models a quantitative enhancement of low - fip elements in coronal plasmas , however , and it appears to be a feature of the present work that for flares with a range of x - ray importance that the enhancement of fe is a particular value , constant from flare to flare .",
    "the constancy of the fe abundance in flare plasmas is also consistent with the analysis of 2795 resik spectra indicating a constant enhancement ( of a factor 5 over the photospheric abundance ) of potassium in flares @xcite and an argon abundance that is also constant ( in this case to within 20% of photospheric ar abundance proxies @xcite ) .",
    "the more recent fip model of laming @xcite involves the ponderomotive force that arises when alfvn waves pass from the chromosphere to the corona , and definite predictions about the enhancements of various elements can be made according to the dimensions of the coronal loop that the waves are incident on , its magnetic field , and the wave intensity .",
    "a particular example is given for a loop with length of 100,000  km and field strength of 7  g. _ rhessi _ flare loops are likely to be much shorter , but it is interesting that for a fairly wide range of wave energy fluxes the coronal enhancement of fe is between 2 and 3 , as obtained in this work .    in a wider context , it has been found that the occurrence of giant planets around stars depends sensitively on metallicity , specifically the fe abundance @xcite .",
    "this refers to fe abundances in the stellar photospheres .",
    "however , it would be interesting to use the methods of this work to derive the coronal or flare abundance of fe from the 6.65  kev line feature and compare with photospheric abundances to see if there are correlations of the difference with the probability of planet formation .",
