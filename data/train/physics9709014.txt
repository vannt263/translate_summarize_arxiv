    "in computed tomography ( ct ) , three dimensional reconstruction techniques from projection have been used for many years in radiology .",
    "the two dimensional fourier transform is the most commonly used algorithm in radiology . in this technique",
    "a large number of projections at uniformly distributed angles around the subject are required for reconstruction of the image . in the field of accelerator physics",
    ", one expects that the relatively simple charged particle beam distributions can be reconstructed from a small number of projections . in conventional practice",
    "only two projections , usually horizontal and vertical , are measured .",
    "this puts a severe limit on the level of detail that can be achieved .",
    "the algebraic reconstruction technique ( art ) introduced by gordan , bender and herman @xcite uses three or more projections to reconstruct the 2-dimensional beam density distribution .",
    "they have shown that the improvement in the quality of the reconstruction is pronounced when a third projection is added , but additional projections add much less to the reconstruction quality .",
    "the art algorithms have a simple intuitive basis .",
    "each projected density is thrown back across the reconstruction space in which the densities are iteratively modified to bring each reconstructed projection into agreement with the measured projection . assuming that the pattern being reconstructed is enclosed in a square space of n x n array of small pixels , @xmath0 is grayness or density number , which is uniform within the pixel but different from other pixels .",
    "a `` ray '' is a region of the square space which lies between two parallel lines .",
    "the weighted ray sum is the total grayness of the reconstruction figure within the ray .",
    "the projection at a given angle is then the sum of non - overlapping , equally wide rays covering the figure .",
    "the art algorithm consists of altering the grayness of each pixel intersected by the ray in such a way as to make the ray sum agree with the corresponding element of the measured projection .",
    "assume * p is a matrix of m x n@xmath1 and the m component column vector * r. let @xmath2 denote the ( i , j)th element of * p , and @xmath3 denote the ith ray of the reconstructed projection vector * r. for @xmath4 , n@xmath5 is number of pixels under projection ray r@xmath5 , defined as @xmath6 .",
    "art is an iterative method .",
    "the density number @xmath7 denotes the value of @xmath8 after q iterations .",
    "after q iterations the intensity of the ith reconstructed projection ray is @xmath9 and the density in each pixel is @xmath10 where r@xmath5 is the measured projection ray and , @xmath11 and , @xmath12 this algorithm is known as fully constrained art . * * * *    it is necessary to determine when an iterative algorithm has converged to a solution which is optimal according to some criterion .",
    "various criteria for convergence have been devised .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured and calculated projection elements is @xmath13 and the nonuniformity or variance of constructed figure is @xmath14 and the entropy constructed figure is @xmath15 @xmath16 tends to zero , @xmath17 to a minimum and @xmath18 to a maximum with increasing q. for a known test pattern ( @xmath19 ) , the euclidean distance is define as @xmath20",
    "it is instructive to test the reconstruction capabilities of art with two to four views by using projections from a known test figure . in the following example , we have used an x - y coupled ( about 18@xmath21 ) two - dimensional gaussian enclosed in a square space of 100 x 100 array with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we have used a ray width in the 45@xmath21 and 135@xmath21 projection as @xmath24 times of ray width in x or y projection , making number of ray in each projection same namely 100 .",
    "1 shows the test figure and reconstructed test figure from two projections .",
    "2 shows reconstructed test figure from three and four projections .",
    "3 shows the contours of figures 1 and 2 .    .",
    "the convergence criteria discrepancy ( d ) , variance ( v ) , the entropy ( e ) and the euclidean distance ( s ) for two , three and four projections . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that two projections are not enough for catching the coupling .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstructed figure from four projection is slightly better than three projections .",
    "4 shows the discrepancy ( d ) , variance ( v ) , the entropy ( e ) and the euclidean distance ( s ) as a function of iteration number for case of three projections .",
    "the convergence criteria was if discrepancy is less than 10@xmath25 .",
    "table 1 show the numerical values of discrepancy ( d ) , variance ( v ) , the entropy ( e ) and the euclidean distance ( s ) for two , three and four projections .",
    "there are stepping wire profile scanners at 13 locations throughout the 200 mev linac and transport lines .",
    "these scanners are mounted at a 45@xmath21 angle with respect to horizontal , and single horizontal and vertical wires are stepped through the bea we have added a third wire at 45@xmath21 to horizontal in two of the scanners , one in the 750 kev line @xcite and one in the 200 mev blip @xcite transport line .",
    "5 shows a schematic of the scanner with three wires .",
    "7 shows beam density contour plots in the blip line .",
    "the x - y coupling is clearly seen .",
    "this coupling could come from one or more rotated quadrupoles or vertical beam offset in a dipole . in the presence of x - y coupling ,",
    "the usual technique of emittance measurement from profiles at three or more locations will not work .",
