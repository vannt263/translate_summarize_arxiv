    "in the present work we studied the anisotropy of the spin polarization in a narrow nanowire quantum dot in the presence of so coupling . solving three - dimensional schrdinger equation we showed that the strength of the spin polarization in the presence of rashba so interaction depends on the orientation of the magnetic field and there are hard and easy spin polarization axes .",
    "we explained the existence of these axes by the intrinsic tendency of so coupling to polarize spins in the direction perpendicular to the nanowire .",

    "<S> one and two - electron systems confined in a single and coupled quantum dots defined within a nanowire with a finite radius are studied in the context of spin - orbit coupling effects . </S>",
