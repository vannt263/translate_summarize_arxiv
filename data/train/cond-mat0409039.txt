    "in general one would expect corrections to scaling so , e.g , @xmath43\\ ] ] in addition to `` analytic '' corrections to scaling of the form @xmath44 , there are `` non - analytic '' corrections to scaling of the form @xmath45 , where the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath46 is nt an integer .",
    "in fact one would expect a whole sequence of correction - to - scaling exponents @xmath47 , which are both universal and also independent of the observable , that is , the same for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and so on . in a recent paper @xcite we study the amplitudes and the correction - to - scaling exponents for two - dimensional saws , using a combination of series - extrapolation and monte carlo methods .",
    "we enumerated all self - avoiding walks up to 59 steps on the square lattice , and up to 40 steps on the triangular lattice , measuring the metric properties mentioned above , and then carried out a detailed and careful analysis of the data in order to accurately estimate the amplitudes and correction - to - scaling exponent .",
    "the analysis provides firm numerical evidence that @xmath48 as predicted by nienhuis @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a detailed account of the algorithm used to calculate the triangular lattice series analysed in @xcite , perform some further analysis of the series and confirm to great accuracy the predicted exact values of the critical exponents , then we briefly summarise the results of the analysis from @xcite and finally study other amplitude combinations .",
    "the use of transfer - matrix methods for the enumeration of lattice objects has its origin in the pioneering work of enting @xcite who enumerated square lattice self - avoiding polygons using the finite lattice method .",
    "the basic idea of the finite lattice method is to calculate partial generating functions for various properties of a given model on finite pieces , say @xmath49 rectangles of the square lattice , and then reconstruct a series expansion for the infinite lattice limit by combining the results from the finite pieces .",
    "the generating function for any finite piece is calculated using transfer matrix ( tm ) techniques .",
    "the algorithm we use to enumerate saws and saps on the triangular lattice builds on this approach and more specifically our algorithm is based in large part on the one devised by enting and guttmann @xcite for the enumeration of saps on the triangular lattice with the generalisation to saws following the work of conway , enting and guttmann @xcite and using further recent enhancements and parallelisation as described in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we give a detailed description of the saw algorithm and then briefly outline the changes required to enumerate saps .     a snapshot of the boundary line ( dashed line ) during the transfer matrix calculation on the triangular lattice .",
    "saws are enumerated by successive moves of the kink in the boundary line so that one vertex ( shaded ) at a time is added to the rectangle . to the left of the boundary line",
    "we have drawn an example of a partially completed saw . ]",
    "we implement the triangular lattice as a square lattice with additional edges connecting the top - left and bottom - right vertices of each unit cell ( see fig  [ fig : transfer ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath49 rectangles as our finite lattices .",
    "the most efficient implementation of the tm algorithm generally involves bisecting the finite lattice with a boundary ( this is just a line in the case of rectangles ) and moving the boundary in such a way as to build up the lattice cell by cell .",
    "the sum over all contributing graphs is calculated as the boundary is moved through the lattice . due to the symmetry of the triangular lattice",
    "we need only consider rectangles with @xmath50 .",
    "saws in a given rectangle are enumerated by moving the intersection so as to add one vertex at a time , as shown in figure  [ fig : transfer ] . in most cases",
    "it is most efficient to let the boundary line cut through the edges of the lattice .",
    "however , on the triangular lattice it is more efficient to let the boundary line cut through the vertices @xcite .",
    "essentially this variation leads to only half as many intersected vertices ( as opposed to edges ) along the boundary line . for each configuration of occupied or empty vertices along the intersection",
    "we maintain a generating function for partial walks cutting the intersection in that particular pattern .",
    "if we draw a saw and then cut it by a line we observe that the partial saw to the left of this line consists of a number of loops connecting two vertices ( we shall refer to these vertices as loop - ends ) in the intersection , and pieces which are connected to only one vertex ( we call these free ends ) .",
    "the other end of the free piece is an end point of the saw so there are at most two free ends .",
    "in addition it is possible that the saw touches a vertex ( that is the saw comes in along one edge and exits along another edge both without crossing the boundary line ) .",
    "all these cases are illustrated in figure  [ fig : transfer ] . in applying the transfer matrix technique to the enumeration of saws",
    "we regard them as sets of edges on the finite lattice with the properties :    * a weight @xmath51 is associated with an occupied edge .",
    "* all vertices are of degree 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "* there are at most two vertices of degree 1 and the final graph has exactly two vertices of degree 1 ( the end points of the saw ) . *",
    "apart from isolated sites , the final graph has a single connected component .",
    "* each graph must span the rectangle from left to right and from bottom to top .",
    "we are not allowed to form closed loops , so two loop - ends can only be joined if they belong to different loops . to exclude loops which close on themselves we need to label the occupied vertices in such a way that we can easily determine whether or not two loop - ends belong to the same loop .",
    "the most obvious choice would be to give each loop a unique label .",
    "however , on two - dimensional lattices there is a more compact scheme relying on the fact that two loops can never intertwine .",
    "each end of a loop is assigned one of two labels depending on whether it is the lower end or the upper end of a loop .",
    "each configuration along the boundary line can thus be represented by a set of states @xmath52 , where    @xmath53    if we read from the bottom to the top , the configuration along the intersection of the partial saw in figure  [ fig : transfer ] is @xmath54 .",
    "the seven possible outputs from a single iteration of the tm algorithm . depending on the states of the three vertices @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in the input",
    "some of the outputs can not occur . ]    in figure[fig : tmit ] we have illustrated what can happen locally as the boundary line is moved . before the move , the boundary line intersects the vertices @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 and after the move the vertices @xmath55 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 are intersected by the boundary line .",
    "we shall refer to the boundary line configuration prior to a move as the ` source ' and after the move as the ` target ' . in a basic iteration step",
    "we can insert bonds along the edges emanating from vertex @xmath56 .",
    "since vertex @xmath56 ca nt have degree greater than 2 we can at most insert two new bonds . however , depending on the states of vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 in the source , some of the edge configuration in figure  [ fig : tmit ] may be forbidden .",
    "the updating of the partial generating function depends most crucially on the state of vertex @xmath56 and to a somewhat lesser extent on the states of the vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "the basic limitation on the allowed outputs are that conditions ( 2)(4 ) must be enforced . in the following",
    "we shall briefly describe how the updating rules are derived .",
    "* state of vertex @xmath59 is 0 .",
    "* since vertex @xmath56 is empty all the outputs in figure  [ fig : tmit ] are possible . in the first output we insert no bonds .",
    "this is always allowed and no changes are made to the configuration .    in the next three outputs we insert a single bond .",
    "this makes vertex @xmath56 of degree one and is thus only allowed if there is at most one free end in the source .",
    "there are further restrictions on the insertion of a bond to vertices @xmath55 or @xmath57 .",
    "firstly if a vertex is touched ( in state 3 ) we can not insert a bond since this would result in a vertex of degree 3 .",
    "secondly if the vertex is a free end ( in state 4 ) we join two free ends .",
    "this leads to the formation of a completed sub - graph and is only permitted if the resulting graph is a valid saw .",
    "so the configuration can not contain other pieces of a saw and the only permissible states of other vertices in the intersection are 0 and 3 .",
    "if a valid saw is created we multiply the source generating function by @xmath51 ( representing the new bond ) before adding it to the total for the saw generating function .    in the last three outputs we insert a partial loop .",
    "again there are restrictions on the insertion of bonds to vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 . as before we can not insert a bond to a vertex in state 3 .",
    "otherwise the first two outputs are always allowed .",
    "the last output is a little more complicated .",
    "if both vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 are in state 4 we join two free ends and as before we check if the result is a valid saw and if so add this partial generating function the saw generating function ( this time we multiply the source generating function by @xmath60 ) .",
    "if vertex @xmath55 is in state 1 and vertex @xmath57 in state 2 we can not join the two vertices since this would result in a closed loop .    after the insertion of new bonds we have to assign a state to vertex @xmath58 and quite possibly change the states of vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 ( and perhaps the states of some other vertices in the target configuration )",
    ". the state of vertex @xmath58 will be 0 ( no bond ) , 1 ( lower loop - end ) , 2 ( upper loop - end ) or 4 ( free end ) .",
    "next we consider what happens to vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "when these vertices are empty in the source they can take the values just listed above in the target .",
    "if they are occupied in the source they either retain their state in the target ( no bonds inserted ) or change to state 3 ( a bond is inserted ) . in the latter case we may have to change the state of other vertices in the target .",
    "if we insert a free end and it joins a lower ( upper ) loop - end we must change the matching upper ( lower ) loop - end to a free end . otherwise we may join two lower ( upper ) loop - ends and then we must change the matching upper ( lower ) loop - end of the inner most loop to the lower ( upper ) loop - end of the new joined loop .    *",
    "state of vertex @xmath59 is 1 . *",
    "a lower end of a loop enters vertex @xmath56 .",
    "if we insert no further bonds a new degree 1 vertex is created . as above this",
    "is only allowed provided the source has at most one free end .",
    "the matching upper loop - end becomes a free end .",
    "otherwise the lower end has to be continued by inserting a single bond ( partial loops can not be inserted since this would make vertex @xmath56 of degree 3 ) either to vertex @xmath58 which becomes a state 1 vertex ; to vertex @xmath55 if not in state 3 or state 2 ( closed loop would be formed ) ; or to vertex @xmath57 if not in state 3 .",
    "again we have to change the states of vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 when a bond is inserted on these vertices .",
    "if the source state of the vertices was 0 the target state becomes 1 , otherwise the target state becomes 3 and as above we may need to change the state of other vertices as well .    *",
    "state of vertex @xmath59 is 2 . *",
    "an upper end of a loop enters vertex @xmath56 .",
    "if we terminate the loop - end a new degree 1 vertex is created .",
    "again this is only allowed provided the source has at most one free end .",
    "the matching lower end of the loop becomes a free end .",
    "the upper end can always be continued to vertex @xmath58 ; to vertex @xmath57 if it is not in state 3 ; and to vertex @xmath55 provided it is not in state 3 or 1 ( this would result in a closed loop ) .",
    "the state of the target vertices are changed as described above .",
    "* state of vertex @xmath59 is 3 .",
    "* this is the simplest situation .",
    "vertex @xmath56 is of degree 2 so no bonds can be inserted and only the output with all empty edges is allowed .",
    "the state of vertex @xmath58 is 0 and the states of all other vertices are unchanged .",
    "* state of vertex @xmath59 is 4 .",
    "* a free end is entering vertex @xmath56 .",
    "if we insert no further bonds a partial walk is terminated at the vertex .",
    "this is only allowed if the resulting graph is a valid saw and the source generating function is added to the saw generating function .",
    "the free end can always be continued to vertex @xmath58 and to vertices @xmath55 and @xmath57 if they are not in state 3 .",
    "as before , if we join two free ends we check if it is a valid saw and then add the partial generating function ( multiplied by @xmath51 ) to the saw generating function .",
    "otherwise the target configuration is updated as described previously .",
    "[ [ sap - updating - rules . ] ] sap updating rules .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the updating rules used when enumerating saps are essentially just a subset of the saw rules .",
    "obviously there are no degree 1 vertices in the sap case so we ca nt insert a single bond if vertex @xmath56 is empty . likewise",
    "if vertex @xmath56 is occupied we must continue the loop - end .",
    "completed saps are formed by closing a loop ( if there are no other loop - ends in the source ) .",
    "this happens when the local source configuration @xmath61 is @xmath62 and we insert a bond from @xmath56 to @xmath55 , @xmath63 and we insert a partial loop from @xmath55 through @xmath56 to @xmath57 , or @xmath64 and we insert a bond from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the use of _ pruning _ to obtain more efficient tm algorithms was used for square lattice saps in @xcite .",
    "numerically it was found that the computational complexity was close to @xmath65 , much better than the @xmath66 of the original approach .",
    "we have used similar techniques for the enumerations carried out for this paper .",
    "pruning allows us to discard most of the possible configurations for large @xmath67 because they only contribute at lengths greater than @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is the maximal length to which we choose to carry out our calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is limited by the available computational resources , be they cpu time or physical memory . briefly pruning works as follows .",
    "firstly , for each configuration we keep track of the current minimum number of steps @xmath69 already inserted to the left of the boundary line in order to build up that particular configuration .",
    "secondly , we calculate the minimum number of additional steps @xmath70 required to produce a valid sap or saw .",
    "there are three contributions , namely the number of steps required to connect the loops and free ends , the number of steps needed ( if any ) to ensure that the saw touches both the lower and upper border , and finally the number of steps needed ( if any ) to extend at least @xmath67 edges in the length - wise direction ( remember we only need rectangles with @xmath50 ) . if the sum @xmath71 we can discard the partial generating function for that configuration , and of course the configuration itself , because it wo nt make a contribution to the count up to the lengths we are trying to obtain .",
    "there are no principal differences between pruning saws and saps though the detailed implementation is more complicated for the saw case .",
    "we found it necessary to explicitly write subroutines to handle the three distinct cases where the tm configuration contains zero , one and two free ends , respectively .",
    "but in all cases we essentially have to go through all the possible ways of completing a saw in order to find the minimum number of steps required .",
    "this is a fairly straightforward task though quite time consuming .",
    "the time @xmath72 required to obtain the number of polygons or walks of length @xmath1 grows exponentially with @xmath1 , @xmath73 . for the algorithm without pruning the complexity",
    "can be calculated exactly .",
    "time ( and memory ) requirements are basically proportional to a polynomial ( in @xmath1 ) times the maximal number of configurations , @xmath74 , generated during a calculation .",
    "when the boundary line is straight we can find the exact number of configurations .",
    "first look at the situation for saps when there are no free ends .",
    "the configurations correspond to 2-coloured motzkin paths @xcite , since we can map empty and touched vertices to the two colours of horizontal steps , vertices in the lower state to a north - east step , and vertices in the upper state to a south - east step .",
    "the number of such paths @xmath75 with @xmath1 steps is easily derived from the generating function @xcite @xmath76/2x^2,\\ ] ] which means that @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "note that @xmath75 slightly over counts @xmath74 since configurations without a loop are nt permitted , but since there are only @xmath79 of these there is no change in the asymptotic growth .",
    "when the boundary line has a kink ( such as in figure  [ fig : transfer ] ) @xmath74 is no longer given exactly by @xmath80 .",
    "however , it is obvious that @xmath81 so we see that asymptotically @xmath74 grows like @xmath82 . since a calculation using rectangles of widths @xmath83 yields the number of saps up to @xmath84 it follows that the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath73 with @xmath85 .",
    "the number of transfer matrix configurations in the unpruned saw algorithm is simply obtained by inserting 0 , 1 or 2 free ends into a 2-coloured motzkin path and eliminating the paths corresponding to a configurations with only empty or touched vertices . in this case a calculation using rectangles of widths @xmath83 yields the number of saws up to @xmath86 it follows that the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath73 with @xmath87 .",
    "the pruned algorithm is much too difficult to analyse exactly .",
    "so all we can give is a numerical estimate of the growth in the number of configurations with @xmath1 .",
    "that is obtained by just running the algorithm and measuring the maximal number of configurations generated for different values of @xmath1 . from the actual numbers it appears that for the sap case increasing @xmath1 by 2 increases the number of configurations by slightly less than a factor of 2 .",
    "this would mean that for the pruned sap algorithm @xmath88 .",
    "in the saw case it appears that increasing @xmath1 by 4 increases the number of configuration by a factor close to 5 .",
    "so for the pruned saw algorithm @xmath89{5}=1.495\\ldots$ ] .",
    "so once again pruning results in much more efficient algorithms .",
    "the transfer - matrix algorithms used in the calculations of the finite lattice contributions are eminently suited for parallel computation .",
    "the bulk of the calculations for this paper were performed on the facilities of the australian partnership for advanced computing ( apac ) .",
    "the apac facility is an hp alpha server cluster with 125 es45 s each with four 1 ghz chips for a total of 500 processors in the compute partition .",
    "each server node has at least 4 gb of memory .",
    "nodes are interconnected by a low latency high bandwidth quadrics network .",
    "the most basic concern in any efficient parallel algorithm is to minimise the communication between processors and ensure that each processor does the same amount of work and uses the same amount of memory . in practice one",
    "naturally has to strike some compromise and accept a certain degree of variation across the processors .",
    "one of the main ways of achieving a good parallel algorithm using data decomposition is to try to find an invariant under the operation of the updating rules .",
    "that is we seek to find some property of the configurations along the boundary line which does not alter in a single iteration .",
    "the algorithm for the enumeration of saps and saws are quite complicated since not all possible configurations occur due to pruning and an update at a given set of vertices might change the state of a vertex far removed , e.g. , when two lower loop - ends are joined we have to relabel one of the associated upper loop - ends as a lower loop - end in the new configuration . however",
    ", there is still an invariant since any vertex not directly involved in the update can not change from being empty to being occupied and vice versa , likewise a touched vertex will remain unchanged . that is only the kink vertices can change their occupation or touched status .",
    "this invariant allows us to parallelise the algorithm in such a way that we can do the calculation completely independently on each processor with just two redistributions of the data set each time an extra column is added to the lattice .",
    "we have already used this scheme for saps @xcite and lattice animals @xcite and refer the interested reader to these publications for further detail .",
    "our parallelisation scheme is also very similar to that used by conway and guttmann @xcite .",
    "the generalisation of the algorithm required to calculate metric properties and area - weighted moments has been described in detail in @xcite in the square lattice case .",
    "only some minor adjustments are needed in order to apply these ideas to metric properties on the triangular lattice ( no changes are needed for the area - weighted moments ) .",
    "we have represented the triangular lattice as a square lattice with extra edges along one of the main diagonals in a unit cell .",
