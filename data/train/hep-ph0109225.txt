    "in the astrophysical literature @xcite one can find a number of phenomena which can be regarded as a possible manifestation of the existence of the so called strange quark matter ( sqm ) @xcite ( existing in the form of lumps called strangelets ) .",
    "this is extremely interesting possibility of apparently new stable form of matter ( it can decay only via weak interactions , which for a bulk of matter consisting strangelet are very inefficient in reduction its size ) . in particular one",
    "observes ( cf .",
    "@xcite for relevant references ) :    * anomalous cosmic ray bursts from _",
    "cygnus x-3 _ , * extraordinary high luminosity gamma ray burst from the _ supernova remnant n49 _ in the large magellanic cloud , * or the so called _ centauro _ events , which are characterized by anomalous composition of secondary particles with almost no neutral pions present .",
    "there were also attempts to find lumps of sqm , called _ strangelets , _ in terrestrial experiments devoted to search for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) state of matter but so far without apparent success ( cf .",
    "@xcite and last section below ) .",
    "this fact , however , does not preclude sensibility of searching for strangelets in cosmic ray experiments , which deal with strangelets formed in completely different astrophysical mechanisms @xcite , besides one witnesses their production proceeding in collisions of the original cr flux with atmospheric nuclei @xcite",
    ". however , any sqm produced at very early stage of the history of the universe would have evaporated long time ago due to the action of weak interactions @xcite . on the other hand sqm",
    "is probably continuously produced in neutron stars with a super - dense quark surface and in quark stars with a thin nucleon envelope @xcite .",
    "collisions of such objects could therefore produce small lumps of sqm , strangelets with @xmath0 , permeating the galaxy and possibly reaching also earth , i.e. , _ a priori _ being detectable here . in this presentation",
    "we demonstrate how strangelets ( not much different in size from the similar lumps of normal nuclear matter ) can still penetrate deeply in the atmosphere .",
    "we estimate the initial flux of strangelets entering the atmosphere , and finally we point out the possibility that extreme energy cosmic rays are the results of the decay of unstable primordial objects which can possibly be identified with strangelets .",
    "we shall list also the presently running and planned experiments looking for sqm being produced already at accelerators and summarize results obtained so far .",
    "typical sqm consists of roughly equal number of up _ ( u ) , _ down _ ( d ) _ and strange _ ( s ) _",
    "quarks , and it has been found to be the true ground state of qcd @xcite , i.e. , it is absolutely stable at high mass numbers @xmath1 and , because the energy per baryon in sqm could be smaller than that in ordinary nuclear matter , it would be more stable than the most tightly bound @xmath2 nucleus .",
    "the measure of stability of strangelets is provided by the so called separation energy @xmath3 , i.e. , energy which is required to remove a single baryon from a strangelet .",
    "there exists some critical size given by a critical value of @xmath4 ( vary from @xmath5 to @xmath6 depending on the various choices of parameters @xcite ) such that for @xmath7 strangelets are absolutely stable against neutron emission @xcite . below this limit strangelets",
    "decays rapidly by evaporating neutrons .",
    "+ the small value of the charge to mass ratio , @xmath8 , expected in the case of strangelets @xcite , provide us with main criterion for their discrimination among other debris when searching cosmic rays for such nuclearities .",
    "+ as we have demostrated in @xcite the rescaled radius @xmath9 of strangelets ( which follow @xmath1-dependence typical for nuclei , i.e. , @xmath10 ) is comparable to this of ordinary nuclei . considering a lump of sqm visualized after @xcite as fermi gas of _ u , d _ and _ s _ quarks , with total mass number @xmath1 which is confined in a spherical volume @xmath11 , the rescaled radius @xmath12 is determined by the number density of strange matter @xcite . for the values",
    "commonly accepted for sqm ( like the mass of the strange quark @xmath13 @xmath14 and the chemical potential @xmath15 @xmath14 ) , the values of @xmath12 of the strangelets are comparable with that for the ordinary nuclear matter @xcite ( being only a bit smaller , with differences not exceeding 10% - 20% ) . however , because the mass number @xmath1 of strangelets is much larger than the mass number of ordinary nuclei , their expected geometrical cross sections are also much larger than those for normal nuclei .",
    "it does not mean , however , that some form of sqm does not penetrate deep in the atmosphere to be finally registered . the apparent contradiction between its",
    "`` normal '' size and strong penetrability can be resolved in very simple manner .",
    "strangelets reaching so deeply into atmosphere are formed in many successive interactions with air nuclei following one of the proposed possible scenarios :    * either an initially small strangelet picks up mass from the collisions with air atoms which during its passage through earth atmosphere @xcite , * or an initially very heavy lump of sqm entering our atmosphere ( with @xmath1 of the order of @xmath16 ) decreases due to subsequent collisions with air nuclei , until its mass reaches a critical value @xmath17 at which point it disintegrates @xcite .    in what follows we",
    "explore the second scenario developed by us recently . in this way one can accomodate both the most probably `` normal '' mean free paths for successive interactions and final large penetrating depth .",
    "such scenario is fully consistent with all present experiments @xcite .",
    "the scenario proposed and tested in @xcite was that in the interaction of strangelet with target nucleus all quarks of the target ( which are located in the geometrical intersection of the two colliding nuclei ) are involved .",
    "it is assumed that each quark from the target interacts with only one quark from the strangelet ; i.e. , during interaction the mass number of strangelet is diminished to the value equal to @xmath18 at most .",
    "this procedure continuous unless either strangelet reaches earth or ( most probably ) disintegrates at some depth @xmath19 of the atmosphere reaching @xmath20 .",
    "this result , in a first approximation ( in which @xmath21 ) , in the total penetration depth of order of @xmath22 .",
    "1 shows at what depth strangelets start to become critical whereas fig .",
    "2 exposes the expected number of nucleons released from strangelet at depth @xmath19 of the atmosphere .     at depth @xmath19 of the atmosphere from the strangelet with mass number ratios",

    "however , this variant , which leads to the maximal possible destruction of quarks in strangelets , i.e. , to their maximal decreasing , can not describe adequately experimental data ( cf .",
    "there are several reports suggesting direct candidates for sqm . in particular , the following anomalous massive particles , which can be interpreted as strangelets , have been apparently observed in cosmic ray ( cr ) experiments :     and @xmath1 for sqm ( solid line ) in comparison with the same for normal nuclei ( dashed line ) .",

    "the name comes from the fact that the projectile causing that event has apparently traversed @xmath34 g/@xmath35 of atmosphere .",
    "it is remarkable that all possible candidates for sqm have mass numbers near or slightly exceeding @xmath17 ( it is also argued that _ centauro _",
    "@xcite event , regarded to be possible candidate for strangelet , contains probably @xmath34 baryons @xcite ) .",
    "also the values of @xmath36 and @xmath1 mentioned above are fully consistent with the existing theoretical estimations for @xmath37 ratio , which is characteristic for the sqm @xcite , cf .",

    "notice , that price s data favor standard model . in terms of fits ( for 3 points : _ saito ,",
    "et , centauro _ ) one gets : @xmath38 for sm and @xmath39 for tm ( dashed line ) .",
    "the choice of the power - like form of standard model was dictated by the analogy to nuclear fragmentation and the expectation that decay ( fragmentation ) of a strange star after its collision will result in the production of strangelets with similar distribution of mass .",
    "the analysis @xcite of the above listed candidates for sqm indicate that the abundance of strangelets in primary cosmic ray flux is roughly @xmath40 at the same energy per particle .",
    "we would like to discuss now shortly a number of existing experimental results obtained by emulsion chamber experiments , which can be regarded as exotic ( i.e. , not encountered so far in accelerator experiments and therefore still waiting for its proper understanding ) @xcite .",
    "those are , for example , centauro species , superfamilies with `` halo '' , the strongly penetrating component , etc .. as already mentioned , they can hardly be explained in terms of standard ideas about hadronic interactions , which we have learned so far from accelerator experiments .",
    "our monte carlo simulations show , however , that these phenomena could not originate from any kind of statistical fluctuations of `` normal '' hadronic interactions , indicating therefore that either some new mechanism of interaction or new primaries might appear in the high energy interactions .",
    "our attitude is to attribute all those effects to action of strangelets .",
    "the transition curves of anomalous cascades exhibit surprising features : a strong penetrating nature associated with very slow attenuation and appearance of many maxima with small distances between them ( about 2 - 3 times smaller than the calculated distances for the `` normal '' hadron cascades ) .",
    "we investigate @xcite the possible connection between this extremely penetrating component , frequently accompanying the cosmic ray exotic phenomena , and the hypothesis of the formation of strangelets taking place in the process of strangeness distillation , being the last stage of the evolution of the quark matter droplet .",
    "we find that many - maxima long - range cascades observed in the homogeneous lead emulsion chamber experiments can be produced in the process of strangelet penetration through the apparatus .",
    "the bundle of hadrons provides the possible explanation for the anomalous ( strongly penetrating ) showers . in order to explain the mutual distance distribution of the sub - showers maxima positions , we need only a few @xmath41 hadrons concentrated in the very forward region .",
    "the assumption of strangelet with @xmath42 penetrating through the chamber and evaporate neutrons leads to the formation of the long - range many - maxima cascades similar to those observed in the experiment .",
    "the existing experimental data , however , are not sufficient to decide if they are produced by ( stable or unstable ) strangelets .",
    "the castor detecting system , proposed as a subsystem of the alice experiment at lhc could help in solving the existing uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the centauro and mini - centauro events , characterized by the extreme imbalance between hadronic and gamma - ray components among the produced secondaries , are the best known examples of numerous unusual events reported in cosmic - ray experiments .",
    "there are many attempts to explain them ( different types of isospin fluctuations or formation of disoriented chiral condensate , multiparticle bose - einstein correlations , strange quark matter formation or interaction ) .",
    "it was shown that families recorded at mountain altitudes are insensitive to any isospin fluctuations .",
    "centauro - like phenomena require deeply penetrating component in cosmic rays .",
    "we claim that they can be products of strangelets penetrating deeply into atmosphere and evaporating neutrons @xcite .",
    "both the flux ratio of centauros registered at different depths and the energy distribution within them can be successfully described by such concept .",
    "phenomenon of alignment of structural objects of gamma - hadron families near a stright line in the plane at the target diagram was first observed during examination of multicore halos and , later , when observing distinguished energetic cores ( i.e. , halos , energetic hadrons , high energy gamma quanta or narrow particle groups ) @xcite .",
    "the excess of aligned families found in these cases exceeds any known conventional concept of interaction .",
    "many attempts to interpret this phenomenon of coplanar emission were undertaken .",
    "however , up to now no satisfactory explanation exists .",
    "the trouble is that this alignment occurs in spite of the fact that there is always substantial number of interactions contributing to family formation .",
    "the long - flying component with mean free path of the few hundreds of @xmath43 is required . as a tentative explanation",
    "the arrival of strangelets with high spin @xmath44 and gradual dispersion of mass @xmath45 along their way through the atmosphere can be given .",
