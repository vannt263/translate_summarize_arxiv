    "the nature of the initial singularity of our universe is an important but unsolved problem in modern cosmology .",
    "the traditional approach to this problem is to canonically quantize the universe and study the wave function , by solving the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "there is no general consensus on the boundary condition of the wave function for our universe .",
    "however , perhaps one natural way to address this problem is to consider that our universe is in the ground state .",
    "hartle and hawking @xcite observed that the ground state can be written in terms of the euclidean path integral .",
    "thus they suggested an analogous extension to cosmology including gravitation , so - called the no - boundary wave function .    the no - boundary wave function can be interpreted as a superposition of space - time histories .",
    "it can be approximated by sum - over on - shell solutions , so - called instantons . traditionally , there are two approaches to calculate the instantons .",
    "one way is following the technique of @xcite : by assuming the scalar field to be approximately constant , integrate the euclidean action over a part of the four - sphere metric @xcite .",
    "this result exponentially prefers small vacuum energy , and hence some people believed that our universe probably has zero vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "the other way is to obtain the wave function by solving the wheeler - dewitt equation directly @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "again , we have to assume the slow - rolling limit ; hence , we can reduce the equation as an ordinary differential equation .",
    "one strong point of this approach is that this approach allows some alternative boundary conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "again , the hartle - hawking wave function exponentially prefers small @xmath2-foldings .",
    "all these approaches rely on analytic techniques and had to assume the slow - roll limit",
    ". however , in general situations , we have to consider dynamical instantons .",
    "note that the sum - over instantons can have problems of divergence @xcite , which may be alleviated by considering complex valued instantons @xcite , so - called _ fuzzy instantons _",
    "if we use fuzzy instantons , by using numerical techniques , we can deal with the dynamical  even fast - rolling  situations .",
    "although the instantons should be complexified , we see a real valued world ; in other words , we see a classical universe .",
    "this means that not all the complex - valued instantons are allowed , but only certain special instantons that approach to real valued functions are indeed allowed . for this preferred subset of histories ,",
    "the no - boundary wave function assigns a _ semi - classical _ probability distribution , so - called the no - boundary measure .",
    "technically , to find classicalized histories , we need a searching process . this was studied analytically and approximately by lyons @xcite and numerically and more precisely by hartle , hawking and hertog @xcite . in @xcite , they calculated for a quadratic potential that has only one local minimum in einstein gravity ; the present authors studied the no - boundary measure for more general examples : scalar - tensor gravity @xcite and fast - rolling fields around the hill - top @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use the same numerical algorithm that was developed by the present authors .    due to previous studies",
    ", it was known that the no - boundary measure disfavors the histories which have a large number of @xmath2-foldings .",
    "if we believe that the early universe had experienced more than @xmath3 @xmath2-foldings from primordial inflation , the no - boundary measure is not compatible with this expectation .    on these grounds",
    ", one may reject the no - boundary wave function in favor of other prescriptions , for example vilenkin s tunneling proposal @xcite , which may however be regarded as less natural on theoretical grounds .",
    "perhaps , it can be better to obtain large @xmath2-foldings , but the out - going mode on the superspace needs further explanations ; moreover , if the potential is sufficiently steep and hence the field becomes dynamic , then it is not clear how to calculate the wave function precisely . on the other hand , by accepting the fact that the no - boundary wave function disfavor large @xmath2-foldings , but    * try to avoid the need for a long period of inflation such as ekpyrotic universe @xcite , string gas cosmology @xcite , the big bounce model @xcite , or the pre - big - bang model @xcite , * justify inflation on anthropic grounds , for example in the context of the multiverse @xcite , * lift up the inflationary probabilities by considering the volume weighting @xcite .",
    "these proposals each come with their own questions and difficulties attached . therefore in this article",
    "we explore another mechanism to lift up the probability for the larger @xmath2-foldings in the context of the no - boundary measure .",
    "we study the no - boundary measure of _ multiple fields _ and argue that _ the degeneracy of the large number of fields can lift up the probability of inflationary histories _ without considering any additional factors .",
    "although the euclidean action does not prefer inflationary histories , there exist many numbers of histories which produce larger @xmath2-foldings , if we have approximately @xmath4 number of fields , where @xmath5 is the mass of each field .",
    "in section  [ nb_proposal ] , we briefly review the no - boundary wave function and explain the reason why it does not prefer inflationary histories . in section  [ sec_nb_nflation ] , the no - boundary measure is extended to the multi - field case and @xmath6-flation models , and it is demonstrated that the degeneracy can lift up the probability of larger @xmath2-foldings .",
    "we also relate the model with the observations .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and discuss possible extensions in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the ground state of the universe , or the no - boundary condition of the wave function of the universe , can be described by the euclidean path integral @xcite : @xmath7 = \\sum_\\mathcal{t } \\int \\mathcal{d}g_{\\mu\\nu } \\mathcal{d } \\phi \\ ; e^{-s_{\\text{e}}[g_{\\mu\\nu } , \\phi ] } , \\label{nb_single_waveftn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denote compact manifold topologies with a single spherical boundary , and the metric @xmath9 and the matter field @xmath10 take the value @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the boundary . here , @xmath13 is the euclidean action : we assume einstein gravity and a minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath14 in the units @xmath15 . in this paper , for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our interests to a minisuperspace ; for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , the metric becomes @xmath16 in this context , it is convenient to view the time integral in the action as a contour integral in the complex time plane ( for details see for example @xcite ) and shift the contour in suitable ways .",
    "thus , @xmath17 ( which we take to be in @xmath18 $ ] ) is a parametrization of the chosen contour .",
    "the no - boundary wave function takes the form @xmath19 = \\int \\mathcal{d}n \\mathcal{d}a \\mathcal{d}\\phi \\ ; e^{-s_{\\text{e}}[a,\\phi]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the boundary values at the only boundary of space - time , and at @xmath22 one imposes conditions suitable for a regular metric (  no - boundary conditions \" ) .",
    "the path integral can be approximated by the method of steepest descent .",

    "the on - shell action can be simplified to @xmath31    we are especially interested in regions in which the wave function behaves almost classically . in the saddle point approximation ,",
    "equation  , this requires the condition so - called the classicality , @xmath32| \\ll |\\nabla s_{\\text{e}}^{\\text{im}}[b,\\chi]| , \\label{eqn : classicality}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the real and imaginary parts of the euclidean action and @xmath35 is a derivation that is defined on the superspace . in other words , among various complex valued on - shell histories , we should select some of them that satisfy this condition . to select such histories , in @xcite , we discussed the details of the numerical searching algorithm ; the same algorithm is adopted in this paper .",
    "we call them",
    "_ classicalized histories_.",
    "the probability for classicalized histories becomes @xmath36 \\varpropto |\\psi[b,\\chi]|^{2}\\ , db\\,d\\chi \\simeq e^{-2 s_{\\text{e}}^{\\text{re}}[b,\\chi]}\\ , db\\,d\\chi .",
    "\\label{classicality}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the no - boundary measure is defined on the boundary of the histories , @xmath37 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is convenient to label a history not by the boundary values , but by the initial conditions , for slow - roll cases .",
    "moreover , if the field slowly moves , then the euclidean action is well approximated by the potential energy at the turning point from the euclidean time to the lorentzian time @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in these cases ,",
    "one thus has @xmath40 \\varpropto \\exp \\left(\\frac{3}{8 } \\frac{1}{v(\\varphi)}\\right)\\ , d\\varphi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as an approximation of the probability to observe a history starting from @xmath41 in the euclidean regime .",
    "we take the simplest inflation model for single field as one having a quadratic potential @xcite @xmath42 in @xcite , hartle , hawking and hertog could show by numerically and analytically such that , except for @xmath43 , only @xmath41 larger than a critical value has the solution space satisfying the classicality : equation  .",
    "that is , the classicalized history exists only for @xmath44 one may worry about the point @xmath43 since the action as well as the no - boundary measure could diverge there .",
    "however , due to the divergence it is impossible to evaluate the derivatives in the classicality condition , equation  .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 is surrounded by non - classical points in field space , and it is hard to see how the action would even be defined as a differentiable function .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to regard @xmath43 as a non - classical point and it is not considered in the followings .    in the slow - roll approximation",
    "@xcite , the total @xmath2-folding number obtained from @xmath41 is approximated by @xmath45 of course , when the scalar field rolls around the local minimum after the inflation , few @xmath2-foldings can be added , but we can ignore them . the previous formula can be further reduced for the quadratic potential equation  : @xmath46 then , the no - boundary measure , equation  , can be expressed as a function of @xmath2-folding number @xmath47 \\varpropto \\exp \\left(\\frac{3 \\pi}{2 } \\frac{1}{m^{2 } \\mathcal{n}_{e}}\\right)\\ , d\\mathcal{n}_e . \\label{nb_single_ne}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the jacobian of the change of variables is ignored because the exponential part is dominant .",

    "there are several possible interpretations of this disagreement between the prediction of the no - boundary measure and the inflationary universe .",
    "one of the ideas is the volume weighting .",
    "it enhances the likelihood of larger @xmath2-foldings by multiplying the volume ( @xmath50 ) for each history @xcite , @xmath47 \\varpropto \\exp \\left(\\frac{3 \\pi}{2 } \\frac{1}{m^{2 } \\mathcal{n}_{e } } + 3 \\mathcal{n}_{e}\\right)\\ , d\\mathcal{n}_e.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this volume weighting sufficiently lifts up the probability of larger @xmath2-foldings , if @xmath51 in the following , we will study under which conditions the addition of further fields may have a similar effect .",
    "in this section , we study the no - boundary measure with multiple fields . as simple toy model , we take all fields , having same quadratic potential type for simplicity as in the earlier works on @xmath6-flation models  @xcite - flation paradigm  @xcite have worked under the assumption that all relevant fields are close to their minima and can be described by quadratic potentials . for axions",
    "the full potential is trigonometric and recently refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the quadratic approximation is unreliable .",
    "the reason we follow the earlier works rather than the more recent ones is mainly for simplicity . we intend to do further work on for the case of more complicated potentials . ] where it was shown that any of these fields does not need to take on values in excess of the planck scale and a large number of fields , predicted by string vacuum solutions , is needed to get sufficient @xmath2-foldings .",
    "we take @xmath6-flation models as a possible candidate of the multi - field inflation models throughout this paper .",
    "the basic effect that we will be investigating is that , although large amounts of inflation are still suppressed in terms of the action , there are now many histories that contribute to a given amount of inflation .",

    ", we assumed a _",

    "2 .   the mass can be different for different fields , e.g. , refs .",
    "if the euclidean dynamics highly depends on the larger mass , then the required number of fields to lift up the larger @xmath2-foldings can be reduced .",

    "if the fields couple in complicated ways , then again , the euclidean cutoff structures can be changed .",
    "therefore , from the similar arguments , one may reduce the number of fields to a reasonable amount .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that considering the no - boundary wave function for many fields can solve the traditional problem of low probabilities for sufficient inflation .",
