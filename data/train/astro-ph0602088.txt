    "the galaxy merger rate is estimated from the number density of morphologically disturbed galaxies or kinematically close pairs .",
    "accurate merger rates from kinematic pair statistics are challenging , requiring spectroscopic velocities for both companions , and are therefore observationally expensive and suffer from incompleteness .",
    "recent work has attempted to derive the close pair statistics from the two - point correlation function of large numbers of galaxies ( masjedi et al .",

    "morphology studies , especially with deep and high resolution hubble space telescope ( @xmath19 ) images , do not suffer from the same incompleteness problems , yet the morphological merger fraction is also elusive .",
    "morphological disturbances which are the result of recent or on - going mergers can be determined via visual classifications or by identifying outliers in quantitative morphology distributions .",
    "the visual classification of galaxy morphology is time - consuming and subjective .",
    "also , not all visually ` peculiar ' galaxies are necessarily major mergers ( e.g. some are irregulars ) and high - redshift disks are more likely to be mis - classified as peculiars due to surface - brightness effects and wavelength - dependent morphologies ( brinchmann et al . 1998 ; marcum et al . 2001 ; windhorst et al .",

    "most previous quantitative morphology studies aimed at finding merger candidates have used concentration and asymmetry measurements ( e.g. abraham et al . 1996 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; cassata et al . 2005 ; menanteau et al .",
    "however , asymmetry measures are less sensitive to merger remnants in late stages , and require high signal - to - noise images to overcome noisy background residuals . in this paper , we use the gini coefficient ( @xmath20 ) and the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of a galaxy s pixels ( @xmath2 ) which has been shown to be more effective than concentration and asymmetry at identifying late - stage mergers and classifying galaxies ( lotz , primack , & madau 2004 , hereafter lpm04 ) .",
    "the gini coefficient and @xmath2 are also more robust at low signal - to - noise ratios ( lpm04 ; lotz et al .",
    "recent attempts to combine @xmath20 , @xmath2 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 using a principal component analysis also have yielded promising results ( scarlata et al .",

    "galaxies in our final morphological sample must have ( 1 ) reliable rest - frame optical morphological measurements , i.e. @xmath61 per pixel @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and contiguous segmentation maps and ( 2 ) a reliable spectroscopic or photometric redshift , i.e. quality @xmath70 for deep2 @xmath90 or 3 or more bands used for cfhtls @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the completeness of our matched morphology - redshift catalog depends on the detection limits in the acs images , the surface - brightness and size limits of our morphological measurements , and the completeness of the deep2 and cfhtls redshift catalogs which may be a function of observed color as well as magnitude .",
