    "recent results from fermilab  @xcite indicate that the top quark is rather heavy ( @xmath9 gev ) , while recent results from lep  @xcite indicate that @xmath10 might be inconsistent ( up to @xmath11 ) with such a heavy top . in this letter",
    "we assume that both measurements are correct , and point out the rather powerful implications this has if nature is supersymmetric .",
    "first , we give a brief discussion of the standard model ( sm ) prediction for @xmath12 which is approximately @xmath13 to @xmath11 away from the latest experimental measurement .",
    "we then consider the effect of supersymmetry ( susy ) on this process .",
    "in particular , we consider both the mssm and the popular `` super - unified '' approach to supersymmetric model building .",
    "we demonstrate a no - lose theorem for discovery of superpartners at coming collider upgrades given @xmath3 experimental bounds on @xmath12 and @xmath0 , and a very minimal set of theoretical assumptions .    in considering the question of the @xmath12 discrepancy",
    ", one can take either of two attitudes .",
    "perhaps the @xmath12 measurement is finally the one which directly demonstrates the existence of physics beyond the standard model ; if so , its implications for the discovery of supersymmetry are dramatic ( assuming susy is the origin of the deviation ) . yet , as we will discuss in this paper , the `` super - unified '' susy models produce values for @xmath12 near those of the sm , not large enough to explain the @xmath12 discrepancy .",
    "thus even if susy is the correct theory , it is not unlikely that the measurements of @xmath12 will approach the sm expectation as systematic effects are more fully understood .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 is very sensitive to vertex corrections involving a heavy top quark . within the standard model these corrections are negative and grow like @xmath15 .",
    "( this can be seen best in the t  hooft - feynman gauge where the @xmath16 coupling is proportional to @xmath17 . ) on the other hand , the @xmath17-dependent oblique corrections are to a good approximation universal and therefore largely cancel out in the @xmath14 ratio .",
    "this effectively isolates the vertex corrections , thereby providing both an excellent test of the sm s self - consistency and a place to search for new physics beyond the reach of current experiments .    using the program zpole  @xcite we have calculated @xmath14 in the on - shell scheme for @xmath18 as a function of the top quark pole mass , @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ rbos ] we have plotted the experimental values ( and their @xmath3 ranges ) for @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also show the zpole calculation of the sm prediction as the shaded region in the figure .",
    "the sm prediction as quoted by lep  @xcite , which is calculated by zfitter in the on - shell scheme , falls on the right edge of the shaded region . to be conservative",
    "we utilize the rightmost edge of the sm prediction for @xmath14 in all our calculations and comparisons since it lies closest to the the experimental measurement .    with an sm prediction in hand",
    "we now can compare with lep s measurement of @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty includes the quoted statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "one sees from fig .",
    "[ rbos ] that @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "this is approximately 2@xmath22 away from the above quoted experimental measurement .",
    "disagreement of experiment and theory for other values of @xmath0 can likewise be read off from fig .",
    "[ rbos ] . since a heavy top forces @xmath14 downward",
    ", a rather large positive contribution to @xmath14 from new physics clearly is required to lift @xmath14 to the reported central value , given cdf s measurement of a heavy top quark mass .",
    "we understand of course that the measured @xmath12 may decrease as systematic effects are better understood . however , if @xmath12 is the long - awaited deviation from the sm that heralds the onset of new physics , its implications for susy are dramatic .",
    "more precisely , the question we consider here is the following : what implications are there for supersymmetry if the true value of @xmath14 _ is _ within one standard deviation of the current measurement at lep and the true value of @xmath0 _ is _ within one standard deviation of the current measurement at fnal ?",
    "henceforth we premise the true value of @xmath14 and @xmath0 to be within @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , and investigate the consequences of this statement .",
    "we find several surprising results .",
    "in a supersymmetric theory there are additional corrections to the @xmath25 vertex which scale like @xmath15 from the charged higgs  top quark loops and the chargino  top squark loops .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath26 is very large then , for example , the pseudoscalar higgs ( @xmath27 ) coupling to @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath29 and the bottom squark@xmath30neutralino ( @xmath31 ) coupling similarly is proportional to @xmath32 . for @xmath33 these contributions from `` neutral exchanges ''",
    "can be sizable .",
    "the supersymmetric electroweak vertex corrections to the @xmath25 vertex at the @xmath34 pole have been analyzed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "we primarily draw from the formulas of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see appendix ) in order to calculate the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath14 .",
    "we will now investigate the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which we define as the minimal ( but most general ) @xmath35 gauge invariant lagrangian containing the particle content of the sm , but which is supersymmetric ( up to soft - breaking terms ) and @xmath36-parity conserving .    despite the large number of unknown soft - breaking parameters within the mssm",
    ", any individual process usually depends only on a small subset .",
    "thus it is with @xmath12 , where only 12 unknown parameters of the mssm enter .",
    "we will show that the experimental values for @xmath12 may be used to constrain certain of these parameters to ranges that can be easily probed in the near future . since the sm prediction for @xmath14 is below the experimental one ,",
    "the value which becomes most important to us for the present analysis is @xmath37 , the maximum value which @xmath12 can take given any set of inputs and constraints .    the independent parameters which enter the calculation of @xmath12 are @xmath6 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( from which one gets the chargino and neutralino masses and mixings ) , the physical top and bottom squark masses and their mixing angles ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) , the pseudoscalar higgs mass , and @xmath45 ( the super - ckm angle between the bottom and top squarks ) . in theory , determining @xmath37 for any given set of assumptions is very difficult , for it will be a complicated function of all the free parameters which enter the process .",
    "luckily , we can separate the dependences on many of the parameters and work with them independently . for example",
    ", @xmath46 is always maximal when @xmath47 , regardless of the values of the other parameters .",
    "some parameters are _ almost _ separable .",
    "the top squark mixing parameter , @xmath48 , tends to maximize @xmath49 for values which are small and negative .",
    "yet the choice @xmath50 always produces a near - maximal @xmath12 , up to corrections of order @xmath51 , far too small for us to worry about here .",
    "having now chosen @xmath50 one then finds that @xmath52 decouples and its mass is no longer one of the parameters on which @xmath12 depends for low to intermediate @xmath6 .",
    "also in this region of @xmath6 , the bottom squark ",
    "neutralino contributions decouple completely , leaving @xmath12 independent of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath38 .",
    "finally , @xmath12 is most strongly dependent on the masses of the light chargino(s ) , light top squark(s ) , and for large @xmath6 , neutral higgs bosons .",
    "lighter top squarks simply give larger contributions to @xmath12 .",
    "the chargino contributions are much more complicated since they induce a local maximum of @xmath12 right at @xmath53 where @xmath12 can be very large .",
    "unfortunately , current bounds on the chargino mass fall right at @xmath54 ; were these mass bounds a few gev higher , much stricter bounds , for example on @xmath55 and @xmath6 , could be determined .",
    "this will be demonstrated explicitly later . finally , the dependence on @xmath56 changes sign as @xmath6 increases , weakly favoring large @xmath56 ( actually , large @xmath57 ) for small to moderate @xmath6 , but strongly favoring small @xmath56 for large @xmath6 .",
    "one has in total twelve parameters , though only seven of them are relevant at low to intermediate values of @xmath6 ; with any fewer we lose complete generality .",
    "one may summarize the nature of our no - lose theorem thusly : susy is a decoupling theory .",
    "that is , if susy is to make measurable contributions to the radiative corrections of sm processes , the mass scale of the susy partners must be near to the scale of the sm physics being studied . only for masses of spartners",
    "near to the current experimental limits can one expect to notice their effects through loops in sm diagrams .",
    "as these masses increase , the sm prediction for any given quantity is again realized .",
    "thus , if we are to explain the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values for @xmath12 using susy , the susy mass scale can not be large .",
    "that said , it remains to be seen what kind of numerical bounds can be placed on the masses of the sparticles entering into the susy contributions to @xmath12 .",
    "the final result of such an analysis yields this : _ if the discrepancy in @xmath12 is to be explained by the mssm , then direct observation of superpartners at lep  ii or an upgraded tevatron will occur .",
    "_ strict bounds may be placed on chargino and top squark masses if susy is to explain the value for @xmath12 : @xmath58 and @xmath55 or @xmath59 .",
    "stronger bounds can also be found .",
    "for example , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 . under additional constraints , bounds exist also on @xmath56 , @xmath62 , and @xmath6 .",
    "this theorem holds under the following set of assumptions which we will examine below : _",
    "( i ) _ the true value for @xmath12 is within @xmath3 of quoted lep measurements , _ ( ii ) _ the true value for @xmath0 is within @xmath3 of quoted cdf measurements , _ ( iii ) _ contributions from the mssm are responsible for the difference between the actual and theoretical sm values , _ ( iv ) _",
    "the yukawa couplings of the mssm remain perturbative up to scales @xmath4 ( a so - called perturbatively valid theory ) , and _",
    "( v ) _ various experimental lower bounds on sparticle masses from direct searches .",
    "let us examine these conditions .",
    "the very first condition is also the one least trusted by us .",
    "current lep bounds on @xmath12 are @xmath13 to @xmath11 from theoretical expectations ; however , if the lep measurement of @xmath12 migrates over time to the sm value , our theorem will of course cease to be meaningful .",
    "the second condition is important mostly for the @xmath3 lower bound on @xmath0 . in the sm as @xmath0 decreases , the prediction for @xmath12 increases such that the discrepancy between experiment and theory lessens .",
    "also , when coupled with the requirement of perturbative validity ( condition _ ( iv ) _ above ) , the lower bound on @xmath0 places a lower bound on @xmath6 .",
    "this lower bound on @xmath6 is necessary for the existence of upper mass bounds ( see below ) .",
    "the third condition listed above is self - explanatory .",
    "the fourth condition of perturbative validity is necessary in order to place upper and lower bounds on @xmath6 .",
    "the requirement that the top , bottom , and tau yukawa couplings remain perturbative up to a scale @xmath4 places limits on @xmath6 of > 60 where typically @xmath63 .",
    "these limits are necessary in order to gain mass bounds on the chargino and top squark .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ alltanb ] , where the maximum value for @xmath12 is plotted against @xmath6 for two choices of @xmath64 . clearly as @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", @xmath12 can become large even for heavy charginos and top squarks .",
    "= 3.25 in    the fifth and final `` condition '' is the set of experimental lower bounds that we apply to the masses of the mssm .",
    "we take @xmath67 and the rather conservative @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "we take lower bounds on the pseudoscalar mass from the non - observation of @xmath69 ( low @xmath6 ) and @xmath70 ( high @xmath6 ) at lep , with @xmath27 then decaying into @xmath71 .",
    "these bounds are @xmath6-dependent . for @xmath72",
    "< , @xmath73  @xcite ; for @xmath74 , @xmath75  @xcite .    in the following sections we demonstrate how the bounds on chargino and top squarks are determined through the set of five conditions above .",
    "one should note that the bounds given above can be easily tightened .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 is found to be larger than its @xmath3 lower bound then our bounds will become stronger . for @xmath76 , the separate upper bounds on @xmath64 and @xmath55 decrease to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with a corresponding decrease in the minimum of the two .",
    "bounds on @xmath6 will also exist if values of @xmath64 near to @xmath79 are ruled out experimentally , as shown by fig .",
    "[ alltanb ] ; there the lower line represents @xmath37 for @xmath80 , in which case we see that the entire region of @xmath81 is ruled out by the @xmath3 @xmath12 bounds .",
    "consider first the case of low @xmath6 ( , @xmath83 ) .",
    "here one finds that @xmath12 increases monotonically as @xmath6 decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ alltanb ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath84 is found at the boundary where @xmath85 . for intermediate @xmath6 ( , @xmath86 ) ,",
    "@xmath37 increases with @xmath6 but remains below the values obtained at very small @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , one may simplify the analysis in this region by only considering the lowest possible value of @xmath6 for a given @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ ctlow ] we have plotted contours of @xmath87 ( the @xmath3 lower experimental bound ) against @xmath64 and @xmath55 , for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . recall that @xmath37 is the largest value that the theory can produce , regardless of the values of the other parameters not shown in the plot . to be conservative , we take @xmath91 , thereby allowing smaller @xmath6 ( and thus larger @xmath37 ) for a given top quark mass .",
    "we emphasize that what is shown are the maximum values of @xmath92 and @xmath64 that can give @xmath14 within @xmath3 of its reported value . in the figure ,",
    "the regions to the left and below each line are compatible with the @xmath3 bounds on @xmath12 ; the regions above and to the right are excluded .",
    "= 3.25 in    one can read the central result of the no - lose theorem from this graph : by combining the @xmath3 bounds on the top quark mass from cdf and on @xmath12 from lep , one can place upper bounds of @xmath93 on the mass of the lighter chargino and @xmath94 on the mass of the lighter top squark in the low to intermediate @xmath6 region . however , one or the other must always be lighter than about @xmath95 . for @xmath0 above @xmath96 ,",
    "these limits become stronger .",
    "these bounds are to our knowledge the strongest experimental bounds on the mssm to date .",
    "they do not depend on any scheme for soft - breaking parameters , on constraints from dark matter or proton decay , or any assumptions other than those few listed .",
    "they imply that with an upgrade in energy to @xmath97 at lep a chargino or a top squark must be found , and with an upgrade in luminosity at the tevatron both the chargino and the top squark should be found .",
    "therefore , the `` @xmath3 '' ranges of chargino and top squark masses as shown in fig .",
    "[ ctlow ] could be completely probed if @xmath98 .",
    "further , if @xmath99 and @xmath100 , then @xmath6 is restricted to be close to 1 .",
    "therefore , the mass of the lightest higgs approaches zero at tree level , most of its mass then being due to radiative corrections . since we bound the lighter top squark mass , the leading term in the corrections to the higgs mass ( which goes as @xmath101 )",
    "is determined up to the value of the heavier top squark . ignoring contributions due to top squark mixing",
    ", one finds that for @xmath102 , @xmath103 ; likewise for @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "thus in the low to intermediate @xmath6 regime , @xmath106 may also be accessible at lep or fnal .",
    "large values of @xmath12 can also be attained for high @xmath6 .",
    "once again , it is at the perturbative edge ( @xmath107 ) that we obtain the largest @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , it is also this region of very high @xmath6 that is motivated by @xmath7 yukawa unification within minimal so(10 ) models . in this region interactions proportional to @xmath108 become comparable to and possibly more significant than the @xmath17 dependent interactions . therefore , neutralino  bottom squark loops and neutral higgs ",
    "bottom quark loops must be considered .",
    "four of the independent parameters of our model which could be ignored in the low @xmath6 region , namely the bottom squark masses and mixing angle , and @xmath38 , must now be included when we maximize @xmath12 .",
    "this significantly complicates the process and the demonstration of our theorem , so we again separate those variables that can be taken independent from the others .",
    "one simplification would be to set @xmath109 , as indicated by wide classes of supergravity and superstring scenarios .",
    "we have taken this simplification as well - motivated and base most of our numerical results in the high @xmath6 limit on it ; however , we have checked that perturbing the ratio of @xmath38 to @xmath39 by an additional factor of two in either direction only changes our calculations of @xmath37 by less than @xmath110 .    the bottom squark masses and mixing provide another complication .",
    "our calculations indicate that @xmath12 is maximized when both bottom squarks are light , near to their lower bound which we take to be @xmath111 .",
    "the squarks are then nearly degenerate in mass and the mixing angle becomes arbitrary .",
    "the higgs sector behaves in the high @xmath6 limit very differently than in the opposite limit . unlike in the low @xmath6 case , a light pseudoscalar higgs yields an overall large _ positive _ contribution to @xmath12 .",
    "the contribution of the light charged higgs is still negative , but is overwhelmed by a large contribution from neutral higgs ",
    "bottom quark loops which increases with @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we must reintroduce the pseudoscalar mass as a variable when working in this region .",
    "however the experimental constraint that @xmath75 for @xmath112  @xcite leads to chargino bounds at large @xmath6 which are tighter than those at small @xmath6 .",
    "how do discovery limits compare in the high @xmath6 region ?",
    "most significantly , one finds that @xmath113 , a tighter bound than existed in the low @xmath6 limit .",
    "however , it is not solely the chargino ",
    "top squark loops that are responsible for this bound , but also the neutralino  bottom squark loops .",
    "as the chargino mass becomes larger and its contributions decouple , @xmath37 plummets towards the sm value , thereby placing a bound on @xmath64 .",
    "yet as @xmath6 increases , the neutralino contributions can be sizable , bringing @xmath12 back into agreement with experiment .",
    "thus there is really a bound on a combination of the neutralino and chargino masses .",
    "but the appearance of the same @xmath40 in both sectors means that bounds can be placed on each individually , leading to the @xmath114 for the chargino given above .",
    "the comparable neutralino bound is then approximately @xmath115 .",
    "if the @xmath3 lower bound of @xmath12 shifted to @xmath116 , then the bounds on the chargino and neutralino would relax to @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "the same interplay we found between chargino and neutralino masses is of course also found in the top and bottom squark sectors . under the assumption of nearly degenerate bottom squarks",
    ", one finds that either a bottom _ or _ a top squark must be lighter than @xmath119 ( @xmath93 ) for @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , a weaker bound than was found in the low @xmath6 limit .",
    "but unlike the case for the charginos and neutralinos , no individual bounds exist on the top and bottom squarks alone .",
    "finally , there are also the contributions due to @xmath27bottom quark loops .",
    "once again an upper bound can be placed on @xmath56 consistent with @xmath12 if @xmath122 . here",
    "we find that @xmath123 is necessary .",
    "thus , light pseudoscalars are implied by @xmath12 for high @xmath6 , once one constrains charginos to be slightly heavier than the current bound of @xmath79 .",
    "much work has been completed recently by a number of groups on the phenomenology of `` super - unified '' minimal susy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these models are constructed under the assumption of not only gauge coupling unification at some high scale , but also unification of various soft mass parameters in the mssm lagrangian ( a common gaugino and a common scalar mass ) .",
    "one then connects these high scale assumptions to low - energy phenomenology through the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) of the parameters , under the condition that electroweak symmetry - breaking occurs radiatively at scales @xmath124 .    in two previous works  @xcite , the super - unified mssm was assumed and a number of constraints stemming from direct experimental searches for susy , cleo bounds on @xmath125 , relic abundances of the lightest susy particle , etc .",
    "were assumed .",
    "what remained of the original parameter space of the super - unified models was called the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "the natural question is , then , what ranges of values for @xmath12 are predicted for solutions consistent with the cmssm ?",
    "in fact , one finds that the constraints of the cmssm force @xmath12 to lie below approximately @xmath126 , some @xmath127 below the reported @xmath12 for @xmath128 .",
    "[ rbos ] shows the cmssm s `` line of closest approach '' to the experimentally measured value of @xmath14 .",
    "this closest approach line does not enter the 1@xmath22 area , and therefore cmssm can not bring lep s measurement of @xmath14 into agreement with fnal s measurement of @xmath0 ; conversely , one could say that the cmssm predicts @xmath12 below the line given in fig .",
    "[ rbos ] .",
    "why is the cmssm incapable of producing larger values for @xmath12 ?",
    "naively , one would expect contributions from supersymmetric masses @xmath129 to have a large contribution to the @xmath130 partial width just as the @xmath131 boson itself has . as described earlier , there exist interactions of the charginos with top squarks and quarks which are large , proportional to the top yukawa coupling ( @xmath132 ) , and enhance @xmath12 .",
    "similar contributions exist at large @xmath6 for the neutral higgs bosons with bottom quarks and squarks , proportional to the @xmath6-enhanced bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "these interactions could lead to @xmath12 consistent with experiment .",
    "we now summarize the reasons that they do not .",
    "the coupling of the top quarks to charginos and top squarks , proportional to the large top yukawa coupling , is given by @xmath133 in order to maximize the impact of this coupling , we need a light top squark with a significant right - handed component and a light chargino with a significant higgsino component .",
    "these are both difficult requirements for the cmssm , and they are quite impossible to satisfy simultaneously .    within cmssm , the choice of common scalar masses means that @xmath134 is invariably smaller than @xmath135 due to the running of the rge s from the gut scale down to the weak scale . yet",
    "the resulting @xmath55 is rarely smaller than @xmath136 unless we impose large mixing between the @xmath137 and @xmath138 eigenstates .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath139 will have a significant @xmath137 component which does not couple to the charginos with @xmath132 .",
    "the lightest chargino is even more troublesome .",
    "the chargino mass matrix depends on @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath6 . with radiative breaking @xmath40 scales",
    "roughly as max@xmath140 and thus generally dominates the chargino matrix ( for a discussion , see ref .",
    "this means that the charginos with significant higgsino components are heavy , generally well above @xmath136 , and even though they couple with a factor of @xmath132 , these contributions will be kinematically suppressed .",
    "solutions with a chargino as light as @xmath79 can be obtained , but since they will be almost all @xmath141 they do not couple as @xmath132 .",
    "when we try to simultaneously satisfy the two requirements of a light @xmath142 and a light @xmath143 , we find that the cmssm is incapable of providing a solution .",
    "the two requirements actually push solutions in different , incompatible directions .",
    "large mixing in the top squark sector generally requires @xmath40 ( or @xmath144 ) to be large , while light higgsino - like charginos require @xmath40 ( thus @xmath144 also ) to be small .    in the high @xmath6 region ,",
    "the additional contributions coming from the pseudoscalar  bottom squark loops are likewise suppressed .",
    "the cmssm generally produces heavy bottom squarks and also heavy pseudoscalars , so that their contributions will be small and can not bring the cmssm into agreement with experiment .    for these reasons , and after much numerical work",
    ", we can conclude that the cmssm is incompatible ( to @xmath127 ) with the experimental measurements of @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "those who wonder how easy it is to vary susy parameters in order to fit data should note this result .",
    "clearly , the cmssm s ability to fit experiment _ for this particular observable _ is inextricably tied to the standard model s since the predictions are essentially the same .",
    "what of models which unify the gauge couplings but not the soft - breaking parameters ?",
    "one may use a `` bottom - up '' approach in building models at the gut scale , starting from the constraints of the low - energy theory . of particular interest is the case motivated by @xmath7 yukawa coupling unification in so(10 ) . here",
    "one finds that large @xmath6 is necessary , which could be consistent with @xmath12 given the increase in @xmath37 that occurs at very large @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ alltanb ] ) .",
    "however , the rge s for the soft masses can be analytically solved in this ( pseudo - fixed point ) limit  @xcite , and are consistent with a tree - level @xmath145 only if @xmath146 . in this case , the light charginos / neutralinos are predominantly wino / bino , not higgsino , and @xmath12 will approach the sm value .",
    "therefore , these so(10)-type models appear to not be able to yield @xmath12 within @xmath3 of experiment , regardless of the gut - scale structure of the soft - breaking terms .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated a type of no - lose theorem for direct observation of susy partners at either lep  ii or upgraded tevatron .",
    "the central assumption for this theorem is that the actual values of @xmath12 and @xmath0 lie at or above their @xmath3 lower bounds .    by coupling these measurements to the requirement of perturbative validity of the yukawa couplings up to a gut - like scale , we derived bounds on charginos and top squarks leading one to conclude that one or both should be directly observed at lep  ii with @xmath147 , and at an upgraded ( in luminosity ) tevatron , for any susy breaking and any ( perturbative ) @xmath6 .",
    "we also pointed out the existence of interesting bounds on @xmath6 if the lower bound on charginos could be pushed up a little from its current value .",
    "of course , these bounds may never be saturated .",
