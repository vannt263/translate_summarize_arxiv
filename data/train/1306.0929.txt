    "<S> we solve a long standing open problem concerning the structure of finite cycles in the category @xmath0 of finitely generated modules over an arbitrary artin algebra @xmath1 , that is , the chains of homomorphisms @xmath2 between indecomposable modules in @xmath0 which do not belong to the infinite radical of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we describe completely the structure of an arbitrary module category @xmath0 whose all cycles are finite . </S>",
    "<S> the main structural results of the paper allow to derive several interesting combinatorial and homological properties of indecomposable modules lying on finite cycles . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we prove that for all but finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules @xmath3 lying on finite cycles of a  module category @xmath0 the euler characteristic of @xmath3 is well defined and nonnegative . as an another application of these results we obtain a characterization of all cycle - finite module categories @xmath0 having only a  finite number of functorially finite torsion classes . </S>",

    "<S> \\0 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction    throughout the paper , by an algebra is meant an artin algebra over a fixed commutative artin ring @xmath4 , which we shall assume ( without loss of generality ) to be basic and indecomposable . for an algebra @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath0 the category of finitely generated right @xmath1-modules and by @xmath5 the full subcategory of @xmath0 formed by the indecomposable modules . </S>",
    "<S> the jacobson radical @xmath6 of @xmath0 is the ideal generated by all nonisomorphisms between modules in @xmath5 , and the infinite radical @xmath7 of @xmath0 is the intersection of all powers @xmath8 , @xmath9 , of @xmath6 . by a result of auslander @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 if and only if @xmath1 is of finite representation type , that is , @xmath5 admits only a finite number of pairwise nonisomorphic modules ( see also @xcite for an alternative proof of this result ) . on the other hand , if @xmath1 is of infinite representation type then @xmath11 , by a result proved in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important combinatorial and homological invariant of the module category @xmath0 of an algebra @xmath1 is its auslander - reiten quiver @xmath12 . recall that @xmath12 is a valued translation quiver whose vertices are the isomorphism classes @xmath13 of modules @xmath14 in @xmath5 , the arrows correspond to irreducible homomorphisms between modules in @xmath5 , and the translation is the auslander - reiten translation @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall not distinguish between a module in @xmath14 in @xmath5 and the corresponding vertex @xmath13 of @xmath12 . if @xmath1 is an algebra of finite representation type , </S>",
    "<S> then every nonzero nonisomorphism in @xmath5 is a finite sum of composition of irreducible homomorphisms between modules in @xmath5 , and hence we may recover @xmath0 from the translation quiver @xmath12 . in general , @xmath12 describes only the quotient category @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath1 be an algebra and @xmath3 a module in @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> we note that @xmath3 is an indecomposable module over @xmath17 . clearly </S>",
    "<S> , we may realistically hope to describe the structure of @xmath17 only for modules @xmath3 having some distinguished properties .    a prominent role in the representation theory of algebras </S>",
    "<S> is played by cycles of indecomposable modules ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall that a _ cycle _ in @xmath5 is a sequence @xmath23 of nonzero nonisomorphisms in @xmath5 @xcite , and such a cycle is said to be _ finite _ if the homomorphisms @xmath24 do not belong to @xmath25 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . following ringel @xcite , a module @xmath3 in @xmath5 which does not lie on a cycle in @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is called _ directing_. the following two important results on directing modules were established by ringel in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , if @xmath1 is an algebra with all modules in @xmath5 being directing , then @xmath1 is of finite representation type . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the support algebra @xmath17 of a directing module @xmath3 over an algebra @xmath1 is a tilted algebra @xmath26 , for a hereditary algebra @xmath27 and a tilting module @xmath28 in @xmath29 , and @xmath3 is isomorphic to the image @xmath30 of an indecomposable injective module @xmath31 in @xmath29 via the functor @xmath32 . in particular , it follows that , if @xmath1 is an algebra of infinite representation type , then @xmath5 always contains a cycle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been proved independently by peng and xiao @xcite and skowroski @xcite that the auslander - reiten quiver @xmath12 of an algebra @xmath1 admits at most finitely many @xmath33-orbits containing directing modules . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in order to obtain information on the support algebras @xmath17 of nondirecting modules in @xmath5 , it is natural to study properties of cycles in @xmath5 containing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a module @xmath3 in @xmath5 is said to be _ cycle - finite _ if @xmath3 is nondirecting and every cycle in @xmath5 passing through @xmath3 is finite . obviously , every indecomposable module over an algebra of finite representation type is cycle - finite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of cycle - finite indecomposable modules over algebras of infinite representation type are provided by all indecomposable modules in the stable tubes of tame hereditary algebras @xcite , canonical algebras @xcite , @xcite , or more generally concealed canonical algebras @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following assem and skowroski @xcite , @xcite , an algebra @xmath1 is said to be _ cycle - finite _ if all cycles in @xmath5 are finite . </S>",
    "<S> the class of cycle - finite algebras is wide and contains the following distinguished classes of algebras : the algebras of finite representation type , the tame tilted algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the tame double tilted algebras @xcite , the tame generalized double tilted algebras @xcite , the tubular algebras @xcite , @xcite , the iterated tubular algebras @xcite , the tame quasi - tilted algebras @xcite , @xcite , the tame generalized multicoil algebras @xcite , the algebras with cycle - finite derived categories @xcite , and the strongly simply connected algebras of polynomial growth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that a selfinjective algebra @xmath1 is cycle - finite if and only if @xmath1 is of finite representation type @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , frequently an algebra @xmath1 admits a galois covering @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a cycle - finite locally bounded category and @xmath36 is an admissible group of automorphisms of @xmath35 , which allows to reduce the representation theory of @xmath1 to the representation theory of cycle - finite algebras being finite convex subcategories of @xmath35 ( see @xcite and @xcite for some general results ) . for example , every finite dimensional selfinjective algebra @xmath1 of polynomial growth over an algebraically closed field @xmath4 admits a canonical standard form @xmath37 ( geometric socle deformation of @xmath1 ) such that @xmath37 has a galois covering @xmath38 , where @xmath35 is a cycle - finite selfinjective locally bounded category and @xmath36 is an admissible infinite cyclic group of automorphisms of @xmath35 , the auslander - reiten quiver @xmath39 of @xmath37 is the orbit quiver @xmath40 of @xmath41 , and the stable auslander - reiten quivers of @xmath1 and @xmath37 are isomorphic ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some general results on the structure of cycle - finite algebras and their module categories .    in the paper we are concerned with the problem of describing the support algebras of cycle - finite modules over arbitrary ( artin ) algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this may be considered as a natural extension of the problem concerning the structure of support algebras of directing modules , solved by ringel in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the directing modules in @xmath5 may be viewed as modules @xmath3 in @xmath5 for which every oriented cycle of nonzero homomorphisms in @xmath5 containing @xmath3 consists entirely of isomorphisms . </S>",
    "<S> the considered problem , initiated more than 25 years ago in @xcite , turned out to be very difficult , and many researchers involved to its solution resigned . </S>",
    "<S> the main obstacle for solution of this problem was the large complexity of finite cycles of indecomposable modules and the fact that all cycles of indecomposable modules over algebras of finite representation type are finite . </S>",
    "<S> the main results of the paper show that new classes of algebras and complete understanding of the structure of their module categories were necessary for the solution of the considered problem . </S>",
    "<S> we will outline now our approach towards solution of the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath1 be an algebra and @xmath3 be a cycle - finite module in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> then every cycle in @xmath5 passing through @xmath3 has a refinement to a cycle of irreducible homomorphisms in @xmath5 containing @xmath3 and consequently @xmath3 lies on an oriented cycle in the auslander - reiten quiver @xmath12 of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> following malicki and skowroski @xcite , we denote by @xmath42 the _ cyclic quiver _ of @xmath1 obtained from @xmath12 by removing all acyclic vertices ( vertices not lying on oriented cycles in @xmath12 ) and the arrows attached to them . </S>",
    "<S> then the connected components of the translation quiver @xmath42 are said to be _ </S>",

    "<S> it has been proved in @xcite that two modules @xmath14 and @xmath43 in @xmath5 belong to the same cyclic component of @xmath12 if and only if there is an oriented cycle in @xmath12 passing through @xmath14 and @xmath43 . for a cyclic component @xmath44 of @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a decomposition @xmath45 of @xmath1 in @xmath0 such that the simple summands of the semisimple module @xmath46 are exactly the simple composition factors of indecomposable modules in @xmath44 , the ideal @xmath47 in @xmath1 generated by the images of all homomorphisms from @xmath48 to @xmath1 in @xmath0 , and call the quotient algebra @xmath49 the _ support algebra _ of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> observe now that @xmath3 belongs to a unique cyclic component @xmath50 of @xmath12 consisting entirely of cycle - finite indecomposable modules , and the support algebra @xmath17 of @xmath3 is a quotient algebra of the support algebra @xmath51 of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> a cyclic component @xmath44 of @xmath12 containing a cycle - finite module is said to be a cycle - finite cyclic component of @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> the support algebra @xmath17 of a cycle - finite module @xmath3 in @xmath5 is not necessarily an algebra of the form @xmath56 for an idempotent @xmath57 of @xmath1 ( see section [ exs - fin ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the main results of the paper provide a conceptual description of the support algebras of cycle - finite cyclic components of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the description splits into two cases . in the case when a cycle - finite cyclic component @xmath44 of @xmath12 is infinite , we prove that @xmath52 is a suitable gluing of finitely many generalized multicoil algebras ( introduced by malicki and skowroski in @xcite ) and algebras of finite representation type , and @xmath44 is the corresponding gluing of the associated cyclic generalized multicoils via finite translation quivers . </S>",
    "<S> in the second case when a cycle - finite cyclic component @xmath44 is finite , we prove that @xmath52 is a generalized double tilted algebra ( in the sense of reiten and skowroski @xcite ) and @xmath44 is the core of the connecting component of this algebra .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to mention that the generalized multicoil algebras form a prominent class of algebras of global dimension at most 3 , containing the class of quasitilted algebras of canonical type , and are obtained by sophisticated gluings of concealed canonical algebras using admissible algebra operations , generalizing the coil operations proposed by assem and skowroski in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized double tilted algebras form a distinguished class of algebras , containing all tilted algebras and all algebras of finite representation type , and can be viewed as two - sided gluings of tilted algebras . </S>",
    "<S> the tilted algebras and quasitilted algebras of canonical type were under intensive investigation over the last two decades by many representation theory algebraists . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the main results of the paper give a good understanding of the support algebras of cycle - finite cyclic components . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the results and examples presented in the paper create new interesting open problems and research directions ( see section [ main ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> [ main ] we present the main results of the paper and related background . in section [ cyccomp ] </S>",
    "<S> we describe properties of cyclic components of the auslander - reiten quivers of algebras , applied in the proofs of the main theorems . </S>",
    "<S> sections [ pfth1 ] , [ pfth2 ] and [ pfthm10 ] are devoted to the proofs of theorems [ thm1 ] , [ thm2 ] and [ thm10 ] , respectively . in sections [ exs - inf ] and [ exs - fin ] we present new types of examples , illustrating the main results of the paper .    for basic background on the representation theory applied here we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    </S>",
