    "however , the natural generalizations of gadgets like the alexander polynomial or ideal can be computed for @xmath0-knots . in @xcite , c. giller proposed a definition for an invariant we will call @xmath13 .",
    "the proposed invariant is derived from a kind of skein relation on the projection to @xmath2 of a @xmath0-knot analogous to the conway skein relation for projections of @xmath14-knots to @xmath15 . for a certain class of @xmath0-knots , @xmath13 is known to compute the alexander polynomial .",
    "this relation , which we discuss more thoroughly in section  [ sec : giller ] , always results in a symmetric polynomial .",

    "further complicating matters is that giller s polynomial was not actually known to be an invariant .",
    "if instead of @xmath0-knots , we look at `` twins '' in @xmath1 , we have objects to which gauge - theoretic methods can be applied .",

    "this decomposes @xmath37 the boundaries of normal discs @xmath38 to @xmath18 refine the decomposition to @xmath39 .    with this decomposition in mind , we define a standard surgery for a twin @xmath33 in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath40 where @xmath41 identifies the @xmath42 from @xmath20 with @xmath35 . up to isotopy , any two such @xmath43 differ by a diffeomorphism @xmath44 .",
    "since any such map extends over @xmath21 , the resulting manifold only depends on the embedding of the twin . also , @xmath45 so that the @xmath0-torus core , @xmath46 , of the surgery is identified with @xmath47 as a homology class .",

    "if we take @xmath33 to be the standard twins , then this construction _ is _ independent of the choice of @xmath6s and provides a handy method for studying @xmath0-knots via twins .",
    "this independence is due to the existence of a orientation preserving diffeomorphism @xmath92 of @xmath1 which interchanges @xmath18 in standard twins .",
    "the diffeomorphism @xmath92 is constructed as follows : view @xmath1 as @xmath93 .",

    "the annulus @xmath133 in @xmath134 is obtained by taking the union of @xmath135 .",
    "this annulus descends to a knotted @xmath6 , @xmath95 , in @xmath136 .",
    "together with @xmath90 , the image of @xmath137 , we form a twin .",
    "we call @xmath95 the @xmath138-twist spin of @xmath4 and write @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the associated twin .    as with the artin spin , the first sphere , @xmath90 , bounds @xmath141 in @xmath1 .",

    "this provides an interesting example of twins in which both @xmath0-knots are unknots but with the twins being knotted as an interchangable pair .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "similar to the twist spin , this construction involves a deformation of a knotted arc @xmath104 in @xmath105 fixing the north and south poles which returns the arc to the starting point .",
    "take a international date line of @xmath106 union @xmath104 and push it into @xmath146 so that it is null homologous . call this @xmath104 . then consider the @xmath14-parameter family of diffeomorphisms given by pushing a base point @xmath147 @xmath138 times along @xmath104 .",
    "the return map @xmath43 is then a diffeomorphism of the quadruple @xmath148 which is the identity on all but the first component .",

    "the roll spinning construction is due to fox who , in @xcite , showed that , for @xmath155 , the knotted @xmath0-sphere @xmath95 coming from the deformed arc is not isotopic to any @xmath138-twist spun knot . in this case , the @xmath14-roll spin had a corresponding visualization , duplicated in figure  [ fig : foxroll ] , of the motion of @xmath156 in @xmath105 which explains why the word `` roll '' was chosen to describe this construction .",
    "note that both twist and roll spinning can be described in terms of certain diffeomorphisms of @xmath105 which keep @xmath106 and @xmath104 fixed identically . with this in mind",

    "we say that a 2-knot @xmath4 is ribbon if it is formed by the following construction : let @xmath180 ( bases ) , @xmath181 ( bands ) each be embedded in @xmath182 with @xmath183 .",

    "we can define ribbon surfaces of arbitrary genus in the same manner .",

    "the @xmath205 case is the same but with orientations reversed on @xmath206 , giving us a negative hopf link cone boundary .    in this case",
    "we say that @xmath33 is a _ ribbon twin_.    it is known that of the deform spun knots , only the artin and 1-twist spun knots are ribbon .",

    "artin spun twins are known to be ribbon but it is not known to the author if 1-twist spun twins are ribbon .",
    "two ribbon presentations are _ stably equivalent _ if they are equivalent under the following operations .",
    "addition of a trivial base / band pair , sliding the disc to which a band attaches ( band slide ) , and moving a ribbon intersection along a base / band sequence ( band pass ) are shown in figure  [ fig : band - stabilization ] and together with isotopy generate _ stable equivalence _ of ribbon presentations .",
    "clearly stable equivalence of ribbon presentations generates isotopies of the corresponding ribbon knot but the converse also holds  isotopic ribbon knots have stably equivalent ribbon presentations . for a proof of this ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it will occasionally be easier to deal with simplified ribbon presentations .",
    "let @xmath207 be the graph which has vertices corresponding to bases and edges given by bands , connected in the natural way .",
    "it is clear that @xmath208 is the genus of the ribbon surface specified by the ribbon presentation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the ribbon surface is a sphere or torus .",
    "suppose that @xmath209 has a vertex @xmath147 of valence @xmath25 or greater .",

    "continue this procedure until we arrive at a graph @xmath212 ( and corresponding ribbon presentation ) for which each vertex has valence at most @xmath0 . then , as cell complexes , @xmath212 is either an interval or a circle as the ribbon surface is a sphere or a torus",
    ". we will call such ribbon presentations _ linear_.    consider the connect sum of a ribbon @xmath0-knot @xmath88 with standard twins @xmath89 .",
    "standard twins have a simple ribbon presentation given by two bases and a band each .",
    "( each base is for one of the twin intersection points . )",
    "stabilize the band in @xmath90 by switching it for two bands and a base .",
    "then the connect sum @xmath213 is formed by adding a band from the new base of @xmath88 to any of the terminal bases in a ribbon presentation of @xmath90 .      in the study of knots in @xmath2 , a generic projections to @xmath15 , together with crossing information , completely determines the isotopy type of a knot .",
    "similarly , there is a theory for decorated projections for twins and surfaces in @xmath214 which determines their embedding up to isotopy .",
    "giller proves , in @xcite , that if @xmath27 is a surface in @xmath182 , then up to isotopy @xmath27 admits a projection to @xmath2 with only double and triple points exist .",

    "see figure  [ fig : dbltrpl - pt ] . in the same paper",
    ", he gives methods of decorating these projections with over  middle  under crossing information and a way of determining if an arbitrary set of crossing information gives a lift of such an immersion of a surface in @xmath2 to an embedding in @xmath182 .",

    "not all twins or surfaces have such a projection and those that do are said to be _",
    "simply knotted_. first examples of simply knotted @xmath0-knots include artin spun knots and ribbon @xmath0-knots . for artin spun knots , we can get a projection with no triple points by doing the same spinning construction ( one dimension down ) to the projection to @xmath15 of the original , classical knot .",
    "this creates an @xmath215s worth of double points for each crossing in the classical knot s projection .",
    "we will call a twin @xmath89 simply knotted if both @xmath19 are simply knotted and pairwise have no triple points .",
    "ribbon knots have embedded projections away from the ribbon singularities  the intersections of the interiors of bands with interiors of the bases .",
    "( this is in contrast with ribbon @xmath14-knots , for which projections of non - intersecting bands may have crossings .",
    "the analogous situation for @xmath0-knots is an under / over crossing of the whole band  which does not result in a crossing in the projection to @xmath2 . )",
    "nearby the ribbon singularities , we have projections which appear as in figure  [ fig : ribbon - sing ] .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that all simply knotted @xmath6s are ribbon .",
    "s of double points . ]    when we have a @xmath215 family of double points , we have local neighborhoods around each which appear as in the first picture in figure  [ fig : dbltrpl - pt ] .",
    "this gives the neighborhood of the family the structure of an bundle over @xmath215 .",
    "as the surfaces in @xmath182 are orientable and the two preimages of the double points are separated , the monodromy must be trivial .",
    "this means that , local to the @xmath215 family of double points , the projection is that of a classical knot crossing times @xmath215 .",
    "then , for a simply knotted projection of a ( oriented ) surface in @xmath182 , it is sufficient to label one of the surfaces as being over crossing at each family of double points .",

    "-knot with alexander polynomial @xmath216 and giller polynomial @xmath217    for a twin , a few additional pieces of information are needed .",
    "we need to keep track of the two intersection points of the spheres . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the neighborhood of each is diffeomorphic to the cone on a positive or negative hopf link .",
    "then the ( undecorated ) projection of such a neighborhood appears as does a neighborhood of double points .",
    "we decorate the projection with a solid dot to indicate the intersection point of the @xmath6s and @xmath218 signs to indicate over / under crossings on the double point arcs which emanate from it .",
    "we switch from over to under at the intersection of the spheres in twins .",
    "see figure  [ fig : twin - int ]          in @xcite , satoh showed how to represent ribbon surfaces of genus @xmath219 and @xmath14 in @xmath182 by means of virtual knots / links .",
    "for our purposes , a virtual knot ( or link ) is a diagram in @xmath15 of embedded , oriented arcs which end either at `` crossings '' as in the ( top ) first two pictures in figure  [ fig : virtual - knot ] or at endpoints as in the ( top ) third picture .",
    "each such diagram corresponds to a collection of immersed surfaces in @xmath2 by replacing each of the crossings and endpoints in figure  [ fig : virtual - knot ] with the corresponding surfaces in @xmath2 shown .",
    "these are then connected via tubes parallel to the embedded arcs .",
    "thus , any virtual link corresponds to the projection , with crossing information , of a collection of ribbon @xmath0-spheres and tori in @xmath182 .    ]",
    "conversely , linear ribbon presentations of knots correspond to virtual knots . take a projection of @xmath220 having only double points at ribbon singularities .",
    "for each band in the linear ribbon presentation , consider the image of its core in @xmath2 extended to the center of the bases to which the band attaches .",
    "this gives an immersed ( at ribbon singularities ) arc @xmath104 in @xmath2 .",
    "taking a generic projection @xmath221 we get an arc @xmath222 immersed in @xmath15 with two kinds of singularities :    * double points of the projection @xmath223 and * projections of immersion points @xmath224 .",
    "each of the first kind of double point corresponds to a virtual crossing . for the second kind of crossing we must first consider a diversion about orientations .",
    "the endpoints of @xmath222 each correspond to a base with only one band attached  here , @xmath4 locally consists of the discs @xmath225 . with a fixed orientation on @xmath4 ,",
    "we orient the boundary of the @xmath188 with the outward normal .",

    "this orients @xmath222 .",
    "then , with @xmath222 oriented , we can check that the second type of immersion point corresponds to the ribbon intersection in figure  [ fig : virtual - knot ] .",
    "if it does not ( i.e. the two crossings have the opposite under / over information ) then perform the isotopy in figure  [ fig : vk - fix ] .",
    "once this has been done , we may use our correspondence from figure  [ fig : virtual - knot ] to label each of the immersion points of @xmath222 as virtual knot crossings .",
    "in addition to the `` classical '' reidemeister moves in figure  [ fig : classical - reidemeister ] , associated to a virtual knot , we have the series of `` virtual '' reidemeister moves in figure  [ fig : virt - reidemeister ] giving allowable isotopies .",
    "notice that move d is one of the forbidden moves of the virtual knots of kauffman .",
    "the type of virtual knot we consider here is sometimes referred to a being _ weakly _ virtual but in the spirit of brevity we will omit `` weakly '' in this paper .",
    "these concepts of virtual knots are inequivalent as there are virtual knots , in the sense of kauffman , which are knotted and which , when move d is allowed , are unknotted .",
    "such an example is given in @xcite .",

    "fig : hoste3 ] . applying the version of the @xmath318 hoste move from section  [ sec : torus - torus ]",
    ", we get a local picture equal to that in the right hand side of figure  [ fig : hoste3 ] .",
    "the tori in this picture are each isotopic to the torus @xmath349  where @xmath350 is the normal bundle to @xmath19 , the knots which comprise @xmath324 .",
    "this torus can also be described as one of the components of @xmath351 . in the fiber sum manifold ,",
    "@xmath338 , each torus we have just described is isotopic to the fiber @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath338 is diffeomorphic to @xmath352 .",
    "therefore , @xmath353 so @xmath354 and @xmath355 so @xmath343      recall the definition of giller s polynomial given by equations ( [ eq : giller - conway - relation ] ) , ( [ eq : giller - unknot - relation ] ) , and ( [ eq : giller - split - relation ] ) .",
    "these are the conway - style relation , the value on the unknotted sphere , and the vanishing of the polynomial for split links , respectively .",
    "we now discuss similar results for our invariant .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 and @xmath76 are ribbon with a virtual knot presentation which is split or only has pairwise virtual crossings . then using the virtual reidemeister moves of figures  [ fig : virt - reidemeister ] and  [ fig : reidemeister - move - f ] , we can separate @xmath33 and @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the projections of @xmath33 and @xmath76 are separated by an @xmath103 .",
    "so @xmath33 and @xmath76 are separated by an @xmath103 .",
    "this means that the manifold formed by surgering @xmath33 and @xmath76 is a connected sum .",
    "now , on the @xmath76 side of the connected sum , the intersection form on @xmath357 will be a hyperbolic pair as will the intersection form on the side given by surgery on @xmath33 .",
    "thus we are given a manifold which is the connected sum of two manifolds each with @xmath358 .",
    "therefore , the seiberg - witten invariant of this surgery vanishes .",
    "it follows that @xmath359 and that @xmath360    now let us consider the conway - style relation for giller s polynomial we initially discussed in section  [ sec : giller ] .",
    "this relation involves crossing changes and resolution at individual loops of double points .",
    "now , in our crossing change surgery , we had a similar action of changing the lower crossing from figure  [ fig : ribbon - sing - isotope ] .",
    "in the diagrams for our @xmath318 hoste move , we took a different local projection to illustrate the appropriate surgery .",
    "however , smoothing the lower crossing from figure  [ fig : ribbon - sing - isotope ] also yields a smoothing in the virtual knot diagram .    in other words , selecting a particular set of double points to apply the relation in equation  ( [ eq : giller - conway - relation ] ) to , @xmath361 computes @xmath362 .",
    "therefore , @xmath363 for ribbon knots .",
    "we can not make a stronger statement of equality however , as the relation from equation  ( [ eq : giller - conway - relation ] ) allows us to move into configurations of surfaces which are inaccessible to the invariant @xmath339 .        now suppose that @xmath89 is ribbon with a virtual knot presentation which only has virtual crossings .",
    "then we can use the virtual reidemeister moves @xmath302 and @xmath48 from figures  [ fig : virt - reidemeister ] and  [ fig : reidemeister - move - f ] to completely unknot the diagram for @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , @xmath364 and so @xmath365 .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 is a twin possibly with accompanying torus @xmath76 with the configuration ribbon .",
    "suppose that we reverse the orientation of one of the @xmath19 or of @xmath76 .",
    "this reverses the orientation of the torus @xmath78 ( or @xmath306 ) and induces a chance in homology orientation from the change of sign in pairing with @xmath78 . then , if @xmath366 , @xmath367 .",
    "similarly , @xmath368 .    currently , the author is unaware if crossings can be chosen so that the tree of terminates in standard twins and unlinked twin / torus pairs .",
    "the previous work of fintushel and stern guarantees that the process terminates when @xmath90 in @xmath89 is knotted with only classical crossings and @xmath95 is unknotted with no ribbon intersections with @xmath90 .",
    "the presence of virtual crossings in the diagrams complicates the general case .",
    "additionally , the author has yet to find a general method of dealing with ribbon intersections between the @xmath19 .",
    "however , there seem to be a fairly large number of new examples which we may compute using the current tools .",
    "the first we will compute is the twin version of the example from giller s paper . call this twin @xmath369",
    "this was encountered previously in figure  [ fig : giller - twin ] .",
    "follow the computation through figures  [ fig : computation - giller - twin ] , [ fig : computation - giller - twin2 ] , [ fig : computation - giller - twin3 ] , and [ fig : computation - giller - twin4 ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : computation - giller - twin4 ] , we arrive at configurations @xmath370 and @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath244 and @xmath48 are isotopic to standard twins , so @xmath371 .",
    "the other configurations @xmath372 differ by the orientation of the torus and so @xmath373 .",
    "therefore , @xmath374            now let us look at the twin in figure  [ fig : unknot - pair - twin ] , a twin in which both @xmath0-knots are unknots but which pairwise have ribbon intersections .",
    "call this twin @xmath375 .",
    "our current tools do not allow us to deal directly with pairwise ribbon intersections .",
    "follow the computation through figures  [ fig : unknot - pair - twin1 ] , [ fig : unknot - pair - twin2 ] , and [ fig : unknot - pair - twin3 ] .",
    "we arrive at configurations @xmath376 and @xmath269 . here",
    "@xmath377 and @xmath269 are isotopic to standard twins , so @xmath378 .",
    "the other configurations @xmath4 contains a separated torus so @xmath379 .",
    "therefore , @xmath380    finally , we remark on uniqueness and related topics . in what is our",
    "artin spun case , fintushel and stern have conjectured that their knot surgery construction yields nondiffeomorphic manifolds for `` essentially different '' knots .",
    "( here , `` essentially different '' means that two knots are not isotopic , they are not mirrors , nor they isotopic under mirroring of connect - summands . ) the alexander polynomial does not completely distinguish knots however , so the seiberg - witten invariants in their current form do not shed any light on their conjecture .",
    "similarly , it seems doubtful that the manifolds @xmath381 and @xmath382 are diffeomorphic , but with the seiberg - witten invariants being equal , we have no obvious way in which to distinguish them .",
    "in particular , it seems possible that @xmath382 is diffeomorphic to @xmath383 where @xmath117 is the artin spin of the left handed trefoil .    also",
