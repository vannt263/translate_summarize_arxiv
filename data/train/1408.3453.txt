    "similar to the k - doping effect , the magnetic state of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 varies with pressure from antiferromagnetic ( af ) to superconducting , and finally to nonmagnetic @xcite , while its structure changes from an  uncollapsed tetragonal \" ( uc@xmath6 ) phase , an orthorhombic phase , and a  collapsed tetragonal \" ( c@xmath6 ) phase @xcite . here , in the collapsed phase ,",

    "the zf - spectrum for caco@xmath3p@xmath3 exhibits a clear oscillation due to the formation of static af order below @xmath12k , as reported by neutron diffraction measurements @xcite .",
    "however , according to the detailed analysis , it was found that the zf - spectrum consists of two muon - spin precession signals with different frequencies [ @xmath35mhz and @xmath36mhz at 2  k ] . as @xmath6 increases from 2  k ,",
    "the two signals disappeared at @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that there are two magnetically different muon sites in the caco@xmath3p@xmath3 lattice .",
    "although a clear oscillation is also observed in the zf - spectrum for sr@xmath38ca@xmath39co@xmath3p@xmath3 , the initial phase ( @xmath40 ) was found to delay by @xmath41 , when we attempted to fit the oscillatory signal by an exponential relaxing cosine function : @xmath42 .",
    "this implies the wide distribution of an internal field at the muon site(s ) .",
    "the most probable reason is that the magnetic order is incommensurate ( ic ) to the lattice @xcite .",
    "this is because , due to the mismatch of the period between the muon site(s ) and magnetic order , ic order always provides an oscillatory signal with wide field distribution in the zf-@xmath0sr spectrum .",
    "but , the other explanation is also available , as in the case for ag@xmath3nio@xmath3 @xcite and licro@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , neutron diffraction measurements is required for further clarifying the magnetic nature of the @xmath9 sample .    for sr@xmath43ca@xmath43co@xmath3p@xmath3 , the zf - spectrum shows a static kubo - toyabe - type relaxation . since the field distribution width ( @xmath33 )",

    "furthermore , weal transverse field @xmath0sr measurements revealed the appearance of a large internal magnetic field below @xmath46k .",
    "therefore , the ground state of sr@xmath43ca@xmath43co@xmath3p@xmath3 is most likely a spin - glass like state , although it is more preferable to measure ac-@xmath21 to confirm the spin - glass state .",
    "the situation for sr@xmath32ca@xmath31co@xmath3p@xmath3 was the same to that for sr@xmath43ca@xmath43co@xmath3p@xmath3 .    on the other hand , for the samples with @xmath47 , the zf - spectrum exhibits an almost static kt behavior even at 2  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zflf ] ) , but @xmath48s@xmath49oe ) .",
    "this is a typical value for nuclear magnetic fields at the muon site(s ) , and for this case , the origin is mainly due to the nuclear magnetic moment of @xmath50co .",
    "hence , the ground state for sr@xmath1ca@xmath2co@xmath3p@xmath3 with @xmath47 is assigned to be a pauli - paramagnet .",
    "based on these results , the magnetic phase diagram for sr@xmath1ca@xmath2co@xmath3p@xmath3 was determined ( fig .  [",

    "that is , thanks to a unique power of @xmath0sr , the phase with @xmath51 was found to be not an fm phase @xcite but an incommensurate ( ic ) afm phase .",
    "then , next to the ic - afm phase , a spin - glass ( sg ) like phase appears in the @xmath5 range between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the samples with @xmath47 was found to be nonmagnetic down to 2  k. however , since the phase boundaries between c and ic , between ic and sg , and sg and pm are still not clarified .",
