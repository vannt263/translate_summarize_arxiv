    "inclusions placed in an elastic medium usually deform it , and experience mediated interactions as the total elastic free energy depends on their separation .",

    "a casimir - like effect adds up , which is due to the coupling between the boundary conditions and the fluctuations of the medium  @xcite . while these effects are rather well understood , the _ dynamics _ of elastically  mediated interactions remains a challenging subject .",
    "mobile inclusions couple to the dynamics of the elastic medium , which produces non trivial effects  @xcite , as in the dynamics of fluctuation - induced forces  @xcite    here , we investigate the dynamics of the force exchanged between two fixed but active inclusions , that are simultaneously triggered . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the inclusions impose no deformation to the medium , either they are outside the medium , or they are in a state in which they do not couple with its elastic field . at @xmath1 , they are triggered , i.e.  they actively change state or insert into the medium , and they start to impose an elastic deformation .",
    "we consider two limiting cases : ( i ) soft , linear inclusions , and ( ii ) hard , non - linear inclusions . in the former case , the inclusions couple linearly to the elastic field with a _",
    "constant force_. it is then the competition with the medium that sets the amplitude of the deformation . in the latter case ,",
    "the inclusions couple non - linearly with the elastic field in such a way that they impose a _",
    "constant deformation_. in both cases , we assume that the time scale associated with the switching of the inclusions is much shorter than the response time of the system ; in other words the switching of the inclusions is assumed to be instantaneous .",
    "these are realistic situations : membrane proteins , for instance , may switch upon binding of atp from a non - curving cylindrical shape to a curving conical one  @xcite .",
    "either the protein opens - up with a finite force , or it abruptly changes its shape and imposes a local membrane curvature . for membranes proteins ,",
    "the latter case is more realistic , as proteins are much stiffer that the surrounding membrane .",
    "assuming an instantaneous shape change is also a very good approximation , since the dynamics of the membrane is much slower than that of the protein at distances comparable with inter - protein distances  @xcite .",

    "the casimir component @xmath114 is given by  ( [ fc ] ) , and it can be derived from the correlation function .",

    "we thus have dirichlet conditions in @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the fluctuating field @xmath43 at positive times , while there are no boundary conditions at negative times .",
    "there is no need , actually , to calculate @xmath115 . since the model is gaussian , the fourier modes @xmath119 are independent .",
    "they are thermally equilibrated at @xmath4 , then , at @xmath1 all the modes that do not satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions are suddenly removed while the other remain thermally equilibrated .",
    "it follows that the casimir interaction jumps abruptly from 0 to its equilibrium value : @xmath120 note that this situation differs from that discussed in  @xcite , where the dynamics of the casimir force is calculated for a system prepared in the frozen state @xmath121 at time @xmath1 . to calculate the equilibrium value of the casimir force , we have used the method of li and kardar  @xcite :",
    "the static correlation function of the field free of boundary conditions is @xmath122 , which yields the casimir energy @xmath123 $ ] and the casimir force @xmath124 by differentiation with respect to  @xmath3 .",

    "the behaviors of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are shown in figure  [ last]@xmath97 for @xmath113 ( i.e.  a few percent ) .",
    "let us first discuss the case ( i ) of soft , linear inclusions ( dashed curves in figure  [ last]@xmath97 ) . for @xmath129 , we expect scaling laws , as the characteristic lengths and times are irrelevant .",
    "indeed , in this regime the force is well approximated by @xmath130 , which can be deduced from ( [ forcemou ] ) by setting @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "it follows that @xmath133 with @xmath134 ^ 2 , \\quad d_+=\\left[2\\,\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(1-p)\\right]^2\\simeq\\pi p^2.\\ ] ] for @xmath113 one obtains @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "note that in figure  [ last]@xmath97 the regime @xmath137 is apparent , while the regime @xmath138 occurs at values of @xmath3 smaller than those displayed . in the opposite regime @xmath139 , where there are no scaling laws ,",
    "the force at large times is well approximated by the first term of ( [ forcemou ] ) , i.e.  @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath141 where @xmath142 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath113 one obtains @xmath143 .",
    "the establishment of the force therefore lasts @xmath144 in this regime .",
    "let us now turn to the case ( ii ) of hard , non - linear inclusions .",
    "first of all , for @xmath139 , we notice on figure  [ last]@xmath97 that the curves @xmath145 are superimposed on the dashed ones of case ( i ) .",
    "they are therefore given by  ( [ tapeqlgrand ] ) .",
    "indeed , whatever the inclusion type , the deformation profiles are already well established in this regime when their tails start to overlap . in the range of values @xmath129 that we have explored , @xmath127 is well fitted numerically by a power law @xmath146 ; we found @xmath147 ( instead of @xmath148 ) , which seems to be independent of @xmath149 in the range @xmath150 $ ] .",
    "a more detailed numerical study would be required , however , to discuss seriously this scaling law .",
    "conversely , the time @xmath112 at which the force maximum occurs is found numerically to follow an analytic power - law : @xmath151 with @xmath152 . as for the equilibration time , we find numerically @xmath128 of order unity for @xmath105 , with @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "in other words , the equilibration time is set by the field s own timescale , even when the inclusions are very close to each other .",
    "another characteristic feature of hard , non - linear inclusions is the existence of a discontinuity in @xmath128 , occuring at @xmath155 for @xmath113 ( see figure  [ last]@xmath97 ) .",
    "this discontinuity comes from the maximum of the force @xmath83 : if the latter is larger than @xmath156 then @xmath128 lies after the maximum , otherwise it lies before the maximum .",
    "overall , for @xmath105 , the force in the hard inclusions case appears sooner and equilibrates later than in the soft inclusions case .",
    "we showed that the mechanism by which active , switchable inclusions set their deformations in an elastic medium has important consequences on the dynamics of the force they exchange . in the example studied here , two inclusions instantaneously triggering their deformations may experience a transient mean - field force that can be hundreds of times larger than the equilibrium one .",
    "inclusions setting their deformations through an instantaneous force do not exhibit such a behavior .",
    "the timescales associated with the dynamics of the force are also largely affected by their switching mechanism .",
    "the existence of a high transient force for inclusions setting their deformation instantaneously ( i.e.  much quicker than the deformation of the medium ) should be a generic feature of elastically mediated interactions .",
    "it might have important consequences .",
    "for instance , two active inclusions tied to the medium by a link withstanding the equilibrium force could either break free , or remain attached , depending on the nature of their switching mechanism .",
