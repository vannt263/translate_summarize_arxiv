    "gravitational lensing studies have radically improved our understanding of the internal structure of galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , the combination of strong lensing with stellar dynamics or stellar population synthesis models has allowed to characterize some properties , previously almost unexplored , of the galaxy dark - matter haloes and sub - haloes .",
    "for example , it has become possible to measure the dark over total mass fraction and dark - matter halo density slope in the inner regions of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and to estimate the mass function of dark satellites ( also called substructure ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the spatial extent ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of galaxy dark - matter haloes .",
    "moreover , the same combinations of mass diagnostics have enabled to investigate the total mass density profile ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the origin of the tilt of the fundamental plane ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) of massive early - type galaxies and to use single lenses or statistical samples of them to infer cosmologically relevant quantities ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "taking advantage of the excellent data collected by the lenses structure and dynamics ( lsd ; @xcite ) , sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , cfht strong lensing in the legacy survey ( sl2s ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the analyses conducted so far have mainly examined the physical properties of isolated , massive early - type galaxies , acting as strong lenses on background sources .",
    "only more recently , thanks also to the cambridge and sloan survey of wide arcs in the sky ( cassowary ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , growing interest has been shown in the study of early - type lens galaxies residing in galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . despite the large amount of results published to date ,",
    "detailed strong lensing studies in `` small '' lens galaxies are still lacking , mostly because these systems are not observed frequently .",
    "one possibility to find more such systems is to look at clusters of galaxies , where , owing to the increase in the strong lensing cross section of a cluster member due to the presence of the extended mass distribution of the cluster , low - mass galaxies are more likely to produce strong lensing features than in less dense environments .",
    "investigations of these objects are particularly useful , as they can provide the necessary piece of information to elucidate what is the amount and distribution of dark matter in astrophysical objects extending from the lowest to the highest ends of the galaxy mass function",
    ". the comparison of these observational measurements over a wide range of physical scales with the outcomes of cosmological simulations can give fundamental clues about the precise nature of dark matter and the role played by the interaction of baryons and dark matter during the mass assembly of cosmological structures .",
    "the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ; go 12065 , pi postman ) was awarded 524 orbits of hubble space telescope ( hst ) time to observe 25 massive ( virial mass @xmath8-@xmath9 , x - ray temperature @xmath10 kev ) galaxy clusters in 16 broadband filters , ranging from approximately 2000 to 17000 @xmath11 with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ; @xcite ) and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sample , spanning a wide redshift range ( @xmath12 = 0.18 - 0.90 ) , was carefully chosen to be largely free of lensing bias and representative of relaxed clusters , on the basis of their symmetric and smooth x - ray emission profiles ( for a thorough overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "clash has four main scientific goals : 1 ) measure the cluster total mass profiles over a wide radial range , by means of strong and weak lensing analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 2 ) detect new type ia supernovae out to redshift z @xmath13 2.5 , to improve the constraints on the dark energy equation of state ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 3 ) discover and study some of the first galaxies that formed after the big bang ( z @xmath14 7 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 4 ) perform galaxy evolution analyses on cluster members and background galaxies .",
    "ancillary science that can surely be carried out with the superb data set of clash is the analysis of several new strong lensing systems on galaxy scale .",
    "a large programme ( 186.a-0798 , pi rosati ) of 225 hours with the vimos instrument at the very large telescope ( vlt ) has also been approved to perform a panoramic spectroscopic survey of the 14 clash clusters that are visible from eso - paranal ( rosati et al .",

    "we concentrate here on radial scales of a few kpc , where the total mass of the galaxies g1 and g2 is the main source of the gravitational potential and the mass of the cluster ( extended over a typical radial scale of 100 kpc ) is instead approximated and treated as a second - order term .",
    "we keep the model complexity to a minimum and describe the three main lenses , i.e. the two galaxies g1 and g2 and the cluster , in terms of either three singular isothermal spheres ( 3siss ) or two singular isothermal spheres and a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( 2siss+sie ) . the mass components are fixed to the luminosity centroids of the galaxies g1 and g2 and of the bcg ( the hypothesis of the center of mass of the cluster coinciding with that of the bcg is supported by the results of the studies cited in the previous paragraph ) and parametrized by angular scales ( labeled as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) , which represent the strength of the lenses and are equal to the values of the einstein angles in the spherical case .",

    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "the values of these parameters are consistent with those obtained from the thorough lensing analyses performed on the cluster scale by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    ", the best - fitting parameters for the sie model associated to the cluster component provide a total mass estimate of about @xmath62 projected within a cylinder of radius equal to 320 kpc ( the approximate average distance of the multiple images from the bcg luminosity center ) .",
    "given our simplified assumptions on the cluster total mass distribution , it is remarkable that this estimate is only approximately @xmath63 higher than those obtained in the previously cited lensing works and in the cluster dynamical analysis by @xcite .",
    "if one used otherwise the very crude approximation of the einstein radius of the cluster ( for a source at redshift 3.7 ) given by the average projected distance between the strong lensing system and the bcg luminosity centre , this would translate into a total projected mass that is more than 1.5 times larger than what obtained from the other cluster total mass diagnostics .",
    "several previous studies of strong lensing systems around galaxy cluster members ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have demonstrated that although these systems contain enough information to characterize reasonably well the cluster mass distribution , this last term is not the main focus of such studies and it can be safely modeled with an approximated convergence plus shear contribution .    in table",

    "as already found in several strong lensing studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the total mass projected within the average distance of the multiple images from the lens center can be measured precisely . in this specific system , we confirm that an increase of the total mass component associated to the two lens galaxies ( i.e. , larger values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) is correlated to a decrease of the total mass contribution related to the cluster ( i.e. , smaller values of @xmath78 ) , and viceversa , in order to keep their sum approximately constant .    then , we repeat two more times the bootstrapping analysis in the 2siss+sie case , first allowing the center of the sie component ( i.e. , the cluster dark - matter halo ) to vary and then including the two candidate ( based on the photometric redshift values ) cluster members nearest in projection to g1 and g2 . in the first case , we obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 km s@xmath3 for the median and 1@xmath60 error values of the sis effective velocity dispersions of the two main lenses , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "compared to the previous estimates ( see the last row in table [ tab4 ] ) , we remark that our assumption on the center of mass of the cluster dark - matter halo does not affect significantly the measurements of the most relevant quantities of our lensing model , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , the estimates of the lens strength of the halo , @xmath42 , change from @xmath81@xmath11 ( in the previous analysis with the total mass center fixed ) to @xmath82@xmath11 ( in this new analysis with the total mass center free ) .",
    "we remind that the squared value of the strength of a lens is proportional to the mass of that lens projected within its einstein radius . from this consideration and from the cited estimates of @xmath42",
    ", we notice that the mass measurements of the cluster dark - matter halo with and without its mass center fixed are consistent , given their uncertainties . in the second case ,",
    "we add two galaxies at a projected distance from g1 of approximately 6@xmath11 ( to the north ) , with luminosity and size values not larger than those of g1 .",
    "we include these two lenses in the model , fixing their total mass center and strength values ( the former to the galaxy luminosity centroids and the latter to the upper limit given by the strength value of g1 ) , and find @xmath1 and @xmath83 km s@xmath3 , respectively , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as from the previous test , comparing these new values with those of table [ tab4 ] , we can exclude a significant effect of the two nearest candidate cluster members on our estimates of the total mass distributions of g1 and g2 .",
    "given their larger projected distances , the possible influence of other cluster members is expected to be even smaller that that of the two neighboring galaxies considered above . from these tests , we can confirm that our measurements of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are robust and that the possible systematic uncertainties , due to our specific modeling assumptions , are approximately on the same order of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "this means that , even considering both statistical and systematic errors , the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be measured with relative errors of less than 10% and , therefore , that the errors on these quantities are not dominating the error budget of the galaxy luminous over total mass fractions presented in sect .",
    "the errors on these last quantities are in fact mainly driven by the errors on the luminous mass values , estimated in the next section from the galaxy spectral energy distribution fitting .",
    "we remark that our estimates of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are consistent , given the errors , with the values of 101 and 236 km s@xmath3 , respectively , obtained by @xcite .",
    "they performed a strong lensing study of this cluster using the multiple images of 13 background sources and modeling the cluster total mass distribution with a combination of an extended nfw profile and several , smaller , truncated isothermal profiles ( representing the candidate cluster member mass contribution ) , scaled according to the faber - jackson relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the adoption of scaling relations to model the total mass distributions of candidate cluster members , necessary in order to reduce the number of parameters of a cluster strong lensing model , provides interesting results on the statistical ensemble of galaxies , but these results should be interpreted very carefully if the main focus is on the study of the mass properties of individual cluster members .",
    "we caution that the choice of particular scaling relations can drive the results on possible variations in the amount of dark matter present in the inner regions of different cluster members . for this reason , tailored strong lensing models ,",
    "like the one presented above , are needed .",
    "furthermore , we measure the stellar velocity dispersion of g2 , @xmath84 , within an aperture with diameter equal to 1.5@xmath11 , from a fit of the vlt / fors2 spectrum shown in figure [ fi10 ] .",
    "we use the pixel - fitting method of @xcite and adopt the template stellar spectra of the miles library ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate a redshift of 0.4402 , consistent with the vimos measurement , and a value of @xmath84 of @xmath85 km s@xmath3 , also consistent , given the uncertainties , with our strong lensing estimate .",
    "we notice that a good agreement between the values of the effective velocity dispersion of an isothermal model and of the central stellar velocity dispersion is common in galaxy - scale strong lensing systems where the multiple image geometry can be reconstructed well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    by exploiting the optimized lens mass models obtained from our bootstrapping analysis",

    "the values of only a few per cent for the magnification relative errors are not surprising , because of the large number of multiple images that provide detailed information about the lens total mass distributions .",
    "we remark that the small errors on the total magnification factors are a minor source of uncertainty on the unlensed luminous mass of the source presented in the next section .",
    "finally , assuming that an isothermal profile is a good description of the total mass distribution of the two lenses out to their effective radius ( for these values in angular units , see @xmath30 in table [ tab1 ] ) and using the results of the bootstrapping analysis ( see table [ tab4 ] ) , we measure total mass values @xmath86 projected within @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( being @xmath89 the value of the gravitational constant ) of @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath5 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",

    "the best - fitting models for the two lens cluster members g1 and g2 are shown in figure [ fi06 ] and for the lensed objects @xmath103 and @xmath104 in figure [ fi08 ] .",
    "we have decided to exclude from the fitting and plots the 4 bluest bands because mostly affected by relevant contamination from very close objects .",
    "we have checked that removing these bands from the sed fitting does not change appreciably the results on the values of the luminous masses .",
    "in fact , photometric mass estimates are known to be more sensitive to the fluxes measured in the redder filters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fitting values of the luminous masses of g1 , g2 , and @xmath99 ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 ) , are , respectively , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 @xmath5 . from the ranges of results obtained by considering the different photometric uncertainties , systematic errors associated to the several possible stellar population modeling assumptions ( i.e. ,",
    "sfh , dust , emission lines ) , and rest - frame wavelength range covered by the hst observations , we estimate relative errors of 40% on @xmath105 and @xmath106 and of 50% on @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , taking into account the value of the average magnification factor of approximately 9 at the positions where @xmath102 and @xmath101 are observed ( see figure [ fi01 ] and table [ tab5 ] ) , we conclude that the measured luminous mass values and errors are @xmath97 for g1 , @xmath98 for g2 , and @xmath100 @xmath5 for @xmath99 .",
    "we remark that to avoid possible artifacts in our following investigation we have explicitly omitted the recent results ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggesting systematic variations in the stellar imf of a galaxy as a function of its luminous mass or stellar velocity dispersion . taking these results into account",

    "first , starting from the total and luminous mass estimates derived in the previous two sections , we measure for g1 and g2 the values of the fraction of luminous over total mass projected inside the effective radius , @xmath126 , in the following way : @xmath127 we obtain @xmath6 and @xmath7 for g1 and g2 , respectively .",
    "then , we consider early - type galaxies with physical properties similar to those of the lenses selected by the slacs survey . for the slacs galaxies , we use the luminous mass estimates by @xcite , that are obtained by fitting the galaxy seds with csp models built on @xcite templates at solar metallicity and with a salpeter stellar imf , and the effective velocity dispersion measurements @xmath122 , presented in @xcite , that are derived by modeling the total mass distribution of the lenses with sie profiles .",
    "several studies have shown that the slacs lens galaxies are an unbiased subsample of the family of sdss massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as far as their luminous and mass properties are concerned .",
    "for this reason , we also use here the results on the luminous over total mass fractions of approximately 2@xmath123 sdss early - type galaxies selected by @xcite . in this last study ,",
    "the values of the galaxy luminous and total mass were measured under the same hypotheses adopted in this work .",
    "we show the results in table [ tab6 ] and figures [ fi03 ] and [ fi04 ] .",
    "looking at table [ tab6 ] and figure [ fi03 ] , we notice that g2 has values of @xmath95 and @xmath122 that are consistent with those of the galaxies in the slacs sample .",
    "interestingly , g1 has values of luminous mass and effective stellar velocity dispersion lower by approximately factors of 30 and 3 , respectively , than the average slacs lens galaxy , but these values are in good agreement with the extrapolation of the scaling relation based on the slacs galaxies only . from the same table and figure [ fi04 ]",
    ", we observe that g2 has a value of luminous over total mass fraction that is typical of sdss massive early - type galaxies .",
    "the value of @xmath126 of g1 instead is smaller , but still consistent with the lower end of the distribution of the sdss sample .",
    "considering the example provided by g1 , we can conclude that in clusters of galaxies it is possible to study galaxy strong lensing on physical scales that are different from ( i.e. , smaller than ) those characterizing isolated early - type galaxies ( e.g. , the slacs lenses ) .",
    "this possibility is offered by the increase with the overdensity of the environment in the probability of one source to be strongly lensed by a ( small ) galaxy",
    ". in different words , the lensing cross section of a single ( small ) galaxy can be significantly enhanced by the presence of the mass distributions primarily on the cluster scale and secondarily on the scale of the neighboring cluster members .",
    "this opens the way to studies on the internal structure of lens galaxies over a more extended range of physical properties than done so far .",
    "we remark that several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have found evidence for the truncation of the total mass profiles of early - type galaxies residing in galaxy clusters .",
    "nonetheless , for a given galaxy , the value of its truncation radius is estimated to be significantly larger that that of its effective radius .",
    "this allows us to disregard , to a first approximation , the possible differences in the values of the stellar over total mass ratios projected within the effective radii of cluster and field early - type galaxies because of their different truncation radii .",
    "moreover , we observe that the results of @xcite and @xcite have shown that the slacs ( i.e. , mainly field ) and coma ( i.e. , cluster ) galaxies , with comparable stellar masses , do not differ appreciably as far as their inner total mass structure and stellar imf are concerned . for these reasons ,",
    "we consider appropriate to plot the values of the central luminous over total mass ratios of cluster and field galaxies in the same plots , as done in figures [ fi03 ] and [ fi04 ] .         following the previous results ,",
    "we expand the intervals of physical scales plotted in figures [ fi03 ] and [ fi04 ] to include a sample of 11 pressure - supported dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) for which all the relevant quantities are available in the literature .",
    "we take the values of effective radius and luminous mass from @xcite and those of stellar velocity dispersion averaged along the line of sight @xmath128 from @xcite .",
    "simplistically , we decide to use the same stellar imf ( i.e. , salpeter ) adopted to estimate the luminous mass of the previous galaxies and the expression given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:04 ] ) to measure the total mass projected within the effective radius .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fi09 ] .",
    "the observed values of luminous mass and velocity dispersion of the dwarf spheroidals do not differ dramatically from the expected values obtained by extrapolating the slacs scaling relation at several orders of magnitude difference .",
    "the projected fractions of luminous over total mass inside the effective radius show instead a clear variation from centrally luminous to dark - matter - dominated systems , moving from massive early - type galaxies to dwarf spheroidals .",
    "we speculate that the similarities and differences between these two classes of astrophysical objects might be explored effectively by extending strong lensing analyses to lenses with diverse physical scales , as started here with g1 .",
    "the clash survey seems to be particularly well suited to this aim , as several other interesting systems of strong lensing on galaxy scale have already been discovered and are currently under investigation .",
    "the combination of unprecedented hst multi - wavelength observations and vlt spectra has allowed us to perform a detailed strong lensing and stellar population analysis of an unusual system composed in total of ten multiple images of a double source , lensed by two early - type galaxies in the field of the clash galaxy cluster macs 1206 .",
    "our main results can be summarized in the following points .",
    "* based on our 16-band photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy , we measure a photometric redshift of 3.7 for the source and spectroscopic redshifts of 0.436 and 0.439 for the two lens galaxies g1 and g2 , respectively , thus confirming their membership to macs 1206 .",
    "* by modeling the total mass distribution of the cluster members and cluster in terms of singular isothermal profiles , we can reconstruct well the observed positions of the multiple images and predict a total magnification factor of approximately 50 for the source .",
    "* from the lensing modeling statistics , we estimate effective velocity dispersion values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 km s@xmath3 , corresponding to total mass values projected within the effective radii of @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xmath5 for g1 and g2 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we obtain reasonable values for the distribution and amount of projected total mass in the galaxy cluster component . * through composite stellar populations synthesis models ( adopting a salpeter stellar imf ) , we infer luminous mass values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath5 for , respectively , g1 and g2 , and @xmath100 @xmath5 for the source , taking into account the estimated lensing magnification factor . * in g1 and g2 , respectively , we derive luminous over total mass fractions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we compare these values with those typical of massive early - type galaxies and dwarf spheroidals and conclude that more analyses in the clash fields of systems similar to that presented here will enable us to extend the investigation of the internal structure of galaxies in an important and still relatively unexplored region of the physical parameter space .",

    "<S> we present a complex strong lensing system in which a double source is imaged five times by two early - type galaxies . we take advantage in this target of the extraordinary multi - band photometric data set obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ) program , complemented by the spectroscopic measurements of the vlt / vimos and fors2 follow - up campaign . </S>",
    "<S> we use a photometric redshift value of 3.7 for the source and confirm spectroscopically the membership of the two lenses to the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2@xmath00847 at redshift 0.44 . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the excellent angular resolution of the hst / acs images to model the two lenses in terms of singular isothermal sphere profiles and derive robust effective velocity dispersion values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 km s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the total mass distribution of the cluster is also well characterized by using only the local information contained in this lensing system , that is located at a projected distance of more than 300 kpc from the cluster luminosity center . according to our best - fitting lensing and composite stellar population models , </S>",
    "<S> the source is magnified by a total factor of 50 and has a luminous mass of approximately @xmath4  @xmath5 ( assuming a salpeter stellar imf ) . by combining the total and luminous mass estimates of the two lenses , we measure luminous over total mass fractions projected within the effective radii of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , with these lenses we can extend the analysis of the mass properties of lens early - type galaxies by factors that are approximately 2 and 3 times smaller than previously done with regard to , respectively , velocity dispersion and luminous mass . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the total and luminous quantities of our lenses with those of astrophysical objects with different physical scales , like massive early - type galaxies and dwarf spheroidals , reveal the potential of studies of this kind for improving our knowledge about the internal structure of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these studies , made possible thanks to the clash survey , will allow us to go beyond the current limits posed by the available lens samples in the field . </S>"
