    "the cern heavy - ion program and the forthcoming start of the bnl - rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) make the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase of hot qcd of great current interest [ 1 ] .",
    "the screening length and the potential between quarks in a qgp , and the dispersion relations of the self - energy of gluon are important topics for the study of the qgp phase in a hot qcd .",
    "quantum field theory at finite temperature and density is a powerful tool for the study of these subjects .",
    "there are three different approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature and density .",
    "it is mainly the following : the older euclidean imaginary - time matsubara formalism [ 2 ] , the closed time - path method due to schwinger and keldysh [ 3 ] , and the real time operator - based finite temperature field theory , thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) due to takahashi and umezawa [ 4 ] .",
    "the central idea of tfd is the thermal vacuum and the doubling of the hilbert space of states .",
    "it permits thermal averages , which are traces over fock space , to be written as expectation values with respect to the thermal vacuum .",
    "the operators in this doubled space are effectively doubled in number as well . within tfd , the quantum field theory is naturally extended to finite temperature without having to consider imaginary time .",
    "tfd is more concise and an easy and convenient way to study the above subjects .",
    "the studies reported in this paper are based on tfd .",
    "its purpose is three - fold : ( 1 ) within this framework we calculate perturbatively the screening length in the qgp at one - loop level ; ( 2 ) the dispersion relations of self energy of gluon are derived and , ( 3 ) the potential between a quark and an antiquark in a hot qcd is obtained up to @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the qcd coupling constant . as a simple example the potential between electron and positron in a hot qed is derived .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the screening length in a hot qcd is obtained in one - loop level in tfd approach , and we discuss both the color - electric and the color - magnetic sectors . in sec .",
    "iii , the dispersion relations of the gluon self energy at finite temperature are proved and explain the physical results on the real part and imaginary part of the gluon self energy . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the screened coulomb potential in a hot qed up to all orders and the potential between a quark and an antiquark in a hot qcd up to @xmath4 . finally , in sec .",
    "v some conclusions and comments are presented .",
