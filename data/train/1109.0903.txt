    "in this paper we establish the following main result .",
    "the terminology , the context , the relevance , and a conceptual outline of the methods underlying the proof are explained in the next few pages :    [ main : intro : teo ] consider the link shown in fig .",
    "[ chain5_fig : fig ] , fix a cyclic ordering on its components and employ the meridian - longitude homology bases to parameterize the dehn surgeries on the link",
    ". then a dehn surgery is exceptional if and only if up to a composition of the following maps @xmath4 it contains one of the next two or it is one of the subsequent five : @xmath5 moreover , no two of these seven fillings are related to each other by any composition of the above five maps .    * * dehn surgery and dehn filling**the operation of _ dehn surgery _ on a link in the @xmath0-sphere , and its natural generalization , termed _ dehn filling _ , are fundamental ones in @xmath0-dimensional geometric topology .",
    "the input of an operation of dehn filling is given by    * a compact 3-manifold @xmath6 ( that we will always tacitly assume to be orientable and connected ) with boundary @xmath7 consisting of tori , and * a _ slope _",
    "( namely , the isotopy class of a nontrivial simple closed unoriented curve ) on each component of @xmath7 .",
    "the result of the operation is the manifold obtained by attaching to @xmath6 a copy of the solid torus @xmath8 along each component of @xmath7 , with a solid torus attached to a component @xmath9 of @xmath7 so that the meridian @xmath10 is matched to the slope @xmath11 contained in @xmath9 . to allow @xmath9 to be left unfilled",
    ", one also allows @xmath11 to be the empty slope .",
    "a dehn surgery on a link @xmath12 in the @xmath0-sphere is a dehn filling on its exterior ( the complement of an open regular neighbourhood ) . to highlight the importance of this operation we recall for instance the celebrated theorem of lickorish  @xcite , according to which",
    "every closed ( orientable ) @xmath0-manifold is the result of a dehn surgery on some link in @xmath13 .",
    "_ in the rest of this paper , when a manifold @xmath6 bounded by tori is given , by a _ ( dehn )",
    "filling _ on @xmath6 we will mostly refer to the set of slopes along which the filling has to be performed .",
    "occasionally we will also use the same term to refer to the manifold resulting from the operation of filling along the given slopes , but when there is any risk of confusion we will distinguish between the filling ( viewed as an instruction ) and its result .",
    "_    * * hyperbolic manifolds and exceptional fillings**we say that @xmath6 is _ hyperbolic _",
    "@xcite if its interior admits a complete hyperbolic metric with finite volume , in which case the components of @xmath7 correspond to the _ cusps _ of the interior of @xmath6 .",
    "the famous _ hyperbolic dehn filling theorem _ of thurston  @xcite states that if @xmath6 is hyperbolic then `` most '' dehn fillings on @xmath6 give manifolds that are also hyperbolic . a dehn filling not producing a hyperbolic manifold is called _ exceptional_. we continue here the program initiated in  @xcite of classifying the exceptional fillings on hyperbolic manifolds with an increasing number of boundary components . namely , we provide a complete classification of all the exceptional fillings on the exterior @xmath1 of the _ minimally twisted chain link _ with 5 components in the @xmath0-sphere , shown in fig .",
    "[ chain5_fig : fig ] and denoted by l10n113 in thistlewaite s tables .",
    "the relevance of the 5-cusped hyperbolic manifold @xmath1 comes from the following facts .",
    "first , it is conjecturally  @xcite the 5-cusped manifold with smallest volume @xmath14 and smallest matveev complexity @xmath15 ( it can be triangulated using 10 regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra , see below ) .",
    "second , by filling @xmath1 one obtains a multitude of interesting manifolds , including most manifolds from the cusped census  @xcite , and many one - cusped manifolds having interesting exceptional fillings , such as various families of berge  @xcite knot exteriors , all eudave - muoz  @xcite knot exteriors , and all exceptional reducible - toroidal pairs at maximal distance  @xcite .",
    "third , the manifold @xmath1 has a nice and unusually large symmetry group , because it double covers a very natural and symmetric orbifold , called the _",
    ", with underlying space @xmath13 viewed as the boundary of the 4-simplex and as singular set the 1-skeleton of the 4-simplex .",
    "the exceptional fillings on @xmath1 are classified by theorem  [ main : intro : teo ] .",
    "our proof of this result was computer - assisted but rigorous , namely immune from drawbacks coming from numerical approximation .",
    "we wrote a python code that uses the _ snappy _ libraries  @xcite , takes as an input any hyperbolic manifold @xmath6 ( with an arbitrary number of cusps ) , and gives as an output a list of candidate exceptional fillings on @xmath6 , including all truly exceptional ones .",
    "the fact that indeed all truly exceptional fillings are included follows from the use of moser s template  @xcite , that allows one to make snappy s numerical calculations rigorous . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the list of candidate exceptional fillings actually turned out to be extremely small up to the action of some symmetry groups , and the conclusion of the proof of theorem  [ main : intro : teo ] was then obtained by explicitly recognizing the manifolds resulting from the candidate exceptional fillings , thus proving them not to be hyperbolic ; this process was carried out both by hand and using the matveev - tarkaev  @xcite nice _",
    "recognizer _ program .",
    "we point out that our python code find_exceptional_fillings.py is publicly available from  @xcite and can be used on any hyperbolic manifold .",
    "we have tested the code on various manifolds and found that the output list of candidate exceptional fillings is typically correct ( _ i.e. _ ,  all the fillings in the list are indeed exceptional ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main : intro : teo ] contained in section  [ proof : section ] below may be viewed as a tutorial introduction to the code .",
    "one of the key features of theorem  [ main : intro : teo ] is in our opinion the unexpected shortness of its statement .",
    "in fact , our results show that very little information is needed to list all the exceptional fillings on @xmath1 , and also to give a very precise description of all the corresponding filled manifolds .",
    "this is due to the many symmetries possessed by @xmath1 and by some hyperbolic manifolds obtained as dehn fillings of @xmath1 . in fact",
    ", theorem  [ main : intro : teo ] shows that _ only @xmath16 exceptional fillings on @xmath1 are responsible for all the other ones _ and the geometric meaning of the maps appearing in the statement will be made more precise soon .",
    "in addition , _ a single _ exceptional filling on @xmath1 the first one listed in theorem  [ main : intro : teo] is responsible for the vast majority of the other ones : the remaining @xmath17 exceptional fillings can be viewed as being very sporadic . since most of the manifolds in the callahan - hildebrand - weeks cusped census  @xcite can be obtained as fillings of @xmath1 , we can conclude that most of the exceptional fillings on the manifolds in the census are determined by this single exceptional filling on @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , all the 10 exceptional surgeries on the figure-8 knot are consequences of it .    * * a notable finite ( ? ) sequence of cusped hyperbolic manifolds**figure  [ sequence : fig ] shows five links in the @xmath0-sphere , at least the first three of which are famous ones : the _ figure - eight knot _ k4a1@xmath18 , the _ whitehead link _ l5a1=@xmath19 , and the _ chain link _ with 3 components l6a5@xmath20 ; we then have the chain l8n7@xmath21 link with 4 components , and ( of course ) the minimally twisted @xmath22-chain link l10n113 ( for the first four links we are indicating both thistlewaite s and rolfsen s names ) .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath23 the exterior of the @xmath24-th link in fig .",
    "[ sequence : fig ] ( the notation is consistent for @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is well - known that each @xmath23 is an @xmath24-cusped hyperbolic manifold , and the finite sequence @xmath25 has several interesting features .",
    "we first note that @xmath23 is a filling of @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "we then recall that each @xmath23 is conjectured  @xcite to have the smallest volume among @xmath24-cusped hyperbolic manifolds ; the conjecture was proved in  @xcite for @xmath28 and in  @xcite for @xmath29 , and it is open for @xmath30 .",
    "but the most remarkable properties of @xmath25 arise when one considers their exceptional fillings .",
    "the manifold @xmath31 was already called the _ magic _ one in  @xcite , because it has many notable exceptional fillings .",
    "the exceptional fillings on @xmath32 were classified by thurston  @xcite , those on @xmath33 and @xmath31 were classified by martelli and petronio  @xcite , and those on @xmath34 and @xmath1 are classified here .",
    "our next aim is to explain our discovery that _ the amount of information required to describe the exceptional fillings on @xmath23 is roughly constant for @xmath35 . _ considering that the number of cusps and the volume of @xmath23 increase with @xmath24 , we believe that this is a rather remarkable fact . however , to substantiate our statement we need to be a little more specific . in fact , as soon as a hyperbolic manifold @xmath6 has more than one cusp , infinitely many fillings on @xmath6 are typically exceptional , but finitely many fillings are responsible for all other ones . to make this explicit",
    ", we define an exceptional filling on @xmath6 to be _ isolated _ if all its proper sub - fillings ( namely , those obtained by replacing at least one non - empty slope with an empty one ) are hyperbolic . a filling having an exceptional proper",
    "sub - filling is exceptional unless a very special situation occurs , which is never the case for our @xmath23 s .",
    "we can then conclude that _ a filling on @xmath23 is exceptional if and only if it contains an exceptional filling_.    getting to the actual data we have obtained , we start by listing in table  [ exceptional_1:table ] the numbers of isolated exceptional fillings on @xmath23 for @xmath35 , split according to the number @xmath36 of cusps filled .",
