    "the pion _ electromagnetic _ form factor is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electromagnetic current , @xmath17 .",
    "the form factor is normalized as @xmath18 .    as function of the complex variable @xmath19 ,",
    "the form factor @xmath20 has a cut in the complex @xmath21-plane starting at the two - pion threshold @xmath22 which corresponds to two - pion intermediate states .",
    "there are also cuts related to @xmath23 intermediate states and multimeson states ( @xmath24 , etc ) .",
    "the form factor in the timelike region @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the phase . for the theoretical description of the form factor in different regions of momentum transfers",
    "different theoretical approaches are used .    at large spacelike momentum transfers ,",
    "@xmath28 , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) gives rigorous predictions for the asymptotic behaviour of the form factor @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the qcd coupling parameter and @xmath31 mev is the pion decay constant defined by the relation @xmath32 as the spacelike momentum transfer becomes smaller , the form factor turns out to be the result of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects , with a strong evidence that nonperturbative qcd effects dominate in the region @xmath33 gev@xmath11 @xcite . the picture based on the concept of constituent quarks which effectively account for nonperturbative dynamics",
    "has proven to be efficient for the description of the form factor in this region ( see for instance @xcite ) .    at large timelike momentum transfers , @xmath34 gev@xmath11 , @xmath20 can be obtained from the analytic continuation of the pqcd formula ( [ pqcd ] ) . at",
    "small timelike momentum transfers the situation is more complicated since there dynamical details of the confinement mechanism are crucial .",
    "quarks and gluons are no longer the degrees of freedom of qcd leading to a simple description of the form factor . at timelike momentum transfers we are",
    "essentially in the region of hadronic singularities and typically one relies on methods based on hadronic degrees of freedom . in the region of interest to us here , @xmath35 gev@xmath11 , the lightest pseudoscalar mesons are most important .",
    "there are many approaches to understand the behaviour of the pion form factor at timelike momentum transfers from 0 to 1.5 gev@xmath11 .",
    "a time honoured approach is based on the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model @xcite . in the simplest version of vmd",
    "one assumes just the @xmath4-meson dominance , which leads to @xmath36 this simple formula works with a good accuracy both for small spacelike momentum transfers and timelike momentum transfers below the @xmath37 threshold : @xmath38 gev@xmath39 . for @xmath21 near the @xmath37 threshold one should take into account effects of the virtual pions . in this region momenta of the intermediate pions are small and a consistent description of the form factor is provided by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , the effective theory for qcd at low energies .    for higher @xmath21 , in the region of @xmath4 and @xmath14 resonances , a similar rigorous treatment of the form factor is still lacking , and one has to rely on model considerations .",
    "contributions of the two - pion intermediate states may be consistently described by dispersion representations .",
    "the application of dispersion relations has led to the famous gounaris - sakurai ( gs ) formula @xcite which takes into account @xmath4-meson finite width corrections due to the virtual pions @xmath40 the function @xmath41 corresponds to the two - pion loop diagram .",
    "the corresponding feynman integral is linearly divergent , but its imaginary part is defined in a unique way . the real part is then reconstructed by a doubly - subtracted dispersion representation . the gounaris - sakurai prescription to fix the subtraction constants reads @xmath42 the phase of the form factor @xmath43 for the gs prescription agrees well with the experimental data in the region @xmath44 gev@xmath11 . but ( [ piff_b ] ) gives too small a value ( by @xmath45 ) for @xmath46 at @xmath21 around @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , one can consider a simple vmd ansatz taking only the @xmath4-meson contribution into account .",
    "this should be a good approximation in the region @xmath48 gev@xmath11 , except for the narrow interval near @xmath49 where the @xmath7 mixing effects are important @xcite .",
    "the simple vmd ansatz is then very similar to ( [ piff_b ] ) , but with the numerator replaced by the @xmath50 transition matrix element : @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined according to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath4-meson polarization and @xmath56 is the 4-momentum vector .",
    "now @xmath46 from ( [ piff_c ] ) describes well the data for @xmath57 . but extrapolating the eq .",
    "( [ piff_c ] ) to @xmath58 gives @xmath59 in gross violation of the normalization condition @xmath18 .",
    "thus , neither ( [ piff_b ] ) nor ( [ piff_c ] ) can describe the form factor for all @xmath60 gev@xmath11 : namely , ( [ piff_b ] ) leads to a too small value of @xmath61 at @xmath62 , whereas the form factor given by ( [ piff_c ] ) is far above unity at @xmath58 .",
    "there were many attempts to modify the vector meson dominance or to use related approaches in order to bring the results on the pion form factor in agreement with the data ( see @xcite and papers quoted therein ) .",
    "the pion form factor in the region @xmath60 gev@xmath11 is one of the main sources for obtaining masses and coupling constants of vector mesons .",
    "however , with different assumptions on the form of the vector - resonance contribution to the pion form factor one obtains different values of masses and couplings .",
    "therefore a consistent description of the pion form factor in this region in terms of the low - lying mesons ( @xmath63 ) is crucial for extracting reliable values of these parameters .",
    "interesting results have been obtained by the authors of @xcite who noticed that an effective momentum - dependent @xmath2 coupling appears in the framework of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "this momentum - dependent @xmath2 coupling considerably improves the description of the pion form factor at timelike momentum transfers in the region @xmath64 gev@xmath11 .",
    "our analysis is similar in spirit to the approach of @xcite .",
    "the goal of our paper is twofold : first , to analyse the pion form factor in a dispersion approach and to establish in this way a general form of the resonance contribution to the form factor , paying special attention to the analysis of the existing ambiguities .",
    "second , to apply the results obtained to the extraction of the @xmath4 and @xmath14 masses and couplings from the pion form factor data .",
    "we make use of a dispersion approach to the pion form factor in a model with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath65 , and gauge - invariant @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath7 couplings .",
    "our approach allows an exact resummation of pion and kaon loops .",
    "we pay a special attention to the analysis of ambiguities related to subtractions in linearly divergent meson loop diagrams and show that they may be reabsorbed in the physical masses and the effective couplings in the expression for the pion form factor . after taking into account the @xmath7 mixing effects the pion form factor in the range @xmath68 gev@xmath11",
    "is well described both in magnitude and phase by a formula which is similar to the vmd expressions ( [ piff_b ] ) and ( [ piff_c ] ) but avoids their pitfalls .",
    "our model makes use of conventional methods of dispersion theory .",
    "first we make an ansatz for the effective couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons and the photon .",
    "these couplings are used in essence only to calculate the absorptive parts of the amplitudes .",
    "the complete amplitudes are then obtained by dispersion relations and a dyson resummation .",
    "we want to make clear from the outset that our effective couplings discussed below are not to be compared directly to the effective lagrangian of chpt @xcite and resonance theory in the framework of chpt @xcite .",
    "we shall see , however , that our model , used as explained above , respects all the known results from chpt for the pion form factor .",
    "thus our model can be seen as an alternative to the one of @xcite where chpt results are extended to @xmath20 in the range @xmath69 gev@xmath11 using again a resummation scheme .    in our model pions",
    "interact with the @xmath4-mesons and generate in this way the finite @xmath4 meson width .",
    "are essentially saturated by the meson resonance exchange . ]",
    "the @xmath13-meson is coupled to the conserved vector current of charged pions as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the conserved vector field describing the @xmath4 meson .",
    "we denote in this section @xmath72 . matching to the one - loop chpt",
    "@xcite leads to the relation @xmath73 the photon is coupled to the charged pion through the usual minimal coupling , @xmath74 we also add a direct gauge - invariant @xmath75 coupling of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 this model is similar to the model of @xcite .",
    "no @xmath78-parity violating @xmath65 or direct @xmath79 couplings are included at this stage .",
    "c    as explained above , we calculate the electromagnetic form factor in our model by the sum of the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figure-1:piff ] . summing all the pion loop insertions",
    ", we obtain @xmath80 the quantites @xmath41 and @xmath81 correspond to one - loop @xmath2 and @xmath82 self energy diagrams generated by the pion loop .",
    "the imaginary parts of these diagrams can be calculated by setting the intermediate pions on mass shell .",
    "the full functions @xmath41 and @xmath81 are constructed from their imaginary parts by means of the spectral representation with a suitable number of subtractions and by adding the corresponding subtraction constants . for the @xmath37 intermediate states the imaginary parts of the functions @xmath41 and @xmath81 satisfy the relations @xmath83 where @xmath84 for the realistic description we have to take into account also contributions of @xmath85 and @xmath86 intermediate states . the coupling constant @xmath87 can not be measured directly .",
    "we use the relation @xmath88 which is valid in the su(3 ) limit . repeating the procedure described above , summing the pion and kaon loops we find with ( [ gsu3 ] ) @xmath89 and",
    "hence @xmath90 it follows from ( [ rel1 ] ) that the difference @xmath91 is a polynomial in @xmath21 determined by the subtraction conditions .",
    "hence the numerator of the pion form factor ( [ fff ] ) is also a real polynomial .",
    "therefore , the phase of the form factor is completely determined by the denominator .",
    "the latter is the usual propagator of the @xmath4 meson with the finite width corrections taken into account .",
    "let us now consider subtraction constants .",
    "the function @xmath81 describes the coupling of the pion to the conserved electromagnetic current .",
    "therefore we must set @xmath92 such that the charge of the pion remains unrenormalized by higher order corrections .",
    "the function @xmath41 determines the behaviour of the @xmath37 elastic @xmath93 partial wave amplitude in which the @xmath4-meson pole is known to be present in the zero - width limit .",
    "therefore , we require meson mass . notice that various definitions of the mass and the width of a resonance are used in the literature .",
    "for a different definition see e.g. @xcite ] @xmath94 let us point out that this is essentially our definition of the @xmath4 meson mass .",
    "one should take into account that various definitions of the mass and the width of a resonance    of nonzero width    without a loss of generality the second subtraction constant may be fixed by setting @xmath95 any other condition would just lead to rescaling of the parameters in the formula for the form factor .",
    "thus , in a model we are considering when pions interact via a single @xmath4-meson exchange the general expression for the form factor incorporating subtraction ambiguities in the @xmath37 and @xmath96 loop diagrams contains three constants @xmath47 , @xmath97 , and @xmath53 @xmath98 here    @xmath99    @xmath100 is defined by ( [ is ] ) , and @xmath101 where v.p . means the principle value .",
    "let us point out that the numerator of the form factor in ( [ rhodominance ] ) is not a constant , but a linear function of @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath21-dependence appears as the direct consequence of the current conservation .",
    "( [ rhodominance ] ) can be written in the form of the modified gs formula meson mass , whereas eq .",
    "( 5.23 ) contains both bare and physical masses . ] @xmath102 with the effective @xmath21-dependent @xmath103 coupling constant @xmath104 two remarks are in order here : first , one should be careful with the interpretation of this result : as is clear from ( [ bgammarho ] ) , there is no direct transition of the @xmath4 meson to the _ real _ photon as a consequence of the gauge invariant @xmath66 coupling @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ effective _ coupling @xmath105 is clearly nonzero at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the pion form factor _ looks _ as the direct @xmath66 coupling also for the real photon .",
    "this is just the usual vector meson dominance .",
    "the latter thus emerges as the direct consequence of our assumption that the vector meson couples to the same pion current as the photon . for further discussions of the relationship between vmd and gauge invariance we refer to @xcite .",
    "if we use the chpt relation ( [ chpt ] ) , which agrees perfectly with the measured value of @xmath106 , then ( [ frhoeff ] ) leads to an interesting relation @xmath107 note that the phase of @xmath20 in ( [ piff_our ] ) is still given by eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) and is completely determined by the function @xmath41 .",
    "second , it should be noted that the @xmath4-meson contribution to the pion form factor given by ( [ piff_our ] ) does not fall down sufficienty fast in the limit @xmath108 .",
    "thus , for a realistic description of the pion form factor in a broader range of timelike momentum transfers , coupling of pions to higher vector resonances @xmath109 etc should be added . however ,",
    "if a vector - meson coupling to the photon is described by the gauge - invariant expression ( [ rhogamma ] ) , contributions of higher resonances to @xmath61 are negligible in the region @xmath110 gev@xmath11 ( see recent analyses @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested only in this region and therefore do not take higher resonances @xmath109 etc into consideration .",
    "in section [ section:2 ] we discussed the @xmath4 contribution to the pion form factor ( the bare @xmath4 plus the effects of the @xmath4-meson width due to the light - meson loops ) .",
    "this analysis is sufficient for describing the pion form factor of the charged vector current using the cvc relation . for the electromagnetic pion form factor",
    "it is necessary to take into account the @xmath7 mixing effects .",
    "the @xmath14 is coupled to the pions and the photon similarly to the @xmath13-meson [ cf .",
    "( [ rhopipi ] ) and ( [ rhogamma ] ) ] @xmath112 @xmath113 being a conserved vector field describing the @xmath14-meson and @xmath114 .",
    "it has proven useful to classify various contributions to hadronic amplitudes according to their formal order in the @xmath115 expansion @xcite , where @xmath116=3 is the number of colours in qcd . in the language of the @xmath115 expansion the analysis of the previous section corresponds to taking into account the leading order @xmath115 process ( resonance in a zero - width approximation ) and the subleading @xmath117 effects of the meson loops . and of order @xmath118 of the momentum expansion . ] performing a resummation of these meson loops gave our dispersion description of the form factor .",
    "a corresponding treatment of the @xmath7 mixing effects then requires taking into account the leading and subleading @xmath115 effects as well . to leading order in @xmath119",
    ", meson loops do not contribute and therefore the only effect is the direct @xmath7 transition described in terms of the direct coupling ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    at subleading @xmath115 order several meson loop diagrams shown in fig . 2 emerge .",
    "we make use of spectral representations for loop diagrams , i.e. we calculate directly the imaginary parts and then reconstruct the full function by means of the spectral integral with a relevant number of subtractions .",
    "subtraction constants are then either fixed by physical constraints or determined by the experimental data .",
    "let us point out an important feature related to our dispersion calculation : the direct @xmath7 coupling ( a leading @xmath115 process ) and the _ real part _ of the @xmath7 mixing loop diagrams at @xmath120 ( a subleading @xmath115 process ) contribute to the form factor precisely the same way , such that only their sum has a physical meaning .",
    "we therefore account for the net effect of these two contributions by a single subtraction constant and do not consider the direct @xmath7 coupling separately .",
    "we have analysed in section [ section:2 ] the @xmath4-meson self - energy function @xmath121 which determines the propagator of the interacting @xmath4 meson .",
    "let us now discuss a similar self - energy function of the @xmath14-meson @xmath122 and the off - diagonal @xmath7 function @xmath123 which describes the @xmath7 mixing .",
    "the function @xmath122 determines the @xmath14-propagator @xmath124 in the absence of the @xmath7 mixing effects . the main contribution to @xmath125",
    "is given by the three - pion intermediate states .",
    "this @xmath125 should then be inserted into a dispersion integral to get @xmath122 . however , because of the small width of the @xmath14-resonance , it is sufficient for our analysis to consider as a simple ansatz a constant @xmath122 @xmath126 possible processes which contribute to the @xmath7 mixing amplitude @xmath127 are shown in fig .
