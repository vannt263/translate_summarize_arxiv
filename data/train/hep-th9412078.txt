    "we now summarise the results of this paper .",
    "the key result of the paper is the formulation of a fuchsian uniformisation related to the teichmller spaces of hitchin .",
    "other results are : a direct relationship to w - gravity is presented by relating the beltrami differential s of the uniformisation to the beltrami differentials of w - gravity ( in sec .",
    "4 ) and thus recovering w - diffeomorphisms from a subgroup of diffeomorphisms on the higher dimensional manifold .",
    "this proves that the manifolds obtained from uniformisation can be considered as w - space .",
    "we also discuss how higher dimensional generalisations of the schwarzian , which we construct play the role of projective connections on the higher dimensional manifold .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we discuss the basics of linear differential equations and introduce halphen invariants which are generalisations of the schwarzian .",
    "we then discuss the conditions under which a deformation of a linear differential equation is isomonodromic .",
    "this section is mainly a collection of well known results and are included for completeness and to fix the notation . in section 3 , we formulate the uniformisation problem and construct @xmath1-space . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss how deformations of complex structure in @xmath1-space project to give the standard beltrami equations on the @xmath1-surface .",
    "we also show how deformations of complex structure can be parametrised by higher symmetric differentials . in section 5",
    ", we briefly discuss the projective structures on @xmath1-manifolds and present higher dimensional generalisations of the schwarzian . in section 6 , we end with some conclusions and suggestions .",
    "the relationship of linear differential equations to @xmath1-algebras is quite well known .",
    "we refer the reader to the work of drinfeld and sokolov@xcite and di francesco _",

    "( this implies that the @xmath37 have at most poles of order @xmath38 at the singular points and are analytic elsewhere . ) in this paper , we shall be restrict ourselves to the case of no singularities .",
    "however , we shall be solving these differential equations on riemann surfaces of genus larger than one and thus the non - triviality comes from the non - trivialness of its fundamental group .",
    "singularities correspond to punctures ( on the riemann surface ) and we shall not discuss them here . by means of the following redefinition @xmath39 , the differential equation can always be converted to one of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath42 implies that the wronskian is a constant ( chosen to be equal to @xmath43 with no loss of generality ) . for this to be consistent globally on the riemann surface , the wronskian has to transform like a scalar . a simple calculation ( see appendix [ wronk ] ) shows that this implies that @xmath44 is a @xmath45  differential .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , this differential equation has an important role in the uniformisation of riemann surfaces .",

    "this change of variables is linear when @xmath54 and uniquely fixed by the tensor weight of @xmath52 and the linear dependence on @xmath48@xcite .",
    "when @xmath54 , one can explicitly write out the expression for @xmath52 in terms of @xmath48 and its derivatives .",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above expressions are the same for all @xmath20 .",
    "this explains the unusual choice normalisations in ( [ eodeb ] ) .",

    "the residual transformations which preserve the laguerre - forsyth form are the mbius transformations .    when all @xmath60 for @xmath53 , all solutions of ( [ eodeb ] ) can be generated from the two solutions @xmath61 of the auxiliary differential equation ( [ eaux ] ) .",

    "this is reflected by the fact that the beltrami differentials corresponding to @xmath195 are not directly the beltrami differentials in the usual formulation of @xmath1-gravity .",
    "nevertheless , we claim that there exists an invertible transformation ( possibly non - linear ) relating the two sets of beltrami differentials .",

    "it is therefore useful to work out an algorithm to generate this transformation .",
    "we hope to address this issue in the future@xcite .",
    "the beltrami differentials which parametrise the deformation of complex structure can be constructed using quadratic , cubic and higher order symmetric differentials@xcite .",
    "thus , if we identify the space of complex structures as being locally parametrised by these differentials , we immediately recover the result that the dimension of this space is given by dim(psl(@xmath209 .",
    "this space can be identified with the teichmuller component of hitchin labelled @xmath18 .",
    "this follows by using the result that the fuchsian group gets deformed by the beltrami differentials and the space of fuchsian groups which uniformise is the teichmller component @xmath18 .",
    "it has been known for a while now that the generators of @xmath1-algebras behave as generalised projective connections . however , the exact sense in which this occurs was not clear .",
    "the differential equation constructed using the projective connections did give maps into @xmath4 , but the fact that the map is from a one dimensional space to a @xmath2 dimensional space did not let one use the standard definition of projective structures except when @xmath46 .",
    "however , we have now been able to extend the base space to an @xmath2 dimensional space and now the standard definition can be applied .    a projective structure",
    "can now be defined as maps from charts on @xmath29 to @xmath4 with transition functions at the overlap of charts belonging to @xmath3 .",
    "note that the most general transition function would belong to @xmath21 but we are interested in real projective structures or to be precise , @xmath4 structures with real holonomy .",
    "this imposes the reality condition on the transition functions .",
    "given a patch definition of the projective structure , one can easily obtain the corresponding projective connections either by using the wronskian method ( if the projective structure is described in terms of homogeneous coordinates ) or the halphen invariants ( if the projective structure is defined in terms of inhomogeneous coordinates ) .    the converse is a little bit more involved . given the projective connections @xmath48 , one would like to find the projective coordinates .",
    "first , one has to extend the @xmath48 as functions of the kdv times such that they solve the relevant equations of the generalised kdv hierarchy .",
    "then the solutions of the equations ( [ eodeb ] ) and ( [ eexta ] ) furnish the projective coordinates @xmath99 .",
    "note that one has implicitly extended to the riemann surface to the trivial @xmath1-manifold .",
    "the halphen invariants @xmath78 can be also be rewritten in terms of the extended variables .",
    "for example , for the case @xmath69 we obtain @xmath210 in this higher dimensional setting , the halphen invariants now are the right generalisations of the schwarzian .",
    "unlike the situation in section 2 , now the symmetry between the inhomogenous coordinates and the independent variables ( @xmath211 ) has been restored in the @xmath78 . in the form",
    "given above , gomis _ et al .",
    "_ refer to these as @xmath1-schwarzians but we shall continue to call them halphen invariants .",
    "it is actually simpler to use the equations ( [ eexta ] ) to obtain the extended halphen invariants by substituting @xmath212 for @xmath44 and solving for @xmath48 .",
    "the halphen invariants continue to be invariant under projective transformations even after they are extended by the kdv times .",
    "further , they vanish when the coordinates @xmath153 are chosen such that @xmath73 are related to the @xmath153 as in the trivial @xmath1-manifold . in this coordinate system ,",
    "@xmath155 and by recursively using the general structure of equations in ( [ eexta ] ) , one can see that @xmath66 . for the @xmath46 case",
    ", @xmath54 corresponded to choosing the uniformising coordinate ( on the upper half plane ) .",
    "similarly , here such a coordinate can be thought of as choosing the uniformising coordinates .",
    "deformations of projective structure are obtained by deforming the halphen invariants by symmetric differentials .",
    "hence the space of projective structures can be identified by the space of symmetric differentials just as in the case of @xmath46 , a deformation of a projective structure could be described by a quadratic differential .",
    "this can be made more precise by using the correspondence with higgs bundle description of teichmller space@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed @xmath1-space using the generalised kdv times as @xmath30-coordinates .",
    "this provides the geometry behind @xmath1-gravity and also gives geometrical insight into the teichmller components of hitchin .",
    "the new set of complex manifolds @xmath29 that we have introduced may be interesting in their own right",
    ". it would be interesting to obtain more information about them .",
    "we believe that they must be kahler manifolds like the original manifold @xmath7 . what is the metric on this space ?",
    "it is also of interest to understand the mapping class group ( equivalent to understanding `` large '' @xmath1-diffeomorphisms ) so that we can construct the moduli spaces for @xmath1-gravity .",
    "this will be of some significance for @xmath1-strings .",
    "since the moduli of these spaces correspond to variation of hodge structures@xcite , there must exist a description of these structures directly in the higher dimension .",
    "this can be done via higgs bundles in higher dimensions which has been studied by simpson@xcite . assuming this is possible",
    ", this would imply that the differential equation ( [ eodeb ] ) and the equations ( [ eexta ] ) can be rewritten as self - duality equations in the higher dimensional space .",
    "the proposal in @xcite of the flat connections as generalised vielbeins and spin - connections can probably be made more concrete .",
    "this would lead to a covariant description of @xmath1-gravity .",
    "we hope to discuss this issue in the future .",
    "one of the important issues is to understand how to couple matter to @xmath1-gravity directly in this higher dimensional setting . since objects in this higher dimensional space project down to terms involving higher derivatives , it is obvious that extrinsic geometry has to play a role .",
    "an interesting example has been furnished by the case of a massless rigid particle whose action is given only by the extrinsic curvature term .",
    "it has been shown recently that this theory has @xmath5 symmetry@xcite .",
    "there must exist stringy generalisations of this with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this could possibly be related to the qcd string or even new fundamental string theories .",
    "this work has dealt with the case of riemann surfaces with genus @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to include the cases of the sphere with @xmath213 punctures and the torus with @xmath214 punctures since they also admit fuchsian uniformisation . in the differential equation approach studied in this paper , punctures correspond to regular singular points of the differential equation such that the monodromy around the puncture belong to a specific conjugacy class .",
    "it is useful to work out this case since one can be a lot more explicit and this can provide us with a better understanding of the @xmath30-moduli .",
    "finally , even though we have restricted our discussion to the case of @xmath0-gravity , the generalisation to include the case of other simple lie groups is straight forward .",
    "this should cover the class of @xmath1-gravities which are called `` generic '' .",
    "it is not clear to us how the `` exotic '' algebras fit into this construction .",
    "* appendix *",
    "we discuss some elementary facts about linear differential equations .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath104 be a set of linearly independent solutions of a @xmath20-th order homogeneous linear differential equation of the form ( [ eodea ] ) .",
    "given @xmath36 , one can reconstruct the differential equation ( [ eodea ] ) .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "define the _ wronskian _ as follows @xmath215 we shall refer to the wronskian by @xmath216 $ ] or just @xmath1 when its arguments are obvious .",
    "further , define @xmath217 \\{@xmath1 with the @xmath38-th row replaced by @xmath218}. then , @xmath36 solve equation ( [ eodea ] ) with @xmath219 .",
    "the proof of this is simple .",
    "the linear independence of the solutions implies that any other solution @xmath44 will be a linear combination of the @xmath36 . this can be expressed in the following form from which the differential equation for @xmath44 is obtained .",
    "@xmath220 comparing equation ( [ eodeaa ] ) with ( [ eodea ] ) , we obtain @xmath219 .",
    "one can check that under the substitution @xmath221 , the wronskian satisfies the following property @xmath222 = \\lambda^n w[s_{i}]\\quad { \\rm for } \\quad i=1,\\ldots , n\\quad ,    \\label{ewprop}\\ ] ] for any function @xmath223",
    ".    one can easily see that @xmath224 , which implies that @xmath225 .",
    "so if @xmath226 ( as in equation ( [ eodeb ] ) ) , then it follows that @xmath227 which implies that @xmath1 is independent of @xmath49 . from the definition of the wronskian it follows that @xmath228 if @xmath229 . here",
    "@xmath230 is the canonical holomorphic line bundle on a riemann surface with coordinate @xmath49 . for the condition",
    "@xmath231 constant to make sense globally , we require that @xmath1 be a scalar ( @xmath232 ) which implies that @xmath233 .",
