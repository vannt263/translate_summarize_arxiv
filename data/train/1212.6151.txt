    "_ a finite section of treebolic space , with @xmath29 .    why is this space interesting@xmath30 ?",
    "first of all , it is a key example of a _ strip complex _ in the sense of @xcite .",
    "strip complexes are a class of riemannian complexes .",
    "laplacians and the associated potential theory on riemannian complexes appear in the book of eells and fuglede  @xcite .",
    "a study of brownian motion and harmonic functions on euclidean complexes was undertaken by brin and kifer  @xcite . in @xcite , the theory of laplacians and diffusion on strip complexes , properties of the heat kernel , etc .",
    ", were studied in a careful and rigorous way . in this spirit , the present paper is the first detailed case study of what can be achieved on the basis of that theory , which provides a highly non - trivial extension of the very popular subject of analysis and probability on `` quantum graphs '' ( metric graphs ) to what one might also call `` quantum complexes '' .",
    "second , treebolic space is a horosphere in the product space @xmath31 , where the tree @xmath4 is viewed as a one - dimensional complex in which each edge is a copy of a suitable compact interval . in other words",
    ", it is the _ horocyclic product _ of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "a first appearance of such a horocyclic product was that of two trees with ( integer ) branching numbers @xmath15 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "this is the diestel - leader graph @xmath33 , which for @xmath34 was proposed by diestel and leader  @xcite as a candidate example to answer the following question of woess  @xcite : is there a vertex - transitive graph which is not quasi - isometric with a cayley graph ?",
    "it was only quite recently that eskin , fisher and whyte finally showed , as part of impressive work  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that @xmath33 is indeed such an example . on the other hand , in case of equal branching numbers of the two trees , @xmath35 is a cayley graph of the lamplighter group @xmath36 .",
    "this geometric realisation of the latter lead to a good understanding of random walks , spectra and boundary theory of those groups , the dl - graphs , and of horocyclic products of more than 2 trees , see the work of bertacchi , bartholdi , brofferio , neuhauser , woess @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    besides @xmath33",
    ", treebolic space has another , more classical sister structure .",
    "this is @xmath37 , the horocyclic product of two hyperbolic planes with curvatures @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , where @xmath40 . besides being a @xmath41-dimensional riemannian manifold ,",
    "@xmath37 can be seen as a lie group , which is the semidirect product of @xmath42 with @xmath43 induced by the action @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is one of thurston s eight model geometries in dimension 3 .",
    "the brownian motion generated by the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath37 is studied in detail in a sister paper to the present one , by brofferio , salvatori and woess  @xcite .",
    "the analogy between @xmath33 and @xmath37 becomes also apparent in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where the quasi - isometry classes of these graphs , resp .",
    "manifolds are determined .",
    "coming back to treebolic space , we mention that like the above sister structures , it is neither gromov hyperbolic nor cat(0 ) .",
    "we shall explain below that the amenable baumslag - solitar group @xmath47 acts on @xmath48 by isometries and with compact quotient .",
    "this fact has been exploited by farb and mosher  @xcite ( without describing the space as a horocyclic product ) in order to determine the quasi - isometry types of the baumslag - solitar groups . on the other hand",
    ", we shall see that for @xmath34 , no discrete group can act in such a way on our space .",
    "in the present paper , in  [ sec : geometry ] we first exhibit more details about the geometry of treebolic space and its metric @xmath49 and explain its isometry group , which is ( up to the obvious reflections with respect to vertical hyperplanes ) obtained as a `` horocyclic '' product of the group @xmath50 of all affine mappings @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath18 , @xmath53 ) and the affine group of the tree @xmath54 , that is , the group of all automorphisms ( self - isometries ) of the tree that fix a given boundary point .",
    "we next , in  [ sec : laplacians ] , turn our attention to the laplace operator on @xmath10 , whose rigorous construction as an essentially self - adjoint diffusion operator bears a serious challenge in view of the singularities which our structure has along the bifurcation lines .",
    "this challenge was faced in the general setting of strip complexes in @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", we consider a family of laplacians @xmath55 with two `` vertical drift '' parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 . when looking at bownian motion ( bm ) , that is , the diffusion @xmath58 on @xmath10 whose infinitesimal generator is @xmath59 , it is hyperbolic bm with linear drift parameter @xmath56 in the interior of each strip . on the other hand , @xmath57 is responsible for the random choice of the strip into which bm should make its next infinitesimal step when the current position is on one of the bifurcation lines .",
    "the overall drift relies on both in terms of the number @xmath60 .",
    "the drift is @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 , while bm has an `` upwards '' ( resp .",
    "`` downwards '' ) drift when @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) .",
    "the laplacian and brownian motion admit natural projections on @xmath4 and @xmath0 , as well as on @xmath42 .",
    "the projection onto @xmath42 associates with each point its height : it is the busemann function with respect to the boundary point at infininty of @xmath0 ( as well as of the tree ) .",
    "the projected brownian motion @xmath65 on @xmath0 is in general not ordinary hyberbolic bm with drift parameter @xmath56 , except when @xmath66 .",
    "that is , it evolves like hyperbolic bm with drift in the interior of each of the strips @xmath67 into which @xmath0 has been `` sliced '' , while it receives an additional vertical `` kick '' ( absent only when @xmath68 ) on each of the lines @xmath69 .",
    "the projection @xmath70 on @xmath4 is a typical example of bm on a metric graph ( the tree ) .",
    "the study of the corresponding laplace operators is by now well established , and more straightforward than the higher dimensional version on strip complexes that we are dealing with here .",
    "see e.g. cattaneo  @xcite , keller and lenz  @xcite , bendikov and saloff - coste  @xcite .",
    "analogously , the projection @xmath71 on @xmath42 evolves like ordinary bm with drift as long as it does not visit any integer .",
    "when it visits an integer , bm receives an additional random `` kick '' in the positive or negative direction .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to describe how brownian motion on @xmath10 evolves spatially .",
    "main tool for this study is the sequence @xmath72 of the stopping times of the successive visits of @xmath73 in the bifurcation lines @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath74 ( the vertex set of the tree ) . the increments @xmath75 are i.i.d . for @xmath76 ,",
    "have exponential moments and an explicitly computable laplace transform , see  [ sec : rw ] .",
    "that section contains further basic preliminary results .",
    "in particular , we study the distribution of the location of the process at time @xmath77 , which is the law governing the process @xmath78 .",
    "this is quite subtle , because the singularities of our structure require care when trying to implement methods that appear to be `` obvious '' in the classical smooth setting .",
    "the state space of the induced markov process @xmath79 is the disjoint union of all bifurcation lines .",
    "the projection @xmath80 of that process on @xmath0 can be interpreted as a random walk on the group @xmath50 .",
    "it can be treated via the methods of the work of grincevicius @xcite , @xcite . at the same time , the projection @xmath81 is a nearest neighbour random walk on the ( vertex set of the ) tree whose transition probabilities",
    "are invariant under the action of the affine group of @xmath4 .",
    "it can also be considered as a random walk on that group .",
    "random walks of this type were studied in detail by cartwright , kaimanovich and woess  @xcite .",
    "the synthesis of those results on the two affine groups of @xmath0 and of @xmath4 is crucial for our study .    in  [",
    "sec : boundary ] , we consider the natural geometric boundary at infinity of @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath10 is naturally embedded in the direct product @xmath31 , its natural compactification is its closure in @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath10 is the set of points added in this way . here",
    ", @xmath83 is the well - known end compactification of the tree , while @xmath84 is the classical compactification of hyperbolic plane ( the closed unit disk in the disk model of @xmath0 , or equivalently  in the upper half plane situation  the upper half plane together with its bottom line @xmath42 and the `` upper '' boundary point at infinity ) .",
    "we show that in the topology of that compactification , brownian motion on @xmath10 converges almost surely to a limit random variable that lives on the boundary .",
    "in general , we can get quite good information about the law of that limit random variable , but it can be given explicitly only in special cases regarding the choice of the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "convergence to the boundary goes hand in hand with computation of the linear _ rate of escape _",
    "@xmath85 , that is , @xmath86 it is the same as the rate of escape of @xmath87 on @xmath42 .",
    "a basic tool for boundary convergence and rate of escape is the the notion of _ regular sequences _ of kaimanovich  @xcite .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : clt ] , we derive a central limit theorem , concerning convergence in law of @xmath88 when @xmath89 , the limit law is centred normal distribution , and we also explain how to compute its variance @xmath90 . when @xmath91 , the result as well as the limit distribution are somewhat more complicated .",
    "the interplay of bm with the boundary provides the bridge to the potential theoretic part of our work , that will be laid out in forthcoming work @xcite .    in concluding the introduction , we want to underline how similar the geometric features as well as the properties of brownian motion ( resp .",
    "random walks ) and the associated harmonic functions are on dl - graphs & lampligher groups , the @xmath92-manifold ( resp . ) and treebolic space . in spite of the different techniques needed for each of the three , the realisation of those analogies , as well as the detailed study undertaken here , have become possible via the geometric interpretation of those stuctures as horocyclic products",
    ".    on the other hand , as already indicated , the elaboration and use of the analytic and probabilistic tools for this study are quite subtle in view of the singularities of @xmath10 at the bifurcation lines , thus providing a first concrete implementation of the analysis on strip complexes developed in @xcite .",
    "we start by describing the relevant features of the homogeneous tree @xmath1 . here",
    ", we consider @xmath4 as a one - complex , where each edge is a copy of the unit interval @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the discrete graph metric @xmath94 on the vertex set ( @xmath61-skeleton ) @xmath95 of @xmath4 is the length ( number of edges ) on the shortest path between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this metric has an obvious `` linear '' extension to the one - skeleton .",
    "we partition the vertex set into countably many sets @xmath98 , @xmath18 , such that each @xmath99 is countably infinite , and every vertex @xmath100 has precisely one neighbour @xmath101 ( the _ predecessor _ of @xmath25 ) in @xmath102 and @xmath15 neighbours in @xmath103 ( the _ successors _ of @xmath25 ) , each of with has @xmath25 as its predecessor .",

    "the sets @xmath99 are called _",
