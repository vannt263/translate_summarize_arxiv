    "in this chapter , we give a brief sketch about the field of complexity science : the questions that led to the emergence of this new approach to understand real - world structures and their dynamics .",
    "we discuss in particular the emergence of the new field of research - _ network science _ , and the various network models , their characteristic properties and their time - dependent dynamic behaviour . in relation to the theme of the thesis ,",
    "we outline the significance of complex networks approach to understand public transportation infrastructures .",
    "further , we review the literature in the area of structurally constrained network of bus routes in urban cities , which forms the core of the thesis .",
    "we end this section by elaborating on dynamical processes , like information percolation and phase - transition in networks in general , and epidemic spreading in transportation networks in particular .",
    "nonlinearity is the essence of reality .",
    "the emergence of the field of complexity science is often attributed to the fact that real - world processes are indeterministic due to the presence of numerous variables and their nonlinear combinations .",
    "real - world systems are also hard to comprehend because the agents constituting those systems show non - trivial interactions between them . in the context of these systems",
    ", it is always observed that the system as a whole is greater than its constituting parts  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these systems are complex not only because of their scale but also because of their functionality .",
    "the growing interest to understand the underlying machinery of these _ complex systems _ has given rise to numerous mathematical and simulation techniques .",
    "some of the widely used techniques include agent - based modelling , time series analysis , ant - colony optimization , cellular automata , nonlinear differential equations , information theory and network theory  @xcite . amongst these existing mathematical methods ,",
    "network theory in particular has been immensely successful in describing real world systems and processes in the recent times .",
    "the underlying mathematical concepts of network theory or commonly , network science , is the theory of graphs .",
    "one of the oldest examples of using graph theory to analyze real - world problem dates back to as early as 1736 , when the resolution to the famous knigsberg bridge problem by euler actually laid the foundations of graph theory ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the abstract approach by euler made the geographical intricacies present in the problem seem totally irrelevant .",
    "his although simple , yet abstract formulation of the problem in terms of vertices ( nodes ) and edges ( links ) provided an elegant approach to model real - world structures as graphs or networks .",
    "the first physical application of graph - theoretical ideas was discovered by gustav kirchhoff in 1845 for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits . since then",
    ", the use of graph theory as a modelling technique has found innumerable applications across diverse disciplines .",
    "one of the very important properties that these network models capture is the way different agents interact with each other in a connected system , which gives rise to non - trivial ( emergent ) properties in the system .",
    "be it social ties or technological interactions , socio - economic infrastructures or interaction between biological entities , almost every thing can be modelled as a graph containing nodes and edges  @xcite .",
    "complex network science today has established itself as a mainstream field of research in the physical sciences .",
    "although , the fundamental breakthroughs in network science are often attributed to statistical physicists and mathematicians , the origin of this field of study surprisingly lies in the social sciences .",
    "two spectacular examples of studies that gave birth to network science as we know it today are that of milgram s ` small - world experiment ' of 1967 and granovetter s theory on the spread of information in social networks in 1973  @xcite . the results from milgram s experiment helped us to understand how closely connected we are through our social ties whereas granovetter s theory stressed on the importance of the individual connection that a node shares in the network .",
    "both the observations led to an increased surge of interest in this new field of study by mathematicians and social scientists . with the advancement in information technology that enabled availability of large amounts of real - world data and improved computational resources ,",
    "physicists eventually came into the picture in the early 1990 s .",
    "it was during this time that the structure and topology of large - scale complex networks were being studied and fundamental questions like the nature of connections and in general , the statistical properties of the network s building blocks or the nodes were being asked .",
    "the field which initially branched out from the mathematical theory of graphs suddenly found its applications and similarities to statistical physics .",
    "no longer were the properties of the single node a question of interest .",
    "the group behaviour of the nodes - how they connect to each other - became a significant non - trivial question of academic pursuit .",
    "the field of network science has emerged out of the mathematical theory of graphs .",
    "therefore , the underlying mathematical structure of the networks and its various characteristic properties use the language of graph theory for theoretical and computational purposes .",
    "before we go into the details of the theoretical questions of interests ( those we pointed out earlier ) , it is necessary to first mathematically describe a network and discuss certain characteristic features of these graphs , which are of interest in the particular context of the thesis .",
    "we will also observe later that these are the properties which help in differentiating between various network models .",
    "adjacency matrix is diagonally - symmetric.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we define a graph , @xmath0 where the set @xmath1 where each @xmath2 is a node , and the set @xmath3 where each @xmath4 is a link connecting the node pair @xmath5 .",
    "the set of nodes belong to the n - dimensional euclidean space , @xmath6 , and the set of links form the cartesian product over @xmath6 .",
    "a graph can be directed or undirected .",
    "if a graph is directed , then @xmath7 , whereas if a graph is undirected , we have @xmath8 . another important mathematical structure associated with graphs",
    "is the adjacency matrix , @xmath9 .",
    "the adjacency matrix is a representation of the network as a @xmath10 square matrix .",
    "each element , @xmath11 either takes a value of @xmath12 or @xmath13 when the graph is unweighted . when @xmath14 the link @xmath4 does not exist , whereas @xmath15 or @xmath13 signifies the directionality of the link ( with @xmath16 in first case and @xmath17 in the latter ) . if the graph in question is a weighted graph , then @xmath18 can take any real value .",
    "the weights in the graph can represent diverse quantities , such as strength of connections ( social network ) , frequency of interactions ( call networks ) , travel times ( transportation networks ) , distances ( road networks ) , etc .",
    "for an undirected graph , the directionality of the links does not play any role ( @xmath8 ) , and the adjacency matrix takes on a diagonally - symmetric form .",
    "also , note that @xmath19 represents self - loops in the network ( see figure 2 )  @xcite .",
    "an important measure is the characteristic path length , @xmath20 which is defined as the average number of nodes crossed along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes .",
    "the average distance from a certain vertex to every other vertex is given by @xmath21 .",
    "then , @xmath20 is calculated by taking the median of all the calculated @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic path length helps in identifying whether a small - world phenomenon exists in the network or not .",
    "the significance of the small - world property is two - fold : one , it signifies very low characteristic path length , which simply means that given any pair of randomly chosen nodes , the number of ` hops ' needed to reach one from the other will be very low as compared to the network size ; second , it also characterizes the change in the metric , @xmath20 as the network size changes ( the number of nodes present in a network is called its size )  @xcite .",
    "milgram s experiment showed that on an average any randomly chosen pair of individuals are separated by six acquaintances ( hence , the popular term : _ six - degrees of separation _ ) .",
    "another important network metric is the the clustering coefficient which measures the extent to which nodes tend to cluster in a network .",
    "the concept of clustering coefficient originated mainly from studying social networks , where a pair of individuals are connected by a link if they are friends .",
    "in social networks , close friends tend to have close - knit communities where each individual in the group knows every other individual . in figure 3",
    ", we can observe that the maximum number of triangles possible for the blue node is three .",
    "in the first case , since every node is connected to every other node , the magnitude of clustering coefficient is one . whereas , in the second and the last case when the dotted ( red ) links are removed , the possible number of triangles gets reduced to one and subsequently to zero .",
    "hence , the magnitude of clustering coefficient in the second case is one - third and zero in the latter .",
    "the above example denotes the local clustering coefficient , which is in reference to a particular node in the network .",
    "the local clustering coefficient is given by : @xmath24 in the above expression , @xmath25 are the neighbours of the node @xmath2 and the neighbourhood , @xmath26 , for a node , @xmath2 is defined as the set of its immediately connected neighbours , as @xmath27 . for the complete network ,",
    "watts and strogatz defined a global clustering coefficient , @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "hence , the clustering coefficient measures the extent to which nodes tend to form close - knit groups in a network .",
    "a network with a small characteristic path length and a high clustering coefficient is called a small - world network .    ) in an undirected graph . in the first case , @xmath29 as every node is connected to every other node . in the second case , the removal of two links ( red , dotted ) causes the number of triangles for the blue node to reduce to @xmath30 , hence @xmath31 . in the last case ,",
    "an additional removal of link causes the number of triangles for the blue node to reduce to zero , therefore @xmath32.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    although the above metrics are crucial in identifying small - world phenomenon in a network , they do not help us in understanding the network topology .",
    "understanding the network topology holds the key to several interesting and non - trivial questions . in order",
    "to answer questions about network robustness or node centrality , we need to look at the pattern by which the nodes are connected in the network .",
    "before we go into the details of various degree - distribution patterns , we define the quantity - degree ( of a node ) in a network .",
    "the degree of a node is the number of neighbours to which it is directly connected to . in an undirected graph ,",
    "the degree of a node is mathematically expressed as @xmath33 . in a directed graph",
    ", the degree of a node will depend upon the directionality of the links which either emerge _ out _ of the node or converge _ into _ the node .",
    "therefore , in a directed graph , a node will have an out - degree ( @xmath34 ) and an in - degree ( @xmath35 ) , with @xmath36 , where the index @xmath37 runs over all the positive @xmath18 and vice - versa .",
    "when the network as a whole is studied , the significance of an individual node takes the backseat ( unless we are interested in node - specific properties ) , and the way the degree of every single node is distributed throughout the network becomes a question of extreme interest .",
    "we define degree - distribution ( @xmath38 ) of a network as the probability that a node , @xmath2 has a degree of atleast @xmath25 .",
    "the notion of degree - distribution holds a central role in network science .",
    "networks that follow a similar degree - distribution law tend to show similar network characteristics .",
    "therefore , the degree - distribution function can be used as a signature to differentiate between different network classes . among all the possible degree - distribution laws ,",
    "the ones that are most frequently encountered are the poisson , exponential and power - law patterns .",
    "the poissonion form of degree - distribution is given by : @xmath39 similarly , the exponential degree - distribution is given by : @xmath40 and finally , the power - law degree distribution is given by : @xmath41 in the above expressions , @xmath42 denotes the average node - degree , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the exponential and power - law degree exponents .",
    "although all the distribution functions @xmath45 ( in eqn . 2 , 3 , 4 ) decay for large magnitudes of @xmath46 , a special feature of the distributions in eqn . 2 and 3",
    "is that they contain a typical scale .",
    "it is either the location of the maximum for the poisson distribution , or the characteristic decay length for the exponential .",
    "on the contrary , the power - law distribution in eqn .",
    "4 does not contain such a scale .",
    "networks with a power - law degree - distribution are therefore called scale - free networks . when the degree - exponent , @xmath47 , the average node degree diverges and when @xmath48 , the standard deviation of the degree diverges  @xcite .",
    "2 , 3 and 4 are probability density functions , therefore : @xmath49 for the continuous case and @xmath50 for the discrete case .",
    "the constant , @xmath51 is known as the normalization constant . clearly , the distribution in eqn .",
    "4 diverges as @xmath52 so eqn .",
    "4 can not hold for all @xmath53 , _",
    "i.e. _ , there must be some lower - bound to the power - law behavior  @xcite .",
    "we will denote this bound by @xmath54 .",
    "then , provided @xmath55 , it is straightforward to calculate the normalizing constant , and we find that : @xmath56 for the discrete case , the distribution in eqn .",
    "4 diverges when @xmath57 , so there must be a lower bound @xmath58 on the power - law behavior . on calculating the normalizing constant , we find that : @xmath59 where the hurwitz zeta function , @xmath60 is given by : @xmath61        the poisson distribution is strongly peaked about the mean @xmath42 , and has a tail that decays very rapidly as @xmath62 .",
    "this rapid decay is completely different from the heavy - tailed degree - distribution that is observed in many real - world complex networks .",
    "real - world networks tend to show a degree heterogeneity , _",
    "i.e. _ , very a small fraction of nodes tend to hold majority of the connections in the network which are called as ` hubs ' .",
    "instead of having a normally distributed degree in the network about the mean degree ( poissonian distribution function ) , real - world networks show tails which are heavily skewed towards the right . also , it is hard to find real - world networks that show a perfect power - law or an exponential distribution , therefore majority of the networks tend to show a combination of them , such as power - law degree - distribution with exponential cut - offs or a combination of different power exponents .",
    "whatever the case may be , it is important that we find proper explanations to these non - trivial characteristics of the real - world complex networks . in the following sections , we will elaborate on the important network models that will answer some of the interesting features of the networks that we saw earlier .",
    "also , these are not the exhaustive list of network properties to be analyzed .",
    "we will see in the later sections that there are numerous other network metrics that describe both the global network properties and local nodal characteristics .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the three prominent network models .",
    "starting with the random graph model by paul erds ( see figure 4 ) and alfred rnyi in 1959 that laid the fundamental ideas of network science , we look into the small - world properties present in a network by duncan watts and steven strogatz in 1998 . finally , in order to understand the presence of heavy tails in degree - distribution patterns of real - world networks , we look into the scale - free network model proposed by albert - lszl barabsi and rka albert also in 1998 .",
    "the erds - rnyi ( er ) model is either of the two closely related network models in graph theory for generating random graphs  @xcite . in the model introduced by erds and rnyi , @xmath63 , the number of vertices ( @xmath64 ) and the number of edges ( @xmath65 ) are fixed , implying that all possible graph combinations are equally likely .",
    "whereas in the model introduced by gilbert , @xmath66 , each edge has a fixed probability @xmath67 , of being present or absent , independently of the other edges . therefore , in the @xmath66 model , a graph is constructed by connecting nodes randomly with each edge having a fixed probability @xmath67 independent from every other edge .",
    "therefore , all graphs with @xmath64 nodes and @xmath65 links have equal probability of @xmath68 .",
    "as the parameter @xmath67 in this model increases from @xmath69 , the model becomes more likely to include graphs with more edges and less likely to include graphs with fewer edges .",
    "in particular , when @xmath70 all @xmath71 graphs on @xmath64 vertices are chosen with equal probability .",
    "one of the interesting features of the er random graph is the degree - distribution patterns of the nodes which follow the binomial form , @xmath72 and approaches the poissonian form as in eqn . 2 when @xmath73 and @xmath74 constant .",
    "some of the important features about random graphs that erds and rnyi pointed out are  @xcite :    * if @xmath75 , then a graph in @xmath66 will almost surely have no connected components of size larger than @xmath76 * if @xmath77 , then a graph in @xmath66 will almost surely have a largest component whose size is of order @xmath78 * if @xmath79 , then a graph in @xmath66 will almost surely have a unique giant component containing a positive fraction of the vertices and no other component will contain more than @xmath76 vertices    although these models ( @xmath63 and @xmath80 ) can be used in the probabilistic method to prove the existence of graphs satisfying various properties , or to provide a rigorous definition of what it means for a property to hold for almost all graphs , they hardly capture the essence of the real - world network properties .    , with increasing wiring probability @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( left to right ) and @xmath83 . for @xmath84 the number of links present @xmath85 .",
    "similarly for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . observe how a ten - fold increase in probability causes the number of links to increase roughly by ten times.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the er model provides a good mathematical description of graphs and the various properties associated with them .",
    "although there may be instances when er graphs show exceptionally small characteristic path lengths , they however do not show two important properties observed in many real - world networks :    * presence of clusters or triadic closures @xmath88 er graphs have low clustering coefficient * presence of exceptionally high degree nodes or hubs @xmath88 degree - distributions in er graphs converge to a poisson form rather than a power - law pattern    in order to address the first of the above two limitations , duncan watts and steven strogatz devised a simple model that kept the characteristic path length small ( similar to a random graph ) but added the additional attribute of clustering .",
    "the model interpolated between a regular ring lattice and an er random graph , and was able to explain the small - world phenomenon to some extent  @xcite . given a fixed number of nodes @xmath89 , mean degree @xmath42 ( assumed to be an even integer ) , and a special parameter @xmath67 , satisfying @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the algorithm constructs an undirected graph with @xmath89 nodes and @xmath92 edges in the following way ( see figure 6 ) :    * construct a regular ring lattice , a graph with @xmath89 nodes each connected to @xmath42 neighbors , @xmath93 on either side , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the nodes are labeled @xmath94 , there is an edge @xmath95 if and only if @xmath96 * for every node @xmath97 take every edge @xmath95 with @xmath98 , and rewire it with probability @xmath67 .",
    "rewiring is done by replacing @xmath95 with @xmath99 where @xmath65 is chosen with uniform probability from all possible values that avoid self - loops @xmath100 and link duplication ( there is no edge @xmath101 with @xmath102 at this point in the algorithm )     plays a crucial role .",
    "when @xmath103 , we have a regular ring lattice , whereas at @xmath104 , we have a random graph , @xmath80 with @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xcite.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we list out some network characteristics of the watts - strogatz small - world network model ( ws ) .",
    "the degree distribution in the case of the ring lattice is the dirac delta function centered at @xmath42 , which assumes the poisson form in the limiting case of @xmath107 ( eqn .",
    "2 ) , similar to the classical er random graphs  @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution for @xmath108 can be written as : @xmath109 where @xmath25 is the degree of the @xmath110 node , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the shape of the degree - distribution curve is similar to that of a random graph and has a pronounced peak at @xmath113 , which decays exponentially for large @xmath114 .",
    "the topology of the network is relatively homogeneous , and all nodes have more or less the same degree .",
    "the additional feature that the ws model exhibits is the property of forming triadic closures or clusters .",
    "the clustering coefficient is given as the ratio of the number of triangles present among the nodes to the total number of connected triplets among them ( see figure 3 ) . in terms of @xmath67 , @xmath115 where , @xmath116 is the clustering coefficient of a regular ring lattice given by @xmath117 and @xmath118 as @xmath119 .",
    "the ws model preserves the short characteristic path lengths exhibited by random graphs . for a regular ring lattice ,",
    "the characteristic path length is given by @xmath120 , which in the limiting case @xmath121 approaches to @xmath122 or @xmath123 for a random graph .",
    "thus , the number of hops required to visit all the nodes in a network scales as the logarithm of the network size , which still remains a very low number even though the network size is large ( or grows with time ) .",
    "the small - world property has been reported in various real - world networks such as electric power grids , www , internet , social - networks , protein - yeast ( metabolite ) interaction networks , citation networks , movie - actors collaboration networks @xcite .",
    "although these networks show small characteristic path lengths and high clustering , they also exhibit a heavy - tailed degree - distribution that can not be explained either by the er or the ws models . in order to understand the mechanism of growth and evolution of real - world networks ,",
    "we analyze the barabsi - albert scale - free model in the following section .",
    "albert - lszl barabsi , along with his doctoral student rka albert published two important articles in the late 90 s  @xcite . in both the articles , they pointed out the peculiarity in the patterns of degree - distribution in real - world networks .",
    "they observed that the degree - distribution laws did not follow the poissonian form nor the usually expected normal form .",
    "the density functions decayed slower than exponentials and log - normals , and showed a heavy - tail towards their end .",
    "interestingly , their studies also confirmed the small - world property in these real - world datasets .    in order to understand the growth and evolution of real - world networks exhibiting scale - free nature , barabsi and albert proposed an algorithm ( ba model ) that generates random networks with power - law degree - distribution patterns .",
    "the two salient features of the ba model are : _ growth _ and _ preferential attachment _ , both of which widely exist in real - world networks .",
    "the presence of preferential attachment allowed networks to exhibit degree - heterogeneity .",
    "a small fraction of nodes tend to attract more connections as compared to others , for example , highly influential people in a social network , important airports in an airline network or web pages , like google . in a way ,",
    "preferential attachment acted as a positive feedback loop for the network or initiated the ` rich getting richer ' phenomenon in the network .",
    "the earlier models failed to provide an explanation to this particularly observed phenomenon .",
    "barabsi and albert in their model incorporated this property and came up with the class of scale - free networks .",
    "the ba model , with growth and preferential attachment can be mathematically described using continuum theory , which calculates the time - dependence of the degree of a node  @xcite .",
    "incorporating growth causes the network size to increase with time due to new incoming nodes .",
    "the preferential attachment is taken care by assigning a probability , @xmath124 for the new node to attach to an existing node in the network , such that @xmath125 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath25 is a continuous real variable and the rate at which @xmath25 changes is proportional to @xmath124 . starting with a small number ( @xmath126 ) of nodes , we add at every time - step a new node with @xmath127 edges .",
    "the real variable , @xmath25 satisfies the dynamical equation : @xmath128 where @xmath129 leading to : @xmath130 the solution to the above equation with the initial condition that every node introduced at time @xmath131 has @xmath127 edges @xmath132 is given by @xmath133 , with @xmath134 . using eqn .",
    "11 , the probability that a node has a degree @xmath135 smaller than @xmath46 , @xmath136 can be written as : @xmath137 since the nodes are added at equal time intervals , the parameter @xmath131 has a constant probability density , @xmath138 . substituting the value of @xmath139 into eqn .",
    "12 , we obtain : @xmath140 the degree - distribution @xmath45 can be obtained by : @xmath141 the above equation can be written in the asymptotic ( @xmath142 ) limit as @xmath143 , with @xmath144 .",
    "the above result is independent of the number of links ( @xmath127 ) an incoming node has .",
    "therefore , ba model produces scale - free networks with degree - distribution following pure power - laws with degree exponent , @xmath145 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "although ba model generates networks obeying pure power - law degree - distributions , real - world networks on the contrary mostly show a heavy tail .",
    "the reason for this can be attributed to several factors , such as non - linear preferential attachment , node aging , node s competitiveness to acquire incoming links , or presence of exponential cut - offs  @xcite .",
    "even though real - world networks may not follow strict power - laws , the presence of preferential attachment is extremely crucial . without the presence of the preferential attachment",
    ", rule networks can not exhibit heavy - tailed degree - distribution patterns because the preferential attachment rule acts as a positive reinforcement in the network .",
    "ba models , without growth have also been proposed . however , network models without the attachment rule will result into random graphs  @xcite . the characteristic path length for ba networks",
    "is given as @xmath146 .",
    "for @xmath147 , the characteristic path length has been found to decay as @xmath148 , thus making the topology of scale - free networks ultra - small in nature  @xcite .     and @xmath149 .",
    "the node size reflects the node degree , @xmath150 , nodes which have bigger size have higher degrees and vice versa . in the right panel , we plot the degree - distribution of the network on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "the degree - distribution follows a power - law pattern , @xmath151 , with @xmath145 .",
    "the parameter , @xmath44 is calculated from the slope of the degree - distribution plot in the right panel ( red , dotted).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the availability of huge amounts of real - time data and sudden surge of interest in the field of networks have attracted numerous researchers working in applied sciences as well .",
    "particular in this context are those civil engineers whose research is primarily focused in the domain of transportation networks .",
    "although the study of transportation networks have a long history , the questions of interests have significantly changed after the introduction of network science techniques . the traditional network flow formulation ( in transportation networks )",
    "has answered many interesting engineering questions related to optimality of cost , maximality of flows and the classical shortest path determination  @xcite .",
    "questions , those related to the topological structure of the network , such as the presence of small - world property or heavy - tailed degree - distribution patterns , or questions which are primarily concerned with the inter - nodal connectivity and static ( dynamic ) evolution of the network which the traditional formulation failed to address , found answers in the network science domain .",
    "one particular type of transportation network that found widespread interest in the network science community is that of the public transit network or ptn .",
    "a topological drawback of ptns is that they are structurally constrained in a two - dimensional space as compared to other networks , such as the internet , social networks or the airline networks .",
    "airline and metro - networks , specifically have been reported to show scale - free degree distribution patterns , whereas degree - distribution in bus and railway networks tend more towards exponential forms ( or to power - law patterns with larger magnitudes of @xmath44 ) . yet ,",
    "the above mentioned properties - small - world phenomenon and scale - free topology - have been reported in them as well @xcite . in some studies ,",
    "specific subsets of ptns were analyzed , for example , the boston subway network , the vienna subway network , or bus networks of three cities in china  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that each separate type of public transport ( bus , subway , trams or mono - rail network ) is not a closed system : these are only sub - networks of a much wider city transport system .",
    "an interesting observation was reported when network characteristics obtained while separately analyzing subway networks were compared to those of the network combination of subway and buses  @xcite .",
    "statistical analysis of complete ptns for cities , such as berlin , paris , dsseldorf and 22 polish cities showed that power - law degree - distribution pattern is a common feature  @xcite .",
    "they also concluded that the degree - distribution patterns for ptns can have both exponential as well as power - law forms , depending upon the topology of the network representation chosen and presence of geographical constraints .",
    "the small - world phenomenon in transportation networks makes sense as transportation facilities in a city are planned to provide maximum convenience to its people by allowing them to travel between places in minimum possible time .",
    "most transportation networks are pre - planned networks , where the initial design of the network decides the presence of hubs . also , the size of transportation networks is not as large compared to social - networks or the internet , and are subjected to geographical as well as socio - economical constraints .",
    "the reason for the contrasting behaviour of the airline and metro networks from bus and rail networks can be attributed to the two following observations : ( * i * ) airline - networks ( like the internet or social - networks ) are not bounded by geographical constraints , and ( * ii * ) metro - networks are _ local _ often catering to a part of the city , whereas bus and railway - networks are _ global _ as they are spread throughout the entire state and sometimes across the entire country . specific to indian scenarios , exhaustive studies on public transit networks as a whole are yet to be conducted .",
    "previous works , have shown that the pattern of nodal connectivity of the indian railway network ( irn ) drastically differs from that of the airport network of india ( ani ) , while the nature of indian bus networks still remains an unsolved problem  @xcite .",
    "the central theme of the thesis lies around the topological structure and dynamics of bus transport networks or btns in india .",
    "the presence of comparatively less number of studies on btns among other modes of transportation is one of the fundamental reasons that their characteristic properties and their topological structures are yet inconclusive . in this section",
    ", we present the currently available literature on the studies pertaining to btns in specific .",
    "analysis of the statistical properties of btns in china have revealed scale - free degree - distribution patterns and small - world properties in them .",
    "the presence of nontrivial clustering , _ i.e. _ , the variation of clustering with degree , indicated a hierarchical and modular structure in those btns .",
    "weighted analysis of the network revealed a heavy - tailed power law with the strength ( weighted - degree ) and degree showing a linear dependency  @xcite . in another study , the btns of four major cities of china , namely",
    ", hangzhou , nanjing , beijing and shanghai were analyzed using @xmath152-space topology .",
    "the degree - distribution was reported to follow an exponential form , indicating a tendency for random attachment of the nodes .",
    "the authors also evaluated two new statistical properties of the btns : the distribution of number of stops in a bus route ( @xmath153 ) , and the number of bus routes a stop joins ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "while the former had an exponential functional form , the latter had an asymmetric unimodal functional form  @xcite . in a separate study ,",
    "the urban public bus networks of two chinese cities , beijing and chengdu were analyzed .",
    "their analysis revealed small world characteristics and a scale - free topology , although with exceptionally high values for the degree - exponent , @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of more hubs in the beijing network yielded a smaller @xmath44 as compared to chengdu ; while both showed large clustering coefficients and small characteristic path lengths .",
    "the location of bus stops in a similar fashion in both the cities have led to a hierarchical structure , which is denoted by a power - law behaviour ( with nearly same exponents ) between the degree strength ( characterizing the passenger flows ) and clustering coefficient  @xcite .    in a recent study ,",
    "the combination of rail ( rtns ) and bus transportation systems ( btns ) in singapore were studied with respect to their topological as well as dynamical perspectives .",
    "the stations in rtns had high average degree indicating high connectivity amongst them , while the btns had a small average degree .",
    "both networks had an exponential degree - distribution indicative of randomly evolved connectivity .",
    "strength - distribution of the nodes ( weighted degree - distribution ) however showed scale - free topology for both networks , indicating the existence of high traffic hubs .",
    "both btns and rtns exhibited small - world characteristics .",
    "the btn in particular had a hierarchical star like topology .",
    "degree - assortativity ( @xmath155 ) , which measures the inter - connectivity between hubs , revealed rtns to be slightly disassortative , while the btns displayed strong disassortative nature  @xcite . with the availability of geo - located data , an extended space ( es ) model with information on geographical location of bus stops and routes",
    "was recently used to analyze the spatial characteristics of btns in china . the @xmath156 model consisted of",
    "directed weighted variations of the @xmath157- and @xmath152-space networks , designated as es-@xmath157 and es-@xmath152 networks respectively . often , two bus stops which are geographically close to each other",
    "may not have any direct bus route link between them .",
    "however , such stops are at walkable distances from each other .",
    "these are defined as short - distance station pairs or ssps .",
    "the ssps greatly influence the btns by reducing the transfer times as well as the number of bus routes . the symmetry - weighted esw network model stored information of the ssps .",
    "the average clustering coefficient of the esw network was considerably large , denoting a nearly circular location of the ssps around a station .",
    "majority of the route sections in the bus routes were short , while a few route sections connecting cities downtowns and satellite towns or special purpose routes were long , leading to a power - law edge length distribution of the es-@xmath157 network  @xcite .",
    "it may seem at first that the complexity of a bus transportation network is much lesser than that of other large - scale networks , however it is the nature of growth and the penetrative effect of these networks that makes them not only complex , but interesting and worthwhile to investigate .      in the earlier sections , we discussed about the topological characteristics of the networks in detail . in order to get a deeper insight into the network characteristics , it is important to look at the dynamical process on networks as well . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the two dynamical processes on networks in detail : network diffusion ( si model ) and network contagion ( sir model ) .",
    "the spatial characteristics of the networks along with numerical simulations of the dynamical processes will help us understand the in - depth significance of various network metrics .",
    "the earliest accounts of mathematical modelling to capture the spread of diseases dates back to as early as the @xmath158 century .",
    "bernoulli used mathematical equations to defend his stand on vaccination against the outbreak of smallpox .",
    "works following bernoulli earliest formulation of epidemic modelling helped in understanding germ theory in detail .",
    "however , this was not until the works of mckendrick and kermack , which first proposed a deterministic model that predicted epidemic outbreaks very similar to the ones that were recorded during those times  @xcite .",
    "since then our understanding of the mathematical models in epidemology has evolved over the years , the accounts of which can be found in the extensive works of anderson and may  @xcite .",
    "all the above formulations focused on modelling epidemics over a set of population in which uniform ties between agents were assumed _ a priori_. contrary to this , the field of network science asserts the fact that ties , their strength and types in a system or a population , are not uniform and they play a significant role to describe the system s dynamics  @xcite . also , a network model is not exhaustive to the study of population , rather it is a universal framework which can be used to understand numerous complex systems in general .    over the years",
    ", the term _ epidemic modelling _ has evolved into a common metaphor for a wide array of dynamical processes on these networks .",
    "various complex phenomena such as percolation , the spreading of blackouts to the spreading of memes , ideas and opinions in a social network have been modelled under the common framework of epidemic modelling  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "transportation networks play a vital role due to their widespread outreach across cities , countries and continents  @xcite .",
    "hould people be worried about getting ebola on the subway@xmath159 was one of the numerous similar headlines that made the front pages of the newspapers around the world during the 2014 ebola scare  @xcite . in this particular incident however , nobody was infected because the subject did not show symptoms of ebola while using public transportation .",
    "therefore not only airline networks , that can transmit pathogens across continents , even modes of public transport operating within cities , such as buses and subways , pose a serious threat as well as a source of panic during desperate times .",
    "although epidemic spreading in airline networks have been studied extensively , similar studies on bus networks are relatively rare  @xcite .",
    "epidemological models have been simulated on bus network datasets ; however , the results were only used to validate the numerical models .",
    "also , a recent study on city - wide integrated travel networks ( itns ) , has found both the traveling speed and frequency to be important factors in epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "thus , the effect of network structure and constraints in epidemic spreading is yet to be studied in these networks .",
    "the si model is the most basic representation of an epidemic spreading model that captures diffusion in complex networks . in this model , there are two states that an agent or a node can exist in : s ( susceptible ) or i ( infected ) .",
    "the si model describes the status of individuals or agents switching from susceptible to infected at every instant of time .",
    "it is assumed that the population is homogeneous and closed , _",
    "i.e. _ , no new entity is either created due to birth or removed due to death , and also , no new entity enters the system , thus preserving homogeneous mixing in the system .",
    "the si model also implies that each individual has the same probability to transfer disease , innovation or information to its neighbors .",
    "thus , the si model helps to capture the diffusion or percolation process in the entire network .",
    "the si model is formulated using the following differential equation . since an agent in the entire population",
    "can either be in state s or i , @xmath160 the si model is governed by a single parameter , @xmath161 , the infection transmission rate or simply , the infection rate .",
    "the growth in the number of agents in either of the sates is given by : @xmath162 substituting the value of s from eqn . 15 to eqn .",
    "16 , we get the following differential equation describing the growth rate of i : @xmath163 the solution of the above equation with the initial condition at @xmath164 , @xmath165 is given by the logistic form : @xmath166      contrary to the si model , the agents in sir model have access to three states : s ( susceptible ) , i ( infected ) and r ( recovery ) . although the earlier assumptions of a closed population and homogeneous mixing also hold in this case , the complexity of the dynamical process increases due to the addition of one more state .",
    "the agents , instead of only switching between susceptible and infected ( as in si model ) , tend to recover in the sir epidemic model .",
    "the dynamics of the sir model is controlled by two parameters : the infection rate , @xmath161 , and the recovery rate , @xmath44 .",
    "the sir model can be mathematically represented by the set of the following differential equations : @xmath167     and @xmath168 .",
    "the @xmath169axis represents the population fraction of @xmath153 , @xmath170 and @xmath154 species respectively and @xmath171axis represents simulation time.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the population of susceptible nodes decreases in proportion to the number of encounters multiplied by the probability that each encounter results in an infection .",
    "the negative sign denotes that the population of s is decreasing .",
    "similarly , we can describe the evolution of the other two states , i and r. nodes become infected at a rate proportional to the number of encounters , and the probability of infection controlled by the parameter , @xmath161 .",
    "nodes recover at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals , and the probability of recovery controlled by the parameter , @xmath44 : @xmath172 it would be interesting to analyze the spread of infection with respect to the susceptible individuals when there is a constant recovery ( from eqn .",
    "we calculate the variation in i with respect to s : @xmath173 the solution to the above equation with the initial conditions at @xmath164 , @xmath174 ( negligible as compared to the population ) and @xmath175 , is given by : @xmath176 in order to understand the rate of spread of infection in the population , we look at the rate equation for i from eqn . 20 :",
    "@xmath177 the above equation implies that the infection spreads if and only if @xmath178 . the epidemic dies out ( the number of infected individuals decreases ) if the above quantity is less than zero .",

    "25 into eqn .",

    "recovery of the individuals occur in the network if and only if the slope of @xmath187 or @xmath188 .",
    "in this section , we present our main results on the studies of btns in india .",
    "first , we discuss the motivation of our study , and then we describe the datasets used for analysis . before we discuss the primary results of this work in detail , we outline the network representation techniques specific to transportation terminology .",
    "we also saw earlier that any physical , chemical , biological or social system can be visualized as a complex network with constituting elements known as nodes , and the interactions between them identified as links . based on the nature of the links ,",
    "these networks can be broadly classified into virtual and spatial networks . in the former category , the links are physically absent , e.g. , social networks or collaboration networks , whereas in the later case",
    ", the links are physically present , e.g. , geographically embedded road or railway networks . in between these two broad classes , there exist networks in which the links , although physically absent , are still geographically constrained . the structure of the real - world networks such as bus or electric power grid are dependent upon the structure of the physically constrained , geographically embedded networks on which they grow and evolve .",
    "therefore , our study would be incomplete if we do not explain the role constraints play in geographical embeddedness .",
    "we analyze this aspect by calculating the ` dimensions ' of these networks and check for self - similar patterns in them .    in this study , we present the statistical analysis of the bus networks of six major indian cities as graphs in @xmath157- and @xmath152-spaces , using concepts from network science .",
    "although public transport networks such as airline and railway networks have been extensively studied , a comprehensive study on the structure and growth of bus networks is still lacking . in india , where btns play an important role in day - to - day commutation , it is of significant interest to analyze their topological structures and answer some of the basic questions on their growth , evolution , robustness and resiliency .",
    "therefore , we do a comparative study of the bus networks of some of the major indian cities , namely ahmedabad ( abn ) , chennai ( cbn ) , delhi ( dbn ) , hyderabad ( hbn ) , kolkata ( kbn ) and mumbai ( mbn ) . in order to understand the structure of these networks , we calculate various metrics , such as clustering coefficients , characteristic path lengths , degree - distribution and assortativity . we also simulate network robustness and resiliency by first removing nodes at random , followed by targeted removal based on degree , closeness and betweenness .",
    "simulating node removals and simultaneously capturing the variation in their characteristic path lengths helps us in understanding nodal redundancy in these networks .",
    "few studies on btns have although looked into the structural aspects in detail , the esw network that we described earlier , is the only model that has looked into the aspect of network redundancy albeit due to geographical placements of the nodes .      for this study",
    ", we use the bus routes as network datasets by considering bus stops as nodes and bus routes as links .",
    "the route details were obtained from the government websites of amts ( abn ) , mtc ( cbn ) , dtc ( dbn ) , apsrtc ( hbn ) , cstc ( kbn ) , best ( mbn ) and ahmedabad brts ( bus rapid transit system ) .",
    "it can be seen from table 1 that the network sizes of all the cities are comparable to each other , except that of kbn , because cstc is localized and operates as a subdivision of the west bengal surface transport corporation ( wbstc ) that operates buses in the entire state . for computational and visualization purposes",
    "we parse the datasets as edge - lists , where the two adjacent columns are labeled as ` source ' and ` target ' respectively . in @xmath157-space representation , the values in the respective columns represent neighboring bus stops in a given route , whereas in @xmath152-space representation , the adjacent columns represent all possible transfers in a route for a fixed value in the column of ` source ' ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "-space and @xmath152-space representation for transportation networks .",
    "if @xmath189 represents a route in @xmath157-space , then in @xmath152-space representation we have all the possible transfers for the route , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath190.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]          before we analyze the statistical properties of the different btns , we need to understand the relationship between the various network representation forms and their respective advantages .",
    "the most common is the @xmath157-space representation , where each bus stop is a node and a link between the nodes indicates that there is at least one route that services these two corresponding nodes consecutively ( see figure 9 ) . in this representation , no multiple links are allowed between a pair of nodes , or @xmath15 . in cases of route overlaps ,",
    "the element @xmath18 is multiplied with a weight element @xmath191 , thus denoting strength of that link ( or node ) : @xmath192 .",
    "a different network representation is that of a bipartite graph that has been found to be useful in the analysis of cooperation networks . in this representation , also called @xmath193-space , both routes and stops are represented by nodes and each route node is linked to all bus stops that it services , and no direct links between nodes of same type occur .",
    "the neighbors of a given route node in this representation are all those stops that it services , while the neighbors of a given bus stop are all the routes that service it  @xcite .",
    "there are two one - mode projections of the bipartite graph of @xmath193-space .",
    "the projection to the set of station nodes is the @xmath152-space graph ( see figure 9 ) , and the complementary projection to route nodes leads to the @xmath51-space graph .",
    "the @xmath152-space network representation has proven to be particularly useful in the analysis of ptns  @xcite .",
    "the nodes of this graph are bus stops , and they are linked if they are serviced by at least one common route . in this way , the neighbors of a @xmath152-space node are all those stops that can be reached without changing means of transport .    in order to get the essence of different network representations and their significance , we try to visualize the metric : characteristic length ( @xmath20 ) , which in an @xmath157-space graph is the number of ` hops ' one has to make to travel between any two randomly chosen bus stops . when the network is represented in @xmath152-space",
    ", @xmath20 signifies the number of bus changes one has to make in order to travel between any two randomly chosen bus stops . from a transportation perspective",

    "the si plot of the us airline network and abn show similar pattern of growth as both of them exhibit scale - free behaviour .",
    "however , the sir plot is similar to that of hbn due to extremely low characteristic path length and high average node degree . in table 3",
    ", we present our findings for the networks studied in the paper .",
    "the first column represents the simulation time ( in seconds ) for @xmath197 percolation threshold from the si model . in the second and third column ,",
    "we present the epidemic thresholds for the various networks studied by computing the values of the plots from the sir model ( figure 24 ) ( as a fraction of network size ) and the corresponding simulation times ( in seconds ) respectively . in the final column",

    "other than the degree of a node , closeness and betweenness centralities play a crucial role . in order to capture their effects on information diffusion , we simulate the si model on modified networks generated after directed removal of nodes .",
    "since cbn and mbn are strongly assortative , we remove only two percent of the nodes ( higher number of node removal will cause cbn and mbn to disintegrate into disconnected components ) .",
    "we find that the removal of nodes does not significantly affect the diffusion in abn .",
    "however for cbn , dbn and hbn , we observe that when nodes are removed based upon their closeness centrality , the diffusion curve shifts towards right , thus signifying a delay in the diffusion process .",
    "this can be explained due to the fact that the removal of nodes based upon closeness centrality has a direct effect on the characteristic path length .",
    "a node with high closeness allows every other node in the network to be reached along the shortest paths .",
    "the removal of such a node affects / delays diffusion until the next central node is encountered . for mbn , we observe that degree - biased removal causes the diffusion rate to increase steeply , signifying the presence of redundant nodes that simply increase the characteristic path length of the network .",
    "a removal of @xmath201 of such nodes causes the diffusion to improve significantly , as can be compared from the simulation times recorded in figure 23 .",
    "the present work places before us numerous questions of both academic as well as practical pursuit . one important practical scope of this work is in the planning of large - scale transportation networks for the future",
    ". it would be interesting to see the functionality of those networks which are planned using network science tools and techniques .",
    "another question of practical importance lies in optimizing these networks for efficient transportation and communication purposes . one important finding that could be of practical interest is the strong positive correlation between network assortativity and characteristic path length : will it be more efficient to travel on longer routes to reach hub nodes and from there to other parts of the city , or to travel though shorter routes , not reach the hub nodes but travel to other parts of the city through intermediate nodes ?    from academic pursuit , there are numerous scopes for in - depth analysis based upon this study .",
    "the current study takes into account one subset of the large - scale public transit networks",
    ". it would be interesting to do an integrated study involving other modes of transport as well .",
    "the availability of high quality geo - located data will help in actually identifying redundant nodes in the network , thus making the network more efficient .",
    "since transportation plays an important role in the economic development of a city , the present study can be extended to incorporate other networks as well , such as road networks , supply chain networks and economic networks .",
    "a holistic approach to all these networks will help us in understanding each layer of society s complexity .",
    "in this study , we analyzed the statistical properties of the bus routes of six indian cities , namely ahmedabad , chennai , delhi , hyderabad , kolkata and mumbai .",
    "our analysis suggests that the bus networks show a wide spectrum of topological structure from power - law to exponential , with varying magnitude of the power - law exponent @xmath44 .",
    "we also observe that these networks show small - world behaviour in terms of either the placement of the bus stops ( @xmath157-space ) or in terms of transfers ( @xmath152-space ) .",
    "for example , cbn and mbn do not show the small - world property in @xmath157-space .",
    "they , however , do show the small - world property in terms of transfers , as the majority of places can be visited by making as little as 2 to 3 bus changes .",
    "the redundancy in the network structure , as seen from the variation in @xmath20 and the presence of exponential cutoffs in the degree - distribution plots , validate our findings regarding the randomness associated with the growth and evolution of the bus networks with time .",
    "recently , wang et al .",
    "simulated exponential growth models for networks , with growth and adjacent node attachment as underlying processes .",
    "the growth equation according to their model is as follows : @xmath202 , where @xmath203 .",
    "the variable @xmath204 marks the vertices , and @xmath205 represents the probability that a vertex @xmath206 has a degree @xmath46 at time @xmath207 . the stationary degree distribution , @xmath208",
    "is given as @xmath209 .",
    "in the continuum limit , the above equation approaches the form @xmath210 , giving rise to the decay equation @xmath211 , with @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "our findings on the weak correlations between degree and centrality plots and self - similar structures of sub - networks motivate us to investigate the fractal nature of these networks .",
    "the degree - degree correlation matrix gives a rough idea on the degree - assortativity of these networks .",
    "strong assortativity in networks relate to strong connections between hubs , thus hubs tend to come in - between short - range connections .",
    "whereas , in disassortative mixing we observe hub - repulsion .",
    "the presence of hub - inter connectedness causes the characteristic path lengths of the networks to increase and also the fractal nature to diminish .",
    "presence of repelling hubs generate fractal topology in complex networks .",
    "an interesting aspect of the fractal topology is that they generate local small - worlds in well - defined communities . from a transportation perspective",
    ", it would be beneficial to have local small - worlds connected to a central core , as such a structure will reduce the characteristic path length and make the network efficient .",
    "the high values of characteristic path lengths for cbn and mbn can be attributed to the geographical structures of the two cities , chennai and mumbai .",
    "the routes in these two cities are exceptionally longer because the btns in these two cities have evolved more in a linear fashion .",
    "the reason for this may lie in the geographical limitation imposed by the presence of a water body on one side ( see figure 27 ) .",
    "also , most of our results on ahmedabad brts are inconclusive as the dataset is small . at present , the brts operates across only 13 routes with 129 bus stops .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to see the evolution of this network in future .    finally , we simulate si and sir dynamical processes on these networks in @xmath157-space . since experiments with epidemic outbreaks in a population ( or a network ) is not a viable option , we resort to mathematical modelling to understand diffusion of information and contagion spreading .",
    "we therefore study the effect of percolation and epidemic spreading on these networks using si and sir epidemic models through numerical simulations . while it is observed that the characteristic path length plays a crucial role in information diffusion and epidemic spreading , several other network metrics also play important roles .",
    "their importance is however restricted to their relative contribution to the topological structures of the networks .",
    "small - world property , while an extremely desirable property in transportation networks , is highly subjective in its role of information diffusion , solely due to the diffusing entity .",
    "finally , bus networks form a specific class of complex networks that grow and evolve over physically constrained spatial networks .",
    "interesting in this regard is the city of ahmedabad and the abn",
    ". statistical analysis of road networks ( by considering intersections as nodes and roads as links ) has shown that the topological structure of the road networks in the city of ahmedabad exhibits a scale - free degree distribution with @xmath213 and @xmath214 , which is very much similar to abn  @xcite .",
    "road intersections are usually separated by a distance which is geographically much smaller as compared to the distance between bus stops .",

    "<S> in recent times , the domain of network science has become extremely useful in understanding the underlying structure of various real - world networks and to answer non - trivial questions regarding them . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we rigourously analyze the statistical properties of the bus networks of six major indian cities as graphs in _ l_- and _ p_-space , using tools from network science . </S>",
    "<S> although public transport networks , such as airline and railway networks have been extensively studied , a comprehensive study on the structure and growth of bus networks is lacking . in india , where bus networks play an important role in day - to - day commutation , </S>",
    "<S> it is of significant interest to analyze their topological structure , and answer some of the basic questions on their evolution , growth , robustness and resiliency . </S>",
    "<S> we start from an empirical analysis of these networks , and determine their principle characteristics in terms of the complex network theory . </S>",
    "<S> the common features of small - world property and heavy tails in degree - distribution plots are observed in all the networks studied . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis further reveals a wide spectrum of network topologies arising due to an interplay between preferential and random attachment of nodes . unlike real - world networks , like the internet , www and airline , which are virtual , </S>",
    "<S> bus networks are physically constrained in two - dimensional space by the underlying road networks . in order to understand the role of constraints in the evolution of these networks , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate their fractal dimensions that reveal a three - dimensional space - like evolution in a constrained two - dimensional plane . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend our study to understand the complex dynamical processes of epidemic outbreaks and information diffusion in these networks using si and sir models . </S>",
    "<S> our findings , therefore throw light on the evolution and dynamics of such geographically and socio - economically constrained networks , which will help us in designing more efficient networks in the future . + * keywords * : complex networks , power - laws , self - similarity , small - world phenomenon , transportation networks </S>"
