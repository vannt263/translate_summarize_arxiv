    "in the preceding paper@xcite , a non - equilibrium path integral method for computing free energy differences based on combining the jarzynski equality@xcite and the crooks fluctuation relation@xcite with the path integral formulation of the quantum mechanical partition sum @xcite was presented .",
    "the path integral representation of the canonical partition function is based on mapping a quantum system at finite temperature onto a classical system with additional degrees of freedom .",
    "a non - equilibrium process can be carried out on this isomorphic classical system along a well - defined trajectory in fictitious time .",
    "the jarzynski and crooks relations are valid for such a process , but only under the assumption that the work distribution converges as the parameter @xmath0 of the regularization procedure applied to the infinite dimensional path integral goes to infinity .",
    "a regularization procedure is needed because particles are represented as objects with an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the path integral formulation . as a result ,",
    "non - equilibrium dynamical processes in this representation can lead to divergences in non - physical quantities , such as the average total hamiltonian of the particle or the work performed on the system in the fictitious process , which is a central quantity in the jarzynski and crooks relations .",
    "a regularization procedure restricts the number of degrees of freedom to a finite number @xmath0 and results in finite but @xmath0-dependent estimators for quantities of interest . in the regularized path",

    "the form of the difference between two diverging quantities is not unusual in the context of path integrals@xcite , but this does make it important to establish the convergence properties of all relevant estimators . furthermore , even when it can be demonstrated that the regularization procedure leads to convergent results , the viability of the non - equilibrium path integral method as a means of computing quantum free energy differences is strongly dependent on the rate of convergence of the regularized path integral to the exact quantum result . neither the convergence nor the rate of convergence was addressed in detail in ref .  , although strong numerical evidence of convergence was presented for a quantum particle in a quartic potential .    in this paper , the rate of convergence of different regularization procedures",
    "is examined in detail for the special case of a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "harmonic systems have the advantage of being often amenable to analytical treatment , allowing for closed form and exact solutions . here , the convergence of the regularization procedure is studied in three regimes of the non - equilibrium process , i.e. , the quasi - static , the finite time and instantaneous switching .",
    "the work distribution is computed for each of these regimes and its convergence , as well as the convergence of free energy difference are analyzed as the number of degrees of freedom goes to infinity .",
    "it will be shown that the free energy difference and the work distribution converge for both the fourier and the bead regularization procedures@xcite , with the latter converging more quickly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ system ] presents a brief overview of the method as it applies to the harmonic oscillator .",

    ".  [ quasistatic ] , [ finiteswitching ] and [ instantaneousswitching ] , the convergence of the non - equilibrium work distributions is analyzed for the cases of an infinitely slow switching rate , a finite switching rate and an instantaneous switching process , respectively .",
    "analytical considerations of the harmonic system proceed most easily in the fourier representation . as explained in ref .",
    ", the fourier transformation takes on slightly different forms in the fourier and the bead regularization methods . in both cases ,",
    "though , the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a cut - off wave vector , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 the dispersion relation for the fourier regularization is given by @xmath50 while that for the bead regularization is @xmath51 note that in the fourier regularization , @xmath47 is a chosen cut - off , whereas from the fourier transform of the bead regularization , we have @xmath52 or , for @xmath0 odd , @xmath53 .",

    "as well when the limit @xmath3 is evaluated , with correction terms of order @xmath69 ( see e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "there are other regularization methods possible which lead to even faster convergence of the free energy at the expense of a more complicated regularized hamiltonian .",
    "such higher - order schemes can be derived systematically by exploiting the analogy between the bead representation and the hamiltonian - splitting method used to obtain integrators in molecular dynamics .",
    "in fact , the basis of the bead regularization is the splitting form in eq .",
    "( 30 ) of the preceding paper@xcite , and that same form is also the basis of the verlet scheme to integrate the equations of motions for classical hamiltonian systems in molecular dynamics simulations@xcite .",
    "the advantage of using splitting schemes to derive integrators for molecular dynamics is that the approximate dynamics is still symplectic , causing such integration schemes to be very stable .",
    "the analogous property to symplecticity in the path integral context is the hermitian nature of the boltzmann operator , which is preserved in splitting schemes .    in an attempt to reduce the error due to operator splitting ,",
    "many alternative splitting schemes for molecular dynamics simulations have been derived ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "some of these schemes raise the order of the splitting approximation to @xmath70 or higher .",
    "such splitting schemes can also be used for path integrals and result in a fictitious hamiltonian in which the beads are not all equivalent or which contains explicit correction terms of order @xmath71 in the potential , and whose partition function converges to the real quantum partition sum as @xmath72 or higher .",
    "other splitting schemes derived for molecular dynamics simulations are aimed at reducing the error by minimizing the pre - factors in front of the leading correction terms@xcite .",
    "these methods , however , are based on the assumption that different correction terms contribute independently and equally to the error .",
    "this approach has proved useful in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "for instance , it has been demonstrated that an optimized second order scheme called hoa2 can often outperform the verlet scheme in molecular dynamics simulations of rigid water molecules@xcite .",
    "we will briefly consider the hoa2 operator - splitting scheme applied as a means to regularize imaginary - time path integrals , since it is the simplest splitting - method that may improve the rate of convergence of the regularization .",
    "it is based on the following operator - splitting scheme : @xmath73 for @xmath74 , this splitting scheme reduces to the path integral analog of the verlet scheme of molecular dynamics ( applied twice ) , which corresponds to the standard bead regularization procedure . however taking a different value of @xmath75 , namely @xmath76 , minimizes the sum of the squares of the error terms of @xmath77@xcite .",
    "it is shown in appendix [ appa ] that when applied to the dynamics of a classical harmonic oscillator , this scheme conserves energy better than the verlet scheme .",
    "the application of the hoa2 splitting scheme to path integrals is carried out by representing the boltzmann operator by @xmath0 factors of @xmath78 , taking its trace to get the partition function , using the splitting scheme for each factor , inserting completeness relations between each exponential , and performing the momentum integration .",
    "this procedure leads to a regularized path integral with hamiltonian @xmath79        + \\frac{1}{2m}\\left[w_1 u(u_n)+w_2u(v_n)\\right ] \\bigg\\}. \\label{pairh } \\ ] ] here , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the positions of the odd and the even beads , respectively . odd and",

    "gives rise to different potential strengths @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the partition sum @xmath89 is of gaussian form , since @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated in terms of the determinant of the matrix @xmath93 .",
    "for the verlet - like hamiltonian , a fourier transform could be used to diagonalize the matrix ( i.e. , to decouple the modes ) , which facilitates the determination of the eigenvalues and thus the determinant of @xmath93 . here",
    ", a fourier transform only yields a partial diagonalization , i.e. , defining @xmath94 ( where the factor @xmath95 and the shift in the phase in front of @xmath83 are introduced for convenience ) , one gets @xmath96 with @xmath97 since each term in the hamiltonian is simply a @xmath98 quadratic form , the partition sum can be written as a product of two - dimensional gaussian integrals , each of which is proportional to @xmath99 .",

    "the leading order correction is minimized by choosing @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 , which corresponds to the standard bead regularization procedure .",
    "other choices for @xmath75 lead to larger correction terms and hence slower convergence .",
    "we therefore conclude that using a different splitting scheme can be useful for path integrals if the order of the approximation is changed , but that optimized splitting methods need not yield any improvement , even if they have been shown to be beneficial in the context of molecular dynamics simulations .",

    "in fact it can be shown that for monotonically increasing @xmath9 , such as in eq .",
    ", @xmath233 and @xmath234 must always be positive , though this restriction need not hold for more complicated protocols .",
    "the complete work distribution function is therefore @xmath235 which unfortunately does not lead to a closed form , but can easily be computed numerically since @xmath236 and @xmath237 are known analytically . as an example , the resulting @xmath158 for the same parameters as for the quasi - static case is shown in fig .",

    "note that the intersection points occur at the same value of @xmath39 , as they must according to the crooks fluctuation relation . ]      to determine the convergence properties of the work distribution as @xmath3 , we will once again use the cumulants of the work . from the generating function in eq .",
    ", we have @xmath239 by expanding the logarithm and equating like powers of @xmath240 for @xmath241 , one finds the cumulants of the different modes to be @xmath242 one thus has for the cumulants of the total work @xmath243 this is of similar form to the expression for the work cumulants in the quasi - static process , which could be shown to converge because of the asymptotic property of @xmath133 as @xmath244 in eq .  .",
    "a similar asymptotic property here has to involve the two eigenvalues @xmath221 and @xmath222 of the real symmetric @xmath98 matrix @xmath245 for large @xmath56 .",
    "this asymptotic analysis starts with the behavior of the airy functions for large negative arguments@xcite    @xmath246    with corrections of relative @xmath247 . using these asymptotic expressions ,",
    "one can write for the mapping matrix needed in eq .   @xmath248 with @xmath249 and @xmath250 . substituting this @xmath251 into eq .   for @xmath252 using @xmath253 in @xmath254 , and substituting the result into expression for @xmath245 , yields @xmath255",
    "thus it is clear that asymptotically , both eigenvalues of @xmath245 are equal to @xmath256 .",
    "but @xmath257 is precisely equal to @xmath258 , so that eq .",
    "gives @xmath259 which precisely coincides with the asymptotic expression of the cumulants of mode @xmath56 in the quasi - static case , eq .  .",
    "in retrospect , this is not too surprising : higher @xmath56 modes have higher frequencies @xmath126 , so that the relative switching speed @xmath260 decreases for increasing @xmath56 , resulting in a quasi - static behavior for the work distributions of the high-@xmath56 modes .",
    "since the behavior of the work cumulants for large @xmath56 is the same as in the quasi - static switching , the cumulants themselves converge for the finite switching speed as well , and in exactly the same way , i.e. , @xmath261 in the fourier regularization and @xmath262 for the bead regularization .",
    "however it should be stressed that the correspondence between the quasi - static and finite - switching case only holds for the large @xmath56 modes , and that the lower @xmath56 modes do differ between the two cases and the total work distribution can vary substantially depending on the switching speed .      with these results for the generating function",
    ", the jarzynski equality can be once more checked .",
    "setting @xmath263 in eq .  , the generating function gives @xmath264 where the fact that @xmath265 has been used .",
    "putting together all the contributions to @xmath266 , one obtains the same expression as for the quasi - static case , eq .  .",
    "the subsequent calculation therefore applies , showing that the jarzynski relation , eq .",
    ", in the form of eq .  , also holds for finite switching rates .    the result in eq .",
    "holds not only for any @xmath22 using the protocol in eq .  ,",
    "but in fact for _ any protocol_. a different hamiltonian dynamics would only change the linear mapping @xmath251 , which would still obey @xmath267 , since this follows purely from the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics .",
    "thus , eq .   would still hold , from which the jarzynski relation follows .",
    "while the work distribution for finite @xmath22 could only be expressed analytically up to a convolution , for @xmath268 , it is possible to derive a fully analytical form . in this instantaneous limit ,",
    "the system does not have time to change its positions or momenta , whence @xmath269 .",
    "this allows the generating function @xmath213 to be computed , leading to @xmath270 the generating function can be inverted , to yield @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 is the complex error function .",
    "this work distribution @xmath158 has also been plotted in fig .",
    "[ tau - dependence ] , for the same parameters as for the quasi - static and finite-@xmath22 cases and both for the forward and reverse process .",
    "one sees that regardless of the speed of the process , the crossing points @xmath274 of the forward and reverse distributions are all the same , and equal to the free energy difference .    to check the convergence of the jarzynski equality in the instantaneous switching case , one substitutes @xmath275 into eq .  .",
    "for each of the modes , the generating function at @xmath275 coincides with the result for the finite switching speed , i.e.  the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "as a result , the convergence of the free energy as computed from the jarzynski equality in the instantaneous case is the same as it was for the finite switching case , as would be expected since the former is the @xmath276 limit of the latter .",
    "the convergence of the work distribution might be expected to follow similarly by taking the limit @xmath276 of the cumulants found in the case of finite switching , but it turns out that the limits @xmath276 and @xmath244 do not commute .",
    "the physical reason is that no matter how fast the finite switching is , for fixed positive definite @xmath22 and growing @xmath56 , there are always @xmath56 modes whose frequencies @xmath126 are faster than the switching rate @xmath277 , and for those modes the switching is nearly quasi - static .",
    "but if @xmath268 , then the process is instantaneous for all modes , regardless of their @xmath56 value .    to see the noncommutativity of the limits mathematically ,",
    "note that for instantaneous process in which the positions and momenta of the system do not have time to change , the @xmath251 matrix is equal to the identity matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath223 defined in eq .   then assumes the form @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "this form is not the same as the @xmath276 limit of eq .  .",
    "from eqs .   and , one finds for the mode cumulants in the instantaneous switching case @xmath281 where eq .   was used . for large @xmath56 , @xmath282 , so that @xmath283 in this regime . apart from a @xmath56 independent prefactor ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants as a function of @xmath56 is the same as in the previous cases , so that the convergence of the work distribution is also the same .",
    "the viability of the non - equilibrium path - integral approach for the computation of quantum free energy differences is made possible by the use of a fictitious dynamic , thus avoiding the problems associated with the description of the real time quantum evolution of the system , in contrast to other extensions of the jarzynski and crooks fluctuation relations to the realm of quantum mechanics , based on the operator formulation of quantum dynamics@xcite .",
    "to @xmath150 in a time @xmath238 , starting in canonical equilibrium with inverse temperature @xmath284 , for quantum , classical , and and fictitious dynamics.[comparison ] ]    as a consequence , however , the work computed within this scheme bears no relation to the work performed in any real quantum process except in the classical limit @xmath285 , where there are no contributions to the work distribution from the non - zero @xmath56 modes in the fictitious dynamics . the work distribution for an isolated quantum system in which the frequency is changed in real ( rather than fictitious ) time has recently been worked out by deffner and lutz@xcite , so that a direct comparison between the fictitious dynamics and real quantum dynamics is possible .",
    "the work distribution for the quantum harmonic oscillator consists of a sum of delta functions , since the real quantum work distribution can be obtained by summing over all possible transitions with the appropriate transition amplitudes worked out by husimi@xcite .",
    "thus , for the purpose of comparison , it is better to consider the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath286@xcite . figure  [ comparison ] shows the comparison between the classical cdf [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , the quantum cdf ( using husimi s transition amplitudes ) and the cdf resulting from the fictitious path dynamics [ cf .  eqs .   ] for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath238 and @xmath284",
    "the three curves are obviously very different .",
    "the quantum distribution is composed of steps , while the other two are continuous .",
    "the quantum distribution also does not agree with the fictitious dynamics on average .",
    "interestingly , the deviation of the real quantum dynamics from the classical case is less then the deviation from the fictitious dynamics .",
    "another difference between the real quantum dynamics and the dynamics in the other cases is the non - zero probability of negative work values predicted by the distribution , which , as suggested in ref .  , is due to excited states decaying to lower states .",
    "this negative tail disappears in the classical limit for the monotonic protocol in eq .  .",
    "the negative tails in the classical limit found in ref .   can only exist for non - monotonic protocols .",
    "given these observations , it is clear that the fictitious dynamics is very different from real quantum dynamics and has little direct physical content .",
    "the non - equilibrium methods for the calculation of free energy differences in quantum systems in the context of the path integral representation of the canonical partition function presented in the previous paper were applied to the harmonic oscillator to show that the work distribution function is well - defined as the regularization parameter @xmath0 is taken to infinity . instead of using the real quantum dynamics of the system , the path integral representation",
    "allows a fictitious path to be defined for which the jarzynski and crooks relations are valid . by evolving the ring polymer in the path integral representation under fictitious dynamics , the difficulties associated with the complexity of the full evolution of a quantum system are avoided .    in particular , expressions for the distribution @xmath158 of the work @xmath39 done in the non - equilibrium fictitious process in which the strength changes linearly during a time @xmath22 ,",
    "were derived , in the form of a single convolution for finite @xmath22 , and in fully explicit form for @xmath276 ( the instantaneous limit ) and @xmath287 ( the quasi - static limit ) . from @xmath158",
    ", it was shown that the jarzynski relation holds for this case for any dynamic switching process based on ( isolated ) hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the convergence of the resulting free energy difference was obtained for both regularizations , and goes as @xmath288 for the fourier regularization and as @xmath289 for the bead regularization .",
    "the nature of the convergence of the cumulants of @xmath158 as @xmath3 was also determined for any @xmath22 .",
    "whereas the beads regularization leads to cumulants which all converge as @xmath69 , the @xmath290th cumulant converges as @xmath291 in the fourier representation , implying that the shape of the distribution converges faster than its position along the @xmath39 axis .",
    "however , one can use perturbative arguments with the harmonic oscillator as the zeroth order system to show that the work distributions in the fourier and bead regularization converge as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "indeed , in the path integral simulations using the bead regularization presented in the preceding paper@xcite , one sees a @xmath2 convergence for the free energy difference as well as for the first and second cumulant of the work distribution function .",
    "given the analytical proof given in this paper and the numerical evidence in the preceding paper , it can be expected that the convergence of the method is general .",
    "other regularization schemes based on the splitting method were also briefly considered and it was found that splitting schemes optimized for molecular dynamics need not be optimal for the convergence of path integrals , in contrast to higher order splitting schemes which will have better asymptotic convergence properties .",
    "the difference between the fictitious dynamics and real quantum dynamics was demonstrated by direct comparison of the work distribution . not only is the nature of the distribution different ( delta peaks for",
    "the quantum case , a smooth function for the fictitious dynamics ) , but the two also do not agree on average . nonetheless , the free energy found from the non - equilibrium method with fictitious dynamics is the exact quantum free energy  difference .",
