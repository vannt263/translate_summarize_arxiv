    "there are many useful ways of indexing the complexity of knot types : crossing number , bridge number , tunnel number , genus , etc .",
    "often the relationship between these indices is unclear , and sometimes it is clear that there is no relationship .",
    "thus , for example , tunnel number one knots may be of arbitrarily high genus ( e. g. torus knots ) and genus number one knots may be of arbitarily high tunnel number ( e. g. doubles of complicated knots . ) given two indices of complexity it s natural to ask a sort of complementary question : how unusual is it for a knot ( other than the unknot ) to be of minimal complexity with respect to both indices ?",
    "for example , how rare is it that a knot have both genus one and tunnel number one ?    it s easy to construct examples of knots of this type .",
    "plumb together two twisted unknotted annuli .",
    "the boundary is typically knotted and the union of the annuli is visibly a genus one seifert surface . if we imagine hanging the union of annuli from a single peg we see that its boundary is naturally a @xmath0-bridge knot and therefore has tunnel number one .",
    "see figure [ fig:2bridge ] .",
    "it is known that these are the only @xmath0-bridge knots of genus one ( cf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 12.25 ) ) .        are there other examples of genus one tunnel number one knots ?",
    "morimoto and sakuma @xcite and independently eudave - muoz @xcite classified satellite knots which have tunnel number one .",
    "they have a concrete description and can be naturally indexed by a @xmath1-tuple of integers",
    ". in @xcite , goda and teragaito determined which of these satellite knots have genus one and made the conjecture that these knots complete the list of knots that have both genus one and tunnel number one .",
    "the conjecture was confirmed by matsuda @xcite for any knot that admits a @xmath2 decomposition ; that is , for any knot which is @xmath3-bridge on an unknotted torus .    the central objective of this paper is to prove the goda - teragaito conjecture in complete generality .",
    "the strategy will be to use thin position to show that any tunnel for a genus one knot can either be isotoped to lie on a genus one seifert surface , or isotoped to form an unknotted loop . in the latter case",
    ", it is shown that the knot admits a @xmath2 decomposition and matsuda s argument applies . in the former case",
    ", it follows from work of eudave - muoz and uchida @xcite that @xmath4 is a @xmath0-bridge knot .",
    "in retrospect , @xcite and @xcite can be viewed as the first two steps of the program . in @xcite",
    "we show how thin position can be used to understand unknotting tunnels for unknotting number one knots .",
    "in particular , we show that if @xmath4 and then @xmath5 are put in the thinnest possible position , then @xmath5 is level .",
    "if @xmath5 is a loop , then matsuda s theorem applies .",
    "otherwise , we show in @xcite , either @xmath4 is @xmath0-bridge or there is a well - defined invariant @xmath6 which , unless it is @xmath3 , ensures that the tunnel can be moved onto a minimal genus seifert surface .",
    "so all that remains is to consider the case in which @xmath7 , which we do here .    in the case",
    "that @xmath8 and the tunnel @xmath9 is not an unknotted loop , it will be shown that there is another useful way of describing @xmath4 on the boundary of the genus @xmath0 handlebody @xmath10 .",
    "that is , there is a different spine for @xmath11 , namely a @xmath12 curve @xmath13 , with these properties :    * the graph @xmath13 can be put in general position in @xmath14 in such a way that @xmath15 remains in thin position .",
    "* @xmath4 intersects each meridian of each edge of @xmath13 always with the same orientation .",
    "* @xmath16 is thinner than the graph @xmath17 . *",
    "a minimal genus seifert surface @xmath18 for @xmath19 intersects @xmath11 only in @xmath20 .",
    "a combinatorial argument will show that if @xmath4 intersects each meridian more than once then @xmath21 . assuming that @xmath22 and @xmath9 can not be isotoped to @xmath18 , the program",
    "then will be to find the thinnest spine satisfying the conditions above ( plus a more technical condition called the `` wave condition '' ) .",
    "for such a graph we know that @xmath4 intersects one of the meridians in only one point .",
    "we will argue , via thin position , that the cycle obtained by deleting this meridian is unknotted .",
    "it will follow that @xmath4 has a @xmath23 decomposition , so matsuda s result applies .",

    "notice that the condition on meridians of edges of @xmath13 can be interpreted as follows : @xmath4 and each edge of @xmath13 can be oriented so that @xmath4 always runs along a given edge in the direction consistent with that edge s orientation . in particular",
    ", @xmath4 intersects these meridians algebraically as well as geometrically in some @xmath25 points . with this in mind",

    "choose a segment @xmath45 that projects to a simple closed curve in the torus @xmath46 .",
    "then the order in which @xmath45 intersects respectively lines of the form @xmath47 is the order in which @xmath4 intersects respectively the meridians @xmath48 .",
    "this has the useful corollary :    [ cor : ziesch ] suppose @xmath4 is presented on @xmath13 as a @xmath24 quasi - cable , with @xmath49 .",
    "then there are at least two arcs of @xmath50 that are oriented from @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( and of course two then oriented from @xmath52 to @xmath51 ) .    since @xmath53 the corresponding arc @xmath54 crosses at least two vertical lines @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath39 , in between such crossings @xmath45 must cross at least one horizontal line @xmath56 .    in order to appreciate the point of definition",
    "[ defin : pq ] it s useful to observe that any pair @xmath57 can be presented as a @xmath36 quasi - cable for any relatively prime non - negative pair @xmath24 .",
    "consider the following construction .",
