    "last years majorana fermions attract a great attention in solid state physics .",
    "firstly predicted by e. majorana as a fermion particle that coincides with its own antiparticle , majorana fermions reappeared in condensed matter in the form of majorana bound states ( mbs)-spinless zero - energy subgap edge states in topological superconductors ( see e.g.[@xcite ] or review [ @xcite ] ) , useful for fault - tolerant quantum computation [ @xcite ] . by definition creation and annihilation",
    "operators of mbs coincide , @xmath0 .",
    "being a `` half '' of a dirac fermion ( its hermitian and anti - hermitian parts ) , majorana fermions obey a clifford algebra , @xmath1 .",
    "two mbs localized on the opposite sides of topological superconductor form a highly nonlocal dirac fermion , @xmath2 .",
    "this nonlocality leads to unusual electron transport through majorana bound states .",
    "in particular , electron tunneling in majorana systems could be very different from resonant level electron tunneling even in the case when majorana hybridization @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is majorana splitting energy ) is taken into account and mbs are splitted into two fermion levels .",
    "the presence of substrate superconductor introduces additional ( andreev ) channel of electron tunneling and supports electron hole symmetry .",
    "both those properties result in electron tunneling through mbs which strongly differs from ordinary resonant electron tunneling described by breit - wigner transmission probability .",
    "many efforts were spent to theoretically treat these topological modes and distinguish them from `` ordinary '' excitations in experiment which could mimic the properties of mbs ( see e.g.review [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "a promising venue in experimental observation of majorana fermion is the tunneling experiments where electrons tunnel through mbs which provides the only possible channel for a subgap electrical current at low bias voltages .",
    "it is already known that majorana fermions lead to a new transport phenomena - resonant andreev reflection which manifested in zero bias peak in differential conductance for normal metal / topological superconductor junction [ @xcite ] .",
    "although various properties of electron tunnel transport through majorana bound states have been already studied for two - terminal [ @xcite@xcite ] and three - terminal [ @xcite@xcite@xcite ] devices , we can add to this knowledge new results concerning specific properties of asymmetric majorana tunnel junction with strongly different coupling strengths to the normal metal leads .",
    "for this reasons we consider experimental setup ( see fig.1 ) where an electrically grounded nanowire ( i.e. 1d wire on top of s - wave superconductor ) is tunnelly coupled to a fixed normal metal electrode ( l - electrode ) and to a movable tip of scanning microscope ( r - electrode ) . in real experiment majorana bound states are supposed to be hosted at the ends of semiconducting wire on a top of ordinary s - wave superconductor when proximity effect , strong spin - orbit interaction and external magnetic field work together to form effectively spinless regime of electron transport deep inside the superconducting gap .",
    "our purpose here is to study transmission properties of topological superconductor with two majorana modes weakly coupled to the normal metal leads . for electrically grounded superconductor",
    "the currents through left ( l ) and right ( r ) tunnel contacts in the general case of asymmetric junction ( @xmath5 are the coupling energies ) are different even for equal biases @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the superconducting gap ) .",
    "each current depends both on @xmath8 and @xmath9 if majorana splitting energy @xmath10 . for this junction",
    "the linear conductances @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 ) at low temperatures and @xmath13 reach maximum value @xmath14 , exhibiting zero - bias anomaly in the differential conductance ( factor @xmath15 is due to the contribution of andreev tunneling ) just like when @xmath16 ( see ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) . for @xmath10",
    "linear conductances are always finite @xmath17 when both coupling energies @xmath18 are finite . in the limit @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath10 the linear conductance vanishes , @xmath19 .",
    "we show that for strongly asymmetric junction @xmath20 and for finite majorana energy splitting @xmath4 in the range @xmath21 the presence of the second mbs at the right end of the majorana nanowire coupled to the unbiased r - electrode restores zero - bias anomaly in the differential conductance of the left contact .",
    "in the transport regime when majorana nanowire is electrically isolated it is shown that electron current through a strongly asymmetric majorana junction qualitatively differs from the analogous current through breit - wigner resonant level .    .",
    "electrical potentials of the leads @xmath22 are counted from the electrical potential @xmath23 of the electrically grounded topological superconductor . ]",
    "at first we calculate electric currents at three terminal system consisted of two metal leads and an electrically grounded majorana nanowire .",
    "the full hamiltonian is given by three terms @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of normal leads with @xmath26 being the electron annihilation ( creation ) operator for the @xmath27 lead ( l or r ) , quantum wire with majorana edge states is described by effective low energy hamiltonian @xmath28 which follows from kitaev toy model [ @xcite ] , here @xmath29 is the splitting between two zero - energy states ( @xmath30 is the length of the majorana quantum wire and @xmath31 is the superconducting coherence length ) , and @xmath32 is the tunnel hamiltonian .    the tunnel hamiltonian describing coupling between @xmath33 lead and topological superconductor is @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the effective amplitude of tunneling which appears due to projection of superconductor electron - field operator onto the manifold of majorana states , thus tunnel couplings are characterized by energy level width @xmath37 ( see [ @xcite @xcite ] ) .",
    "the current operator in the @xmath27 lead reads ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39    by solving the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath40 one finds @xmath41    then after substitution it into heisenberg equation for majorana operators @xmath42\\ ] ] we obtain matrix equation for them @xmath43 where @xmath44",

    "the average current @xmath50 reads @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the temperature , @xmath53 is the electric potential counted from the fermi energy and the transmission coefficient @xmath54 takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56",
    "differential conductance in the low temperature limit for each equally biased lead reads ( restoring @xmath57 ) @xmath58 and when @xmath59 it becomes @xmath60 .",
    "we see that @xmath61 for arbitrary tunneling rates @xmath8 and @xmath9 as it should be when the leads are not biased with respect to the ground .",
    "notice the appearance for spinless electrons an extra overall factor @xmath15 in eq.([conductance ] ) and hyperbolic tangent in the current dependence on temperature and chemical potential instead of difference of fermi distribution functions in the ordinary situation ( landauer - buttiker formula ) .",
    "both these features are related to the presence of the substrate superconductor in electron transport through majorana quantum wire .",
    "factor @xmath15 is due to appearance of addition channel ( andreev tunneling ) in electron transport through mbs .",
    "characteristic temperature and chemical potential dependence in eq.([current ] ) is usual for normal metal - superconductor ( ms ) junctions . in the limiting case of a single ms contact ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) our formulae for current and conductance",
    "are reduced to the corresponding expression in ref.[@xcite ] . in general case of asymmetric junction ( @xmath64 )",
    "the currents in the left and right contacts are not equal , @xmath65 ( see also ref.[@xcite ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the limit when the total current to the ground vanishes , @xmath66",

    "we reproduce the expression for the current @xmath68 through a symmetric majorana nanowire derived also in ref.[@xcite @xcite ] . for asymmetric junction and/or asymmetric bias @xmath69 the total current to the ground",
    "@xmath70 is not zero .",

    "it means that zero - bias majorana signature @xmath85 disappears in a single contact junction if majorana energy splitting @xmath86 .",
    "zero - bias peak is re - established for strongly asymmetric double contact junction @xmath87 and @xmath81 when the total width of splitted majorana levels exceeds the level splitting . in general",
    "the presence of even unbiased second contact enhances the current at low energies ( temperature , bias voltage ) .     as a function of bias voltage normalized by the total width @xmath88 .",
    "( i ) solid curve demonstrates the zero - bias anomaly ( @xmath89 , stm tip is moved to infinity , @xmath90 ) ( ii ) dotted curve corresponds to the case of strong splitting energy @xmath91 .",
    "majorana signature @xmath92 disappears and conductance peak shifts to nonzero voltages .",
    "when the second contact ( right ) with high transparency @xmath87 is introduced one can observe majorana signature again , line for current dependence in this case coincides with solid line .",
    "b ) current - voltage characteristics of electrically isolated strongly asymmetric majorana nanowire @xmath93 . in strongly asymmetric system ( @xmath94 ) without level splitting ( @xmath90 ) , the current saturates at voltages of order of the smallest tunnel width @xmath9 , in contrast to conventional resonant tunneling , thus this dependence is highly nonlinear . ]",
    "now we consider experimental setup when the superconductor which supports majorana nanowire is electrically isolated and the current through mbs is induced by the bias voltage @xmath95 . for a symmetric junction ( @xmath96 )",
    "this problem was studied in ref.[@xcite@xcite ] .",
    "we have seen already that for symmetric electrically grounded junction and for symmetrically biased leads @xmath97 ( only this case was considered in ref.[@xcite ] ) the total current to the ground @xmath66 .",
    "so the currents through left and right contacts are equal , @xmath98 . it does not matter whether superconductor is electrically grounded or not .",
    "this strategy can be applied also for asymmetric junction .",
    "now the equations @xmath99 determine electrical potentials @xmath100 of the leads as a function of bias voltage @xmath101 .",
    "it is evident that for small junction asymmetry @xmath102 the asymmetry in electrical potentials @xmath103 is small and weakly influences the current . in the opposite limit of strong junction asymmetry ( for definiteness we will assume @xmath94 )",
    "electrical potentials strongly differ , @xmath104 for all biases @xmath101 and the current through the electrically isolated majorana nanowire could be different comparing with the analogous current through resonant ( breit - wigner ) level .",
    "at first we consider low temperature limit @xmath105 and a sufficiently long nanowire ( @xmath106 ) thus majorana energy splitting can be neglected . in this case",
    "the problem can be easily solved analytically . when @xmath90 the transmission coefficient @xmath107 depends ( as it should be ) only on its coupling energy strength @xmath108 @xmath109 and",
    "the corresponding currents take a simple form @xmath110    for strongly asymmetric junction @xmath94 the solution of eq.([current_unbiased ] ) is @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) and the current through electrically isolated majorana nanowire is determined by the corresponding current through the weakest link @xmath113 according to eq.([current_asymmetric ] ) the current is saturated at @xmath114 to the value @xmath115 which coincides with corresponding maximum current through breit - wigner resonant level ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "however unlike usual transport where saturation occurs at @xmath116 ( for strongly asymmetric junction ) in our case the current reaches its maximum value at a much more lower energies @xmath117 ( see fig.2,b ) .",
    "now we consider the influence of finite majorana splitting @xmath4 on current voltage characteristics .",
    "our calculations show ( see fig.2,b ) that `` small '' values of splitting energy @xmath118 weakly influence @xmath119-@xmath101 curves evaluated for @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath4 is of the order of @xmath8 the saturation of current curves occurs at energy scale @xmath120 end this @xmath119-@xmath101 characteristic resembles the well - known @xmath121-dependence for electron tunnelling through an asymmetric single - level quantum dot .",
    "specific features of majorana tunneling disappear .",
    "one can see the characteristic properties of majorana tunneling also by analysing the temperature dependence of conductance @xmath122 .",
    "as it is well known ( see e.g. review [ @xcite ] ) the conductance at resonant tunneling at high temperatures scales as @xmath123 ( where @xmath124 ) and the crossover temperature from t - independent regime of transport to @xmath125 -scaling is determined by the total level width @xmath126 .",

    "in summary we calculated electrical current through majorana bound states for electrically grounded system end effectively electrically isolated majorana nanowire .",
    "our aim was to find specific features of electron tunneling in this system in the presence of finite majorana energy splitting @xmath4 wich suppresses zero - bias anomaly in differential conductance .",
    "we show that the fingerprints of majorana states can be easily revealed in tunneling experiments with strongly asymmetric majorana junction .",
    "we suggested experimental setup where the strenght of mbs coupling to the leads can be controlled with the help of scanning tunneling nicroscope ( stm ) . for three - terminal geometry ( electrically grounded majorana nanowire )",
    "it was shown that the presence of unbiased extra electrode strongly coupled to the nanowire increases electric current through majorana bound states at low bias voltages .",
    "in particular in the case when majorana energy splitting is in the range @xmath21 zero - bias anomaly in differential conductance which is suppressed for two - terminal device ( @xmath89 ) is restored when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath4 .",
    "unusual tunneling characteristics of majorana bound states ( mbs ) can be observed even in the limit of vanishingly small majorana energy splitting @xmath129 .",
    "it is known ( see e.g.[@xcite ] ) that in this case transmission coefficient of electron tunneling through mbs takes the form of breit - wigner resonant tunneling probability .",
    "therefore the presence in the system resonant levels at fermi - energy ( in particular , kondo resonance ) can mimic the properties of majorana fermions .",
    "we showed that the tunneling current through electrically ungrounded majorana nanowire ( two - terminal device ) with strongly different couplings to the leads is qualitatively distinct from the analogous current through resonant ( breit - wigner ) level .",
