    "solar filaments are elongated dark structures appearing on the solar disk typically observed in h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "they show similar , but more extended , dark features in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) lines or continuum @xcite .",
    "when they are seen above the solar limb they are called prominences , it is revealed that filaments are dense clouds suspended in the corona . while their temperature is @xmath1100 times smaller than that of the surrounding corona , their density is @xmath1100 times higher than the latter , leading to the total mass of a filament in the range of @xmath2@xmath3 g @xcite .",
    "the mass is so high that the mass of several quiescent filaments is comparable with the whole mass of the corona @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the mass of a filament can not be supplied by the condensation of the local corona itself @xcite .",
    "therefore , the filament material must originate from the chromosphere .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the chromosphere supplies the necessary mass into the supporting magnetic structure in the corona , either a flux rope or a sheared arcade . one popular mechanism is the evaporation - condensation model @xcite , i.e. , chromospheric plasmas are heated up to the coronal temperature and then evaporated into the corona along the magnetic field line . as the hot plasma accumulates , the coronal loop finally becomes so dense that the criterion for thermal instability is satisfied , and the coronal plasma cools down to @xmath110@xmath4 k in a catastrophic way @xcite .",
    "this model can explain the sudden appearance of many filaments , as illustrated by radiative hydrodynamic or hydromagnetic simulations in one dimension @xcite , two dimensions @xcite , and even three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the multiwavelength observations in euv confirmed the cooling process from @xmath11.5 mk all the way to 30,000 k in @xmath18 hr @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the cold chromospheric material can be directly injected into the corona along the magnetic field lines , as observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the injection may result from magnetic reconnection in the low atmosphere as magnetic elements with the minority polarity approach the dominant polarity @xcite .",
    "this model is also supported by accumulating observational evidence , which shows that the endpoints of a filament or its barbs correspond to mixed magnetic polarities , and cold jets flow toward the filament spine @xcite .",
    "it is noted , however , that the mixed polarities are not the only place where magnetic reconnection can happen . a more general case would be the magnetic quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) , where current sheets can be formed easily and reconnection can happen even when a single polarity is present on the photospheric magnetogram . in this _",
    ", with the combined high - resolution observations of the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( _ sdo _ ) and the 1.6 m new solar telescope ( nst , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , at big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) , we report that the thread clusters of an active - region filament are rooted along a bright ridge in h@xmath0 , which corresponds to the intersection of a magnetic qsl with the solar surface .",
    "the observations are described in  [ obs ] , and the results are presented in  [ res ] , which are followed by discussions in  [ dis ] .",
    "a small filament is located in the active region noaa 12403 ( s27e24 ) on 2015 august 21 , as shown by figure [ fig1](a ) , which is the h@xmath0 image from the global oscillation network group ( gong , * ? ? ?",
    "this filament was observed by the bbso / nst from 17:00 ut to 19:00 ut .",
    "its field of view ( fov ) covers only the western half of the filament , as indicated by the yellow box in figure [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( _ iris _ ; * ? ? ? * ) mission observed the eastern half of the filament , with both imaging in a wider fov and spectroscopy in a smaller fov as indicated by the blue solid and dashed boxes in figure [ fig1](b ) .    for observing the fine structures of the filament , the visible image spectrometer ( vis ) onboard nst , which uses a fabry - prot etalon with the bandpass of 0.07  , is required .",
    "it provides the h@xmath0 line - center , @xmath50.2  , @xmath50.4  , @xmath50.6  , @xmath50.8  , and @xmath51.0   filtergrams .",
    "the fov is about @xmath6 and the image resolution is @xmath7 per pixel and the cadence is 32 s. the photospheric motions can be observed by the broad filter imager ( bfi ) which uses a tio filter ( 7057  ) with a bandpass of 10  .",
    "its spatial resolution is @xmath8 per pixel and the cadence is 15 s.    the and spectra observed by _ iris _",
    "are used for spectral diagnostics of the filament .",

    " ) with the bandpass of 40  .",
    "both the slit - jaw images have a pixel size of @xmath10 .    in order to understand the magnetic environment and the underlying mechanism of the filament activity",
    ", we use the magnetograms observed by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "_ sdo_. the magnetograms have a resolution of @xmath11 per pixel and a cadence of 45 s. furthermore , magnetic extrapolation can help us determine more detail about the magnetic configuration .",
    "data from the space - weather hmi active region patches ( sharps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used .",
    "the sharps data have resolved the 180@xmath12 ambiguity by adopting the minimum energy method @xcite .",
    "the coordinate system has been modified by the lambert method @xcite , and the project effects are corrected with the method described by @xcite . in order to coalign the observed data from different telescopes , both the bbso / nst h@xmath0 line wing images and the slit - jaw images",
    "are compared with the continuum images observed by _ sdo_/hmi .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) displays a single snapshot of the h@xmath0 images at line center .",
    "it is clear that the filament is composed of many thin threads , terminating at the western endpoints of the filament .",
    "the attached animation shows that these threads are highly dynamic .",
    "new threads are formed continuously , and then move along the direction of the threads .",
    "a clear impression is that the upper part of the filament is dominated by rightward - moving threads , which drain down to the solar surface , whereas the lower part of the filament is associated with leftward - moving threads , which originate from the western endpoints of the filament . in order to see the dynamics more clearly",
    ", we select two slices , i.e. , yellow and blue slices , along the upper half and the lower half of the filament , respectively , as marked in figure [ fig2](a ) . for both slices ,",
    "the starting points are chosen to be the western endpoint of the filament .",
    "the time evolution of the intensity along the yellow and blue slices are plotted in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure [ fig2 ] , respectively . in order to show the flows clearly",
    ", the image of the h@xmath0 line wing is used .",
    "it is seen that along the yellow slice , most of the intensity patterns show a motion toward the starting point of the slice , as indicated by dashed lines in figure [ fig2](b ) . in contrast , the blue slice is associated with sporadic ejections moving away from the starting point , as indicated by dashed lines in figure [ fig2](c ) . according to the time - distance diagrams , we find that these flows are sporadic , with an interval of @xmath120 min .",
    "each time , the flow lasts for about 10 min .",
    "it is noted in figure [ fig3](a ) that all of the threads are rooted along a bright ridge in h@xmath0 .",
    "the ridge is not uniform in brightness , with some parts fainter than others .",
    "interestingly , the yellow slice corresponds to the threads rooted at the fainter part of the ridge , whereas the blue slice corresponds to the threads mapped to the brighter part . in order to understand the magnetic properties of this bright ridge , we superpose the h@xmath0 intensity contour lines of its brightest kernels on the _ sdo_/hmi magnetogram in figure [ fig3](c ) .",
    "apparently the bright ridge in h@xmath0 extends from the eastern edge of a positive sunspot all the way down to a region close to the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) between a negative polarity and a positive polarity further south .",
    "it is noted that the bright kernels have typical sizes of @xmath13 , which are comparable to the width of the filament threads .",
    "these fine structures can only be seen in high - resolution observations .    with the _",
    "sdo_/hmi sharps vector magnetograms , we extrapolate the nonlinear force - free coronal magnetic field by applying the optimization method @xcite .",
    "once the 3-dimensional coronal magnetic field is obtained , its topological parameters , e.g. , the squashing factor @xmath14 @xcite , can be calculated . as discussed by @xcite , the locations with extremely large @xmath14",
    "correspond to qsls , across which the magnetic connectivity changes drastically .",
    "the distribution of @xmath14 in the solar surface is plotted in figure [ fig3](d ) .",
    "comparing panels ( a ) and ( d ) , it is seen that the bright ridge in h@xmath0 is associated with large @xmath14 , meaning that the h@xmath0 bright ridge corresponds to the footpoint of a qsl .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig4 ] displays the _ iris _ slit - jaw image in k 2796  which covers the eastern part of the filament .",
    "because of its wide bandpass , the filament is nearly invisible .",
    "even though , it is seen that the eastern endpoints of the filament are also rooted at an area with continuing brightenings . a narrow region with @xmath15",
    "is measured by the _ iris _ spectrometer with the scanning mode .",
    "it takes @xmath1200 s to complete one raster .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) in figure [ fig4 ] display the dopplergrams at two times separated by @xmath11 hr .",
    "it is seen that blue shifts persist around the position ( -456 , -345 ) as indicated by the blue arrows , whereas red shifts persist around the position ( -448 , -345 ) as indicated by the red arrows .",
    "the blue shifts , i.e. , upflows , have typical velocities of @xmath1 5 km s@xmath16 , and the red shifts , i.e. , downflows , have typical velocities of @xmath1 10 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the non - linear force free field ( nlfff ) extrapolation of the filament magnetic configuration is given in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "on comparing with the magnetic field lines in figure [ fig5 ] with figure [ fig4 ] , it is revealed that the blue - shifted area is roughly cospatial with the pink field lines which are mapped to the yellow dashed line marked in figure [ fig2](a ) , whereas the red - shifted area is associated with the yellow field lines which are mapped to the blue dashed line in figure [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the doppler shift pattern is consistent with the extrapolated magnetic connectivity , i.e. , cold upflows are ejected at the eastern footpoints of the pink field lines in figure [ fig5 ] , and then move westward until draining down to the western footpoint of the pink field lines .",
    "in contrast , another stream of cold upflows is ejected at the western footpoints of the yellow field lines , and then move eastward until draining down to the eastern footpoints of the yellow field lines .",
    "it is well known that filament material should originate from the chromosphere .",
    "however , it has been debated whether the cold chromospheric material is ejected into the corona directly as claimed by the injection model @xcite , or is heated up to @xmath12 mk and evaporated to the corona where thermal instability leads to catastrophic cooling to @xmath110@xmath4 k , as claimed by the evaporation - condensation model @xcite . with the solid observations showing both direct injection @xcite and in - situ formation via thermal instability @xcite",
    ", it seems that both mechanisms are at work in the solar corona .    for the injection model",
    ", it has been proposed that the injected upflows are cold jets resulting from the magnetic reconnection in the solar lower atmosphere @xcite .",
    "one unclear issue regarding this model is how reconnection can drive cool material to a height of @xmath1100 mm in the corona without heating the plasma too much @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , when the reconnection point is located in the low chromosphere , most of the released magnetic energy goes to the kinetic energy of the reconnection outflow , and the plasma is heated weakly .",
    "furthermore , radiation and ionization consume a significant part of the thermal energy @xcite .",
    "these numerical simulations indicate that it is possible to have fast but cold jets from the chromosphere to the corona . for the evaporation - condensation model , however , the upper chromospheric plasma should be heated .",
    "although in most numerical models @xcite , a localized heating is specified in the chromosphere without mentioning which mechanism , it is perceivable that the heating is also due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "this means that both of the models for the filament formation require magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere , and canceling magnetic features have been discovered to be associated with the mass supply for filaments @xcite . with this _",
    "letter _ , we emphasize that the mixed polarities are not the only place which can host chromospheric magnetic reconnection and inject cold plasma to feed a filament . a more general scenario for the reconnection to happen is the magnetic qsl .",
    "at least for the active - region filament observed on 2015 august 21 , its endpoint is found to be rooted at a magnetic qsl , which is calculated from the extrapolated magnetic field and manifested by a bright ridge in h@xmath0 .",
    "our high - resolution observation reveals that the bright ridge consists of many small kernels with sizes comparable to the width of the filament threads .",
    "it implies that the mass supply of the filament threads may come from the bright kernels",
    ".    different formation mechanisms of solar filaments require different magnetic configurations . for",
    "the filaments described by the evaporation - condensation model , a magnetic dip is necessary for a flux tube , otherwise the condensed plasma can not be suspended in the corona , and would drain down to the solar surface along the field line upon formation . however , for the filaments formed via continuous chromospheric injection , they are maintained dynamically with quasi - continuous siphon flows as demonstrated by @xcite and the observations in this paper . in this case ,",
    "magnetic dips are not necessary .",
    "they may or may not exist in the solar corona .",
    "it seems that this kind of dynamically - sustained filaments may be of quiescent type @xcite or of active - region type ( this paper ) .",
    "a typical dynamic feature found in solar filaments is the counterstreaming @xcite .",
    "their nature has not yet been fully understood . in our viewpoint , the nature of counterstreamings is not independent of the formation mechanism and the magnetic configuration . in the case of the evaporation - condensation model ,",
    "the counterstreamings are probably due to the longitudinal oscillation of the filament threads @xcite , where a magnetic dip exists near the top of the magnetic field line . in the case of the chromospheric injection model , no longitudinal oscillations",
    "are needed , nor are the magnetic dips . in this case , the counterstreamings are the combination of unidirectional flows as implied by the spectroscopic observations @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the high - resolution h@xmath0 observations clearly support such a scenario , as revealed by figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it seems that the streaming is like a siphon flow , moving from the brighter ( hence with higher pressure ) footpoint to the weaker ( hence with lower pressure ) footpoint .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig2 ] , the counterstreaming pattern of this filament is very simple , with the upper half strand moving westward and the lower half strand moving eastward .",
