    "the entropy difference associated with the magnetic phase transition is only 0.78 rln2 , indicating that magnetic order does not develop from a well defined doublet ground state , alternatively an onset of the weak kondo effect with the kondo temperature t@xmath27@xmath200.5 k can account for a reduced entropy .",

    "although the site symmetry of yb in ybrh@xmath0pb is tetragonal and hence the cef scheme must consist of 4 doublets , we show that the first excited doublet lies sufficiently close to the ground state doublet that the ground state can be considered a quartet . in fig .",

    "the best fit to the broad maximum in the heat capacity at @xmath1228 k ( fig .",

    "dashed lines represent the schottky heat capacity c@xmath34 of the two - level system , when the levels are split by the magnetic field . ]    to further test this cef scheme we have measured c(t ) in a variety of fields between zero and 4 t. the data are presented in fig .",
    "magnetic fields suppress the heat capacity jump at the magnetic transition .",
    "the ordering temperature also decreases in field , and fig .",
    "8 indicates that a magnetic field @xmath354 t is required to completely suppress magnetic order . for fields greater than @xmath122 t ,",
    "the measured heat capacity mostly consists of a single broad peak which shifts to higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field .",
    "we attribute this peak to the zeeman splitting of the ground state of ybrh@xmath0pb , which is a quartet in zero field .",
    "the field dependence of the heat capacity represented in fig .",
    "7 can be understood by assuming that the quartet is zeeman split by the field into a ground state doublet and two excited singlets , as depicted in fig .",
    "6 . accordingly",
    ", in a field of 4 t , the heat capacity reaches @xmath122 j / mole@xmath36k at t@xmath37=0.448@xmath33=3.3 k as expected for a system with a thermally activated occupation levels with degeneracy ratio of 0.5  @xcite .",
    "the splitting @xmath33 between the ground doublet and first excited doublet is deduced from schottky fits to the data of fig .  7 , and @xmath33 is itself plotted in fig .",
    "we note that including a second excited singlet state to this analysis did not significantly improve the quality of the fits .",
    "@xmath33 increases approximately linearly to a value of 7 k in a field of 4 t. interestingly , fig .",
    "8 suggests that there is a residual splitting of @xmath12 1.5 k in zero field , which may perhaps account for the broad peak on which the magnetic anomaly is superposed ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "apart from this small splitting , the evolution of the heat capacity with magnetic fields indicates that the zero field ground state of ybrh@xmath0pb is fourfold degenerate",
    ". it would be interesting to further test this level scheme in ybrh@xmath0pb using inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "suppression of the magnetic ordering temperature t@xmath1 with increasing magnetic field ( @xmath28 ) ; @xmath38 indicates the zeeman splitting @xmath33 of the ground state quartet , taken from the schottky analysis of the heat capacity described in the text .",
    "solid lines are guides for the eye . ]    given the magnitudes of the splittings in the cef scheme of ybrh@xmath0pb which are revealed by our analysis of the heat capacity , we expect that the effective yb moment varies considerably over the temperature range 1.8 k - 300 k spanned by our measurements . as we have observed in our discussion of fig .",
    "3 , this implies that @xmath15 can not be fit by the curie - weiss law over an extensive range of temperatures .",
    "this is illustrated in the fig .",
    "9 , where we plotted the effective magnetic moment @xmath39 as a function of temperature . with increased temperature , @xmath18 increases as the excited states become occupied .",
    "however , the full yb@xmath13 hund s rule moment of 4.54 @xmath19 is not regained even at temperatures as large as 300 k.    the interplay between moment degeneracy and intermoment interactions strongly impacts the stability of magnetic order in ybrh@xmath0pb , which only occurs below 0.57 k. while neutron diffraction measurements would be required to unambiguously establish the type of magnetic order , the relatively weak field dependence of the transition temperature and the absence of appreciable broadening of the transition in the heat capacity suggest that ybrh@xmath0pb is an antiferromagnet .",
    "magnetic order arises within a ground state quartet , which is further split into a doublet separated from the first of two excited singlets by @xmath12 1.5 k. increasing this separation @xmath33 with magnetic field results in the further suppression of the ordering temperature t@xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the successive actions of tetragonal and uniaxial cef effects results in a paramagnetic state with a moment much reduced from the free ion value . at the same time , the small residual resistivity and the small electronic heat capacity suggest extremely weak hybridization between the yb moment and the conduction electrons , and subsequently a small rkky interaction among yb moments . for these reasons",
    ", we believe that magnetic order in ybrh@xmath0pb is driven by a vanishingly small rkky interaction acting on moments which have been reduced to a minimal value by cef splittings which , while small in an absolute sense , are very large compared to t@xmath1 itself .",
    "the temperature dependent effective magnetic moment @xmath40 vs t. ]",
    "we have synthesized the novel intermetallic heusler compound ybrh@xmath0pb , which orders magnetically below t@xmath1=0.57 k. the electrical resistivity displays an unusual linear temperature dependence , and its small residual value is consistent with good crystalline quality",
    ". analyses of the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility indicate that the cef splits the eight - fold degenerate ground state of yb@xmath13 into a ground state quartet and two excited doublets separated from the ground state by 68 k and 300 k , respectively .",
    "magnetic fields further split the ground state , and we propose that this reduction in the effective moment is responsible for the observed reduction in the ordering temperature . given the strong current interest in the quantum critical behavior which is found near phase transitions which occur at low or zero temperatures  @xcite , it is interesting to consider whether ybrh@xmath0pb belongs to this class of materials . while ybrh@xmath0pb orders at a very low temperature , one which can be reduced still further by applying a magnetic field , it is unlikely that quantum critical behavior will be observable in this system .",
    "the purely local moment nature of the magnetism , paired with the absence of correlation effects among the conduction electrons suggest that ybrh@xmath0pb belongs instead to the weak coupling limit of the doniach phase diagram  @xcite . without a large magnetic energy scale ,",
    "the conventional critical phenomena associated with the small but finite temperature magnetic phase transition will limit any non - fermi liquid behavior in ybrh@xmath0pb to very small reduced temperatures  @xcite .",
