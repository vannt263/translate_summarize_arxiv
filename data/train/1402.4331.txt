    "understanding and mapping of the brain connectivity is one of the most challenging problems of neuroscience @xcite .",
    "the information provided by the matrix of interconnections of the human brain , or `` connectome '' @xcite , is essential for both basic and applied neurobiological research .",
    "it is believed that numerous severe disorders like parkinson s and huntington s diseases , autism , schizophrenia , and dyslexia are related to disorders in brain connectivity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a particular important problem is to reveal connectivity , and especially _ directional connectivity _ , from multivariate data , e.g. from multichannel electroencephalography ( eeg ) or magnetoencephalography ( meg ) measurements @xcite .",
    "another , but related , problem is to find out whether two correlated nodes are connected directly or indirectly . in a more general context",
    ", the problem of revealing connectivity can be formulated as a general data analysis problem for oscillator networks : how to recognize the network structure , i.e. the directions and the strengths of the couplings , from the observation . in particular , similar tasks arise also in the analysis of other physiological systems , e.g. in quantification of cardio - respiratory interaction @xcite and in a number of other fields , e.g. in climate physics @xcite and ecology @xcite .",
    "various techniques , mostly based on different measures of correlation @xcite , synchronization @xcite , and mutual or transfer information @xcite have been exploited to tackle the connectivity problem .",
    "a separate group of methods relies on the coupled oscillator theory ; these techniques assume that the nodes of the network are active , self - sustained , oscillators and reveal directional connectivity by reconstructing the phase dynamics @xcite via analysis of instantaneous phases and instantaneous frequencies . in this paper",
    "we further develop the phase dynamics approach , by substituting the pairwise analysis of a network by an analysis of triplets of nodes .",
    "we show that this essentially improves the reliability of the method .",
    "although motivated by the problems of neuroscience , the technique can be exploited to recover the structure of networks of various nature .",
    "before proceeding with the presentation of the technique we discuss different notions of connectivity . in neuroscience one",
    "typically differentiates between anatomical connections , functional connections , corresponding to correlations between pairs of nodes which may be not connected anatomically , and effective connections , representing direct or indirect causal influences of one node on the other @xcite .",
    "we illustrate these important notions by the following example .",
    "suppose we have three self - sustained oscillators , coupled as shown in fig .",
    "[ connillustr]a . here",
    "the arrows indicate physically existing , uni- or bidirectional , connections . for physical systems these connections",
    "are implemented by means of resistors , optical fibers , etc . for biological systems they correspond to anatomical connections , e.g. via synapses or via white matter tracts between pairs of brain regions",
    "mathematically , this means that , e.g. , for the second node we can write @xmath0 where the vectors @xmath1 are state variables of the @xmath2th oscillator , functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe the autonomous dynamics and the coupling , respectively ; the coupling parameter @xmath5 explicitly quantifies the strength of interaction . since the dynamics of the second oscillator depends on the state of the first one , we say that there is a _ structural connection _",
    "obviously , the structural connectivity is directional .     and",
    "@xmath7 are physically ( structurally ) connected .",
    "this connection can be bi- or unidirectional , as shown by arrows .",
    "( b ) structural connection causes correlated ( or synchronous ) dynamics , i.e. functional connection ( dotted lines ) . since measures of correlation and synchronization",
    "are symmetric , functional connectivity is not directional .",
    "notice that although nodes @xmath8 are not physically connected , they may be correlated due to the common drive from the node @xmath9 and indirect action of node @xmath10 , which yields an additional link if compared with ( a ) .",
    "( c ) if there is a directional structural link @xmath11 , then phase dynamics of node @xmath12 depends on the node @xmath2 , i.e. the same link exists in the effective phase connectivity map .",
    "however , additional links may appear .",
    "so , for this example , phase dynamics of node @xmath13 may depend on that of node @xmath10 , i.e. these nodes may be also effectively connected ( dotted line ) .",
    "notice that phase connectivity is also directional .",
    "so , e.g. , the @xmath14 effective phase connection is possible in this configuration , while the @xmath15 connection is not . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    next , consider two physically uncoupled nodes @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "since node @xmath10 acts indirectly on the node @xmath13 via the node @xmath9 and both nodes @xmath8 have a common drive , they can synchronize or , more generally , can oscillate with a certain degree of correlation .",
    "a measure of correlation or synchrony would reflect the non - directional functional connectivity ( fig .",
    "[ connillustr]b ) .",
    "synchrony is typically quantified by means of the synchronization index , also known as the phase locking value , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since it is computed from the phases of interacting units , see eq .",
    "( [ sind2 ] ) below , it quantifies functional phase connectivity .",
    "now we discuss the notion of _ effective phase connectivity _ , crucial for our approach . for this purpose",
    "we recall , that if the coupling between the nodes is weak then the dynamics of @xmath16 coupled systems can be reduced to that of @xmath16 phases .",
    "it means that each oscillator , which can be a high - dimensional dynamical system , can be characterized by a single variable , the phase @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this variable is introduced in such a way , that it grows uniformly in time , i.e. @xmath18 the weakness of coupling means that the motion in the state space takes place on the smooth invariant @xmath16-dimensional torus .",
    "the equations of the phase dynamics are : @xmath19 where the new phase coupling functions @xmath20 can be obtained from the state space coupling functions @xmath21 by means of a perturbative reduction @xcite in the form of the power series in the coupling parameter @xmath5 : @xmath22 if the coupling function @xmath20 depends on @xmath23 , we say that there exist a directed phase connectivity link @xmath24 .",
    "the crucial issue is that even if the structural connections are pairwise , i.e. @xmath25 the phase coupling functions @xmath20 can have terms , _ depending on many phases , not only on the phases of directly coupled nodes _ @xcite .",
    "so , for the example illustrated in fig .",
    "[ connillustr]a , the equation of the phase dynamics for the third node has the form @xmath26 notice , that the indirect coupling @xmath27 is reflected by the term @xmath28 ; hence , for a very weak coupling the indirect link @xmath14 is negligible and the effective phase connectivity coincides with the structural one .",
    "however , for not very small @xmath5 , the indirect coupling @xmath14 becomes not small either .",
    "notice , that the indirect coupling @xmath29 is not possible , since there is no information flow from node @xmath13 to node @xmath9 .",
    "thus , generally , structural and effective phase connectivities of a network differ ( fig .  [ connillustr]c ) , although for a small coupling they nearly coincide .",
    "below we present a technique for reconstruction of effective phase connectivity from multichannel data .",
    "suppose the phase model eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) of the system of @xmath16 interacting self - sustained oscillators is known .",
    "it is convenient to represent the right hand side of eq .",

    "\\label{pheqrhs}\\ ] ] the norm of the coupling function @xmath20 quantifies influence of the rest of the network on the oscillator @xmath2 . in order to quantify the action of a particular oscillator @xmath31 , we introduce the _ partial norms _",
    "i.e. from the fourier series we pick up only the terms depending on the phases @xmath17 , @xmath33 and terms , depending on @xmath33 .",
    "notice that in a similar way , picking up terms depending on three phases , one can quantify the joint action of two oscillators on the chosen one , @xmath34 , etc , see @xcite .",
    "thus , if the phase model ( [ pheqrhs ] ) can be reconstructed from data , we can compute partial norms @xmath35 for all combinations @xmath36 and in this way obtain a description of network connectivity .",
    "this description is quantitative and directional , since generally @xmath37 .",
    "the first step of the approach is to obtain phases of all oscillators .",
    "we assume that we measure the outputs of all nodes of the network and that these outputs are suitable for phase estimation .",
    "hence , we start with @xmath16 oscillatory time series and then compute @xmath16 continuous - time protophases @xmath38 @xcite , using e.g. , the hilbert transform or any other embedding . ( the choice of the optimal technique for protophase estimation is beyond the framework of the current study . )",
    "we recall , that the true phase of any autonomous self - sustained oscillator shall satisfy eq .",
    "( [ autphase ] ) . the angle variables ( protophases )",
    "@xmath39 provided by the hilbert transform or other techniques generally do not have this property and therefore shall be transformed to true phases @xmath40 , as discussed in the  [ app_proto ] .",
    "next step is to compute numerically the derivatives of all phases ( here it is done simply by computing central final difference ; for noisy data the application of the savitzky - golay filter is recommended ) and to fit the coefficients of the model ( [ pheq ] ) , as discussed in @xcite .    as discussed below",
    ", reconstruction is not possible if oscillators synchronize .",
    "practically , in order to exclude from the consideration the synchronous states , we compute pairwise and triplet synchronization indices @xcite according to @xmath41}\\rangle \\right |   \\label{sind2}\\ ] ] and @xmath42}\\rangle \\right    \\label{sind3}\\ ] ] notice that in eq .",
    "( [ sind2 ] ) @xmath43 are positive integers , while in eq .",
    "( [ sind3 ] ) @xmath44 can be both positive and negative .      in the presented approach we face a numerical problem related to the system s dimension .",
    "consider first @xmath45 , then the coupling functions @xmath46 are functions of two variables @xmath47 and in order to recover them by means of fitting we need that the data points cover the square @xmath48 .",
    "if two oscillators synchronize ( i.e. the index ( [ sind2 ] ) is close to one ) , then @xmath49 are functionally dependent , the points do not cover the square but fall on a line , and the function of two variables can not be recovered .",
    "if the systems are close to synchrony , the distribution of the points in the square is very inhomogeneous : the points mostly concentrate along a line but occasionally the trajectory makes an excursion , e.g. , due to noise - induced phase slips . in this case",
    "the reconstruction is possible if the observation time is sufficiently long .",
    "a detailed analysis of a dependence of accuracy of reconstruction on the values of synchronization index ( [ sind2 ] ) and of interrelation between synchrony level and required data length will be presented elsewhere . in the present contribution",
    "we concentrate on the principal problems of network reconstruction and avoid the case of strong synchrony by excluding from the further analysis the states with @xmath50 .",
    "the chosen threshold is rather arbitrary ; numerical tests demonstrate that it ensures a robust model reconstruction .",
    "let now @xmath51 and suppose that oscillators are far from synchrony .",
    "( practically we again set a threshold for the triplet synchronization index ( [ sind3 ] ) and analyze only the states with @xmath52 . ) for successful data reconstruction we need enough points to cover the cube @xmath53 . in dimension three",
    "this is still feasible , however , the amount of data required to fill the hyper - cube in dimension @xmath16 grows rapidly with the dimension , making the reconstruction of high - dimensional coupling functions hardly possible already for @xmath54 .",
    "thus , in dimensions larger than three only partial phase dynamics reconstruction is possible .",
    "the simplest and straighforward approach is to perform a pairwise analysis of the network , reconstructing the phase dynamics for all pairs of nodes . in this way",
    "one does not reconstruct the full eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) , but fits the pairwise coupling functions @xmath55 to satisfy the equation @xmath56 where all time series except for @xmath57 are ignored .",
    "the norms @xmath58 are then used for quantification of network connectivity .",
    "as we show in detail in section  [ sec : pta ] below , this estimation may yield spurious effective phase connections . indeed , suppose one has a network like in fig .  [",
    "connillustr]a and determines phase connectivity according to  ( [ pheq2 ] ) .",
    "because @xmath59 is correlated with @xmath60 , and @xmath60 drives @xmath61 , consideration of the pair @xmath62 will give non - zero coupling from @xmath59 to @xmath61 .",
    "only full phase dynamics according to eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) would reveal absence of direct coupling between @xmath59 and @xmath61 and presence of indirect coupling @xmath63 .",
    "making use of this observation , we suggest to perform _ partial triplet analysis _ for networks with more than three oscillators as well . in doing this , we reconstruct the three - dimensional coupling functions for all possible triplet configurations .",
    "namely , from the time series of three phases @xmath64 ( all indices @xmath65 are different ) we first reconstruct the coupling terms @xmath66 , ignoring all other phases . from these functions we compute , according to eq .",
    "( [ pnorm ] ) , partial norms @xmath67 for all binary connections within this triplet ( all these norms for a triplet correspond to different permutations of symbols @xmath65 ) .",
    "next , we repeat this procedure for all triplets within the network . as a result , we obtain @xmath68 estimates of @xmath69 for the connection @xmath70 , since the oscillators @xmath31 and @xmath2 belong to @xmath68 different triplets .",
    "we suggest to take the minimal value of these estimates as the final triplet - based measure of the binary effective phase connectivity : @xmath71 to support this approach , let us assume that the motif in fig .",
    "[ connillustr]a is a part of a larger network . from the triplets including oscillators",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath13 , and some disconnected oscillator @xmath72 one would obtain a strong binary term @xmath73 .",
    "however , in the triplet @xmath74 this term will be small , as here the analysis recognizes that in fact oscillator @xmath13 is driven by oscillator @xmath9 , and not by oscillator @xmath10 .",
    "this triplet will correctly yield a small value for the link @xmath73 .",
    "to demonstrate the method , we start with the case of three coupled units , where the triplet analysis gives a full description of the phase dynamics , and compare the results with the partial pairwise analysis .",
    "we introduce our approach using the example of three coupled van der pol oscillators : @xmath75   \\;,\\cr \\ddot x_2 -\\mu(1-x_2 ^ 2)\\dot x_2 + \\w_2 ^ 2 x_2 =          \\e [ \\sigma_{21}(x_1+\\dot x_1 ) + \\sigma_{23}(x_3+\\dot x_3 ) ]   \\;,\\cr \\ddot x_3 -\\mu(1-x_3 ^ 2)\\dot x_3 + \\w_3 ^ 2 x_3 =          \\e [ \\sigma_{31}(x_1+\\dot x_1 ) + \\sigma_{32}(x_2+\\dot x_2 ) ]   \\;.\\cr } \\label{vdp3}\\ ] ] here the coefficients @xmath76 are either zero or one ; they determine the structure of the coupling network in the three - oscillator system , whereas the parameter @xmath77 determines the coupling strength .",
    "the other parameters are : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the choice of the frequencies is motivated by an attempt to avoid synchronous states , where the reconstruction is not possible .",
    "we generate three - channel data by solving eq .",

    "the effect of the data length is analyzed in detail in [ app : num ] .",
    "the protophases @xmath86 are computed via the hilbert transform of observables @xmath87 and then transformed to genuine phases @xmath88 via the phase transformation , see  [ app_proto ] .",

    "[ connillustr2]a ) , see table  [ tab1](a ) .",
    "we emphasize several important issues .",
    "( i ) the reconstructed measures of the coupling strength , i.e. the norms @xmath35 , @xmath90 , corresponding to the existing structural connections are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the norms for unconnected oscillators , with an exception for the link @xmath94 , discussed next .",
    "( ii ) while oscillator @xmath13 is not connected to oscillator @xmath10 directly , there exist an indirect causal link mediated by oscillator @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the exceptionally large value @xmath95 captures some real flow of information .",
    "contrary , all values of the norms which correspond neither to a direct nor to an indirect causal link , practically vanish .",
    "this fact illustrates that although the effective phase connectivity generally differs from the structural one , this difference is not due to artifacts , but reflects the properties of the network .",
    "( iii ) as expected , the obtained norms are asymmetric , what shows that our analysis captures essentially more than simple correlation .",
    "( iv ) while the results from the triplet and the pairwise analyses , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath90 , practically coincide for existing structural links , they differ for some absent structural connections . here , the values from the triplet analysis are notably smaller than those from the pairwise one , cf .",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this happens because the oscillator 3 is not included into the pairwise model and its effect on the correlation between oscillators 1 and 2 is erroneously assigned to the link from 2 to 1 .",
    "this essential difference between the pairwise and the triple analysis will be illustrated in detail below .    in the second example ( fig .",
    "[ connillustr2]b ) two oscillators are driven by the third one . the results in table  [ tab1](b ) corroborate those from the first example .",
    "indeed , the reconstructed norms for existing connections are again essentially larger than those for the non - existing connections .",
    "moreover , here the analysis yields a perfect coincidence of the effective phase connectivity and of the given structural one . since in this configuration",
    "there are no indirect causal links , this fact substantiates the conjecture that differences between effective phase and structural connectivities are due to indirect coupling .",
    "the results from the triplet and the pairwise analysis are again identical in case of existing structural links and likewise differ when no direct structural coupling is present and the dynamics is not autonomous , as can be seen for links @xmath14 and @xmath73 .",
    "we see that here the pairwise analysis again mistakenly takes correlations due to the common drive for causal interaction .",
    "hence , for this link the pairwise analysis fails , while the triplet analysis yields reasonable results .      with the next example of a network ( fig .",
    "[ connillustr3 ] ) we want to address the obvious problem : for @xmath54 each oscillator enters more than one triplet configuration .",
    "so , e.g. the link @xmath98 can be quantified by the analysis of the triplet configurations @xmath74 and @xmath99 , and we have to choose between two results . to discuss this problem",

    "a large variety of different techniques , aimed at the quantification of interdependencies between time series , have been presented in the literature .",
    "a detailed comparison of the performance of these methods is a serious computational and programming task , and requires a separate study ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "several algorithms are implemented in software packages @xcite , see also http://hermes.ctb.upm.es .    here",
    "we discuss briefly two other methods . the first one is based on granger causality and is implemented as a user - friendly toolbox tailored to evaluate the causal connectivity underlying neural data  @xcite . with this toolbox we estimated the coupling structure for the four coupled van der pol oscillators , eqs .",
    "( [ vdp4 ] ) .",
    "comparison with our method , presented in details in [ app : cgc ] , shows that both methods basically correctly estimate structural links . on the one hand ,",
    "our method provided more homogeneous results ( all existing links have approximately the same level of coupling , while the granger causality approach gives couplings differing up to @xmath138 ) . on the other hand , the phase model",
    "based results indicate weak indirect coupling for not directly linked oscillators , while the values of the granger connectivity in this cases correspond exactly to the structural coupling .",
    "this comparison shows that quality of our approach of revealing the connectivity of oscillatory networks is comparable to the granger causality approach , with an advantage that its results are widely insensitive to the choice of parameters .",
    "next , we discuss a relation to the technique @xcite , based on computation of synchronization indices , cf .",
    "since the indices are a symmetric measure , this technique yields a non - directed measure of phase interdependence , i.e. it quantifies functional phase connectivity .",
    "the method also differentiates between existing and non - existing links .",
    "reliable performance requires that synchronization indices are rather high , so that the system should be close to synchrony , and is based on the statistics of the deviations from this synchrony ( ideal synchrony yields identity matrix which contains no information ) . on the contrary , performance of our technique is better if the network is far from synchrony ; thus , in this respect the methods are complimentary .",
    "however , the method @xcite requires the @xmath139 synchrony , i.e. closeness of the frequencies of all nodes ; our technique does not have this limitation .    as already discussed in section  [ sec2 ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ connillustr ] , the main aim of our approach is to provide a measure for _ directional _ effective phase connectivity . in this paper",
    "we present a further improvement of the previously reported studies  @xcite by including triplet interactions .",
    "this technique is complementary to other approaches where one characterizes _",
    "non - directional _ correlations , either directly for processes or via synchronization indices of phases ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in general , the phase dynamics reconstruction and correlation analysis can be applied to the same data sets , but they answer different questions , and therefore can be hardly compared directly . however , recently correlation methods have been also adopted for reconstruction of directed networks  @xcite .",
    "we believe that a synergetic application of different methods characterizing dynamical processes of network interactions among organ systems ( see  @xcite for recent advances ) would significantly contribute to progress in this field .      discussing the pros and cons of our approach",
    "we emphasize , that it explicitly exploits the assumption that all nodes of the network are active , self - sustained oscillators , so that the phase dynamics description is meaningful .",
    "this is a disadvantage of the approach , compared to the information theory based methods which are free of any assumptions regarding the type of the dynamics . on the other hand , for this particular case our technique yields an appropriate description which admits a clear physical interpretation .",
    "we clearly interpret the output of our algorithms and the recovered network structure , by theoretical argumentation and numerical demonstration , as revealing the effective phase connectivity which coincides with the structural one in case of very weak coupling and shows additional links when the coupling is not too weak .",
    "noteworthy , the additional links are not artifacts : most of them quantify the indirect influence between nodes appearing in the higher orders of phase reduction , and correspond to a causal information flow . although we can not unambiguously separate the links which are physically meaningful from those which are due to computational errors , we suggest as a rule of thumb a practical approach based on the triplet analysis .",
    "indeed , the computed norms are always positively biased and can never be zero . however , as shown in the examples of fig .",
    "[ connillustr2]a and fig .  [ connillustr3 ] , see also @xcite , the norms corresponding to the real information flow are always at least several times larger than the noise level .",
    "figure  [ fig:5rand_rescaled ] demonstrates , that the width of the distribution for the norms of non - existing structural connections is about two orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , we can reasonably assume that norms that are , say , five times larger than the minimal one , correspond to indirect connections .",
    "the discrimination can be improved using the information on the direct connections ( which can be recovered reliably , as discussed above ) : if there is a path between nodes @xmath140 via node @xmath141 , then the indirect connection @xmath142 is very likely to exist .",
    "we stress that although the method is based on the phase description eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) , it is not restricted to the case of very weak coupling . indeed , _ analytical _ derivation of eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) requires weakness of coupling , but numerical reconstruction is possible as long as the signals can be considered as nearly periodic or weakly chaotic .",
    "certainly , application of the method implies that the outputs of all nodes , suitable for phase estimation , are available .",
    "an important issue is that eq .",
    "( [ pheq ] ) is valid also for transient processes .",
    "hence , the techniques does not imply stationarity of the data .",
    "so , e.g. , if the network is repeatedly stimulated ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the pieces of data between the stimuli can be used for the phase dynamics reconstruction and , therefore , characterization of the network connectivity .",
    "moreover , repeated perturbation can be a useful tool in case when the network ( or some nodes ) are close to synchrony , so that the reconstruction without perturbation fails .",
    "perturbing the system and observing its relaxation to the synchronous state one can obtain enough data for successful application of the technique .",
    "this feature makes the technique suitable for event - related analysis . indeed ,",
    "if a single evoked response is too short , one can use for averaging data obtained in several trials .",
    "although the proposed technique yields a good differentiation between existing and non - existing links , the determination of statistical significance of small values of the connectivity measure requires an additional analysis .",
    "( we remind that these values are always positive , thus one needs a threshold for discriminating artifacts . )",
    "a natural approach is to use a surrogate data test .",
    "an example of such a test for the case of two physiological oscillators is given in @xcite .",
    "this test can be potentially extended for triplets and small networks , although a problem of constructing surrogates with a prescribed structure of cross - correlations has to be solved .",
    "since our triplet - based method performs better than the pairwise technique for the same amount of data , we expect that this better performance will manifest itself in the surrogate test analysis , to be reported elsewhere .",
    "besides , since we achieve smaller values for the truly absent connections , simple ad hoc rules like neglecting all connections which are weaker than a certain percent of the strongest one become more reliable .    as an issue for further extension of the technique we mention accounting of terms , depending on the phases of three nodes .",
    "these terms appear in the second approximation in @xmath5 even for a purely pairwise coupling and can be of the order of @xmath5 , if the coupling is nonlinear @xcite .",
    "these terms describe the joint action of two oscillators on the third one .",
    "quantification of this action is straightforward , but representation of results for a network of more than three oscillators is not trivial .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the triplet analysis of an oscillator network yields an essential improvement in the quantification of the connectivity compared to the conventional pairwise analysis .",
    "the described technique provides effective phase connectivity and allows one a reliable differentiation between structurally existing and non - existing links .",
    "the true phase @xmath143 of an autonomous oscillator is introduced according to eq .",
    "( [ autphase ] ) , i.e. it grows uniformly with time .",
    "however , an angle variable , or a protophase @xmath144 , obtained from a scalar time series by means of a two - dimensional embedding , e.g. via the hilbert transform , generally does not have this property and obeys @xmath145 if the oscillator is coupled , e.g. to another one , then its phase dynamics is described by @xmath146 where the coupling function @xmath147  the goal of our analysis  is small while the function @xmath148 is generally not , cf .",
