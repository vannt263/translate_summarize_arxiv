    "magnetism of systems with reduced dimensions is a vivid research area both because of fundamental interest and because of technological relevance . to be able to design new devices based on magnetism of clusters and thin films one should have an intuitive understanding for these , so that one can estimate beforehand which configurations and compositions might be perspective or not .",
    "magnetism of rh carries a special appeal because it concerns a material which is magnetic only in reduced dimensions and in which the spin orbit coupling ( soc ) is expected to play a more important role than in the magnetism of 3@xmath0 elements .",
    "indeed , rh magnetism seems to be quite intriguing , with results obtained so far being often controversial and not easy to interpret .",
    "catalytic properties of rh add yet another impetus for studying low - dimensional rh systems .",
    "the interest in free rh clusters was stimulated by a stern - gerlach - type experiment on clusters of 9100 atoms,@xcite where it was found that rh clusters have magnetic moments which decrease with cluster size down from 0.8  in a non - monotonous way and become strongly suppressed ( possibly to zero ) for clusters of more than 60 atoms .",
    "another experimental input comes from x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements of sessi _",
    "et al._@xcite who studied quasi - free rh clusters of few tens of atoms in a xe matrix on ag(100 ) and found that the clusters are magnetic , with an effective spin magnetic moment  of about 0.26  and with the ratio between orbital and spin magnetic moments  about 40% .",
    "recently , spin and orbital moments induced in paramagnetic rh clusters of about 220 atoms embedded in a al@xmath1o@xmath2 matrix were determined also via xmcd@xcite and it was found that the orbital moment  does not exceed 2% of .    for a deeper understanding of the magnetism of free rh clusters and of rh magnetism in general it would be useful to identify general trends which rh - based systems obey .",
    "this could be achieved by monitoring the trends for a large set of related systems and comparing them with the situation for ( much better studied ) 3@xmath0 elements .",
    "such a study should be performed in a relativistic way because only then possible effects of soc can be properly included .",
    "also , experiments pose some questions that call for fully relativistic calculations  such as the above mentioned issue of small  measured by xmcd for a set of paramagnetic clusters embedded in al@xmath3o@xmath2 ( ref .  ) in contrast to large  measured for ferromagnetic clusters in a xe matrix.@xcite    a considerable effort was devoted to theoretical research on free rh clusters recently .",
    "even though interesting and important results were obtained , only few systematic studies for large sets of systems were done so only an incomplete picture could have been gathered .",
    "this is even more true concerning relativistic properties such as orbital magnetism .",
    "most _ ab initio _ studies focused on clusters of less than 20 atoms and specifically on their geometries .",
    "it turns out that small clusters often tend to have non - compact shapes.@xcite the situation is still not clear because different density functional theory ( dft ) implementations predict different structures and spin configurations.@xcite pseudopotential calculations seem to give rise to more open structures than all - electron calculations.@xcite structural studies for large clusters were performed only within a model @xmath0-band tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian and it was found that the relaxation of bond distances for fcc clusters of 13 - 165 atoms is non - uniform , with some distances decreasing and some distances increasing.@xcite    it emerges that the existence of more competing configurations is typical for rh clusters and sometimes the configurations differ only little in energies but considerably in magnetic moments.@xcite it seems that a similar situation arises regarding the suppression of magnetism for large clusters , which occurs for sizes between 60 and 100 atoms according to the experiment.@xcite e.g. , model hamiltonian calculations found that for fcc clusters of 55 and 79 atoms magnetic solutions exist but are higher in energy than non - magnetic solutions.@xcite for clusters of 135 and 165 atoms , no magnetic solutions were found.@xcite pseudopotential calculations for icosahedral clusters yield a finite moment for a 55-atoms cluster and a zero moment for a 147-atoms cluster.@xcite at the same time , in order to explain their xmcd experiments , barthem _ et al._@xcite suggest that the stoner criterion may be locally fulfilled at only some atoms in large rh clusters , giving rise to an inhomogeneous magnetic state .",
    "connected with the question of size - dependence of magnetic moments is the question of the dependence of local magnetic moments on the coordination numbers . for 3@xmath0 clusters ( both free@xcite and supported)@xcite",
    "a distinct relation could be identified in this respect . however , this need not be transferable to 4@xmath0 clusters and there are some hints that a relation of this kind may be absent in rh systems.@xcite however , no systematic study about this has been performed so far .",
    "the issue of orbital moments has not yet attracted much theoretical attention .",
    "model @xmath0-band tb hamiltonian calculations were performed for few rh clusters of up to 27 atoms.@xcite it was found that  is typically 1020% of .",
    "the orbital moment  is nearly always parallel to  and when it is antiparallel to , it is very small .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "calculations performed for rh clusters of 27 atoms lead to similar conclusions : spin and orbital magnetic moments are always parallel to each other and the  ratio is about 10% , except for the smallest clusters.@xcite in all these studies the soc was added in a second variation approach . however",
    ", the soc may play a more important role in 4@xmath0 clusters and it is not clear whether it can be fully accounted for in this way .",
    "recalling also that recent xmcd studies led to opposite conclusions regarding the  ratio,@xcite a more detailed study of orbital magnetism of rh clusters is desirable .",
    "concerning the interpretation of experiments , let us mention finally that the xmcd sum rules do not provide a `` bare '' spin moment  but only its combination with the magnetic dipole @xmath4 term , .",
    "it is conceivable that a disagreement between theory and experiment may arise partly due to the effect of the @xmath4 term.@xcite earlier calculations for rh@xmath5 and rh@xmath6 clusters suggest that this influence should not be crucial for free clusters@xcite but this ought to be analyzed more deeply and for a large set of systems .",
    "it turns out that despite the intense attention that has been devoted to theoretical research on free rh clusters , some important issues remain to be solved .",
    "one of them is whether there is any systematic relation between local magnetic moments and coordination numbers as in 3@xmath0 clusters or whether such a relation is totally absent . linked to this",
    "is a question whether the stoner criterion can be applied locally , i.e. , whether it could be used to estimate local magnetic moments in large clusters .",
    "the relatively large soc implies a question to what extent will scalar - relativistic results differ from fully - relativistic results .",
    "how important is orbital magnetism in rh clusters , especially in large ones ?",
    "is it possible to reconcile large  ratios obtained via xmcd by sessi _",
    "et al._@xcite with small  ratios obtained by barthem _",
    "et al._?@xcite what is the role of the magnetic dipole term @xmath4 ?",
    "could it possibly be responsible for the deviations between some theories and xmcd experiments ?    to address these issues , we performed a fully - relativistic theoretical study of clusters of 13135 atoms and also of free - standing monolayers ( for comparison ) .",
    "we found that some important intuitive concepts which proved to be useful in magnetism of 3@xmath0 metals , such as the relationship between magnetic moments and coordination numbers , are not applicable to rh clusters ( and surfaces alike ) .",
    "some other concepts , such as the stoner model linking magnetic moments to dos at the fermi level , remain to be valid and useful .",
    "the calculations were performed in an _ ab - initio _ way within the spin density functional theory , relying on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) as parametrized by vosko _",
    "et al._@xcite the electronic structure is described fully relativistically by the corresponding dirac equation .",
    "the computational approach is based on the multiple - scattering or korringa - kohn - rostoker formalism@xcite as implemented in the sprkkr code.@xcite the electronic structure problem is solved completely in real space .",
    "the potentials were treated within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) . for the angular momentum expansion of the green function , a cutoff of @xmath7=3 was used .",
    "only collinear magnetic structures were considered in this study .",
    "the clusters were assumed to be spherical - like , containing 13135 atoms , with fcc geometry as if cut from the bulk rh crystal .",
    "they are centered either around an atom ( 13 , 19 , 43 , 55 , 79 , 87 , and 135 atoms ) or around an interstitial empty site ( 14 , 38 , and 68 atoms ) .",
    "no structural relaxation was performed .",
    "the vacuum region was represented by empty sites located at lattice points .",
    "the network of these empty sites was built so that an empty site was included if it was a first- or second - nearest neighbor to any cluster atom .",
    "we also performed some comparative calculations for isolated or free - standing ( 001 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 111 ) monolayers and for the ( 001 ) crystal surface .",
    "these calculations were performed using supercell ( multilayer ) geometries . to simulate the crystal surface , we employed a slab consisting of 17 layers of rh atoms .",
    "successive rh monolayers or slabs were separated by 1320    of vacuum in the supercell .",
    "the integration over the @xmath8-points was done on a regular mesh and for each of the systems the integration grid was chosen so that its density corresponds to ( at least ) 15625 @xmath8-points in the full brillouin zone of the bulk rh crystal .",
    "otherwise the calculations were done as for the free clusters .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     a large antiparallel  for some rh clusters was obtained by our fully - relativistic _ ab - initio _ calculations but not by earlier model @xmath0-band tb hamiltonian calculations where the soc was added within the second variation approach.@xcite a detailed comparison between our results and the model hamiltonian results is presented in tab .",
    "[ tab - compar ] for rh@xmath9 and rh@xmath5 clusters ( moments for the same geometries are shown ) .",
    "one can see that there is a general agreement between both calculations but differences occur for some atoms .",
    "all our calculations were done for bulk - like , i.e. , unrelaxed geometries .",
    "changing the interatomic distances would of course affect the calculated  and . _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "calculations for clusters of 219 atoms found that bond - length contraction of 48  % may lead to large changes of magnetic moments , in particular for a 4-atoms cluster and a 10-atoms cluster.@xcite however , the bond length changes are less important for large clusters  in fact , model hamiltonian calculations suggest a bond - length contraction of about 4  % for clusters of 813 atoms but only 13  % for clusters of 55 and 147 atoms.@xcite another study based on semi - empirical potential and model @xmath10 tb hamiltonians found that the average nearest - neighbor distance is close to the bulk - like distance for clusters of more than about 20 atoms.@xcite let us also mention a model hamiltonian study which found that using equilibrium bond lengths instead of bulk bond lengths changes  and  by about 50  % for a cluster of 13 atoms while for clusters of 19 and 27 atoms the bond relaxation decreases  only by about 10% and  by about 20%.@xcite the fcc growth mode adopted here is plausible in the light of the _ ab initio _ study of futschek _ et al._@xcite who found that clusters of more than about ten atoms adopt ground state geometries that can be considered as fragments of the fcc crystal structure . we conclude that while small clusters of less than @xmath1110 atoms are quite sensitive to structural relaxation , results for large rh clusters are not so dependent on whether the structural relaxation has been performed or not .",
    "when compared with experiment on free rh clusters,@xcite our calculation gives higher average magnetic moments in the 1355 atoms size range .",
    "a @xmath0 band tb model hamiltonian study of fcc clusters@xcite gave similar values as our study while an _ ab initio _ pseudopotential - based calculations of icosahedral clusters@xcite led to smaller values , in a better agreement with the experiment .",
    "however , one should be cautious about drawing conclusions , say , about preference of the icosahedral geometry over the fcc geometry just from this : in all the theoretical studies , only few cluster sizes were considered beyond the 20-atoms limit and the dependence of the average magnetic moment on the cluster size displays a quasi - oscillatory behavior , so one can not be sure how representative the results are .",
    "one should also take into account that in the case of small clusters , where more theoretical studies we performed , the results often differ substantially from one study to another.@xcite it turns out that accurate calculations which could be directly compared to experiment are very difficult to perform because the systems are quite complex and there are many factors to control .",
    "therefore , it is useful to perform a study like the current one which focuses on the analysis of general trends and rules which the rh cluster should obey , to improve our intuitive understanding .",
    "some important intuitive concepts which proved to be useful in interpreting the magnetism of 3@xmath0 metals are not applicable to magnetism of 4@xmath0 systems such as rh clusters . in particular",
    "there is no systematic relation between local magnetic moments and coordination numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "the stoner model describes even local aspect of rh magnetism quite well ; atoms for which the dos in the non - magnetic state @xmath12 is more than 20 states per spin per ry will be magnetic .",
    "fully - relativistic calculations indicate that there can be large  antiparallel to  for some atoms",
    ". the intra - atomic  term can be quite large at certain sites but as a whole it is unlikely to affect the interpretation of xmcd experiments based on the sum rules . for clusters in the @xmath11100",
    "atoms size range it is likely that there will be metastable magnetic configurations , with excitation energies less than 0.1  mry per atom .",
