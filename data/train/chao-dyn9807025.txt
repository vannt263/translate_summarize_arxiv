    "there exist many instances where the dynamics of a system depends on a parameter which varies slowly in time .",
    "this parameter is often controllable by the experimentalist , who can modify it at will .",
    "a well  known example of this situation is that of a ferromagnet on which is imposed a low frequency magnetic field .",
    "one can also think of chemical reactions occurring in a reactor in which the flux of the injected chemical substances is varying slowly , or the couette ",
    "taylor experiment in hydrodynamics where the speed of rotation of the inner cylinder is slowly modulated .",
    "in other circumstances , the parameter is not controllable , but certainly influences the dynamics of the system of interest . as examples of this situation we could mention the case of the impact of solar light on the thermal convection in the atmosphere , or the seasonal ( or even climatic ) effect on the dynamics of populations .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomena observed in systems with an adiabatically varying parameter is the familiar one of hysteresis .",
    "recently , there has been a renewal of interest in this old problem , both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view .",
    "several authors @xcite have particularly analysed properties of the hysteresis cycle , such as its area , which appears to scale in a nontrivial way with the adiabatic parameter .    in this article",
    ", we concentrate on dynamical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , depending on a parameter in such a way that the system undergoes bifurcations when the parameter is considered to be static .",
    "the static ( or `` frozen '' ) situation corresponds to measurements made , in principle during very long times , at successive fixed values of the parameter .",
    "we then ask what is happening when the parameter is varying slowly in time , instead of being kept fixed .",
    "this question is closely related to the opposite one : can the static bifurcation diagram be determined experimentally by varying the parameter slowly in time ( a possible temptation for the impatient experimentalist ) ?    we have recently developed a coherent mathematical framework to deal with adiabatic systems , in particular to show existence of hysteresis cycles and determine their scaling laws @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explain these methods by illustrating them on a few concrete physical examples .",
    "we begin , in section [ sec_1d ] , by presenting the most important features of one  dimensional ( 1d ) systems , which are illustrated by a few generic examples .",
    "we discuss in particular a simple geometric method to determine scaling laws near bifurcation points .    in section [ sec_lz",
    "] , we use the lorenz model to illustrate the phenomenon of bifurcation delay .",
    "when translated into the language of rayleigh  bnard ( rb ) convection , this phenomenon means that the slow and periodic variation of the temperature gradient in time leads to a delayed appearance of convection rolls and to hysteresis .",
    "the lorenz model being a good approximation close to the instability threshold , since it contains two dominant modes of the bifurcation , this delay should be observable in the real rb convection .",
    "to explain the delay , we introduce two new methods especially designed for @xmath0dimensional ( @xmath0d ) systems : dynamic diagonalization and adiabatic manifolds .    in section [ sec_mh ]",
    ", we present a simple mean field model for the dynamics of a ferromagnet in a slowly oscillating magnetic field . in the 1d case",
    ", we discuss the concept of dynamic phase transition introduced in @xcite , and derive a scaling law for the hysteresis area . in the 2d case",
    ", we examine the effect of anisotropy on the mechanism of magnetization reversal and the shape of hysteresis cycles .    in section [ sec_rp ] , we discuss a simple mechanical system ( which was introduced in @xcite ) , displaying chaotic instead of periodic hysteresis .",
    "this phenomenon depends only on a few qualitative features of the system , and should be observable in a larger class of nonlinear oscillators including inertia and involving a symmetry breaking bifurcation .    finally , section [ sec_ec ] is dedicated to some examples of the effect of eigenvalue crossings .",
    "these crossing give rise to an effective interaction between otherwise independent modes , which is essential in the sense that it can not be eliminated by a change of variables .",
    "the interaction may , however , be delayed in certain cases .    throughout this text ,",
    "we use the following mathematical setting .",
    "the `` frozen '' dynamical system is supposed to be described by a family of ordinary differential equations @xmath1 the associated adiabatic system is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a given function , and @xmath4 is the small .",
    "it is useful to introduce the @xmath5 , so that can be rewritten as @xmath6 or , in short form , @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the usual scalar product in @xmath9 and by @xmath10 the euclidean norm .",
    "there is a large literature on singular perturbed problems of this type .",
    "results on linear systems can be found in @xcite . for a review of results on dynamic bifurcations ,",
    "see @xcite . in particular",
    ", the phenomenon of bifurcation delay has been rigorously analysed in two important articles by neishtadt @xcite .",
    "certain hysteresis phenomena in slow ",
    "fast systems similar to the van der pol equation have been analysed in @xcite . our geometric method to determine scaling exponents , as well as the procedures using dynamic diagonalization and adiabatic manifolds , however , are new to our knowledge .",
    "here we only outline some essential ideas of these methods , detailed proofs can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will consider one  dimensional ( 1d ) adiabatic equations of the form @xmath11 where the dot denotes derivation with respect to @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is assumed to be an analytic real  valued function ( weaker results as those stated below hold for differentiable functions ) .",
    "the static bifurcation diagram of is obtained by determining the solutions of @xmath14 , which are generically curves subdividing the plane into regions where @xmath15 is positive or negative .",
    "let @xmath16 be such an equilibrium curve .",
    "the  tells us that if the linearization @xmath17 does not vanish , then @xmath16 is a smooth curve .",
    "it corresponds to stable solutions if @xmath18 is negative , and to unstable ones of @xmath18 is positive .    in such a situation",
    ", one can prove the existence of a particular solution @xmath19 of the adiabatic equation tracking the curve @xmath16 at a distance of order @xmath4 : @xmath20 moreover , this solution admits an asymptotic power series in @xmath4 , which does not converge in general , but admits , however , an optimal truncation at exponentially small order : @xmath21 we call @xmath19 an associated with the equilibrium branch @xmath16 .",
    "other solutions of are attracted or repelled exponentially fast by adiabatic ones , and tend to switch between the s of different equilibrium branches in a time of order @xmath22 . as long as there are no bifurcation points ,",
    "the solutions thus remain most of the time close to equilibria , and there is no hysteresis in the system .",
    "let us now consider the effect of bifurcations .",
    "at these special points , several equilibrium branches may meet , causing the solutions to choose between several possible directions , which is the basic mechanism of hysteresis .",
    "moreover , equilibrium branches are in general no longer tracked at a distance of order @xmath4 , but at a distance scaling in some other , nontrivial way with @xmath4 , which we now show how to compute .",
    "if the origin is a bifurcation point of @xmath15 , we can write in some @xmath23 assume that @xmath13 admits an equilibrium branch scaling as @xmath24 ( we use this notation to indicate that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are positive constants independent of @xmath12 and @xmath4 ) . a standard result of bifurcation theory states that @xmath27 is necessarily equal to the slope of a segment of .",
    "this polygon is constructed as the convex envelope of the set of points @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , completed by a horizontal and a vertical ( ) . the linearization @xmath17 scales generically as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ordinate at @xmath32 of the tangent to newton s polygon with slope @xmath27 .",
    "these two easily determined numbers @xmath31 and @xmath33 are usually sufficient to characterize the scaling behaviour at leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , different behaviours take place in an @xmath34 and in an @xmath35 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath36 is a decreasing stable branch arriving at the bifurcation point , above which @xmath15 is negative , one can show that @xmath37    combining a local analysis around bifurcation points with a global analysis , which is usually easy in 1d , one can determine the qualitative properties of dynamics . in particular , if @xmath3 is a periodic function , one can construct the poincar map ( which is necessarily a monotonous function ) in order to prove existence of hysteresis cycles and determine their scaling laws .",
    "let us illustrate this procedure on the simple model equation given by @xmath38 mathematically , this function is a generic two ",
    "parameter perturbation of the vector field @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "physically , it describes the overdamped motion of a particle in a ginzburg ",
    "landau potential @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the difference between the temperature and its critical value , and @xmath42 is an external field .",
    "the quartic potential described by the first two terms is fairly generic in physical systems presenting the symmetry @xmath43 , while the linear term is the simplest possible asymmetric perturbation .",
    "we begin with the situation where @xmath44 is fixed , and @xmath45 is slowly oscillating .",
    "the equation @xmath46 admits a single , stable equilibrium branch @xmath47 , given implicitly by @xmath48 .",
    "all solutions are attracted by a periodic solution @xmath49 , enclosing an area of order @xmath4 ( a ) . in the adiabatic limit @xmath50",
    ", this area vanishes and there is no hysteresis .",
    "if @xmath51 and @xmath45 , the unique equilibrium branch @xmath52 admits the origin as a bifurcation point . using newton s polygon or a direct calculation , we find that the exponents determining the scaling behaviour are @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( a ) .",
    "the orbits are attracted by a periodic one , crossing the @xmath55axis at a distance of order @xmath56 from the origin , and enclosing an area @xmath57 ( b ) .",
    "the cycle still collapses with @xmath58 in the adiabatic limit , but with a much slower rate .",
    "these exponents have been found in @xcite using other methods ( which are less general than ours ) .",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath45 , there are two bifurcation points at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "two stable branches @xmath63 and one unstable branch @xmath64 meet at these bifurcation points ( a ) . since they are crossed with nonzero velocity , newton s polygon shows that the associated exponents are @xmath65 ( b ) .",
    "in fact , close to these points , the dynamics in translated coordinates is governed by the equation @xmath66 solutions cross the @xmath67axis at @xmath68 . using the scaling @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one shows that @xmath67 remains of order @xmath71 until a time @xmath72 , and then quickly leaves the bifurcation region to jump on the other stable branch .",
    "the orbits are attracted by a hysteresis cycle with area satisfying @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the area situated between @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "this time , the hysteretic behaviour persists in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the main contribution of order @xmath78 to the excess area comes from the delayed jump .",
    "the scaling law was also obtained in @xcite using an exact solution of ( without the higher order terms ) .    as a final example , let us consider the situation where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the varying parameter .",
    "the static bifurcation diagram displays a pitchfork bifurcation at the origin , involving the branches @xmath81 and @xmath82 , for which @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( c ) .",
    "an important new phenomenon is : near @xmath85 , the dynamics is essentially governed by the linearized equation @xmath86 starting at a time where @xmath87 , @xmath88 remains exponentially small as long as the integral in is negative , which is true for a while beyond the instant where @xmath89 becomes positive .",
    "if the solution finally jumps on the stable branch and @xmath89 is decreased again , this branch is followed adiabatically , which leads to hysteresis ( b ) .",
    "the area of the cycle follows the scaling law @xmath90 where @xmath91 depends on the bifurcation delay time .",
    "these examples indicate that one - dimensional systems are relatively well understood .",
    "in fact , our method to determine scaling laws is general , and quite straightforward to apply to other bifurcations than the special cases described here .",
    "moreover , one can expect that when a mode of a larger system undergoes bifurcation , the dynamics of the associated adiabatic system will be governed by an effective 1d equation , describing the motion of this particular mode , which explains why the same scaling laws are observed for more complicated systems .",
    "the lorenz model discussed in the next section illustrates this reduction of variables .",
    "let us now turn to the behaviour of higher  dimensional systems @xmath92 adiabatic solutions with an expansion of the form still exist in the vicinity of equilibria , branches of equilibrium points around which the linearization of @xmath15 has no purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "the behaviour of neighbouring solutions is far more complicated to analyse than in the 1d case .",
    "one can , however , obtain valuable informations by analysing the linearized system first , before dealing with nonlinear terms using appropriate tools such as invariant manifolds .",
    "we illustrate these techniques on the lorenz model with slowly varying temperature gradient @xmath93 : @xmath94 where we assume that @xmath95 .",
    "this model has been introduced as an approximation to rayleigh  bnard convection , but also describes other systems such as lasers .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath96 is fixed , the origin is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point , whereas when @xmath97 , the origin is hyperbolic and two new equilibria @xmath98 appear , which correspond physically to convection rolls",
    ".    we will study this system when @xmath93 is slowly oscillating around @xmath99 , and stays well below the chaotic region .",
    "it can be written in compact form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is quadratic .",
    "note that the identically zero function is a particular solution of this equation .",
    "the matrix @xmath102 has three eigenvalues @xmath103 the eigenvalues @xmath104 and @xmath105 are always negative , while @xmath106 has the same sign as @xmath107 .",
    "we thus expect that the motion will essentially follow the eigenspace of @xmath106 .",
    "for this reason , we will construct a change of variables isolating this particular direction . to do this",
    ", we begin by searching a linear transformation which should diagonalize the linear part of . to this end , observe that if @xmath108 is a matrix satisfying @xmath109 where @xmath110 is diagonal , then the change of variables @xmath111 transforms into @xmath112 the key point is that we can prove the existence of a bounded solution of , admitting asymptotic series @xmath113 which can be truncated to exponentially small order , just as the adiabatic solution . can be multiplied by a function of time , which will of course affect terms of order @xmath4 in @xmath114 . ] in particular , @xmath115 is the matrix diagonalizing @xmath116 statically , and the entries of @xmath117 are eigenvalues of @xmath102 .",
    "the proof uses the fact that @xmath118 .    in the specific case of the lorenz equations , a linear transformation given to leading order by @xmath119 yields the equation @xmath120 where @xmath121",
    ", @xmath122 is diagonal with entries @xmath123 and @xmath105 , and @xmath124 , @xmath125 are quadratic .    in order to deal with the nonlinear terms",
    ", we introduce invariant manifolds .",
    "consider the partial differential equation @xmath126 it can be shown that this equation admits , in a  of @xmath127 , a solution @xmath128 . when @xmath97 , it lies at a distance of order @xmath4 from the instantaneous unstable manifold of the origin , but it can be continued to times where @xmath129 .",
    "the change of variables @xmath130 transforms the second equation of into @xmath131 where @xmath132 is of order @xmath133 .",
    "this equation admits @xmath134 as invariant manifold . a similar change of variables @xmath135 transforms the first equation into @xmath136 defining a stable manifold separating the basins of attraction of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "since @xmath139 has negative eigenvalues , one easily shows that @xmath140 goes to zero exponentially fast .",
    "thus the effective dynamics will take place on the invariant manifold @xmath141 , where it is governed by the scalar equation @xmath142 ( @xmath143 on the unstable manifold @xmath134 ) .",
    "as @xmath93 is varied periodically around @xmath99 , @xmath144 changes sign .",
    "the situation is thus very similar to the last example of section [ sec_1d ] .",
    "assume that @xmath145 becomes negative at @xmath146 , positive at @xmath147 , and negative again at @xmath148 .",
    "asymptotically , the solution will stay close to the origin for @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the defined by the relation @xmath151 ( this time exists if the average of @xmath145 over one period is positive , otherwise solutions stay indefinitely close to the origin ) . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the asymptotic solution follows @xmath137 or @xmath138 adiabatically .",
    "thus the bifurcation delay leads once again to ( ) .",
    "when @xmath93 is varied back and forth ( at least when @xmath153 does not become too large ) , the solution always follows the _ same _ equilibrium ( which one it chooses depends on the initial condition ) . in the case of rayleigh  bnard convection , @xmath154 measures the rotation frequency of convection rolls .",
    "when @xmath93 is increased , these rolls will appear suddenly , with a positive frequency , at some @xmath155 .",
    "when @xmath93 is decreased again , they slowly decelerate to disappear smoothly as @xmath153 becomes smaller than 1 .",
    "the rolls will always turn in the same direction .",
    "we believe that it would be interesting to try to observe this delay experimentally .",

    "interest in a microscopic understanding of hysteresis and associated scaling laws has been renewed by the numerical study of @xcite .",

    "a more careful analysis of the poincar map shows that even though there is a small region where stable f and p  cycles can coexist , the transition is sharp , in the sense that the average magnetization jumps discontinuously from one cycle to another . in @xcite , a smooth transition , where the magnetization goes to @xmath207 continuously , has been observed for larger values of @xmath4 .",

    "its coordinates are determined by the relations @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the resulting hysteresis cycle is composed of two triangular loops ( ) , since after leaving the unstable position @xmath234 or @xmath221 , the magnetization drops to the transverse branch , which it follows until merging with the longitudinal branch .",
    "we point out that if the magnetic field is slightly tilted with respect to the eigenvectors of @xmath161 , the pitchfork bifurcations in transform into saddle",
    " nodes , which suppresses the bifurcation delay .",

    "the first one is a bifurcation delay similar to the one already observed in previous examples : when @xmath235 is increased beyond 1 , the pendulum remains for some time in unstable equilibrium close to the origin , before joining one of the stable equilibria @xmath253 or @xmath254 .",
    "when @xmath235 is decreased again below 1 , the pendulum follows this equilibrium until it joins the origin again , leading to hysteresis .",
    "the second interesting phenomenon is related to the sequence of visited equilibria , which depends on the value of the adiabatic parameter ( ) . for some values , the pendulum always chooses the same equilibrium , just as the lorenz system always chooses the same direction of rotation for the convection rolls . for other values of @xmath4 , however , one observes a sequence with twice the driving period , in which the pendulum visits alternatively the equilibria @xmath253 and @xmath254 . between these periodic behaviours",
    ", it is even possible to observe apparently random sequences , which we called @xcite .    in order to explain this behaviour",
    ", we now compute an asymptotic expression for the poincar map in the @xmath255plane , during one period of @xmath256 .",
    "if @xmath256 remains within the interval @xmath257 , the system can be reduced to 1d as in section [ sec_lz ] , and there is no possibility for chaotic motion .",
    "we thus consider the case where @xmath256 has a larger amplitude ( ) .",

    ", we obtain that @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the dynamic phase of oscillations around the origin , and the columns of @xmath268 are close to the eigenvectors associated with the origin . the positive factors @xmath269 describe the asymmetric contraction due to the difference between @xmath270 and @xmath271 , and the @xmath272 are geometric phase shifts .",
    "it can be shown that the effect of nonlinear terms can be absorbed in these small geometric corrections .",
    "the part of motion between @xmath273 and @xmath274 is essentially nonlinear . near the origin",
    ", we may use invariant manifolds as in section [ sec_lz ] to transform into @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are of order @xmath278 .",
    "starting at @xmath273 with a small initial condition @xmath279 , the second equation in shows that @xmath280 becomes exponentially small .",
    "the first one is used to prove that @xmath281 reaches a distance @xmath282 from the origin ( @xmath282 not too large ) at a time @xmath283 , where @xmath284 provided @xmath285 ( for smaller @xmath286 , the orbit does not reach @xmath253 before the time @xmath287 ) .",
    "for @xmath288 , the trajectory is attracted by @xmath253 , around which we carry out a similar analysis than around the origin , with the result @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath291 , while @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath294 are constant at lowest order in @xmath4 .",
    "the position at @xmath274 thus depends essentially on @xmath286 through the delayed bifurcation time @xmath295 , in such a way that is the parametric equation of a squeezed spiral ( which is essentially the image of the unstable manifold of the origin under the flow from @xmath273 to @xmath274 ) .    combining this result with",
    ", we finally obtain a poincar map of the form @xmath296 where @xmath297 measures the distance to the stable manifold of the origin ( it is close to @xmath33 ) , and @xmath298 measures the distance to the unstable manifold .",
    "this expression is valid for @xmath299 , but is easily extended to negative @xmath286 , since the poincar map is odd .",
    "the dynamics is thus essentially determined by the 1d map @xmath300 , which is oscillating around @xmath301 ( ) .",
    "one easily shows the existence of a positive constant @xmath89 such that , if @xmath302 , this map admits stable fixed points at @xmath303 , which correspond to cycles of period 1 . when @xmath304 , there is an orbit of period 2 , for which the pendulum alternatively visits the left and right equilibrium ( ) .",
    "these properties can be shown to hold for the 2d map , which is confirmed by numerical simulations ( ) .",
    "chaotic motion is possible in the intermediate regions , where @xmath305 .",
    "for the 2d map , it is difficult to prove existence of such a motion , but one can do more for the simplified 1d map , using symbolic dynamics .",
    "in fact , when @xmath306 and under certain conditions on @xmath307 , one finds that @xmath308 behaves as in a : it vanishes at two points @xmath309 and @xmath310 , and , being odd , also at @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "these points define four intervals @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 and @xmath316 , and the maximum of @xmath317 on @xmath315 is larger than @xmath310 , while its minimum on @xmath316 is smaller than @xmath311 .",

    "it is known @xcite that for every path in the markov graph , there exists an orbit visiting the corresponding sequence of intervals .",
    "in particular , using sarkovskii s theorem @xcite , it is possible to prove the existence of periodic orbits of every period except possibly 3 .",
    "the mathematical pendulum analysed here has been realized experimentally , and all the phenomena predicted by the equations have been observed .",
    "they depend , in fact , only on a few qualitative features of the system .",
    "the origin should be a focus for some values of the parameter , in order to allow the orbits to wind around it .",
    "it should be hyperbolic for other values of the parameter , for which two new stable equilibria should exist .",
    "chaotic motion requires , in addition , these asymmetric equilibria to be sometimes focuses , in order to create the oscillations in the poincar map . under these conditions",
    ", it should be possible to observe chaotic hysteresis for other nonlinear oscillators ( see section [ ssec_cruise ] ) .",
    "we mentioned in section [ sec_lz ] that adiabatic linear systems of the form @xmath321 could be diagonalized ( and thus solved ) by the change of variables @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is a matrix satisfying the equation @xmath324 and @xmath114 is a suitable diagonal matrix .",
    "this procedure is only useful , however , if we manage to control the transformation matrix @xmath323 , which should be bounded ( close to the matrix @xmath115 which diagonalizes @xmath116 statically ) .",
    "such a control turns out to be possible at least in two cases : when the eigenvalues of @xmath102 have different real parts , or , ( in a more restricted sense ) when they have the same real part but different imaginary parts .",
    "this leaves open the question of the effect of different types of eigenvalue crossings .",
    "the most generic case , when @xmath116 is not diagonalizable at the crossing time , has been mentioned in section [ sec_rp ] .",
    "it can be studied using the properties of airy functions ( see also @xcite ) . in the present section",
    ", we illustrate the effect of two other types of crossing .",
    "the first one occurs when @xmath102 is symmetric , and can thus be diagonalized even when it has identical eigenvalues .",
    "the second one arises when the eigenvalues real parts cross , but their imaginary parts are different .",
    "we call this situation ; it is closely related to properties of dynamic hopf bifurcations discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the overdamped motion of a particle in the 2d potential @xmath325 where @xmath116 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "the equation of motion can be written @xmath326 we assume that the matrix @xmath102 is given by @xmath327 so that it admits eigenvalues @xmath328 and eigenvectors @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath331 has minima at @xmath332 if @xmath333 is positive , and at @xmath334 if @xmath333 is negative . to diagonalize the linearized equation @xmath321 ,",
    "we may try to solve equation with matrices @xmath323 and @xmath114 of the form @xmath335 substitution of this ansatz in yields the relations @xmath336 if @xmath18 does not vanish ( when there is no eigenvalue crossing ) , these equations admit equilibrium branches at @xmath337 , of opposite stability . by the results of section [ sec_1d ] , we know that they admit particular adiabatic solutions @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "the evolution operator of the linearized system can thus be written @xmath340 the columns of @xmath268 can be considered as which are close to the static eigenvectors @xmath341 .",
    "they define invariant subspaces ( depending on @xmath12 ) , in which the motion is expanding , resp.contracting .",
    "when @xmath18 is allowed to vanish , new phenomena occur because the equations , undergo bifurcation .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case @xmath342 , for three different functions @xmath343 ( 1 ) @xmath344 , ( 2 ) @xmath345 and ( 3 ) @xmath346 .    if @xmath344 , admits the solution @xmath347 , and @xmath348 .",
    "the evolution operator can thus be written @xmath349 the subspaces @xmath350 and @xmath351 are invariant . if @xmath352 , @xmath353 remains exponentially small until @xmath354 , which is the standard bifurcation delay .",
    "if @xmath345 , it is not possible to construct solutions of remaining indefinitely close to @xmath355 . the best one can do is to construct periodic solutions @xmath356 and @xmath357 admitting a discontinuity of order @xmath358 , respectively at times @xmath359 and @xmath360 ( a ) . as a result , for @xmath361 we have @xmath362 where @xmath363 with @xmath364 .",
    "the off - diagonal term of this matrix induces a transition between the directions which were invariant before @xmath365 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath354 , we have to leading order in @xmath4 @xmath366 this transformation rotates the vertical axis by almost @xmath367 . the matrix @xmath368 is found to rotate the horizontal axis by almost @xmath369 .",
    "this means that there exists no invariant subspace in which the particle performs an independent motion .",
    "the eigenvalue crossing thus results in an interaction between both modes , with the particle always following the most unstable direction .",
    "the sign of the discontinuities of @xmath370 is important : in this case it induces a back  and  forth oscillation of the particle between two wells ( a ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath371 , the situation is similar , but with a discontinuity of @xmath372 of opposite sign ( b ) . as a result , the coordinate axes are always rotated in the same direction , and the particle visits all four wells in a row ( b ) .",
    "we call the situation arising when some eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath116 drift past one another at some imaginary distance",
    ". this cruising also leads to an interaction between the modes ; however , unlike in the case of diagonal crossing , this interaction is .",
    "eigenvalue cruisings appear in particular in coupled oscillators .",
    "consider for instance the system @xmath373 which was introduced by kobayashi @xcite to describe the vibrations of a buckled plate with supersonic flow on one side of the plate .",
    "the variables @xmath374 and @xmath375 are amplitudes of the two dominant fourier modes of the deflection , @xmath42 is the in ",
    "plane compressive stress , @xmath89 the dynamic fluid pressure of the supersonic flow , and @xmath376 are friction coefficients ( which were taken equal in @xcite ) .    introducing @xmath377 and @xmath378 , can be written as a 4d first order system for the variables @xmath379 , which admits the origin as an equilibrium .",
    "the linearization around the origin is a @xmath380 matrix with eigenvalues @xmath381 an eigenvalue cruising arises for instance in the following situation : assume @xmath382 , @xmath383 and @xmath51 , so that @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "as @xmath42 increases from @xmath386 to @xmath387 , the complex eigenvalues @xmath388 correspond to oscillations , while the real eigenvalues @xmath389 describe an overdamped motion .",
    "there is a cruising at @xmath390 and the origin becomes unstable at @xmath391 ( ) . the same qualitative features hold for small positive coupling @xmath89 .",
    "we are interested in the following question .",
    "assume that @xmath42 is increased monotonically and adiabatically , starting with a generic initial condition at a time @xmath146 where @xmath42 is smaller than 1 .",
    "for what value of @xmath42 does the trajectory depart from the origin ?",
    "the answer turns out to be related in a rather subtle way to bifurcation delay and eigenvalue cruising .",
    "it is easier to explain this phenomenon on the simple model equation @xmath392 as in kobayashi s equations , @xmath393 represents the overdamped mode , and @xmath104 the oscillating one ( in complex notation ) .",
    "the cruising occurs at @xmath394 . to diagonalize this equation",
    ", we try to solve the equation @xmath395 with the ansatz @xmath396 substitution in the equation for @xmath323 yields the relations @xmath397 the first equation has a static equilibrium at @xmath398 , which is unstable for @xmath399 and stable for @xmath400",
    ". one can show that the solution of with initial condition @xmath401 tracks the branch @xmath402 at a distance at most @xmath184 , for both negative and positive times .",
    "the second equation has a more subtle behaviour .",
    "it admits an equilibrium branch at @xmath403 , which is stable for @xmath399 and unstable for @xmath400 ; in fact , it undergoes hopf bifurcation .",
    "such bifurcations have been studied by neishtadt @xcite .",
    "the interesting fact is that there exist solutions tracking the equilibrium branch beyond the bifurcation point , but only until a time called or .",
    "this point is obtained in the following way : let @xmath404 be the linearization of around the equilibrium @xmath405 . define the function @xmath406 the buffer time @xmath407 is the largest real time which can be connected to the negative real axis by a path of constant @xmath408 ( and with some additional properties given in @xcite ) . in the present situation , @xmath409 ( a ) . as a consequence , for @xmath410",
    ", we can construct a solution of which is close to @xmath405 , and the evolution operator of is given by @xmath411 for @xmath412 , however , the solution @xmath413 necessarily admits a discontinuity of order @xmath414 at the buffer time",
    ". a similar calculation as in the previous subsection yields the evolution operator @xmath415 if the system starts away from the origin at @xmath416 , it will follow the origin exponentially closely until a delay time @xmath273 , which is the first time at which one of the matrix elements becomes of order @xmath32 again . if @xmath51 , we simply have @xmath417 .",
    "when @xmath418 , however , we can not overlook the interaction between the overdamped and the oscillating mode , which takes effectively place at the buffer time @xmath409 , and may cause the system to become unstable at an earlier time . for instance ,",
    "when @xmath419 , the usual delay time for @xmath51 would be @xmath420 , while the effective delay time for @xmath421 is @xmath422 ( b ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon is observed for the kobayashi equations , only with different values of the cruising , buffer and delay times .",
    "the effective value of the bifurcation delay can be shown to depend at leading order in @xmath4 only on the linearization around the origin .",
    "it is important , together with nonlinear terms , for the global structure of motion , since it influences the choice of the asymmetric equilibrium the system follows after leaving the origin .",
    "in fact , for large amplitude oscillations of the form @xmath423 , we observed numerically that the kobayashi equations display chaotic hysteresis just as the rotating pendulum in section [ sec_rp ] .",
    "this is not really surprising , since even when @xmath51 , each oscillator is similar to the rotating pendulum of the amplitude of @xmath42 is large enough .",
    "a positive @xmath89 , however , will modify the bifurcation delay and the dynamic phases and amplitudes which determine the structure of the poincar map .",
