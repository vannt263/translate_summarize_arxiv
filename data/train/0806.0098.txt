    "the decoherence of a center spin in a spin bath@xcite has been of interest in spin resonance spectroscopy for a long historykubo1954_jpsj , pines1955,feher1959,klauder1962 and is also a paradigmatic model in studying the state collapse in quantum mechanics .",
    "recent revisited interest in this problem is mostly due to the decoherence issue in quantum computing.@xcite most relevant are single electron spins in quantum dots or impurity centers where the dominating decoherence mechanism at low temperatures ( such as below a few kelvins ) is the nuclear spins of the host lattice.@xcite in a small system such as a quantum dot , the center spin ( hereafter referred to as qubit for clarity ) and the spin bath , in the time - scale of decoherence , is a relatively isolated subsystem in the whole environment .",
    "thus the qubit decoherence is due to the entanglement with the bath during the coherent evolution of the whole system.@xcite    in this paper , we are interested in the so - called pure dephasing in which the qubit experiences no longitudinal relaxation but only loses its off - diagonal phase coherence .",
    "the pure dephasing is relevant to an electron spin under a moderate or strong magnetic field ( @xmath0  t for a typical gaas dot ) , where the electron spin flip due to the hyperfine interaction is largely suppressed by the zeeman energy mismatch between the electron and the nuclei . in the absence of qubit flip ,",
    "a qubit - bath system has a hamiltonian as @xmath1 by which the spin bath is driven by different hamiltonians @xmath2 depending on the qubit states @xmath3 .",
    "when a coherent qubit state @xmath4 is prepared , the initial state of the qubit - bath system is the product state @xmath5 . at time @xmath6",
    ", the bath evolution @xmath7 predicated on the qubit state @xmath8 establishes an entangled state @xmath9 .",
    "the qubit coherence is reduced from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the decoherence is characterized by the bath state overlap @xmath12 .",
    "thus the key is the many - body bath dynamics caused by the interaction within the bath . without many - body interactions , the bath would not evolve ( except for a trivial phase factor that can be eliminated by standard spin - echo@xcite ) and the qubit coherence would not decay .    recently , a variety of quantum many - body theories for nuclear spin bath dynamics have been developed including the density matrix cluster expansion ( ce),@xcite the pair - correlation approximation,@xcite and the linked - cluster expansion ( lce).@xcite in the pair - correlation approximation , each pair - wise flip - flop of nuclear spins is identified as an elementary excitation mode and is taken as independent of each other . to study the higher oder correlations , the feynman diagram lce is developed .",
    "the evaluation of higher - order lce , however , is rather tedious due to the increasing number of diagrams , especially for spins higher than 1/2 ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "the density matrix ce is developed in the spirit of the standard cluster expansion or virial expansion for interacting gases in grand canonical ensembles.@xcite it serves as a simple method ( without the need to count or evaluate feynman diagrams ) to include the higher - order spin interaction effects beyond the pair - correlation approximation .",
    "the ce calculations show that when the pair - correlation contribution to the decoherence is suppressed by pulse control,@xcite the higher - order correlations are not negligible.@xcite in order to obtain the decoherence exponent from the ce , however , the terms involving overlapping clusters have to be neglected , which make the accuracy problematic even when the expansion converges .",
    "this problem limits the ce to applications in large baths in which the contribution of each individual cluster to the decoherence is small and the overlapping correction is unimportant .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a cluster - correlation expansion ( cce ) method in which the bath spin evolution are factorized into cluster correlations .",
    "each cluster correlation term is equivalent to the sum of all the lce seriessaikin2007 consisting of a given set of bath spins flip - flopped . in particular , the two - spin cluster correlations include all diagrams with two spins flip - flopped and is equivalent to the pair - correlation approximation.@xcite the cce bears the accuracy of the lce ( the results are accurate whenever converge ) and the simplicity of the ce ( without the need to count or evaluate feynman diagrams ) , while free from the large - bath restriction of the ce .",
    "the cce coincides with the ce in the leading order of the short - time expansion , which is applicable in large spin baths where the decoherence completes well within the bath spin flip - flop time . for small baths , however",
    ", the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin flip - flop time and individual higher - order cluster correlations could grow significant . in this case",
    "only the cce converges to the exact coherent dynamics of multi - spin clusters .",
    "such coherent dynamics of small clusters of bath spins is of special interest in systems with randomized qubit - bath couplings .",
    "an interesting example is nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamondsjelezko2004_prlnv , childress2006_sciencenv , dutt2007_sciencenv , hanson2008_sciencenv which are coupled to randomly located bath spins ( carbon-13 and nitrogen nuclear spins ) in the proximity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive , for a generic spin bath hamiltonian , the cce from a recursive cluster factorization procedure .",
    "we show that the cce is equivalent to an infinite resummation of the lce series and also compare it to the ce . in section iii",
