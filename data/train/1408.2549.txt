    "in heavy - ion collisions , initial geometric quantities such as impact parameter and shape of the collision region can not be directly determined experimentally .",
    "however , it is possible to relate the number of observed particles and number of spectator neutrons to the centrality of the collision . using the percentile centrality of a collision",
    ", the initial geometric configuration can be estimated with models assuming the configuration nuclei from nucleons and the collision process of two nuclei .",
    "these models fall in two main classes .",

    "a smooth matter density is assumed , typically described by a fermi distribution in the radial direction and uniform over solid angle . in the monte carlo  ( mc ) based models , individual nucleons",
    "are stochastically distributed event - by - event and collision properties are calculated by averaging over multiple events . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , the two type of models lead to mostly similar results for simple quantities such as the number of participating nucleons  ( @xmath0 ) and impact parameters  ( @xmath1 ) , but give different results in quantities where event - by - event fluctuations are significant , such as participant frame eccentricity  ( @xmath2 ) .    in this paper , we discuss several improvements of the monte carlo glauber calculation originally implemented by the phobos collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the main improvement w.r.t .",
    "the earlier version ( v1 ) are the inclusion of tritium , helium-3 , and uranium , as well as the treatment of deformed nuclei and glauber - gribov fluctuations of the proton in p+a collisions .",

    "the mc glauber model calculation is performed in two steps .",
    "first , the nucleon positions in each nucleus are stochastically determined .",
    "then , the two nuclei are `` collided '' , assuming the nucleons travel in a straight line along the beam axis ( eikonal approximation ) such that nucleons are tagged as wounded  ( participating ) or spectator .",
    "the position of each nucleon in the nucleus is determined according to a probability density function . in a quantum mechanical picture ,",
    "the probability density function can be thought of as the single - particle probability density and the position as the result of a position measurement . in the context of the mc glauber model ,",
    "one commonly requires a minimum inter - nucleon separation  ( @xmath3 ) between the centers of the nucleons for the determination of the nucleon positions inside a given nucleus .    the probability distribution for spherical nuclei is taken to be uniform in azimuthal and polar angles .",
    "the radial probability function is modeled from nuclear charge densities extracted in low - energy electron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear charge density is usually parameterized by a fermi distribution with three parameters @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the nucleon density , @xmath6 is the nuclear radius , @xmath7 is the skin depth and @xmath8 corresponds to deviations from a spherical shape .",

    "the configurations were computed ( and stored in a database ) from green s function mc calculations using the av18 + uix model interactions , which correctly sample the position of the three nucleons , including correlations , as in ref .",
    "finally , note that we also provide the rescaled values for the radius and skin depth of cu  ( `` cuhn '' ) , au  ( `` auhn '' ) and pb  ( `` pbhn '' ) to take into account the finite nucleon profile as derived in @xcite and @xcite .",
