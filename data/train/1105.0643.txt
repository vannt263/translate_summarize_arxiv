    "the interest in the latter has to do with the fact that such metrics often represent kinetic energies as in the case of hydrodynamics , see e.g. , @xcite , or arise naturally in probability and optimal transport problems with quadratic cost functions ( such as the wasserstein or kantorovich - rubinstein distance ) ; see e.g. , @xcite",

    "<S> we study the geometry of the space of densities @xmath0 , which is the quotient space @xmath1 of the diffeomorphism group of a compact manifold @xmath2 by the subgroup of volume - preserving diffemorphisms , endowed with a right - invariant homogeneous sobolev @xmath3-metric . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an explicit isometry from this space to ( a subset of ) an infinite - dimensional sphere and show that the associated euler - arnold equation is a completely integrable system in any space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that its smooth solutions break down in finite time .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the @xmath3-metric induces the fisher - rao ( information ) metric on the space of probability distributions , and thus its riemannian distance is the spherical version of hellinger distance . </S>",
    "<S> we compare it to the wasserstein distance in optimal transport which is induced by an @xmath4-metric on @xmath5 . </S>",
