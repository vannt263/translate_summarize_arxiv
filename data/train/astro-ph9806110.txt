    "the discovery of the afterglows of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ; costa , 1997 ; van paradijs , 1997 ; frail , 1997 ) and the disappearance of flares in their radio flux ( goodman 1997 ) have provided strong evidence in favor of the fireball model ( rees and mszros 1992 ) , whereby mass is ejected from an as yet unknown source with large lorenz factors , @xmath1 .",
    "several authors have pointed out that in the extremely energetic events giving rise to these hyperrelativistic flows , high energy neutrinos are likely to be produced .",
    "a first likely source is the merger of the two neutron stars which may ( narayan , paczynski and piran 1992 ) give rise to the bursts themselves , as originally suggested by eichler ( 1989 ) . although insufficient to power the burst itself ( janka and ruffert 1996 ) , this may yet provide a copious source of low energy neutrinos , @xmath2 .",
    "another source of neutrinos comes from @xmath3 collisions inside the shocks which give rise to the observed burst proper ( paczynski and xu 1994 ) ; although it seems unlikely that these collisions may give rise to the burst itself , yet they may originate a flux of higher energy neutrinos , @xmath4 , which is however currently unobservable ( ostrowski and zdziarski 1995 ) .    a third , distinct source of high energy neutrinos exists .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that gamma ray bursts may be responsible for the acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays observed so far ( vietri 1995 , waxman 1995 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( waxman and bahcall 1997 ) that these uhecrs may produce neutrinos through pion photoproduction , , through the reaction @xmath5 inside the burst itself , , against the @xmath6ray photons of the burst . while the probability of this happening is not large ( vietri 1995 ) , yet waxman and bahcall ( 1997 ) pointed out that significant amounts of neutrinos with energy @xmath7 ought to be produced , and might be revealed by detectors of the amanda class .",
    "this detection is however made difficult by the fact that the earth becomes opaque for this neutrino energy , so that the technique employing upward  moving muons can not be used .",
    "but , through the same mechanism , and simultaneously with these lower energy brethrens , neutrinos in the energy range @xmath8 ( uhens = ultra high energy neutrinos ) ought to be produced ; in vietri ( 1998 , paper i from now on ) i showed that a significant fraction ( @xmath9 ) of all energy initially released in uhecrs ought to be lost to neutrinos emitted during the burst proper , or during the first week of the burst afterglow .",
    "the interesting point of this computation is that it appears that the next generation of satellite  borne detectors of large showers , such as airwatch ( linsley 1997 ) may cover an area large enough to allow detection of uhens within the first year or so of operation .    shortly before paper",
    "i was accepted , rachen and mszros ( 1998 ) have presented a detailed analysis of losses limiting neutrinos energies , in the _ internal _ shock scenario for grbs , which applies for instance to the model of waxman and bahcall ( 1997 ) .",
    "they conclude that these losses severely limit both the energies of individual neutrinos , and the total energy released by gamma ray bursts .",
    "such losses arise because both the photoproduced pions , and the muons generated by the pion decay , before decaying suffer adiabatic and synchrotron losses , thusly imparting to neutrinos less than the energy they started out with . given the short rest lifetimes of pions and muons , one maybe inclined to think these losses at all negligible , but , because of relativistic time ",
    "dilation , pions and muons moving with a lorenz factor typical of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( @xmath10 ) may survive more than @xmath11 , and cover sizeable distances ( @xmath12 ) in the meantime .",
    "it is the purpose of this _ letter _ to carry out the analysis of losses for _ external _ shocks , both during the burst proper and in the afterglow phase .",
    "it will be concluded that in the relatively tame environments generated by external shocks , neutrinos produced by pion decay are unaffected by losses , while neutrinos produced by muon decay are limited in energy by these processes , but still manage to exceed @xmath0 .",
    "the major departure from the discussion in paper i is due to the sensational discovery ( kulkarni , 1998 ) of the redshift @xmath13 for the burst grb 971214 .",
    "this discovery forces us to choose different scaling values for bursts , for the following reason .",
    "for cosmological parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the luminosity distance to this redshift is @xmath16 ; for @xmath17 it would be @xmath18 .",
    "the burst as observed by the bepposax grbm had a peak luminosity of @xmath19 , and a total duration of @xmath20 ( heise , 1997 ) , corresponding to a fluence of @xmath21 . with the lower , above  stated luminosity distance this converts to a total energy release of @xmath22 , roughly the binding energy of two merging neutron stars .",
    "while strictly speaking still not an impossibility , these values seem to imply some beaming , a natural consequence of many grbs models .",
    "in fact , assuming a beaming factor @xmath23 , the total energy release becomes a more mundane @xmath24 .",
    "similar , although less extreme values have been derived , less cogently , for the burst grb 970508 ( panaitescu , mszros and rees 1998 ) .",
    "these values will be adopted here .",
    "before considering losses , i need to establish some properties of the environment , within the fireball theory of gamma ray bursts . the maximum proton energy , in the observer frame ,",
    "was shown to be ( vietri 1995 ) @xmath25 where the ejecta shell has , at the moment of impacting with the interstellar medium of density @xmath26 , a lorenz factor @xmath27 , the shell explosion energy is @xmath28 , @xmath29 the beaming angle , and @xmath30 is the magnetic field energy density in units of the equipartition magnetic field energy density .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , this corrects a small error of vietri ( 1995 ) .",
    "when seen from the shell , this highest energy proton will have a lorenz factor @xmath31 given by @xmath32 the two equations above correspond to equations 29 and 28 , respectively , of vietri ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is perhaps useful to remind the reader that they were obtained under the assumption that the major limiting factor of the protons energies comes from the finite shell thickness : whenever the proton energy increases so much that @xmath33 times its larmor radius @xmath34 exceeds the shell thickness , the proton will cross the whole shell without being deflected backwards , and the acceleration cycle stops . here , the magnetic field is assumed to be a fraction @xmath35 of its equipartition value , and the value @xmath36 is taken from the numerical simulations of quenby and lieu ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , at the referee s prompting , i can also show that the acceleration time ",
    "scale is shorter than the shell light  crossing time , which is the time",
    " scale on which adiabatic losses set in , and also the time ",
    "scale on which the highest energy protons cross the shell before being deflected backwards . by establishing this",
    ", i shall in fact demonstrate that the two above equations correctly describe the highest proton energies achievable . the acceleration time ",
    "scale at relativistic shocks @xmath37 is shorter by a factor @xmath38 than the traditional acceleration time ",
    "scale at non  relativistic shocks ( quenby and lieu 1989 ) ; thus @xmath39 here matter on the two sides of the shocks moves with speeds @xmath40 with respect to the stationary shock , @xmath41 is the typical deflection length , @xmath42 is the injection momentum , and @xmath43 the highest achievable momentum in the shock frame . since @xmath44 , i find @xmath45 specializing now to a relativistic flow , for which @xmath46 , and also @xmath47 , i obtain @xmath48 on the other hand , for the highest energy protons , we have set , in deriving eq .",
    "[ highest ] , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the shell thickness ; inserting this into the above equation , i find @xmath51 which is as long as the shell light crossing time .",
    "so the acceleration is prompt enough to propel protons to the highest energies computed in eq .",
    "[ highest ] , within the time ",
    "scale @xmath52 , which is approximately the whole time the proton spends inside the shell , before reaching an energy so large that it can not be turned backwards .",
    "furthermore , proton adiabatic losses also become appreciable on the shell expansion timescale ( rachen and mszros 1998 ) @xmath52 , longer than the acceleration timescale eq .",
    "[ acctime ] .",
    "it should be noticed that this result is independent of the specific values of @xmath33 assumed ; nor does it depend upon the magnetic field having achieved or not its equipartition value .",
    "it is only the highest proton energy which depends on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath30 . nor",
    "does it depend explicitly upon the shock lorenz factor , provided the shock is relativistic of course .",
    "this is especially important when one considers the application of this same idea to the bursts afterglows : the maximum proton energy is again provided by the finite shell thickness , which however , following eq .",
    "[ highest ] , changes as the shell slows down .",
    "the reason for the continuing applicability of eq .",
    "[ highest ] is that , even during the afterglow , the shell thickness is given , in the shell frame , by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the current shock position , exactly as during the burst proper ( mszros , laguna and rees 1994 ) .",
    "this result can be phrased as follows : as the shock decelerates , the acceleration time ",
    "scale becomes longer , but so does also the shell crossing time and , provided the magnetic field builds up to the same , constant , fraction of the equipartition value @xmath30 , the two time ",
    "scales lengthen by the same amount , thus keeping the result of eq .",
    "[ acctime ] still valid .",
    "the only hidden hypothesis in this argument is that appreciable magnetic fields exist on both sides of the shock to deflect the cosmic rays ; in vietri ( 1995 ) i suggested that this occurs when two or more shells collide .",
    "i believe the same suggestion is still valid for afterglows ; i shall however discuss the implications of these multiple collisions in a different paper .",
    "lastly i should remark that the results discussed in this section do depend upon the correctness of the assumption made by quenby and lieu ( 1989 ) that scattering of high energy protons at relativistic shocks is isotropic , and large  pitch angle . since this provides a satisfactory explanation for the acceleration of cosmic rays at agns ( quenby and lieu 1989 ) , and it is borne out by theoretical arguments and simulations of interplanetary shocks ( moussas , quenby and valdes  galicia 1982 , 1987 ) , it seems quite a plausible assumption to make .",
    "the equations [ highest ] and [ gammap ] are however in an inconvenient form , the reason being that the parameter @xmath55 is unobservable .",
    "it is expedient to substitute for it the burst duration @xmath56 , a directly observed quantity which is related to it by the following argument .",
    "the shock with the interstellar medium forms at a distance @xmath57 from the explosion site , where ( mszros , laguna and rees 1993 ) @xmath58 while the burst duration is of order @xmath59 this is an old argument , originally due to ruderman ( 1975 ) , and more recently discussed by sari and piran ( 1997 ) . eliminating @xmath57 from the above",
    "i find @xmath60 and @xmath61 the magnetic field behind the shock , in the shell frame , is often assumed ( mszros , laguna and rees 1993 ) to be some fixed fraction @xmath35 of its equipartion value @xmath62 , and is given by @xmath63 where i have of course used eq .",
    "it is also convenient to rewrite eq.[gammap ] , again using eq .",
    "[ n1 ] , as @xmath64 and eq . [ highest ] as @xmath65",
    "i have established above that protons suffer no adiabatic losses during their acceleration ; in vietri ( 1995 ) i had shown that also synchrotron and photopion losses are negligible . in vietri ( 1998 )",
    "i showed that the small photopion production leads , through the decays of eq . 1 , to the production of a small , but significant flux of prompt neutrinos .",
    "however , rachen and mszros ( 1998 ) have shown that one ought to consider carefully whether synchrotron and adiabatic losses by muons and pions before their decay may significantly limit neutrinos energies .",
    "the most significant losses will be due to muons , because of their longer lifetime ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) .",
    "the maximum muon lorenz factor @xmath68 before significant adiabatic losses set in is given by the following argument .",
    "a muon moving with lorenz factor @xmath6 in the shell frame appears to have a lifetime @xmath69 , because of relativistic time dilation . within this time ,",
    "the shell is expanding , thusly allowing the comoving magnetic field to decrease on a time ",
    "scale @xmath70 .",
    "the shell typical size @xmath50 in the shell frame is @xmath71 ( mszros , laguna and rees 1993 ) , where @xmath54 is the shock instantaneous distance from the origin of the explosion ; at the moment of the burst @xmath72 ( eq . [ rshock ] ) .",
    "the shell expansion velocity @xmath73 .",
    "the limiting lorenz factor @xmath68 is found by equating these two time ",
    "scales : @xmath74 the condition that neutrino production is not affected , @xmath75 , can be expressed as a requirement on the burst parameters : i obtain @xmath76 for pion adiabatic losses , the only change comes in because of its shorter lifetime : @xmath77    synchrotron losses by muons are related to those of protons as follows .",
    "calling @xmath78 the lifetime against synchrotron losses for a proton of lorenz factor @xmath6 , the largest muon lorenz factor @xmath68 before significant losses set in is given by ( rachen and mszros 1998 ) @xmath79 here the muon mass is @xmath80 .",
    "i find , using eq .",
    "[ bequi ] , @xmath81 again , the condition that these losses are irrelevant , @xmath75 , can be rewritten as a requirement on the burst parameters : i find @xmath82 for pions the relevant criterion is @xmath83    it is convenient to remark here that the use of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as independent burst parameters allows discussion of afterglow with the same formulae . during afterglows , the quantity @xmath85 loses meaning because the afterglow emission is of course continuous . however , let us still define , by analogy with eq .",
    "[ duration ] , @xmath86 , where @xmath54 and @xmath84 are the instantaneous shock position and lorenz factor . during the afterglow , for adiabatic expansion the shell lorenz factor decreases as @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the variation of @xmath85 parametrizes the shell radius .",
    "i find that @xmath88 describes the further evolution of the shell . here",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are the initial values of the afterglow , at the moment of the formation of the external shock .",
    "this equation can also be established , for an adiabatic expansion in a constant density environment , by imposing the constancy through the afterglow of eq .",
    "it is also identical to the time evolution law for adiabatic expansion with respect to observer s time , so that the fictitious quantity @xmath85 can also be identified with earth time , a physical quantity . in other words , by considering arbitrary values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , i am considering points which do not really model any known burst , but which parametrize correctly later , afterglow moments of realistic bursts ; the realistic initial models are linked to later values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 by eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] .",
    "first i consider neutrinos produced directly by charged pion decay . in fig .",
    "1 i show the constraints eq .",
    "[ firstpion ] and [ secondpion ] for @xmath91 , plotted as solid lines .",
    "the dashed lines represent the afterglow evolution tracks , eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] .",
    "the figure covers roughly the first three afterglow hours .",
    "the dotted lines represent the loci of points of constant highest neutrino energies : when losses are negligible , these are computed multiplying highestproton energies , eq . [ high2 ] , by @xmath92 .",
    "neutrinos produced directly by charged pion decay will not be limited by the rather more stringent requirements on muon losses , eq . [ first ] .",
    "this means that , should a burst fail to produce high energy neutrinos from muon decay , its neutrino flux will only be decreased ( roughly ) by a factor of 3 because the two neutrinos from the muon decay will be lost , at the same energy level .",
    "it can easily be seen from fig .",
    "1 that neutrinos of energy as large as @xmath93 may be produced .",
    "muon  produced neutrinos will be limited in energy both by synchrotron losses and by adiabatic losses , depending exactly on the model parameter values .",
    "the cross  over occurs when eq .",
    "[ adiabatic ] equals eq .",
    "[ synchro ] , , for @xmath94 with adiabatic losses dominating whenever @xmath95 .",
    "when synchrotron losses dominate we see by comparing eq .",
    "[ synchro ] with eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] that afterglow evolution occurs along lines of ( roughly ! ) constant @xmath68 in the shell frame , so that the maximum achievable energy in the observer frame is given by @xmath96 times eq .",
    "[ synchro ] . multiplying times the typical energy of outgoing neutrinos",
    ", @xmath97 we find that the neutrino energy is @xmath98 taking into account that during afterglow the shell lorenz factor varies according to eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] , the typical neutrino energy is given by inserting this into the above equation : @xmath99 where of course @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the initial lorenz factor and burst duration in units of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , and the result is independent of post  burst time .",
    "since the dependence on the initial parameter is so steep , it is enough that @xmath100 exceeds unity by a factor of @xmath104 for @xmath105 to exceed @xmath93 .",
    "when adiabatic losses dominate , the limiting muon lorenz factor in the observer frame is given by @xmath106 .",
    "the locus of constant @xmath107 is thus parallel to the top solid line of fig .",
    "1 ( eq . [ first ] ) , and to eq .",
    "[ high2 ] .",
    "this gives a typical neutrino energy of @xmath108 however , afterglow evolution ( eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] ) is shallower than either of these ; thus during the afterglow the energy of neutrinos produced becomes higher ; this can be checked by computing the highest @xmath107 for the afterglow evolution , eq .",
    "[ afterglow ] : i find @xmath109 .",
    "the normalization is such that the highest neutrino energy occurs on the top solid line of fig .",
    "1 : inserting eq . [ first ] into eq .",
    "[ high2 ] , and considering that typical neutrinos carry away @xmath92 of the proton energy i find @xmath110    in fig .",
    "2 i show as dashed lines tracks of constant energy for neutrinos produced by muon decay only , in the observer frame , together with the previously defined afterglow tracks ( eq . [ afterglow ] , again dashed lines ) . the bottom solid line , eq .",
    "[ crossover ] , marks the boundary between the region where adiabatic losses ( above ) and that where synchrotron losses dominate ( below ) .",
    "the top solid line marks the region ( below the line ) where adiabatic muon losses limit neutrinos energies . at fixed @xmath111 ,",
    "the neutrino energy is not monotonic with @xmath112 because , above the region where adiabatic losses operate , each neutrino carries away a fraction @xmath113 of the emitting proton energy , which is a decreasing function of @xmath112 , for fixed @xmath55 ( eq . [ high2 ] ) . in either case , , synchrotron or adiabatic losses",
    ", we see that it is still possible to produce high energy neutrinos , of order @xmath93 .    in paper",
    "i , i showed that the fraction @xmath114 of the photon luminosity @xmath115 that goes into neutrinos is @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the typical burst observed spectral turnover energy .",
    "the important parameter @xmath118 and its time  dependence during the afterglow are not currently observed , nor are they in any way predicted by theory . a simple argument allowed to state that ,",
    "if @xmath118 scales with the shell lorenz factor @xmath84 as @xmath119 with @xmath120 , then @xmath114 remains constant or grows through the afterglow ; if @xmath114 remains constant , then the neutrino luminosity @xmath121 , the last proportionality being observed ( fruchter , 1997 ) .",
    "thus , even the bursts which , initially , suffer important muon losses , during the afterglow become effective neutrino emitters and , given that the neutrino luminosity scales only with @xmath122 , the total neutrino fluence will not be much reduced by losses .",
    "the reason why i find now that , initially , losses are important is that , when i assume a significant amount of beaming , the maximum proton lorenz factor , eq .",
    "[ gammamax ] , is greatly increased , while the maximum muon lorenz factor , eq .",
    "[ adiabatic ] for adiabatic losses , or eq .",
    "[ synchro ] for synchrotron losses , is reduced or at most remains constant ; it can be seen that in the isotropic case assumed in paper i the requirement on losses would have been less severe ; however , as a partial compensation , for same total energy but significant beaming the maximum proton energy in the observer frame also increases , so that the end result is that , losses or not , neutrinos with energies exceeding @xmath123 are emitted .",
    "the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays in intergalactic space is significantly limited by energy degradation via pion photoproduction off the cmbr photons ( greisen 1966 , zatsepin and kuzmin 1966 ) .",
    "however , it has long been recognized ( wdowczyk , tkaczyk and wolfendale 1972 ) that observations of high energy neutrinos , thanks to their negligible cross sections for interaction with matter and photons , will eventually allow us to investigate the sources of cosmic rays way beyond this limit . with the development of airwatch  class experiments ( linsley 1997 ) , capable of monitoring from space atmospheric areas of order @xmath124 in the search for extended air showers , and with detection efficiencies close to @xmath125 for neutrinos ( l. scarsi , private communication ) , it seems the time for extending our search for sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays to the whole universe has come .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , as already noted in paper i , the generic neutrinos ( , those produced by cosmic rays which managed to escape unscathed from their sources , but which produce pions off cmbr photons ) should display dipole and quadrupole moments which , if uhens come from grbs , should be totally negligible ( fishman and meegan 1995 ) . this by itself may help rule out / establish an important alternative idea , that uhecrs have an origin in the local supercluster ( stanev , 1995 ) .",
    "second , the expected neutrino fluxes computed by yoshida and teshima ( 1993 ) for cosmologically distributed sources , leading to expected event rates for airwatch  class experiments of @xmath126 , may be a significant underestimate .",
    "in fact , they assumed a distribution of sources of uhecrs arbitrarily limited to a redshift @xmath127 .",
    "however , the recent , sensational identification of a redshift @xmath13 for the burst grb 971214 ( kulkarni , 1998 ) makes it clear that significant fluxes of ultra high energy neutrinos may be at very large redshifts , thus not violating the constraints on fluxes of uhecrs observed at earth .",
    "thus the building of airwatch  type experiments with significant neutrino ",
    "detection capabilities becomes an even more exciting prospect .    in this paper ,",
    "i have strengthened the point made in paper i that a fraction @xmath9 of all ultra high energy neutrinos should correlate ( within about a week ) with the burst where it was emitted , by showing in some detail that losses do not inhibit the production of high energy ( @xmath128 ) neutrinos , simultaneously with the burst or its afterglow .",
    "a search for ultra high energy neutrinos ought to be a significant test of the hypothesis that uhecrs are generated in grbs .",
