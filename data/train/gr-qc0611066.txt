    "one of the notable feature of quantum fields in curved spacetime is that quantum processes prohibited in the minkowski spacetime is allowed @xcite . for example",
    ", the emission of a photon from a moving massive charged particle occurs in an expanding universe , though such a process is prohibited by the energy momentum conservation in the minkowski spacetime due to the lorentz invariance .",
    "this subject was studied by several authors : pioneering work was done by buchbinder and tsaregorodtsev @xcite and by lotze@xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the transition probability of the process by applying qed to a radiation - dominated universe . then futamase et al . and hotta et al . considered the case of a simple background spacetime with a sudden transition of the scale factor @xcite .",
    "these previous works , however , focused on the transition probability of the process . while , in the present paper , we calculate the radiation energy emitted through the process .",
    "our point of view is as follows : the motion of a massive charge in an expanding or contracting universe can be regarded as an accelerated motion , because the physical momentum of the particle decreases ( increased ) as the universe expands ( contracts ) .",
    "then , the photon emission process can be regarded as the well - known classical radiation process from an accelerated charge @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims to clarify the correspondence between the classical and quantum approaches to photon emission from a moving charge in expanding universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the scalar qed model in the friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "then , we show that the classical radiation formula , which corresponds to the larmor formula for the rate of the radiation energy from an accelerated charge , is derived under the wkb approximation in the framework of quantum field theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze the scalar qed model without wkb approximation in two different universe models .",
    "we first consider a universe which undergoes a bounce and is radiation - dominated at asymptotic past and future infinity .",
    "the advantage of this model is that the equation of motion of a free complex scalar field is exactly solvable .",
    "then , the radiation energy through the photon emission process is numerically computed .",
    "the result is compared with the corresponding result based on the wkb formula , and the condition for the validity of the wkb formula is found .",
    "second , we consider the case of a bounced milne universe , to verify the robustness of the result .",
    "the last section is devoted to the summary and conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the unit light velocity equals @xmath0 .",
    "we follow the convention @xmath1 .",
    "in what follows , we focus on the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime , whose line element is expressed as @xmath2=a(\\eta)^2\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu , \\label{lineelement}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the conformal time , and @xmath4 is the scale factor .",

    "thus the system is mathematically equivalent to the scalar qed in the minkowski spacetime with the time - variable mass @xmath13 .",
    "we follow a general prescription for interacting fields , based on the interaction picture approach ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this result is consistent with that in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is obtained from consideration of the classical electromagnetic radiation formula of a moving charge in an expanding universe .",
    "finally in this section , let us summarize the necessary condition for reproducing the radiation formula in the classical electromagnetic theory .",
    "we started with the wkb formula of the mode function , for which eq .",
    "( [ wkbcondition ] ) is needed .",
    "in addition , we assumed eq .",
    "( [ classicalpic ] ) .",
    "although this condition is independent of the necessary condition for the wkb approximation , eq .",
    "( [ wkbcondition ] ) , we assumed it because this additional assumption is necessary to recover the conventional picture for the classical radiation from a charged massive particle , in which the massive field should behave like a particle and the photon field should behave like a wave .",
    "in this section , we calculate the radiated energy without the wkb approximation . we start with reviewing the formalism .",
    "now we return to the s - matrix expression  ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of the quantum field theory in curved spacetime is that vacuum state may not be stable .",
    "namely , the vacuum state may change , and the particle creation phenomenon can occur .",
    "this vacuum effect is not taken into account in the analysis based on the wkb approximation in the previous section . in this section ,",
    "we adopt the formalism for evaluating the s - matrix element , taking the vacuum effect into account .    for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the interaction is switched off in the asymptotic past infinity ( @xmath78 ) and future infinity ( @xmath79 ) , where the different vacuum states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , are defined for the free field .",
    "then , similar to eq .",
    "( [ complexscalar ] ) , we may write the quantized field as @xmath82 or as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 are the annihilation and the creation operators , respectively , with respect to the in - vacuum at @xmath78 , while @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 are those with respect to the out - vacuum at @xmath79 .",
    "the in - vacuum and out - vacuum states are expressed as @xmath92 and @xmath93 for any @xmath94 .",
    "these annihilation and the creation operators satisfy the same commutation relations as eq .",
    "( [ commutationrelation ] ) .    in eqs .",
    "( [ phiin ] ) and ( [ phiout ] ) , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the mode functions with respect to the vacuum states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "they are related by the bogoliubov transformation , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath100 the creation and annihilation operators are related as @xmath101 using the above relations , we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 as for the photon field , because of its conformal invariance , the vacuum state is invariant in time , @xmath104 .",
    "the transition amplitude in the lowest order of @xmath105 is evaluated in the similar form as eq .",
    "( [ transitionamplitude ] ) , but with @xmath106 in the computation of the transition amplitude , it is necessary to regularize the divergence arising from the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude . in the flat background , this can be done unambiguously by taking the normal - order product of operators . however , in a curved spacetime , there arises ambiguity because the in - state annihilation / creation operators are different from the out - state annihilation / creation operators .",
    "in fact , there will be particle creation from vacuum and the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude will not longer be unity any more .    to deal with this situation properly",
    ", we consider the _",
    "generalized normal product _ of operators , which is defined as the form where the operators are expressed only in terms of the in - state annihilation operator and the out - state creation operators , and all the out - state creation operator are placed to the left of all the in - state annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "this is adopted in ref .",
    "the nice properties of this generalized normal ordering are that it is symmetrically defined with respect to the in - state and out - state operators , and that the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude is normalized to unity .",
    "in particular , this latter property means that it minimizes the effect of particle creation from vacuum . since what we are interested in is not the vacuum particle creation but the transition amplitude for a massive particle to radiate under the electromagnetic interaction , we adopt the generalized normal ordering to regularize the divergence .",
    "we note that what would be actually observed will be inevitably contaminated by the effect of particle creation .",
    "however , whether there is a way to separate out this vacuum effect observationally is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we define @xmath107|{\\rm i}\\big>_{\\rm in } }    \\over \\displaystyle{{}_{\\rm out}\\bigl<0|0\\big>_{\\rm in}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , @xmath110 $ ] denotes the generalized normal product of the s - matrix , and @xmath111 is the vacuum to vacuum amplitude .",
    "we then find the formula for the radiation energy as @xmath112     as function of @xmath113 with fixed as @xmath114 , from top to bottom .",
    "the solid curve is exact , eq .",

    ", width=336 ]      in this subsection , we consider a time - symmetric bounce universe which asymptotically approaches a contracting and expanding radiation - dominated universe ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the scale factor is given in terms of the conformal time @xmath3 by @xcite @xmath117 which recovers a radiation - dominated friedmann universe in the asymptotic regions , @xmath118 .",
    "in this background spacetime , the wkb formula ( [ fene ] ) gives @xmath119    equation of motion ( [ equationofmotion ] ) is reduced to the weber s differential equation @xmath120 where @xmath121 therefore , the mode functions are constructed as @xcite @xmath122 with @xmath123 using the mathematical formula for the parabolic cylinder function , @xmath124 we easily find the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath125    using the mathematical formula for the parabolic cylinder function @xcite , @xmath126 \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\times     u\\bigl(i\\alpha , 1+i(\\alpha-\\beta ) ,       -i{\\rho^2\\over 2}\\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have @xmath127       \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\hspace{40mm}\\times u\\bigl(i\\lambda+{1\\over 2 } , 1+(\\lambda-\\bar\\lambda ) ,      -i{k^2\\over 2m\\alphaa/\\hbar}\\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the second order confluent hypergeometric function @xcite , and we used the notation @xmath129    then , the radiation energy @xmath130 is represented by @xmath131 where @xmath132 and we have defined @xmath133 .",
    "note that the function @xmath134 describes the deviation from the wkb formula .",
    "now let us consider the classical limit by taking the limit @xmath135 .",
    "we use the mathematical formula @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the modified bessel function .",
    "then , we have @xmath138 with @xmath139 we have evaluated the function @xmath134 numerically .",
    "the cases of @xmath116 and @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in all cases we analyzed , we found @xmath134 is a decreasing function of @xmath140 .    in the limit @xmath135",
    ", @xmath141 then , we have @xmath142 thus @xmath134 is the function of only @xmath113 in this limit . by numerical analysis of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ besselkk ] ) , we find @xmath143 irrespectively of @xmath113 .",
    "we therefore infer that the integral of eq .",
    "( [ besselkk ] ) gives @xmath0 .",
    "although we have not yet succeeded to show it in general , we can show that , for the case @xmath144 , eq .  ( [ besselkk ] ) yields @xmath145 by using the integral formula for the modified bessel function @xcite , @xmath146 this demonstrates that the exact formula in the limit of @xmath147 agrees with the wkb approximate formula .",
    "then , the decrease of @xmath134 from @xmath0 comes from the term in proportion to @xmath8 , hence the suppression is understood as the quantum effect .",
    "let us summarize the result .",
    "the quantum radiation formula agrees with the wkb formula under the condition @xmath148 we can show that the former condition ( [ wkbapp ] ) is derived from the condition for the wkb approximation , eq.([wkbcondition ] ) , while the latter condition ( [ class ] ) is equivalent to @xmath149 , i.e. , eq.([classicalpic ] ) .",
    "the former condition is satisfied when the compton wavelength of the charged particle is shorter than the hubble horizon length around the bounce regime defined by @xmath150 ( see below ) , where the classical radiation rate becomes maximum .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] plots @xmath134 as a function of @xmath113 with fixed as @xmath151 , 0.1 and 0.01 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] plots @xmath134 as a function of @xmath152 with fixed as @xmath116 and @xmath0 .",
    "these figures show @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and the suppression @xmath156 for the other region .    finally in this section , we mention the physical meaning of these parameters . around the bounce regime @xmath150 , we can write @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the physical momentum , @xmath159 is the compton wavelength , and @xmath160 is the hubble expansion rate , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath113 is the relativistic factor , and @xmath152 can be regarded as the the ratio of the hubble horizon length to the compton wavelength of the charged particle , around the bouncing regime .",
    "here we consider a friedmann spacetime with the scale factor @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a small constant , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this mimics a milne - like bounce universe but with a flat spatial geometry .",
    "the solution of the klein - gordon equation is written with the bessel function , and the positive frequency mode function is @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 from the normalization condition , and we have defined @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the in- and out - vacuum mode functions are therefore given by @xmath169 where the coefficients are @xmath170 and the prime means @xmath171 .",
    "we may write @xmath172 then , we have @xmath173    in the limit @xmath174 , we have @xmath175 thus in the limit , @xmath176 , we may approximate @xmath177 and we have @xmath178 after the integration with respect to @xmath70 , the total energy is @xmath179 this completely agrees with what is obtained from the integration of ( [ feneb ] ) with ( [ continue ] ) . note that this result is obtained under the condition @xmath176 , which may be expressed as @xmath180 where @xmath159 is the compton wavelength and @xmath181 is the hubble expansion rate at the bounce regime @xmath182 , i.e , @xmath183 .",
    "thus the wkb formula is valid as long as the compton wavelength is shorter than the hubble horizon length .",
    "in the present paper , we investigated photon emission from a moving massive charge in an expanding universe .",
    "we considered the scalar qed model for simplicity , and focused on the energy radiated by the process .",
    "first we showed how the larmor formula for the rate of the radiation of energy in the classical electromagnetic theory can be reproduced under the wkb approximation in the framework of the quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "we also investigated the limits of the validity of the wkb formula , by deriving the radiation formula in a bouncing universe in which the mode functions are exactly solvable .",
    "the result using the exact mode function shows the suppression of the radiation energy compared with the wkb formula .",
    "the suppression depends on the ratio of the compton wavelength @xmath184 of the charged particle to hubble length @xmath185 .",
    "namely , the larger the ratio @xmath186 is , the stronger the suppression becomes . in the limit",
    "the compton wavelength is small compared with the hubble length , the radiation formula is found to agree with the wkb formula .",
    "since this limit is equivalent to the limit @xmath187 , the suppression we found is a genuine quantum effect in an expanding ( or contracting ) universe , which is due to the finiteness of the hubble length .",
    "whether the quantum effect on the radiation from a accelerated charge always leads suppression or not is an interesting question .",
    "this would be understood by analyzing higher order terms of the wkb approximation .",
