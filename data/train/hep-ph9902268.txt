    "dilepton measurements in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate  @xcite and high  @xcite bombarding energies have revealed a strong excess of pairs as compared to proton - induced reactions .",
    "it has become clear that the collection of hadronic sources that can successfully account for the measured spectrum in proton - induced reactions fails to reproduce the measured yield in nucleus - nucleus collisions . even after the inclusion of ( free )",
    "@xmath1 annihilation during the interaction phase of the hadronic fireball the enhancement , especially for invariant dilepton masses @xmath2 below the @xmath3-mass , remained unexplained @xcite .",
    "thus many theoretical efforts have concentrated on the role of medium effects in pion and rho meson propagation .",
    "it seems fair to say that there currently exists two main schools of thought that have staked a claim onto the theoretical interpretation of the cern low - mass dilepton measurements .",
    "the first one assigns the rho meson mass as an order parameter of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the cern data , in this approach , then signals a dropping of the rho meson mass  @xcite .",
    "a second interpretation relies on the fact that in a strongly interacting medium , the rho meson will have its width greatly increased due to modifications of its pion cloud  @xcite as well as to the direct coupling to baryonic resonances  @xcite .",
    "whether these two different scenarios can be reconciled , or whether one of them can be eventually ruled out , is the subject of much current research and debates . in this article",
    "we follow the approach that is germane to the second of those theoretical avenues .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a heat bath of pions , kaons and rho mesons , characterized by a finite temperature @xmath4 . using the many - body formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will separately investigate each meson channel and calibrate its individual strength through empirical information on both hadronic and electromagnetic branching ratios , thereby introducing some new channels that have not been considered before in a framework like the one at hand .",
    "the baryon - rich nuclear medium has been shown to strongly affect the vector meson properties , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "then , a self - consistent finite - temperature assessment of the meson contributions is necessary to quantify this assertion .",
    "this is particularly true for cern - sps energies : in spite of the fact that the phase space is dominated by mesons ( with a final pion - to - nucleon ratio of about 5:1 ) , the explanation of the dilepton data in both the dropping mass and the in - medium broadening scenario crucially depends on baryonic contributions . at rhic energies ,",
    "however , it is hard to imagine that baryons could play a major role ; since dilepton measurements in the phenix experiment will be able to address the invariant mass region between @xmath5 and @xmath6 with excellent resolution , in - medium properties of the rho in mesonic matter should be most relevant there .",
    "various analyses in this direction have already been performed  @xcite .",

    "@xcite was mainly attributed to resonant scattering via intermediate @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using finite temperature self - energies which include off - shell effects .",
    "this is to be expected , since the @xmath9 and @xmath8 are located above the free @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds , respectively , which makes the resonant contribution dominant . in order to properly address the low mass region ,",
    "additional mesons have to be considered .",
    "those larger meson ensembles have in fact been included in calculations where individual rates are summed over  @xcite .",
    "there , the contribution of the @xmath12 , for example , appears as a radiative decay channel . in the language used in this work ,",
    "the @xmath12 is a sub - threshold state , _",
    "i.e. _ , in @xmath13 , where , given a typical thermal pion energy of 300 - 400  mev , the relevant @xmath3-mass to form the @xmath12 would be substantially off - shell , @xmath14  mev .    the objective of this article is twofold : on the one hand , we would like to examine if a consistent off - shell treatment of the most important mesonic resonances has a more severe impact on the dilepton production rates than what has been estimated so far within different frameworks .",
    "at the same time , we can investigate possible interference ( or collectivity ) effects in the coherent summation of the various self - energy contributions .",
    "since many - body calculations of this nature can be rather convoluted , we will exhibit an explicit channel decomposition of the considered resonances @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an upper mass limit of 1.3 gev enables us to adequately address the phenomenology that concerns us in this work . as the simplest , but by no means negligible , finite temperature effect in the pion cloud of the rho we will furthermore include the bose - einstein enhancement in the @xmath17 decay width , which is not new  @xcite .",

    "_ e.g. _ , at @xmath52=0.4  gev , both the @xmath12 ( solid line ) and the finite-@xmath4 ( be ) corrections in the pion cloud enhance the free @xmath28 annihilation rate by ( 80 - 90)% each .",
    "much smaller effects are due to the @xmath9 ( 30% enhancement , dashed - dotted line ) as well as the @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( 20% and 15% enhancement , respectively , not shown in fig .  4 ) ,",

    "the major difference arises from the inclusion of the be - enhancement ( and , to a lesser extent , the @xmath204 resonances ) in the present treatment . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gl ] are the results based on the finite temperature part of the calculation by rapp , chanfray and wambach ( = rcw , short - dashed curve )  @xcite , which included @xmath90 , @xmath201 resonances and the bose - einstein enhancement in @xmath181 ( note , however , that the hadronic form factors used in ref .",

    "consequently , in the vicinity of the free @xmath3 mass , where the major broadening effect is due to @xmath90 formation and be - enhancement , the rcw results differ very little from the present ones .",
    "below , @xmath12 formation in @xmath10 scattering is responsible for a substantial increase of the emission rate ( full curve compared to short - dashed curve ) .",
    "another point is finally noteworthy of attention : if one looks at the total spectrum in the vicinity of the @xmath207-peak , one sees that the net signal in our many - body spectral function approach is reduced by about 40% as compared to free @xmath28 annihilation .",

    "this feature will be tested against experiment soon , as a result of improving the mass resolution in the ceres experiment at cern - sps energies , as well as at rhic energies in the phenix detector , where the design value for @xmath208 is at the 1% level .",
    "based on a finite temperature ( matsubara ) formalism we have highlighted different interaction channels that could lead to modifications of the rho properties in a thermal gas of mesons with zero chemical potentials .",
    "using phenomenological interaction vertices compatible with gauge invariance and chiral symmetry , and including hadronic form factors to simulate finite size effects , the free parameters could be tuned to reproduce the empirical hadronic _ and _ radiative decay branchings rather well .",
    "the resulting in - medium @xmath3 self - energy induces a moderate broadening of the @xmath3 spectral function , somewhat higher than what has been found before in refs .",
    "@xcite , but consistent with a recent kinetic theory analysis  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , cancellations in the real part inhibited significant changes of the in - medium @xmath3 pole - mass . corresponding dilepton spectra exhibit a 40% depletion of the @xmath3-peak together with an appreciable enhancement of a factor of @xmath115  3.5 below , largely driven by sub - threshold @xmath209 formation and a bose enhancement in the @xmath210 width .",
    "our results have now to be combined with those obtained with the baryons present , and a time - evolution approach will be coupled with our rates to produce yields that can be compared with experiment .",
    "finally , for the sake of comparison , we have overlayed our results with the those obtained from an ( incoherent ) sum of meson reactions and decays  @xcite .",
    "some differences emerge : the earlier calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite do not include the contribution that can be associated with the radiative decay of the @xmath9 and @xmath100 ; also , the vdm form factor used there was temperature - independent .",
    "the methods employed in this work are tantamount to the generation of a temperature - dependent form factor . besides that",
    ", it seems that the self - consistent many - body treatment does not induce large deviations as compared with the results of ( incoherent ) rate calculations as far as the low - mass enhancement is concerned .",
    "there are , of course , significant differences around the free @xmath3 mass , in that the many - body calculations lead to a reduction of the @xmath3-peak . in fact , these features can be understood in a rather transparent way as follows .",
    "schematically , the @xmath3 spectral function ( which directly governs the dilepton rate ) can be written in terms of the self - energy as @xmath211 where we have absorbed the real part of the self - energy in the ( physical ) @xmath3 mass @xmath161 . in the low - mass region , where @xmath212 and @xmath213 , the denominator is dominated by @xmath161 so that @xmath214 since @xmath215 corresponds to a summation of scattering amplitudes times ( pion- ) density , one immediately recognizes the close resemblance to kinetic theory or low - density expansion approaches .",

    "the nuclear environment has a much stronger impact on the in - medium rho - modifications at comparable densities  @xcite : _",
    "e.g. _ , at a temperature @xmath219  mev , where the thermal pion density , @xmath220  @xmath187 , equals normal nuclear density , the @xmath3 spectral function broadens by about @xmath221mev , which is considerably less than in nuclear matter ( @xmath222  mev , as extracted , _",
    "e.g. _ , from refs .",
    "@xcite ) . from a theoretical point of view this state of affairs may appear puzzling , since towards the chiral restoration transition , which is to be expected around the temperatures considered here , a substantial reshaping of the vector and axial - vector spectral distribution must occur : for @xmath223 , they have to become degenerate as an unavoidable consequence of the ( approximate ) chiral symmetry in the strong interactions .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy may be related to the fact that in the heat bath the @xmath3 modifications as calculated in the present article are still hindered by the goldstone nature of the pions .",
    "this observation does not apply to @xmath3-interactions with nucleons in the finite density case .",
    "a complete understanding still requires further elucidation .",
    "resuming one of the motivations of our analysis , we believe that the understanding of complex strongly interacting systems that live in regions of density and temperature far removed from equilibrium resides not only in confronting theoretical calculations with experimental data , but also in comparing the theories among themselves",
