    "it is studied the production of nuclear fragments with charge changed from that of the incident projectile nucleus by @xmath1 , with @xmath4 .",
    "158 a gev @xmath5 ions ( charge @xmath6 ) from the cern - sps were used as projectiles .",

    "the present analysis refers to a sample of about @xmath12 incident @xmath5 ions on each target .",
    "this work completes the analysis presented in a previous paper [ 1 ] , where we reported on the production of fragments with charge changed by @xmath13 .    in nucleus - nucleus interactions , central and peripheral collisions via strong interaction play an important role .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction can also contribute , as proposed in @xcite . in the present work , the leading outgoing fragment nucleus that keep most of the original longitudinal velocity of the @xmath5 projectile",
    "is studied ; the fragment is inside a scattering angle smaller than 1 mrad .",
    "this exclusive study of the leading fragment is somewhat complementary to the inclusive measurement of all fragments with @xmath14 studied in the interaction of the same beam projectiles on targets similar to ours @xcite .",
    "our @xmath3 nuclear track detector sheets ( chemical composition @xmath15 ) were manufactured by the intercast europe co. of parma , italy , and are similar to those used in a large area experimental search for magnetic monopoles at the gran sasso laboratory ( macro ) @xcite .",
    "the response of the detector was discussed in @xcite .    here",
    "we report and discuss the measurements of the fragmentation cross sections @xmath16 for @xmath17 up to @xmath18 and for various targets with mass @xmath19 .",

    "the detection principle @xcite of the @xmath3 is based on the fact that a throughgoing ionizing particle produces a cylindrical radiation - damaged region along the ion trajectory .",

    "an automatic image analyzer system was used @xcite .",
    "the main components of the system are a microscope with a motorized stage , a video camera and a computer . for each etch - pit cone the base area , the eccentricity , the central brightness and the coordinates of the center were measured .    in this analysis , the six @xmath3 sheets immediately before the target (  a2 \" region in fig . 1 ) and the 14 sheets after the target (  b1 \" region ) were etched and the areas of the pit cones measured ( on the front side of each sheet ) with the automatic system .",
    "a tracking procedure was used to reconstruct the path of the fragments . to identify the projectile and fragment charges we performed an average of the measured etch - pit areas for each track over several sheets .",
    "an example of the distribution of the etched cone areas averaged over at least 12 @xmath3 sheets located after the fragmentation target (  b1 \" region ) is shown in fig .",

    "our data are in agreement with those reported in similar experiments at lower energies , using a 10.6 gev / nucleon @xmath55 beam , when we take into account the increase of the cross sections due to electromagnetic processes .",
    "the measured cross sections were parameterized with a simple power - law relation in terms of the mass of the atomic target , and of the charge of the final fragments .",
    "a three parameters power law , fits relatively well all our data in each of the three regions of @xmath17 .",
    "we find an enhancement of the cross sections with respect to this parameterization , for the production of fragments with @xmath167 in the collisions of the @xmath5 ions with the highest mass targets ( especially in the @xmath5-pb case ) .",
    "this enhancement is probably due to electromagnetically induced nuclear fissions .    for all values of the produced fragment charge ,",
    "the fragmentation cross section depends on the target atomic mass as @xmath168 .",
    "this means that also for these very high kinetic energies , the interaction depends on the target nuclear radius , at least for the leading fragments .    from data on @xmath7 and @xmath8 targets , we derived the fragmentation cross sections on hydrogen .",
    "these cross sections up to @xmath169 follow the same power - law parameterization used for higher mass targets .",
