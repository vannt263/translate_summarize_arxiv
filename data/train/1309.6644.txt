    "the recent discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a spin zero resonance  @xcite , most certainly the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , have already given some clues of what kind of new physics we need to proceed beyond . besides , we know that the sm is not the last answer to the questions brought by the huge endeavor carried over the last three decades of researching in particle physics . some of the new challenges involve neutrino s mass and mixing , the dark matter problem , the matter - antimatter asymmetry , among others .",
    "this motivates us to search for new broader models and theories for attacking these puzzles in the most simple and easiest way .",
    "one such possibility is the enlargement of the gauge group symmetry , implying in new interactions and particle spectrum .",
    "here we focus on one of these gauge extensions of the sm , which can be realized at some tev scale , the @xmath2  @xcite gauge group , which we call 341 for short .",
    "the 341 model is built as a simple extension of the electroweak symmetry gauge group @xmath3 of sm .",
    "it was first suggested in the work of voloshin  @xcite , who considered only the leptonic sector .",
    "further developments of the model including quarks and electroweak currents are presented in ref .",
    "the most attractive feature of this model is the fact that the two chiralities of the lightest leptons are part of a fundamental representation of the gauge group @xmath4 , unifying each lepton family in a single multiplet .",
    "also , the explanation of the family replication comes from anomaly cancellation which , along with qcd asymptotic freedom , requires that only three fermion families might be present in the spectrum , as in the @xmath1 ( 331 ) models  @xcite . besides",
    ", new particles with distinct signature are predicted to appear close to the electroweak scale , like doubly charged vectors and scalars , with some of them carrying two units of lepton number ( the so called bileptons ) , among other features also shared with the 331 models .    in the current literature",
    "there are 341 models with or without exotic electric charges  @xcite . here",
    "we deal with the 341 model with exotic electric charges , where we have reduced the scalar sector to only three scalar quadruplets , which are enough to generate the exact number of goldstone bosons needed to break the 341 symmetry to the @xmath5 . in turn , we have disposed of one scalar quartet and the scalar decuplet from the original version .",
    "these would be responsible for giving mass for the leptons and some of the quarks , but in our scheme they are not mandatory , since we are going to generate those masses by effective operators , as in ref .",
    "our approach poses a considerable reduction in the physical scalar spectrum , which is more suitable for phenomenological studies .",
    "moreover , we compute the running coupling of the abelian gauge group , @xmath6 , and show that there exists a landau pole in this model , similar to the minimal 331 model  @xcite . nevertheless , in this work the 341 model breaks into a 331 model with",
    "right - handed ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , or a 331 model with left - handed heavy neutral fermions ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , and this means that such embedding of the lower symmetry into the 341 model implies a landau pole for these 331 models too .",
    "the advantage of such embedding is that such models are known to possess cold dark matter candidates  @xcite , which are automatically incorporated into the body of this 341 model .",
    "besides , any mechanism that employs non - renormalizable effective operators suppressed by a scale much higher than tev is no longer an option in this scheme , which is the case of neutrino mass generation in some scenarios  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we will show that all fermions , including neutrinos , gain mass from such operators even when the suppression scale is as low as the tev scale  gev was needed to implement his scheme , much higher than what we obtain for our model . ] .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section  [ sec1 ] , we introduce the 341 model with exotic electric charges . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we discuss the perturbative limit of the model , where we compute the value of its landau pole , with the intent of measuring the energy scale at which the model loses its perturbative character . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the fermion mass spectrum is obtained , including the neutrinos .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec5 ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the 341 model is a gauge extension of the electroweak gauge group of sm , that possesses 12 gauge bosons besides the known 8 gluons of strong interactions and the electroweak , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the sm .",
    "since the strong gauge group @xmath12 is kept intact under the symmetry breakdown to @xmath5 , we are going to simply omit it throughout this work . in the following we present the field content of the 341 model and write up its scalar potential and the yukawa lagrangian , which are going to be relevant to our purposes in this work .      in order to assign the fermionic content of the model",
    ", it is useful to recall that the electric charge operator is written as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the electroweak gauge group , @xmath13 .",
    "this allows us to write the electric charge assignment for the fields in the fundamental representation of @xmath14 as , @xmath15 and similarly for the anti - fundamental representation , exchanging the sign of the diagonal generators of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . here ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters to be fixed according to the field distribution in the quadruplets , and @xmath22 is the corresponding @xmath23 charge .",
    "considering the sm content , which we should recover in the symmetry breakdown process , the first two components of the left handed lepton quartet should recover the known doublet structure , meaning that the first component is a neutrino and the second a negatively charged lepton .",
    "moreover , as we are interested in accommodating the associated charge conjugate states for these leptons in the same multiplet , recovering the @xmath7 model in the first symmetry breaking of 341 , the third component of the quartet should be the charge conjugate of the neutrino and the fourth one should be the positive charged partner of the negative lepton , @xmath24 .",
    "this association implies that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which reduces the operator in eq .",
    "( [ cargas1 ] ) to , @xmath28    then , we can arrange all the leptons ( including right - handed neutrinos ) in quartets of @xmath29 symmetry as follows , @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the symbol @xmath35 indicates the respective representation for the multiplet under the 341 symmetry .",
    "for the first generation of quarks , we can assign the left - handed fields to the fundamental representation of the @xmath29 symmetry , while the right - handed ones transform trivially under this symmetry , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the up and down quarks , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the new exotic quarks with electric charges , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the second and third families of left - handed quarks are arranged in the anti - quartet representation of the @xmath29 symmetry , and right - handed quarks in the singlet representation , @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 are exotic quarks with electric charges @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "this arrangement in different representations for the quark families is a consistency requirement such that the model be free of anomalies .",
    "next we explore the scalar content of the model .",
    "originally  @xcite , the 341 model was built with four scalar quartets in order to engender the symmetry breakdown to @xmath5 , give mass to all quarks and avoid mixing among ordinary and exotic quarks .",
    "also , one scalar decuplet was introduced so as to generate charged lepton masses .",
    "one of the purposes of this work is to show that we can diminish the scalar content and still have all desirable properties concerning the symmetry breakdown and the fermion masses ( including neutrinos ) . here",
    "we present the minimal scalar content which will allow us to accomplish this goal , @xmath49 which transform as , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the desired pattern of symmetry breakdown can be obtained if we assume that the following neutral components develop nontrivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the vev @xmath56 is responsible for the first step in breaking the 341 symmetry to 331 , while @xmath57 breaks the 331 symmetry to 321 , the sm , and the final breaking to @xmath5 is provided by @xmath58 . in this way we can impose ,",
    "@xmath59  gev . indeed , as we are going to show later",
    ", @xmath60 and @xmath57 should be no more than few tev or we lose perturbativity , which makes this model interesting in the sense it can be promptly tested at lhc or discarded soon .    the reason we choose the @xmath61 quadruplet to develop vev only in the third component is related to the fact that we do not want mixing among ordinary and exotic quarks on the yukawa lagrangian , which guarantees the usual ckm mixing in the quark sector .",
    "of course this is only possible if we also add a new symmetry to the model , in our case this is going to be a @xmath62 discrete symmetry that we implement later on .    with the scalar and fermionic content defined , we can write down the lagrangian of the model , invariant under the gauge symmetry and the additional discrete symmetry mentioned above . next , we add this symmetry and present the yukawa and scalar lagrangian of the model , also defining our gauge boson spectrum .",
    "let us impose a discrete @xmath62 symmetry that will be suitable to avoid the mixing among ordinary and exotic quarks but also allow for an appropriate scenario for generating fermion masses through effective operators , as we will see later . the @xmath63 charges are @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the identity element of the group .",
    "we then assign @xmath62 charges to the 341 model fields given in table  [ table1 ] .    .@xmath62 symmetry transformation properties for the 341 fields .",
    "those fields not present in this table transform trivially under this discrete group . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : tab1 ] we have also shown the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 when the exotic quarks , @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) , are decoupled , in which case we used the new value for the rge",
    "abelian coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ bi341 ] ) , @xmath73 .",
    "we observe that the highest values for the landau pole scale are reached as the 331 symmetry breaking scale approaches that of 341 model , and can be as high as @xmath74  tev when the exotic quarks are decoupled , although perturbativity is lost about half that scale .",
    "we do not go beyond @xmath75  tev because our results start becoming inconsistent in the sense that @xmath70 gets smaller than @xmath76 , in other words , we lose perturbativity at lower energies than 341 symmetry breaking scale .",
    "this has a deep implication for such class of models , imposing that they must manifest somewhere close to the electroweak scale and may be promptly tested at lhc and/or ilc .",
    "finally , the economical 331 model  @xcite , along with an extra scalar triplet and three singlet scalars , can be embedded in the model here studied .",
    "the same is true for the 331 model when the right - handed neutrino is exchanged by a new neutral fermion , @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "this may have interesting implications for these models as well as for the 341 model developed here .",
    "for the 331 models , it is automatic that they are not valid up to some arbitrary high energy scale , being limited to the landau pole of our 341 model , @xmath78  tev .",
    "such a low cutoff scale is an obstacle for some neutrino mass generation mechanisms in these models  @xcite , a problem we address here with an appropriate discrete symmetry and non renormalizable effective operators . in what concerns the advantages for the 341 model",
    ", we can mention the fact that some of these models possess natural dark matter candidates  @xcite , which can be explored in the context of our 341 model . besides , since the scalar resonance discovered at lhc",
    "@xcite can be perfectly adjusted into the 331 models  @xcite , its phenomenology can be recovered by our model as well , with some room for extra new gauge bosons and scalars to be tested at lhc .",
    "besides , it is possible that the new neutral singlet fields ( under the 331 symmetry ) , may increase the number of dark matter candidates , a question to be investigated elsewhere .    next we show that the fermion mass spectrum can be reproduced by means of non renormalizable effective operators , once the @xmath62 symmetry introduced in the last section can be implemented in the model .",
    "now that we have established the highest energy scale that works as a cutoff for this 341 model , we can make use of the @xmath62 symmetry imposed through the assignments in table  [ table1 ] in order to generate the observed fermion mass spectrum . in the original version of 341 model ,",
    "this spectrum was obtained by means of four scalar quartets plus a decuplet .",
    "the presence of a natural cutoff scale , @xmath74  tev , due to the existence of a landau pole at that scale , turns this scenario suitable for introducing non renormalizable effective operators to get realistic fermion masses and mixing without plaguing the model with too many scalar multiplets .    some of the sm quarks get contributions to their masses from the following dimension-6",
    "effective operators : @xmath79 where again , @xmath80 and @xmath72 label the family number ( or generation ) . considering these operators and the yukawa lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , the up - type quarks mass matrix , in the basis @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 , is written as , @xmath84 while the down - type quarks mass matrix , in the basis ( @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 , is @xmath88 it is remarkable that , by choosing @xmath89 , all entries in these matrices are proportional to the sm symmetry breaking scale , @xmath90  gev , tuned by the dimensionless couplings . in other words , by appropriately tuning these couplings we can recover the sm results concerning quark masses and mixing without much effort .",
    "for example , if we take the above matrices as diagonal ( just for the sake of illustration ) we have : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 e @xmath97 are the masses for the up , charm , top , down , strange and bottom quarks , respectively . for @xmath98  tev and @xmath99  tev , and",
    "considering the known quark masses , @xmath100 we obtain the following values for the respective yukawa couplings , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .    in what concerns the exotic quarks ,",
    "their masses are obtained purely from the yukawa lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , providing the mass for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 it also leads to the exotic quarks mass matrices in the basis @xmath110 @xmath111 , @xmath112 and also in the basis ( @xmath113 @xmath114 , @xmath115 these matrices can be conveniently diagonalized , leaving no massless quarks in the spectrum . instead , just for illustration , we can assume them diagonal and conservatively using , as reference , the lower values obtained by the cms collaboration  @xcite for a sequential fourth family ( @xmath116  gev and @xmath117  gev , which we use for the exotically charged quarks as well ) , imply that all yukawa couplings for the exotic quarks have to be approximately bigger than 0.45 .",
    "as we saw earlier , charged leptons do not receive mass from yukawa lagrangian , but there is an effective dimension-5 operator that does this job , @xmath118 implying the following mass relation for charged leptons , @xmath119 this term provides an sm - like mass term for charged leptons once we assume @xmath120 , with @xmath121 playing the role of a yukawa coupling . considering the set of values for the mass scale parameter we have been using and plugging in the known masses for the leptons , we obtain the following values for the @xmath121 couplings : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , which are comparable to those of sm .    as for the neutrinos ,",
    "the lowest order effective operator that engender their masses is dimension-9 , @xmath125 + + h.c.\\ , ,   \\label{numassop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we are supposing a diagonal basis for simplicity , yielding , @xmath126 with the scales as before , we see that neutrino masses are proportional to @xmath127  gev , which demands tiny values for @xmath128 for a neutrino of @xmath129  ev , not a great improvement if we compare with sm plus right handed neutrinos forming dirac mass terms , but it accounts for sub - ev neutrino masses as well .",
    "this procedure has shown to be effective in producing the desired fermion mass spectrum in the 341 model .",
    "nevertheless , there is an unwanted side effect that has to be circumvented , it concerns the presence of effective operators that would trigger fast proton decay .",
    "the lowest order effective dimension-8 operator that leads to proton decay is , @xmath130 where an anti - symmetric color contraction is implicit .",
    "this operator contains the following term , @xmath131 which yields the decay channel , @xmath132 .",
    "the simplest way to avoid proton decay is to impose a discrete @xmath133 symmetry over the quark fields , such that , @xmath134 that guarantees the proton stability at any order without compromising any of the results we have obtained .",
    "in this work , we have built a 341 gauge model with a lesser scalar content than usual .",
    "the original version contains four scalar quartets and a decuplet , while we reduced this sector to only three scalar quartets . that was possible because we have computed the beta function for its abelian gauge coupling , showing that a landau pole exists at a scale not greater than @xmath135  tev .",
    "this suggests that some underlying structure could emerge before that scale is reached , allowing us to use non renormalizable effective operators to provide the known mass spectrum for the fermions , which otherwise would need the presence of those extra scalars .",
    "it is amazing that such a low scale constrains this class of model at the current energies reachable at colliders such as lhc and/or ilc .",
    "besides , a reduced spectrum makes it most attractive for phenomenological studies , competing with supersymmetry , which has not shown any sign of existence till now .",
    "it has to be remarked that the existence of a cutoff scale as low as few tev , may circumvent the long standing hierarchy problem .",
    "actually , it would appear meaningless to address this problem once the theory enters into a strongly coupled regime at tev scale , where we no longer expect that the sm could be sensitive to .    also , an interesting outcome of our scenario is that a 331 models with neutral fermions , when embedded in this 341 model , have to be faced as possessing this same landau pole , a result that is not obvious in this class of 331 models , where the landau pole is believed to appear much beyond the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "this may have some impact on the phenomenology of such models like the impossibility of implementing neutrino mass under the assumption of existing an arbitrarily high cutoff energy scale for these models . on the other hand ,",
    "knowing the advantages of these models concerning their dm candidates and higgs phenomenology , we can guarantee the same outcome for our model , besides some new extra particles that can be investigated under the light of current experiments at lhc .",

    "<S> we build a gauge model based on the @xmath0 symmetry where the scalar spectrum needed to generate gauge boson and fermion masses has a smaller scalar content than usually assumed in literature . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the running of its abelian gauge coupling and show that a landau pole shows up at the tev scale , a fact that we use to consistently implement those fermion masses that are not generated by yukawa interactions , including neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> this is appropriately achieved by non renormalizable effective operators , suppressed by the landau pole scale . </S>",
    "<S> also , @xmath1 models embedded in this gauge structure are bound to be strongly coupled at this same energy scale , contrary to what is generally believed , and neutrino mass generation is rather explained through the same effective operators used in the larger gauge group . besides , their nice features , as the existence of cold dark matter candidates and the ability to reproduce the observed standard model higgs - like phenomenology , are automatically inherited by our model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results imply that this model is constrained to be observed or discarded soon , since it must be realized at the currently probed energy scale in lhc .    </S>",
