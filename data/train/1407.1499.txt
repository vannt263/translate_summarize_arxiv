    "such a motif could enhance signalling and improve insulation of pathways @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that this enhancement is only effective when coupled with dual phosphorylation , as the scaffold allows for a single upstream kinase to perform both modifications , rather than requiring two separate interactions in the cytosol .",

    "a second assumption is that our model has only one singly phosphorylated state , rather than explicitly considering phosphorylation on either residue .",

    "this argument , however , is misleading in two ways .",

    "frequent rebinding ( due to high @xmath46 ) is itself responsible . to understand the distinction , note that rebinding only causes pseudo - processivity if a kinase is physically capable of catalyzing phosphorylation at both sites , as we have assumed hitherto",
    "instead , we could consider a system with two chemically distinct kinase species ( of equal concentration ) and two chemically distinct phosphatase species ( of equal concentration ) that each can only interact with one of the two residues in question . here",
    ", pseudo - processivity is impossible ; @xmath77 requires the action of two distinct kinases .",
    "the new system is still governed by the differential equations implied by figure [ second - order ] , but primed rate constants ( and underlying reaction probabilities ) now refer to the action of the _ second _ enzyme , and @xmath78 in this necessarily distributive system .",

    "equation ( [ x - low - psiy ] ) still holds , but now @xmath80 , as @xmath81 is a property of the second kinase and @xmath82 is a property of the first .",
    "if the parameters are otherwise identical to the original single - kinase , single - phosphatase system , @xmath83 and @xmath70 are unchanged ( in the low yield limit considered here ) , despite the fact that now @xmath84 .",
    "thus pseudo - processivity itself is not required for the drop in specificity .",
    "why , then , does @xmath70 drop as @xmath85 ?",
    "@xmath81 is the likelihood of a successful reaction given proximal @xmath3 and @xmath1 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "we require @xmath86 ; equation ( [ effective - rates ] ) shows that @xmath87 and @xmath85 as @xmath86 .",
    "we note that @xmath88 is neither sufficient nor necessary ; even with @xmath89 , catalysis is largely distributive if rebinding is rare , and even inefficient catalysis can be pseudo - processive at high @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath86 , there can be many rounds of dissociation and rebinding before modification occurs , favoring inferior substrates that are less likely to be catalyzed the first time .",
    "mathematically ( equation ( [ effective - rates ] ) ) , we see that when @xmath90 , the dependence on the factor which distinguishes @xmath0 and @xmath6 , @xmath91 , is lost . in this low kinase activity limit , therefore , frequent rebinding ( due to high @xmath46 ) reduces specificity and can also coincidentally cause pseudo - processive behaviour if an enzyme can modify both sites .",
    "secondly , the efficacy of proofreading is not @xmath70 , but the increase in @xmath70 due to the second site . equation ( [ x - low - psiy ] ) shows that the contribution from the first site is just as vulnerable to @xmath46-driven increases in @xmath92 as the contribution from the second site is to increases in @xmath81 .",
    "a single - site substrate with the same properties as the first site of the two - site system has specificity @xmath93 in which @xmath94 is the ratio of effective rate constants for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation . in the limit of low kinase activity ,",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 , and the additional specificity due to the second site is @xmath97 .",
    "clearly the contribution of the first site is compromised by @xmath98 in the same way as the contribution of the second site is by @xmath99 .",
    "it too suffers a loss of selectivity due to rebinding ; equations ( [ k_eff eqn ] ) and ( [ effective - rates ] ) show that @xmath100 and @xmath101 have equivalent dependencies on @xmath46 .",
    "thus the contribution of the second site does not systematically fall off faster than the first as rebinding becomes more common ( the site with larger @xmath102 is more sensitive ) .",
    "we note that @xmath103 can remain substantial even when pseudo - processivity is high ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath105 ( the intrinsic selectivity without rebinding is a factor of 10 ) , @xmath103 drops from 1 in the limit @xmath106 to 0.70 at @xmath107 , and only drops to 0.50 when @xmath108 ( at which point the specificity is ` halved ' in the logarithmic sense ; @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110 $ ] are distinguished by a factor of @xmath111 rather than 10 ) . for lower values of @xmath112",
    ", this halving occurs at lower @xmath113 , but for higher values it occurs even later .",
    "robustness of specificity is therefore clearly dependent on the intrinsic specificity at low @xmath46 , but importantly pseudo - processive reactions do not _ necessarily _ preclude proofreading .",
    "we now compare our results to the original work of swain and siggia @xcite .",
    "the main results ( equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) of their paper ) look quite different , because they considered a distinct limit .",
    "they also considered a system with weak kinase activity , but treated the two stages of phosphorylation asymmetrically .",
    "they assumed that the success rate of phosphorylation once the kinase and substrate are bound is low for the first stage ( the reaction is  close to equilibrium \" ) , but potentially not for the second stage .",
    "this assumption was made because the authors reasoned that it would be optimal in allowing the full selectivity from the first stage to be manifested , whilst permitting possible processive behaviour .",
    "thus when swain and siggia allowed processive phosphorylation , they observed that the selectivity arising from the second stage was compromised whereas that arising from the first was not . in our case , however , processivity arises from rebinding events which increase the probability of successful phosphorylation for _ both _ stages , compromising both @xmath50 and @xmath51 and incidentally leading to pseudo - processivity . this symmetry does not arise naturally unless rebinding is explicitly modelled as the cause of pseudo - processivity .",
    "swain and siggia state that proofreading is optimized at low processivity ( @xmath114 small ) . whilst we do not contradict this result",
    ", we find that proofreading is more robust than this statement suggests .",
    "specificity can be relatively high even when the majority of phosphorylations are pseudo - processive ( in the low kinase activity limit , processivity of dephosphorylation reactions is irrelevant ) .",
    "proofreading discriminates between two substrates , @xmath0 and @xmath6 ; even when phosphorylation of @xmath0 is moderately pseudo - processive , @xmath6 can still be less efficiently phosphorylated .",
    "furthermore , the second stage of phosphorylation is not more strongly affected than the first .",
    "this conclusion is the central result of this work . in what follows",
    ", we explore the consequences of finite kinase activity for this result , and then compare to other proposed uses of the dual phosphorylation motif .      for finite kinase activity ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "the second term in equation ( [ x - full ] ) is non - zero .",
    "we first consider the distributive limit of @xmath116 , which is obtained if @xmath117 or by considering a system with two distinct kinases and two distinct phosphatases . in this case , @xmath118 the second term in equation ( [ x - no - processivity ] ) is always negative .",
    "it captures the fact that finite concentrations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 tend to suppress specificity , as the phosphorylation transitions @xmath119 and @xmath120 become saturated for @xmath0 but not for @xmath6 .",

    "if @xmath27 > [ a]$ ] , then increasing @xmath35 can do little to convert more @xmath0 into @xmath1 whereas it will have a larger effect on the @xmath124 transition : large @xmath27 $ ] thus reduces the difference between substrates due to the first phosphorylation stage .",
    "specificity can therefore be compromised by high yields of phosphorylated products .",
    "but the efficacy of _ proofreading _ is perhaps best represented by @xmath125 . as is clear from equation ( [ x - single - site ] )",
    ", high kinase activity in a single - site system also suppresses specificity . to make a fair comparison , we therefore consider the two - site and single - site systems at the same yield of product @xmath126 ( @xmath127/[a_0]$ ] for the single - site system , @xmath128/[a_0]$ ] for the two - site system ) rather than at the same @xmath121/[p]$ ] , as the yield of activated product is after all the output of the system",

    "@xmath156 , the specificity with @xmath157 , can be written in terms of @xmath126 and parameters that depend only on the rate constants : @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath82 and @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath161 the expression reduces to @xmath162 if @xmath116 , so we need only study the consequences of @xmath163 .",
    "firstly , @xmath164 ( with @xmath165 fixed , see supplementary section s5 ) .",
    "thus finite @xmath114 reduces the effect of finite yield @xmath126 ; it is _ always _ better to have a single ( potentially pseudo - processive ) kinase than two distinct kinases ( implying @xmath166 ) with otherwise identical parameters .",
    "this is because converting @xmath0 directly to @xmath2 helps to avoid the buildup of @xmath1 which reduced @xmath162 in the previous section .",
    "note that @xmath164 _ does not _ imply that higher @xmath46 , which will cause increased @xmath82 , is always beneficial provided @xmath167 ; increased rebinding will also tend to reduce @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and will influence @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath170 , the degree of pseudo - processivity in dephosphorylation , is more ambiguous .",
    "when it appears in @xmath171 terms , it too reduces the buildup of @xmath1 .",
    "when it appears separately from @xmath114 , however , it reduces @xmath156 .",
    "the physical explanation , discussed in detail in supplementary section s6 , is subtle . here",
    ", we simply note that pseudo - processivity in the _ dephosphorylation _ pathway , rather than in the phosphorylation pathway or rebinding ( high @xmath46 ) itself , can compromise specificity and proofreading when @xmath172 and @xmath173 are large .",
    "we outline the parameter space for which this sensitivity to processive dephosphorylation is strong in section s6 , where we show that having phosphatases that are intrinsically less efficient than kinases is sufficient ( but not necessary ) to inhibit this sensitivity .",
    "although interesting , we focus on the majority of parameter space where this unwanted behavior is weak .    overall , we find that finite @xmath113 never reduces specificity relative to otherwise equivalent systems with distributive phosphorylation .",
    "processive dephosphorylation can compromise specificity , but outside of a regime of strong sensitivity to @xmath76 , potentially pseudo - processive systems are not worse than distributive systems with equivalent microscopic parameters .",
    "the specificity provided by the second site in either case is generally more sensitive to higher yield @xmath126 than that of the first site , due to the possibility of saturating the @xmath119 transition prior to the @xmath120 transition .",
    "it is also harder to avoid this saturation through low values of @xmath174 when @xmath46 is high .",
    "however , in general the earlier results still hold : the loss of specificity with increased @xmath46 is primarily associated with rebinding itself ( and hence high reaction probabilities ) , rather than pseudo - processivity ; the selectivity of both the first and second sites are compromised by rebinding ; and the additional contribution from the second site can remain significant even when the system is substantially pseudo - processive ( @xmath175 ) , particularly if intrinsic ( @xmath117 ) specificities are high .",
    "we plot characteristic behavior in figures [ calculation-1 ] and [ calculation-3 ] .",
    "conceptually , we consider a system with fixed microscopic enzymatic rate constants , but in which the rate of diffusion with respect to binding can be modulated ( by adding crowders , for example ) . in this picture ,",
    "all catalysis probabilities ( @xmath102 _ etc .",
    "_ ) are constant , and @xmath46 is variable .",
    "we then ask how @xmath70 varies with @xmath46 at fixed @xmath126 ( to provide a fair comparison ) .",
    "we take @xmath176 , @xmath177 to provide representative plots .",
    "other parameter choices are shown in supplementary section s9 .",
    "we consider yields @xmath178 , 0.1 and 0.6 . in figure",
    "[ calculation-1 ] , we plot @xmath156 and @xmath162 as a function of @xmath46 , showing that although specificity drops with @xmath46 and increased @xmath126 , it also does so when each stage requires its own kinase and phosphatase and pseudo - processivity is impossible .    in figure [ calculation-3 ] ,",
    "we plot @xmath179 and @xmath135 parametrically against the ratio of processive to non - processive reactions , @xmath180 .",
    "both contributions to specificity drop with increased @xmath181 ( which itself rises with @xmath46 ) , and increased @xmath126 , but the additional specificity of the second site is somewhat more sensitive to finite @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ calculation-3 ] further demonstrates that contribution of the second site to specificity can remain appreciable at @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) , even at fairly high yields of @xmath2 . for illustrative purposes",
    "we have chosen @xmath184 as @xmath117 .",
    "higher values would make specificity at both stages more robust to increased @xmath185 and yield @xmath126 .",
    "phosphorylation kinetics , as well as the steady - state , could be important . following a sudden activation of upstream kinases , @xmath12/[a_0]$ ] and @xmath122/[b_0]$ ]",
    "always initially rise in a ratio @xmath186 ( see section s7 ) .",
    "thus finite kinase activity does not compromise the difference in phosphorylation rates  only whether this difference is manifested in the steady - state yield .      as outlined in section s8 of the supporting material , the robustness to pseudo - processivity of ultrasensitivity and the use of dual phosphorylation to favor scaffold - mediated pathways",
    "can be treated with the same simple model .",
    "firstly , we can show ( as others have @xcite ) that ultrasensitivity arising from dual phosphorylation is always small when @xmath187 .",
    "ultrasensitivity can be fairly robust when either @xmath188 individually , provided that the second stage of the processive reaction is intrinsically faster than the first .",
    "with regard to the use of dual phosphorylation to favor scaffold - mediated pathways , the ratio of scaffold - derived @xmath2 to that produced without a scaffold is limited to @xmath189 , unless factors independent of dual phosphorylation are relevant .",
    "if the mechanism in the cytosol is purely distributive , the scaffold - derived yield can be arbitrarily larger , but @xmath190 almost completely eliminates the advantage of scaffolds in this context .",
    "unlike proofreading , these alternative uses are generally compromised by pseudo - processivity itself , rather than rebinding ( high @xmath46 ) .",
    "as with proofreading , we can imagine a system with identical parameters , but containing two distinct species of phosphatases and upstream kinases that each can only catalyze one step .",
    "for the alternatives uses , the effects of increasing @xmath46 are substantially alleviated if pseudo - processivity is prohibited in this way ( see section s8 ) .",
    "ultrasensitity ( and scaffold - mediated enhancement ) require kinases and phosphatases to compete against each other at two separate stages when activating / deactivating substrates in the cytosol , whereas proofreading requires two stages at which substrate @xmath0 can be discriminated from @xmath6 .",
    "the first requirement can be met even when @xmath46 is high by having distinct kinases and phosphatases for each stage , whereas this does not help to discriminate @xmath0 from @xmath6 .",
    "we have studied the effect of rebinding - induced pseudo - processivity on proofreading via dual phosphorylation in the linear regime . whilst specificity drops as pseudo - processivity increases ,",
    "this is generally due to a loss of enzymatic selectivity through rebinding , rather than pseudo - processivity itself .",
    "high binding probabilities leading to multiple rebinding events reduce the difference in phosphorylation rates between good and poor substrates , and can incidentally increase pseudo - processivity .",
    "we contrast this with other proposed advantages of dual phosphorylation , namely ultrasensitivity and the ability to enhance scaffold - mediated signalling pathways .",
    "these alternative uses for dual phosphorylation are specifically compromised by pseudo - processivity .",
    "this distinction is not academic  it might be easier for a cell to prevent pseudo - processive behavior ( _ e.g. _ via a finite refractory period of a kinase after phosphorylation @xcite ) than to prevent rebinding after a failed reaction .",
    "we find that eliminating pseudo - processive phosphorylation in this way would always be beneficial for ultrasensitivity and the ability to enhance scaffold - mediated signalling , but never for proofreading ( sections s5 and s8 ) .",
    "however , pseudo - processivity itself in the _ dephosphorylation _ pathway can compromise specificity under certain conditions . although rebinding might be difficult to control through evolution , the reduction in both ultrasensitivity and specificity with @xmath46 could be tested in vitro by varying the concentration of an inert crowding agent @xcite .",
    "the distinction between @xmath46 and pseudo - processivity would also be testable with kinases modified to reduce nucleotide release rates .",
    "the efficacy of proofreading is primarily related to the additional benefit in specificity obtained by adding a second site .",
    "we find that even when reactions become significantly pseudo - processive due to rebinding , the addition of the second site can still provide a substantial relative boost to specificity , meaning that proofreading is still useful .",
    "in fact , as pseudo - processivity can only occur in parallel with a reduced intrinsic selectivity for a single site , proofreading via multi - site phosphorylation is even more important in maintaing specificity .",
    "proofreading is based on the _ difference _ between two pathways , and a poor substrate can still be less efficiently phosphorylated even if some discrimination is lost through rebinding ( and finite product yields ) . the degree to which this is true depends , of course , on the intrinsic discrimination without rebinding .",
    "the other uses of dual phosphorylation considered here , however , depend on the properties of a single pathway and are fundamentally limited by moderate pseudo - processivity in that pathway",
    ". we would therefore argue that if a signalling cascade is observed to be significantly pseudo - processive in experiment , its dual phosphorylation motif is most likely used for proofreading .",
    "we have considered an extremely simple model without spatial resolution . to test this simplification ,",
    "we simulate a lattice model in section s3 , reproducing basic results .",
    "we also demonstrate that our approach is consistent with limits of a reaction - diffusion description ( section s2 ) .",
    "we have also neglected long - lived enzyme / substrate complexes due to the increased number of relevant parameters and non - linearities in equations .",
    "analytic results in the unsaturated linear regime are valuable for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the biophysical principles underlying our conclusions are still relevant in the non - linear regime ; our basic findings are thus likely to be widely applicable .",
    "indeed , we have considered finite complex concentrations for a few systems in section s12 of the supplementary material ; moderate concentrations of enzyme / substrate complexes have only a weak effect , and we do not see evidence that reactant saturation invalidates our previous findings on proofreading . secondly , detailed analysis of the linear regime is an important first step in comprehending the full non - linear system , and the analytic results presented here will help to frame the the findings of future work into rebinding and pseudo - processivity in the general case . finally , although some authors have argued for substantial saturation in kinase cascades @xcite , recent work has suggested that mapk cascades can function in regimes in which the reactants are not strongly saturated @xcite .",
    "our analysis in the linear regime is therefore not only instructive , but of direct biological relevance .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of pseudo - processivity in non - linear systems remains an important open question . to explore the accuracy of our modeling of a crowded environment , explicit simulations ( analogous to recent work on transcription factors @xcite )",
    "would also be beneficial .",

    ".    in our simple model , no matter how efficient the reactions once the enzymes are in close proximity , overall rate constants are limited by diffusion to @xmath37 , and thus it plays the same role as @xmath210 in the description of gopich and szabo.@xcite in the limit of infinitely fast diffusion , rate constants in our model would be given by a rate of reaction given close proximity ( @xmath215 , @xmath216 ) , multiplied by @xmath39 ( which essentially gives the probability that the reactants are in close proximity ) .",

    "this is because in the reaction - diffusion picture",
    ", reactions occur at a two - dimensional surface , rather than from some close - proximity state of finite volume as is implicitly assumed in models such as the one used here . equation ( [ mapping ] ) shows how the two descriptions are related .    substituting into equation ( [ gopich ] ) , rearranging , and using the quantities defined in the main text",

    "there is always a competition between @xmath288 and @xmath304 to determine whether the majority of molecules that reach the @xmath27 $ ] state are converted into @xmath26 $ ] or @xmath12 $ ] ; this competition is no less important just because the lifetime of @xmath27 $ ] is short .",
    "we emphasize that in this section we are not attempting to map directly between specific realizations of the pseudo - processive case in figure [ cyclic illustration](a ) and the distributive case in figure [ cyclic illustration](b ) . this would be inappropriate unless @xmath285 are carefully adjusted , as @xmath285 depend on kinase and phosphatase concentrations , which must be set to obtain the same yield of @xmath2 in both cases .",
    "instead , we are simply demonstrating that in a generic cyclic system with processive dephosphorylation such as figure [ cyclic illustration](a ) , @xmath12/[a_0]$ ] can lose sensitivity to @xmath288 at lower ratios of @xmath12/[a]$ ] than in a generic distributive system such as figure [ cyclic illustration](b ) .",
    "pseudo - processive dephosphorylation can therefore make it easier to lose sensitivity of @xmath12/[a_0]$ ] to the rates of phosphorylation ( particularly the second stage ) , and thereby lose the ability to provide specificity for @xmath0 over @xmath6 . of course",
    ", our partially pseudo - processive systems are not as idealized as figure [ cyclic illustration](a ) , but the principle remains valid , and the contribution to specificity of the second site can be lost if substrates typically follow a loop @xmath280 in which the @xmath305 transition is fast .",
    "this explains why specificity can be reduced if we convert a system with a distinct phosphatase for each stage of dephosphorylation into one with only a single phosphatase without changing any other parameters of the system , including the rebinding - influenced selectivity factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "one might ask whether pseudo - processive phosphorylation can have a similar effect , but it can not . by symmetry , pseudo - processive phosphorylation can reduce specificity in the dephosphorylation pathway in an analogous fashion , but that is not our concern here .",
    "we show in section [ derivative proof ] that if we convert a system with a distinct kinase for each stage of phosphorylation into one with only a single kinase without changing anything else , the specificity can _ only _ improve . in the language of this section , if a system undergoes the cycle @xmath306 , we find that @xmath2 only loses sensitivity to phosphorylation rates when @xmath12 \\gg [ a]$ ] or @xmath299 \\gg [ a]$ ] .    having established the underlying physical mechanism , we return to equation ( 14 ) of the main text to outline when the effect is substantial .",
    "the relevant term is large when @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "additionally , if @xmath309 , @xmath113 must be small ( or the @xmath310 term in equation ( 14 ) of the main text can provide a counteracting effect ) .",
    "these requirements are easiest to fulfill at high yield @xmath126 ( when @xmath311 is generally large ) , and when @xmath312 , as @xmath313 @xmath314 ( or more generally , intrinsically inefficient phosphatases compared to kinases ) prevents this loss of specificity due to pseudo - processive dephosphorylation . if @xmath314 , then we can consider two regimes .    1 .   at low @xmath46 ,",
    "the difference in intrinsic efficiencies is manifest in reaction rates and @xmath315 .",
    "thus @xmath316 and the relevant effect is not large .",
    "2 .   as @xmath86 , @xmath317 , which would suggest that the effect in question becomes more substantial .",

    "when @xmath307 and @xmath308 , proofreading can be extremely sensitive to pseudo - processivity in the dephosphorylation pathway .",
    "an extreme example is given in figure [ proofreading_non_robust](a )  at low but non - zero values of @xmath46 , @xmath70 drops rapidly . as can be seen from figure [ proofreading_non_robust](b ) ,",
    "this drop is due to the additional benefit of the second phosphorylation site being rapidly lost .",
    "furthermore , the drop is explicitly due to processivity  the results for an identical system but with separate enzymes for each stage of phosphorylation / dephosphorylation are also plotted in figure [ proofreading_non_robust](a ) , showing a drop in specificity only at high @xmath46 .",
    "the results for a system in which only the phosphorylation process requires separate enzymes ( also shown in figure [ proofreading_non_robust](a ) ) match the original case , clearly indicating that it is processivity itself in the dephosphorylation pathway that is to blame .",

    "we explore the robustness of this amplification mechanism to a partially pseudo - processive phosphorylation pathway in the cytosol . to do that , we first need to decide how the scaffold should be modelled .",

    "* we assume _ all _ upstream kinases are bound to a scaffold , and that there are no spare scaffolds to interfere with the process .",
    "* we assume that once a downstream kinase binds to the scaffold , it quickly reaches a doubly phosphorylated state and then detaches immediately .",
    "* we assume that binding of the downstream kinase ( regardless of phosphorylation state ) to the scaffold has the same rate constant as the relevant phosphorylation step ( @xmath13 , @xmath341 ) in the cytosol .",
    "* we assume that dephosphorylation is cytosolic and unaffected by the scaffold .",
    "the first assumption negates issues such as the `` prozone effect'',@xcite which tend to make scaffolds less effective .",
    "the second assumption implies that the scaffolds are maximally efficient in causing double phosphorylation .",
    "the second and third assumptions , however , do preclude two mechanisms by which scaffolds can enhance the activation level of a substrate .    *",
    "if a scaffold binds to the kinases faster than the intrinsic rate of reaction between the kinases in the cytosol ( @xmath13 and @xmath341 ) , it can potentially accelerate phosphorylation in an enzyme - like manner , allowing kinases to come together and react faster than they would in the absence of the scaffold . *",
    "if the release of the phosphorylated downstream kinase from the scaffold is slow , the total level of activated downstream kinases can be enhanced because the scaffold can either shield the downstream kinase from phosphatases , or provide a platform for ` recharging ' it if it is dephosphorylated on the scaffold .",
    "either mechanism can lead to an enhanced degree of activation for downstream kinases , although the additional activated kinases are attached to the scaffold .",
    "these alternative enhancement mechanisms , however , are independent of the idea that scaffolds can enhance signalling by making otherwise distributive phosphorylation mechanisms effectively processive .",
    "in fact , they do not even require the dual phosphorylation motif .",
    "we therefore limit the system in this way to restrict our investigation to the question at hand . given that these effects are precluded , this simplified scaffold model is in some sense maximally efficient ; a downstream kinase only has to bind to a scaffold to be instantly doubly phosphorylated , and it can do this as fast as the substrate naturally undergoes single phosphorylation in the cytosol .",
    "we shall consider the steady - state signal when only phosphorylation via the scaffold pathway can occur , and compare that to the cytosolic - only case ( the same procedure that was followed by kocieniewski _",
    "@xcite ) . in the absence of scaffolds",
    ", we consider the same system as illustrated in figure 3 of the main text , and so the steady - state is identical to equation ( 5 ) of the main text ( although we use @xmath342 instead of @xmath14 to emphasise that this is pseudo - processive phosphorylation in the cytosol ) . for scaffold - only phosphorylation",

    "we could imagine , as in the main text , that we have two distinct upstream kinases ( both bound to the scaffold when appropriate ) and two distinct phosphatases . in this system ,",
    "@xmath356 but the reaction on the scaffold is still effectively processive .",
    "the result is that the limit placed on @xmath357}/{[a_{pp}^{\\rm cyt}]}$ ] by @xmath355 at low @xmath35 vanishes , regardless of whether rebinding events occur frequently or not .",
    "the ratio @xmath358 can either increase or decrease with rebinding probability , depending on whether cytosolic phosphorylation or dephosphorylation is intrinsically more efficient .",
    "these changes reflect increases or decreases in the overall cytosolic yield with increased rebinding .",
    "these variations are not a fundamentally limiting factor in the same sense as @xmath359 , and @xmath357}/{[a_{pp}^{\\rm cyt}]}$ ] can be pushed arbitrarily high by reducing @xmath35 for any value of @xmath360 .",
    "huang and ferrel @xcite originally pointed out that double phosphorylation , when the mechanism is distributive , can lead to a sharper transition from low to high yield of activated substrate ( as @xmath31/[p]$ ] is varied ) than kinases that need only a single activation .",
    "such an effect has been dubbed ` ultrasensitivity ' . for completeness",
    ", we now consider the robustness of the ultrasensitive response to partial pseudo - processivity in the language of the model presented in this paper .",
    "we note that other authors have reached similar conclusions elsewhere.@xcite in assuming that all enzymes are unsaturated , we have no contribution to ultrasensitivity from various mechanisms involving sequestration of products or enzymes , simplifying the analysis greatly , and allowing focus on the usefulness of the dual phosphorylation motif itself .    a common , though not necessarily ideal , measure for the sharpness of the transition is to fit the curve to a hill function , and label transitions as ultrasensitive if the coefficient found is greater than unity .",
    "the fits can be quite poor , however , meaning that the result may not accurately describe the transition . here",

    "the use of 10% and 90% is of course somewhat arbitrary , but none of the results presented here are particularly sensitive to this choice .    to be precise ,",
    "let us consider @xmath361 , where @xmath362 is the value of @xmath35 required to give a yield of @xmath12/[a_0]=g$ ] .",

    "it is easy to see , however , that @xmath364 is irrelevant : the ratio of rate constants for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation sets the value of @xmath35 at the transition midpoint , but does not affect its width .",
    "it is helpful to note that , in the fully processive limit , @xmath365 , the measure reduces to @xmath366 in the case of @xmath367 and @xmath368 , @xmath369 , the well - known value for a hyperbolic response .",
    "such a value would also be obtained for an unsaturated system involving a single phosphorylation site . in the distributive case ,",
    "we obtain @xmath370 the second term is always less than or equal to zero for @xmath371 , meaning that the metric @xmath372 can be reduced below the processive ( or single phosphorylation site ) value , corresponding to a sharper transition .",

    "physically , non - zero @xmath14 and @xmath15 allow the system to circumvent the essential intermediate @xmath1 state .",
    "when analyzing proofreading , we considered its efficacy for a given set of catalytic probabilities as the diffusive properties were varied ( through @xmath46 ) , to reflect the consequences of slower diffusion with fixed underlying chemistry .",

    "it is possible to choose catalytic probabilities such that @xmath384 initially falls with @xmath46 , before eventually rising to the non - ultrasensitive limit . to do this",

    "it is interesting to note that lower values of @xmath32 allow ultrasensitivity to be moderately robust to increases in @xmath185 ( pseudo - processivity in the phosphorylation pathway ) provided @xmath392 ( pseudo - processivity in the dephosphorylation pathway ) is small .",
    "this phenomenon can be seen clearly in figure [ ultra - curves](c ) , in which the system retains the majority of its ultrasensitivity at the point @xmath393 . to explain this observation , consider figure [ ultra - robust ] , which represents a system with @xmath394 and @xmath395 .",
    "although there is no intermediate state during phosphorylation , there is one present in dephosphorylation , and thus there are still two stages in which phosphorylation can compete with dephosphorylation , permitting ultrasensitivity . as we have pointed out previously , establishing ultrasensitivity",
    "involves keeping the concentration of the intermediate low .",
    "if @xmath32 is low , the intermediate will necessarily be drained quickly relative to the processive phosphorylation of @xmath0 to @xmath2 , and hence the concentration of @xmath1 remains low regardless of @xmath35 , permitting a sharp transition .",
    "if @xmath32 is not low , one of two things can happen :    * if @xmath33 is low , then at a concentration ratio @xmath35 near the transition from @xmath0- to @xmath2-dominated systems , the intermediate state during dephosphorylation has almost no effect , because it is overwhelmingly converted into @xmath0 rather than @xmath2 .",
    "hence it is not effective in establishing ultrasensitivity , just like in fully a processive system in which intermediates are effectively always committed to end in @xmath2 or @xmath0 . *",
    "if @xmath33 is high , then the intermediate state @xmath1 drains slowly , becoming very prevalent at the transition from @xmath0- to @xmath2-dominated systems and precluding ultrasensitivity .",
    "these two cases , along with the low @xmath32 example , are illustrated schematically in figure [ ultra - robust ] .",
    "mathematically , one can see that if @xmath396 in equation ( [ ultrasensitivity ] ) , the first term inside the square root is proportional to @xmath397 , and thus can be small compared to the second term if @xmath32 is small .",
    "such a result is advantageous as the second term in the square root is the one responsible for reducing @xmath398 below @xmath399 , as it is larger in the denominator than the numerator .",
    "although this result is intriguing , we note that one would require a very low intrinsic value of @xmath32 ( that obtained in the limit @xmath117 ) to maintain ultrasensitivity at large @xmath185 , especially as the higher values of @xmath46 that cause @xmath185 to grow also cause @xmath400    low values of @xmath33 have an equivalent effect for @xmath401 provided @xmath402 is small .",
    "it is not possible , however , to preserve ultrasensitivity through lower values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 when both @xmath392 and @xmath403 .",
    "mathematically , when both @xmath185 and @xmath392 are large , the first term inside the square root in equation ( [ ultrasensitivity ] ) contains terms proportional to @xmath373 , and the argument given for moderate @xmath185 , low @xmath32 is invalid .",

    "the minimal value of @xmath384 is 1.72 and the transition from @xmath408 to @xmath409 is only 1.5 times more rapid than in a single - site system .",
    "these mathematical limits are quite distinct from the consequences of finite pseudo - processivity for proofreading ; the efficacy of discrimination between substrates and proofreading is only capped by the biophysical limitations of the intrinsic selectivity parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , rather than mathematical constraints .",
    "it is important to note that the loss of ultrasensitivity is predominantly associated with pseudo - processivity , rather than the basic rebinding kinetics as it was with proofreading .",
    "although there is some variation in @xmath384 with @xmath46 for the system with distinct enzymes ( because high rebinding probabilities can influence @xmath33 and @xmath32 by making less favourable reactions more likely to be successful ) , at least for the illustrated systems it is a small effect compared to the change with finite @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we show data for additional choices of system parameters , to demonstrate that the results in the main text are not atypical .",
    "results for two additional sets of parameters are given in figure [ other_proof ] .",
    "we plot @xmath70 against @xmath46 , with the results when distinct kinases and phosphatases are required for each step also shown for comparison .",
    "we also compare the specificity gained from the first and second phosphorylation stages , @xmath135 and @xmath411 , and plotting both against @xmath185 .",
    "although the results are numerically distinct , they do not contradict our claims from the main text ; namely that although specificity decreases with increased processivity , this is usually a result of a reduction in intrinsic specificity due to rebinding , that specificity can be robust to moderate processivity in the @xmath0 phosphorylation pathway , and that the contribution of the second site to specificity can also remain substantial .",
    "higher intrinsic specificities would give increased tolerance to finite rebinding probabilities and yields .",
    "in the main text , we considered enzymatic reactions that were only differentiated by the rate at which reactants unbound from each other .",
    "alternative limits might be that reactants are distinguished by their intrinsic catalytic constants , or their intrinsic binding rates . in this section",
    "we show that our arguments also hold in these cases .",
    "firstly , if reactions are distinguished by @xmath412 , the arguments of the main text follow exactly as before .",
    "this is because in this unsaturated model the effect of modulating @xmath413 is only felt via @xmath223 , and the same is true for @xmath412 .",
    "given a set of probabilities @xmath223 , @xmath91 , @xmath414 and @xmath415 , our results are equally valid whether differences in these quantities are due to intrinsic catalytic rates , intrinsic unbinding rates , or a combination of the two .",
    "we note that when the system is not in the second - order regime and enzymes / substrates are saturated , we would expect distinct behaviour in some cases .",
    "if the enzymatic interactions are differentiated by @xmath221 , the situation is a little different .",
    "now @xmath416 , but @xmath46 , @xmath417 , @xmath418 and @xmath419 are all distinct ( and different for @xmath0 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the overall specificity @xmath70 is still given by @xmath420 but now the selectivity factors and rate constant ratios are @xmath421 @xmath50 and @xmath51 should be compared with equation ( 7 ) of the main text ",
    "note in particular that the first factor now depends on @xmath46 values rather than @xmath223 values .    unlike our previous analyses",
    ", there is no single @xmath46 for all reactions that can be varied while all other parameters are kept fixed to model increased crowding , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 can not be expressed as succinctly in terms of @xmath422 and @xmath423 as in equation ( 8) of the main text .",

    "if this is done , it can be seen that @xmath50 and @xmath51 respond to lower @xmath42 ( and hence increased rebinding probabilities ) in a similar way to the original system , falling from @xmath432 in the limit of large @xmath42 to unity as @xmath433 .",

    "the specificity in a single - site system is more strongly compromised by the finite lifetimes of complexes than the additional specificity of the second site .",
    "it is also worth noting that larger intrinsic selectivities @xmath50 and @xmath51 would mean that some specificity due to both the first and second sites can be maintained at higher levels of saturation than in this case , just as larger intrinsic selectivities @xmath50 and @xmath51 allow specificity at higher yields @xmath126 in the unsaturated case . thus our conclusions relating to the efficacy of proofreading are not necessarily compromised by non - negligible concentrations of enzyme / substrate complexes  we defer a full investigation of these effects to later work ."
