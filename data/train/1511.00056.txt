    "after the epoch of recombination , the growth of an overdense region in the primordial matter density field would be driven by the competition between its self - gravity and the cosmic expansion .",
    "the simplest approach to understanding the gravitational evolution of an initially overdense region is to regard it as a bound mini - universe with positive curvature and then to solve the friedmann equations under the assumption that the region has a uniform density and a spherically symmetric shape @xcite .",
    "the friedmann equations have a well known solution for this case , according to which the radius of the spherical region varies with time as a cycloid .",
    "the maximum radius that the spherical overdense region with uniform density will reach during its cycloidal change is called the `` turn - around radius , '' after which it begins to shrink back since the effect of its self - gravity becomes stronger than that of the cosmic expansion . in the subsequent nonlinear evolution",
    ", the region will go through relaxation , virialization and the eventual formation of a bound object @xcite .",
    "the virial radius of a bound object formed at the site of an initial overdense region develops only weak dependence on the background cosmology since it is determined mainly by the total mass contained in the region @xcite .",
    "whereas , the turn - around radius of an initial overdense region depends sensitively on the background cosmology as well as on the total mass , since at the turn - around moment the pulling effect of its self gravity is cancelled out by the pushing effect of dark energy on the region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a background universe that has a larger amount of dark energy with a more negative equation of state , the turn - around radii of overdense regions would become smaller since their self - gravity becomes comparable earlier to the anti - gravity of dark energy @xcite .",
    "hence , if the turn - around radii of the initial overdense regions corresponding to the galaxy groups and clusters could be estimated with high accuracy , they must provide a powerful independent diagnostics for the density and equation of state of dark energy @xcite .    by using an analytic argument",
    ", @xcite recently put a stringent upper bound , @xmath1 , on the turn - around radius that a bound object with mass @xmath2 can have in a flat @xmath0cdm ( cosmological constant @xmath0 and cold dark matter ) universe : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a proportionality factor whose value depends on the geometrical shape of an initial overdense region from which the bound object originates .",
    "only , provided that the shape of an overdense region possesses a perfect spherical symmetry , the factor @xmath4 equals unity , being independent of @xmath2 . for the realistic case of a non - spherical region",
    "whose gravitational growth tends to proceed quite anisotropically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath4 slightly exceeds unity ( roughly @xmath5 ) taking on the mass dependence ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from here on ,",
    "the _ spherical bound _",
    "( _ non - spherical bound _ ) refers to @xmath1 with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in equation ( [ eqn : rt_max ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the `` zero - velocity surface '' around a bound object should be a good approximation of the true turn - around radius of the initial overdense site at which the object formed . here",
    "the zero - velocity surface around a bound object is defined as the radial distance from the object center at which the peculiar motions generated by the object s gravity become equal in magnitude to the hubble expansion .",
    "@xcite claimed that a violation of the spherical ( non - spherical ) bound given in equation ( [ eqn : rt_max ] ) by any bound object observed in the universe would contest the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology as a smoldering ( smoking ) gun counter - evidence , urging exploration of such bound - violating objects on the galaxy group and cluster scales .",
    "unfortunately , however , the observational estimate of the turn - around radius of a galaxy group / cluster requires us to fulfill a tough mission : accurately measuring the peculiar velocities of the neighbor galaxies located in the bound - zone of the galaxy group / cluster ( see section [ sec : prediction ] for the definition of a bound - zone ) .    here",
    ", we develop a novel methodology to estimate the turn - around radius of a galaxy group / cluster without directly measuring the peculiar velocities .",
    "it utilizes the universal formula for the radial velocity profile empirically derived by @xcite to estimate the turn - around distances where the total radial velocities of the bound - zone galaxies vanish .",
    "we apply this new methodology to the ngc 5353/4 group , a galaxy group with mass @xmath8 , at a distance of @xmath9 mpc from us , appeared to be surrounded by the low - density environment @xcite . throughout this paper , to be consistent with @xcite , we assume the standard planck model with @xmath10",
    "@xcite whenever the background cosmology has to be specified .",
    "the regions outside of the virial radius , @xmath11 , of an isolated massive object in the expanding universe can be divided into three distinct zones .",
    "the nearest to the object is the infall zone where the object s gravity defeats the cosmic expansion .",
    "if a lower - mass object is located in this zone , it is expected to undergo infall into the potential well of the massive object to eventually become its satellite @xcite .",
    "the farthest from the object is the hubble zone where the cosmic expansion wins over the object s gravity .",
    "if a smaller object is located in this zone , then its effective motion would be just the hubble expansion since the gravitational influence from the massive object should be negligible .",
    "the in - between is the bound zone where the object s gravity is not dominant but strong enough to slow down the hubble flow .",
    "the three zones ( the infall , the bound , and the hubble zones ) correspond roughly to the following ranges of the separation distances , @xmath12 , from the object center : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite has discovered the existence of the following universal profile of the bound - zone peculiar velocities : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the peculiar velocity of a test particle at a separation distance of @xmath12 from a massive object with virial mass @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the unit vector in the radial direction from the center of the object to the position of a test particle , @xmath11 is the virial radius of the object related to its virial mass as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is @xmath22 times the critical density @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the central velocity of a test particle at @xmath11 given as @xmath25 .",
    "the negative sign in the right - hand side ( rhs ) of equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) reflects that the object s gravity is in the direction of @xmath26 .",
    "the universality of the above profile is manifested by the independence of the power - law index @xmath27 from the masses and redshifts of the objects . analyzing the numerical data around the cluster halos identified from high - resolution @xmath28-body simulations for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology ,",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) with a constant power - law index of @xmath29 approximates the peculiar velocity profile of dark matter particles in the bound zones well , no matter what masses and redshifts the cluster halos have .",
    "their numerical result implied that the expectation value of the peculiar velocity at any point of the bound zone around a cluster could be theoretically evaluated .",
    "it has also been found by @xcite that the matter - to - halo bias does not alter the functional form of equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) by demonstrating that it validly approximates not only the peculiar velocity profile of dark matter particles , but also that of the galactic halos located in the bound zone .",
    "this numerical finding has elevated the practicality of equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) since what is directly observable is not the positions of dark matter particles but those of the bound - zone galaxies . here",
    ", we claim that the very existence of the universal peculiar velocity profile in the bound zone of a massive object ( like a galaxy group and cluster ) should enable us to estimate its turn - around radius without directly measuring the peculiar velocity field in the bound - zone .",
    "note that the bound - zone of a galaxy cluster is similar to the linear regime when the initial proto - cluster evolved until the turn - around moment .",
    "accordingly , the peculiar velocities of the bound - zone galaxies predicted by equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) can be treated as the linear perturbations to the zero mean and thus must be a good approximation to the peculiar velocity of the initial proto - cluster region .",
    "now , extrapolating equation ( [ eqn : vp ] ) to the turn - around moment , we determine the value of @xmath30 as the separation distance at which the following equality holds true . @xmath31",
    "the left - hand side ( lhs ) of equation ( [ eqn : rt ] ) represents nothing but the hubble expansion while the rhs is the peculiar velocity of an initial proto - cluster region in the radial direction at the turn - around radius @xmath30 approximated by the predictable peculiar velocity of a bound - zone galaxy in the radial direction at the same distance @xmath30 .    to solve equation ( [ eqn : rt ] ) in practice ,",
    "we consider the total radial velocity profile , @xmath32 , defined as the combination of the hubble expansion with the peculiar velocity in the radial direction : @xmath33 and then look for the range of @xmath12 where the function , @xmath32 , crosses the zero line . it should be emphasized that finding a solution to @xmath34 with equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) requires information only on the radial positions of the bound - zone galaxies but not on their peculiar velocities .",
    "we plot equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) for the case of @xmath35 ( the virial mass of ngc 5353/4 , see @xcite ) as the gray region in figure [ fig : vr ] .",
    "given the numerical result of @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtained by @xcite , we let the power - law index @xmath27 and the multiplicative constant @xmath38 vary in the ranges of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , to plot equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) . the section of the dotted line ( @xmath41 ) inside the gray region represents the expected range of the turn - around radius of a galaxy group with @xmath35 for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology . the blue and green solid lines indicate the locations of the spherical and non - spherical bounds , respectively .",
    "the comparison of the estimated range of @xmath30 with the spherical and non - spherical bounds in figure [ fig : vr ] leads us to answer the question of whether it is possible to find a bound - violating galaxy group with mass @xmath35 in a flat @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "as can be seen , the crossing between the blue ( green ) solid and the black dotted lines occurs inside ( outside ) the gray region .",
    "this result indicates that although it is not impossible for such a galaxy group to violate the spherical bound in a flat @xmath0cdm model , the violation of the non - spherical bound would rarely occur on that mass scale .    to see whether this critical prediction depends on the mass scale , we vary the values of @xmath18 in equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) and find the turn - around radius @xmath30 as a function of @xmath18 , which is shown in figure [ fig : rt_m ] as gray region .",
    "the blue and green solid lines correspond to the spherical and non - spherical bounds as a function of @xmath18 , respectively . as can be seen",
    ", the blue ( green ) solid line is inside ( outside ) the gray region at all mass scales .",
    "thus , the @xmath0cdm prediction against the bound - violation is extended to all mass scales : it is quite unlikely to find a bound object whose turn - around radius exceeds the non - spherical bound in the standard flat @xmath0cdm cosmology , no matter what mass scale the object has .",
    "@xcite suggested that the optimal target for the investigation of the bound violation should be a `` nearby galaxy group located in the low - density environment . ''",
    "the proximity condition is necessary to minimize the observational uncertainties .",
    "a low - density environment around a target is required to minimize the difference between the virial and the turn - around masses .",
    "note that @xmath2 in equation ( [ eqn : rt_max ] ) represents the turn - around mass enclosed by the turn - around radius @xmath30 which is expected to be larger than the virial mass @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the turn - around mass is often approximated by the virial mass since the former is unmeasurable while a variety of methods has been developed to measure the latter .",
    "this approximation , however , works well for the case that a given target is located in the low - density environment .",
    "the reason for the preference of the groups to the clusters lies in the hierarchical nature of structure formation process : the galaxy groups are more relaxed systems than the galaxy clusters since the former must have formed earlier than the latter .",
    "thus , the systematic errors produced by the deviation of the true dynamical state from complete relaxation would contaminate the measurements of the virial masses of the galaxy groups less severely than those of the galaxy clusters .    here , we require one more condition in addition to the above three for an optimal target : the presence of a thin straight filament in the bound - zone . according to @xcite , the total radial velocities and three - dimensional positions of the galaxies could be readily inferred from the observable line - of - sight velocities and the two - dimensional projected positions , if the bound - zone galaxies are located along one - dimensional filament .",
    "if the galaxies are distributed along one - dimensional filaments , they exhibit coherent motions along the filaments , which in turn makes it easier to judge whether or not the observed galaxies are located in the bound - zone of a target ( see also s. kim et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) . in our previous work @xcite , which reconstructed the radial velocity profile of the virgo cluster and compared it to equation ( [ eqn : vr ] )",
    ", it was confirmed that the presence of a thin straight filament is a key ingredient for the accurate reconstruction of the radial velocity profile of the bound - zone galaxies .",
    "we find that the ngc 5353/4 group meets all of the above four conditions .",
    "it is only @xmath9 mpc away from us and observed to be located in the low - density environment @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional position of the center of the ngc 5353/4 group ( say , @xmath42 ) is measured by using available information on its equatorial coordinates and comoving distance . to estimate the virial mass , @xmath18 , of ngc 5353/4 , @xcite used two distinct methods :",
    "one was based on the measurements of the velocity dispersions of the ngc 5353/4 satellites and the other employed the projected mass estimator given by @xcite .",
    "they took the average over the two estimates to find @xmath43 . recently , however , @xcite has updated @xmath18 to a slightly higher value , @xmath8 . the corresponding virial radius of ngc 5353/4 is determined to be @xmath44 mpc by using the relation of @xmath45^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "adopting the conservative definition of @xcite , we confine the bound - zone of the ngc 5353/4 group to the region enclosed by a spherical shell whose inner and outer radii equal @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .    s. kim et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) recently detected around the ngc 5353/4 group a thin straight filament , which is mainly composed of dwarf galaxies with b - band magnitudes @xmath48 in the redshift range of @xmath49 . noting that the filament is elongated along the direction toward the ngc 5353/4 group and analyzing the line - of - sight velocities of the filament galaxies , s. kim et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) have concluded that the filament is located in the bound zone of the ngc 5353/4 group .",
    "since the majority of the filament galaxies has been found to be the dwarf galaxies , the most gravitational influence that the filament galaxies in the bound zone would feel should come from the ngc 5353/4 group .",
    "information on the comoving distances of @xmath50 member galaxies of the filament are found available at the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "the three - dimensional positions , @xmath51 , of the @xmath50 filament galaxies are determined and their separation displacement vectors @xmath52 from the group center are calculated as @xmath53 .",
    "then , we select only those among the @xmath50 filament galaxies whose separation distances , @xmath54 , satisfy the bound - zone condition of @xmath55 . from here on , the filament galaxies , which have their comoving distances measured and belong to the bound - zone of ngc 5353/4 , are referred to as _ the bound - zone filament galaxies _ of ngc 5353/4",
    ". a total of four bound - zone filament galaxies is selected .",
    "the angle , @xmath56 , at which the radial direction , @xmath57 , of each bound - zone filament galaxy is inclined to the line - of - sight direction of the group center , @xmath58 , can be determined as @xmath59 .",
    "now , the radial velocity of each bound - zone filament galaxy in unita of km s@xmath60 can be evaluated from the measurable inclination angle @xmath56 and the redshift difference @xmath61 between the center of the ngc 5353/4 and its bound - zone filament galaxies , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is basically the line - of - sight velocity of a bound - zone filament galaxy relative to the ngc 5353/4 center .      in section",
    "[ sec : ngc5354 ] we have measured the radial velocities of the bound - zone filament galaxies of ngc 5353/4 from observations .",
    "we are now ready to adjust equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) to this observational result and to eventually estimate the turn - around radius of ngc 5353/4 by equating the rhs of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) to zero .",
    "the adjustable parameter is nothing but the power - law index , @xmath27 , in the rhs of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) . as mentioned in section [ sec : prediction ] , @xcite found @xmath64 from their numerical experiment for the standard flat @xmath0cdm cosmology . without ruling out the possibility that the true universe deviates from the standard flat @xmath0cdm cosmology , it is not unreasonable for us to suspect that the value of @xmath27 might deviate from the estimate of @xcite .",
    "moreover , our previous work has found that , although the functional form of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) itself describes well the reconstructed radial velocity profile of the virgo cluster from observational data , the best agreement is reached when the power - law index @xmath27 has a lower ( negative ) value than @xmath65 @xcite .    varying the power - law index of @xmath27 , we fit the rhs of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) to the measured radial velocities of the bound - zone filament galaxies from information on @xmath56 and @xmath63 ( see eq.([eqn : vlos ] ) ) .",
    "then , we search for the best - fit value of @xmath27 that maximizes the following likelihood function : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is",
    "the reduced chi - square given as @xmath68^{2}\\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath69 denotes the number of the bound - zone filament galaxies , @xmath70 represents the observational radial velocity of the @xmath71th bound - zone filament galaxy with redshift difference @xmath72 and inclination angle @xmath73 estimated by equation ( [ eqn : vlos ] ) , and @xmath74 is the theoretical radial velocity at a separation distance @xmath75 predicted by equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) . note that the degree of freedom @xmath76 equals @xmath77 since equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) has only one adjustable parameter , @xmath27 .",
    "normalizing @xmath78 to satisfy @xmath79 , we plot it as a black solid line in figure [ fig : p_nv ] . as can be seen , the likelihood function @xmath78 reaches its sharp peak at @xmath80 .",
    "the evaluation of the upper and lower errors ( say @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) associated with the best - fit value @xmath83 as @xmath84 yields @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .    now that the best - fit power - law index , @xmath87 , for equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) has been determined , the corresponding turn - around radius @xmath30 can be calculated by equating equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) to zero .",
    "figure [ fig : rt_nv8 ] plots how the turn - around radius varies with the power - law index @xmath27 as a red solid line .",
    "the location of the best - fit value , @xmath83 , and the amount of the associated errors , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , obtained by means of the maximum likelihood method are shown as the black dashed line and gray regions , respectively .",
    "the blue and the green solid lines indicate the locations of the spherical and nonspherical bounds , respectively . projecting the section of the red solid line overlapped with the gray region onto the vertical axis in figure [ fig : rt_nv8 ] allows us to determine the range of the turn - around radius of ngc 5353/4 .",
    "as can be seen , the best - fit value @xmath30 is one @xmath88 higher than the upper bound predicted by the @xmath0cdm model . although the signal of the bound - violation is not so statistically significant less than @xmath89 , we believe that the ngc 5353/4 group is a strong candidate for the bound - violation on the group scale since its best - fit turn - around radius turns out to exceed not only the spherical , but also the non - spherical , upper bound .",
    "we also examine how robust the fitting result is against the change of the bound - zone range from @xmath55 into @xmath90 and into @xmath91 .",
    "the likelihood functions , @xmath78 for these two cases of the bound zone range are shown as red dashed and blue dotted lines , respectively , in figure [ fig : p_nv ] . as can be seen , the change of the bound - zone range produces a thicker tail of @xmath78 in the high @xmath27 section and moves the location of the peak , @xmath83 , to a slightly higher value .",
    "figures [ fig : rt_nv7 ] and [ fig : rt_nv10 ] plot the same as figure [ fig : rt_nv8 ] but for the cases of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , which demonstrate that the change of the bound - zone range enlarges the errors of @xmath30 , but does not alleviate the bound - violation by the ngc 5353/4 group much . table [ tab : nv ] lists the numbers of the bound - zone filament galaxies , the corresponding best - fit power - law index and the resulting ranges of the turn - around radius @xmath30 for three different cases of the bound - zone limit .",
    "our work was inspired and urged by the seminal paper of @xcite which theoretically proved the existence of the maximum turn - around radii , @xmath1 , of massive objects and proposed it as an independent test of the @xmath0cdm model by showing its sensitive dependence on the density and equation of state of dark energy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the current work ,",
    "we have taken a step toward realizing the ingenious idea of @xcite by accomplishing the following .",
    "first , we have devised a new methodology to infer the turn - around radii of galaxy groups / clusters without information on the peculiar velocity field .",
    "based on the numerical finding of @xcite that the radial velocity profile of dark matter particles in the bound zone of massive objects displays universality , this new methodology employs the extrapolation of the universal profile to the turn - around moment at which the radial velocities would vanish .",
    "second , we have applied this new methodology to the nearby galaxy group , ngc 5353/4 , around which a thin straight filament composed mainly of the dwarf galaxies has been detected ( s. kim et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) . assuming that the radial velocity profile of the filament galaxies in the bound zone of ngc 5353/4 follows the universal form well",
    ", we have shown that having information on the spatial positions of the filament galaxies suffices to determine the best - fit value of the characteristic parameter of the profile .",
    "then , we have constrained the ranges of the turn - around radius , @xmath30 , of ngc 5353/4 by locating the separation distance at which the radial velocity profile with the best - fit parameter crosses the zero line .",
    "the comparison of the constrained range of @xmath30 with the theoretical upper bound , @xmath1 , derived by @xcite has led us to detect a @xmath89 signal of the violation of the spherical bound and a @xmath92 signal of the violation of the non - spherical bound .",
    "weak as the signal may appear at first sight , our result is significant because it reports the first case of possible violation of the non - spherical bound on the galaxy group scale .",
    "all of the previously reported cases of the bound - violation occurred on the cluster or supercluster scales but none on the group scale ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "lack of evidence for the bound - violating cases on the galaxy group scale had been interpreted as an indication that the signals of the bound - violation detected on the cluster scale might be spurious ones generated by large uncertainties in the measurements of the virial masses of the clusters as well as the peculiar velocities of their bound - zone galaxies @xcite .",
    "our result provides the first observational counter - evidence against the @xmath0cdm prediction for @xmath1 on the galaxy group scale , which has two crucial implications .",
    "first , the observed signals of the bound - violation on the cluster scale should not be interpreted just as false ones but deserve thorough reinvestigation by making efforts to estimate the turn - around radii more accurately .",
    "second , the turn - around radii of those galaxy groups , which were estimated and found to match the @xmath0cdm prediction well in previous studies @xcite may need to be reestimated without placing too much confidence on the measurements of the peculiar velocities of their bound - zone galaxies .",
    "since the galaxy groups have weaker self - gravity and a smaller number of bound - zone galaxies than the galaxy clusters , it is in fact delicately more difficult to infer their turn - around radii by directly measuring the peculiar velocities of the bound - zone galaxies . our methodology has allowed us to overcome this difficulty , being capable of producing a robust result that is expected to be less severely contaminated by observational errors . yet , as mentioned in @xcite , given the inherent stochastic nature of the structure formation process , it requires more counter - evidence on the galaxy group scale to contest the @xmath0cdm cosmology with the @xmath30 values estimated by our methodology .",
    "we admit that our result may suffer from the poor - number statistics .",
    "only four bound - zone filament galaxies have been used in our analysis to determine the best - fit value of the power - law index of the radial velocity profile around ngc 5353/4 , simply because it is only those four galaxies that already have their comoving distances independently measured .",
    "it would definitely be desirable to measure the comoving distances of more bound - zone filament galaxies of ngc 5353/4 and then to reestimate the best - fit value of the power - law index of the radial velocity profile by using them all , which is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also admit that not all possible errors including hidden systematics have been taken into account to derive our results . for instance",
    ", if the uncertainties in the measurements of the virial mass of ngc 5353/4 and the separation distances to the bound - zone filament galaxies were known and accounted for , the errors in the final estimate of @xmath30 would become larger , which might in turn alleviate the tension with the @xmath0cdm prediction for @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , although the ngc 5353/4 group appears to be located in the low - density environment @xcite , non - negligible difference between the virial and the turn - around masses of ngc 5353/4 may exist and could produce other uncertainties regarding the estimate of its turn - around radius .",
    "recently , @xcite studied how the deviation of gravitational law from the general relativity would affect the value of the maximum turn - around radii and derived a general expression for @xmath1 in modified gravity ( mg ) models from the first principles .",
    "our methodology will be useful to put an independent constraint on the mg models by efficiently estimating the turn - around radii of several nearby galaxy groups and comparing the estimates with the mg predictions given by @xcite .",
    "however , some numerical work has to precede such a test with our methodology . strictly speaking , the functional form of the radial velocity profile ( eq.([eqn : vr ] ) )",
    "empirically drawn by @xcite from @xmath28-body simulations is applicable only for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology and it is not guaranteed that the same functional form can be applied for the cases of mg models .",
    "it will be necessary to investigate if and how not only the value of the power - law index but also the functional form itself of the radial velocity profile of the bound - zone galaxies differs from equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) in mg models",
    ". we plan to work on this project as well as on testing the robustness of the current result by using more improved data sets .",
    "we hope to report the result elsewhere in the near future .",

    "<S> the first observational evidence for the violation of the maximum turn - around radius on the galaxy group scale is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the ngc 5353/4 group is chosen as an ideal target for our investigation of the bound - violation because of its proximity , low - density environment , optimal mass scale , and existence of a nearby thin straight filament . using the observational data on the line - of - sight velocities and three - dimensional distances of the filament galaxies located in the bound zone of the ngc 5353/4 group , we construct their radial velocity profile as a function of separation distance from the group center and then compare it to the analytic formula obtained empirically by @xcite to find the best - fit value of an adjustable parameter with the help of the maximum likelihood method . </S>",
    "<S> the turn - around radius of ngc 5353/4 is determined to be the separation distance where the adjusted analytic formula for the radial velocity profile yields zero . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated turn - around radius of ngc 5353/4 turns out to substantially exceed the upper limit predicted by the spherical model based on the @xmath0cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> even when the restrictive condition of spherical symmetry is released , the estimated value is found to be only marginally consistent with the @xmath0cdm expectation . </S>"
