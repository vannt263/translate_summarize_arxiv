    "birkhoff  @xcite introduced the problem of _ convex billiard tables _",
    "more than 80 years ago as a way to describe the motion of a free particle inside a closed convex smooth curve .",
    "the particle is reflected at the boundary according to the law `` angle of incidence equals angle of reflection '' .",
    "good modern starting points in the literature of the billiard problem are  @xcite .",
    "_ caustics _",
    "curves with the property that a billiard trajectory , once tangent to it , stays tangent after every reflection are the most distinctive geometric objects inside billiard tables , since they are a geometric manifestation of the regularity of their tangent trajectories .",
    "for example , integrable billiards have a continuum of caustics , whereas the nonexistence of caustics inside a convex billiard table implies that there are some billiard trajectories whose past and future behaviours differ dramatically .",
    "see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "hence , the existence and persistence of caustics are two fundamental questions in billiards .",
    "most of the literature deals with convex caustics , since they are easier to understand and related to ordered trajectories .",
    "two exceptions are  @xcite and  @xcite .    we summarize the classical existence results as follows",
    ". on the one hand , if the boundary curve is smooth enough and strictly convex , then there exists a collection of smooth convex caustics close to the boundary of the table whose union has positive area  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", mather  @xcite proved that there are no smooth convex caustics inside a convex billiard table when its boundary curve has some flat point .",
    "gutkin and katok  @xcite gave a quantitative version of mather s theorem .",
    "the robustness of a smooth convex caustic is closely related to the arithmetic properties of its _ rotation number _ , which measures the number of turns around the caustic per impact . caustics with diophantine rotation numbers persist under small perturbations of the boundary curve .",
    "this follows from standard kam arguments  @xcite . on the contrary , _ resonant caustics _",
    "the ones whose tangent trajectories are closed polygons , so that their rotation numbers are rational are fragile structures that generically break up .",
    "see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "this raises two complementary questions .",
    "first , to characterize the perturbations that preserve / destroy a given resonant caustic of a billiard table .",
    "second , to determine all resonant caustics that are preserved / destroyed under a given perturbation of an integrable billiard table .",
    "these questions have been studied by several authors .",
    "baryshnikov and zharnitsky  @xcite proved that the perturbations preserving a given resonant caustic of a smooth convex billiard table form an infinite - dimensional hilbert manifold .",
    "as a sample , we point out that this hilbert manifold is given by the set of billiard tables with constant width when the rotation number of the unperturbed caustic is one half  @xcite . concerning the second question",
    ", ramrez - ros  @xcite gave a sufficient condition for the break - up of the resonant circular caustics inside a circular billiard table , in terms of the fourier coefficients of the perturbation , see remark  [ rem : circles ] below .",
    "in this paper we tackle the second question when the billiard boundary is an ellipse . in that case , the billiard dynamics is integrable and any billiard trajectory has a caustic  @xcite .",
    "the caustics are the conics confocal to the original ellipse : confocal ellipses , confocal hyperbolas , and the foci .",
    "poncelet  @xcite showed that if a billiard trajectory inside an ellipse is a closed polygon , then all the billiard trajectories sharing its caustic are also closed polygons .",
    "even more , if a billiard trajectory tangent to one of the elliptical caustics is a _ @xmath0-gon _",
    "a closed polygon with @xmath1 sides that makes @xmath2 turns around its caustic , then all the billiard trajectories sharing its caustic are also @xmath0-gons , and their caustic is called _ @xmath0-resonant_. (",
    "these two definitions are not restricted to billiards inside ellipses . )",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : ellipse ] that there is a unique @xmath0-resonant elliptical caustic for any relatively prime integers @xmath2 and @xmath1 such that @xmath3 .",
    "our main result is that all these resonant elliptical caustics break up under a large class of explicit perturbations of the original ellipse , see theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] .",
    "the following notations are required to state the main result .",
    "once fixed the ellipse @xmath4 we consider its associated elliptic coordinates @xmath5 given by the relations @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the semifocal distance of @xmath8 .",
    "the equation of the ellipse @xmath8 in this elliptic coordinates is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "hence , any smooth perturbation @xmath12 of the ellipse @xmath8 can be written in elliptic coordinates as @xmath13 for some @xmath14-periodic smooth function @xmath15 .",

    "our proof is based on the study of the persistence of the resonant rotational invariant circles ( resonant rics ) of some twist maps by means of a first - order melnikov method .",
    "only convex caustics can be related to the rics of those twist maps .",
    "thus , there is no direct way to extend the same procedure to the nonconvex caustic hyperbolas , but we believe that the same results hold for them .",
    "[ rem : higherorder ] if @xmath15 is constant , then the perturbed curves @xmath12 are ellipses , so all caustics ( resonant or not ) are preserved .",
    "hence , the hypothesis @xmath16 nonconstant is natural , since we are using a first - order method .",
    "nevertheless , we can still state some results when this hypothesis fails . more precisely , let us assume that @xmath19 for some @xmath20 and some nonconstant @xmath14-periodic entire function @xmath21 . then :    * if @xmath1 is odd , all the @xmath0-resonant elliptical caustics with odd @xmath1 break up .",

    "if @xmath1 is even , we believe that all @xmath0-resonant elliptical caustics also break up , even if @xmath27 is @xmath18-antiperiodic , but we should use a second - order melnikov method in order to prove it . unfortunately , the computations become too cumbersome .",

    "[ rem : circles ] the case of perturbed circular tables was studied using similar techniques in  @xcite , but the final result was quite different .",

    "this section is a generalization of  @xcite , although several hypotheses have been weakened .",

    "although functions  ( [ eq : potentialellipses ] ) and  ( [ eq : potentialcircles ] ) look quite similar , they hide a crucial difference .",
    "there is a simple formula for the @xmath281 angles , but not for the @xmath282 ones .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the billiard trajectories inside a circle of radius @xmath31 sharing a circular caustic with radius @xmath283 have a rigid angular dynamics of the form @xmath284 . on the contrary",
    ", such a rigid angular dynamics does not take place for elliptic tables when the angle @xmath285 is considered , which is a source of technical difficulties in the study of the subharmonic melnikov potential  ( [ eq : potentialellipses ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to define a new angular parameter @xmath286 over the ellipse @xmath8 in such a way that all billiard trajectories inside @xmath8 sharing the elliptical caustic @xmath224 have a rigid angular dynamics of the form @xmath287 , for some constant shift @xmath288 .",
    "we need some notations on elliptic functions in order to define this angular parameter @xmath286 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a general background on elliptic functions . given a quantity @xmath289 , called the _ modulus _ , then @xmath290 is the _ complete elliptic integral of the first kind_. we also write @xmath291 .",
    "the _ amplitude _",
    "function @xmath292 is defined through the inversion of the integral @xmath293 then the _ elliptic sinus _ and the _ elliptic cosinus _ are defined by the trigonometric relations @xmath294 respectively .",
    "dependence on the modulus is denoted by a comma preceding it , so we can write @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 to avoid any confusion . in the following lemma",
    "it is stated that the angular dynamics becomes rigid in the angular parameter @xmath286 given by @xmath298 .",
    "it suffices to find the suitable modulus @xmath299 for each elliptical caustic @xmath224 .",
    "[ lem : changfriedberg ] once fixed any caustic parameter @xmath228 , we set the modulus @xmath300 and the constant shift @xmath301 by the formulae @xmath302 where @xmath192 is the angle such that @xmath303 .",
    "let @xmath304 be any billiard trajectory inside the ellipse @xmath8 with caustic @xmath224",
    ". then @xmath305 .    by definition ,",
    "@xmath306 , so @xmath307 .",
    "these integrals are equal to a constant @xmath26 that depends only on @xmath224 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the formula for the constant shift is given in  @xcite .",
    "remark that if @xmath308 then the modulus @xmath299 is equal to zero , the complete elliptic integral @xmath309 is equal to @xmath310 , the amplitude function is the identity , the elliptic sinus / cosinus are the usual sinus / cosinus , the shift @xmath311 is given by @xmath283 , and the dynamical relation @xmath305 becomes @xmath312 .",
    "thus , we recover the known rigid angular dynamics for circular tables as a limit of the formulae for elliptic tables .    from now on , @xmath299 and @xmath26 will denote the modulus and the constant shift defined in  ( [ eq : modulusshift ] ) .",
    "thus , we shall skip the dependence of the elliptic functions on the modulus .",
    "we note that @xmath224 has eccentricity @xmath299 .",
    "besides , @xmath224 is the @xmath0-resonant elliptical caustic if and only if @xmath313 this identity has the following geometric interpretation . when a billiard trajectory makes one turn around @xmath224 , the old angular variable @xmath285 changes by @xmath14 , so the new angular variable @xmath286 changes by @xmath314 .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that the variable @xmath286 changes by @xmath26 when a billiard trajectory bounces once .",
    "hence , a billiard trajectory inscribed in @xmath8 and circumscribed around @xmath224 makes exactly @xmath2 turns around @xmath224 after @xmath1 bounces if and only if  ( [ eq : resonantcondition ] ) holds .",
