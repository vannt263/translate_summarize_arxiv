    "we consider an additional mechanism connected with the possibility of a simultaneous production of two strings .",
    "this happens due to the complicated nature of the photon , which can interact as a hadron - like system consisting of a quark and an antiquark with a gluonic field of the nucleon ( pomeron ) and by means of quark - antiquark exchange ( reggeons ) .",
    "diagrams describing the mechanism of the high energy hadron - hadron interaction in regge theory are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the surfaces of planar and cylindrical diagrams are covered by gluons and quark - antiquark pairs , which do not represented for the sake of simplicity .",
    "= 6.cm    one should note , that the reggeon exchange leads to a one string picture as in fig.1 , whereas pomeron exchange leads to a two string mechanism of hadron production .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the contribution of the two string events in an electro - production on nuclei . for this purpose",
    "we investigate the nuclear attenuation ( na ) , which is the ratio of the differential multiplicity on a nucleus ( a ) to that on deuterium ( d ) .",
    "the experimentally measured observable , na , is usually considered as a function of three kinematical variables : energy of the virtual photon @xmath0 , fraction of photon s energy carried by final hadron @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of hadron in laboratory system and square of the four momentum of photon @xmath3 @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the number of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given @xmath6 bin , and @xmath7 being the number of inclusive dis leptons in the same @xmath8 bin .",
    "however , we consider @xmath9 as a function of two variables , @xmath8 or @xmath10 , which assumes that integration over the third kinematic variable is done . as it has been shown , the contribution of the two string mechanism in @xmath9 is negligible at @xmath11 .",

    "+ now , let us turn to the electro - production process , when one is dealing with the virtual photon interaction .",
    "the phenomenological model which extends vmd to the case of the virtual photon is the generalized vmd ( gvmd )  @xcite . in this case",

    "when a string is stretched , it decays into hadrons by breaking into short strings . the dominant contribution to",
    "the high energy scattering of two hadrons comes from a closed string ( a pomeron ) exchange , having a cylinder topology ( see fig.2c ) .",
    "a unitarity cut of the cylindrical pomeron shows that the sources of the multi - particle production are two hadronic chains ( see fig.2d ) .",
    "other reggeons correspond to the planar diagrams , which give one hadronic chain in the multiparticle production .",

    "we will discuss such choice later in results and discussion .",
    "using quantities defined in the preceding sections and the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can now calculate the na , taking into account the admixture of the two string events . in order to do this ,",

    "are obtained with @xmath84 in form eq.(14 ) .",
    "on figs.3 and 6 the na in the framework of tsm with @xmath89 ( lund model ) are marked as in ref .",
    "in particular , @xmath90 and @xmath89 means that @xmath91 is taken in form eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) of the referred paper . ]",
    "solid curves represent single string case , while other curves represent cases with admixture of the two string events .",
    "the fraction of the two string events depends from the value of @xmath13 .",
    "dotted curves correspond @xmath92 , dashed @xmath93 and dashed - dotted @xmath94 . in figs . 4 and 7 the na in the framework of the itsm with @xmath89 are presented .",
    "figures 5 and 8 show the na in the framework of itsm with @xmath90 ( leading hadron ) .",
    "let us now discuss the results of calculations .",
    "first of all one should note several common features of the results : a ) admixture of two string events always increases the effect of nuclear attenuation , i.e. increases gap between unity and value of @xmath9 ; b ) contribution of the two string events increases with the increase of the atomic mass number ; c ) contribution of the two string events also increases with larger values of @xmath0 , and decreases with the larger values of @xmath88 ; d ) @xmath88-dependence is more sensitive to the contribution of the two string events than the @xmath0-dependence . from figs .",
    "3 to 8 one can see that the contribution of the two string events is negligible for all nuclei at @xmath11 . at moderate @xmath13 it becomes more essential .",
    "for instance at @xmath95 , which corresponds to the hermes kinematics , the contribution of the two string events in @xmath88-dependence on krypton achieves   3 - 4% .",
    "for @xmath96 it increases to 5 - 6% ( as an observable we use the na ratio @xmath9 . if nuclear effects are absent , it is obviously equal to unity .",
    "the quantity directly connected with the nuclear effects is @xmath97 .",
    "the relative contribution of the two string events in this quantity is several times larger than in @xmath9 . ) .",
    "3 to 8 also show that the contribution of the two string events is always small for helium . comparing figs .",
    "3 - 5 with figs . 6 - 8",
    "one can see that the calculations with functions @xmath84 defined in equations ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) give results that are close in shape , however the contribution of two string events calculated with @xmath84 as in eq.(12 ) is more significant numerically .",
    "we have performed an additional test for the probability function of the energy division @xmath98 .",
    "besides the eq.(14 ) we also used an expression @xmath69 = const ; and also a combined expression when constant value of @xmath99 was used for close values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 and eq.(14 ) was used for the case @xmath78 . changing the expressions for @xmath99 leads to slight change of the form of the curves , but does not change the contribution level significantly . in this paper",
    "we have limited ourself to consideration of na for pions only , but the described mechanism of the two string admixture is common for all mesons and baryons , and extension is quite straightforward .",
    "we have studied the two string admixture in the framework of the string model , but in any model that deals with the na there is a need to take into account the fact that the virtual photon can transfer its energy both single parton and to two partons .",
    "the last point which we would like to discuss is what happens if , instead of a single string fit of the na data ( performed in  @xcite ) , we perform a fit including two string admixture to the single string mechanism .",
    "we do not expect that the numerical values of the fitting parameters and @xmath100 will change significantly .",
    "fitting parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 in tsm and @xmath101 and c in itsm , should become slightly smaller ( in order of @xmath103 ) , and all curves should have a somewhat smoother behavior ( definitions of free parameters see in ref .",
    "*   for the first time the contribution of two string events in the na was investigated .",
    "admixture of the two string events always increases the effect of na , i.e. increases gap between unity and @xmath9 value . *",
    "contribution of two string events increases with the increasing of the atomic mass number ; as well as with the increasing of @xmath0 , and decreases with the increasing of @xmath88 .",
    "it is more prominent in the @xmath88-dependence .",
    "*   at moderate @xmath13 contribution of the two string events is essential enough .",
    "for instance in the @xmath88-dependence on krypton it is approximately 5 - 6% at @xmath96 ,   3 - 4% at @xmath95 .",
    "it is negligible for all nuclei at @xmath11 . *",
    "it is very interesting to investigate the contribution of two string events in case of double hadron production  @xcite ,  @xcite",
