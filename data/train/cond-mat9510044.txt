    "the effect of electron  electron ( @xmath2 ) interactions on transport in bulk - like systems of various dimensionalities is still an area of active research to this day , both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite . on the face of it , it would seem that in the case of doped parabolic band semiconductors where umklapp processes are negligible , @xmath2 scattering should not affect the linear transport properties of bulk - like systems ( purely quantum effects such as weak - localization corrections excepted ) since an @xmath2 scattering event conserves the total current in the system . nevertheless , it has been appreciated for a long time that @xmath2 scattering _ can _ affect the mobility of a system semiclassically by scattering carriers into or out of parts of the brillouin zone which are strongly affected by the other available scattering mechanisms.@xcite    in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the expression for mobility in the presence of quasi - elastic scatters takes on different forms in the limits of zero and infinitely strong @xmath2 scattering .",
    "given a quasi - elastic energy - dependent transport ( i.e. , calculated with the @xmath3 term ) scattering time @xmath4 due to other scattering processes in the system such as acoustic phonons or impurities , the mobilities of the system for the cases of zero and infinite @xmath2 scattering rates , respectively , are given by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the carrier density of the system , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath9 is the dimensionality of the system , and we are assuming an isotropic parabolic band system . clearly , for the case when that temperature @xmath0 is small on the scale of the energy scale over which @xmath4 varies significantly , @xmath10^{-1}$ ] .",
    "conversely , in the case where @xmath0 is large on the scale over which @xmath4 varies , there can be significant differences in the calculated mobility using the two different methods .",
    "for example , we show below that in particular cases in gaas quantum wells , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , for accurate theoretical determination of the mobility at the semiclassical level , it is important that @xmath2 scattering effects are included . furthermore , it has been shown@xcite that experiments measuring the drag rate between electron gases between two coupled quantum wells is sensitive of the exact details of the linear response distribution function @xmath12 in each layer . since",
    "@xmath12 is strongly affected by @xmath2 scattering in the intermediate temperature regime @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the fermi temperature ) , it is important to include the effects of @xmath2 scattering in calculations of the drag rate .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate an efficient way of including @xmath2 scattering in the calculation of for linear transport for two - dimensional cylindrically symmetric systems , within the semiclassical boltzmann equation formalism .",
    "a similar calculation has been presented in three - dimensions.@xcite within this formalism , the boltzmann equation for linear response can be solved exactly ( within numerical accuracy ) .",
    "we have included full effects of finite - temperature dynamical screening , which automatically includes phenomena such as landau damping and collective mode enhancements to scattering .",
    "the description of the @xmath2 scattering formalism for the boltzmann equation is given in sections [ sec : formal ] and [ sec : scatop ] , and section [ sec : results ] contains the results and discussion . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that bands are isotropic and parabolic .",
    "the @xmath2 scattering occurs in the presence of other conduction electrons , and hence the bare interparticle coulomb interaction @xmath15 is screened .",
    "furthermore , at the intermediate temperatures in which we are interested , the energy transfer between the electrons in a scattering event is often a substantial fraction of the kinetic energy of the electrons , and hence the scattering matrix elements for @xmath2 interactions should be calculated using the _ dynamically _ screened coulomb interaction @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dielectric function . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath17 given by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which we evaluate using a method described previously by us,@xcite and we use the born approximation for the scattering probability .    the scattering probability @xmath18 for a pair of electrons",
    "initially in states @xmath19 to be scattered to @xmath20 depends on whether or not the electrons have the same or opposite spins . for electrons with the same spin ,",
    "say @xmath21 , @xmath22 the fraction @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ likespin ] ) is due to double counting , since @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe exactly the same process . for opposite spins , @xmath26 there is an equal probability that an electron scatters off another electron with equal or opposite spin , so one can sum over the eqs .",

    "( [ averagew ] ) referred to as the direct and exchange terms , respecitively .    in practice",
    ", the exchange term often makes calculations considerably more complicated and is usually ignored .",
    "the physical grounds for doing so are as follows .",
    "first , @xmath2 collisions are usually dominated by small @xmath28 scattering ( because @xmath29 falls quickly with @xmath28 for finite @xmath30 ) .",
    "the direct [ exchange ] term has the form @xmath31 [ @xmath32 with @xmath33 , which implies that the direct term usually dominates over the exchange .",
    "also , the sign of exchange term can sometimes be negative , which leads to cancellation of this term within collision integral .",
    "the effect of the exchange term was studied in a 3d system with scatically screened interaction.@xcite there it was found that the exchange term was significant for @xmath34 but not for @xmath35 . in the calculations that follows",
    "we have used @xmath36 , and since we furthermore include dynamical screening , which leads to a peaked interaction at small @xmath28 , we can assume that the direct interaction dominates in our case .",
    "we write down the formal expressions for the electron  electron scattering operator both including and excluding the exchange term .",
    "however , in the actual numerical evaluation , we ignore the exchange interaction .",
    "the boltzmann equation for electrons in uniform electric field @xmath37 producing a force @xmath38 is @xmath39 where the subscripts @xmath40 and p , i are for scattering due to electron ",

    ", we show the deviation function @xmath111 for a fixed density @xmath112 and temperature @xmath113 , but with several different distances @xmath9 of the ionized impurities from the center of the quantum well .",
    "note that when the distribution is a drifted fermi - dirac function , @xmath114 .",
    "thus , as the impurities are moved further away , the impurity scattering becomes weaker and the @xmath2 scattering starts to dominate@xcite and drive the distribution function closer to a drifted fermi - dirac function .",
    "the inset shows @xmath47 calculated both including and excluding electron  electron scattering for @xmath115 , which shows more clearly the effect of @xmath2 on @xmath47 .",
    "while transport experiments in a single layer are not particularly dependent on the details of the shape of @xmath47 , it has been shown@xcite that drag experiments in coupled quantum wells are quite sensitive to the details of @xmath47 . in particular , when @xmath47 rises faster than @xmath116 ( which implies that there are more carriers in the high energy region than for a drifted fermi - dirac distribution ) , the drag rate increases because high energy particles give a larger contribution to the overall drag rate , and there is greater opportunity for coupling to the plasmons of the system , which also enhances the drag rate .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of calculating the drag rate in coupled quantum wells in intermediate temperatures , it is crucial to calculate the actual form of @xmath47 accurately , including all salient scattering mechanisms .",
    "2 shows the mobility @xmath117 as a function of ionized impurity distance @xmath9 from the center of the quantum well .",
    "also shown are the mobilities @xmath118 and @xmath119 , for the limits of zero and infinite electron  electron scattering , respectively .",

    "runaway \" electrons with large velocities ( where the impurity scattering rate is small ) back into lower velocity states .",

    "as @xmath9 becomes larger , the @xmath2 scattering dominates over all other scattering mechanisms and @xmath122 .",
    "conversely , for small @xmath9 , the impurity scattering is relatively large compared to the electron scattering , and @xmath117 is closer to the @xmath120 than @xmath121 .",
