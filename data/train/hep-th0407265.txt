    "whereas the addition of charge makes the critical length , at which the instability arises , shorter in our case making the string `` more unstable'' while longer ( and the extremal case marginally stable ) in @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a marked different is likely due to the interaction with a magnetic field in @xcite while an electric field in the present case .",
