    "the present - day galaxy population has a bimodal color distribution , with a genuine lack of green valley galaxies ( strateva et al .",
    "2001 ; baldry et al .",
    "this dearth of green valley galaxies , coupled with the increase in quiescent galaxies since @xmath3 , implies that galaxies quench star formation ( sf ) and transition rapidly from blue to red optical colors ( bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "thus far , it is not clear if , or how , agn feedback plays a role in this rapid quenching ( springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ) , though there is some circumstantial evidence that supports the agn - driven sf quenching scenario .",

    "( 2007 ) have found that agns predominantly reside in green valley galaxies , but direct evidence ( e.g. , a galaxy where the agn is clearly responsible for the expulsion of starforming material ) has been scarce .",
    "however , the recent discovery of a massive molecular outflow likely driven by an agn in the early - type galaxy ngc  1266 may be a rare example of a galaxy transitioning from the blue to red sequence .",
    "ngc 1266 is thus a promising local laboratory for studying agn - driven sf quenching .",
    "ngc  1266 is a nearby ( @xmath4 mpc ) field early - type galaxy that co observations have shown to harbor a compact molecular disk ( @xmath5 pc@xmath6 ) and a mass - loaded ( @xmath7 ; @xmath8 yr@xmath9 ) molecular outflow ( alatalo et al .",
