    "the schensted correspondence  @xcite is a bijection between permutations and pairs of standard young tableaux of the same shape .",
    "it has been extended in numerous ways , the most famous being certainly the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence between matrices of integers and pairs of semi - standard tableaux of the same shape .",
    "other extensions exist , for instance oscillating tableaux @xcite , skew tableaux  @xcite , shifted young tableaux  @xcite , and @xmath0-ribbon tableaux  @xcite .",
    "sergey fomin developed a general theory of such correspondences , cf .",
    "@xcite . it unifies the correspondences listed above by interpreting these tableaux as paths in so - called _",
    "graded graphs_. for instance , a young tableau in this context is viewed as a particular kind of path in the graph whose vertices are integer partitions , and where @xmath1 is an edge if @xmath2 is a partition obtained after adding @xmath3 to a part of @xmath4 . this graph is usually called the young graph ( or young lattice ) .",
    "other combinatorial objects can be then represented by considering other paths , for instance by modifying the extreme points of the path , or the edges that one can use .",
    "this is a way of looking at oscillating or skew tableaux inside the young graph for instance .",
    "then the local properties of the graph will give rise to various bijective correspondences , all consequences of one elementary bijection .",
    "furthermore , fomin gives in parallel a linear algebraic approach to his results , which is directly inspired by the work of stanley @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "most of fomin s results have both a bijective and an algebraic proof .",
    "in  @xcite , dennis white describes another extension of the schensted correspondence for _ ribbon tableaux _ where ribbons are allowed to have different sizes ; his goal was in fact to give a combinatorial proof of the second orthogonality relation for characters of the symmetric group .",
    "the algorithm describing his correspondence is a complicated insertion mechanism , along the lines of the original schensted correspondence ; this forces him moreover to put some restrictions on the ribbon tableaux he considers .",
    "we will show here how the approaches of fomin both bijective and algebraic can be adapted to apply to the correspondence of white .",
    "there will be two benefits : first , this will extend the original work of white , by getting rid of his restrictions in particular .",
    "second , in the process we will have to extend fomin s setting to graphs which are more general than the ones considered in  @xcite .",
    "note that we will deal here with _ signed enumerations _ , meaning that we will count objects with weights plus or minus one .",
    "it will appear that , for the bijective approach , we will have to appeal to the famous _ involution principle _ of garsia and milne  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : rib ] we give the main definitions about ribbons and ribbon tableaux , as well as some elementary operations on these objects . in section  [",
    "sect : sign ] we define different notions about signed enumeration , and we recall the famous involution principle of garsia and milne .",
    "section  [ sect : hook ] introduces hook permutations and involutions , which are the objects in correspondence with ribbon tableaux in our main results .",
    "section  [ sect : results ] states these results , which are theorems [ th : bij_perm ] and  [ th : bij_invol ] : there exists a signed bijection between hook permutations and pairs of ribbon tableaux of the same shape . the description of the bijections is given in the two following sections : in section  [ sect : local ] we recall some local rules that depend on the operations introduced in section [ sect : rib ] , and section  [ sect : bij ] shows how to define a global correspondence from these local rules .",
    "the technical parts of the proofs are given in appendix [ sect : appa ] . in section  [",
    "sect : alg ] an algebraic version of theorem  [ th : bij_perm ] is given .",
    "section  [ sect : char ] contains an application of theorem  [ th : bij_invol ] to the column sums of the character table of the symmetric group .",

    "we now have all the functions verifying the involution principle of garsia and milne : this gives us a signed bijection between hook permutations and pairs of ribbon tableaux that verifies exactly the properties of theorem [ th : bij_perm ] , which completes the proof .",
    "we will use here the definitions used in the proof of theorem  [ th : bij_perm ] , and adapt them to the case of involutions .",
    "we consider a total order @xmath642 on @xmath643 , the half grid made of the squares @xmath183 of @xmath293 with @xmath644 , and suppose that this order extends the order @xmath645 , defined by @xmath298 if @xmath646 and @xmath300 as seen before .",
    "this induces a partial order on the squares of @xmath293 , given by : @xmath183 is smaller than @xmath515 if and only if @xmath647 is smaller than @xmath648 for @xmath642 .",
    "we will still note @xmath642 this partial order .",
    "we consider configurations as in definition  [ def : conf ] , with the exception that the order @xmath642 is now used .",
    "a configuration @xmath624 on @xmath293 is called _ symmetric _ if @xmath649 and @xmath622 are all symmetric with respect to the diagonal @xmath201 , and we name _ half - configuration _ the restriction to @xmath643 of a symmetric configuration . note that the border @xmath126 of a half - configuration consists of a path form the top left corner of @xmath643 to any vertex of the diagonal @xmath201 .",
    "figure  [ fig : growth_diagram_invol ] shows an example of half configuration .      for a half configuration , _ applying a local rule _ in the square @xmath650 means applying it in both @xmath183 and @xmath651 in the associated symmetric configuration , and restrict the result to @xmath643 .",
    "note that local rules in @xmath183 and @xmath651 will give the same outputs since all our local rules are symmetric in @xmath2 and @xmath247 .",
    "we represent ribbon tableaux by a chain of partitions on the top side of @xmath643 , and hook involutions by the restriction of their matrix representation to @xmath643 with @xmath57 labeling the vertices on the left .",
    "the _ content _ @xmath7 of a symmetric configuration is of the form @xmath652 , so we define the _ content _ of the associated half configuration as @xmath7 .",
    "sign _ of a half configuration @xmath653 is the product of all the signs labeling @xmath126 , multiplied by the product of the signs of hooks appearing in the square @xmath654 .",
    "note that this gives the desired sign on @xmath205 and on ribbon tableaux , so that we are indeed in the setting of theorem  [ th : bij_invol ] .",
    "let us note @xmath655 and @xmath656 the sets of half configurations with associated symmetric configurations in @xmath638 and @xmath639 respectively , with the partial order @xmath642 .",
    "we define the involutions on @xmath655 and @xmath656 in the same fashion as for @xmath638 and @xmath639 , as well as the bijection between @xmath655 and @xmath656 .      for the non diagonal squares @xmath183 with @xmath657 , everything works as before : the application of a rule @xmath29 or @xmath547 changes the sign , whereas the other rules preserve it .",
    "now there remains the application of a rule on a diagonal square @xmath313 .",
    "first we notice that only rules d1-d3 and i1-i3 can be applied there , since they are the only rules with @xmath658 .",
    "one needs to prove that the sign of the ribbon on the left side of @xmath313 , times the sign of the hook in @xmath313 in the case of d2 , is equal to the sign of the ribbon on the top side of @xmath313 .",
    "this is trivial for the rule d1 . for the rules d2 and d3 ,",
    "one has to look at the definition of @xmath93 and @xmath659 ( section  [ subsect : oper ] ) : @xmath660 is of the same height as @xmath254 by definition , and thus of the same sign : this implies that rule d2 will indeed have the sign preserving property . for the rule d3 , @xmath661is a ribbon of the same height as @xmath23 , and so of the same sign , which implies here also that the rule preserves the sign .",
    "the involution principle can thus be applied , and this achieves the proof of theorem  [ th : bij_invol ] ."
