    "cooperation is ubiquitous in real world , ranging from biological systems to economic and social systems @xcite .",
    "however , the unselfish , altruistic actions apparently contradict darwinian selection .",
    "thus , understanding the conditions for the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior among selfish individuals is a central problem @xcite .",
    "game theory together with its extensions @xcite , considered to be an important approach , provides a useful framework for investigating this problem .",
    "two simple games , prisoners dilemma game ( pdg ) @xcite and snowdrift game ( sg ) @xcite , as metaphors for characterizing the evolution of cooperative behavior have drawn much attention from not only social but also biological and physical scientists @xcite . in the original pdg ,",
    "each of two players may chose either to cooperate or defect in any one encounter .",
    "if they both cooperate , both obtain a payoff of @xmath1 , whereas mutual defection results in pay - off @xmath2 for both players . if one player defects while the other cooperates , defector gains the biggest pay - off @xmath3 , while cooperator gets @xmath4 .",
    "the ranking of four pay - off values is @xmath5 .",
    "the sg is a game of much biologically interesting .",
    "this game differs from the pdg mainly in the order of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , as @xmath6 , which are more favorable to sustain cooperative behavior",
    ".    however , in these two games , the unstable cooperative behavior is opposite to the observations in the real world .",
    "this disagreement thus motivates a variety of suitable extensions of basic model rules to explain the emergence of cooperation .",
    "some previous works have suggested that the introduction of  tit - for - tat \" @xcite strategy can remarkably enhance the cooperative behavior .",
    "more recently , nowak and may @xcite found that the pdg with simple spatial structure can induce the emergence of cooperation , and in particular , spatial chaos is observed .",
    "in contrast , the work of hauert and doebeli @xcite demonstrates the spatial structure often inhibits the evolution of cooperation in the sg .",
    "inspired by the idea of spatial game , much attention has been given to the interplay between evolutionary cooperative behavior and the underlying structure @xcite .",
    "since the surprising discovery of  small world \" @xcite and  scale - free \" @xcite structural properties in real networked systems , evolutionary games are naturally considered on the networks with these two kinds of structural features @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is found that comparing with the square lattices , scale - free networks provide a unifying framework for the emergency of cooperation @xcite .    in the two games with network structure , such as square lattices ( spatial structure ) , small world and scale - free structure ,",
    "players interact only with their immediate neighbors . in each round , the score of each individual is the sum of the payoffs in the encounters with its neighbors . at the next generation , all the individuals could update their strategies ( cooperate or defect ) synchronously according to either the deterministic rule introduced by nowak and may @xcite or the stochastic evolutionary rule by szab and tke @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the pdg and sg on scale - free networks mainly according to the stochastic update rules . however , we argue that such as in the social system , individual may not completely randomly choose a neighbor to learn from it . ",
    "rich gets richer \" is a common feature in social and natural system , which reveals the existence of preferential mechanism .",
    "it is indeed the preferential attachment mechanism of barabsi and albert model ( ba for short ) @xcite leads to the scale - free structural property in good accord with the empirical observations .",
    "thus , in the present work , we present a preferential learning rule , the probability of which is governed by a single parameter , for better mimicking the evolution of real world system .",
    "the probability of choosing a neighbor for each individual depends on the degree of that neighbor .",
    "this assumption takes into account that the status of individuals can be reflected by the degree of them in various communities in nature and society , e.g. the leader usually interacts with large quantities of individuals .",
    "interestingly , we find that the preferential learning mechanism promotes the cooperative behavior of both the pdg and sg .",
    "several attractive properties for some specific parameter values are observed , such as the @xmath0-like noise of evolutionary cooperator density for both two games , which indicates the long range correlation of cooperation . in the sg , for some specific cases",
    ", the degree of cooperation displays a punctuated equilibrium - type behavior instead of steady state .",
    "in contrast , the pdg exhibits an absolutely different property of sudden jumps of cooperation .",
    "these two distinct behaviors are both attributed to the effect of leaders , i.e. the individuals with large connectivity .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the following section we describe the model in detail , in sec .",
    "iii simulations and analysis are provided for both the pdg and sg , and in sec .",
    "iv the work is concluded .",
    "we first construct the scale - free networks using the ba model which is considered to be the most simple and general one . starting from @xmath7 fully connected nodes , one node with @xmath8 links is attached at each time step in such a way that the probability @xmath9 of being connected to the existing node @xmath10 is proportional to the degree @xmath11 of that node , i.e. , @xmath12 with summation over all the existing nodes . here , we set @xmath13 and network size @xmath14 for all simulations .",
    "the degree distribution of ba networks follows a power law @xmath15@xcite .",
    "we consider the evolutionary pdg and sg on the networks . without losing generality",
    ", we investigate the simplified games with a single payoff parameter following previous works @xcite .",
    "figure ( 1 ) illustrates the encounter payoffs of both the pdg and sg .",
    "each individual is placed on a node of the network and plays the games only with their immediate neighbors simultaneously .",
    "the total payoff of each player is the sum over all its encounters .",

    "while two defectors @xmath17 encounter , both earn 0 .",
    "when a cooperator encounters a defector , the defector earns @xmath18 and the cooperator 0 . in the sg",
    ", it is the same as pdg when two cooperators or defectors encounter .",
    "however , when a cooperator meets a defector the cooperator scores @xmath19 and the defector scores @xmath20.,title=\"fig : \" ]    during the evolutionary process , each player is allowed to learn from one of its neighbors and update its strategy in each round . as mentioned early ,",
    "each player chooses a neighbor according to the preferential learning rule , i.e. , the probability @xmath21 of @xmath10 selecting a neighbor @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a tunable parameter and the sum runs over the neighbors of @xmath10 .",
    "one can see when @xmath24 equals zero , the neighbor is randomly selected so that the game is reduced to the original one . while in the case of @xmath25 , the individuals with large degree have advantages to be selected ; otherwise , the small degree individuals have larger probability to be selected . in social and natural systems ,",
    "some individuals with high status and reputation may have much stronger influence than others and the status of individuals can be reflected by the degree of them .",
    "thus , the introduction of the preferential learning intends to characterize the effect of influential individuals on the evolution of cooperation . in parallel",
    ", we also investigate the performance of the systems with tendency of learning from the individuals with small degree .    after choosing a neighbor @xmath26 , the player",

    "this normalization avoids an additional bias from the different degree of nodes . in the next section , we perform the simulations of the pdg and sg respectively and our goal is to find how the preferential learning affect the evolutionary cooperative behaviors of both pdg and sg .",

    "the strategies of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are uniformly distributed among all the players .",

    "one can also find that the larger the value of @xmath18 , the larger the value of @xmath24 corresponding to the maximal @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , an interesting phenomenon is observed in fig .",
    "2 , that is when @xmath18 is small , positive @xmath24 leads to better cooperative behavior than the negative one ; however , for large @xmath18 , the system performs better when choosing negative @xmath24 .",
    "these results imply that if the income of defectors is only little more than that of cooperators , the leader s effect will considerably enhances the cooperation ; while if the selfish behavior is encouraged in the system ( large @xmath18 ) , the influential individuals will leads to the imitation of selfish behavior and reduce the cooperator density in a certain extent . on the contrary ,",

    "contrary to the pdg , for very large @xmath42 , the system still performs cooperative behavior , which is attributed to the fact that the rule of sg favors the cooperators , that is the cooperators yet gain payoff @xmath19 when meeting defectors . combining the above simulation results of both the pdg and sg",
