    "with the advent of large scale neutral beam heating , magnetically confined fusion plasmas have drifted from the simple picture of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , which describes the plasma as a single , stationary , isotropic maxwellian fluid .",
    "due principally to neutral beam heating , several tokamak experiments now boast plasma toroidal rotation speeds that approach the thermal mach speed and have significant stored energy residing in the energetic particle population produced by charge exchange with thermals .",
    "motivated by these developments , a range of new descriptions have emerged that include thermal rotation @xcite as well as energetic particles @xcite . despite this , ideal mhd is still the foundation of nearly all analysis .",
    "detailed magnetic reconstruction based on this treatment ignores the energetic complexity of the plasma , and can result in model - data inconsistencies , such as thermal pressure profiles which are inconsistent with the total stored kinetic energy of the plasma .",
    "a parallel development has been the improvement in the diversity , accuracy and resolution of plasma diagnostics .",
    "interpretation , however , often requires a detailed knowledge of the plasma equilibrium .",
    "for example , inference of the toroidal current profile @xmath0 from line of sight measurements of the polarization angle requires a knowledge of the poloidal flux @xmath1 across the plasma .",
    "formally , diagnostic forward functions relate the vector of plasma parameters @xmath2 to the measurement vector @xmath3 . for a linear system , such as toroidal current inference in a double null configuration , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are normally related through a response matrix @xmath4 with additional contributions @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 .",
    "inference involves inverting this relationship to give plasma parameters @xmath2 that are consistent with the data @xmath3 .",
    "a widespread technique used is least - square fitting , in which prior assumptions are included via a penalty term in the fit .",
    "the confluence of higher performance plasmas with diagnostic development has however led to a dichotomy : data is often inconsistent with ideal mhd equilibria , sometimes misleading scientists to propose new phenomena to describe data `` artifacts '' .",
    "an example is filamentation of flux surfaces in the rijhnuizen tokamak , which was inferred from fluctuations in measurements of electron temperature @xcite .",
    "subsequent analysis of the thomson scattering detection chain revealed that with the correct photoelectron statistics and 2d instrument profile , similar structures could arise from noise . @xcite .",
    "recently , a new integrated data - modelling approach for inference of fusion plasma parameters has emerged which offers a natural framework with which to resolve artifacts from model behaviour . in contrast to least square fitting , the bayesian approach to inference involves the specification of an initial prior probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath7 , which is then updated by taking into account information that the measurements provide through the likelihood pdf @xmath8 .",
    "the result is the posterior distribution @xmath9 given by bayes formula @xmath10 the advantage of the bayesian approach over traditional inversion techniques is two - fold : ( i ) prior knowledge , including known parameter inter - dependencies is made explicit , and ( ii ) as the formulation is probabilistic , random errors , systematic uncertainties and instrumental bias are integral part of the analysis rather than an afterthought .    in this work we present initial results of forward models of current tomography in the mega ampere spherical tokamak ( mast ) , we formulate bayesian inference of force balance , and we identify plans for inference of mode structure in the h1 heliac .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : mast_tomography ] briefly outlines the mast experiment and present first results for bayesian inference of poloidal flux and current profiles from mast motional stark effect ( mse ) measurements .",
    "section [ sec : force_balance ] outlines a bayesian inference framework for force balance , synthesizes a pressure profile posterior given the flux surfaces from mse and thomson scattering data , and computes an estimate of @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the toroidal flux function . using this , we are able to quantify the impact of poloidal currents on the equilibrium configuration .",

    "sec : conclusions ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "the mega ampere spherical tokamak , which first published physics results in 2001 @xcite , is one of the world s largest spherical tokamaks .",
    "while mast physics and technology development have contributed across a broad range of fusion science @xcite , two properties of mast help motivate this research : high performance , and precision diagnostics .",
    "it is the combination of these properties in a spherical tokamak , which has a relatively weak toroidal field and therefore large sensitivity to poloidal currents compared to conventional tokamaks , which helps motivate selection of mast to develop bayesian inference for force balance .",
    "recently , both mast neutral beam injectors have been upgraded to 3.8  mw .",
    "this has enabled plasma performance to be routinely lifted above @xmath13 , which was reported in 2005 @xcite .",
    "mast is equipped with an array of precision diagnostics @xcite , including a high spatial resolution , single - time point , ruby thomson scattering system , a multi - time point nd : yag thomson scattering system with a coarser spatial resolution , motional stark effect , charge exchange recombination , and fast magnetics @xcite .",
    "our development of bayesian inference of the current profile on mast closely follows the seminal work of svensson and werner @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the plasma was represented as a grid of toroidal axisymmetric current beams , each with rectangular cross - section and each beam carrying a uniform current density . in mast",
    ", we have placed these beams so as to fill - out the entire limiter region as depicted in figure [ fig : plasma_beam ] .",
    "the magnetic field generated is a summation of biot - savart s law over current beams .",
    "a key advantage to using a series of current beams with finite cross - section to model the plasma current ( as opposed to a filamentary model ) is that the semi - analytic expressions for the corresponding magnetic field and vector potential have no singularities , even at points within the current beam itself . indeed ,",
    "if one were to use filaments to model the plasma current , there would be many singular points in the calculated magnetic field within the plasma that would make subsequent flux - surface calculations difficult and somewhat questionable @xcite .    : plasma beam cross - sections fill out the mast limiter region in the plasma beam current model .",

    "the importance of this will become clear in the next two paragraphs .",
    "the main diagnostics used to infer the current distribution are pickup coils @xmath35 , full flux loops @xmath36 and the polarisation angle @xmath37 of the emitted light from neutrally excited species during neutral beam injection due to the motional stark effect ( mse ) .",
    "the responses of these diagnostics to a current running through a beam , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angle between a pickup coil s normal and the outboard midplane , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants for the particular mse viewing geometry .",

    "( by convention , the notation `` @xmath44 '' is reserved for probability theory . )",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 have a linear dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and hence they are linearly dependent on the total current going through each beam of the current plasma beam model .",

    "used a conditional auto - regressive ( car ) prior to perform bayesian inference for the current beam model of the plasma , and this is the model adopted in this paper .",
    "the advantage of this choice in prior is that plasma beam currents are correlated to each other but in a spatially localised way .",
    "thus , this prior has the effect of enforcing some smoothness between adjacent current beams , while minimising spatially long ranged effects due to manipulating the current in a particular beam .",

    "while the @xmath109 profile is similar to efit , the change in @xmath12 from the core to the edge is 22% , which is slightly larger than the efit value .",
    "qualitatively , this poloidal current should lift the on - axis safety factor by @xmath130% , and increase the change in poloidal flux across the plasma , but not change the geometry of flux surfaces or the shafranov shift . at present",
    ", we are substituting the corrected @xmath34 profile inferred from @xmath12 into minerva to compute the effect of poloidal currents on the calculation of @xmath20 and @xmath1 surfaces .",
    "this constitutes a first step towards combining @xmath197 and @xmath109 to validate different equilibrium descriptions .",
    "finally , we have developed an analysis approach for the inference of mode structures , and constructed a gae model .",
    "the model , which is in cylindrical geometry , accounts for a non constant density profile , features helical ripple averaging to compute the suydam criterion and generate @xmath131 , and includes the vacuum region .",
    "the model has been applied to the range of @xmath131 profiles accessible to h-1 plasmas , and the minimum in the continuum computed as a function of helical winding current ratio @xmath159 .",
    "the eigenfunction of a candidate @xmath192 gae mode was determined at an angular frequency of 12.1  krad s@xmath196 .",
    "the eigenfunction has similar structure to recent observations in h1 , including the same number of radial nodes which occur at similar radial positions .    in ongoing work",
    "we are developing forward models of thomson scattering and charge exchange recombination spectroscopy for inference of force balance in mast plasmas . we will be exploiting this information not only to improve equilibrium reconstruction , but to use bayesian inference as a tool with which to resolve competing equilibrium models .",
    "in particular , we intend to compare force balance descriptions of ideal mhd , ideal mhd with flow @xcite , two fluid models @xcite , and energetic fluid resolved equilibria @xcite . the bayesian model offers a rigorous framework with which to quantify the fit and thereby elucidate the important underlying physics . with regards mode structure , we intend to transform the cylindrical eigenfunction to a beam cross - section equilibria @xcite and identify a candidate mode set which spans the different type of mode structures observed .",
    "the next stage of this work involves deployment of forward models for mode structures into minerva to compute the posterior for the mode class and parameters . on a longer time scale",
    "we envisage the cylindrical plasma model will be replaced by a fully 3d ideal mhd wave mode code , cas3d @xcite . as with equilibrium modelling , the importance of mode analysis by bayesian inversion is that it offers a rigorous framework in which to identify wave mode structures , some of which have deleterious effects on plasma performance .",
