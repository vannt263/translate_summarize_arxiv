    "however , the intensity of the maximum usually grows with temperature and with departure from half - filling .",
    "this indicates that the maximum is more likely due to a bound electron - hole state in which both components belong to the same hubbard subband , while in the high - frequency maxima the components belong to different subbands .",

    "the calculated square of the site spin differs by less than 10 percent from the data of monte carlo simulations .",
