    "the standard formulation of lattice qcd by wilson has been used since the early days of lattice gauge theory . however , it is known that in this formulation the leading discretization errors are linear in the lattice spacing @xmath1 . moreover , by testing the pcac relation on the lattice , it could be demonstrated that the effects of these discretization errors are most severe and can influence values of physical observables strongly @xcite .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that , by implementing symanzik s improvement programme @xcite for qcd on - shell and non - perturbatively , one can reach a complete cancellation of the @xmath2 effects .",
    "the advantages of this procedure are obvious , and this conference has seen the improvement programme successfully at work @xcite .",
    "the complete improvement programme demands as a first step a computation of the parameter @xmath0 that multiplies the sheikholeslami - wohlert term @xcite in the improved action .",
    "in addition , also the coefficients that enter the improved operators have to be determined . by now , in the quenched approximation , a number of these parameters are known as a function of the bare gauge coupling @xmath3 @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we want to initiate the computation of the improvement coefficients for two flavours of dynamical fermions . as a first step we will compute the coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known , dynamical fermion simulations are very demanding even with today s computers and algorithms @xcite . on the other hand , knowing the improvement coefficients will substantially reduce the computational cost , since one is allowed to choose larger lattice spacings .",
    "the idea of testing the lattice artefacts is to probe the pcac relation , which should hold , up to @xmath2 corrections : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the isovector axial current and @xmath6 the corresponding density .",
    "the quark mass that appears in eq .",
    "( [ pcac ] ) is a bare current quark mass at scale @xmath7 .",
    "the important point to notice here is that the pcac relation is an operator identity that can be inserted into arbitrary correlation functions .",
    "one can make use of this fact to improve the theory : one tests the pcac relation in different correlation functions and demands to obtain always the same value of @xmath8 . using the schrdinger functional ,",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite how this strategy can be efficiently implemented to determine @xmath0 . here",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite closely and impose exactly the same improvement condition : @xmath9 at @xmath10 , with @xmath11 as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the improvement condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) can in principle be imposed at any ( not too large ) value of @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is a specific definition of the current quark mass @xcite derived from eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in order to guarantee a smooth behaviour of",
    "@xmath13 one should , however , make a definite choice , where a natural value is @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath11 turns out to be a very weak function of the quark mass @xmath12 @xcite , one may also compute @xmath11 for @xmath15 . in particular",
    ", for the values of @xmath16 chosen , here , the error introduced is negligible compared with the statistical one .",
    "the numerical simulations are performed on @xmath17 lattices , with boundary conditions as detailed in @xcite .",
    "we use the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm with the sexton - weingarten scheme to integrate the classical equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "our implementation of the hmc algorithm is described in detail in ref .",
    "all simulations are performed on the massively parallel alenia quadrics ( ape ) computers .",
    "on the two versions of these machines that we have used with 256 and 512 nodes , we ran 32 and 64 independent simulations in parallel .",
    "combined with a jack - knife method , this allows for a realistic error estimate on our observables .",
    "we have run simulations at eight values of @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 .",
    "each simulation has at least @xmath20 molecular dynamics trajectories and typically @xmath21 . keeping the trajectory length fixed to 1 , we reach typical acceptance rates of @xmath22 . despite the relatively large acceptance rates",
    ", we noticed that sometimes a system can get stuck and does not accept a number of ( larger than , say , @xmath23 ) trajectories . the problem is easily overcome by performing every @xmath24 number of trajectories one with a much smaller step size",
    "of course , in order to be able to show that one generates the correct distribution , the value of @xmath24 has to be chosen independently of the monte carlo history .",
    "we simply kept @xmath24 fixed in each simulation .",
    "we applied the improvement condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) in the small quark mass region , @xmath25 .. ] with schrdinger functional boundary conditions , simulations at such small quark masses are unproblematic , since the massless dirac operator of the schrdinger functional with time extent @xmath26 has a lowest eigenvalue with magnitude @xmath27 .",
    "owing to the @xmath28 terms in @xmath29 , the simulations slow down , when @xmath30 is decreased . in detail",
    "the reason for this is threefold .",
    "first , going to smaller values of @xmath30 we have to decrease the step size @xmath31 from , as an example , @xmath32 at @xmath33 to @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "second , the condition number @xmath36 of the preconditioned fermion matrix @xmath37 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a definition of @xmath38 ) increases with decreasing @xmath30 , as can be seen in fig .  1 .    [ figure1 ]    = 12.8 cm = 12.8 cm    the increasing values of @xmath36 result in a growing number of conjugate gradient ( cg ) iterations when going to smaller @xmath30 .",
    "third , we find an increase of the autocorrelation time @xmath39 with decreasing @xmath30 for observables such as the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath37 or quark correlation functions at a given distance .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the autocorrelation time for @xmath11 is small , @xmath40@xmath41 , and shows only a weak dependence on @xmath30 .    as a rule",
    ", we find that the performance of the simulation algorithm does not significantly depend on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the only exception are the autocorrelation times @xmath39 for which there are indications that they are particularly large when both @xmath0 and @xmath30 are small .",
    "we determined @xmath11 at fixed @xmath30 for various values of @xmath0 . from the linear dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath0",
    "we can then extract the slope @xmath42 .",
    "we found in practice that the slope is well described by a linear function of @xmath43 . in order to extract the desired improvement coefficients @xmath44 at the eight values of @xmath45 , where the simulations are performed",
    ", we fit all our data for @xmath46 to the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 as well as @xmath44 are fit parameters .",
    "the results for @xmath50 are displayed as the full symbols in fig .",
    "the solid line is a representation of these data , given by @xmath51        as already mentioned , for small values of @xmath30 the simulations become very costly , and we were not able to perform simulations at @xmath52 and small quark masses .",
    "we therefore switched to the following strategy : we take the parameterization eq .",
    "( [ pade ] ) to extrapolate a little bit further in @xmath30 , to @xmath52 . at the value of @xmath0 determined in this way",
    ", we then select a large quark mass , @xmath53 and try to verify that improvement is at work .",
    "indeed , we find for @xmath52 and @xmath54 that @xmath55 .",
    "this indicates that our final result eq .",
    "( [ pade ] ) can safely be used for @xmath56 .",
    "preliminary studies of the hadron spectrum in the improved theory suggest that @xmath56 yields the range of lattice spacings that is of interest to computations of hadronic properties @xcite ."
