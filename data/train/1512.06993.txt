    "new discoveries related to the magnetic field of a neutron star have led to the theoretical researches on the magnetic properties of the dense matter .",
    "the magnetic field of a neutron star may originate from the compression of magnetic flux inherited from the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "using this idea , woltjer has predicted a magnetic field strength of order @xmath2 for neutron stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , general relativity predicts the allowed maximum value of neutron star magnetic field to be about @xmath3 @xcite . by comparing with the observational data , yuan et al . obtained a magnetic field strength of order @xmath4 for neutron stars @xcite . in the core of inhomogeneous gravitationally bound dense magnetars",
    ", the magnetic field strength can be as large as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , considering the formation of a quark core in the interior of a magnetar , the maximum field reaches up to about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these very intense magnetic fields have significant effects on the dense nuclear matter .",
    "some studies have investigated the properties of neutron star matter and nuclear matter @xcite in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the instabilities of nuclear matter was studied considering the relativistic nuclear models @xcite .",
    "they found that the presence of the magnetic field will generally increase the instability region .",
    "the effects of strong magnetic fields on nuclear matter were studied in the framework of the relativistic mean field models fsu - gold by including the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "they concluded that at low densities , by increasing the magnetic field , the energy per particle turns out to be increasing lower and a softening of the equation of state appears .",
    "however , they showed that at high densities , while the softening of the eos will be gradually overwhelmed by stiffening resulting from the anomalous magnetic moments effect , the energies are slightly reduced by a strong magnetic field .",
    "employing two relativistic field - theoretical models for nuclear matter , the walecka model and an extended linear sigma model , it has been found that the creation of nuclear matter in a sufficiently strong magnetic field becomes energetically more costly due to the heaviness of magnetized nucleons @xcite . using the semi - empirical mass formula of green based on the liquid drop nuclear model ,",
    "the onset of the neutron drip in high - density matter in the presence of a magnetic field has been investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been found that for systems having only protons and electrons , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath6 , neutronization occurs at a density that is at least an order of magnitude higher compared to that in a nonmagnetic system .",
    "the effect of a strong magnetic field on the proton spin polarization and magnetic susceptibility of asymmetric nuclear matter has been studied within a relativistic mean - field approach @xcite .    in our previous works , we have studied the spin polarized neutron matter @xcite , symmetric nuclear matter @xcite , asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite , and neutron star matter @xcite at zero temperature using the lowest order constraint variational ( locv ) method with the realistic strong interaction in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "we have also investigated the thermodynamic properties of these systems at finite temperature with no magnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the properties of spin polarized neutron matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields at zero @xcite and finite @xcite temperatures .",
    "very recently , we have investigated the temperature and density dependence of asymmetry energy of nuclear matter @xcite . in the present work ,",

    "this shows that for the nuclear matter , the spontaneous phase transition to a ferromagnetic state does not occur @xcite . obviously , for @xmath1 , the spin polarization symmetry is broken and the energy has a minimum value at a positive spin polarization parameter .",

    "as we mentioned above , in the free field case , the spin polarization parameter is equal to zero , showing that no spontaneous phase transition to a ferromagnetic state occurs . for the magnetic fields @xmath62",

    "we found that at each density , by increasing the magnetic field up to @xmath69 , the nuclear spin polarization parameter is nearly constant .",
    "however , for the magnetic fields @xmath70 , this parameter grows by increasing the magnetic field . evidently , as the density increases , the stronger magnetic fields are needed to affect the spin polarization parameter , consistent with the results obtained in ref .",
    ". the increasing rate of the spin polarization parameter versus the magnetic field depends on the nucleon density . at lower densities , this parameter is more sensitive to the magnetic field and grows more rapidly .",
    "obviously , at each density , the increasing rate of the spin polarization parameter becomes significant at a particular value of the magnetic field .",
    "for example at @xmath71 , the increasing rate of @xmath10 raises at @xmath72 .",
    "this value of the magnetic field increases by increasing the density .",
    "the energy for nuclear matter as a function of the density at different magnetic fields is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4j ] .",
    "we can see that for @xmath73 , at each density , the energy of the system increases as the magnetic field grows . evidently , the effect of strong magnetic fields is more considerable at lower densities .",

    "we can see that at high magnetic fields , the nuclear matter energy increases as the magnetic field grows . the magnetic field necessary to affect the nuclear matter energy depends on the nucleon density .",
    "the higher the density becomes , the stronger the magnetic field necessary is .",
    "in fact , the magnetic effects on the nuclear matter are significant at low densities and high magnetic fields .",
    "thus , to affect the high density nuclear matter , very strong magnetic field is needed .",
    "[ fig:5j ] also implies that for high magnetic fields , the increase in the nuclear matter energy is more important at lower densities .",
    "using locv method and the @xmath0 two - body potential , we have considered the effects of strong magnetic fields on the properties of nuclear matter .",
    "it has been shown that for the nuclear matter , the spontaneous phase transition to a ferromagnetic state does not occur , while the spin polarization symmetry of energy is broken at high magnetic fields .",
