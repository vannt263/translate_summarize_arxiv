    "the proposal of doping c@xmath0 crystals in a field - effect device ( fet ) and the possibility of metallic conduction and even superconductivity in such devices had raised wide - spread interest . while the revelation of dishonest data handling in some cases@xcite led to a severe damping of the initial enthusiasm , fundamental aspects of field effect doping remains a timely and interesting problem . for field - effect transistors made with self - assembled monolayers",
    "this question was addressed in ref .   and",
    "for the reported enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in c@xmath0 crystals intercalated with haloform molecules in refs .  .",
    "attempts to observe the field - effect in graphite were reported in ref .  .",
    "here we address , from a theoretical point of view , the question how strongly c@xmath0 can be doped in an electric field before its electronic structure is substantially changed and how this structure changes in even stronger fields .",
    "this is relevant for understanding the fundamental features of field - effect devices based on c@xmath0 and involves a number of interesting physical problems .",
    "it appears that doping c@xmath0 crystals in a field - effect device ( fet ) is very hard to achieve in practice , one of the reasons being the exceptionally strong fields that are required .",
    "very strong fields , however , not only induce charge carriers , but also polarize the molecules , and , due to the stark effect , in general , lift degeneracies .",
    "these effects are of particular importance , as c@xmath0 is quite polarizable , and as its molecular levels are highly degenerate .",
    "the term `` field - doping '' naively implies that these effects are small , such that the main effect of the external field is inducing charge carriers into electronic levels which are essentially unaffected by the field .",
    "it is clear that if the external field is strong enough , the electronic structure of the crystal will be strongly modified by the field , and one thus can no longer speak of doping . a fundamental question about field - effect devices is therefore connected with the doping levels achievable , before the electronic structure of the active material is substantially altered .",
    "moreover we discuss in detail how the electronic structure is changed , when the external field is beyond this `` doping limit '' . in this regime the commonly used analogy of the field - doped c@xmath0 with the alkali - doped fullerenes no longer holds .",
    "nevertheless a field - effect device with high carrier concentration would be an interesting device in its own right .",
    "one might , e.g. , speculate that for c@xmath0 in a strong electric field the electron - phonon coupling is enhanced compared to unperturbed c@xmath0 , as for molecular orbitals of lower symmetry less couplings are forbidden by symmetry .",
    "for a first estimate of the fields involved in field - doping , consider a simple capacitor .",
    "given a charge per area @xmath1 on the plates , the electric field _",
    "between _ the plates is @xmath2 . assuming that in field - doped c@xmath0 the induced charge resides in the top - most layer,@xcite inducing @xmath3 elementary charges per molecules requires an _ external _ field ( originating from the gate electrode ) of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the area per molecule in the top - most layer of the crystal . for a c@xmath0 crystal with",
    "lattice constant @xmath6  14    typical areas per molecule are @xmath7 for the ( 111)-plane and @xmath8 for the ( 001)-plane . even though these areas are quite large , the external fields necessary for field doping are substantial , being of the order of 1 v /   per induced elementary charge per molecule .",
    "this is , however , not the field experienced by a molecule .",
    "as c@xmath0 is highly polarizable ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) , in the solid , the external field at the site of a molecule is screened by the polarization of the neighboring molecules : a monolayer of dipoles @xmath11 centered on the lattice sites @xmath12 , generates a field @xmath13 at @xmath14 , where the sum is over all sites in the monolayer , except @xmath14 . for the ( 111 ) layer , this sum is about @xmath15 , for the less dense ( 001 ) layer it is about @xmath16 . as the dipole moments @xmath11 of the molecules are induced by the screened field @xmath17 at the site of the molecule ( @xmath18 ) , we find , by self - consistent solution , that the external field is reduced by about a factor of two .",
    "inducing charge and polarizing the molecules is , however , not the only effect of the external field .",
    "in addition it also leads to a splitting of the molecular levels  the stark effect .",
    "as the molecular orbitals of c@xmath0 have a definite parity , a homogeneous field splits the levels only in second order .",
    "thus for low fields the splitting is quite small , but increases quickly for larger fields .",
    "we can expect that the splitting of the molecular levels disrupts the electronic structure of the crystal only when it becomes of the order of the band width , which is about @xmath19 ev in c@xmath0 .",
    "calculations indicate that the splittings of the @xmath20- and @xmath21-levels in a _ homogeneous _ field are surprisingly small , being less than @xmath19 ev up to @xmath22 v /   ( cf",
    ".  figure  [ splitting ] ) . given the crudeness of the argument",
    ", it thus seems entirely feasible that doping of a few elementary charges per molecule could be achieved before the electronic structure of the c@xmath0 is substantially changed .    in the argument above we have described the c@xmath0 molecules as polarizable points .",
    "it is then natural to refine the model by considering also higher multipoles .",
    "such a multipole expansion is particularly suitable for c@xmath0 as the molecules are nearly spherical .",
    "the approach is then the following : first we calculate the response of a c@xmath0 molecule to external multipole fields .",
    "then we self - consistently solve the electrostatic problem for a lattice of molecules in a homogeneous external field .",
    "this provides us with the multipole expansion of the screened field acting on each molecule in the solid .",
    "given that screened field , we can then determine the splitting of the molecular levels as a function of the induced charge .",
    "the organization of the paper reflects this approach : in section [ sec : dft ] we describe the density functional calculations for determining the multipole response and the stark splitting for a c@xmath0 molecule in a multipole field for several symmetrical configuration .",
    "using group theory , in section [ sec : irresp ] , the irreducible parameters for the multipole response are determined .",
    "this allows the calculation of the polarization for arbitrary configurations . in section [ sec : split ]",
    "we give an analogous treatment for the stark splittings and explicitly show how the splitting changes as the molecule is rotated relative to the external field . in section [ sec : mol_in_layer ] we use these ingredients to self - consistently solve for the screened field seen by a molecule in a charged monolayer .",
    "the splitting of the molecular levels in this self - consistent multipole field and the effect of this splitting on the density of states is presented in section [ sec : scsplit ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the methods for calculating the response and splitting for an arbitrarily oriented external field from the results of the density functional calculations that were performed only for special orientations are described in the appendices .",
    "appendix [ sec : rsh ] gives an example of how to calculate the response of a molecule using the irreducible parameters derived in section [ sec : irresp ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : coupling ] we derive the coupling matrices needed for the calculating the level splitting when the molecule is rotated in the external field .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec : shtranslation ] gives the derivation of the matrix describing the field generated by a lattice of identical multipoles at the origin , which is needed for finding the self - consistent electrostatic field .",
    "to determine the response of a c@xmath0 molecule to external multipole fields we have performed all - electron density functional calculations using gaussian - orbitals.@xcite the basis set comprises 5s4p3d for carbon@xcite and we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional.@xcite    in our calculations we apply an external multipole field and study the change in the multipole moments of the charge density and the splitting of the molecular levels as a function of the strength of the external field . to take advantage of the molecule s symmetry we consider multipole fields with the @xmath23-axis along the",
    "2- , 3- , and 5-fold axis of the molecule ( cf .",
    "figure  [ orient ] ) . as these axes are each contained in a mirror plane , which we chose to be the @xmath24-@xmath23-plane",
    ", we can treat the thus oriented molecule as having symmetry group @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "applying external multipole fields with @xmath28 , this symmetry is maintained if the fields are proportional to the real part of the spherical harmonic @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an integer multiple of the order ( @xmath312 , 3 , or 5 ) of the symmetry axis .",
    "likewise , the response of the charge density will only have multipole components proportional to @xmath32 , with @xmath30 an integer multiple of @xmath3 .",
    "calculations were done for such symmetry conserving multipole fields up to @xmath33 . for the 3-fold axis oriented along @xmath23",
    ", we have , in addition , calculated the response to external fields proportional to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , i.e. , with a symmetry lowered to @xmath37 . as we are interested in the linear response , we have considered small multipole fields and made sure that the calculated response of the charge density is indeed proportional to the strength of the external field .",
    "we find that the linear response of a c@xmath0 molecule is very similar to that of a metallic sphere of radius 4.4  .",
    "this effective sphere radius shows a slight increase with @xmath38 .",
    "in addition there are weak off - diagonal terms .",
    "to judge the accuracy of our calculation , we have checked how well the selection rules , that are not already imposed by the @xmath39 symmetry , are fulfilled for these off - diagonal terms . from the calculated response , we have determined the irreducible linear response coefficients , which will be given in the next section .",
    "in addition to polarizing the molecule , the external field also splits the degenerate molecular levels of the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "as the unperturbed molecular orbitals have a definite parity , for a multipole field with odd @xmath38 there will be no first - order splitting  the quadratic stark effect .",
    "on the other hand , a multipole field with even @xmath38 can couple states of like parity , so in that case the splitting is linear .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ splitting ] . in section [ sec :",
    "split ] it will be demonstrated how the splitting of the homo- and lumo - orbitals that were calculated for high - symmetry geometries can be extended by group theory to arbitrary orientations of the molecule relative to the external multipole field .",
    "all calculations have been performed for the equilibrium geometry of the unperturbed , neutral c@xmath0 molecule . to estimate the effect of an external field on the shape of the molecule , we have relaxed the structure in the presence of homogeneous external fields of up to 1 v /  .",
    "we find only small changes ( up to about 0.005  ) in the lengths of the bonds ( 1.40   for the short and 1.45   for the long bonds ) . likewise ,",
    "the polarizability changes by less than 1.5% .",
    "finally , we have calculated the total energy of the isolated c@xmath0 ion as a function of its charge @xmath40 ( spin unpolarized calculation with relaxed geometries ) and extracted the second order term @xmath41 . to compare with previous calculations,@xcite we find for the polarizability ( multipole field with @xmath42 ) of the neutral molecule @xmath439.3 @xmath10/atom , and @xmath443.2 ev .",
    "the polarizability @xmath45 of a molecule describes the linear dependence of the induced dipole moment @xmath46 on the applied electric field @xmath47 . for a multipole expansion",
    ", @xmath45 becomes a matrix @xmath48 describing the response to all multipole fields.@xcite to fix the notation ( which follows ref .  )",
    "we briefly review the definition of the multipole response matrix .",
    "the solutions of the laplace equation @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 where the two terms denote the external potential ( @xmath51 ) , and the induced potential ( @xmath52 ) due to a charge distribution @xmath53 located around @xmath54 .",
    "note that both , the laplace equation as well as the expansion of @xmath55 into multipoles only holds for @xmath56 which lie outside the charge distribution .",
    "we have introduced the regular and irregular spherical harmonics,@xcite @xmath57 special cases for the regular spherical harmonics are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , hence , the external field , @xmath60 corresponds to a constant shift , and @xmath61 is the @xmath23-component of the electric field .",
    "for the irregular spherical harmonics we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 , thus for the induced potential , @xmath64 gives the monopole charge while @xmath65 is the dipole moment .",
    "generally , the coefficients @xmath66 are the multipole moments of the charge distribution @xmath53 @xmath67 decomposing the charge distribution @xmath68 into the unperturbed charge density and the change in the charge density due to the external potential , we obtain a decomposition of the multipole moments @xmath69 .",
    "within linear response , the coefficients @xmath70 of the induced multipole moments depend linearly on the coefficients @xmath71 of the external potential , which defines the linear - response matrix @xmath48 : @xmath72 where the sign takes into account that the induced fields oppose the external fields",
    ". then @xmath73 gives the dipolar response tensor , while @xmath74 is the self - capacitance @xmath75 .",
    "the interaction energy of the molecule with the external potential is @xmath76 , which , using the previous definitions , reduces to @xmath77 therefore , @xmath78 and @xmath66 are pairs of conjugate variables and the _ total _ energy of the molecule as a function of the external field is given by @xmath79 since this is a quadratic form , we see that the matrix @xmath45 is hermitian .",
    "we can make @xmath45 real and symmetric by unitarily transforming to a real basis ( using @xmath80 and @xmath81 instead of @xmath29 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "the structure of the response matrix @xmath45 depends on the symmetry of the molecule . for a metallic sphere of radius @xmath84",
    "the response is isotropic , i.e. , @xmath45 is diagonal in the basis of the spherical harmonics : @xmath85 .",
    "lowering the symmetry to icosahedral , @xmath86 , introduces some anisotropy .",
    "to understand the response matrix for c@xmath0 we have to consider how the irreducible representations ( ir ) of the rotation group @xmath87 split into irs of the @xmath86 ( see table  [ tab : ldecompi ] ) .",
    "an external multipole field of angular momentum @xmath38 can only give rise to a response with angular momentum @xmath88 , if both irs of the @xmath87 contain a common ir of the @xmath86 .",
    "in particular , because of parity , fields with even ( odd ) @xmath38 can only give rise to responses with even ( odd ) @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , as the irreducible representations with @xmath89 are also irreducible with respect to the @xmath86 , for @xmath89 we have @xmath90 .",
    "thus , restricting the multipole expansion to @xmath89 , the response of c@xmath0 is isotropic , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath94 the space spanned by the spherical harmonics @xmath29 is no longer irreducible with respect to the @xmath86 . thus we need to find linear combinations of the spherical harmonics that span the irreducible representations of the icosahedral group .",
    "we call them @xmath95 where @xmath38 and @xmath24 denote the ir of the @xmath87 and @xmath86 , respectively , while the index @xmath96 labels the functions within an irreducible representation of the @xmath86 .",
    "if in the decomposition an ir @xmath24 should occur several times , we would have to introduce an additional multiplicity label .",
    "however , as can be seen from table  [ tab : ldecompi ] , up to @xmath33 each ir appears at most once .",
    "we therefore suppress the multiplicity label here .",
    "explicit expressions for the basis functions @xmath95 , can , e.g. , be found in ref .   ,",
    "chapter 16 , or ref .  , table  4.2 .    in the new basis ,",
    "the matrix @xmath45 is built of blocks of diagonal matrices @xmath97 where @xmath98 constitute the minimal set of parameters , and , @xmath45 being real symmetric , @xmath99 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath45 were calculated up to @xmath33 using the results of the density functional calculations described in section  [ sec : dft ] . the @xmath98",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : lr ] . from this minimal set of independent parameters we can determine the response for arbitrary orientations of the c@xmath0 molecule relative to the external multipole field .",
    "an example of how to do this is given in appendix  [ sec : rsh ] .",
    "the practical advantage of this procedure is clear : we only need to perform density functional calculations for a number of highly symmetric configurations , for which the numerical effort is much reduced .",
    "using group theory the response for arbitrary configurations can then be determined from these special cases .",
    "note that the group theoretical approach presented in this section is particularly elegant in the case of a neutral molecule which has icosahedral symmetry . upon charging ,",
    "orbitals become partially filled and the symmetry is reduced which leads to a higher number of irreducible response coefficients . furthermore",
    ", the symmetry of a charged molecule depends on how the additional charge arranges in the degenerate orbitals .",

    "<S> we investigate the possibility of doping c@xmath0 crystals by applying a strong electric field . for an accurate description of a c@xmath0 field - effect device </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a multipole expansion of the field , the response of the c@xmath0 molecules , and the stark splitting of the molecular levels . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant response coefficients and splittings are calculated _ ab initio _ for several high symmetry orientations . </S>",
    "<S> using a group theoretic analysis we extend these results to arbitrary orientations of the c@xmath0 molecules with respect to the external field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , surprisingly , for the highest occupied ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , respectively , the two leading multipole components lift the degeneracy of the molecular level in the same way . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the relative signs of the splittings turn out to be such that the splittings add up when the external field induces charge into the respective level . </S>",
    "<S> that means that when charge carriers are put into a level , its electronic structure is strongly modified . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in general , in c@xmath0 field - effect devices charge is not simply put into otherwise unchanged bands , so already because of this their physics should be quite different from that of the alkali - doped fullerenes . </S>"
