    "in recent work @xcite the wave function and the dynamics of a model universe with variable space dimension have been studied in detail . in this model ,",
    "the space dimension decreases during the expansion of the universe .",
    "there is a dimensional constraint that relates the space dimension to the size of the universe .",
    "time variation of the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath1 , is studied in our model universe @xcite .",
    "this study shows an upper limit for the space dimension at the planck length . in @xcite",
    "we apply the dimensional constraint of the model to the simplest chaotic inflation and investigate the dynamical behavior of the inflaton field , the scale factor , the space dimension , and also their interdependence during the inflationary epoch .",
    "our motivation for studying chaotic inflation with variable space dimensions is that it enables us to calculate some cosmological quantities and compare them with recent observational data , including the spectral indices .",
    "these comparisons indicate to what degree our model universe with variable space dimensions is consistent with the latest observational data .",
    "our main results are : _",
    "i ) _ an upper limit for the space dimension at the planck length , _ ii ) _ a small shift in the value of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to larger values , producing delayed chaotic inflation , and _",
    "iii ) _ derivation of the spectral indices and other observable quantities .",
    "as we show in @xcite , in this model the number of space dimensions at the planck length must be less than @xmath4 , which is in agreement with the previous result in @xcite .",
    "after this work was substantially complete we learned the picture of delayed recombination at redshift @xmath5 caused by early sources of ly @xmath6 radiation @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that this delayed recombination may be related to our results of delayed chaotic inflation .",
    "but it is good science to bear in mind the possibility that nature is more complicated than our ideas , a rule that has particular force in cosmology because of the limited empirical basis .",
    "future analyses of boomerang data contains estimates of cosmological parameters and informations about the contents and history of the universe @xcite .",
    "if boomerang data does not agree with delayed chaotic inflation , it would convincingly rule out our model for delayed inflation .",
    "work on this issue is in progress .",
    "mansouri and nasseri have studied the model universe with variable space dimension in detail @xcite .",
    "there is a constraint in this model which can be written as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the scale factor of friedmann universe , @xmath9 variable space dimension , and @xmath10 a constant of the model .",
    "the zero subscript in any quantity e.g. in @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes its present value . choosing the value of the space dimension at the planck epoch @xmath13 we can obtain the value of @xmath10 by eq .",

    "the dynamical behavior of the universe in this model was obtained by using hawking - ellis action of a prefect fluid @xcite .",
    "let us now study the inflationary cosmology when the space dimension is a dynamical parameter . to do this ,",
    "we first write down our formulation for general potential , and then use our results in @xmath0 potential .",
    "the crucial equations are obtained by using chaotic inflation scenario into our variable space dimension model . using slow - roll approximation",
    ", we obtain the dynamical equation for the space dimension @xcite @xmath14 to study the chaotic inflation with variable space dimension , we calculate the number of e - foldings @xmath15 .",
    "we find the value of @xmath15 by numerical calculations .",
    "the initial size of the universe @xmath16 at the beginning of inflation is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the scale factor at the end of inflation .",
    "using dynamical equations , we obtain the value of the inflaton field at the beginning @xmath19 and at the end of inflation @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1 and 2 show @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "to obtain the number of e - foldings @xmath15 , we repeat the analysis of the inflationary cosmology in three - space . for the space dimension at the planck length @xmath24",
    "we get @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the dynamical character of the space dimension increases the number of e - foldings ( for constant three - space we have 58 e - foldings ) . using these e - foldings",
    ", we obtain the initial and final value of the inflaton field .",
    "there is a small shift in the value of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to larger values . in three - space",
    ", inflation ends at @xmath26sec .",
    "we show the end of inflation is @xmath27 sec by assuming the space dimension is a dynamical parameter .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a delayed chaotic inflation with variable space dimension . using the number of e - foldings",
    ", we also obtain the size of the universe at the beginning of inflationary epoch . for",
    "@xmath28 inflation starts from an initial size less than the planck length .",
    "we know that in three - space the initial size of the inflationary epoch is of the order of the planck length . particularly , for @xmath29 the initial size is less than the minimum size of the model , which is @xmath30 .",
    "so , we rule out the cases of @xmath31 in the model and conclude an upper limit for the space dimension at the planck length , @xmath32 .",
    "our results for an upper limit for the space dimension at the planck length is in agreement with previous result in @xcite .",
