    "single - molecule transistors have been intensively studied in recent years ( see , e.g. , the review in ref .  ) . the specific feature of these nanostructures is the presence of vibrational effects @xcite in electron transport .",
    "recently , effects of a strong electron - vibron interaction were observed in electron tunneling through suspended single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) @xcite and in carbon nanopeapods.@xcite in suspended carbon nanotubes an electron - vibron coupling is induced by the electrostatic interaction of the charge on a vibrating molecule with the metal electrodes .",
    "electrically excited vibrations result in such effects as phonon - assisted tunneling , @xcite franck - condon ( polaronic ) blockade @xcite and electron shuttling @xcite ( see also the reviews in refs .  ) .",
    "much less is known about the influence of a magnetic field on electron transport in molecular transistors .",
    "one can expect that a magnetic field , interacting with the electric current flowing through the system , will shift the position of the molecule inside the gap between the leads . for point - like electrodes this could result in a change of electron tunneling probabilities and as a consequence in a negative magnetoconductance . for suspended carbon",
    "nanotubes magnetic field - induced displacements ( due to the laplace force ) of the center - of - mass coordinate of the wire does not influence the absolute values of tunneling matrix elements .",
    "the magnetic influence emerges from a more subtle effect  the dependence of the phase of the electron tunneling amplitude on magnetic field ( aharonov - bohm phase ) .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that despite the 1d nature of electron transport in swnts , a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the quantum wire results in negative magnetoconductance due to quantum vibrations of the tube . at low temperatures",
    "( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the frequency of the vibrational bending mode of the tube ) the conductance , @xmath2 , of the tube is exponentially suppressed , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the effective magnetic flux , @xmath6 is the length of the wire , @xmath7 is the amplitude of zero - point fluctuations of the tube , @xmath8 is the flux quantum).@xcite at high temperatures ( @xmath9 ) the magnetic field - induced correction to the tunnel conductance scales as @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling properties of magnetoconductace predicted in ref .",
    "resemble the ones known for polaronic effects in electron transport through a vibrating quantum qot ( see , e.g. , the review in ref .  ) if one identifies the dimensionless flux @xmath11 with the electron - vibron coupling constant .",
    "so it is interesting to consider electron transport through a vibrating nano - wire in the model ( single - level qd ) when magneto - polaronic effects can be evaluated analytically . in ref .",
    "the resonant magneto - conductance of a vibrating single - level quantum dot was calculated in perturbation theory with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "it was shown in particular that unlike the case of electrically induced vibrations , where the peak conductance is known @xcite to be unaffected by vibrations , the magnetic field influences resonance conductance for an asymmetric junction .    the purpose of the present paper is to consider how the electrical current through a vibrating molecule depends on magnetic field and temperature in the limit of strong electron - vibron coupling , that is to consider _ magneto - polaronic _ effects .",
    ".   we model the vibrating molecule by a single - level quantum dot in a harmonic potential . for point - like contacts both the modulus and",
    "the phase of the electron tunneling amplitudes depend on the qd position in the gap between the leads .",
    "we will assume that the  longitudinal \" center - of - mass coordinate ( @xmath13 ) of the qd is fixed and that the quantum dot only vibrates along the @xmath14-direction , while the magnetic field @xmath15 is applied along @xmath16-axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "is placed in the gap between two point - like metal electrodes .",
    "the qd position @xmath17 on the @xmath18-axis is fixed and it vibrates ( depicted as a spring ) only along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "an external magnetic field is directed along the @xmath16-axis . ]    at first we calculate the tunneling current in the case when the displacement @xmath19 of the qd in a magnetic field ( due to the laplace force @xcite ) is greater than the amplitude of zero - point fluctuations , @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the qd mass ) .",
    "then the mechanical part of the problem can be treated classically and the dependence of electrical current on magnetic field appears due to the dependence of the electron tunneling probabilities on the equilibrium position of the current - carrying qd in the magnetic field .",
    "we show that in strong magnetic fields @xmath15 ( the appropriate limit for the considered classical problem ) the current scales as @xmath23 .    in the case when the bare tunneling probabilities do not depend on the qd displacement @xmath19 ( @xmath24 ) the magnetic field influences the current only through the phase factors ( aharonov - bohm phase ) in the tunneling hamiltonian (",
    "this is always the case for a suspended swnt ) .",
    "we considered magnetopolaronic effects in the regime of sequential electron tunneling and for resonant tunneling of polarons ( polaron tunneling approximation @xcite ) . in these cases analytical formulae for the current were derived .",
    "we predict : ( i ) a franck - condon ( polaronic ) blockade of magneto - conductance in the regime of sequential electron tunneling , ( ii ) an anomalous temperature dependence of magneto - conductance for strong electron - vibron coupling ( @xmath25 ) , ( iii ) a magnetic field - induced narrowing of resonant conductance peaks , and ( iv ) an excess current at high biases , @xmath26 .",

    "although simple estimations for a micron - sized nanotube - based device show that even in a very strong transverse magnetic field ( @xmath162 ) the magnetocurrent is only of the order of 0.1 pa , the effect is measurable and its fundamental nature justifies efforts to detect it .",

    "<S> magneto - polaronic effects are considered in electron transport through a single - level vibrating quantum dot subjected to a transverse ( to the current flow ) magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the effects are most pronounced in the regime of sequential electron tunneling , where a polaronic blockade of the current at low temperatures and an anomalous temperature dependence of the magnetoconductance are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for resonant tunneling of polarons the peak conductance is not affected by the magnetic field . </S>"
