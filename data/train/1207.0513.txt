    "have reached unprecedented precision .",
    "they serve both for exacting tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and for searches for hypothetical new interactions at the highest energy scales attained . within pqcd ,",

    "invariant mass distributions of dijets  @xcite , dijet angular distributions  @xcite , and other jet observables at the lhc  @xcite are examined to search for quark compositeness and heavy particle resonances .",
    "all these analyses depend on reliable theoretical computations that continue to evolve to stay on par with experimental developments .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", jet production has an advantage of very high statistics and a drawback of sizable systematic errors associated with the complexities of jet reconstruction .",
    "on the theory side , predictions for jet observables remain known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) only  @xcite .",
    "theoretical uncertainties due to the qcd scale dependence and the fixed - order model for the jet algorithm are comparable to the experimental errors .",
    "some phenomenological studies also include partial next - to - next - to - leading order contributions to jet cross sections obtained by threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "this paper describes meks , a program for predicting probabilities of observation of a single jet or of jet pairs that are accompanied by arbitrary final states , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "an early numerical code ( eks ) for the nlo calculation of single inclusive jet and dijet distributions was developed by s. d. ellis , z. kunszt and d. e. soper in the 1990 s  @xcite based on the subtraction method .",
    "the meks program is based on the original eks calculation that has been augmented by new elements to boost its stability , flexibility , and efficiency .",
    "two other widely used numerical programs are nlojet++  @xcite  a complete calculation of inclusive one and two jet cross sections at nlo ,  and fastnlo  @xcite , which provides a fast interpolation of nlojet++ cross sections in the kinematical bins of already published experimental measurements .",
    "besides these _ fixed - order _ calculations , powheg combines the nlo jet production cross sections with _ leading - logarithm _ qcd showering effects  @xcite .",
    "precision calculations for these processes are challenging because of the rapid falloff of the cross sections with the jet s @xmath7 and rapidity . in a typical experimental data set , jet cross sections vary by up to 6 - 9 orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , large numerical cancelations occur between some @xmath8 and @xmath9 contributions due to the presence of qcd singularities .",
    "meks undertakes several measures to handle these issues and to achieve relative accuracy of order one percent in the numerical simulations .",
    "the meks output is produced in the form of two - dimensional differential cross sections ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , ... ) after integration over the unobserved momentum components using the vegas method from the cuba2.1 library  @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo integration is automatically optimized to improve the speed of the calculation .",
    "the generated events are written into finely binned two - dimensional histograms that can be rebinned into any set of coarse bins of a given experiment at the stage of the user s final analysis .",
    "this format is different from the fastnlo format , which provides the cross sections in the coarse bins that are taken from pre - existing experimental publications .",
    "residual theoretical uncertainties in such an nlo calculation are currently comparable to typical experimental errors .",
    "thus , together with the meks code , we present a detailed benchmark comparison with the independent fastnlo code and comment on the stability of the nlo jet calculations with respect to the choice of qcd scales .",

    "a jet reveals itself by tracks and calorimeter energy depositions left by final - state hadrons in a collider detector .",
    "numerous particles comprise a typical jet , and their detailed distribution is complicated .",
    "nevertheless the probability for producing the whole jet can be deduced with high confidence from the cross section for production of the partons ( quarks or gluons ) that are the jet s progenitors .",

    "theoretical inputs must be selected carefully in the comparisons of nlo cross sections , since they may cause non - negligible differences in predictions .    *",
    "* jet algorithm .",
    "* when calculating the distribution of jet observables , we need to use the same jet algorithms as the ones in the experimental measurements . in a pqcd calculation ,",
    "the experimental jet algorithm is approximated by a measurement function @xmath69 that acts on a small number of partons .",
    "( see the previous section . )",
    "the cone - based midpoint algorithm  @xcite is most frequently used at the tevatron , while the cluster - based anti-@xmath58 algorithm  @xcite is in standard use at the lhc .",
    "the only difference between the midpoint algorithm and modified snowmass algorithm  @xcite used in the original eks program is that the midpoint algorithm always uses the midpoint of the two partons directions as one of the possible seeds for a new protojet . in the nlo theoretical calculations for single - jet or dijet production that include at most three final - state partons , the cluster - based @xmath58  @xcite , anti-@xmath58 , and cambridge - aachen ( ca )  @xcite algorithms are equivalent .",
    "the midpoint algorithm is generally different from these algorithms . * * the recombination scheme * is a procedure for merging two nearby partons into one jet .",
    "for example , the 4d scheme computes the jet s 4-momentum by adding the 4-momenta of the jet s constituents .",
    "the @xmath70 scheme finds the momentum of the merged jet by adding the scalar @xmath70 values , then averaging over the partons directions with the statistical weights given by the individual @xmath70 values @xcite .",
    "the 4d scheme is often adopted by the recent experiments at both the tevatron and lhc .",
    "different choices of the recombination scheme can cause differences in the nlo predictions , as will be shown later in the benchmark comparison section .",
    "note that , with the 4d scheme , the jet could be massive , which means that the jet s pseudorapidity will not be equal to its rapidity . * * the jet acceptance * conditions specify if the jet will be considered in the final observables .",
    "for example , to be taken into account , the total transverse momentum @xmath7 of the jet in the acceptance region must be larger than a threshold value @xmath71 of a few tens gev / c .",
    "in nlo calculations of single - inclusive jet distributions , the jet acceptance conditions practically have no effects . in dijet production",
    ", they may change the cross sections by small amounts by affecting the selection of two leading jets . * * renormalization and factorization scales . * the scale choice is only related to theory and has no correspondence in experiment .",
    "it is conventional to choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be of the order of the typical transverse momentum @xmath7 of the jet(s ) : @xmath72 . in contributions with two resolved jets",
    ", @xmath7 naturally corresponds to the transverse momentum of either of the final - state jets ( which are about equal by momentum conservation ) .",
    "more ambiguity is present in contributions with three resolved jets , when @xmath7 can correspond to the transverse momentum of either of the jets in each event or to a combination of three transverse momenta .",
    "the conventional choices made by experimentalists are to set both of the scales to individual jet @xmath7 for single inclusive jet production and to the average @xmath7 of the two leading jets for dijet production .      for completeness , we provide definitions of typical kinematical variables arising in recent measurements .",
    "the _ leading jet _ has the largest transverse momentum @xmath73 among all jets in each scattering event . * single - inclusive jet",
    "* cross sections may refer either to distributions of the leading jets or individual jets ( so that all jets hitting a particular kinematic bin in every event are counted ) .",
    "currently , meks has a built - in mode for computing single - inclusive distributions of individual jets , although distributions for the leading jets can be easily implemented . the transverse momentum and rapidity of the individual jet",
    "are denoted by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .    in * dijet production , *",
    "kinematical variables are formed from the four - momenta of the first and second leading jets , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "common distributions are given in terms of the dijet s invariant mass @xmath77 , the maximal absolute rapidity value @xmath78 in the jet pair , and the angular variable @xmath79 .",
    "the goal of the meks program is to calculate double - differential cross sections for single - inclusive jet or dijet production at hadron colliders up to nlo in qcd .",

    "the input parameters are read from several ` .card ` files . in view of the rapid falloff of the cross section across the available phase space region ,",
    "the integration volume is divided into subregions which are handled separately , and additional optimization is performed to achieve percent - level accuracy in each subregion .",
    "the integration runs in a sequence of three steps .",
