    "this is the part i of an intended series on a comprehensive theory of complex systems @xcite .",
    "taking living biological cells as an archetype and biochemical kinetic approach as a paradigm , we consider a system _ complex _ if it contains many interacting subpopulations of individuals that undergo non - deterministic state transitions , and it interacts with its environment through active transports of matters and energy , or information . for examples ,",
    "tumor is a community of heterogeneous individual cells ; economy concerns with individual agents , and ecology deals with various biological organisms .",
    "the above `` definition '' of a complex system immediately reminds us several major areas of studies : nonequilibrium thermodynamics , statistical physics , nonlinear dynamics , stochastic processes , and information theory are some of the widely acknowledged .",
    "ours , however , is not a `` new '' theory , rather it is a coherent narrative that synthesizes a wide range of methodologies and thoughts mentioned above .",
    "one can easily find in our writting significant influences from the various theories on complexity : the brussels school of thermodynamics that describes nonequilibrium phenomena in terms of chemical affinity and entropy production @xcite ; the theory of synergetics which articulates the ideas of nonequilibrium potential and phase transition , as well as slaving principle as an emergent phenomenon near a critical point @xcite ; the notion of symmetry breaking from the phase transition lore in condensed matter physics @xcite ; catastrophe theory in connection to nonlinear bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the unique features of our approach are as follows : first , we have two concrete examples of complex chemical systems in mind : a single protein molecule , which consists of a large collection of heterogeneous atoms , in an aqueous solution as a non - driven ( closed ) chemical system @xcite , and a single cell , which consists of a large number of different biomolecular species , in a culture medium as a driven open chemical system @xcite . while closed and open chemical systems have fundamentally different thermodynamics , some of the key aspects of stochastic nonlinear dynamics are remarkably consistent : 1 ) nonlinearity gives rise to discrete states , e.g. , conformational states of a protein and epi - genetic states of a cell ; 2 ) stochasticity yields discrete transitions among the states on a much longer time scale .",
    "both systems can be mathematically described in terms of stochastic nonlinear kinetics .",
    "the second feature of our approach is following what the stochastic , nonlinear mathematics tells us @xcite . for examples : i ) for many of the stochastic models of open chemical system",
    ", one can prove the existence of a unique , ergodic steady state probability distribution , even though its computation is often challenging toward which significant past research has been directed .",
    "but the latter should not prevent one to develop a theory based on such a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) potential function .",
    "indeed , we can show that the mere recognition of its existence provides great logical consistency and theoretical insights in a theory .",
    "ii ) for markov stochastic processes under a set of rather weak conditions , one can show a set of mathematical theorems that have remarkable resemblance to the theory of chemical thermodynamics , _  la _ gibbs , and lewis and randall @xcite .",
    "iii ) for any stochastic dynamics with a macroscopic bistability as fluctuations tending to zero ( @xmath3 ) , symmetry breaking in the limit of @xmath3 followed by time @xmath1 is a necessary consequence of the catastrophe in the nonlinear dynamics , obtained from @xmath3 precedes @xmath1 .",
    "while these mathematical results stand on their own , their significance to our understanding of complex systems requires a narrative that is constructed based on all the past theories , thoughts , and discussions .",
    "the stochastic nonlinear dynamic description of complex systems embodies two of the essential ingredients of darwin s theory of biological evolution : chance , variation , diversity on the one hand and necessity , selection on the other @xcite .",
    "the chemical kinetic theory of living cells based on the delbrck - gillespie process @xcite allows one to see how various abstract `` forces of nature '' emerge and play out in a complex system , with individual players as simple , or as complex , as macromolecules .",
    "mechanics and chemistry offer two very different perspectives of a complex system : the former considers the world made of featureless individuals , the _ point masses _ , with precise positions and velocities ; the latter , however , entertains a world made of many types of individuals , each with different internal characteristics . due to the uniqueness of space and time , each and every point mass is unique . on the other hand ,",
    "modern studies have shown that individual single molecules in aqueous solution behavior differently : they have _ individualities _ @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , when dealing with many - body systems , even fluid mechanics and quantum mechanics turn their representations from tracking the state of individual particles to counting the numbers : the switching from lagrangian to eulerian descriptions in the former and second quantization in the latter .    the `` chemical kinetic view '' of",
    "the complex world goes much beyond chemistry : reaction @xmath4 is known as autocatalysis in chemistry , with the @xmath5 being a reactant and @xmath6 being its product which also serves as a catalyst for a transformation of an @xmath5 to an @xmath6 .",
    "the same `` kinetic scheme '' also describes infection in an epidemiological dynamics , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 representing susceptible and infectious individuals , respectively .",
    "in fact , we argue that much of the complex systems beyond chemistry contain interacting subpopulations of individuals that undergo non - deterministic state transitions .",
    "the chemical view actually offers a reasonable organization of p. w. anderson s @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the hierarchical structure of science @xcite : @xmath9 we note that each @xmath7 in the left column consists of collections of `` individuals '' characterized by the @xmath8 on the right .",
    "is a biochemical macromolecule , a protein , immersed in an aqueous solution simple or complex ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on one s perspective , and time scale @xcite . from the standpoint of molecular physics and in terms of the large number of atoms that are constantly in collisions with each other and with solvent molecules , this is a quite complex system which has its own emergent phenomenon .",
    "the mechanical motions described by a newtonian molecular dynamics ( md ) with solvent molecules being explicitly treated , usually on the time scale of femtosecond ( 10@xmath10 sec . ) , exhibit great complexity . yet , the notions of `` reaction coordinate '' ( e.g. , order parameter ) and `` transition state '' ( e.g. , critical state ) , plus a single rate constant which is on the microsecond to millisecond time scale , fully describe the exponential law for an elementary , unimolecular chemical reaction .",
    "this emergent phenomenon has been mathematically described in h. a. kramers stochastic , nonlinear theory of energy barrier crossing @xcite , and the rigorous mathematics of freidlin - wentzell theory @xcite .      just as point mass is a fundamental concept in mechanics , _ elemetary reaction _ is a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics : a reaction like @xmath11 is said to be elementary if the discrete event of transformation has an exponentially distributed waiting time with rate @xmath12 , which is a function of numbers of the reactants , @xmath13 , in a reaction vessel with volume @xmath0 .",
    "if the rate @xmath12 has the form of @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the number of molecule @xmath16 in the vessel . then we said the reaction follows the law of mass action with rate constant @xmath17 . in a macroscopic sized system , in terms of concentrations",
    "@xmath18 , the reaction flux in ( [ meso - flux ] ) becomes @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is the concentration of the reactant @xmath16 .",
    "for example , the nonlinear kinetic system @xmath21 has a macroscopic kinetic equation following the law of mass action @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the concentrations of chemical species @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath26 , respectively . in the mathematical theory of infectious diseases , however , the same set of equations represent the sir model @xcite .",
    "the population dynamics of species in an infectious disease , in ecological dynamics , and chemical species in a rapid stirred reaction vessel , actually share a great deal of commonality : they are all complex nonlinear systems consisting of heterogeneous interacting individuals .",
    "the readers are referred to the earlier review articles @xcite and the recent text @xcite .",
    "the notion of elementary reactions as presented above is fundamentally a stochastic one in which a chemical reaction in an aqueous solution is represented by a rare event in the many - body , heterogeneous atomic system .",
    "each reaction as a single random event is the focus of the kramers theory whose prediction is that , when the barrier is high , all the complex atomic motions in a unimolecular transition can be represented by a single parameter , the rate constant @xmath17 . for bimolecular reactions ,",
    "a diffusion based theory in three - dimensional physical space was first proposed by m. von smolochowski ( 1917 ) , and further developed by collins and kimball ( 1949 ) , a. szabo and his coworkers @xcite .    while kramers theory connects stochastic molecular state transitions to the motions of the constitutive atoms , a cell consists of a great many macromolecules and biochemical reactions .",
    "the delbrck - gillespie process describes the stochastic kinetics of such a system , with two complementary representations : either in terms of the random , fluctuating number of all molecular species , @xmath27 @xmath28 $ ] that follows gillespie algorithm @xcite , or in terms of the probability distribution @xmath29 @xmath30 that satisfies the chemical master equation ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "this theory of mesoscopic stochastic chemical kinetics has rapidly become a mature subject in recent years @xcite .",
    "we use the term `` mesoscopic '' in partial agreement with van kampen @xcite , ch .",
    "iii , p. 57",
    ", who stated that `` [ t]he stochastic description in terms of macroscopic variables ... it comprises both the deterministic laws and the fluctuations about them '' . there is an important difference , however : what implicitly assumed by van kampen and physicists of his time was a top - down , macroscopic law known first followed by fluctuations theory ; it is a phenomenological approach pioneered by einstein .",
    "the stochastic chemical kinetic theory is different . with a foundation laid by kramers theory ,",
    "a stochastic chemical kinetic model is _ mechanistic_. the deterministic laws then can be mathematically derived , as has been shown by t. g. kurtz @xcite .",
    "this conceptual distinction also leads to an essential practical difference : the `` noise structure '' in the traditional top - down models can only be determined by additional assumptions , e.g. , fluctuation - dissipation relation for equilibrium fluctuations . the noise structure in a delbrck - gillespie model",
    "is completely specified by the chemical kinetics .",
    "the most general setup for a mesoscopic chemical kinetics in a rapidly stirred reaction vessel with volume @xmath0 considers @xmath31 chemical species and @xmath32 elementary chemical reactions : @xmath33 in which both @xmath34 are functions of @xmath35 and @xmath0 , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 are stoichiometric coefficients for the forward and the backward reactions @xmath38 .    in applied mathematics , compared with what we know abut ordinary differential equations beyond the existence and uniqueness theorems , we currently know very little about the delbrck - gillespie process .",
    "it is widely agreed upon that thermodynamic behavior is an emergent phenomenon of systems with a large number of components .",
    "l. boltzmann s attempt to provide macroscopic thermodynamics with a newtonian mechanical foundation has provided continuous inspiration for understand complexity .",
    "consider a mechanical system , a box of gas with volume @xmath0 and number of particles @xmath31 , described by hamiltonian dynamic equation @xmath39 and @xmath40 . according to boltzmann",
    "s fundamental insight @xcite , a macroscopic thermodynamic state is a state of motion , the entire level set of @xmath41 , which is determined by the initial condition of the differential equation . then entropy @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the phase volume contained by the level set .",
    "thus there exists a definitive function @xmath44 .",
    "it then follows from elementary calculus : @xmath45 in which @xmath46 is identified as temperature , @xmath47 is identified as pressure , and @xmath48 is mechanical work .",
    "@xmath49 is called chemical potential .",
    "consequently thermodynamic quantities such as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are emergent concepts themselves .",
    "however , for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 clear _ mechanical interpretation _ have been found : @xmath50 being mean kinetic energy and @xmath51 the momentum transfer upon collision of gaseous molecules on the wall of the box .",
    "however , one yet to find a clear mechanical interpretation for @xmath52 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath52 has a @xmath53 part and a log concentration ( or mole fraction ) part .",
    "the current molecular theory of @xmath53 is based on molecular mechanics , which treats atoms in a molecule as point mass etc . in the past",
    ", molecules has been understood through mechanics , classical or quantum .",
    "the entire living phenomena are mostly driven by @xmath54 , not @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "chemistry kinetics offers a concrete example of complex systems .",
    "biological systems are archetypes of complex system .",
    "why biological and complex systems look so different from those in physics ?",
    "j. j. hopfield @xcite , together with many other condensed matter physicists @xcite , have all pointed to the information content of a system , and the notion of _ symmetry breaking _ as the key elements of complex systems @xcite .",
    "the notion of symmetry breaking , in a broad sense , is best illustrated in a mesoscopic kinetics with finite volume @xmath0 : when @xmath0 is small , the markov dynamics is ergodic .",
    "multi - stability in this system is represented by multiple peaks of the stationary probability distribution @xmath57 @xcite . however , when @xmath2 , the different peak regions correspond to different basins of attraction according to the systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that follow the law of mass action .",
    "the dynamics of the deterministic odes has broken ergodicity : dynamics starts in one basin will never go to another basin .",
    "more interestingly , if one takes the limit of @xmath2 after @xmath1 in the mesoscopic kinetic model , it predicts the system has only a single attractor with probability 1 .",
    "in fact , the stationary probability distribution    @xmath58    in which @xmath59 has a global minimum of 0 , at which the entire probability will concentrate when @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "phase transition occurs when the global minimum of @xmath59 is not unique .",
    "a summary of the standard formalism of macroscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( net ) in continuous medium , as introduced in @xcite , can also be found in @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the existence of a special macroscopic function @xmath60 $ ] , the instantaneous entropy density , is hypothesized via the _ local equilibrium assumption _ , which yields @xmath61 , \\label{lea}\\ ] ] in which @xmath62 is internal energy density , @xmath63 is the concentration of the @xmath64th chemical species , @xmath50 and @xmath65 are temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "the theory of net then proceeds as follows :    ( @xmath66 ) establishing continuity equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are energy and particle fluxes in space , and @xmath71 is the rate of the @xmath72th reaction with stoichiometric coefficients @xmath73 ;    ( @xmath74 ) substituting the @xmath75 s and @xmath12 s into ( [ lea ] ) ;    ( @xmath76 ) grouping appropriate terms to obtain the density of entropy production rate , @xmath77 , as `` transport flux @xmath78 thermodynamics force '' , _  la _ onsager .",
    "the remaining part is the entropy exchange flux @xmath79 : @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath23 in the above macroscopic net represents the real three - dimensional physical space .",
    "one can apply a similar approach to a dynamics in phase space , as bergmann and lebowitz s stochastic liouville dynamics @xcite , or the space of internal degrees of freedom initiated by prigogine and mazur @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the theory of mesoscopic net proceeds as follows :    \\i ) introducing the entropy , or free energy , as a functional of the probability distribution @xmath81 , @xmath82 for a discrete system , or probability density function @xmath83 ; @xmath84 , for a continuous system .",
    "the introduction of entropy function in the mesoscopic theory does not rely on the local equilibrium assumption .",
    "rather , one follows the fundamental idea of l. boltzmann : the entropy is a functional characterizing the * _ statistics _ * of phase space .",

[ sec : sld ] ) and the recently developed stochastic thermodynamics ( sec .",
    "[ sec : meso - stoch - net ] ) , the scientific narratives are quite different .",
    "the goal for the former is to use meso - net to _ derive _ the dynamics equations for fluctuations of macroscopic quantities @xcite ; more specifically , fokker - planck equation for probability density function @xmath83 . to illustrate this ,",
    "one starts with the @xmath83 that necessarily satisfies a continuity equation in a phase space :    @xmath89    and non - adiabatic entropy production , or free energy dissipation @xcite : @xmath90 in which the _ local density _ of non - adiabatic entropy production rate @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the flux and the @xmath93 $ ] is the thermodynamic force : the gradient of the local chemical potential function .",
    "one also notices that the thermodynamic force @xmath94 $ ] can be further decomposed into @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the thermodynamic variables conjugate to @xmath97 .",
    "readers with a college chemistry background should recognize this as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .    now here comes as the point of departure between the narrative of meso - net and the narrative of stochastic thermodynamics : the former evokes onsager s linear force - flux relation @xmath100 note this relation is simply a generalized fick s law .",
    "then it is well - known that combining continuity equation ( [ conti - eq ] ) with fick s law ( [ gfl ] ) yields the fokker - planck equation .    to `` justify '' the stochastic descriptions of mesoscopic dynamics",
    "is one of the fundamental tasks of statistical physics .",
    "beside this meso - net approach , there are many others : bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy , mori - zwanzig ( mz ) projection , markov partition and kolmogorov - sinai entropy method , etc .",
    "since the meso - net approach is based on onsager s linear relation , its validity is limited in the linear irreversible regime .",
    "we note that for a discrete @xmath101 : @xmath102 however , the flux @xmath75 is linearly related to the thermodynamic potential difference @xmath54 .",
    "the same logic will not work for the stochastic dynamics of mesoscopic chemical kinetics .",
    "the linear fick s law and its alike are phenomenological relations .",
    "derivation of the macroscopic diffusion equation based on this line of arguments naturally leads to more general _ nonlinear diffusion equation _ @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck equation in phase space , however , has a much more fundamental origin : it is a mathematical consequence of chapman - kolmogorov s integral equation for any markov process with continuous path in @xmath103 @xcite . in current stochastic thermodynamics , one takes the stochastic , markov dynamics as given .",

    "it is a dynamic counterpart of gibbs canonical ensemble rather than microcanonical ensemble .    while the macro - net uses local equilibrium assumption to introduce the entropy function and secures gibbs equation ( [ gibbs - eq ] ) , the stoc - net introduces entropy function following boltzmann s and shannon s fundamental insights : it is a functional of the probability distribution in the phase space .",
