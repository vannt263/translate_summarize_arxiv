    "recently , planck surveyor has been successfully launched , and is measuring cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy with very fine angular resolution . using cmb data , we may test cosmological hypotheses and impose significant constraints on cosmological models @xcite . for the past years",
    ", wmap data have gone through scrutiny , and various anomalies have been reported @xcite . in direct relevance to this letter , land and et al .",
    "have noted odd point - parity preference in wmap data , but found its statistical significance was not high , given their estimator @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we revisit the point - parity of the wmap data with a slightly different estimator , and report the odd - parity preference of the wmap power spectrum data at 99.6% level .",
    "for a whole - sky cmb analysis , temperature anisotropy @xmath1 is conveniently decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a decomposition coefficient , and @xmath5 is a sky direction .",
    "for a gaussian seed fluctuation model , decomposition coefficients satisfy the following statistical properties : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the average over the ensemble of universes .    cdm model ( red ) , wmap 5 year data ( blue ) , wmap 3 year data ( green ) ]    given a standard cosmological model , we expect sach - wolf plateau for cmb power spectrum on low multipoles @xcite : @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ cl_cut ] , we show the wmap 5 year , 3 year data and the theoretical power spectrum of the wmap concordance model @xcite . in comparison with wmap 3 year data ,",
    "wmap 5 year data is expected to have more accurate calibration and less foreground contamination @xcite .",
    "spherical harmonics behave under parity inversion as follows @xcite : @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , power asymmetry between even and odd multipoles may be thought as power asymmetry between even and odd parity map , because a map consisting of even(odd ) multipoles possesses even(odd ) parity .",
    "hereafter , we will denote it as ` parity asymmetry ' .",

    "[ delta ] , we show @xmath11 at low multipoles . as shown in fig .",
    "[ delta ] , most of them posses negative values , which indicates there exist power deficit ( excess ) in comparison to the @xmath10cdm model at most of even ( odd ) multipoles . in the case of wmap5 data , there is only 3 points of positive values among 18 data points .",
    "a order - of - magnitude estimation shows that such events require the odd of @xmath12 .",
    "however , power spectrum is estimated from cut - sky data to avoid diffuse galactic foreground contamination .",
    "therefore , statistical fluctuation in estimated @xmath13 is correlated among multipoles . in order to investigate odd of the parity asymmetry rigorously ,",
    "we have produced @xmath14 simulated cmb maps ( healpix nside=8 ) of gaussian @xmath10cdm model .",
    "we have degraded the wmap processing mask ( nside=16 ) to nside=8 , and set pixels to zero , if any of their daughter pixels is zero . after applying the mask ,",
    "we have estimated power spectrum from cut - sky maps by a pixel - based maximum - likelihood method .",
    "instrument noise is neglected in simulation , since noise is subdominant on multipoles of interest ( e.g. s / n @xmath15 for @xmath13 at @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "bearing eq .",
    "[ plateau ] in mind , we consider the following quantities : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the greatest integer smaller than or equal to the argument .",
    "using the wmap power spectrum data and simulations respectively , we have computed the ratio @xmath19 for various multipole ranges @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is between 3 and 23 . by comparing @xmath19 of the wmap data with simulation , we have estimated @xmath22-value , where @xmath22-value denotes fractions of simulations as low as @xmath19 of the wmap data .     as low as wmap data for multipole range @xmath23 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ pvalue ] , we show @xmath22-value of wmap5 and wmap3 respectively for various @xmath21 . fig .",
    "[ pvalue ] shows lowest @xmath22-value for @xmath24 , where @xmath22-values are @xmath25 and @xmath26 for wmap5 and wmap3 respectively . in other words",
    ", there exists anomalous odd - parity preference at multipoles ( @xmath0 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pvalue ] , wmap5 possesses more anomalous odd - parity preference than wmap3 , while wmap5 data have more accurate calibration and less foreground contamination @xcite .",
    "therefore , we find it unlikely that calibration or foregrounds are the source of the anomaly .",
    "it should be also noted that the anomaly is associated with the wmap power spectrum data , in which most efforts have been exerted to minimize systematics .",
    "it has been known that cmb quadrupole power of wmap data is unusually low , compared with the theoretical value @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may attribute the anomalous parity asymmetry of the wmap data to low quadrupole power . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pvalue ] , the parity asymmetry persists over extended range of multipoles , and the parity asymmetry on multipoles ( @xmath0 ) is most anomalous .",
    "therefore , we may not simply attribute the parity asymmetry to low quadrupole power . for multipole range ( @xmath0 ) , we find @xmath27 is most likely , while @xmath19 of wmap5 and wmap3 are 0.69 and 0.734 respectively . in fig .",

    "is attributed to the increased statistical fluctuation in cut - sky @xmath13 estimation . by using whole - sky simulations ,",
    "we have also investigated @xmath22-value for @xmath28 , but have not found the statistical significance as high as @xmath24 .",
    "in the previous study @xcite , the parity asymmetry under point reflection as well as mirror reflection was noted , but point - parity was not given enough attention , since they found the statistical significance was not high .",
    "investigating the wmap power spectrum with a slightly different estimator , we found the odd - parity preference of the wmap data ( @xmath0 ) at 99.6% level ( mask ) and at 99.76% level ( no mask ) .",
    "higher parity asymmetry in wmap5 data indicates that wmap systematics is unlikely to be the source for the parity asymmetry .",
    "however , we do not completely rule out non - cosmological origins , and defer a rigorous investigation on cosmological or non - cosmological origin to a separate publication",
    ".    one may attribute low @xmath19 of the wmap data simply to low quadrupole power .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pvalue ] , the anomalous parity asymmetry ( i.e. low @xmath22-value ) persists over extended range of multipoles .",
    "therefore , we find it rather likely that low quadrupole power is part of this parity asymmetry anomaly .",
    "it was also shown that hemispherical power asymmetry is much more anomalous at multipoles ( @xmath29 ) than multipoles ( @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "given all these circumstantial evidences , we find it likely that there exists an underlying common origin for the anomalies ( e.g. hemispherical power asymmetry , low quadrupole power and parity asymmetry ) , whether it may be cosmological or wmap systematics .",
