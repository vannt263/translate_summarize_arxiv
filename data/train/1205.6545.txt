    "since the dawn of lattice field theory @xcite , the doubling problem of fermions has been a notorious obstacle to lattice simulations . among several prescriptions for this problem , the wilson fermion simply bypasses the no - go theorem @xcite by introducing a species - splitting mass term into the naive lattice fermion .",
    "this wilson term is regarded as one example of  flavored - mass terms \" which split original 16 fermion species into plural branches @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that the flavored - mass terms can also be constructed for staggered fermions @xcite in ref .",
    "the original purpose of introducing these terms was establishment of the index theorem with staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "a bonus here is that staggered fermions with the flavored - mass terms can be applied to lattice qcd simulations as wilson fermion and an overlap kernel .",
    "one possible advantage of these novel formulations , called staggered - wilson and staggered - overlap , is reduction of matrix sizes in the dirac operators , which would lead to reduction of numerical costs in lattice simulations .",
    "the numerical advantage in the staggered - overlap fermion have been shown in @xcite . now further study is required toward lattice qcd with these lattice fermions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to reveal properties of staggered - wilson fermions in terms of the parity - phase structure ( aoki phase ) @xcite . as is well - known",
    ", the existence of the aoki phase and the second - order phase boundary in wilson - type fermions enables us to perform lattice qcd simulations by taking a chiral limit since the critical behavior near the phase boundary reproduces massless pions and the pcac relation .",
    "besides , understanding the phase structure also gives practical information for the application of the overlap @xcite and domain - wall @xcite versions , both built on the wilson - type kernel .",
    "thus , in order to judge applicability of these new lattice fermions , it is essential to investigate the aoki phase in the staggered - wilson fermions . the phase structure for the staggered - wilson fermion",
    "was first studied by using the gross - neveu model in ref .",
    "@xcite and the present paper shows further investigation of this topic .    in this paper , we investigate strong - coupling lattice qcd @xcite with emphasis on parity - phase structure for two types of staggered - wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "firstly we discuss discrete symmetries of staggered - wilson fermions , and show that physical parity and charge conjugation can be defined in both cases while hypercubic symmetry depends on types of staggered - wilson fermions .",
    "secondly , we perform hopping - parameter expansion and effective potential analysis for meson fields in the strong - coupling limit . for this purpose ,",
    "we develop a method to derive the effective potential for lattice fermions with multiple - hopping terms .",
    "the gap equations show that pion condensate becomes non - zero in some range of a mass parameter , which indicates that parity - broken phase appears in this range .",
    "we also study meson masses around the second - order phase boundary , and find that massless pions and pcac relations are reproduced .",
    "lastly , we discuss parity - flavor symmetry breaking for 2-flavor cases .",
    "these results suggest that we can take a chiral limit by tuning a mass parameter in lattice qcd with staggered - wilson fermions as with the wilson fermion .",

    "sec : sd ] , we devote ourselves to a summary and discussion .",
    "before looking into staggered - wilson fermions , we review the wilson fermion and its relatives .",
    "the wilson term splits 16 species of naive fermions into 5 branches with 1 , 4 , 6 , 4 and 1 fermions .",
    "we call this kind of species - splitting terms  flavored - mass terms \" .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there are 4 types of flavored - mass terms for naive fermion which satisfy @xmath0 hermiticity .",
    "( @xmath0 in the naive fermion is flavored such as @xmath1 in the spin - flavor representation . )",
    "all these terms with proper mass shifts lead to a second derivative term as @xmath2 up to @xmath3 errors . thus we can regard them as cousins of wilson fermion .",
    "there are also non - trivial flavored - mass terms for staggered fermions , which split 4 tastes into branches and satisfy @xmath0 hermiticity .",
    "since @xmath0 is expressed in spin - taste representation as @xmath4 in this case , we only have two flavored - mass terms satisfying @xmath0 hermiticity : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "( for larger discrete symmetry one needs to take a proper sum for @xmath7 in the latter case . )",
    "these spin - flavor representations translate into four- and two - hopping terms in the one - component staggered action up to @xmath8 errors .",
    "the first type is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 the second type is given by @xmath11 + \\mathcal{o}(a ) \\ , \\label{hoelm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 we refer to @xmath13 and @xmath14 as the adams- @xcite and hoelbling - type @xcite , respectively .",
    "the former splits the 4 tastes into two branches with positive mass and the other two with negative mass .",
    "these two branches correspond to @xmath15 and @xmath16 eigenvalues of @xmath0 in the taste space .",
    "the latter splits them into one with positive mass , two with zero mass and the other one with negative mass .",
    "we note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are also derived from the flavored mass terms for naive fermions through spin - diagonalization as shown in @xcite .",
    "now we introduce a wilson parameter @xmath19 and shift mass as in wilson fermions @xcite .",

    "for some negative value of the mass parameter : @xmath24 for adams - type and @xmath25 for hoelbling - type , we obtain two - flavor and one - flavor overlap fermions respectively by using the overlap formula in principle .",
    "in this section , we discuss discrete symmetry of staggered - wilson fermions .",
    "a potential problem with staggered - wilson fermions in lattice qcd is discrete symmetry breaking . as discussed in @xcite , the discrete symmetry possessed by the original staggered fermion",
    "is broken to its subgroup both in the adams - type and hoelbling - type actions . we below list all the staggered discrete symmetries ( shift , axis reversal , rotation and charge conjugation ) , and look into their status in staggered - wilson fermions .",
    "shift transformation is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is obvious that this transformation flips the sign of both flavored - mass terms .",
    "the adams type is invariant under the two - shift subgroup as @xmath31 while the hoelbling type is invariant under four - shift subgroup as @xmath32 .",
    "note that these subgroups include the doubled shift @xmath33 as their subgroup .",
    "the axis reversal transformation is given by , @xmath34 with @xmath35 is the axis reversal @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "it again flips the sign of the flavored - mass terms .",
    "the staggered rotational transformation is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the rotation @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] with @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "it is notable that the adams - type fermion keeps this staggered rotation symmetry while the hoelbling type loses it .",
    "the staggered charge conjugation transformation is given by @xmath48 the adams - type fermion keeps this symmetry while the hoelbling type loses it .",
    "we next elucidate residual subgroups possessed by staggered - wilson fermions , and discuss how to define physical discrete symmetries as parity , charge conjugation and hypercubic symmetry .",
    "for this purpose we separate spin and flavor rotations in the above transformations . here",
    "we utilize the momentum - space representation in @xcite . in this representation",
    "we can define two set of clifford generators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which operate on spinor and flavor spaces in the momentum - space field @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "( details are shown in appendix .",
    "[ sfs ] . )",
    "then the shift transformation translates into @xmath52 the axis reversal translates into @xmath53 the rotational transformation translates into @xmath54 by using this representation we figure out residual discrete symmetries of staggered - wilson fermions as follows .",
    "we first consider parity .",
    "both staggered - wilson fermions are invariant under @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "this is essentially the continuum parity transformation @xcite . in the continuum",
    "limit the phase factor disappears and it results in the continuum parity transformations @xmath57 for the dirac fermion . we thus conclude both staggered - wilson fermions possess symmetry leading to physical parity symmetry @xmath58 .",
    "we note the simple combination of @xmath59-shift and @xmath59-axis reversal ( shifted - axis reversal:@xmath60 ) is also a symmetry of both fermions .",
    "we next consider physical charge conjugation . in the case of adams",
    "fermion the staggered charge conjugation symmetry @xmath61 in eq .",

    "thus , physical charge conjugation for the two - flavor branch can be formed in a similar way to usual staggered fermions as shown in @xcite ( @xmath62 ) . on the other hand ,",
