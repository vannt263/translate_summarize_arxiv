    "<S> we demonstrate that persistent current in meso- and nanorings may fluctuate down to zero temperature provided the current operator does not commute with the total hamiltonian of the system . for a model of a quantum particle on a ring </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly evaluate pc noise power which has a form of sharp peaks which become broadened for multi - channel rings or in the presence of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> pc noise can be tuned by an external magnetic flux which is a fundamental manifestation of quantum coherence in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> persistent currents ( pc ) in normal meso- and nanorings pierced by external magnetic flux is one of fundamental consequences of quantum coherence of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> while the average value of pc was intensively investigated in the literature during last decades , not much is known about equilibrium fluctuations od pc . at non - zero @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> it is quite natural to expect non - vanishing thermal fluctuations of pc . </S>",
    "<S> but at @xmath1 the system approaches its ( non - degenerate ) ground state and , hence , at the first sight no pc fluctuations would be possible . </S>",
    "<S> below we will demonstrate that this naive conclusion is in general not quite correct : no pc fluctuations are expected in the zero temperature limit only provided the current operator commutes with the total hamiltonian of the system , otherwise fluctuations of persistent current occur even in the ground state exactly at @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple model of a quantum particle with mass @xmath3 on a 1d ring of radius @xmath4 pierced by magnetic flux @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the particle position on the ring is parameterized by the angle @xmath6 , which is the quantum mechanical variable of interest in our problem . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for this system reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( dimensionless ) flux operator , @xmath9 defines the potential profile for our particle , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> the collective variable @xmath12 represents all other degrees of freedom interacting with the particle . </S>",
    "<S> note that within our model the interaction term involves only the coordinate ( not momentum ) operator . </S>",
    "<S> such models were previously studied in a number of papers @xcite in the context of various dissipative environments and , in addition , could be of interest for the problem of pc in superconducting nanorings in the presence of quantum phase slips @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us define the current operator in the schrdinger representation @xmath13=\\frac{e(\\hat\\phi + \\phi_x)}{2\\pi      mr^2}.\\ ] ] in the heisenberg picture the current operator is given by standard formula @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> let us also introduce the equilibrium current - current correlation function @xmath15 and define pc noise power @xmath16 employing the full set of eigenstates @xmath17 after a straightforward calculation we obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the grand partition function for our system , @xmath21 is some constant .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that pc noise power has the form of peaks at frequencies equal to the distance between the energy levels with non - zero matrix elements of the current operator plus an additional peak at zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in the zero temperature limit @xmath22 the amplitude of this peak tends to zero and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ so ] ) reduces to @xmath23 this result demonstrates that pc fluctuations indeed persist down to @xmath2 in which case peaks of pc noise power @xmath24 occur at frequencies corresponding to transitions between energy levels for which the matrix elements of the current operator differ from zero . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> pc correlator differs from zero dwn to zero temperature provided the current operator does not commute with the total hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a specific feature of pc noise is the dependence of @xmath24 on the external magnetic flux @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence occurs due to the presence of quantum coherence in the system and disappears if this coherence gets destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , such sensitivity of pc noise spectrum to the flux can be used as a measure of quantum coherence in our system .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that , while the above results hold for a single particle on a ring , in other situations pc noise spectrum might look differently . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , broadening of such peaks inevitably occurs in ensembles of rings or individual rings with many conducting channels . in this case the total pc noise produced by the system is given by the sum of a large number of very close peaks effectively resulting in a much smoother and broader noise spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , in the presence of dissipation due to interaction of the particle with other ( quantum ) degrees of freedom the energy levels acquire a finite width , the peaks get broadened and the noise power should differ from zero also in a wider range of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> two examples will be considered below .    </S>",
    "<S> our first example is a particle on the ring in periodical potential . </S>",
    "<S> let us employ the imaginary time technique and define the generating functional @xmath26=\\int_0^{2\\pi } d\\theta_0\\sum\\limits_{m=-\\infty}^\\infty e^{2\\pi im\\phi_x}\\int\\limits^{\\theta_0 + 2\\pi m}_{\\theta_0}\\mathcal d\\theta e^{-\\int\\limits_0^\\beta d\\tau\\left(\\frac{mr^2\\dot \\theta^2}{2}+u(\\theta)-i\\zeta\\dot \\theta\\right)}. \\label{genf}\\ ] ] this functional enables one to evaluate all imaginary - time current cumulants by taking the derivatives with respect to the source field @xmath27 and , hence , to establish  full - counting statistics  of pc in our problem . </S>",
    "<S> real - time correlators might be obtained by analytic continuation .    for the sake of definiteness below </S>",
    "<S> we will set @xmath28 , i.e. we will assume that the particle on a 1d ring is moving in a periodic potential with the distance @xmath29 between the adjacent minima . </S>",
    "<S> the potential barriers between these minima will be assumed high , @xmath30 , in which case the particle moves around the ring due to hopping from one minimum to another . </S>",
    "<S> semiclassically , these hops are described by multi - instanton trajectories @xmath31 with @xmath32 , which dominate the path integral ( [ genf ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is well known kink solution , describing the particle tunneling with the amplitude @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . substituting the trajectories @xmath36 into eq . </S>",
