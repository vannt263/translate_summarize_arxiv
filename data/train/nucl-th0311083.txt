    ", nuclear matter exhibits the coexistence of a liquid phase with a gas phase due to the internucleon interaction which has an attractive part . in the density region",
    "where nuclei are about to melt into uniform matter , it is expected that , at sufficiently low temperatures relevant to neutron star interiors @xcite , the energetically favorable configuration of the mixed phase possesses interesting spatial structures such as rodlike and slablike nuclei and rodlike and spherical bubbles , etc . , which are referred to as nuclear `` pasta '' @xcite .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by several approaches assuming nuclear shapes such as the liquid drop models @xcite and the thomas - fermi calculations @xcite , and is also confirmed without assuming nuclear shapes in the framework of the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite and of the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite .",

    "it is noted that , at temperatures of several mev , effects of thermal fluctuations on nucleon distribution would be quite significant at subnuclear densities .",
    "however , the mean - field approximation such as the thomas - fermi @xcite and hartree - fock @xcite approximation is not suitable to incorporate thermal fluctuations .",
    "finite temperature effects lead to evaporation of nucleons from nuclear liquid region and smoothed nucleon density profiles . at lower temperatures where each nuclei fluctuates a little around an average species",
    ", a compressible liquid - drop model @xcite with incorporating the temperature dependence of its bulk , surface , and coulomb+lattice components provides a useful way to investigate the pasta phases at finite temperatures . as for the bulk component @xcite , binding energy , saturation density , and incompressibility @xcite , which are parameters characterizing saturation properties , decrease with increasing temperature while the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy is not significant @xcite . for surface component , thermal broadening of the nucleon density profile reduces nuclear surface tension @xcite .",
    "lattice energy is also modified by translational motion of nuclei @xcite . however , at higher temperatures where the fluctuation of nuclear shape is significant , the above liquid - drop picture no longer holds ; we have to call on some _ ab - initio _ method which does not assume nuclear shape .",
    "more interestingly , it might be possible that , at these temperatures , the shape of the nuclear surface fluctuates and nuclei of various sizes and shapes coexist like colloid due to the entropy effect .",
    "these finite temperature effects can be well described by the methods of molecular dynamics ( md ) for nucleon many - body systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "qmd @xcite , which is one of them , enables us to treat much larger systems than the other methods of md do .",
    "furthermore , at temperatures of several mev , shell effects , which can not be incorporated by qmd , are less important because they washed away by thermal fluctuations above @xmath10 mev .",

    "pasta phases in supernova matter ( snm ) are expected to affect the neutrino transport and hydrodynamics in supernova cores .",
    "let us first note that the neutrino wavelengths , typically of order 20 fm , are comparable to or even greater than the internuclear spacing , leading to diffractive effects on the neutrino elastic scattering off such a periodic spatial structure of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these effects , induced by the internuclear coulombic correlations , would reduce the scattering rates and hence the lepton fraction @xmath11 . for the bcc lattice of spherical nuclei ,",
    "such a reduction was examined by horowitz @xcite by calculating the associated static structure factor .",
    "it is also noteworthy that nonspherical nuclei and bubbles are elongated in specific direction . in such direction ,",
    "the neutrino scattering processes are no longer coherent , in contrast to the case of roughly spherical nuclei whose finiteness in any direction yields constructive interference in the scattering , which leads to the neutrino - trapping @xcite .",
    "the final point to be mentioned is that the changes in the nuclear shape are accompanied by discontinuities in the adiabatic index , denoting how hard the equation of state of the material is .",
    "these discontinuities may influence the core hydrodynamics during the initial phase of the collapse @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the structure of hot dense matter at subnuclear densities within the framework of qmd .",
    "simulations of nuclear matter with proton fraction @xmath3 in addition to symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath1 ) are performed because the typical value of the proton fraction for supernova matter is around 0.3 due to the trapping of the electron neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we draw phase diagrams for @xmath1 and 0.3 in the density versus temperature plane , which show the qualitative feature of the finite temperature effects on the structure of nuclear matter .",
    "the results of the present study would be helpful to understand the real situation of the interior of the collapsing cores .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ formulation ] , we briefly explain the qmd model used in the present study and then discuss an effective temperature . in this section , a thermostatting method used in the simulations is also explained . in section [ results ] , we show snapshots of some typical nucleon distributions to discuss qualitative features of finite temperature effect . after that , we analyze the structure of matter using two - point correlation functions and minkowski functionals , and finally , resultant phase diagrams are shown .",

    "the regions above the dotted line and the dashed line correspond to some non - uniform phase , which is however difficult to be classified into specific phases because the nuclear surface can not be well identified .",
    "the most striking finite temperature effect on the phase diagrams is that the density of each phase boundary between the different structures decreases as @xmath13 increases .",

    "we have investigated the structure of hot nuclear matter at subnuclear densities by qmd simulations .",

    "this result strongly suggests that these phases with exotic nuclear structures can exist in the inner cores in the pre - bounce stage of the collapse - driven supernovae",

    "the qualitative features of the nucleon distribution at finite temperatures , except for higher densities just below which matter becomes uniform even at @xmath178 mev , may be summarized as follows .",
    "* at @xmath179 11.5 mev , the number of evaporated nucleons starts to be significant .",
    "however , the macroscopic structure of matter does not basically change from that of zero - temperature matter except for a small expansion of the nuclear matter regions . * at @xmath179 1.52.5 mev , fluctuations of the nuclear shape start to be significant and , in some cases , the topology of the nuclear structure changes from that in the zero - temperature matter for the same density .",
    "* at @xmath179 2.5  3 mev , single particle excitations are dominant rather than collective excitations , representing nuclear deformations .",
    "the density profile of nucleons is smoothed out , and nuclear surface can not be identified by a threshold density . at higher temperatures , even the density contrast becomes drastically smaller , which leads to the transition to uniform matter .",
    "the order of the transition from inhomogeneous matter to uniform matter has yet to be clarified . *",
    "the critical temperature @xmath180 for the phase separation is @xmath0 mev for @xmath1 and @xmath2 mev for @xmath3 .    through the present work and the previous ones @xcite , we have depicted the structure of nuclear matter in neutron star inner crusts and supernova inner cores in its equilibrium state .",
    "our studies will be helpful in understanding the realistic situations of the interior of the dense stars .",
    "for further work , studies on the dynamical aspects of the nuclear pasta become important .",
    "for example , in connection with the possible instability of the long - range order of the planar phase , which can not be fully incorporated in our simulations , elastic properties @xcite of the pasta and spongelike phases should be studied further .",
    "structural transitions between the pasta phases induced by compression and decompression is one of the most interesting problems @xcite which have not yet been studied at all .",
