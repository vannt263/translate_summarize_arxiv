    "[ hatano - sec10 ]    first of all , we discuss as to why we have to treat the exponential operator and why we need an approximant in order to treat the exponential operator .",
    "the exponential operator appears in various fields of physics as a formal solution of the differential equation of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a function or a vector and @xmath13 is an operator or a matrix .",
    "typical examples are the schrdinger equation @xmath14 ( we put @xmath15 here and hereafter ) , the hamilton equation @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hatano - eq160 ] ) below ) and the diffusion equation with a potential @xmath17 a solution of eq .",
    "( [ hatano - eq100 ] ) is given in the form of the green s function as @xmath18 although it is only a formal solution ; obtaining the green s function @xmath19 is just as difficult as solving the equation  ( [ hatano - eq100 ] ) in any other way .",
    "another important incident of the exponential operator is the partition function in equilibrium quantum statistical physics : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a quantum hamiltonian .    the exponential operator , however , is hard to compute in many interesting cases . the most straightforward way of computing the exponential operator  @xmath22 is to diagonalize the operator @xmath13 . in quantum many - body problems , however , the basis of the diagonalized representation is often nontrivial , because we are typically interested in the hamiltonian with two terms or more that are mutually non - commutative ; for example , the ising model in a transverse field , @xmath23 and the hubbard model , @xmath24 in the first example  ( [ hatano - eq130 ] ) , the quantization axis of the first term is the spin @xmath25 axis , while that of the second term is the spin @xmath1 axis .",
    "the two terms are therefore mutually non - commutative . in the second example  ( [ hatano - eq140 ] ) , the first term is diagonalizable in the momentum space , whereas the second term is diagonalizable in the coordinate space . in both examples ,",
    "each term is easily diagonalizable .",
    "since one quantization axis is different from the other , the diagonalization of the sum of the terms becomes suddenly difficult .",
    "the same situation arises in chaotic hamilton dynamics .",
    "consider a classical hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the kinetic term and @xmath28 is the potential term .",
    "the hamilton equation is expressed in the form @xmath29 where the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 are symbolic ones standing for the operations @xmath32 although each operation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is simple enough , the ",
    "hamiltonian \" operator @xmath33 is not easily tractable .",
    "this is because the kinetic part and the potential part , @xmath34 do not commute with each other ; see an example in sect .",
    "[ hatano - subsec20 ] below .    to summarize this section",
    ", we frequently encounter the situation where the exponential operator of each term , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , is easily obtained and yet the desired exponential operator @xmath37 is hard to come .",
    "this is the situation where the trotter decomposition  ( [ hatano - eq10 ] ) becomes useful .",
    "[ hatano - sec20 ]    we discussed in the previous section the importance of the exponential operator and the necessity of a way of treating it .",
    "we here discuss a remarkable advantage of the trotter approximant to the exponential operator .",
    "let us first confirm that the trotter approximant  ( [ hatano - eq10 ] ) is indeed a first - order approximant . by expanding the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ hatano - eq10 ] ) , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the identity operator .",
    "the difference between the two comes from the fact that in the approximant  ( [ hatano - eq210 ] ) , the operator @xmath2 always comes on the left of the operator @xmath3 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath40}+{\\mathop{\\mathrm{o}}}(x^3)}.\\ ] ]    in the actual application of the approximant , we divide the parameter @xmath1 into @xmath41 slices in the form @xmath42}+{\\mathop{\\mathrm{o}}}\\left(\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^3\\right ) } \\right]^n = { \\mathrm{e}}^{x(a+b)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{x^2}{n}{\\left [ a , b \\right]}+{\\mathop{\\mathrm{o}}}\\left(\\frac{x^3}{n^2}\\right)}.\\ ] ] thus the correction term vanishes in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to the integer @xmath41 as the trotter number .",
    "now we discuss as to why we should be interested in generalizing the trotter approximation .",
    "the trotter approximant  ( [ hatano - eq10 ] ) and the generalized one  ( [ hatano - eq30 ] ) , in fact , have a remarkable advantage over other approximants such as the frequently used one @xmath44 the approximant of the form  ( [ hatano - eq30 ] ) conserves an important symmetry of the system in problems of quantum dynamics and hamilton dynamics .    in problems of quantum dynamics , the exponential operator , or the green s function",
    "@xmath45 is a unitary operator ; hence the norm of the wave function does not change , which corresponds to the charge conservation .",
    "we here emphasize that the exponential product @xmath46 is also a unitary operator .",
    "the perturbational approximant  ( [ hatano - eq240 ] ) , on the other hand , does not conserve the norm of the wave function ; in fact , the norm typically increases monotonically as the time passes as we demonstrate in sect .",
    "[ hatano - subsec19 ] below .    in problems of hamilton dynamics ,",
    "the time evolution of the hamilton system conserves the volume in the phase space @xmath47 , which is called the symplecticity in mathematics .",
    "the exponential product formula , in general , also has the symplecticity .",
    "the time evolution of the hamilton equation  ( [ hatano - eq160 ] ) is described by the exponential operator @xmath48 where @xmath21 is the  hamiltonian \" operator  ( [ hatano - eq180 ] ) .",
    "the trotter decomposition approximates the time evolution with the operator @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "( [ hatano - eq190 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath52 describes the time evolution over the time slice @xmath53 of a hamilton system with only the kinetic energy @xmath54 .",
    "it thereby conserves the phase - space volume , so does the operator @xmath55 .",
    "the whole trotter approximant therefore conserves the phase - space volume .",
    "this holds for any exponential product formula in the form  ( [ hatano - eq30 ] ) as well .",
    "hence the exponential product formula , when used in the hamilton dynamics , is sometimes called a symplectic integrator .    in equilibrium quantum statistical physics",
    ", the operator @xmath56 does not have a particular symmetry except the symmetries of the hamiltonian itself .",
    "the above advantage of the exponential product formula is hence lost when applied to numerical calculations of the partition function @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , in applying the higher - order decomposition  ( [ hatano - eq30 ] ) to the world - line quantum monte carlo simulation , some of the parameters @xmath8 are negative , which causes the negative - sign problem in systems that usually do not have the negative - sign problem  @xcite .",
    "the negative - sign problem is the problem that the boltzmann weight of the system to be simulated becomes negative for some configurations .",
    "thanks to a recent development of the world - line quantum monte carlo simulation  @xcite , the higher - order decomposition is not necessary anymore in some cases ; the simulation is carried out in the limit @xmath43 from the very beginning and hence the order of the correction term does not matter in such cases .",
    "see appendix  [ hatano - app10 ] for a brief review over the recent development .",
    "the fact that the exponential product formula keeps the symmetry of the system is one of its remarkable advantages . in the present and next subsections ,",
    "we demonstrate that this indeed affects numerical accuracy strongly . in the present subsection",
    ", we use a simple example of quantum dynamics , namely the spin precession .    consider the simple hamiltonian @xmath58 if we start the dynamics from the up - spin state @xmath59 the spin precesses around the axis of the magnetic field @xmath60 with the period @xmath61    although it is easy to compute the dynamics exactly , we here use the trotter approximant @xmath62 and the perturbational approximant @xmath63",

    "( [ hatano - eq5010 ] ) with the energy expectation @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the error in the energy of the trotter approximation  ( [ hatano - eq5030 ] ) oscillates periodically and never increases beyond the oscillation amplitude . the period of the oscillation in fig .",
    "[ hatano - fig05](a ) is equal to that of the spin precession .",
    "we can understand this as follows : when the spin comes back to the original position after one cycle of the precession , it comes back accurately to the initial state  ( [ hatano - eq5010 ] ) because of the unitarity of the trotter approximation , and hence the oscillation .",
    "in contrast , the error in the energy monotonically grows in the case of the perturbational approximant as is shown in fig .",
    "[ hatano - fig05](b ) .",
    "this is because the norm of the wave vector increases by the factor @xmath68 the remarkable difference between fig .",
    "[ hatano - fig05](a ) and fig .",
    "[ hatano - fig05](b ) thus comes from the fact that the trotter approximant is unitary .",
