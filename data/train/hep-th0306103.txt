    "coupling the abelian higgs model with gravity , garfinkle @xcite showed that , as in flat spacetime , there exist static cylindrically symmetric solutions representing vortices .",

    "it was observed that these quantities present two contributions for each model of magnetic flux .",

    "the second contributions are corrections due to the finite thickness of the radius of the tube .",

    "specifically , for the third model this contribution is a long - range effect , i.e. , it is as relevant as the standard one up to a distance which exceed the radius of the observable universe .    in this paper",
    "we return to this problem and extend the above analysis to the charged massless fermionic fields . as we shall see , the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensors also present two distinct contributions . moreover",
    "due mainly to interaction of the spin degrees of freedom of the fermionic fields with the magnetic fluxes , the corrections due to the nonzero thickness of the radius of the tube are composed by two terms .",

    "so in this case , the geometric and magnetic interactions provide contributions .",
    "the relevant physical question is how important they are . in this paper , together with previous ones , by guimares and linet , linet himself and us , we try to answer that question .",
    "in our analysis we added an extra ingredient on this investigation not yet considered .    as we have already mentioned , considering a finite thickness for the magnetic flux , additional contributions to the vacuum averages are obtained .",
    "because there is no possibility to analysis these effects for a realistic gauge cosmic string , we consider idealized configurations to the magnetic field .",

    "before to provide some qualitative information about the second contributions of ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , we would like to make a few comments about our results : @xmath60 the first contributions to them depend only on the conicity parameter @xmath26 , and the fractional part of @xmath126 , denoted by @xmath27 , for the two first models . @xmath61 the second contributions , the corrections , vanish in the limit @xmath175 .",

    "so we leave for the next section this analysis .",
    "in this section we shall exhibit the quantitative behavior for corrections to the renormalized vev of the zero - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor for the system analysed , considering for the three models specific values of the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath20 .",
    "these behavior can only be provided by numerical analysis .    the numerical method adopted by us to develop this analysis was numerical routine of maple to evaluate integrals .",
    "our first general conclusion is about the contributions presented by each term in the corrections .",
    "although the integrals in the variable @xmath174 present contributions with opposite sign due to the coefficient @xmath178 and @xmath179 , they do not cancel each other .",
    "this fact is a consequence , mainly , to the preferential spatial direction dictated by the magnetic field on the spinor degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , although the total contributions to the renormalized vev of the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath180 , requires in principal an infinite sum of terms , in fact this is not really necessary .",
    "the sums are very well represented by a few terms only . expressing this quantity as @xmath181 where @xmath182 , in our graphs we exhibit only the function @xmath183 for the three models , considering @xmath184 running in the interval @xmath185 $ ] .",
    "we also compare these functions for the three models .",
    "although , we expect that this function goes to zero in the limit as @xmath186 , or @xmath187 , our numerical results are not hundred percent trustful for @xmath184 smaller than @xmath188 .",
    "in fact the behavior of the factors @xmath189 for the two first models and @xmath190 for the third one for small value of @xmath184 can be obtained by developing a series expansion in power of their argument .",

    "in this paper we have explicitly exhibited the spinor green functions associated with a left - handed charged spinor field on a cosmic string spacetime in the presence of external magnetic fluxes for three different configurations , all of them confined inside a long tube of radius @xmath2 . having these green functions , we calculated the formal expressions to the renormalized vev of the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath205 .",

    "so , from all our numerical analysis we conclude that considering a nonvanishing radial extension to the magnetic flux in the calculation of the vacuum polarization , very important contributions take place .",
    "in fact these contributions become more relevant than the standard ones .",
    "the main reason for this fact is because no matter how big is the magnitude of the magnetic flux , the standard contribution depends only on the fractional part of @xmath126 .",
    "although the models investigated here in fact do not correspond to the realistic configuration associated with a @xmath4gauge cosmic string , they provide some improvement in the calculation of vacuum polarization effects when compared with the ideal case ; moreover our results give some general informations .",
