    "graphene is an effectively two - dimensional ( 2d ) material consisting of a sheet of carbon atoms . @xcite in its pristine form , it exhibits many remarkable low - energy electronic transport properties , such as half - integer quantum hall effect @xcite and klein tunneling , @xcite due to the linear dispersion of the charge carriers near two inequivalent valleys around the charge neutrality point .",
    "however , disorder may dramatically alter both the electronic structure @xcite and transport properties @xcite of graphene .",
    "it is generally believed that both short - range @xcite and strong long - range @xcite disorder can lead to inter - valley scattering and anderson localization , while weak long - range disorder only gives rise to intra - valley scattering , which does not lead to backscattering and anderson localization @xcite .    due to its intrinsic low - dimensionality",
    ", graphene provides an ideal testbed of revisiting old ideas regarding anderson localization in low dimensions as well as discovering new ones .",
    "the most successful theory for anderson localization is one - parameter scaling @xcite , which predicts that all states in disordered one- and two - dimensional systems are localized at zero temperature if the system is sufficiently large , although exceptions can occur when the disorder is correlated @xcite or electron - electron interaction can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "however , recent works regarding localization in graphene have yielded results that conflict with one - parameter scaling , with some studies supporting the existence of mobility edges even in the presence of uncorrelated anderson disorder @xcite .",
    "very recent numerical results indicate the difficulty of associating data for the finite - size localization length with a single scaling curve @xcite as well as the discrepancy between results of the 2d localization length obtained from the finite - size scaling approach and the self - consistent theory of localization @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested that the conductivity at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) saturates to a constant value @xcite , or decays following a power - law rather than exponentially with increasing system size @xcite , in graphene with resonant scatterers such as vacancy defects .    since the typical length scales regarding localization properties in 2d systems are generally very large , efficient numerical methods are desirable .",
    "although the standard numerical method for studying quantum transport is the landauer - bttiker approach combined with the recursive green - function technique , using it for realistically sized truly 2d graphene systems is still beyond current computational ability , since the computational effort scales cubically with the width of the system .",
    "in contrast , the linear - scaling real - space kubo - greenwood ( rskg ) method @xcite is generally much more efficient and has been used to study electronic transport in realistically sized graphene with various kinds of disorder @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the actual computational effort depends on the energy resolution , the required statistical accuracy , and most crucially , the transport regime . exploring the localization properties",
    "generally requires a large simulation cell to eliminate possible finite - size effects and a long correlation time ( which can be thought as the evolution time of a wavepacket ) to actually reach the localized regime , which can be very time - consuming .",
    "recently , we have significantly accelerated the calculations by implementing @xcite this method on graphics processing units @xcite , and further developed methods for obtaining the localization properties of disordered systems .",
    "it has been established @xcite through comparisons with the standard landauer - bttiker approach that ( 1 ) the average propagating length of electrons can serve as a good definition of length before its saturation and ( 2 ) the saturated propagating length is directly proportional to the localization length defined in terms of the exponential decay of conductance in the strongly localized regime .",
    "armed with this efficient numerical method , we perform an extensive numerical study of anderson localization in graphene with short - range disorder , including anderson disorder and vacancies .",
    "we first calculate the localization lengths for various quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) systems using the rskg method .",
    "since most of the previous works @xcite have applied the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) @xcite ( or equivalently , the recursive green - function method , see ref . ) , we also present a comparison between these two methods .",
    "based on our computational data , we are able to compare the results against the one - parameter scaling theory of localization length @xcite and construct an analytical expression for the so far undetermined scaling function . our results are consistent with those of schreiber and ottomeier @xcite and lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but compared to these works , we have considered a more complete set of energy points and much wider systems .",
    "we will also discuss the finite - size effects for the scaling analyses of both localization length and conductivity and some ambiguities in determining the semiclassical conductivity in graphene with resonant disorder using the rskg method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : methods ] defines the physical models and introduces the tmm for the calculation of localization length and the rskg method for the calculation of localization length as well as other electronic and transport properties .",
    "we then study anderson localization of graphene with anderson disorder and vacancy - type disorder in sections [ section : anderson ] and [ section : vacancy ] , respectively .",
    "section [ section : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "for pristine graphene , we apply the widely used nearest - neighbor @xmath0 orbital tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hopping parameter . the uncorrelated anderson disorder is modeled by adding random on - site potentials uniformly distributed within an energy interval of @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 being a measure of the disorder strength .",
    "the more realistic vacancy disorder is modeled by randomly removing carbon atoms according to a prescribed defect concentration @xmath5 , which is defined to be the number of vacancies divided by the number of carbon atoms in the pristine system .",
    "we will consider the whole energy spectrum for the anderson model and thus take @xmath2 as the unit of energy , but only consider a small energy window for the vacancy model and take ev as the unit of energy and set @xmath6 ev .",
    "when calculating the q1d localization length , we will consider both zigzag and armchair graphene nanoribbons ( zgnrs and agnrs , correspondingly ) . to test the effect of the boundary conditions in the transverse direction ,",
    "we also consider armchair carbon nanotubes ( acnts ) with the transport direction along the zigzag edge and periodic boundary conditions also along the transverse direction .",
    "we use @xmath7 and @xmath8 to denote the number of dimer lines along the zigzag edge and the number of zigzag - shaped chains across the armchair edge , respectively .",
    "the total number of carbon atoms in the computational cell is then @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 defines the width of the system . for zgnrs and acnts ,",
    "we set @xmath10 to @xmath8 and obtain the actual width @xmath11 using @xmath12 . for agnrs , we set @xmath10 to @xmath7 and obtain the actual width using @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the carbon - carbon distance , being roughly 0.142 nm .",
    "we define the localization length @xmath15 of a q1d system with a fixed width @xmath11 to be the characteristic length of the exponential decay of typical conductance with the system length @xmath16 in the strongly localized regime @xcite : @xmath17 where the typical conductance @xmath18 is obtained from the ensemble average over individual realizations with fixed system size and disorder strength @xcite .    in the literature ,",
    "the most often used methods for computing @xmath15 are the recursive green - function method and the tmm , which are essentially equivalent @xcite . in ref . , we have suggested another method of finding @xmath15 using the rskg formalism , briefly explained below . in this work , we will further demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency by comparing it against the tmm .      in the tmm ,",
    "the wave function @xmath19 of the @xmath5th slice along the transport direction of the q1d geometry is calculated iteratively using the transfer matrix equation ( note that all the matrix or vector elements here are @xmath10-by-@xmath10 matrices ) as @xmath20 with the initial wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we only consider zgnrs and acnts ( both with the transport direction along the zigzag edge ) when using the tmm , where the matrix @xmath23 takes two alternative forms depending on whether @xmath5 is even or odd , as given in ref . .",
    "according to oseledec s theorem @xcite , with increasing @xmath24 , the eigenvalues of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , converge to fixed values @xmath27 , the @xmath28 being lyapunov exponents .",
    "the localization length is defined as the largest decaying length associated with the minimum lyapunov exponent @xcite : @xmath29 numerically , the minimum lyapunov exponent can be computed by combining gram - schmidt orthonormalization with the above transfer matrix multiplication . practically , only sparse matrix - vector multiplication is required and one does not need to perform gram - schmidt orthonormalization after each multiplication . usually , performing one gram - schmidt orthonormalization every ten multiplications keeps a good balance between speed and accuracy .",
    "the number of slices required for achieving a relative accuracy of @xmath30 is approximately @xcite @xmath31 . in this work",
    ", we set @xmath32 .      in the rskg method @xcite ,",
    "the zero - temperature dc electrical conductivity at energy @xmath33 and correlation time @xmath34 can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36}{\\omega}\\ ] ] is the electronic density of states with the spin degeneracy taken into account .",
    "note that the factors of 2 in the above two equations can cancel each other and are not presented in some works , but we prefer to keep them for clarity .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the hamiltonian and @xmath38 is the volume , or in our case , just the area of the graphene sheet , and @xmath39^{\\dagger } \\delta(e - h ) [ x , u(\\tau)]\\right ] } { \\textmd{tr}\\left[\\delta(e - h)\\right]}\\ ] ] is the mean square displacement .",

    "the so - called linear - scaling algorithm for calculating the latter ( the calculation of the former does not need the second technique below ) can be achieved by the following three techniques : ( 1 ) approximating the trace by using one or a few random vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45\\approx\\langle \\phi|a|\\phi\\rangle$ ] , @xmath46 being an arbitrary operator , ( 2 ) calculating the time - evolution of @xmath47|\\phi\\rangle$ ] iteratively using , e.g. , the chebyshev polynomial expansion , and ( 3 ) approximating the dirac delta function @xmath48 using a linear - scaling technique such as fourier transform , lanczos recursion , or kernel polynomial .",
    "the relative error caused by the random - vector approximation is proportional to @xcite @xmath49 , where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian size ( the total number of carbon atoms in our problems ) and @xmath50 is the number of independent random vectors used . in this work ,",
    "we have used a few to a few tens of random vectors for each simulated system , the specific number depending on the specific system , the required accuracy , and the specific quantities to be calculated . for the approximation of the dirac delta function ,",
    "we have used the kernel polynomial method @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution @xmath51 achieved using this method is inversely proportional to the number of chebyshev moments ( which is the order the chebyshev polynomial expansion ) @xmath52 used . for most of the calculations ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath52 to be 3000 , which corresponds to en energy resolution of a few mev . while this energy resolution is sufficiently high for graphene with anderson disorder , it is not neccesarily high enough to distinguish the resonant state at the cnp in graphene with vacancy defects from other states . in section [ section :",
    "resolution ] , we will disscuss the effect of energy resolution on the results for graphene with vacancy defects .",
    "details of the involved algorithms and the implementation on graphics processing units can be found in ref .",
    "[ ] .    as @xmath34 increases from zero , the running conductivity @xmath53 first increases linearly , indicting a ballistic behavior , and then gradually saturates to a fixed value , which can be interpreted as the semiclassical conductivity @xmath54 , and finally decreases until it becomes zero if localization takes place .",
    "in practice , especially when the disorder is strong , there may be no apparent plateau to which the running conductivity saturates , and @xmath54 is thus usually defined as the maximum of @xmath53 .",
    "while this is generally a reasonable definition , it can sometimes result in problems , as we will show in section [ section : vacancy_b ] . after obtaining @xmath54",
    ", one can calculate the elastic mean free path @xmath55 through the einstein relation for diffusive transport @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fermi velocity , which can be calculated from the velocity auto - correlation at zero correlation time @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the rskg method also depends crucially on a definition of propagating length @xmath58 in terms of @xmath59 . indeed ,",
    "in the original kubo - greenwood formalism , there is no definition of length and no connection between conductivity and conductance can be made .",
    "a definition of length is required for the study of mesoscopic transport properties .",
    "a natural definition would be @xmath60 , but a more precise relation has been established @xcite : @xmath61 the factor of 2 in this equation can be justified from different perspectives : ( 1 ) it results in @xcite the textbook formula @xcite for the ballistic conductance @xmath62 and ( 2 ) it results in a q1d conductance @xmath63 which is consistent with independent landauer - bttiker calculations in the localized regime @xcite .",
    "this definition of length is only valid up to about @xmath64 , after which the propagating length saturates to a fixed value proportional to the localization length @xcite : @xmath65 the meaning of the factor of @xmath66 in this equation is yet to be found , but this expression yields results in a good agreement with independent laudauer - bttiker calculations @xcite .",
    "although an infinite @xmath34 is indicated in the above equation , in practice , we only simulate up to a finite @xmath34 and then fit the mean square displacement data using a pad approximant of the form @xmath67 .",
    "we found that as long as the mean square displacement is almost converged , this simple pad approximant results in a very good fit to the data and the saturated mean square displacement can be extracted as @xmath68 .",
    "as in the case of the tmm , an error estimation of the calculated data is useful to evaluate the quality of the results . however , there seems to be no unique way to define the errors for @xmath69 calculated using the rskg method .",
    "we have estimated the error for @xmath69 as the mean of @xmath70 over @xmath34 , where @xmath71 is the fitted propagating length using the pad approximant .",
    "we will further validate this method by comparing with independent tmm calculations in section [ section : anderson_a ] and discuss the finite - size effect in this method caused by the finite simulation cell length in section [ section : vacancy_a ] .",
    "+     +    figure 1 shows the calculated localization lengths for q1d systems with different widths , energies , disorder strengths , edge types , and boundary conditions .",
    "the considered systems are ( a ) zgnrs with @xmath72 , ( b ) acnts with @xmath72 , ( c ) zgnrs with @xmath73 , and ( d ) agnrs with @xmath73 . in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , the open circles and small filled dots correspond to the results obtained by the tmm and the rskg method , respectively .",
    "the errors estimates for the rskg results are indicated by the shaded areas with bounding lines .",
    "the relative accuracy of the tmm results is set to @xmath74 , which would result in errors comparable to the corresponding marker size , and we thus omit the error bars for the tmm results for simplicity .",
    "both methods give practically the same results , but the rskg method is much more efficient for wider systems due to the use of linear scaling techniques and the intrinsic parallelism in energy of this method .",
    "the parallelism in energy means that obtaining the results for all the energy points does not require more computation time than obtaining the result for a single energy value .",
    "in contrast , the computation time for the tmm scales cubically with respect to the width of the system and there is no parallelism in energy .",
    "therefore , using the tmm , we have only calculated a limited number of energy points for @xmath75 and 256 and no points for @xmath76 . even under these conditions ,",
    "the computation times for these two methods are roughly equal , which demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the rskg method .",
    "we thus only used the rskg method for weaker disorder , as shown in figs .",

    "1(a ) corresponding to free ( hard wall ) boundary conditions ( zgnrs ) and fig .",
    "1(b ) to periodic boundary conditions ( acnts ) .",
    "we note that for acnts , the cnp behaves rather differently from the other points : it evolves from a local maximum for @xmath77 to a local minimum for @xmath78 .",

    "to avoid band gaps , only metallic agnrs are considered .",
    "we note that agnrs behave similarly as acnts , having a maximum of @xmath15 at the cnp when the width of the system is small .",
    "however , with increasing width , the differences between different boundary conditions and edge types become smaller , and one may expect that these differences become vanishingly small in the limit of wide systems .",
    "+    as our results indicate that the differences of localization lengths between different boundary conditions and edge types become smaller with increasing width , a natural question is whether the conventional one - parameter scaling theory of localization length applies to our simulation data .",
    "mackinnon and kramer @xcite have proposed the following scaling law for the q1d localization length : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the 2d localization length for a given @xmath4 and @xmath33 , and @xmath81 is an unknown function .",
    "the construction of the scaling function for graphene ( or honeycomb lattice ) has been considered by schreiber and ottomeier @xcite as early as in 1992 , although they only considered relatively strong disorder ( @xmath82 ) due to the limited computational power available at that time .",

    "on the other hand , they also noted that when @xmath92 ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 and the scaling function should behave as @xmath95 .",
