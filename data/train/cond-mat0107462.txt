    "a recent finding of the room - temperature tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect in double perovskites sr@xmath4femoo@xmath2 ( sfmo)@xcite and sr@xmath4fereo@xmath2 ( sfro)@xcite revives the study of @xmath15 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath20/@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) transition - metal oxide alloys @xmath23o@xmath2 ( @xmath3=ba , sr , ca ) .",
    "most of the alloys have been up to now found to take a rock - salt crystal structure , an ordered one of the alternate perovskite units @xmath24o@xmath25 and @xmath26o@xmath25 along three crystallographical axes.@xcite sfmo and sfro taking this structure are predicted by band calculations to be a hm,@xcite where energy bands of one spin channel ( up or down ) cross @xmath12 and are therefore metallic but those of the other spin channel are separated by an insulating gap .",
    "theoretically speaking , the conduction electrons are 100@xmath27 spin polarized , this effect generally related to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering of a ( sub)lattice , despite a possible inter - sublattice antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling in some cases . for the polycrystallic ceramics of sfmo and sfro , an applied magnetic field can control magnetic domain reorientation and tends to parallelize the magnetization directions of fm domains and therefore reduces the spin scattering of spin - polarized carriers at grain boundaries , giving rise to a significant decrease of the measured resistivity.@xcite such an effect was referred to as an interdomain / grain tmr .",
    "like the well - known hm - like colossal mr manganites,@xcite the tmr materials also have potential technological applications to magnetic memory and actuators .",
    "the mr materials with an interesting combination of electronic and magnetic properties are of current considerable interest also from the basic points of view .",
    "double exchange ( de)@xcite model has been widely employed to account for the fm metallicity of la@xmath28ca@xmath29mno@xmath25 and related compounds , in spite of its recent modification by taking into account a strong electron - phonon coupling arising from the jahn - teller splitting of the mn@xmath9 ions,@xcite and even an alternative @xmath30-@xmath31 exchange model as lately suggested for those o @xmath32-@xmath5 @xmath15 charge - transfer oxides.@xcite one de - like mechanism@xcite was suggested for sfmo [ sfro ] that a strong hybridization between the mo@xmath8 ( @xmath33 ) [ re@xmath8 ( @xmath34 ) ] and fe@xmath9 ( @xmath35 ) down - spin @xmath10 orbitals via a @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling leads to electron mobility being responsible for the hm behavior , and the itinerant down - spin carriers are antiferromagnetically polarized by the localized fe@xmath9 @xmath36=5/2 full up - spins and therefore mediate a fm coupling in the fe sublattice .",
    "alternatively , very late a new mechanism@xcite was proposed that if the fe sublattice has a fm ordering ( being so actually ) , a bonding - antibonding splitting due to the mo @xmath20 [ re @xmath21]/fe @xmath15 hybridization results in a shift up ( down ) of the mo @xmath20 [ re @xmath21 ] @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) bands located between the fe@xmath9 @xmath15 full - filled @xmath38 and empty @xmath39 bands , and therefore an electron transfer from mo [ re ] @xmath38 bands to @xmath39 ones .",
    "this energy gain causes a negative spin polarization of the formally nonmagnetic mo [ re ] species , and the itinerant electrons in the partly filled @xmath39 conduction bands cause kinetic energy gain further via the de interaction , both of which commonly stabilize the fm state , as compared with the afm or paramagnetic ( pm ) state .",
    "in contrast , it was argued in another late study@xcite that a direct re @xmath10-re @xmath10 interaction is the main cause for the metallic behavior of ba@xmath4fereo@xmath2 ( bfro ) , and a lattice distortion of ca@xmath4fereo@xmath2 ( cfro ) induced by the smaller - size ca species disrupts the re - re interaction and makes itself nonmetallic .",
    "while magnetization measurements show that the latter has a higher @xmath16 value than the former , which seems surprising when referring to their distinct conduction behaviors.@xcite    one of the aims of this work is to probe which mechanism , either the direct or the indirect re - re interaction is essentially responsible for the conduction behavior of bfro and sfro by means of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite calculations .",
    "the present results clearly show that the re - o - fe - o - re interaction rather than the direct re - re one takes the responsibility . and",
    "it is suggested , based on the calculated orbital - resolved density of states ( dos ) , that a reduced re @xmath10-fe @xmath10 @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization in distorted cfro partly accounts for its nonmetallic behavior , compared with the cases of cubic bfro and sfro . while a presence of a finite re @xmath14-fe @xmath14 @xmath6-@xmath13 hybridization in cfro at @xmath12 contributes to its increasing @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the electronic , magnetic , and transport properties of sr@xmath40moo@xmath2 ( @xmath5=cr , mn , fe , co ) on the @xmath15 transition - metal species is an intriguing issue.@xcite sfmo and sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 have a high @xmath16 value , and the former is a metallic compound while the latter is a nonmetal with a relatively low room - temperature resistivity.@xcite in contrast , sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 are afm insulators.@xcite for the reason , dft calculations are also designed for them .",
    "the valence states , spin moments , electronic and magnetic characters are discussed below in detail .",
    "the structure data of @xmath1fereo@xmath2 ( @xmath3=ba , sr , ca ) and sr@xmath40moo@xmath2 ( @xmath5=cr , mn , fe , co ) are taken from refs .",
    "11 , 2 and 8 .",
    "these compounds have a cubic crystal structure except for the tetragonal sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 and monoclinic cfro .",
    "an orthogonal cell is assumed for cfro in order to simplify calculations , since the experimentally determined monoclinic cell ( @xmath41=90.02 ) deviates slightly from an orthogonal one.@xcite fm calculations are performed for these compounds .",
    "as seen below , there is an induced negative spin polarization of the re or mo sublattice at the background of the fm fe and/or cr sublattices , which we call a fim structure in this paper .",
    "in addition , the present fm solutions of sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 can be extended to an explanation of their afm insulating behaviors .",
    "the full - potential linearly combined atomic - orbital ( lcao ) band method,@xcite based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda)@xcite to dft and on - site coulomb correlation correction ( lsda+@xmath0)@xcite , is adopted in the present calculations .",
    "hartree potential is expanded in terms of lattice harmonics up to @xmath42=6 , and an exchange - correlation potential of von barth - hedin type@xcite is adopted . the @xmath0 ( =3 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 ev ) parameters are used for the strongly correlated @xmath5 ( = cr , mn , fe , co ) @xmath15 electrons,@xcite respectively ; while a small @xmath0=1 ev for the weakly correlated re @xmath21 and mo @xmath20 electrons.@xcite ba @xmath43/sr @xmath44/ca @xmath45 , @xmath5 @xmath46 , re @xmath47/mo @xmath48 , and o @xmath49 orbitals are treated as valence states .",
    "125 ( 64 for cfro with a doubled cell ) special @xmath50 points in irreducible brillouin zone are used in the present self - consistent calculations .",
    "a description of the method for orbital population analyses is given below for the reason that a detailed discussion about the orbital occupation is made in the text .",
    "a crystal wave function @xmath51 is expressed in terms of bloch basis functions \\{@xmath52 } in the lcao formalism : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes an atomic orbital wave function .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 stand for , respectively , a wave vector , a band index , an atomic orbital label , number of unit cells , a lattice vector , and an atomic position .",
    "the total dos reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 refers to an overlap matrix , and @xmath63 represents the number of @xmath55-points .",
    "@xmath64 can be decomposed into an on - site term @xmath65 ( @xmath66=@xmath67 and @xmath60=@xmath68 ) and an overlap term @xmath69 ( @xmath66@xmath70@xmath67 or @xmath60@xmath70@xmath68 ) .",
    "the on - site term is written as @xmath71 due to the orthogonality and normality of atomic orbitals at the same site .",
    "correspondingly , the on - site occupation number @xmath72 @xmath73 is composed of atomic contributions \\{@xmath74}. obviously , the sum rule for total number of electrons is not satisfied due to the non - orthogonality of atomic orbitals at different sites . for the reason , the overlap term @xmath69 is dealt with by mulliken analysis@xcite which is widely used among quantum chemistry community and provides a reasonable description of local orbitals .",
    "the overlap term is expressed as @xmath75 mulliken analysis is taken such way that the overlap term is decomposed into atomiclike contributions @xmath76 , according to their respective ` weight ' @xmath74 .    as a result",
    ", one can calculate the orbital - resolved dos and population , respectively , by the expressions @xmath77 @xmath78 note that for a spin - polarized system , one can calculate the contributions from up- and down - spin channels and then obtain the values of spin moments .",
    "the lsda calculations for bfro and sfro give a nearly same hm solution as recently reported for the latter.@xcite their level distributions are overall very similar , as is not surprising since , on one hand , both compounds have the same cubic structure except for a difference in their lattice constants 8.05    versus 7.89   ; @xcite on the other hand , two ba@xmath17/sr@xmath17 ions per formula unit donate their four valence electrons , [ all @xmath3(=ba , sr , ca ) almost taking a valence state of + 1.8 and a minor spin moment of 0.01 @xmath79 in the present calculations ] , into ( fereo@xmath2)@xmath80 unit and scarcely affect the valence bond interactions both in and between the ( fereo@xmath2)@xmath80 units . owing to the lattice distortion of cfro  shrinked fe - o - re bond lengths and bent bond angles@xcite  and therefore modified @xmath6 hybridizations , however , a noticeable difference emerging in cfro is that the down - spin @xmath14 hybridized states are also present at @xmath12 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 that in @xmath1fereo@xmath2 ( @xmath3=ba , sr , ca ) , the up - spin fe @xmath15 orbitals are almost full - filled , while the down - spin fe @xmath15 ones are nearly empty except for a small amount of occupations due to @xmath19 hybridizations , both of which indicate that the formal fe@xmath9 ( @xmath35 ) ions actually take a mixing @xmath35+@xmath81 state ( @xmath42 : a ligand hole ) like an ordinary case , as also seen in table i. moreover , a small increase of fe @xmath15 population ( and a corresponding minor decrease of fe spin ) as the change of @xmath3 from ca via sr to ba , being qualitatively in accord with the mssbauer spectroscopy study,@xcite indicates a decreasing oxidization of fe , which is also supported by the calculated valence state of the coordinated oxygens , 1.47 for @xmath3=ca , 1.4 for @xmath3=sr , and 1.35 for @xmath3=ba . while a significantly strong @xmath19 hybridization effect is evident for the formal high valence re@xmath8 ions , which causes a larger bonding - antibonding splitting and a crystal - field @xmath10-@xmath14 splitting . as a result , although the down - spin re @xmath10 states crossing @xmath12 are partly occupied as the expected 2/3 filling , the @xmath21 orbital population is larger than 4 and far away from the formal re@xmath8 @xmath34 as seen in table i. a similar population difference larger than 2 also appears in the high valence oxides , @xmath82@xmath83 , v@xmath4o@xmath84@xcite and nav@xmath4o@xmath84.@xcite the relatively smaller re @xmath21 population in cfro , compared with sfro and bfro , is also related to the relatively higher negative valence of the coordinated oxygens .",
    "a stronger ionicity of cfro could be implied by a weaker fe - o - re covalence interaction caused by the bent fe - o - re bond angle .",
    "moreover , a little smaller re @xmath21 population in sfro than in bfro could be due to a more delocalized behavior of the down - spin re @xmath10 orbitals in sfro , which is closely related to a larger band width caused by the smaller cubic lattice constant of sfro .    as seen in fig .",
    "1 , the re @xmath10 levels exactly lie between the up- and down - spin fe @xmath10 ones , and they are close to the down - spin fe @xmath10 levels . as a result , the bonding - antibonding mechanism stated above induces a spin splitting of the re @xmath21 levels and a subsequent electron transfer and therefore a negative spin polarization .",
    "moreover , it is evident that a stronger re / fe bonding - antibonding interaction occurs in the down - spin channel than in the up - spin one .",
    "the present lsda calculations give the fe ( re ) spin moments of 3.72 ( 0.99 ) @xmath79 in bfro , and 3.75 ( 1.05 ) @xmath79 in sfro , and 3.76 ( 1.07 ) @xmath79 in cfro , all of which are reduced by the @xmath19 hybridizations , compared with the ideal 5 ( 2 ) @xmath79 for fe@xmath9 ( re@xmath8 ) .",
    "a stronger re @xmath21 spin polarization in sfro than in bfro could be due to a stronger bonding - antibonding mechanism in sfro caused by the shorter fe - o - re bond . while the calculated largest re spin in cfro is ascribed to both an additional negative spin polarization of the re @xmath14 electrons and weaker delocalization of the re @xmath21 electrons .",
    "the calculated total spin , including both the weakly polarized oxygen spins with an averaged value of 0.05 @xmath79 and the minor @xmath3 spin , is accurately equal to 3 @xmath79 per formula unit as an expected integral value for a hm . while the reduced experimental values , @xmath82@xmath85 . 2.7 @xmath79 in sr@xmath4fereo@xmath2,@xcite are probably ascribed to a site - disorder effect as previously suggested.@xcite the calculated fe spin moments agree well with the previous 3.7 @xmath79 in sfro,@xcite while the re spin moments are larger than the corresponding value of 0.78 @xmath79.@xcite although the previous values were calculated within relatively small radii ( @xmath82@xmath83 , muffin - tin spheres);@xcite while the present ones are calculated for the magnetic ions with extended orbitals , it is not surprising that the fe moments ( nearly 75@xmath27 spin - polarized ) are almost identical because of the strong localization of the fe @xmath15 orbitals . the present larger re moments ( about 50@xmath27 spin - polarized ) are ascribed to the delocalized re @xmath21 orbital behavior",
    ".    a high re - o ( and fe - o ) covalent charge density is evident in fig .",
    "2 . in addition",
    ", the up - spin fe charge density is nearly spherical , which corresponds to the formal full - filled up - spin fe@xmath9 @xmath15 orbital ; while the down - spin re ( and fe ) density is obviously of the @xmath10 orbital - like distribution .",
    "moreover , the re - re interstitial densities visually arising from the o @xmath32 contribution almost have no difference between the up- and down - spin channels , which indicates that the net down - spin re charge scarcely serves to the re - re interaction . in other word , the direct re - re interaction due to the itinerant down - spin re @xmath10 electrons is nearly impossible . furthermore , the charge densities in the re - o - fe bond are quite larger than the re - re interstitial densities . a combination of these results with the dos shown in fig .",
    "1 leads to a suggestion that the down - spin re @xmath10-o @xmath11-fe @xmath10 @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling rather than the direct re - re interaction is responsible for the fim and hm character of bfro and sfro .    in the calculated fim and hm state of cfro ,",
    "however , the down - spin fe @xmath10 component decreases at @xmath12 due to bent fe - o - re bond angles .",
    "the reduced fe - o - re @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling , as well as a little stronger site - disorder effect than in bfro,@xcite could partly account for the nonmetallicity of cfro . while a finite down - spin re @xmath14-o @xmath86-fe @xmath14 @xmath6-@xmath13 coupling emerges at @xmath12 in cfro , which is due to the @xmath10-@xmath14 mixing caused by the lattice distortion .",
    "the presence of such a coupling could stabilize the fim state of cfro and leads to its increasing @xmath16 as compared with bfro.@xcite however , the reasons for the nonmetallicity but high @xmath16 of cfro are not yet definitely clear .",
    "the @xmath0 correction lowers the occupied up - spin fe @xmath15 bands significantly and makes them much narrower and thus behave like a localized @xmath36=5/2 spin .",
    "the o @xmath32 states undergo a noticeable change , while the re @xmath21 bands change insignificantly due to a weak electron correlation .",
    "the present lsda+@xmath0 results of sfro are well comparable with those lately reported with a close value @xmath87=4 ev for fe.@xcite the hm character remains unchanged , and particularly , the dos at @xmath12 [ @xmath88 caused mostly by the down - spin re @xmath10-o @xmath32 hybridized states keeps the value of about 4 states / ev per formula unit ( nearly twice as large as that of sfmo@xcite ) as the above lsda result , since the re species are not strongly correlated ones .",
    "the lsda+@xmath0 calculations increase the fe ( re ) spin moments up to 4.16 ( 1.22 ) @xmath79 in bfro , 4.22 ( 1.27 ) @xmath79 in sfro , and 4.29 ( 1.33 ) @xmath79 in cfro .",
    "the increases of the fe spin moments are nearly twice as large as those of the re moments , due to a stronger localization and electron correlation of the fe ions .",
    "in addition , the increasing difference between the present and previous lsda+@xmath0 re spin moments is ascribed to the @xmath0=1 ev correction to the re @xmath21 states which is adopted in the present calculations but not in previous ones.@xcite    now we turn to sr@xmath4@xmath5moo@xmath2 ( @xmath5=cr , mn , fe , co ) . first , the lsda results of sfmo ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are in good agreement with the previous ones.@xcite like the above case of sfro , the present fe spin moment of 3.78 @xmath79 is almost identical with two independently calculated values of 3.79@xcite and 3.73 @xmath79,@xcite and the re spin moment of 0.44 @xmath79 is larger than two corresponding ones of 0.29@xcite and 0.30 @xmath79.@xcite these re moments are all less spin - polarized ( @xmath8945@xmath27 ) .",
    "these results suggest once again that the fe spin is strongly localized while the mo spin is delocalized . in sfmo",
    "the itinerant down - spin mo @xmath10 electrons mediate a fm coupling between the full fe up - spins and are responsible for its hm character via the mo - o - fe coupling , like the above cases of bfro and sfro . owing to the @xmath33 configuration of the formal mo@xmath8 ions , @xmath90",
    "( @xmath912 states / ev per formula unit being consistent with the previous results@xcite ) is reduced by nearly one half , compared with the above cases of bfro and sfro with re@xmath8 @xmath34 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "3 that besides a partial filling of the down - spin mo @xmath10 orbitals ( formally 1/3 occupied ) , there is a quite large amount of mo @xmath20 occupations between 8 and 4 ev due to strong @xmath19 covalence effects .",
    "the mo ions actually have a configuration nearly @xmath92 ( see table i ) .    for the case of sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 , owing to a shift up of the cr@xmath9 @xmath15 levels compared with the fe@xmath9 case of sfmo , the down - spin mo @xmath10-o @xmath93-fe @xmath10 coupling is reduced around @xmath12 , which could account for its decreasing @xmath16 and nonmetallic behavior@xcite ( the latter as discussed above for cfro ) . besides , the occupied up - spin cr@xmath9 @xmath10 levels are very close to @xmath12 and near the empty up - spin mo@xmath8 @xmath10 ones .",
    "thus the enhanced hybridization between them ( also due to the relatively short cr - o - mo bond ) leads to a broadened bandwidth , which makes the up - spin @xmath10 hybridized bands crossing @xmath12 also and partly occupied .",
    "the calculated cr ( mo ) spin moment is 1.67 ( 0.65 ) @xmath79 , and the total spin moment per formula unit is 1.13 @xmath79 , which is increased by the following @xmath0 correction up to the expected 2 @xmath79 for an ideal fim state . while an experimental magnetization value of @xmath910.5 @xmath79@xcite is much smaller than these theoretical ones .",
    "a significant site - disorder effect could account for this large discrepancy,@xcite since a minor difference between the ionic radii ( cr@xmath9 0.615   , mo@xmath8 0.61   ) @xcite most probably leads to a random structure.@xcite if a pair of antisite cr / mo ions leads to a decrease of spin moments by 6 @xmath79 , according to the analyses in ref .",
    "22 , the maximal antisite portion is estimated to be 25@xmath27 .",
    "note that the formal mo@xmath8 ions take @xmath94 in the lsda calculation .",
    "the mo spin is larger in sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 than in sfmo , reflecting a weaker itineracy of the mo @xmath10 electrons in the former,@xcite which qualitatively accords with its nonmetallic behavior and lower @xmath16 .",
    "for sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 , its lattice constant is larger than sfmo by @xmath910.12    and the mn - o bond is quite long,@xcite which indicates that the mn ion most probably takes a high - spin bivalence state ( mn@xmath17 , @xmath36=5/2 ) with a large ionic radius .",
    "another evidence to support this argument is that there is no jahn - teller lattice distortion in sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2@xcite as expected for the @xmath14 half - filled mn@xmath9 manganites .",
    "owing to the mo @xmath20-o",
    "@xmath32-mn @xmath15 hybridizations , however , the broadened up - spin mn @xmath14 bands cross @xmath12 and thus become partly occupied , and so do the down - spin mo@xmath18 @xmath10 bands , as shown by the present lsda fm calculation . for sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2",
    ", the lsda fm calculation gives a hm solution , which is caused by the 2/3 filled down - spin co@xmath17 @xmath10 orbitals mixed with the o @xmath11 and mo@xmath18 @xmath10 ones .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath95-axis co - o bond is a little elongated in tetragonal sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 by 0.045   , @xcite which lifts the triple - fold degeneracy of the co @xmath10 levels and splits them into a lower - energy doublet ( @xmath96/@xmath97 ) and a higher singlet ( @xmath98 ) . while only the weak distortion seen by the co @xmath10 electrons , as shown by the lsda calculation , is insufficient to open an insulating gap between the doublet and singlet .",
    "instead the electron correlation determines the gap as seen below .    by comparison of the down - spin mo @xmath10 level positions near @xmath12",
    ", it is suggested that mo takes mo@xmath8 in sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4femoo@xmath2 but mo@xmath18 in sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 .",
    "the mo@xmath18 state in the latter two is also implied by the shrinked mo - o bond length.@xcite while the finite mo component at @xmath12 in sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 is entirely ascribed to the @xmath6 hybridizations .",
    "as seen in table i , however , the mo @xmath20 population varies insignificantly in sr@xmath4@xmath5moo@xmath2 ( @xmath5=cr , mn , fe , co ) due to strong intrinsic @xmath19 covalency effects , and correspondingly , the @xmath5 @xmath15 population increases by a step of @xmath99 1 , suggesting nearly same valence states of all @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , sr and o retain the valence states of approximately + 1.8 and 1.4 respectively , for all @xmath5 .",
    "these results should be indicative of nearly a uniform valence state combination in sr@xmath4@xmath5moo@xmath2 .",
    "thus the present calculations support a previous suggestion@xcite that the @xmath5-independent spectral feature observed in sr@xmath4@xmath5moo@xmath2 at @xmath992 ev is ascribed to the o @xmath32-mo @xmath20 transition .",
    "in addition , the relative spectral intensity can be qualitatively explained in terms of the varying numbers of the empty mo @xmath10 states .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "3 that the down - spin mo @xmath10 orbitals at @xmath12 have nearly the same partial filling in sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4femoo@xmath2 , while they are almost unoccupied in sr@xmath4mnmoo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4comoo@xmath2 .",

    "the down - spin mo @xmath10 orbitals are rather weakly hybridized with the cr @xmath10 ones , and they form conduction bands crossing @xmath12 , which could be responsible for its relatively low room - temperature resistivity.@xcite the present calculations are not sufficient to reproduce the nonmetallic behavior of ca@xmath4fereo@xmath2 and sr@xmath4crmoo@xmath2 , and therefore a better description of their nonmetallicity could resort to the site - disorder effects in them .",
