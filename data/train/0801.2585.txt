    "an alternative is to use the reddening corrected ( u@xmath4b)@xmath14 and ( u@xmath4v)@xmath14 colors that correspond to the observed spectral types . doing that , we find distances of 452@xmath214  pc and 447@xmath33  pc respectively . since there is much more scatter in the observed u@xmath4b colors ( which we used to get the u@xmath4v colors ) than in the observed b@xmath4v colors , using the spectroscopic colors to estimate the cluster s distance may be more accurate .",

    "given the difficulties correcting for the reddening on the v , u@xmath4b and v , u@xmath4v cmds , we give more weight to the distance estimates we found using the spectroscopic colors .",
    "these distance estimates , combined with the distance estimates from the v , b@xmath4v cmd , indicate a best  fit distance of 444@xmath220  pc assuming solar metallicity .",
    "correcting for the lower metallicity of the cluster brings the distance estimate down to somewhere between 400  pc and 440  pc . at the most likely metallicity , the best ",
    "fit cluster distance is 420@xmath220  ( random)@xmath225  ( systematic )  pc or 420@xmath230  pc .",
    "as knowledge of the cluster s metallicity is refined , the best estimate of the distance modulus will shift and the systematic component of the uncertainty will be reduced .",
    "it is important to note that for the purposes of comparing the cluster to solar metallicity isochrones , the isochrone should be shifted to be @xmath70@xmath5.12 fainter to compensate for the lower luminosity of a sub  solar metallicity isochrone . for low  mass stars line",
    " blanketing will shift the isochrone by an additional amount that will depend upon the color index used on the cmd .",
    "the final line of table  [ dist_table ] lists the best `` average '' distance estimates for five assumed values for the cluster s metallicity .",
    "the assumed metallicities range from + 0.04 to @xmath40.27 .",
    "the uncertainties include only the random component of the uncertainty .",
    "an improved distance estimate for the @xmath0  ori cluster will impact the conclusions of previous research by varying degrees , depending upon what distance the authors assumed .",
    "the position of @xmath0  ori  c on figure  [ memb ] suggests a cluster age of @xmath72.5  myrs .",
    "this is consistent with the age of 23  myrs estimated from the low  mass stars by @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not correct for the small reddening , or the sub ",
    "solar metallicity of the cluster .",
    "an a@xmath21 of 0.19 would make the low  mass stars a bit brighter and therefore slightly younger .",
    "a sub  solar metallicity should make the low  mass stars bluer at a given spectral type .",
    "this would make the cluster s locus on the cmd fainter ( thus a bit older ) .",
    "the net effect on the estimated age is likely to be small , but without isochrones matched to the cluster s metallicity , the net effect is difficult to estimate .      @xcite compared the x  ray luminosity distribution function ( xldf ) of candidate low  mass members of the @xmath0  ori cluster to the xldfs of @xmath34  oph , the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , and the cha  i star forming regions .",
    "they found that the median 0.14  kev luminosity of k  type candidate members of the @xmath0  ori cluster is a factor of 3 to 5 fainter than that for the onc or cha  i , but comparable to that of @xmath34  oph .",
    "they also found that the median x  ray luminosity for @xmath0  ori cluster m  type candidate members is significantly lower than those of all three star forming regions .",
    "@xcite note that the discrepancy between the observed @xmath0  ori xldf and the onc or cha  i xldfs may be due in part to contamination of the membership list by field stars .",
    "they report that their sample includes 45 candidate @xmath0  ori cluster member that were selected from just photometric data and that were not detected with xmm .",
    "the discrepancy between the xldfs of the onc and cha  i and the xldf of the @xmath0  ori cluster is significantly reduced if most or all of these 45 candidate cluster members are assumed to be non - members .    @xcite assumed the hipparcos distance of 352  pc for @xmath0  ori . also , they used an xldf for the onc that assumed a distance of 470  pc @xcite .",
    "recent work shows that the onc is at a distance of 414@xmath27  pc @xcite . using our best fit distance of 420  pc and the new onc distance , the ratio of the median x",
    " ray luminosities would be larger by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "this , combined with the high probability that many of the 45 photometric candidate members that were not detected with xmm are non  members , may account for the apparent faintness of @xmath0  ori cluster members relative to the onc .",
    "since @xmath0  ori  b is observed to orbit @xmath0  ori  a @xcite , it is at the same distance as @xmath0  ori  aa and ab .",
    "yet , @xmath0  ori  b is consistently @xmath70.@xmath56 brighter than the zams which fits all of the other high  mass cluster members .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0  ori  b is a close binary just as @xmath0  ori  a is .",
    "alternatively , our assumed colors could be slightly wrong .",
    "if @xmath0  ori  b is a bit hotter and bluer than expected for a b0.5v star , it would be more consistent with the best fit zams . a sufficiently blue value of ( b@xmath4v)@xmath14 would be within 1@xmath0 of the standard color of a b0.5v",
    ". however , sufficiently blue ( u@xmath4b)@xmath14 or ( u@xmath4v)@xmath14 colors would be difficult to reconcile with the observed b0.5v spectral type .",
    "we feel that a close binary companion is the more likely explaination .",
    "from figure  [ true_cmd ] it is clear that the @xmath0  ori cluster must be more distant than the nominal 350  pc hipparcos distance for @xmath0  ori .",
    "we estimate a distance of 420@xmath230  pc for the cluster , assuming an [ fe / h ] of @xmath40.16 , or 444  pc assuming solar metallicity .",
    "this is consistent with , but significantly more precise ( 7% ) than the hipparcos distance ( 30% ) .",
    "our distance estimate is consistent with the estimated distance to orion ob1b .",
    "most of the older age estimates for the cluster assumed a distance of 350  pc .",
    "our more tightly constrained distance shows that the cluster age must be closer to the young end of the range of the estimated ages .",
    "this places the age of the cluster in the range of 23  myrs .",
    "sixteen of the 19 stars in our sample are probable members of the @xmath0  ori cluster .",
    "hd  37564 is too bright to be a cluster member .",
    "hd  294279 is too faint to be a cluster member .",
    "if hd  37333 is in fact an equal mass binary , it is likely to be a cluster member .",
    "the existence of a tight main sequence among the o , b , and a stars of the @xmath0  ori cluster suggests that any other clusters within the orion ob1a and orion ob1b groups ( such as the 25  ori cluster @xcite ) should also have tight main sequences .",
