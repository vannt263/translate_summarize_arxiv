    "cosmological simulations predict that most of the `` missing baryons '' ( 30 - 50% ) reside in low - density plasma in large - scale filamentary structures between galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "first reported highly significant detections of two absorption systems along the mkn  421 sight line using a deep _ chandra _  observation . but @xcite showed that the statistical significance of the lines reported by @xcite was greatly overestimated because the redshifts of the absorbers were not known _ a priori_. furthermore , a deeper _ xmm _  observation of mkn  421 did not confirm the presence of the claimed absorption systems @xcite .    to address these issues , we consider a different observational approach proposed by @xcite and pioneered by @xcite in their absorption study of the virgo cluster . rather than performing a so - called `` blind '' search for previously unknown intervening whim structures in front of the brightest background agn",

    "however , below in  [ lines ] we also assess the statistical significance of the absorption lines using simulated spectra , for which we prefer to use model representations of both the source and background spectra for each satellite .",
    "we constructed models of the background spectra as follows .",
    "the _ chandra _  letg - hrc - s background spectrum over @xmath42    is fairly well described by a broken power - law folded through only the instrument rmf ( `` redistribution matrix file '' ) and not the arf ( `` auxiliary response file '' ) .",

    "rgs1 the broad - band spectrum is not well described by simple models .",

    "the line near @xmath54    is fully consistent with hot gas from the milky way ( or local group whim ) , with the inferred error range on the redshift being consistent with zero .",
    "the redshift range of the line near @xmath55    matches very well the range of structure in the sculptor wall ( @xmath56 ) that intercepts the blazar s line - of - sight .",
    "henceforth , we refer to these candidate lines as the galactic and sculptor whim lines .",
    "the change in the fit statistic , whether it be the c - statistic or @xmath13 , is very similar when adding the galactic and sculptor whim lines , indicating that the statistical significance of the lines is also similar . for reference ,",
    "the change in the @xmath13 statistic observed when adding the sculptor whim line to the fit suggests the line is significant at the @xmath57 level when interpreted in terms of the f - test .",
    "however , the f - test is not strictly applicable to spectral line detection @xcite .    to obtain a rigorous estimate of the statistical significance of the sculptor whim line we employed a monte carlo procedure .",
    "using as a reference the best - fitting spectral model excluding the sculptor whim line , we generated with xspec  synthetic _ xmm _  and _ chandra _  spectra for the source and background (  [ bkg ] ) with the same exposure times as the real data .",
    "the simulations were performed using the full energy resolution of the response matrices , after which the synthetic spectra were re - grouped as described in  [ obs ] .",
    "in this way the simulations account for noise associated with the re - binning procedure .",
    "we fitted the synthetic background - subtracted spectra with the reference model and minimized the c - statistic to obtain a best fit .",
    "then we added a second absorption line component _ with redshift range restricted to 0.028 - 0.032 _ appropriate for the sculptor wall . after obtaining the new best fit , we recorded the reduction in the c - statistic .",
    "we performed this procedure for @xmath58 simulations .",
    "the probability of a false detection is given by the number of simulations where the reduction in the c - statistic is at least as large as observed in the real fit relative to the total number of simulations .",
    "the fit of the reference model ( i.e. , without the sculptor whim line ) to the real data yields a best - fitting value of the c - statistic of 68.2 for a total of 88 spectral bins . upon adding the sculptor line and re - fitting , we obtain a c - statistic of 58.6 for a reduction of 9.6 . for the monte carlo procedure described above",
    ", we find that in only 36 out of the @xmath58 simulations is the c - statistic reduced by at least 9.6 .",
    "this translates to a false detection probability of 0.36% .",
    "therefore , the statistical significance of the sculptor whim line is 99.64% ; i.e. , about @xmath0 .",
    "following the same procedure , but this time starting without the milky way line and with the sculptor whim line already in place , we determine the statistical significance of the milky way line to be 99.69% , also about @xmath0 .",
    "( we mention that the _ xmm _  data contribute more to the statistical significance than do the _",
    "if the spectral fitting is performed separately for each data set , then following the above monte carlo procedure for the sculptor whim line we obtain a statistical significance of @xmath59 for _ xmm _  and @xmath60 for _ chandra_. )    apart from the redshift noted above , the line parameters are not well constrained by the data . in table",
    "[ data ] we list the 90% confidence lower limits obtained for the k@xmath1 column density ( n ) and line - center optical depth @xmath61 .",
    "we quote results for two values of the @xmath27-parameter @xmath62  km  s@xmath9 which span a large range of whim temperature and turbulent pressure .",
    "the lower limits of @xmath63 for both lines demonstrate that the line centers are not optically thin .",
    "therefore , one can not infer the column density from the equivalent width independent of the @xmath27-parameter ; i.e. , these lines do not lie on the linear portion of the curve of growth .",
    "for reference , the best - fitting equivalent widths are nearly 30  m  for both the galactic and sculptor lines .    the column density lower limits of @xmath64  @xmath3 are consistent with expectations for both lines .",
    "similar column densities previously have been reported for the milky way ( or local group whim ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as for the sculptor line , we re - examined the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of @xcite and identified five super - structures with similar ( or higher ) galaxy over - density relative to the sculptor wall . by shooting random sight - lines through these super - structures we obtain a mean column density of @xmath65  @xmath3 , consistent with the limits imposed by our spectral fits on the sculptor wall .",
    "the large statistical errors obtained for the line column densities and line - center optical depths dominate systematic errors associated with our data analysis and modeling choices , and therefore we do not provide a detailed systematic error budget for the line parameters .",
    "however , in this section we briefly discuss the possible impact of systematic errors on the estimation of the significance of the sculptor wall whim line , which is the principal result of our paper .",
    "we have in particular considered the effects of errors in the background models and the wavelength calibration of the detectors , and we have also examined using @xmath13 rather than the c - statistic .    as we mentioned in ",
    "[ bkg ] , the background level is only a small fraction of the total observed flux for the _ xmm _  rgs .",
    "consequently , it is expected that small variations in the background level from that we adopted in our fits should have little effect on the significance estimate .",
    "indeed , varying the background level by @xmath66 , which reflects the statistical error on the power - law model obtained for the rgs background , did not have a noticeable effect .    because the _ chandra _  letg - hrc - s is unable to separate spectra of different orders , we examined how much our results change if instead we used a response matrix containing only information on the first - order spectrum . using only the first - order response leads to an underestimation of the actual background by almost 20% over the @xmath36    range .",
    "since the first - order response does not require a valid continuum model outside our range of interest , we allowed the slope of the continuum to be fitted without restriction over @xmath36   , which provides a measure of the sensitivity of the results to the definition of the continuum .",
    "when performing simultaneous rgs - letg fits using the first - order response for the letg we obtain a statistical significance of the sculptor whim line of @xmath67 , only slightly less than obtained when using the more accurate response containing orders 1 through 6 .",
    "we also considered systematic uncertainties in the wavelength calibration of the detectors .",
    "current estimates indicate the calibrations are accurate to within 2.4  m  in the rgs1 and to 10  m  in the letg / hrc - s .",
    "we find little difference in any of our results when allowing for shifts of these magnitudes between the detectors .",
    "we do mention that if the wavelength of the @xmath11 line is allowed to be fitted separately for the rgs1 and the letg then the best - fitting line centers are offset by 48  m .",
    "however , the shift is significant only at the @xmath68 confidence level , and it is substantially larger than the expected calibration uncertainty , indicating this marginal shift is probably noise .",
    "therefore , we kept the line energies tied between the detectors .",
    "finally , we also performed all of our fits by minimizing ( data - weighted ) @xmath13 and obtained a consistent result for the significance of the sculptor line as obtained using the c - statistic .",
    "in particular , the statistical significance of the sculptor line obtained using @xmath13 is , 99.81% , about @xmath0 .",
    "we report a detection at the @xmath0 level of an k@xmath1 resonance absorption line located in the sculptor wall super - structure of galaxies . the column density ( @xmath69  @xmath3 ) of the line , though not precisely constrained , is consistent with that produced by similar structures generated in cosmological simulations .",
    "the presence of this absorption line is inferred from simultaneous analysis of _ xmm _",
    "rgs1 and _ chandra_letg / hrc - s spectra of the blazar h  2356 - 309 @xmath70 . since the line center is saturated ( for both the sculptor and local lines )",
    ", we interpreted the spectra with a physical model where the line is modified by the voigt profile to account for both natural and doppler broadening .    the robustness of the detection benefits from three key aspects of our study .",
    "first , a critical factor in obtaining this high detection significance level is that we know _ a priori _ the redshift of the intervening structure in the sculptor wall ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the importance of this point was dramatized in the controversy over the claimed whim detection in the spectrum of mrk  421 @xcite .",
    "second , the line is detected from a joint analysis of _ xmm _  and _ chandra _  data .",
    "the consistent picture from the two satellites provides important reassurance given again the controversy for mrk  421 where the rgs did not confirm the claimed _ chandra _  detection @xcite .",
    "third , since the background source is a blazar , it is very unlikely that features intrinsic to the source contaminate our study of the foreground whim .",
    "this detection of whim in the sculptor wall represents the most significant ( non - local ) whim detection to date from x - ray absorption studies , providing vital evidence for the expected repository of the `` missing baryons '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
