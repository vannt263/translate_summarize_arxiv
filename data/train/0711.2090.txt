    "physical structures of an accretion disk are determined by various physical factors such as gravity of the central star , turbulence , magnetic fields . understanding the time evolution of dust particles in circumstellar disc - like structures around protostars and young stellar objects is crucial for explaining the formation of planetary systems . due to various complex physical processes that are playing significant roles in dust and gas discs , it is difficult to present a complete and self - consistent model for such systems . because of the gas drag force",
    ", the motion of the dust particles is different from that of gas ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "the gas drag force takes angular momentum from particles , resulting in their inward migration ( whipple 1972 ) .",
    "garaud , barri@xmath0re - fouchet & lin ( 2004 ) found that small particles move smoothly to the midplane , while large bodies oscillate about the midplane with decreasing amplitude .",
    "takeuchi & lin ( 2002 ) ( here after tl ) studied grains motion in optically thick disc , using the assumption that radiation pressure on the dust is negligible .",
    "they showed that as the gas accretion proceeds , small dust particles are left behind in the disc , and the dust to gas ratio increases . in a subsequent paper",
    ", takeuchi & lin ( 2003 ) investigated the outflow of dust particles on the surface layers of optically thick discs .",
    "klahr & lin ( 2001 ) studied the motion of grains in optically thin disc , where the dust experiences both gas drag and radiation pressure . in a similar analysis ,",
    "takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) suggested that ring - like features which have been observed in some circumstellar debris discs ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "1999 ; marsh et al .",
    "2005 ) , arise naturally in discs passing through the transitional phase from gas - dominated to dust - dominated discs .",
    "the dust particles migrate radially until they are in co - rotation with the gas .    to our knowledge , most of the previous studies are assuming that the motion of particles in the gas and dust accretion discs exclusively caused by gravitation , gas drag force and radiation pressure of the central protostar . however , collisional dust grain electrification in the early solar nebula has long been discussed to be a cause for lightning , which could explain the melting of meteoritic chondrule precursors .",
    "poppe , blum @xmath1 henning ( 2000 ) studied collisional grain charging experimentally .",
    "they showed that collisional grain charging is stronger than previously discussed with respect to preplanetary grains and should be considered concerning the preplanetary dust aggregation and the formation of lightning in the solar nebula .",
    "it also has influences on other physical conditions in gas and dust discs , because charged particles can interact with the magnetic field .",
    "although the strength and direction of magnetic fields in accretion discs are rather unknown , the observation of winds and outflows is explained by magnetic acceleration mechanisms that require the existence of a magnetic field with strength of @xmath2 t at 1 au solar distance ( k@xmath3nigl @xmath1 ruden 1993 ) .",
    "the possible effects of magnetic fields on the structure of accretion discs have been studied both numerically or analytically using simplified models ( e.g. lovelace , romanova & newman 1994 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2000 ; igumenshchev , narayan & abramowicz 2003 ) .",
    "these studies , generally show that magnetic fields may have significant effects on the structure of the discs .",
    "so , in gas and dust discs , one may expect such type of behaviors due to the magnetic fields .",
    "however , the ionization structure of protoplanetary discs which determines the coupling between the magnetic field and the grains is likely to be inhomogeneous and complex .",
    "the ionization fraction at different locations , and even different times , are not easy to calculate ( e.g. ilgner & nelson 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , the idea of a magnetically dead - zone was first proposed by gammie ( 1996 ) .",
    "he argued that there is a poorly ionized region where the growth of magnetorotational instability against ohmic dissipation can not be sustained .",
    "the dead zone typically stretching out to around 10 au to 15 au ( e.g. reyes - ruiz 2001 ; matsumura & pudritz 2006 ) .",
    "wardle ( 2007 ) studied the ionization equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disc midplane at radii 1 and 5 au .",
    "he showed that the dead zone may not extend over the entire vertical dimension of the disc , because not only the ionization fraction but the gas density are strong functions of height above the midplane and so the magnetic coupling is likely to increase away from the midplane .",
    "moreover , the ionization fraction itself is a strong function of the presence ( and size ) of the dust particles mixed with the gas and recent calculations have shown that once the grains have settled , the ionisation level is sufficient to couple the magnetic field to the gas at 1 au , even at the midplane ( wardle 2007 ) .",
    "but the disc becomes magnetically active beyond the dead zone ( e.g. reyes - ruiz 2001 ) . in this study",
    ", we are applying a simplified and phenomenological model for describing the gas component of a gas and dust disc for regions beyond the dead zone .",
    "we are assuming only the dust particles which are influenced by an imposed magnetic field .",
    "the properties of any external magnetic fields threading a dust and gas disc are not well - known . however , it is very unlikely that the dipolar field of the central protostar is important at several au from the protostar where the planets are believed to form .",
    "more probably such an external field comes from the the molecular cloud core out of which the gas and dust disc formed .",
    "these considerations show that magnetic forces on micron - sized particles in gas and dust disks will be worth further investigation .",
    "in fact , the structure of magnetic fields within protostellar discs may be studied via polarimetry provided that grains are aligned in respect to magnetic field within the discs . in this study",
    ", we assume that the charged particles are collisionless and indestructible spheres in a gaseous disc and , to keep the problem tractable , we also neglect the feedback of the particles drag on the motion of the gas .",
    "we mainly follow the approach of tl in analyzing the dynamics of grains , but in an imposed magnetic field .",
    "we show that a vertical imposed magnetic field affects the radial and the vertical motions of charged dust particles .",
    "the basic equations of the model are described in section 2 . in sections 3",
    "we solve for individual particles velocities , which are charged and small with sizes smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we study the motion of a dust particle with mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 in a magnetized gas disc .",
    "one can simply show that the collisional timescale is longer than the stopping time by at least an order of magnitude ( youdin & shu 2002 ) .",
    "so , we can ignore the effect of collisions .",
    "for a charged dust particle , newton s second law can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius vector of the particle .",
    "also , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the gravitational force of the central star , the gas drag , the magnetic force and the electric force , respectively .",
    "we neglect radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag for simplicity .",
    "it is more convenient to write the equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 .    as for the magnetic field geometry",
    ", we consider the toroidal and the vertical components of the magnetic field .",
    "if a charged grain is placed in a rotating frame , it will invariably feel an electric field .",
    "the keplerian velocity is denoted by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the central star .",
    "we can imagine one of two approaches : ( a ) either state that the equation is written in a frame where electric field is zero , i.e. @xmath15 in which case lorentz force term will become @xmath16 ; or ( b ) explicitly include an electric field term .",
    "we follow the first approach . in highly conducting plasma the electric field in the frame",
    "co - moving with the neutrals vanishes , so that the current density remains finite .",
    "but if we include the evolution of the magnetic field via the induction equation , this is not a good approximation in the presence of the charged dust grains . because charged dust particles can easily decouple from the field lines . in order to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "the magnetic field is treated as an imposed constraint in this study .",
    "now we can write the radial and the azimuthal equations of motion , @xmath17 @xmath18,\\label{eq : main1}\\ ] ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nondimensional stopping time . also , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components of the velocity of the dust particle , i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the rotational velocity of the gas component .    in order to write the @xmath28component of the equation of motion",
    ", we assume the particles reach terminal velocity , at which the gravity , the gas drag and the lorentz force balance with each other , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the nondimensional stopping time @xmath20 can the be written as ( tl ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the @xmath33 times the mean thermal velocity @xmath34 of the gas . also , @xmath35 g @xmath36 is the grain bulk density and @xmath37 is the gas density . in writing the above relation a spherical shape with radius @xmath38",
    "is assumed for the grain .",
    "we now specify our ansatz for the magnetic field .",
    "the vertical component of the field is assumed to take a form @xmath39 where @xmath40 au @xmath41 cm and @xmath42 t is the strength of the field at this radius .",
    "the normalization for the distance occurs relative to 1 au .",
    "we will also consider more general values of @xmath43 in order to explore the input parameter space .",
    "such a power - law relation for the vertical component of the magnetic field has been studied theoretically in self - similar models ( e.g. , shadmehri & khajenabi 2006 ; wu & lou 2006 ) .",
    "for example , a distributed @xmath44 field with @xmath45 has been suggested by blandford & payne ( 1982 ) .",
    "the paraboloidal field model of blandford ( 1976 ) corresponds to @xmath46 , and the models discussed by ostriker ( 1997 ) corresponds to the range @xmath47 . also , the toroidal component of the magnetic field is ( lovelace , romanova & newman 1994 ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is constant of order unity ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the other physical variables of the gas component are @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 where the power - law indices @xmath55 and @xmath5 are generally negative . also , the radial and the rotational velocities of the gas are @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is coefficient for the turbulent viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and @xmath60 is written as @xmath61    for the overall disc properties , it is often sufficient to work with a disc model in which dust and gas are well mixed and coupled . in our analysis",
    ", we adopt the values correspond to a minimum - mass solar nebula : @xmath62 , @xmath63 g @xmath64 , @xmath65 au , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "having these values the gas mass inside @xmath69 au is @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "we can obtain approximate analytical solutions for the equations of the motion by applying some simplifying assumptions . from equations ( [ eq : main3 ] ) and ( [ eq : btheta ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 z,\\label{eq : vz1}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is , in fact , the _ larmor frequency _ which is defined for describing the motion of a collection of moving charged particles in a region of constant magnetic field .",
    "we assume that rotational profiles of the gas and the dust components are close to keplerian , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 .",
    "now , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : main2 ] ) as @xmath76.\\ ] ] in equation ( [ eq : main1 ] ) , we can neglect the left hand side of the equation if @xmath77 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : main1 ] ) can be written as @xmath78 @xmath79 = 0.\\ ] ] substituting from equation ( [ eq : vz1 ] ) for @xmath80 into the above equation , an algebraic equation for @xmath81 is obtained and so , @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84    we can study profile of the radial velocity of dust particles using equation ( [ eq : vr ] ) .",
    "if we substitute this relation into equation ( [ eq : vz1 ] ) , an analytical solution is obtained for the vertical velocity of the dust particles . actually , for neutral dust particles , both parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 become one and our analytical equations ( [ eq : vz1 ] ) and ( [ eq : vr ] ) reduce to the solutions of tl .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on charged particles appears through larmor frequency @xmath87 and the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "however , in our proposed geometry of the magnetic field , we have an order of unity value for @xmath50 .",
    "so , dependence of the solutions on this parameter is weak and in our subsequent analysis we assume @xmath88 .",
    "but the larmor frequency @xmath87 not only depends on the magnetic strength @xmath89 , but mass and the electrical charge of a dust particle are important .",
    "we consider micron - sized grains where the nondimensional stopping time is much smaller than unity through most of the disc .",
    "such small particles are well coupled to the gas component .",
    "poppe , blum & henning ( 2000 ) demonstrated experimentally that a micron - sized grains may acquire 100 elementary charge .",
    "however , in cold protoplanetary discs , grains are either neutral or have 1 to 2 electronic charges .",
    "it is very unlikely planetary disc model where grains can carry 100 charges near the mid - plane . it may be possible in the hot hii regions where temperature is very high , but in our analysis we consider 1 electrical charge",
    "however , this situation changes significantly as we consider higher vertical locations .",
    "for example , for @xmath90 au , the mean grain charge is @xmath91 above @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( wardle 2007 ) . at larger radii",
    ", this transition may occur even closer to the midplane , given the drop in fluid density away from the central object . since our solutions reach to @xmath94 , it is plausible that at those locations the typical grain carries more than a single charge .",
    "we are interested in regions of the disc where magnetically are active .",
    "as we discussed such regions must be beyond dead region which may extend up to @xmath95 au .",
    "although we consider the radial distance @xmath96 au in our figures as starting radius of active region , we may simply consider larger radial distances in our analytical solutions .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows radial velocity @xmath81 versus vertical distance @xmath97 from the midplane of the disc for different dust sizes ( top plot ) and various exponent @xmath43 of the magnetic field ( bottom plot ) . in both plots the electrical charge of a dust particle",
    "is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is magnitude of the charge of the electron . in the top plot of figure [ fig:1 ]",
    ", we fix the exponent @xmath100 . also , solid curves correspond to the magnetic solutions and the dashed curves represent nonmagnetic solutions . for a particle with radius @xmath101 @xmath102 m",
    ", the difference between magnetic and the nonmagnetic solutions is negligible .",
    "also , as the radius increases , the effect of the magnetic field becomes weaker so that for a particle with radius @xmath96 @xmath102 m , magnetic and nonmagnetic solutions are indistinguishable .",
    "but for particles with radii smaller than @xmath101 @xmath102 m , the radial profile of the nonmagnetic solution is represented by a dashed curve which is actually radial profile of the gas component as well .",
    "for such small particles , magnetic forces significantly modify profile of the radial velocity .",
    "in fact , the radial velocity of charged particles increases and as a particle becomes smaller , the radial velocity increases too .",
    "note to the minus sign of the radial velocity .",
    "in other words , the radial migration of charged dust particles with radii smaller than critical @xmath103 @xmath102 m significantly increases due to the magnetic force .",
    "bottom plot of figure [ fig:1 ] shows radial velocity of a particle with radius @xmath104 @xmath102 m for various exponent @xmath43 .",
    "the radial profile highly depends on the radial profile of the magnetic field . as the exponent @xmath43 decreases , the radial migration of a charged grain increases .",
    "it implies that the critical radius @xmath105 depends on the exponent @xmath43 as well .",
    "while for @xmath100 the critical radius @xmath105 is around 1 @xmath102 m , as the exponent @xmath43 decreases , the critical radius increases which means particles with larger radii are affected by the magnetic force .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the effect of the electrical charge polarity on the radial velocity of the dust grains .",
    "solid curves correspond to a positively charged grain with one elementary charge and the dashed curves are for a negatively charged grain . in this plot",
    ", the magnetic exponent is @xmath100 .",
    "although for grains with radii larger than @xmath105 the effect of magnetic field is negligible , for grains smaller than this critical size the direction of the radial velocity depends on the polarity of grain s charge .",
    "outward mass flux is carried primarily by the positively charged grains with radii smaller than the critical radius @xmath105 .",
    "note that this result is based on the assumed magnetic field configuration .",
    "we considered a negative @xmath50 according to lovelace , romanova & newman ( 1994 ) .",
    "top plot of figure [ fig:3 ] shows the vertical velocity @xmath106 of dust particles vs. @xmath107 for various sizes of grains and @xmath100 and @xmath98 .",
    "since the radial velocity significantly increases for grains with @xmath108 due to the magnetic force , we expect larger vertical velocity comparing to the nonmagnetic solutions according to equation ( [ eq : vz1 ] ) . although both the radial and the vertical velocities increase due to the magnetic force for grains with radii smaller than @xmath105 , sedimentation of the particles can be determined based on the ratio of the time - scales of the sedimentation and the radial migration .",
    "the timescales of the sedimentation and the radial migration are defined as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "bottom plot of figure [ fig:3 ] shows the ratio @xmath111 vs. distance from the midplane of the disc .",
    "solid curves correspond to the magnetic solutions and the dashed curves are for the nonmagnetic solutions .",
    "each curve is labeled by the radius of the grain . as the size of grain decreases , the ratio of timescales increases .",
    "when the effect of magnetic force becomes significant , the ratio of the timescales is larger than the nonmagnetic case .",
    "for example , grains with radius @xmath112 @xmath102 m may sediment before any large migration in the radial direction in the nonmagnetic case .",
    "but magnetic field force significantly enhances the ratio of the timescales to values larger than unity which implies large radial migration before sedimentation .",
    "note that grains with radii 0.1 , 1 and 10 @xmath102 m have positive radial velocities near to the midplane ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "however , as the distance from the midplane increases , the radial velocity tends to zero at @xmath113 . beyond this location",
    "the radial velocity is negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the radial migration timescale is proportional to inverse of the radial velocity .",
    "the dip at the curves occurs at the location where the radial velocity tends to zero ( i.e. @xmath113 ) .",
    "but for grains with radius @xmath112 @xmath102 m , the radial velocity is negative for all the distances from the midplane .",
    "so , there is not a dip in its corresponding curve of the ratio of the timescales .",
    "we presented a model for the dynamics of charged grains in a magnetized , protoplanetary disc .",
    "properties of the gas component correspond to a minimum - mass solar nebula and the toroidal and the poloidal components of the magnetic field are assumed to be power - law .",
    "the vertical and the radial velocities of the charged dust particles depend on the geometry of the magnetic field , charge and mass of the grains . we assumed that each particle is charged one elementary charge .",
    "our model illustrates the importance of charge of dust grains in their motions beyond the dead zone .",
    "observations of protoplanetary discs , at least in the optical and infrared , mostly probe the upper disc layer . for charged grains with radii smaller than @xmath105 , effect of the magnetic force on their motion is stronger in the upper layers comparing to the midplane region . since magnetic force prevents sedimentation of such grains to the midplane of the disc",
    ", one may expect grains with radii larger than a critical radius in midplane region , unless smaller grains are neutral . in a disc resembling to the minimum - mass solar nebula , and assuming that all grains are charged",
    ", our model predicts that grains in midplane of the disc are mostly larger than @xmath103 @xmath102 m .",
    "dust sedimentation is known to affect the infrared spectra and the images of discs . in particular the far - infrared emission",
    "may be reduced by strong sedimentation .",
    "although we did not investigate spectra of the disc , it is interesting to study possible modifications to the spectra due to the charge of the grains and the magnetic force .",
    "however , in a more realistic model not only the coupling between the field lines and the charged grains should be considered but also the significant effects of magnetic fields on the gas component .",
    "takeuchi & lin ( 2003 ) studied the outflow of dust particles in the upper layers of optically disc .",
    "they showed that grains in surface layers are moving outward due to the stellar radiation .",
    "the outward mass flux is carried primarily by particles of size @xmath104 @xmath102 m according to their calculations .",
    "although we neglected the stellar radiation in our model , we expect strong outflows of sub - micron sized particles , if they are charged positively . in model of takeuchi & lin ( 2003 ) ,",
    "radiation pressure is the main physical factor in making surface outflows of grains .",
    "but in our model , it is the magnetic force which drives positively charged grains smaller than @xmath105 to move outward .",
    "the actual optical depth along the radial direction in the midplane of the disk is huge , and thus , the radiation pressure from the central star onto the dust grains should be negligible .",
    "but neutral grains smaller than the critical radius in the midplane region can move outward once they charged positively .",
    "when they reach to the surface layers , not the magnetic force but the radiation pressure contribute to their outward motion .",
    "it will be interesting to study surface outflows under combined action of gas drag , the radiation pressure , and the magnetic force in order to understand their relative importance in making surface outflows .",
    "\\(i ) motion of particles with radii smaller than @xmath105 are affected by the magnetic field , but larger particles move independent of their charge and the magnetic force . for input parameters corresponding to a minimum - mass solar nebula ,",
    "the critical radius is around 1 @xmath102 m and so , sub - micron sized particles are affected by the field lines .",
