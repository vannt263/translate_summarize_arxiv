    "the family of complex perovskites ab@xmath4b@xmath5o@xmath2 has been known for fifty years and are related to the classic abo@xmath2 perovskites but with different physical properties due to the chemical disorder on the b - sublattice . a very interesting sub - class of these complex perovskites is formed by the relaxor ferroelectrics , or shortly - relaxors .",
    "these materials have a frequency - dependent peak in the dielectric permittivity @xmath6 which typically extends over hundreds of degrees and is not directly related to any macroscopic changes of the symmetry . since many physical properties of relaxors exhibit anomalies in this temperature range , the properties were called a `` diffuse phase transition '' . despite many investigations ,",
    "however , the nature of the diffuse phase transition remains unclear  @xcite .",
    "pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmn ) is a model relaxor ferroelectric .",
    "it has the cubic pm@xmath7 m structure at all temperatures in the absence of an external electric field  @xcite .",
    "however , in an applied electric field , pmn undergoes a structural phase transition at t@xmath8  k  @xcite while the anomaly in the dielectric permittivity @xmath6 appears around the mean curie temperature t@xmath9  270  k  @xcite . at a higher temperature ,",
    "t@xmath10  k , the optical refractive index departs from the expected linear temperature dependence as observed by burns and scott  @xcite .",
    "this result was explained by the appearance of small polar regions of size of a few unit cells , which were referred to as polar nanoregions ( pnr ) .",
    "the lattice dynamics of pmn and similar relaxor crystals pbmg@xmath0ta@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmt ) , pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pzn ) and pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2-xpbtio@xmath2 ( pzn - xpt ) has been studied by light  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "first - order raman light scattering was observed in both pmn and pzn  @xcite , although first order scattering is forbidden if the crystal structure remains that of the cubic perovskites . until now",
    "there is no detailed understanding for the origin of the apparent first order raman scattering in the relaxors  @xcite .",
    "the search for a soft mode by light scattering in pmn was unsuccessful  @xcite , whereas the results of neutron scattering measurements have lead to the suggestion that the soft to phonons are overdamped for @xmath11  rlu and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this anomalous behavior of the to phonons was attributed to the formation of pnr in both pzn and pmn  @xcite , although an alternative interpretation was recently proposed that describes the results and the so called `` waterfall '' effect in terms of coupling between ta and highly damped to phonons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , both light and neutron spectroscopy have reported a quasi - elastic ( qe ) component in the phonon spectrum of pmn  @xcite .",
    "as anharmonicity is important in relaxors , it is _ a priori _ possible that this quasi - elastic mode originates from the strong coupling between the ta and heavily damped to phonon modes  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have used high resolution neutron scattering to investigate the low - energy part of the vibration spectrum of pmn as described in section 2 .",
    "we find in section 3 that the lowest transverse optic ( to ) phonon branch is strongly coupled to the transverse acoustic branch ( ta ) above the burns temperature , t@xmath3 , where the qe component is absent .",
    "below t@xmath3 , the results suggest that the phonon spectrum remains essentially unchanged , with the to phonons found to be under - damped throughout the temperature range and the `` waterfall effect '' is not clearly observed at least in the [ 0,0,q ] direction .",
    "in addition there are two more components of the scattering consisting of a quasi - elastic , qe , component whose energy width is larger than the resolution and a central peak , cp , component whose energy width is the same as the resolution function . the energy and wave - vector width of the qe component have been measured and it is found that the qe susceptibility is a maximum at a temperature of about 370 k , a somewhat larger temperature than the maximum in the dielectric susceptibility .",
    "the cp component increases rapidly in intensity below 370 k similarly to the behaviour expected from an order parameter .",
    "the line - shape of the scattering as a function of wave - vector is not however a sharp bragg reflection but is approximately a lorentzian to the power of 1.5 . in section 4",
    "we shall suggest that these results are consistent with a random field model for this relaxor .",
    "the measurements were carried out with the three - axis spectrometer tasp , located at the neutron spallation source sinq at the paul scherrer institut , switzerland .",
    "a high - quality single crystal of pmn ( @xmath13 8  @xmath14 ) was mounted using a niobium holder inside a furnace .",
    "the measurements were performed in the temperature range 150  k - 670  k. the crystal was aligned in the ( h  h  l)-scattering plane .",
    "the spectrometer had a pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) monochromator and analyzer and was operated in the constant final - energy mode . in the course of the measurements we had to search for compromises between the spectrometer resolution , the accessible ( @xmath15 ) range , and the intensity .",

    "our results for the scattering in the ( 1@xmath980 ) plane lead to quite a different picture and so initially we will compare and contrast our experimental results .",
    "the important phonons in pmn are the ta and lowest to branches and we agree that there is a strong coupling between these two modes of vibration and that they can strongly interact because they have the same symmetry .",
    "the earlier work found that above the burns temperature 620  k the to mode was underdamped and decreased in frequency as the temperature was decreased .",
    "below the burns temperature it became overdamped and the frequency could not be obtained until the sample was cooled below a temperature of 200  k when it increased in frequency and became underdamped again . throughout this intermediate region between 200  k and 620  k the to mode exhibited the `` waterfall effect '' at which the mode has an infinite slope and the wave - vector is almost constant . the critical wave - vector 0.2  @xmath23 suggested that this behaviour results from the interaction of the mode with the polar nano - regions ( pnr ) and with the strong coupling between the mode and the ta modes .",
    "later neutron scattering experiments  @xcite showed that the effect depends on the brillouin zone and hence it is probably unlikely that it is due to the size of the pnr .",
    "our results differ in that throughout the region immediately below the burns temperature we find that the inelastic scattering can be described at least at small wave - vectors in terms of largely temperature independent underdamped modes particularly for the to mode .",
    "we also did not observe a `` waterfall effect '' for the to mode .",
    "we consider that the reason for the first difference is that we used substantially better resolution than the previous work while for the second difference our observations were made in a different brillouin zone and so our results support the conclusion of hlinka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on their results for pzn .",
    "the high resolution of our results did enable us to distinguish two components at low energies ; one was the quasi - elastic scattering and the other the central peak .",
    "we have measured the intensity scattered by the to mode and by the qe scattering and found that the ratio differs from one brillouin zone to another .",
    "for example , the to mode is weak near ( 110 ) above the ta mode but the qe scattering is present .",
    "the qe scattering might arise from the to mode through the mode coupling because at low frequencies , below the ta phonon the to mode would have a different eigenvector from that above the ta mode .",
    "we would then expect a different structure factor for the to mode and the qe scattering as discussed in reference  @xcite .",
    "this effect does not however explain the difference in the intensities or the line shape of the scattering if the qe scattering is to be described by the interacting phonon model , outlined in the first part of section 3 .",
    "we can not however be certain that this is impossible if there is a strong frequency dependence to the self - energy of the to mode , such as in the well known central peak problem in srtio@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we shall in this paper discuss the qe scattering as though it was an independent mode of the crystal .",
    "we observe that the quasi - elastic scattering appears below the burns temperature t@xmath3 . upon cooling the sample the susceptibility of the qe scattering increases rapidly and peaks around @xmath99",
    "k. simultaneously the characteristic time of the fluctuations increases .",
    "the frequency and wave - vector dependence of the scattering are strongly suggestive of a phase transition at that temperature .",
    "thus we can conclude that below t@xmath3 we observe critical fluctuations that behave in a similar way to those of paraelectric or paramagnetic systems and one should expect a continuous phase transition when both the susceptibility and the correlation length diverge .",
    "the surprising feature is that the critical fluctuations in pmn have very low frequencies and are observed over an exceptionally wide temperature range between 200  k and 600  k. most systems undergoing a phase transition have critical fluctuations that appear much closer to the phase transition and with much higher energies .",
    "this suggests that the fluctuations in pmn involve large collections of atoms , possibly pnr , rather than individual atoms .",
    "below @xmath100 the susceptibility of the critical fluctuations in pmn decrease while the correlation length is approximately temperature independent equal to 11 @xmath30 .",
    "this situation resembles the case of an antiferromagnet in a random - field .",
    "the cp scattering is strictly elastic and so we shall assume that it is caused by short - range static displacements in which case it appears as diffuse scattering and not as bragg scattering .",
    "the theory of the phase transition in an isotropic - three - dimensional ferroelectric predicts that the critical fluctuations will be perpendicular to the wave - vector transfer .",
    "this scattering is then similar to that expected if the critical fluctuations of an isotropic ferroelectric were frozen in at a temperature somewhat above the phase transition .",
    "we observe that the intensity of the elastic diffuse scattering ( edf ) increases strongly below @xmath101  k expected for the temperature dependence of an order parameter .",
    "the fwhm of the this scattering decreases below @xmath100 indicating that static displacements are correlated over larger distances .",
    "the diffuse scattering , however , never turns into a bragg reflection . above @xmath100",
    "the diffuse scattering is very weak and disappears rapidly when approaching t@xmath3 in agreement with the results of hiraka _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . above @xmath100 ,",
    "the scattering is much weaker and it was difficult to analyse the line shape precisely , due to the presence of the strong bragg peak .",
    "below @xmath100 , the line - shape of the diffuse scattering is described by a lorentzian function raised to the power of @xmath102 .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour of an antiferromagnetic random field system in which the profile of the scattering is , after correction for the experimental resolution , a lorentzian squared  @xcite .",
    "if the correction is not made the observed profile depends on the detail of the resolution function but in some cases is observed to be a lorentzian to the power of about 1.5 .",
    "this onset of the elastic edf scattering in pmn is very suggestive of a random field transition at 370  k at which the ferroelectric critical scattering becomes pinned by the random field associated with the atomic disorder or pnr .",
    "it was suggested that the relaxors might be examples of random field transitions in reference  @xcite .",
    "a system with continuous symmetry is not expected to have a transition in the presence of a random field . nevertheless pmn and other relaxors are cubic materials rather than being isotropic and the cubic symmetry breaks the continuous symmetry and allows for a random field transition .",
    "most of the experimental work on random fields has been on random antiferromagnets in a uniform field which then generates a staggered antiferromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results then show that it is possible to reach a number of meta - stable states when the sample is cooled in a field . in the case of relaxors",
    "there has been little theoretical work developing a random field theory and in particular on the form of the transition in a cubic material .",
    "we suggest that as the sample is cooled the atomic disorder gives rise to dynamic clusters of pnr , as occurs in pmn below the burn s temperature of 620  k. these do not order because the system is effectively isotropic at elevated temperature and fluctuations prevent the establishment of static order . at a temperature of about 370  k",
    "anisotropy starts to play a role and there is a cross - over to a cubic phase as opposed to an isotropic phase .",
    "the system then orders into a meta - stable random field phase that is stable down to the lowest temperature .",
    "the crystal reaches a uniform ferroelectric state if a large field is applied below a temperature of 210  k.    we are planning further experiments both to study the detailed shape of the ordering and to discover if we can observe any cross - over from isotopic to cubic symmetry as well as to study the qe scattering and the cp scattering in different brillouin zones .",
