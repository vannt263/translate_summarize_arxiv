    "diffuse galactic microwave emission , apart from carrying important information on the fundamental properties of the interstellar medium , interferes with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ( see bouchet et al .",
    "polarization of the cmb provides information about the universe that is not contained in the temperature data alone .",
    "in particular , it offers a unique way to specifically trace the primordial perturbations of tensorial nature ( _ i.e. _ cosmological gravitational waves ) , and allows one to break some important degeneracies that remain in the measurement of cosmological parameters with intensity alone ( see zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 ) .    among different sources of polarized foregrounds ,",
    "interstellar dust is probably the most difficult to deal with ( see lazarian & finkbeiner 2003 for a review ) . polarized radiation from dust arises from grain being aligned .",
    "grain alignment has proven to be a very difficult problem .",
    "it is well known that the degree of grain alignment depends both on grain size and composition , leading to the frequency dependence of the polarization ( see kim & martin 1994 , hildebrand et al .",
    "moreover , in addition to the `` classical '' power - law distribution of larger grains ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) , dust has a population of tiny grains ( leger & puget 1984 ) , which are frequently called pah .",
    "while the studies of the alignment of such a particles , which are essentially large molecules , is only starting , the theory of alignment of `` classical '' large grains has a long and exciting history ( see lazarian 2003 for a review ) .",
    "theory of grain alignment has been developing fast recently , which makes even the most recent review by lazarian ( 2007 ) outdated in a number of respects . in what follows",
    "we provide an updated outlook on the grain alignment theory keeping in mind two interrelated issues , namely , + a ) how grain alignment theory can help in understanding of polarization to be measured by cmb - dedicated missions , e.g. cmbpol ; + b ) how cmbpol mission can help in understanding of grain alignment .",
    "there are historic reasons why the researchers may be reluctant to rely on grain alignment theory while modeling polarization from dust .",
    "grain alignment has a reputation of being an astrophysical problem of the longest standing . indeed , for a long time since the discovery of dust - induced starlight extinction polarization in 1949 ( hall 1949 ; hiltner 1949 ) the mechanism of alignment was both enigmatic and illusive .",
    "thus , for many years grain alignment theory did not have predictive powers .",
    "works by great minds like lyman spitzer and edward purcell moved the field forward in terms of understanding the basic grain dynamics physics .",
    "however , the theory was constantly failing to account for new observational data .",
    "1a demonstrates the complexity of grain motion as we understand it now .",
    "the weakness of the theory caused a somewhat cynical approach to it among some of the polarimetry practitioners who preferred to be guided in their work by the following rule of thumb : _ all grains are always aligned and the alignment happens with the longer grain axes perpendicular to magnetic field .",
    "_ this simple recipe was shattered , however , by observational data which indicated that + i. grains of sizes smaller than a critical size are either not aligned or marginally aligned ( mathis 1986 , kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "carbonaceous grains are not aligned , while silicate grains are aligned ( see mathis 1986 ) .",
    "a substantial part of small grains grains deep within molecular clouds are not aligned ( goodman et al .",
    "1995 , lazarian , goodman & myers 1997 , cho & lazarian 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "+ these facts were eloquent enough to persuade even the most sceptical types that the interpretation of interstellar polarimetric data does require an adequate theory .",
    "the challenges related to separating of the contribution from dust from the one by polarized cmb makes it even more urgent to develop a predictive theory of grain alignment .",
    "one should note that adequate grain alignment theory is able to give boost to many astrophysical fields .",
    "first of all , polarization from aligned dust is a widely used way to study magnetic fields in interstellar medium and molecular clouds . needless to say that ambiguities in grain alignment result in ambiguities of the interpretation of polarization in terms of the underlying magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , there are numerous astrophysical conditions when dust is bound to be aligned , but this fact is under - appreciated .",
    "for instance , a common explanation of light polarization from comets or circumstellar regions is based on light scattering by randomly oriented particles ( see bastien 1988 for a review ) .",
    "the low efficiency and slow rates of alignment were sometimes quoted to justify such an approach .",
    "however , it has been proven recently that grain alignment is an efficient and rapid process .",
    "therefore , we _ do expect _ to have circumstellar , interplanetary , and cometary dust aligned .",
    "of particular interest in this respect are t - tauri accretion disks ( see cho & lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "tracing magnetic fields in these environments with aligned grains opens new exciting avenues for polarimetry .    in this review",
    "i shall show that the modern grain alignment theory is consistent with the observations available.moreover , the theory allows us for the first time ever make quantitative _ predictions _ of the polarization degree from various astrophysical objects .",
    "however , the latter part of the studies is in its infancy .",
    "we expect that the growing interest to dust polarization from the cmb community will stimulate more work both in grain alignment theory and its observational testing .",
    "we feel that the cmbpol mission should both benefit from our current better understanding of grain alignment and provide the critical testing of the remaining controvercies related to the grain alignment theory .",
    "below , in  2 i shall show how the properties of polarized radiation are related to the statistics of aligned grains . in ",
    "3 i shall briefly discuss the main alignment mechanisms . in ",
    "4 i shall discuss the effects that are related to internal dissipation of energy in a wobbling grains . in  5",
    "i shall discuss the predictions obtained for the dominant mechanism of alignment , namely , the radiative torque alignment . in ",
    "6 , i shall discuss the prospects of grain alignment theory and in  7 i shall discuss the synergy of studying of cmb polarization and improving of our knowledge of grain alignment .",
    "a practical interest in aligned grains arises from the fact that their alignment results in polarization of the starlight passing through dust as well as in polarization in grain emission .",
    "below we discuss why this happens .      for an ensemble of aligned grains",
    "the degrees of extinction in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the direction of alignment are different",
    ". therefore initially unpolarized starlight acquires polarization while passing through a volume with aligned grains ( see fig .",
    "if the extinction in the direction of alignment is @xmath0 and in the perpendicular direction is @xmath1 one can write the polarization , @xmath2 , by selective extinction of grains as @xmath3 where the latter approximation is valid for @xmath4 . to relate the difference of extinctions to the properties of aligned grains",
    "one can take into account the fact that the extinction is proportional to the product of the grain density and their cross sections .",
    "if a cloud is composed of identical aligned grains @xmath0 and @xmath1 are proportional to the number of grains along the light path times the corresponding cross sections , which are , respectively , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in reality one has to consider additional complications ( like , say , incomplete grain alignment ) and variations in the direction of the alignment axis relative to the line of sight .",
    "( in most cases the alignment axis coincides with the direction of magnetic field . ) to obtain an adequate description , one can ( see roberge & lazarian 1999 ) consider an electromagnetic wave propagating along the line of sight ( the axis , as on fig .",
    "the transfer equations for the stokes parameters depend on the cross sections @xmath7 and @xmath8 for linearly polarized waves with the electric vector , , along the and axes perpendicular to ( lee & draine 1985 ) .        to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , one transforms the components of to the principal axes of the grain , and takes the appropriately - weighted sum of the cross sections @xmath5 and @xmath6 for polarized along the grain axes ( fig  1b illustrates the geometry of observations ) .",
    "when the transformation is carried out and the resulting expressions are averaged over the precession angles , one finds ( see transformations in lee & draine 1985 for spheroidal grains , and in efroimsky 2002a for the general case ) that the mean cross sections are @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 being the angle between the polarization axis and the plane , and @xmath12 being the effective cross section for randomly - oriented grains . to characterize the alignment , we used in eq .",
    "( [ eq-2_6 ] ) the rayleigh reduction factor ( greenberg 1968 ) defined as @xmath13 where angular brackets denote ensemble averaging , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the angle between the axis of the largest moment of inertia ( henceforth the axis of maximal inertia ) and the magnetic field @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the angle between the angular momentum @xmath18 and @xmath16 . to characterize the alignment with respect to the magnetic field ,",
    "the measures @xmath19 and @xmath20 are employed .",
    "unfortunately , these statistics are not independent and therefore @xmath21 is not equal to @xmath22 ( see lazarian 1998 , roberge & lazarian 1999 ) .",
    "this considerably complicates the description of the alignment process .",
    "aligned grains emit polarized radiation ( see fig .",
    "the difference in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for aligned dust results in the emission polarization : @xmath23 where both optical depths @xmath24 are @xmath1 were assumed to be small .",
    "taking into account that both @xmath25 and @xmath2 are functions of the wavelength @xmath26 and combining eqs.([pabs ] ) and ( [ pem ] ) , one obtains for @xmath27 @xmath28 which establishes the relation between the polarizations in emission and absorption . the minus sign in eq  ( [ pem ] ) reflects",
    "the fact that emission and absorption polarizations are orthogonal .",
    "this relation enables one to predict the far infrared polarization of emitted light if the starlight polarization is measured .",
    "this opens interesting prospects of predicting the foreground polarization arising from emitting dust using the starlight polarization measurements ( cho & lazarian 2002 , 2003 ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      one way of obtaining circular polarization is to have a magnetic field that varies along the line of sight ( martin 1972 ) .",
    "passing through one cloud with aligned dust the light becomes partially linearly polarized .",
    "on passing the second cloud with dust gets aligned in a different direction .",
    "hence , the light gets circular polarization .",
    "literature study shows that this effect is well remembered ( see menard et al 1988 ) , while another process entailing circular polarization is frequently forgotten .",
    "we mean the process of single scattering of light on aligned particles .",
    "an electromagnetic wave interacting with a single grain coherently excites dipoles parallel and perpendicular to the grain s long axis . in the presence of adsorption",
    ", these dipoles get phase shift , thus giving rise to circular polarization .",
    "this polarization can be observed from an ensemble of grains if these are aligned .",
    "the intensity of circularly polarized component of radiation emerging via scattering of radiation with @xmath30 wavenumber on small ( @xmath31 ) spheroidal particles is ( schmidt 1972 ) @xmath32 { \\bf e}\\right)({\\bf e}_0 { \\bf e})\\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the unit vectors in the directions of incident and scattered radiation , @xmath35 is the direction along the aligned axes of spheroids ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the particle polarizabilities along @xmath35 and perpendicular to it .",
    "the intensity of the circularly polarized radiation scattered in the volume @xmath38 at @xmath39 from the star at a distance @xmath40 from the observer is ( dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath43 is the number of dust grains per a unit volume , and @xmath44 is the cross section for producing circular polarization , which for small grains is @xmath45 . according to dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) circular polarization arising from single scattering on aligned grains can be as high as several percent for metallic or graphite particles , which is much more than one may expect from varying magnetic field direction along the line of sight ( martin 1971 ) . in the latter case , the linear polarization produced by one layer of aligned grains passes through another layer where alignment direction is different .",
    "if on passing through a single layer , the linear polarization degree is @xmath46 , then passing through two layers produces circular polarization that does not exceed @xmath47 .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that both linear and circular polarizations depend on the degree of grain alignment given by the rayleigh reduction factor ( see eq .  ( [ r ] ) ) .",
    "therefore it is the goal of the grain alignment theory to determine this factor .",
    "table  1 shows that the wide range of different time scales involved makes the brute force numerical approach doomed .",

    "this approach allowed them to account for magnetization fluctuations within the grain material , and thus provided a more accurate picture of the @xmath18 alignment .",
    "the first numerical treatment of d - g alignment was presented by purcell ( 1969 ) . by that time",
    ", it became clear that the original d - g mechanism is too weak to explain the observed grain alignment .",
    "however , jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) noticed that if interstellar grains contain superparamagnetic , ferro- or ferrimagnetic inclusions , the @xmath99 may be reduced by orders of magnitude .",
    "since @xmath107 of atoms in interstellar dust are iron , the formation of magnetic clusters in grains was not far fetched ( see martin 1995 ) .",
    "however , detailed calculations in roberge & lazarian ( 1999 ) showed that the degree of alignment achievable can not account for the observed polarization coming from molecular clouds if grains rotate thermally .",
    "this is the consequence of the thermal suppression of paramagnetic alignment first discussed by jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) .",
    "these internal magnetic fluctuations randomize grain orientation with respect to the magnetic field if the grain body temperature is close to the rotational one .",
    "purcell ( 1979 ) pointed out that fast rotating grains are immune to both gaseous and internal magnetic randomization .",
    "substantial degrees of alignment could be possible if the rotation in the same direction could be preserved by the external uncompensated torques .",
    "both the radiative torques and other , subtle processes that we discuss dealing with grain rotation limit the ability of grain alignment in accordance with the purcell ( 1979 ) suggestion ( see spitzer & mcglynn 1979 , lazarian & draine 1999a , hoang & lazarian 2008 ) .",
    "lazarian & draine ( 2000 ) predicted that pah - type particles can be aligned paramagnetically due to the relaxation that is faster than the dg predictions .",
    "in fact , they showed that the dg alignment is not applicable to very swiftly rotating particles , for which the barnett magnetic field gets comparable to magnetic fields induced by uncompensated spins in the paramagnetic material . for such grains ,",
    "this relaxation is more efficient than the one considered by davis & greenstein ( 1951 ) .",
    "this effect , that is termed `` resonance relaxation '' in lazarian & draine ( 2000 ) , allows the alignment of pahs .",

    "the gold ( 1951 ) mechanism is a process of mechanical alignment of regular grains .",
    "we shall understand by regular grains the grains that do not exhibit helicity ( cf . ",
    "[ subsonic ] ) .",
    "grains presented by spheroids and bricks are the kind of regular grains we are talking about .",
    "the original gold ( 1951 ) idea is easy to understand .",
    "consider a needle - like grain interacting with a stream of atoms .",
    "assuming that collisions are inelastic , it is easy to see that every bombarding atom deposits with the grain an angular momentum @xmath108 , which is directed perpendicular to both the needle axis @xmath109 and the velocity of atoms @xmath110 .",
    "it is obvious that the resulting grain angular momenta will be in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the stream .",
    "it is also easy to see that this type of alignment will be efficient only if the flow is supersonic .",
    "the quantitative numerical study of the gold alignment in roberge et al .",
    "( 1995 ) was done under the assumption of the perfect coupling of @xmath18 with the axis of maximal inertia .",
    "this study shows a good correspondence with an analytical formulae for the alignment of @xmath18 vector in l94 when the gas - grain velocities are hypersonic . an analytical study in lazarian ( 1997 ) accounts for the incomplete internal alignment in a more sophisticated way , compared to l94 , and predicts the rayleigh reduction factors of @xmath111 and more for grains interacting with the alfven waves .",
    "as we discuss below , purcell ( 1979 ) introduced the concept of pinwheel torques that act to induce grain rotation with velocities much in excess of the thermal brownian rate .",
    "such fast rotating grains seemed not to be susceptible to the gold ( 1951 ) process .",
    "this persuaded many researchers that mechanical alignment is of marginal importance .",
    "indeed , it seems natural to accept that fast rotation makes it difficult for gaseous bombardment to align grains . however , the actual situation is more interesting .",
    "first of all , it was proven that mechanical alignment of suprathermally rotating grains is possible ( lazarian 1995 ) .",
    "two mechanisms that were termed `` crossover '' and `` cross section '' alignment were introduced there .",
    "the mechanisms were further elaborated and quantified in lazarian & efroimsky ( 1996 ) , lazarian , ozik & efroimsky ( 1996 ) , efroimsky ( 2002b ) .",
    "second , lazarian & drane ( 1999ab ) showed that grains may be thermally trapped and not rotate at high speed in spite of the presence of pinwheel torques ( see more in  [ pinwheel ] ) . the original gold ( 1951 ) alignment should be applicable to such grains .",
    "moreover , supersonic velocities may be available in the interstellar medium due to mhd turbulence ( lazarian & yan 2002 , yan & lazarian 2003 , yan , lazarian & draine 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , the problem of the mechanical alignment of regular grains is not that it is not efficient , but that in many cases the process may be subdominant .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when a grain has intrinsic helicity",
    ". the mechanical alignment may be important for small grains , e.g. pahs , if they move supersonically in respect to gas or flow of ions .",
    "astrophysical grains are known to be irregular . therefore they can , for instance , scatter more impinging atoms to the right than to the left , the same way that a model grain in fig .",
    "[ amo ] scatters photons .",
    "if present , the helicity radically changes the dynamics of grains .",
    "as far as we know , the mechanical alignment of helical grains was first briefly discussed in lazarian ( 1995 ) and lazarian , goodman & myers ( 1997 ) , but was not elaborated there .",
    "lazarian & hoang ( 2007b ) calculated the torques acting on a model helical grains and showed that effective alignment is possible for subsonic drifts of grains in respect to the ambient gas .",
    "the estimates obtained their are very encouraging , but they appeal to the details of grain - gas interaction that should be clarified by the further research .",
    "it is easy to understand why supersonic drift may not be necessary for helical grains . for such grains the momentum deposited by regular torques scales in proportion to the number of collisions , while the randomization adds up only as a random walk .",
    "in fact , the difference between the mechanical alignment of spheroidal and helical grains is similar to the difference between the harwit ( 1971 ) alignment by stochastic absorption of photons and the radiative torque alignment ( see   [ rats ] ) . indeed , while the harwit ( 1971 ) alignment requires very special conditions to overpower the gaseous and emission randomization ( purcell & spitzer 1971 ) , the radiative torques acting on a helical grain easily beat randomization .",

    "these torques were shown to be subdominant in most astrophysical conditions ( purcell & spitzer 1971 ) . in",
    "what follows , we do not consider stochastic radiative torques .    _",
    "regular _ radiative torques were introduced by dolginov and mytrophanov ( 1976 ) who considered `` twisted grains '' that can be characterized by some _",
    "helicity_. they noticed that `` helical '' grains would scatter differently the left- and right - polarized light , for which reason an ordinary unpolarized light would spin them up .",
    "the subset of the `` helical '' grains was not properly identified , and the later researchers could assume that it is limited to special shapes / materials .",
    "one way or another , this ground - breaking work did not make much impact to the field until draine & weingartner ( 1996 ) numerically showed that grains of rather arbitrary irregular shapes experience strong radiative torques .",
    "this initially was interpreted as the evidence of the fast grain rotation , but later research that radiative torques can both spin - up and slow down grains . in particular , lazarian & hoang ( 2007a ) noticed that grain rotation may be essentially stopped by radiative torques . in the presence of thermal fluctuations grains",
    "do not completely stop , but rotate at subthermal rates at low-@xmath116 attractor points ( weingartner & draine 2003 , hoang & lazarian 2008a ) .",
    "a key point is that anisotropic starlight radiation can _ align _ grains on their own , i.e. without the influence of any other , e.g. paramagnetic , mechanism .",
    "in fact , in most cases , in particular in diffuse interstellar gas , the radiative torques are so strong that they absolutely dominate the dynamics of grains .",
    "the effect of alignment induced by radiative torques was discovered by dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) . in their paper",
    "they considered a tilted oblate grain with the helicity axes coinciding with the axis of maximal inertia , as well as a tilted prolate grain for which the two axes were perpendicular .",
    "they concluded , that subjected to a radiation flux , the tilted oblate grain will be aligned with longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field , while the tilted prolate grain will be aligned with the longer axes parallel to magnetic field . the problem was revisited by lazarian ( 1995 ) , who took into account the internal relaxation of energy within grains and concluded that both prolate and oblate grains will be aligned with longer axes perpendicular to the magnetic field",
    "however , lazarian ( 1995 ) did not produce quantitative calculations and underestimated the relative importance of radiative torque alignment compared to other mechanisms .",
    "curiously enough is that our recent analysis of the alignment of an irregular grain mechanical properties of which are presented by a triaxial ellipsoid revealed that , even without internal relaxation , grains tend to get aligned with long axes perpendicular to magnetic field ( hoang & lazarian 2008c ) .    the explosion of interest to the radiative torques we owe to bruce draine , who realized that the torques can be treated with the dda code by draine & flatau ( 1994 ) and modified the code correspondingly .",
    "the magnitude of torques were found to be substantial and present for grains of all irregular shapes studied in draine ( 1996 ) , draine & weingartner ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "after that it became impossible to ignore the radiative torque alignment .",
    "more recently , radiative torques have been studied in laboratory conditions ( abbas et al .",
    "in what follows we identify the alignment by radiative torques with the alignment of grains by the anisotropic radiation flux .",
    "this corresponds to the original thinking in dolginov & mytorphanov ( 1976 ) .",
    "the draine & weingartner ( 1996 , 1997 ) papers signified a qualitative change in the landscape of grain alignment theory .",
    "although the numerical modeling there was rather simplified , these papers conjectured that radiative torques alignment may be the dominant mechanism in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2003 ) attempted to make more realistic modeling by accounting for thermal fluctuations within grains ( see  [ wobbling ] ) .             the analytical model for radiative torque alignment",

    "are other alignment directions feasible ?",

    "thus , superparamagnetic grains always rotate at high rate in the presence of radiative torques .",
    "one concludes that , rather unexpectedly , intensive paramagnetic relaxation changes the rotational state of the grains , enabling them to rotate _ rapidly_. the alignment of grains at high-@xmath116 point is _ perfect_.",
    "pinwheel torques were considered by purcell ( 1979 ) in the context of paramagnetic alignment . how do these torques also affect the radiative torque alignment ?",
    "hoang & lazarian ( 2008b ) showed that the sufficiently strong pinwheel torques can create new high-@xmath116 attractor points .",

    "all this testify in favor of radiative torques as a dominant mechanism for the alignment of astrophysical grains .",
    "the questions that require further studies include resolving the issue of whether interstellar grains are superparamagnetic or paramagnetic .",
    "as we discussed above , if grains are superparamagnetic , their alignment is much easier to predict . in most of the interstellar conditions we expect",

    "detailed calculations should clarify the actual degree of helicity of irregular grains and the magnitude of the mechanical torques on such grains .",
    "the corresponding calculations are straightforward and we expect to have the answer before the cmbpol launch .",
    "radiative torques predict the alignment of interstellar grains larger than @xmath150  cm , which is in an excellent agreement with the empirical serkowski ( 1973 ) curve ( see lazarian 2007 ) . for particles much less than the wavelength the efficiency of radiative torques drops as @xmath151 ( see lazarian 1995 ) . within circumstellar regions , where uv flux is enhanced smaller grains can be aligned by radiative torques .",
    "this could present a possible solution for the reported anomalies of polarization in the 2175   extinction feature ( see anderson et al 1996 ) which have been interpreted as evidence of graphite grain alignment ( wolff et al 1997 ) .",

    "this effect arises from the coupling of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom via internal relaxation ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & roberge 1997 , weingartner 2008 , hoang & lazarian 2008b ) .",
    "therefore while @xmath18 can be aligned with magnetic field , the grain axes may be randomized in respect to @xmath18 during the short periods of pah emission . on the contrary , the dipole emission arising from pahs in accordance with the `` spinning dust '' process in draine & lazarian ( 1998 ) proceeds all the time and , moreover ,",
    "is relatively insensitive to the randomization of grain axes .",
    "the only quantitative study of pah alignment is one in lazarian & draine ( 2000 ) .",
    "there the so - called `` resonance paramagnetic relaxation ''",
    "process was appealed to . the traditional davis - greenstein ( 1951 )",
    "relaxation is not applicable to small grains , as it disregards the important magnetization arising from the barnett effect .",
    "this magnetization is very strong for the rapidly rotating pahs .",
    "moreover , the magnetization that arises is exactly of the right magnitude to induce paramagnetic resonance and therefore the dissipation much stronger than in the davis - greenstein process .",
    "nevertheless , the polarization arising from the pahs predicted in lazarian & draine ( 2000 ) is marginal for the emission at frequencies higher than 30ghz ( see fig .",
    "[ micropah ] )",
    "the contribution from the zodiacal dust is taken into account for the emission studies of cmb . at the same time",
    ", radiative torque mechanism should make the zodiacal dust at least partially aligned .",
    "indeed , our study in lazarian & hoang ( 2007a ) shows that the radiative torques do not decrease when grain sizes are larger than the wavelength of impinging radiation , contrary to the predictions in dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) .",
    "moreover , hoang & lazarian ( 2008c ) showed that grains should be aligned even when they are so large enough that the internal relaxation becomes negligible .",
    "the polarized emission by zodiacal light may influence the studies by cmbpol and therefore should be accounted for .",
    "a possible study of the polarization arising from the zodiacal light may be attempted in far infrared prior to the cmbpol mission . however",
    ", even optical studies may clarify this issue , if we take into account that scattering from the aligned grains can result in circularly polarized radiation , as it discussed in ",
    "[ circular ]      the problem discussed in  [ magnetic ] was the superparamagnetic nature of the dust .",
    "superparamagnetic and , in general , strongly magnetic dust produces polarized microwave magneto - dipole emission , which can interfere with the cmb polarization studies ( draine & lazarian 1999 ) .",
    "if the magnetic properties of dust are better constrained as a result of testing of grain alignment predictions , this should simplify the removal of dust magnetic contribution at the microwave range .",
    "similarly , a better understanding of pahs alignment should facilitate the removal of the `` spinning dust '' polarized contribution .",
    "understanding of grain alignment is essential for the successful separating of the cmb polarization from the polarization arising from dust .",
    "any construction of a polarization template for the dust foreground uses the assumptions on grain alignment .",
    "the progress in understanding of grain alignment can be gauged by modeling of polarization in interstellar gas , molecular clouds , accretion disks .",
    "the correspondence of the theory and observations obtained along these directions is encouraging ( see lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "however , more detailed modeling is required .",
    "we hope that by the time of cmbpol mission the grain alignment theory will be better tested and therefore reliable .",
    "however , additional tests that cmbpol data can provide will also be useful .",
    "for the purposes of testing grain alignment the larger coverage of frequencies is advantageous .",
    "thus the project epic - cs or epic-2 m would be preferable .",
    "quantitative predictions of grain alignment that are possible these days ( see  [ predictions ] ) allow quantitative testing .    in other words",
    ", cmbpol requires better understanding of grain alignment to get cleaner polarization signal from the early universe and grain alignment theory can benefit from the cmbpol mission .",
    "the importance of the latter should not be underestimated .",
    "indeed , grain alignment theory is aimed at studies of magnetic fields in various environments . in lazarian ( 2007 ) , apart from interstellar medium , other environments , e.g. dark clouds , accretion disks , comets , galactic nuclei , agns and seyfet galaxies , are discussed .",
    "therefore the progress in understanding how well magnetic fields are traced by aligned dust particles is essential for many astrophysical studies .",
    "combining polarimetric data at very different wavelength it is possible to get insight into magnetic field structure . examples of such studies combining far infrared , near infrared and optical polarimetry are discussed in lazarian ( 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , one may mention yet another interesting possibility .",
    "the studies of molecular cloud column densities with the near infrared scattered light were presented in padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and juvela et al .",
    "those have shown that large scale mapping of scattered intensity is possible up to @xmath153 even for clouds illuminated by the average interstellar radiation field",
    ". the polarization of scattered light should be affected by grain alignment .",
    "this opens interesting prospects of detailed mapping of magnetic fields at sub - arcsecond resolution .",
