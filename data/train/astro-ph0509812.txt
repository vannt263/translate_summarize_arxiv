    "two more spheroidal components are needed to account for the observed numbers of stars , a central bulge and a halo .",
    "the density distribution of the stellar halo is still poorly constrained , but it extends to distances in excess of 100 kpc from the galactic plane , and its density in the plane is likely a fraction of a percent of the thin disk density ( norris 1999 ; chen et al .",

    "the derivation of stellar densities from star counts involves several assumptions .",
    "for example , only very rough information on chemical composition and luminosity is available from broad - band photometric observations alone , forcing practitioners to adopt pre - determined relationships , and to rely on the hypothesis that dwarfs outnumber evolved stars in any given field .",
    "spectroscopic surveys of galactic stars , despite being of necessity biased in order to sample low - density populations ( such as the galactic halo in the solar neighborhood ) , are extremely valuable to complement star count analyses and unravel co - existing stellar populations .",
    "kinematics and chemical abundances expand our view of the galaxy from a snapshot provided by star counts to a more dynamical perspective , allowing the study of not just the present structure of the milky way , but to peer into its formation and evolution ( see , e.g. , chiba & beers 2000 , 2001 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ; nordstrm et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "extensive spectroscopic surveys with high spectral resolution have so far been primarily restricted to the solar neighborhood .",
    "single - object spectrographs delivering medium - resolution spectra have been the workhorse for studies of large numbers of more distant stars ( e.g. , beers , preston , & shectman 1992 ; beers 1999 ; wilhelm et al .",
    "1999b ; brown et al . 2003 ; christlieb 2003 ) , but recently , highly - multiplexed spectrographs have made possible an increase of the data acquisition rate by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the near future is even more exciting , with the advent of planned new instruments able to gather spectra for thousands of targets simultaneously , over large fields , at high spectral resolution , and without gaps in solid - angle ( e.g. , hill & macqueen 2002 ; moore , gillingham , & saunders 2002 ) .",
    "the now - completed sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 ; sdss ) has imaged about one fourth of the sky with five broad - band filters and obtained follow - up intermediate dispersion ( @xmath13 ) spectroscopy of numerous targets . in its spectroscopic mode , up to 640 fibers can be simultaneously positioned on the focal plane of the sdss 2.5 m telescope to feed two identical spectrographs , both providing continuous coverage in the range 381 - 910 nm ( newman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the criteria for selecting sdss spectroscopic targets are rather complex ( see strauss et al . 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "galaxies and quasar candidates take about 90% of the fibers ; the remaining fibers are used to observe the sky background and galactic stars .",
    "the stars are either selected for being of special interest ( e.g. , white dwarfs , blue horizontal - branch stars , carbon stars , late - type m - dwarfs , brown dwarf candidates , etc . ) , or because they lie within a narrow color range intended for refinement of reddening determinations or flux calibration .",
    "in addition , a fraction of the sdss quasar candidates turned out to be stars ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) . with exposure times of the order of 45 minutes",
    ", the targeted stars have @xmath14 magnitudes in the range 1422 , signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath15 ) between 4 and 60 , and lie at distances of up to a few hundred kiloparsecs from the galactic plane .",
    "more than @xmath16 stellar spectra will be released to the public by the end of 2006 .",
    "nearly 50,000 stellar spectra were made publicly available in the second data release ( abazajian et al .",

    "dr4 became public on july 2005 ( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2005 ) , expanding the public database with over 12,000 new stellar spectra .    among the stellar targets in the sdss database , low - mass stars are of particular interest because they have long lives and",
    "thus can be used to trace the chemical evolution of the galaxy . in principle , the numbers of low - mass stars at different metallicities reflects the history of star formation and galaxy assembly .",
    "accurate analysis of relative chemical abundances is now routinely possible for f- and g - type stars within the framework of classical one - dimensional model atmospheres ( but see , e.g. , asplund 2005 for caveats ) .",

    "a number of improvements have been made to the sdss spectroscopic pipeline for dr2/dr3 , in particular to the spectrophotometric calibration and to the determination of radial velocities , as compared to data released in dr1 and the early data release ( edr ) .",
    "for each plugplate , 16 fibers are allocated to f - type stars that serve as reddening or spectrophotometric calibrators ( in equal proportions ) .",
    "the relative flux calibration is obtained by assigning a spectral type to each calibration star , and using synthetic spectra based on kurucz s model atmospheres to remove the instrumental response .",
    "absolute fluxes are derived by forcing the @xmath22-band magnitudes computed from the corrected calibration spectra to match the @xmath22 magnitudes from the calibrators measured by the photometric pipeline . for more details",

    "we change the wavelength scale to standard air ( edln 1966 ) , and re - sample the spectra linearly .",
    "assuming that the sdss spectrographs deliver @xmath23 , independent of wavelength , we smooth the spectra to a resolving power @xmath24 by convolution with a gaussian profile equivalent to @xmath25 .",
    "this step is taken following tests with edr spectra , which indicated that for our purposes it is advantageous to trade resolution for @xmath15 .",
    "the uncertainties provided as part of the sdss spectra are also corrected for the change in resolution .",
    "we first determine the velocity shifts of several strong features ( h@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , and caii k ) to obtain an independent measurement of the stellar radial velocities and their uncertainties .",
    "the spectra in which we could not identify balmer lines were not considered for further analysis , as they are either very hot , very noisy , exhibit emission features , or are too cool , and thus unsuitable for the analysis techniques described below .",
    "the reference wavelengths were derived from the solar spectrum observed at much higher resolving power and smoothed to the appropriate resolution .",
    "the spectra are then shifted in velocity to the rest frame and re - sampled with three data points per resolution element .",

    "such velocities exceed the escape velocity from the galaxy , and therefore a few of these objects may belong to the same class as the hyper - velocity star recently reported by brown et al .",

    ", we trimmed the spectra to the region 440 - 550 nm , increasing the analysis speed by a factor of about five as compared to an analysis of the full spectral range .",
    "the spectra are normalized by iteratively fitting a sixth - order polynomial to the pseudo - continuum , clipping off points that lie farther than 1@xmath33 below , or 4@xmath33 above the fitting curve . as the absolute flux calibration is tied to the photometric scale of the imaging survey , and the relative spectrophotometry is based on fluxes calculated in a similar way as those we match to the observations in our analysis , little information is lost by applying this correction . in addition , the impact of reddening on the spectra is essentially removed .",
    "in addition to the spectra , we also use sdss @xmath19 photometry to constrain the stellar parameters .",

    "we adopted reference solar abundances as in asplund , grevesse & sauval ( 2004 ) .",
    "these solar abundances include the recently revised values of the photospheric c , o , and fe abundances , which are roughly 0.2 dex lower than those used by kurucz ( 1993 ) .",
    "thus , we corrected for this amount in the selection of the atmospheric structures and low - resolution fluxes from kurucz s grid .",
    "some chemical elements have abundance ratios to iron that are non - solar in metal - poor stars ; this is largely ignored in our modeling .",
