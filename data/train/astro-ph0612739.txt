    "there is now a large body of evidence indicating that the universe is accelerating today .",
    "dark energy is often assumed to explain the present cosmic acceleration and has been extensively studied .",
    "although a lot of models for dark energy have been proposed and investigated , we still do not know the nature of dark energy .",
    "thus phenomenological investigations have also been widely conducted by parametrizing the dark energy equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "constraints on @xmath4 have been obtained from cosmological observations such as those of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , large scale structure and so on .",
    "when one tries to constrain @xmath4 , the simplest case would be to assume constancy in time , but most of the recent analyses accommodate time variation of @xmath4 in some way as predicted by many models of dark energy .",
    "we note that a flat universe is usually assumed when constraining the time dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "the assumption is often justified by invoking a prediction of the inflation or by resorting to confirmation by cosmological observations . however , we should test the inflationary paradigm by measuring the curvature of the universe , and observational evidence of a flat universe is often obtained assuming a cosmological constant for dark energy . therefore , not knowing the nature of the dark energy , it is important to investigate the curvature of the universe with various dark energy models .",
    "in fact , when we allow the possibility of a non - flat universe , it has been pointed out that there are some degeneracies in the cmb power spectrum between the curvature of the universe and the equation of state of dark energy even if we assume a constant equation of state @xcite .",
    "hence if we consider the possibilities of a non - flat universe and a time - varying equation of state simultaneously , the degeneracy can become much worse .",
    "theoretical considerations on this curvature - dark energy degeneracy can be found in refs .",
    "analyses based on the recent observational data sets have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple time dependence of an equation of state as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the scale factor , was assumed and the possibility of a non - flat universe was considered simultaneously .",
    "the constraints were obtained from observations of cmb , sneia and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) .",
    "it was shown that , even if we assume the time - varying equation of state , the curvature of the universe is constrained to be around a flat one .",
    "in fact , when a time - varying @xmath4 is considered , the constraint on the curvature of the universe from a single kind of observation is significantly relaxed compared to that obtained assuming a cosmological constant .",
    "however , if we combine three different sorts of observations , such a degeneracy is removed , giving a tight constraint on the curvature of the universe .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , another parametrization was considered to investigate the above issue .",
    "we have shown that , in a certain parametrization , the constraint on the curvature of the universe becomes much less stringent even if we combine the different cosmological data .",
    "in particular , the allowed region for the curvature of the universe extends to the region of an open universe . in other words",
    ", it was shown that the constraint on the curvature of the universe can depend on a model of dark energy .    in this paper",
    ", we reinvestigate the issue of determining the curvature of the universe with various dark energy parametrizations in the light of the recently released data set which includes the 13 sneia with @xmath7 newly discovered using the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "we show that , for some models of dark energy , the curvature of the universe is severely constrained to be around the flat case from three observations combined even though the evolution of dark energy equation of state is allowed to vary in time as found in ref .",
    "however , if we adopt another parametrization for @xmath4 of some type , we do not obtain a severe constraint on the curvature of the universe but rather the region of an open universe is largely allowed .",
    "we also discuss what kinds of dark energy models allow the universe to be non - flat , briefly .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the parametrizations for dark energy adopted in this paper .",
    "then , in section [ sec : method ] , the analysis method is briefly explained . in section [ sec : constraint ] , we present our result for the constraint on the curvature of the universe for several parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state . in the final section ,",
    "we give conclusion and discussion .",
    "in this section , we summarize the parametrizations for dark energy equation of state adopted in this paper .",
    "when one tries to accommodate a time - varying equation of state , one of the simplest parametrizations may be the one which adds a linear dependence on the scale factor @xmath6 as follows @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the redshift .",
    "we call this parametrization a in this paper . in this parametrization ,",
    "the equation of state becomes @xmath10 at the present time and @xmath11 at earlier time .",
    "if @xmath4 becomes larger than 0 , it means that the energy density of dark energy decreases faster than that of matter .",
    "since we investigate the case where dark energy drives the late time cosmic acceleration , we do not consider such a possibility , which can be taken into account by assuming @xmath12 notice that this prior of negative @xmath4 is always assumed in the following analysis .",
    "the energy density for dark energy with the parametrization of eq .   can be written analytically as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy density of dark energy at the present time .",
    "the next parametrization for dark energy used in this paper is the following one : @xmath15 where we interpolate @xmath4 linearly from the present epoch to a redshift @xmath16 to which we refer as the transition redshift .",
    "we call this parametrization b. the value of the equation of state becomes @xmath17 today and @xmath18 before the transition redshift .",
    "the energy density of dark energy can be written as @xmath19 ( 1+z)^{3(1 + w_0 - \\alpha ) }   & (   { \\rm for}~~ z \\le z _ * )   \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\exp [ 3 \\alpha z _ * ] ( 1+z_*)^{3(1 + w_0 - \\alpha ) }   \\displaystyle\\left (   \\frac{1+z}{1+z_*}\\right)^{3(1+w_1 ) } & ( { \\rm for}~~ z \\ge z _ * ) ,     \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 in fact , this parametrization is essentially the same as the one with @xmath21 with a cut - off at some redshift to avoid a large value of @xmath4 at early times , which has been adopted in the literatures _",
    "e.g. _ refs .  @xcite . in the following analysis",
    ", we consider several values of @xmath16 fixed , then vary other parameters .",
    "the third parametrization for a dark energy equation of state adopted in the following is the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which is written as @xmath22 ^ 2 } , \\label{eq : eos3}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 represents the value of @xmath4 at the present time which should be negative in order to realize the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is assumed to be positive to avoid a singularity of @xmath25 at some redshift for @xmath26 .",
    "thus , as the redshift increases , the value of @xmath4 approaches @xmath27 which can include the possibilities that dark energy contributes to the total energy of the universe to some extent at an earlier epoch .",
    "in fact , this parametrization is motivated to include such an early time dark energy @xcite .",
    "we call this parametrization c. the energy density of dark energy for this parametrization can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] .    after specifying the model and its parameters",
    ", we can calculate the evolution of the hubble parameter using @xmath30,\\ ] ] where the integration in the dark energy density can be analytically performed in our cases as mentioned above .",
    "this in turn is used to compute cosmological distances which are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the analysis method and cosmological data used in this paper .    for the data from sneia , we fit the distance modulus calculated in a dark energy model to the observational data released recently @xcite .",
    "we use 182 sneia from the gold data provided in @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus can be calculated as @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the luminosity distance in units of mpc which is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 for a closed universe , @xmath36 for an open universe and @xmath37 with the factor @xmath38 being removed for a flat universe .    for the cmb data , we make use of the shift parameter which is a good measure of the position of the first peak of the cmb power spectrum which can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the redshift of the epoch of the recombination . from the three - year wmap result @xcite , the shift parameter is constrained to be @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "since here we consider the shift parameter which is determined only by the background evolution for the constraint from cmb , we do not need to include the effect of the fluctuation of dark energy . in this paper , by using a shift parameter , we can confine ourselves to considering the effects of the modification of the background evolution alone .",
    "we also include the data of bao making use of the so - called parameter @xmath42 : @xmath43^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath42 is measured as @xmath45 @xcite . here",
    "the dependence on the scalar spectral index is shown explicitly .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , we adopt @xmath46 which is the mean value for @xmath47cdm model from wmap3 data alone @xcite .",
    "( since the main effect of dark energy equation of state on the cmb power spectrum is just shifting the acoustic peak positions , @xmath48 would be similar value even if we did not assume a cosmological constant .",
    "actually , the mean value for the model with a constant equation of state of dark energy is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "thus the use of @xmath47cdm mean value should not affect our quantitative results . )",
    "we present constraints from all three observations combined in the next section .",
    "in this section , we show constraints on the curvature of the universe for several parametrizations of the time evolution of dark energy equation of state introduced in sec .  [ sec : params ] .",
    "we present the results in figs .",

    "[ fig : a ] shows the constraint for the parametrization a ( eq .  ) as well as the cases with a cosmological constant and a constant equation of state ( in terms of the parametrization a , a cosmological constant can be regarded as the case with @xmath53 and @xmath54 and a constant equation of state as for the @xmath54 case ) . for the parametrization a , we marginalize over @xmath23 and @xmath55 and for a constant equation of state , @xmath23 is marginalized over . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] , the allowed regions for three cases lie closely around a flat universe ( denoted by the straight line @xmath56 ) .",
    "this means that , even if we drop the assumption of a cosmological constant for dark energy , as long as the dark energy equation of state is constant or its time variation is expressed as the parametrization a , the curvature of the universe is well constrained to be around the flat case ( although the allowed region for the case with the parametrization a is slightly larger than those for the other cases ) .",
    "in fact , this finding was already made in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is reconfirmed by the analysis here with updated data sets .",
    "notice that , of course , a single kind of observation has severe degeneracy among the curvature of the universe and the dark energy parameters @xmath23 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , such a degeneracy is removed when we use three data combined as discussed in ref .",
    "we also compute other constraints such as the one in the @xmath50-@xmath23 plane , the @xmath23-@xmath55 plane and so on using updated data and find that they are almost unchanged from those of the previous analysis of ref .  @xcite .",
    "next we show the result for the parametrization b ( eq .  ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] . it has three model parameters in the equation of state , @xmath23 , @xmath55 and @xmath16 . here",
    "we report our analysis , fixing the value of @xmath16 to several values to see how the transition redshift affects the constraint on the curvature of the universe , which is , as it turns out , important for understanding what type of dark energy allows a considerably non - flat universe . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] , the constraints for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are shown .",
    "we marginalize over @xmath23 and @xmath55 .",
    "the constraint on the curvature of the universe for this parametrization was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that a significantly large region of an open universe is allowed for some particular transition redshift @xmath16 .",
    "although the analysis in the present paper includes more sneia with high redshift @xmath59 than were used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the general results on the constraint on the curvature are almost unchanged .",
    "we can see that the curvature is constrained to be around the flat case to some extent when the transition redshift is as small as @xmath60 or as large as @xmath61 .",
    "this is because , when the transition redshift is small , such a model becomes like the one with a constant @xmath4 . in this case , the curvature is well constrained to be around the flat case as similar to the case in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath16 is large , this model behaves like the parametrization a ; thus the constraint is similar to that of the case in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] , where the curvature is also constrained to be around the flat case",
    ". however , when the transition redshift is in an intermediate range such as @xmath62 , the allowed region includes a larger region of an open universe .",
    "the parameters which give the best fit to the data for the case with @xmath63 are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "typically a model which gives a good fit to the data has its equation of state being smaller than @xmath66 at the present and nearly 0 in the past .",
    "thus a model of dark energy which allows an open universe is like one which behaves similarly to the matter at earlier time , but at present time , its equation of state becomes very small .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that the minimum value of the total @xmath67 for the case with @xmath68 becomes smaller than that of the @xmath47cdm case by 4.1 , which means that this parametrization can give a better fit to the data than the @xmath47cdm model .",
    "the current cosmological data can not give a stringent constraint on the curvature of the universe when we assume this kind of dark energy model , as was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we are going to discuss the case with the parametrization c ( eq .  ) .",
    "we show the constraint for this model in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] with two different priors .",
    "the first prior is somewhat generic : @xmath69 ( panel ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] ) .",
    "the other prior is meant to avoid a so - called phantom dark energy : @xmath70 ( panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] ) .",
    "we marginalize over @xmath23 in these ranges and also over @xmath24 accordingly .",
    "when we adopt the first prior , the allowed parameter range in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane occupies a relatively large region of an open universe as broad as for the case of the parametrization b with the intermediate transition redshift .",
    "the @xmath71 can be lowered by 3.9 compared to the cosmological constant case . on the other hand ,",
    "when we forbid phantom dark energy by adopting the second prior , the constraint on the curvature of the universe becomes more severe .",
    "as mentioned above for the result of the parameterization b , the dark energy model which allows a large region of an open universe has @xmath72 at present epoch and @xmath73 with an appropriate transition redshift .",
    "it is easy to see the parametrization c can realize these conditions since it has @xmath73 in the past by definition and we can tune the present value by varying @xmath23 and the transition redshift to some extent by varying @xmath24 . if @xmath23 is not permitted to go below @xmath66 , the fit for an open universe can not be as good as that for the phantom case , so the allowed region is limited in the neighborhood of a flat universe .",
    ".comparison of the 2@xmath0 constraints on the curvature of the universe @xmath52 for the parametrizations adopted in this paper ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : params ] for their definition ) .",
    "we also show the minimum @xmath67 values and best - fit parameters . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the similarity of the parametrizations b and c may be visually understood as follows .",
    "[ fig : w_evolution ] shows how @xmath4 varies with respect to @xmath9 for the parametrizations a , b and c. we choose parameters which give minimum @xmath67 for each parametrization , namely , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the parametrization a , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the parametrization b , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the parametrization c , as reported in table  [ tab : bestparam ] .",
    "the resemblance of cases b and c is apparent , especially as regards the transition redshift around @xmath81 .",
    "by contrast , parametrization a can not give rise to such a transition as its functional form only allows a mild transition around @xmath82 .",
    "we discussed the issue of the determining the curvature of the universe , considering several types of dark energy model , in particular ones with a time - varying equation of state .",
    "usually a flat universe is assumed when we give constraints on dark energy models .",
    "this assumption looks reasonable since it is often said that current cosmological data favor a flat universe .",
    "however , notice that when one does the analysis to constrain the curvature of the universe , a cosmological constant is assumed for dark energy in most cases .",
    "thus it is not so obvious how the constraint on the curvature changes when we remove the assumption of a cosmological constant for dark energy . in this paper , the constraints on the curvature",
    "are investigated without this assumption , using the recent sneia data of the gold data set @xcite , the cmb shift parameter from wmap3 and bao .",
    "we have analyzed three kinds of dark energy parametrization which are denoted as the parametrizations a , b and c here ( eqs .  , and respectively ) .",
    "the first parametrization a has been used in many literature since this is a simple way to include the time evolution of a dark energy equation of state .",
    "we have shown that the curvature of the universe is well constrained to be around the flat case when we assume the parametrization a , which has been already found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we reanalyzed this model using the recent gold data which include more sneia with high redshift @xmath83 and confirmed the results .",
    "then we have considered the parametrization b , which was also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where earlier data were used . in this paper , we have found that even if we include the new data from sneia , the general conclusion remains the same as the one drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite : for a dark energy model like the parametrization b with a particular transition redshift , the curvature of the universe is not so severely constrained to be around the flat case , but rather the allowed region includes a relatively large area of an open universe . in particular , we have discussed that some characteristic properties of dark energy are required for such a case .",
    "that is , an open universe tends to be allowed in a case where the equation of state for a dark energy is smaller than @xmath66 at the present time and approaches to zero at earlier time with a somewhat abrupt transition at a redshift in the range @xmath84 .",
    "the third model we considered in this paper was the one proposed in ref .",
    "one of the motivations for this parametrization is that it can accommodate the case where dark energy can contribute to the total energy density of the universe even at earlier time .",
    "thus we can expect that this model to have the same characteristics as the case with the parametrization b. we showed that , in this parametrization , the allowed region of the curvature of the universe , from current observations , also extends to the region of an open universe after marginalizing over the equation of state parameters in the model .",
    "we have explicitly shown that , for some models of dark energy , the curvature of the universe is allowed to be open .",
    "this may have many implications for the issue of the determination of cosmological parameters from observations .",
    "since we do not understand the nature of dark energy yet , we can not make any particular choice for models of dark energy with definite criteria .",
    "having this situation in mind , we should be careful when we constrain the curvature of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of a flat universe should be adopted with caution for some dark energy models if one would like to do the analysis from a general point of view .",
