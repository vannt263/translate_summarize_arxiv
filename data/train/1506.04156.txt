    "studies of the shapes of the velocity profiles of neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) offer valuable information about the kinematical properties and phase structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the shapes of hi velocity profiles requires careful analysis to avoid confusion between the intrinsic shapes of the profiles , data artefacts and effects related to beam smearing or major bulk motions .",
    "the knowledge of the spatial distribution , variation and radial properties of the shapes of the profiles are important to understand the inter - relationship between gas properties and energetic processes such as star formation . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we reported on the shapes of stacked hi velocity profiles , averaged over the disks of galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this paper investigates the shapes of the stacked profiles as a function of radius .",
    "earlier work has also reported on this .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite found radially decreasing hi velocity dispersions in the face - on galaxies ngc 6946 and ngc 1058 , respectively .",
    "@xcite analysed the hi emission spectra of 11 nearby spiral galaxies at a resolution of @xmath2 150 pc and found filamentary structures , forming a so - called _ high brightness network _ ( hbn ) .",
    "this hbn has a narrow line core with a velocity full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of less than @xmath2 6 @xmath3 , superposed on broad lorentzian wings having a velocity fwhm extending up to @xmath2 30 @xmath3 .",
    "the hbn contains about 60% - 90% of the total hi flux within the optical radius , @xmath4 , but becomes less dominant or disappears in the outer disk .",
    "a simple radiative transfer modelling of the hbn indicates that its kinetic temperature increases with radius .",
    "@xcite attributed the hbn to the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) phase of the ism .    in a recent study , @xcite analysed the hi profiles of 11 face - on and intermediately inclined galaxies from things , with the aim of understanding the physical mechanisms that determine the linewidth of the profiles .",
    "@xcite used second - moment values ( i.e. intensity - weighted standard deviation of line - of - sight velocities ) as tracers of the random motion of gas in the galaxies .",
    "these values decrease with radius from @xmath5 20 @xmath3 to @xmath2 5 @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite also reported that their sample exhibits a characteristic velocity dispersion value of 10@xmath62 @xmath3 at @xmath4 . by comparing the predicted energy input from different physical mechanisms with the gas kinetic energy inferred from the observed linewidth of the profiles",
    ", they concluded that star formation is the dominant mechanism that determines the width of the profiles inside @xmath4 .",
    "outside this radius , ultra - violet ( uv ) heating from extragalactic sources or magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) were proposed to be likely candidates that set the widths of the profiles .",
    "@xcite also analysed the shapes of hi velocity profiles in a sample of 23 galaxies from the things and the vla - angst @xcite surveys .",
    "they applied a similar stacking method as we did in our previous analysis but they used a different interpretation of the shapes of the profiles . by fitting single gaussians to the stacked profiles , they concluded that the profiles can be described by a central narrow peak with a velocity width of @xmath7 and wings to either side of the gaussian core containing @xmath8 % of the total flux .",
    "the wings were attributed to turbulence driven by star formation feedback , mainly supernova explosions .    in our previous paper , we constructed high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) profiles , called super profiles , by stacking individual profiles .",
    "we identified a sample of 22 galaxies from the things sample where systematic effects from beam smearing , major bulk motions or individual asymmetric profiles play no large role .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of this .",
    "the main results are summarized below .",
    "the shapes of the super profiles are well described by the sum of a narrow and broad gaussian components , with an average velocity dispersion of 7@xmath62 @xmath3 and 17@xmath64 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the super profile parameters ( velocity dispersions and mass ratios between the broad and narrow components ) correlate with metallicity and fuv  nuv colors .    here",
    "we extend this work by analysing the shapes of the super profiles as a function of radius in the 22 galaxies from @xcite . in section [ sec : sup_radius ]",
    ", we present the method and motivation for the analysis . in section [ sub : rad_disp_prof ] , we present measurements of the velocity dispersion as a function of radius . in section [ sub : comp ]",
    ", we compare our measured velocity dispersion values with those from the literature . in section [ sub : flux ] , we analyse the surface density of the single gaussian , the narrow and broad components as a function of radius .",
    "we give conclusions and summarize our results in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the shapes of hi velocity profiles are largely influenced by the local conditions within galaxies .",
    "energy from stellar winds , supernova explosions , and magnetic fields ( through mri ) , is constantly injected into the ism and its effect on the hi can be investigated by analysing the shapes of the hi velocity profiles . as the amount of energy from the ism can be different from one location to another within galaxies , the shapes of the profiles",
    "are expected to vary accordingly . here",
    "we will analyse the key parameters that characterize the shapes of the hi velocity profiles as a function of radius .",
    "these are the velocity dispersion , the mass ratio between the narrow and broad components , as well as their surface densities .",
    "gas velocity dispersion is an important parameter as it quantifies the amount of random motion of gas induced by different energy sources @xcite .",
    "this random motion provides pressure support and prevents gravitational collapse of the gas .",
    "thus , knowing the appropriate value of gas velocity dispersion is crucial for disk stability analysis .",
    "in an ideal case ( i.e. purely thermal energy injection , small beam size ) , the velocity dispersion is a direct tracer of the gas kinetic temperature . in practice",
    "though , other sources of turbulence can increase the linewidth from its purely thermal value .",
    "due to the lack of concrete knowledge about the appropriate value of the hi velocity dispersion , it has usually been assumed to be independent of radius . in this paper , we derive the hi velocity dispersion as a function of radial position for our sample galaxies .",
    "note that our velocity dispersions include both the contribution of the thermal and the turbulent velocity dispersion of the hi gas .",
    "in addition to the velocity dispersion analysis , if the narrow and broad gaussian components can be associated with the cnm and the wnm , then the super profile shapes can be used to study the relative amount of the wnm and the cnm as a function of radius .",
    "we fit the super profiles with a double gaussian function as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we also include results from fitting with a single gaussian .",
    "this will facilitate a direct comparison with previous estimates of hi velocity dispersion in the literature , which did not take into account the presence of multiple components in hi .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of the error analysis . in summary , we define the uncertainties in the data points of each super profiles as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rms noise level in one channel map , @xmath11 is the number of stacked profiles at a certain velocity @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the number of profiles per beam .    here , we investigate the shapes of the super profiles as a function of radius .",
    "we derive and fit super profiles within annular ellipses of 0.2 @xmath4 width .",
    "we use the optical radius , @xmath4 , as indicative of the radius within which star formation is efficient .",
    "we also include scaling by the radial scale length of the stellar light , @xmath14 , taken from @xcite and @xcite . in the following",
    ", we separate our sample into spirals and dwarfs following the definition by @xcite .",
    "therefore , galaxies with rotation velocities @xmath15 , stellar masses @xmath16 , and absolute @xmath17 magnitude @xmath18 are classified as dwarfs , whereas the more massive ones are classified as spirals .",
    "with this definition , our sample includes 12 dwarf and 10 spiral galaxies .",

    "this paper presents a comparison of the radial variation of hi velocity dispersions and surface densities of the components of hi in spiral and dwarf galaxies .",
    "spirals exhibit a clear radial decline in velocity dispersion , which can be well described by an exponential function .",
    "dwarfs show flatter or flat radial velocity dispersion profiles . on average ,",
    "though , we find that spiral and dwarf galaxies have similar hi velocity dispersion .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion profiles derived from single gaussian fits to stacked hi profiles ( super profiles ) tend to be flatter than those of the narrow and broad components , identified from a double gaussian fit to the super profiles .",
    "in addition , the single gaussian dispersion values approach those of the broad component at large radius , suggesting the broad component is dominant in the outer disks . in general , the velocity dispersion profiles in the outer parts do not drop at the same rate as the star formation rate profiles analysed by @xcite .",
    "we therefore confirm their conclusion that star formation is not the main drivers of the hi dispersions in the outer disk of galaxies .",
    "our measured hi dispersions are , however , somewhat smaller than the second moment values of @xcite .",
    "this is because second moment values are sensitive to the shapes of the profiles and therefore do not always reflect the velocity dispersions .    in terms of surface densities ,",
    "spiral and dwarf galaxies have similar radial behaviour .",
    "we find that , except in the innermost part , the surface densities exponentially decrease with radius .",
    "this decrease is steeper for the narrow component than for the single gaussian and broad components .",
    "the surface density ratio between the narrow and broad components also tend to decrease with radius . identifying the narrow component with the cnm and the broad component with the wnm",
    ", this indicates that the fraction of gas in the cold phase tends to be higher in the inner parts of the galaxy disks . on average , dwarfs have a lower surface density ratio ( @xmath19 = 0.4 @xmath6 0.3 ) than spirals ( @xmath19 = 0.8 @xmath6 0.3 ) , indicating that dwarf galaxies have a relatively lower amount of cold hi component than spiral galaxies . finally , we find that @xmath0 is correlated with @xmath1 , which we interpret as a correlation with star formation given the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath20 .",
