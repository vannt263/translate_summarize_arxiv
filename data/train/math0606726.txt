    ".  the fibers of this association coincide with the sylvester classes defined in @xcite .",
    "our construction is close to that used by reading in @xcite and the sylvester congruence on _ standard _ words is in fact a special case of cambrian congruence .",
    "nevertheless , we have chosen to give an independent exposition of the occurrence of the sylvester relations in the context of triangulations .",
    "this makes the paper self - contained and permits us to expose precisely the results which are required in our reformulation of the four color theorem in terms of signed permutations .",
    "this connection with the results of @xcite motivates an additional reformulation of the four color theorem in terms of the geometry of the associahedron .",
    "we also introduce colored triangulations obtained by associating a color ( considered as a letter of a totally ordered alphabet @xmath15 with @xmath16 colors ) to each face ( or to each vertex ) of a given triangulation of @xmath14 .",

    "when no condition is imposed on the flip , it is well known that the flip graph of the ( ordinary ) triangulations @xmath21 is connected and contains all the triangulations of @xmath36 in addition to signed flips , we also consider in this paper switched flips .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section @xmath43 is devoted to the combinatorial background on triangulations , colored triangulations and flip operations we need in the sequel . in section @xmath44 we introduce the maps @xmath17 and @xmath18 and prove that their fibers coincide with sylvester classes .",
