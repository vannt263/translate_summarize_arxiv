    "_ found that the correlation between two @xmath0he clusters adsorbed on opposite sides of graphene , @xmath10     apart from each other , was quite weak as evidenced by peakless pair distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "a weak correlation between two @xmath0he systems on the opposite sides of graphene was also predicted by gordillo s diffusion monte carlo calculations , which showed that the phase diagram of the @xmath0he monolayer on graphene would not be affected by the @xmath0he adsorption on the other side  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report pimc study of the @xmath0he adsorption on both sides of a single @xmath1-graphyne sheet . because @xmath1-graphyne is more porous than graphene",
    ", @xmath0he atoms can penetrate through graphyne to allow physical exchanges among @xmath0he atoms on opposite sides .",
    "this could result in stronger interlayer correlation than the corresponding systems on graphene .",
    "we find that @xmath0he atoms in a mott - insulating state form a 2d kagom lattice as a result of the interlayer correlation when the opposite - side @xmath0he layer is a c@xmath2 commensurate solid , a ferromagnetic state in a pseudospin terminology .",
    "effects of the interlayer correlation between two ferromagnetic c@xmath2 solids are found to depend on the substrate potential used ; the parallel and the antiparallel pseudospin alignments between two @xmath0he layers are nearly degenerate with the substrate potential based on the lennard - jones ( lj ) @xmath0he - c pair potentials while the antiparallel alignment is favored with the one described by the yukawa-6 pair potentials . the vacancy formation in a @xmath0he layer on @xmath1-graphyne",
    "is also found to be affected by the presence of the opposite - side @xmath0he layer .    in the following section , we outline our approach and some computational details .",
    "the pimc results along with the related discussions are presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in this study , a single @xmath1-graphyne sheet is set to be at @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0he - graphyne interaction is assumed to be a pairwise sum of interatomic potentials between the carbon atoms and a @xmath0he atom , which has been widely used to describe the interaction between a @xmath0he atom and a carbon substrate  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath0he - c interatomic pair potential , we employ two anisotropic potentials proposed by carlos and cole  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , a 6 - 12 lj potential and a yukawa-6 potential . for the computational convenience our previous study for the @xmath0he monolayer on bilayer @xmath1-graphyne was done with only isotropic parts of the lj pair potential .",
    "however , the original interatomic pair potentials of carlos and cole include anisotropic parts to fit helium scattering data from graphite surfaces .",
    "even though the inclusion of the anisotropic parts of the interatomic potentials has little effect on quantum phases displayed by the @xmath0he layer on one side of @xmath1-graphyne , it allows some @xmath0he atoms to be closer to the substrate , resulting in stronger correlation between two @xmath0he layers on the opposite sides ( the minima of the substrate potential made of the anisotropic pair potentials are deeper and closer to graphyne than the corresponding ones based on only isotropic parts of the pair potentials ) .",
    "this leads to our decision of using the substrate potentials based on fully - anisotropic interatomic pair potentials , which should give a better description of the interlayer correlation .",
    "furthermore , since the lj and the yukawa-6 potentials used in this study were based on an interaction between helium and @xmath8-bonded carbon atoms in graphite , we tested the sensitivity of our modelling of @xmath0he - graphyne potentials to the well depth of the pair potentials .",
    "although decrease in the well depth yields more fluctuations in @xmath0he density distributions , the density modulations are found to change only little and our main results presented below are still , at least qualitatively , valid .",
    "for the @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction , we use a well - known aziz potential  @xcite .    in the discrete path - integral representation ,",
    "the thermal density matrix at a low temperature is expressed by a convolution of @xmath12 high - temperature density matrices with an imaginary time step of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "while the isotropic parts of @xmath0he - c pair potentials along with the @xmath0he-@xmath0he potential pair potentials are used to compute the exact two - body density matrices  @xcite at the high temperature @xmath14 , their anisotropic parts are treated with the primitive approximation  @xcite .",
    "this is found to give accurate description of both @xmath0he-@xmath0he and @xmath0he - graphyne interactions with a time step of @xmath15  k. we employ the multilevel metropolis algorithm to sample the imaginary time paths along with permutations among @xmath0he atoms as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to minimize finite size effects ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied along the lateral directions .",
    "the pimc calculations were done with a fixed @xmath16 simulation cell with dimensions of @xmath17  @xmath18 , the same as in our previous study for @xmath0he on bilayer @xmath1-graphyne  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the interlayer correlation between two @xmath0he layers on the opposite sides of graphyne , which are either in a mott - insulating state or a pseudospin - aligned commensurate solid state .",
    "the results obtained with two different substrate potentials , the lj potential and the yukawa-6 one , are presented separately below .      for pimc calculations with the lj substrate potential , we first prepare the @xmath1-graphyne surface whose in - plane hexagon center is occupied by a single @xmath0he atom and whose lower side is coated with a monolayer of @xmath0he atoms constituting a c@xmath2 commensurate solid while each of the in - plane centers is occupied by a single @xmath0he atom .",
    "the simulations for the @xmath0he adsorptions on the upper side of the prepared graphyne surface begin from an initial configuration of @xmath0he atoms being randomly distributed at the distances far away from graphyne .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dden_lj ] presents one - dimensional ( 1d ) density distributions of @xmath0he atoms , as a function of the vertical coordinate @xmath19 along the direction perpendicular to the graphyne surface , for two different combinations of particle numbers per simulation cell .",
    "two distinct density peaks , which correspond to the upper and the lower @xmath0he layers , are observed on the opposite sides of graphyne .",
    "note that 36 and 48 @xmath0he atoms per simulation cell correspond to the mott - insulating density of 0.0706  @xmath3 and the c@xmath2 commensurate density of 0.0941  @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the additional density peak at @xmath11 corresponds to the zeroth layer consisting of @xmath0he atoms embedded onto the in - plane hexagon centers , which was also observed in our previous study for @xmath0he adatoms on a bilayer @xmath1-graphyne  @xcite . since the peak - to - peak distance between the upper and the lower layers",
    "is estimated to be about 4.8   , one can expect that the van der waals interaction between @xmath0he atoms on the opposite sides is weakly attractive ( note that the aziz potential we used for the @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction has a minimum value at @xmath20   ) .",
    "in addition , the clear separation between the adjacent density peaks in figure  [ fig:1dden_lj ] suggests that exchange couplings among @xmath0he atoms in different layers are nearly absent and any correlation between the upper and the lower layers , if it exists , should stem mostly from the weakly - attractive @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction rather than particle exchanges .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dden_lj ] shows two - dimensional ( 2d ) density distributions of the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms , while the lower - layer density peaks represented by the white stars constitute a c@xmath2 commensurate structure with all pseudospins being in the spin - up state ( see fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "a distinct density peak in each plot represents an occupancy of a single @xmath0he atom . at an areal density of 0.0706  @xmath3 , every hexagonal cell of graphyne",
    "is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) to accommodate three upper - layer @xmath0he atoms , which is a manifestation of a mott - insulating state . without the lower @xmath0he layer in a pseudospin - aligned commensurate solid state",
    ", this mott - insulating state is a nonmagnetic spin liquid of frustrated antiferromagnets in terms of pseudospin degrees of freedom ( see fig .",
    "2(d ) in ref .",
    "however , in the presence of the pseudospin - aligned lower @xmath0he layer , the upper - layer pseudospins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) to be aligned in the same direction as the lower - layer ones .",
    "our pimc simulations at @xmath21  k have also produced the antiparallel pseudospin alignment between the two @xmath0he layers .",
    "this is understood by the fact that the parallel alignment is energetically favored only by @xmath22  k per an upper - layer helium atom over the antiparallel alignment , _",
    "i.e. _ , two pseudospin alignments are nearly degenerate .",
    "we here note that the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms in a pseudospin - aligned mott insulating state of fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) constitute a 2d kagom lattice .",
    "this is also true when the upper - layer pseudospins are aligned in the opposite direction to the lower - layer ones .",
    "therefore one can conclude that as a result of the interlayer correlation , the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms form a kagom lattice structure at the mott insulating density of @xmath23  @xmath3 when the lower @xmath0he atoms constitute a pseudospin - aligned c@xmath2 commensurate solid .",
    "the interlayer correlation between two ferromagnetic c@xmath2 commensurate solids is also analyzed .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dden_lj](b ) presents the 2d density distribution of the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms at the areal density of @xmath24  @xmath3 , where they constitute a 4/3 commensurate solid .",
    "the upper - layer pseudospins are seen to be aligned in the same direction as the lower - layer ones .",
    "similarly to the case of the mott - insulating state , the antiparallel pseudospin alignment was also observed in our simulations .",
    "these two pseudospin alignments are more degenerate ( the parallel alignment was found to be preferred by @xmath25  k per upper - layer @xmath0he atom ) , than the parallel and antiparallel pseudospin alignments between a mott - insulator and a c@xmath2 solid in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that unlike @xmath0he atoms inside a hexagonal cell , upper - layer @xmath0he atoms at the vertices of the graphyne hexagons in a c@xmath2 solid state prefer the other sublattice sites over the ones occupied by the corresponding lower - layer helium atoms .",
    "we note that once a pseudospin alignment between the two 4/3 commensurate @xmath0he solids is established , either parallel or antiparallel to each other , energy barrier is too large to reverse one alignment to the other .",
    "now we analyze the effects of the interlayer correlation on the formation of vacancies especially in a mott insulator with the kagom lattice structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : vac_lj ] shows the 2d density distribution of 35 upper - layer @xmath0he atoms , one less than the mott - insulating case , per @xmath16 simulation cell .",
    "so the upper - layer mott insulator contains one vacancy per simulation cell while the lower @xmath0he layer is the same 4/3 commensurate solid as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) .",
    "one can see that every hexagonal cell , except one , is seen to accommodate three upper - layer @xmath0he atoms and its pseudospin is aligned in the same direction as those of the ferromagnetic lower layer . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vac_lj ] , one cell involving only two upper - layer atoms does not show the clear pseudospin alignment .",
    "this tells us that the kagom lattice structure is sustained even with the creation of vacancies but those isolated vacancies are restricted at one triangle of this trihexagonal tiling structure without hopping to the neighboring sites because of high potential barrier provided by the graphyne surface .",
    "our pimc simulations with the yukawa-6 substrate potential start from an initial configuration of @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath0he atoms being distributed randomly on the upper and the lower side of @xmath1-graphyne , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dden_yu ] presents the 1d @xmath0he density distributions as a function of the vertical coordinate @xmath19 for two different values of @xmath26 while @xmath27 is fixed to 48 per @xmath16 simulation cell . unlike fig .",
    "[ fig:1dden_lj ] for the lj substrate potential , only two density peaks on the opposite sides of graphyne are observed without the zeroth layer consisting of @xmath0he atoms embedded onto the in - plane hexagon centers .",
    "the absence of the zeroth @xmath0he layer is attributed to the fact that the yukawa-6 substrate potential is more slowly varying near the potential minima , that is , the hexagon centers , than the lj substrate potential .",
    "note that the yukawa-6 @xmath0he - c pair potential is less repulsive at short distances than the lj interatomic pair potential  @xcite .",
    "the distance between two density peaks is @xmath28   , shorter than the corresponding distance for the lj substrate potential .",
    "furthermore , there is significant overlap between the two density peaks that are broader than those in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dden_lj ] .",
    "this indicates large quantum fluctuations of @xmath0he adatoms along the vertical direction , which could result in frequent particle exchanges between these two layers .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dden_yu ] shows 2d density distributions of the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms , while the lower - layer density peaks are represented by the white stars . even with the yukawa-6 substrate potential , the lower @xmath0he layer is seen to constitute a pseudospin - aligned a c@xmath2 commensurate solid at the areal density of 0.0941  @xmath3 .",
    "this provides another confirmation to the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that most of quantum phases manifested in the @xmath0he monolayer on the @xmath1-graphyne surface , such as a mott insulator , commensurate solids , and pseudospin degrees of freedom , are not sensitive to the specifics of the substrate potential but are determined mostly by the surface geometry .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_yu](a ) that the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms under the yukawa-6 substrate potential are in a mott - insulating state at the areal density of @xmath23  @xmath3 with each hexagonal cell accommodating three @xmath0he atoms . unlike fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_lj](a ) , however , all upper - layer pseudospins are aligned in the opposite direction to those of the ferromagnetic lower - layer commensurate solid .",
    "we understand that the increase in the effective hard - core radii of @xmath0he adatoms due to larger quantum fluctuations , along with a shorter interlayer distance , causes the antiparallel pseudospin alignment to be favored under the yukawa-6 substrate potential .",
    "as observed with the lj substrate potential , the upper - layer @xmath0he adatoms in the pseudospin - aligned mott insulating state constitute a 2d kagom lattice structure . the interlayer correlation that favors the antiparallel pseudospin alignment is more evident between two ferromagnetic c@xmath2 solids .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dden_yu](b ) that the pseudospins of a upper - layer 4/3 commensurate solid are in spin - down state while the lower - layer pseudospins are in spin - up state .",
    "this antiparallel pseudospin alignment between the two @xmath0he adlayers corresponds to the ab stacking of two triangular solids .",
    "so we conclude that with the yukawa-6 substrate potential , the ab stacking is preferred to the aa stacking between two c@xmath2 triangular @xmath0he solids while these two stacking orders are nearly degenerate with the lj potential as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : lj ] .",
    "we now try to create a single vacancy in the upper - layer mott insulator , _",
    "i.e. _ , the kagom lattice structure , by putting only 35 @xmath0he atoms on the upper side in our simulation . figure  [ fig : vac_yu ] presents the 2d density distribution of the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms along with the lower - layer density peaks of a pseudospin - up c@xmath2 commensurate solid .",
    "it is shown that there are still three upper - layer density peaks per every hexagonal cell , corresponding to a configuration of a mott insulator with all pseudospins being in the down state . however , one lower - layer density peak or one white star is missing at a vertex of the graphyne honeycomb structure ( see the bottom right corner ) , which prevents the lower - layer @xmath0he atoms from forming a perfect c@xmath2 triangular lattice .",
    "this suggests that when a single vacancy is created in a upper - layer kagom lattice , one lower - layer @xmath0he atom moves to the upper layer to form a perfect upper - layer lattice structure while a localized vacancy is created in the lower - layer 4/3 commensurate solid .",
    "this lower - layer vacancy is found at a vertex site on top of a carbon atom because it is a less favorable site for a @xmath0he adatom than a site inside a hexagonal cell .",
    "the layer - to - layer hopping of a vacancy can be understood by a short interlayer distance and large quantum fluctuations along the vertical direction under the yukawa-6 substrate potential .",
    "according to our pimc calculations of using two different @xmath0he - substrate potentials , @xmath0he atoms form distinct layers on both sides of a single @xmath1-graphyne sheet .",
    "regardless of the substrate potential used , the upper - layer @xmath0he atoms form a 2d kagom structure at the mott - insulating density of 0.0706  @xmath3 as a result of the interlayer correlation when the lower layer is a pseudospin - aligned c@xmath2 commensurate solid .",
    "since the interaction of @xmath29he atoms with a substrate or between themselves is similar to the corresponding interaction for @xmath0he , the same kagom lattice structure is expected to be formed in the fermionic counterpart of the upper @xmath0he layer , _",
    "i.e. _ , a @xmath29he upper layer adsorbed on @xmath1-graphyne , when its lower side is coated with the c@xmath2 commensurate helium solid .",
    "we speculate that some novel phenomena related with a geometrically - frustrated antiferromagnetism such as quantum spin liquids  @xcite , could emerge in this @xmath29he kagom lattice .    the interlayer correlation results in different stacking orders between two c@xmath2 commensurate triangular solids on the opposite sides of graphyne , depending on the substrate potential ; with the yukawa-6 potential",
    ", the ab stacking ( an antiparallel pseudospin alignment between two @xmath0he solids ) is found to be favored but both aa ( a parallel pseudospin alignment ) and ab stacking configurations are nearly degenerate with the lj substrate potential .",
    "this is attributed to the difference between two substrate potentials in the interlayer distance as well as in the magnitude of quantum fluctuations along the vertical direction .",
    "a more accurate @xmath0he - graphyne potential would be required to draw a definite conclusion about the preferred stacking order of two commensurate triangular @xmath0he solids on the opposite sides of @xmath1-graphyne .",
    "recent theoretical studies done by marki _ et  al . _  @xcite and gordillo  @xcite reported that the interlayer correlation between two @xmath0he systems adsorbed on both sides of graphene was very weak and quantum phase diagram of one @xmath0he layer would not be affected by the presence of the opposite - side @xmath0he layer . on the other hand ,",
    "our pimc calculations have revealed some significant effects of the interlayer correlation on the structural properties of the @xmath0he monolayers on @xmath1-graphyne .",
