    "the maximum of this intraband continuum is close to the energy of @xmath15 phonon and its temperature behavior is related to the phonon self - energy trend .",

    "however , it is not possible to describe a line narrowing at low temperatures for q @xmath47 [ 00@xmath48 direction upon excitation at 647 nm .",

    "temperature behavior of the phonon parameters depends on the direction of probed wave vector which .",
    "the lowest anisotropy was found in titanium , where the frequencies for q - directions practically coincide .",
    "found q - dependences imply the contribution of the intraband electronic transitions to the observed effects .",
    "the proposed explanation of these effects is based on the account of electron spectrum renormalization due to carrier scattering by phonons .",
    "the main contribution to the narrowing of the phonon lines is due to the increase of the electron relaxation rate with increasing temperature .",
    "this leads to a decrease the time during which the electron moves in phase with the phonon and interacts effectively with it in the adiabatic region of the spectrum . otherwise , in the na region the phonon damping increases at intermediate temperatures due to a decrease of the electron lifetime .",
    "interplay of these mechanisms sometimes results in a non - monotonic temperature behavior of the total phonon widths .",
    "possible reasons for discrepancies between the experimental and calculated results may be inaccuracies in the calculations of the fermi surface shape and the distribution of electron velocities on it .",
    "in addition , a rough calculation using the isotropic renormalization of the electron spectrum and the same matrix elements of electron - phonon interaction for all fermi surface sheets , may not produce the subtle features in the behavior of the phonon self - energies .",
    "nevertheless , overall decrease of the frequencies and linewidths upon transition to shorter excitation wavelength in os was reproduced in calculations .",
    "there are two additional unaccounted effects which could distort the calculated spectral functions for all metals .",
    "one of them is the neglecting of the influence of screening in the case of longitudinal phonons for the momentum direction along [ @xmath640 ] .",
    "the point group @xmath72 of a hcp crystal leads to first - order raman activity for only one doubly degenerate zone - center optical phonon mode of @xmath15 symmetry . in this vibration ,",
    "two sublattices undergo opposite displacements in the @xmath73- and @xmath74-directions of the basal plane . for small finite wavevector along the [ 00@xmath48 direction ( measurements from ( 0001 ) surface )",
    "the doubly degenerate transverse phonon is probed , while the longitudinal mode in [ @xmath640 ] direction and the transverse mode in [ @xmath6500 ] direction may be studied in measurements from ( 1010 ) and ( 1210 ) planes .",
    "it is possible that the difference in low - temperature phonon frequencies for different q in the basal plane in os and ru ( see figs.6 - 8 ) is associated with this effect .",
    "the second unaccounted effect is associated with a possible line shape change of the phonon lines due to the fano interference with the electronic continuum .    in all performed calculations",
    "we did not take into account another possible sources of phonon softening with increasing temperature which are thermal expansion and higher anharmonic processes .",
    "estimates made show the thermal expansion effects do not exceed 10% of the observed phonon softening in all investigated metals .",
    "some anharmonic contributions to the phonon damping and energy were observed in ti at @xmath75 300  k ; no linewidth broadening was found in ru and os up to 800  k. therefore , we believe that the main part of the temperature changes in phonon self - energies are associated with electronic contributions .",
    "we present new results on the temperature and momentum dependent optical @xmath15 phonon self - energies in five hcp transition metals .",
    "the comparison of experimental and calculated phonon spectral functions clearly evidences that the nonadiabatic effects in electron - phonon interaction strongly contribute to detected anomalies . according to our calculations ,",
    "the main part of the effects comes from the intraband mechanism . the contribution of the interband transitions still needs to be estimated . despite differences of experimental and calculated phonon parameters",
    ", we were able qualitatively ( and sometimes even quantitatively ) to describe the observed temperature behavior of the self - energies of the long wavelength optical phonons and their anisotropy for all investigated metals .",
    "though these effects amount to a few percent , however , they determine the temperature dependence of the phonon frequencies , which can be mistakenly identified with the anharmonic behavior .    as a general remark , the ability of a raman experiment to probe the nonadiabatic effects on the optical phonon self - energy requires a careful analysis of temperature dependence of phonon self - energies in metals and doped semiconductors to separate the effects of phonon - phonon and electron - phonon interactions .",
