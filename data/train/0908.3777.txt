    "the model of resonant two - level medium is studied actively for many decades ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this interest is caused , in many respects , by the possibility of ultrashort pulses generation which can be used in different fundamental and practical applications .",
    "the concept of the so - called dense resonant media implies the necessity of taking into account the interaction of an atom with local field produced by all other particles of the system . in other words",
    ", one has to consider near dipole - dipole ( ndd ) interactions which are characterized by the quantity @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the transition dipole moment , @xmath2 is the volume density of two - level atoms , @xmath3 is the rate of transverse relaxation , @xmath4 is the planck constant .",
    "nonlinear effects connected with ndd interactions become noticeable when the medium is dense enough .",
    "one of them , the effect of intrinsic optical bistability ( iob ) , was studied in details @xcite .",
    "it was shown that iob occurs when @xmath5 is greater than 4 ( in the case of thin films @xcite ) or even less ( if we consider propagation effects in extended medium @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon takes place in the steady state , while in pulse regime one can observe optical switching @xcite and soliton formation @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we also consider intensive light pulses , so that change of the population difference ( or inversion ) can not be neglected . to study pulse propagation ,",
    "the numerical solution of the maxwell wave equation was implemented .",
    "this allows to automatically take into consideration the processes of dispersion and diffraction which are usually ignored in the analytical approaches .",
    "the main attention in this research is devoted to discussion of the properties of a combination of a one - dimensional photonic crystal and a dense resonant medium under pulse operation .",
    "the stationary bistable response of such system was analyzed previously @xcite .",
    "it turned out that one can change and control such characteristics of bistability as hysteresis loop width and switching intensity by using photonic crystal . in the present paper pulse form transformation in such nonlinear photonic band gap structures",
    "is studied in comparison with the behavior in linear case . in particular , possibilities to compensate dispersion spreading in such system and control pulse properties by using another pulse are expected to be found .",
    "the paper is divided in several sections . in section",
    "[ basic ] the main expressions for description of the system considered are given , just as brief characterization of the numerical approach used .",
    "this methodology is then applied to obtain the results of the other sections .",
    "section [ coher ] is devoted to optical switching and pulse shape change ( compression and splitting ) under propagation in a finite layer of a dense resonant medium .",
    "in particular , the role of near dipole - dipole interactions is estimated .",
    "section [ pbg ] contains the calculation results for a single pulse in a nonlinear photonic crystal , such as possibility of dispersive spreading compensation .",
    "finally , in section [ 2pulse ] two schemes of controlling pulse intensity with another pulse are considered .",
    "photonic crystal is studied as an element which makes this process more effective , at least in the scheme of co - propagating pulses .",
    "let us consider radiation propagation in a dense resonant medium in @xmath6-direction .",
    "light interaction with resonant medium with taking into account nonlinear contribution due to near dipole - dipole interactions is described by the modified maxwell - bloch system as follows @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the population difference , @xmath9 is the microscopic ( atomic ) polarization ; @xmath10 is the detuning of the field frequency @xmath11 from atomic resonance ; @xmath12 is the rate of longitudinal relaxation ; @xmath13 is the light speed in vacuum .",
    "macroscopic electric field @xmath14 is expressed via its amplitude @xmath15 as @xmath16 $ ] ; similarly for macroscopic nonlinear polarization we have @xmath17 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath18 is the wavenumber , and @xmath19 is the background dielectric permittivity , assumed to be linear and dispersionless .    the system ( [ dpdt]-[max ] ) can be represented in the dimensionless form by introducing new arguments @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dimensionless amplitude of electric field ( normalized rabi frequency ) ; @xmath24 is the normalized frequency detuning ; @xmath25 is the ndd interaction constant which provides extra nonlinearity in eq .",
    "( [ dpdtau ] ) ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "numerical solving of the system ( [ dpdtau]-[maxdl ] ) is performed using the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method . the explicit scheme to solve eq . ( [ maxdl ] ) on the computational mesh @xmath28",
    "is given by @xmath29/a_2 , \\label{explom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the value of dielectric permittivity @xmath19 at @xmath32 .",
    "( [ explom ] ) @xmath33 stands for the finite - difference representation of the right - hand member of eq .",
    "( [ maxdl ] ) which describes nonlinear properties of the medium . for the case of the dense resonant medium",
    "it is @xmath34    polarization in the mesh points is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ dpdtau ] ) and ( [ dndtau ] ) . to solve them the well - known midpoint trapezoidal method is used . to set the boundary conditions we apply the tf / sf approach , when the full calculation region is divided into two subregions containing total and scattered fields respectively , and the so - called absorbing boundary conditions according to the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) method .",
    "this approach helps to avoid nonphysical reflections of the scattered field back into the calculation region @xcite .",
    "the calculation scheme considered is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite where it was used to analyze validity of the quasiadiabatic approximation for consideration of ultrashort light pulses propagation in a dense resonant medium .",
    "as it is known , the cases of coherent and incoherent interactions are distinguished by the comparison of the pulse duration @xmath35 with the characteristic relaxation times of the medium @xmath36 and @xmath37 , moreover , as a rule , @xmath38 . here",
    "we consider the coherent case when @xmath39 . in this section",
    "the values of parameters are assumed to be as follows : light wavelength @xmath40 @xmath1 m , @xmath41 fs , @xmath42 ps , @xmath43 ps , @xmath44 , and , if not stated another , @xmath45 .",
    "the pulse on the entrance of the medium has gaussian shape @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , in time intervals comparable with the pulse duration ( of the order of 0.1 ps ) the processes of incoherent relaxation can be neglected . under these conditions",
    "the system consisting of two - level atoms can demonstrate optical switching from the ground state to the excited one for the time of the order of the pulse duration @xcite .",
    "however , as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note , taking into account for the propagation effects ( hence , self - phase modulation as well ) not only changes the characteristics of switching , but also makes it difficult to qualitatively predict them without execution of rigorous numerical simulations in every particular case .    the calculation results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show that , at small values of the ndd interaction constant @xmath5 , the dependance of population difference on the pulse amplitude has periodic form . when the parameter of extra nonlinearity @xmath5 is increased , this strictly periodic situation is disturbed , inversion maximum being shifted towards greater amplitudes and even being reduced , requiring more accurate adjustment of pulse intensity .",
    "in addition , there is similar dependance on the layer thickness : strictly periodic behavior of population difference occurs only at small ( as compared with wavelength ) medium thickness .",
    "the difficulties of optical switching , noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , are connected with the features considered above , as they have analyzed the case of large values of ndd interaction constant . in our designation",
    "it corresponds to the values of @xmath5 of the order of hundreds and thousands .",
    "it seems not to be realistic : usually @xmath5 does not exceed several units .",
    "for example , for gaseous media with typical parameters @xmath47 erg @xmath48 , @xmath49 s@xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 @xcite one obtains @xmath53 . in the case of excitonic media possessing substantially greater dipole moment ( @xmath54 erg @xmath48 , @xmath55 s@xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath56 @xmath52 @xcite ) we have only @xmath57 .",
    "the dramatic increase of the parameter of ndd interaction is unlikely to expect . in the present paper",
    "we keep to this restriction , so the periodic behavior corresponding to small values of @xmath5 will be always valid .",
    "this implies that the effect of ndd interaction on pulse propagation in a dense resonant medium is not significant at realistic parameters .",
    "to directly ascertain this conclusion , one should compare the results of the calculations , when the term including parameter @xmath5 is present or absent in eq .",
    "( [ dpdt ] ) or ( [ dpdtau ] ) .",
    "it turned out that the results remain the same in both cases .",
    "it seems to be obvious , if we recall that the parameter @xmath5 amounts to several units ( at best , @xmath58 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the utterly small value of @xmath59 in normalized equation ( [ dpdtau ] ) .",
    "only when the ndd interaction constant takes on sufficiently large values , the contribution of this term becomes essential ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , while in stationary regime ndd interaction plays vital role in such nonlinear phenomena as intrinsic optical bistability @xcite , for coherent pulse propagation this influence seems to be negligible , at least for realistic values of parameters .",
    "since the influence of ndd interactions is negligible , one can estimate the period @xmath60 of the dependance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by using the commonly known concept of pulse area @xcite : @xmath61 the period @xmath60 corresponds to the pulse which returns atoms after excitation exactly into the ground state .",
    "the area of such pulse should be equal to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for gaussian pulse we obtain @xmath63 for the case considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) it is approximately @xmath64 . if amplitude of incident pulse amounts to an integer number of these periods , i.e. @xmath65 , @xmath66 , then in temporal behavior of population difference ( fig . [ fig3]a ) one can observe @xmath67 minima and @xmath68 maxima before it achieves a stationary level , in this instance corresponding to the ground state of the system ( @xmath69 ) . in turn , at @xmath70 @xmath68 maxima and minima occur ( fig . [ fig3]b ) before the medium becomes inverted ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , this final value of population difference after pulse passage is not stable , as far as relaxation to the ground state becomes apparent at longer time intervals .",
    "it proceeds the faster , the greater constant @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "obviously , incoherent relaxation does not have enough time to appear",
    ". therefore one can attribute this effect to nonlinear interaction of radiation with the resonant medium .",
    "moreover , this relaxation process should be apparent in spatial scale giving rise to nonuniform distribution of population difference along the layer thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the similar behavior also takes place at smaller values of @xmath5 , but significantly larger thicknesses of the layer .",
    "since the influence of ndd interactions is negligible , the formation of stationary pulses ( solitons ) of sech - shape can be expected . at the same time energy conservation ,",
    "area change and shape transformation ( from gaussian to hyperbolic secant ) may cause the pulse to become shorter and more intensive .",
    "however , this process is limited by diffraction and dispersion of light : pulse begins to spread as it propagates in the medium .",
    "this fact is the reason of occurrence of the length of optimal pulse compression . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it amounts about @xmath72 .",
    "note that , after reaching this first maximum , several other are observed : at @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]c ) .",
    "finally , at certain ( sufficiently large ) distance the pulse exhibits ultimate attenuation and decay ( fig . [ fig6]d ) .",
    "another important effect that can be observed in this system is pulse splitting into several components .",
    "the number of components depends on the area of initial pulse .",
    "for example , if the amplitude of the pulse is @xmath76 ( area equals @xmath77 ) , it undergoes splitting into two ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) corresponding to two @xmath62-pulses .",
    "the second ( low - intensive ) pulse retards more and more from the first one as they propagate in the medium .",
    "simultaneously both these pulses lose energy with distance due to diffraction and dispersion .",
    "as it was already stated , the changes of laser pulse characteristics under propagation in nonlinear photonic band gap ( pbg ) structures are of special interest in the present paper .",
    "the one - dimensional photonic crystal to be considered here is a sequence of two alternating layers with different thicknesses and background refractive indices ( further they are assumed to equal @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "the thickness of the first layer is @xmath80 @xmath1 m , while the second one , @xmath81 , is treated as a variable parameter which allows to change spectral characteristics of the periodic structure . the reflection spectra for different values of @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "they are plotted in the vicinity of the main wavelength @xmath40 @xmath1 m . the pulse amplitude in this section",
    "is considered to be equal to @xmath82 .",
    "light pulse propagation in photonic crystals , possessing strong dispersion due to periodic variation of optical properties , results in their spreading on large distances .",
    "as it is known @xcite , for materials with sufficiently strong nonlinearity , the competition between dispersion and nonlinear interaction leads to effective compression of pulses .",
    "these results regard media with kerr - type nonlinearities . here",
    "we consider some properties of the systems combining pbg structure with the dense resonant medium ( the value of the ndd interaction constant is @xmath58 ) .",
    "the first such system is a structure containing a defect layer in the middle of a sequence of alternating layers . the reflection spectrum of such system with the linear defect ( the refractive index @xmath83 is unity ) is shown in fig .",
    "the well - known feature of the photonic crystals with defects is seen : appearance of the defect modes , i.e. narrow spectral peaks in the band - gap .",
    "[ fig9 ] demonstrates the computation results of pulse transmission and reflection for linear and nonlinear defect layers .",
    "as transmission of the pbg structure increases ( as @xmath81 changes ) , the effect of nonlinear interaction on the pulse shape becomes stronger leading to more effective compression ( fig .",
    "[ fig9]e ) . as to reflected radiation ,",
    "there are several pulses , the first one being reflected directly from the photonic crystal layers .",
    "the others were reflected after interaction with the dense resonant medium .",
    "it seems to be more interesting to consider a variant when the layers of photonic crystal are nonlinear .",
    "[ fig10 ] gives the simulation results when the layers @xmath84 of the pbg structure are filled with the dense resonant medium .",
    "it is seen that use of nonlinear layers allows to effectively compensate dispersive spreading of pulse occurring in the case of linear photonic crystal .",
    "different values of the layer thickness @xmath81 correspond to different values of reflectivity of the linear structure for the radiation wavelength @xmath40 @xmath1 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "naturally , more intensive transmitted pulse is observed for smaller reflectivity ( when @xmath85 ) . at the same time ,",
    "position of wavelength with respect to pbg spectrum influences on the duration of pulse transmission through the system : the smaller reflectivity of the structure considered , the shorter time interval required for the pulse to appear on its output . comparing transmission durations in fig .",
    "[ fig10]a - c , one can note that radiation needs only about @xmath86 for @xmath85 @xmath1 m , while for @xmath87 @xmath1 m ( the largest reflectivity ) this pulse delay is equal to @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we consider another system when both layers of photonic crystal are nonlinear . on the whole , the behavior of the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) remains approximately the same as in previous case .",
    "the maximal change occurs for the pulse at @xmath87 @xmath1 m : the peak intensity decreases , while the time delay increases .",
    "note that at @xmath85 @xmath1 m the effective splitting of the pulse is observed .",
    "it may be connected with the change of reflection characteristics of the nonlinear pbg structure under consideration .",
    "thus , interaction of light pulse with nonlinear pbg structure leads to effective compensation of dispersive spreading .",
    "on the other hand , using of photonic crystals allows to control intensity and time retardation of transmitted pulse .",
    "additional possibilities to control pulse properties are connected with use of a second one .",
    "let us consider `` one - by - one '' propagation of two short pulses and interaction between them via the dense resonant medium . as we have seen in section [ coher ] , the population difference depends on the amplitude of gaussian pulse in periodic manner at realistic values of parameter @xmath5 . in this",
    "section amplitudes will be expressed in the units of this period @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the behavior of the second pulse with amplitude @xmath89 differs according to amplitude of the first one @xmath90 and , consequently , the state of the medium after it has passed .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] . obviously , if the first pulse returns the medium to the ground state ( @xmath91 ) , it practically does not effect on the second one .",
    "but if after the passage of the first pulse the medium is excited , the second pulse can demonstrate significant increasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig13]b ) or decreasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig14]b , d ) of peak intensity .",
    "one can treat this effect as controlling of the second pulse intensity by using the first pulse .",
    "the thickness of the dense resonant medium turned out to be an important parameter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) .",
    "when the distance traveled by the pulse @xmath92 is @xmath93 or @xmath94 , the peak intensity of it appears to be greater in the case of the single pulse than in two - pulse scheme .",
    "but at @xmath95 ( when the single pulse demonstrates attenuation due to diffraction and dispersion ) situation becomes reverse . in general , it seems that the first pulse changes the distance of optimal compression of the second one .    in order to make the efficiency of control higher",
    ", the pbg structure can be used . for nonlinear layers @xmath84 ,",
    "more effective compression is obtained only when @xmath96 ( fig . [ fig16]a ) . however ,",
    "when both layers @xmath84 and @xmath81 are nonlinear , fig .",
    "[ fig16]b demonstrates increasing of peak intensities for all values of @xmath90 .",
    "for example , for @xmath97 it reaches approximately twofold growth in comparison with the single pulse case .",
    "the reason of this effect is that photonic crystal provides intense energy exchange between the first and second pulses due to reflections on the layers boundaries .",
    "the side effect is the difficulty of pulse separation on the output of the system .",
    "another scheme of controlling pulse intensity is connected with utilizing of counter - propagating pulse .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is the convenience of separation of pulses as they propagate in opposite directions .",
    "the calculation results for the pulse @xmath89 , which is controlled with the counter - propagating one @xmath90 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "it is seen that change of the intensity of the incident pulse @xmath90 leads to the change of the intensity of the transmitted pulse @xmath89 , in particular to its decreasing in comparison with single pulse case . since the change of the length of optimal compression occurs in this scheme as well",
    ", one can obtain increasing of the intensity of @xmath92 pulse on the distance of about @xmath98 when @xmath91 .",
    "[ fig18 ] shows that the interaction between pulses in the nonlinear photonic crystal is negligible , in contrast to the case of co - propagating pulses .",
    "it seems to be the result of weak coupling of the pulses in such system , as they propagate almost independently .",
    "this is the great disadvantage in the view of controlling possibilities , but it can be used for simultaneous work with two pulses moving in opposite directions .",
    "the consideration of intensive radiation interaction with the dense resonant medium in the case of coherent pulse regime allows to conclude that the influence of near dipole - dipole interactions can be neglected at realistic parameters of the medium , in contrast to stationary case . at the same time",
    ", one can observe pulse compression ( and splitting ) which has certain optimal distance due to the processes of diffraction and dispersion .",
    "this property of nonlinear compression can be used to compensate dispersive spreading in photonic band gap structure containing the resonant medium considered .",
    "it turned out that dense resonant medium allows to control pulse with another pulse in schemes of co- and counter - propagating pulses .",
    "it seems to be useful from the point of view of prospective techniques of optical information storage and processing .",
    "photonic crystal makes the process of controlling more effective , at least in the case of co - propagating pulses . for counter - propagating ones",
    ", it appears not to be efficient , nevertheless independence of pulse propagation in opposite directions can be used for parallel work with two pulses .",
