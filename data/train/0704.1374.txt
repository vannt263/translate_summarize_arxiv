    "during recent years there has been increasing evidence for a connection between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star formation in the vicinity of the central black holes .",
    "this subject forms the central topic of this paper , and is discussed in sections  [ sec : prop ] and  [ sec : staragn ] .",
    "a large number of studies have addressed the issue of star formation around agn .",
    "those which have probed closest to the nucleus , typically on scales of a few hundred parsecs , have tended to focus on seyferts  notably seyfert2 galaxies  since these are the closest examples @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion of these studies is that in 3050% cases the agn is associated with young ( i.e. age less than a few 100myr ) star formation .",
    "while this certainly implies a link , it does not necessarily imply any _ causal _ link between the two phenomena .",
    "instead , it could more simply be a natural consequence of the fact that both agn and starburst require gas to fuel them . and that in some galaxies this gas has fallen towards the nucleus , either due to an interaction or secular evolution such as bar driven inflow .",
    "one aspect which must be borne in mind when interpreting such results , and which has been pointed out by @xcite , is the discrepancy in the scales involved .",
    "agn and starburst phemonena occur on different temporal and spatial scales ; and observations are sensitive to scales that are different again .",
    "for example , star formation has typically been studied on scales of several kiloparsecs down to a few hundred parsecs .",
    "in contrast , accretion of gas onto an agn will occur on scales much less than 1pc .",
    "similarly , the shortest star formation timescales that most observations are sensitive to are of order 100myr to 1gyr . on the other hand , in this paper",
    "we show that the active phase of star formation close around a black hole is typically rather less than 100myr .",
    "correspondingly short accretion timescales for black holes are reflected in the ages of jets which , for a sample of radio galaxies measured by @xcite , span a range from a few to 100myr . in seyfert galaxies the timescales are even shorter , as typified by ngc1068 for which @xcite estimate the age of the jets to be only @xmath4myr .",
    "that the putative causal connection between agn and starbursts might occur on relatively small spatial scales and short timescales can help us to understand why no correlation has been found between agn and ( circum-)nuclear starbursts in general .",
    "it is simply that the circumnuclear activity on scales greater than a few hundred parsecs is , in most cases , too far from the agn to influence it , or be strongly influenced by it ( cf * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we redress this imbalance .",
    "while the optical spectroscopy pursued by many authors allows a detailed fitting of templates and models to the stellar features , we also make use of established star formation diagnostics and interpret them using starburst population synthesis models .",
    "observing at near infrared wavelengths has brought two important advantages .",
    "the optical depth is 10 times less than at optical wavelengths , and thus our data are less prone to the effects of extinction which can be significant in agn .",
    "and we have employed adaptive optics to reach spatial resolutions of 0.10.2 , bringing us closer to the nucleus . applying these techniques",
    ", we have already analysed the properties of the nuclear star formation in a few objects @xcite . here",
    "we bring those data together with new data on 5 additional objects .",
    "our sample enables us to probe star formation in agn from radii of 1kpc down to less than 10pc .",
    "our aim is to ascertain whether there is evidence for star formation on the smallest scales we can reach ; and if so , to constrain its star formation history .",
    "ultimately , we look at whether there are indications that the nuclear starburst and agn are mutually influencing each other .    in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the sample selection , observations , data reduction , psf estimation , and extraction of the emission and absorption line morphologies and kinematics . in  [ sec : diag ] we discuss the observational diagnostics and modelling tools . brief analyses of the relevant facets of our new data for the individual objects are provided in appendix  [ sec : obj ] , where we also summarise results of our previously published data , re - assessing them where necessary to ensure that all objects are analysed in a consistent manner .",
    "the primary aims of our paper are addressed in ",
    "[ sec : prop ] and  [ sec : staragn ] . in  [ sec : prop ] we discuss global results concerning the existence and recent history of nuclear star formation for our whole sample . in ",
    "[ sec : staragn ] we discuss the implications of nuclear starbursts on the starburst - agn connection .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the agn discussed in this paper form a rather heterogeneous group .",
    "they include type  1 and type  2 seyferts , ulirgs , and even a qso , and do not constitute a complete sample . in order to maximise the size of the sample",
    ", we have combined objects on which we have already published adaptive optics near infrared spectra with new observations of additional targets .",
    "source selection was driven largely by technical considerations for the adaptive optics ( ao ) system , namely having a nucleus bright and compact enough to allow a good ao correction .",
    "this is actually a strength since it means that 7 of the 9 agn are in fact broad line objects  as given either by the standard type  1 classification or because there is clear broad ( fwhm @xmath5kms@xmath6 ) br@xmath7 emission in our spectra .",
    "[ fig : bbrg ] shows broad br@xmath7 in k - band spectra of 3 agn that are not usually classified as broad line galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast to most other samples of agn for which star formation has been studied in detail , and avoids any bias that might arise from selecting only type  2 syeferts . that there may be a bias arises from the increasing evidence that the obscuration in perhaps half of type  2 agn lies at kpc scales rather than in the nucleus ,",
    "which may be caused by spatially extended star formation in the galaxy disk @xcite .",
    "such agn do not fit easily into the standard unification scheme ( and perhaps should not really be considered type  2 objects ) . because broad lines can be seen in the infrared , we know that we are seeing down to the nuclear region and",
    "hence our results are not subject to any effects that this might otherwise introduce .",
    "it is exactly broad line agn for which little is known about the nuclear star formation , because the glare of the agn swamps any surrounding stellar light in the central arcsec . as a result",
    ", most studies addressing star formation close to agn have focussed on type  2 seyferts .",
    "adaptive optics makes it possible to confine much of the agn s light into a very compact region , and to resolve the stellar continuum around it",
    ". the use of adaptive optics does give rise to one difficulty when attempting to quantify the results in a uniform way , due to the different resolutions achieved  which is a combination of both the distance to each object ( i.e. target selection ) and the ao performance . as a result ,",
    "the standard deviation around the logarithmic mean resolution of our sample ( excluding ngc2992 , see section  [ sec : obj ] ) of 22pc is a factor of 3 .",
    "however , this has enabled us to study the centers of agn across nearly 3 orders of magnitude in spatial scale , from 1kpc in the more distant objects to only a few parsecs in the nearby objects with the best ao correction .",
    "a summary of our observations is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "a description of observations and processing of the new data is given below .",
    "data for iras05189 - 2524 and ngc1068 were taken in december 2002 at the vlt with naco , an adaptive optics near infrared camera and long slit spectrograph @xcite . since iras05189 - 2524",
    "is nearly face on , there is no strongly preferred axis and the slit was oriented north - south ; for ngc1068 two orientations were used , north - south and east - west . in all cases",
    "the slit width was 0.086 , yielding a nominal resolution of @xmath8 with the wide - field camera ( pixel scale 0.054 ) and medium resolution grism .",
    "the galaxy was nodded back and forth along the slit by 10  to allow sky subtraction . for iras05189 - 2524 , 12 integrations of 300sec were made ; for ngc1068 12 integrations of 300sec were made at one position angle , and 14 frames of 200sec at the other .",
    "all data were reduced and combined , using standard longslit techniques in iraf , to make the final h - band spectrum .",
    "data for ngc7469 , ngc2992 , ngc1097 , ngc1068 , and ngc3783 were taken during 20042005 at the vlt with sinfoni , an adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrograph @xcite .",
    "data were taken with various gratings covering the h and k bands either separately ( @xmath9 ) or together ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the pixel scales were 0.125@xmath100.25  or 0.05@xmath100.1 , depending on the trade - offs between field of view , spatial resolution , and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "individual exposure times are in the range 50300sec depending on the object brightness .",
    "object frames were interspersed with sky frames , usually using the sequence o - s - o - o - s - o , to facilitate background subtraction .",
    "the data were processed using the dedicated _ spred _ software package @xcite , which provides similar processing to that for longslit data but with the added ability to reconstruct the datacube .",
    "the data processing steps are as follows .",
    "the object frames are pre - processed by subtracting sky frames , flatfielding , and correcting bad pixels ( which are identified from dark frames and the flatfield )",
    ". the wavemap is generated , and edges and curvature of the slitlets are traced , all from the arclamp frame .",
    "the arclamp frame is then reconstructed into a cube , which is checked to ensure that the calibration is good .",
    "the pre - processed object frames are then also reconstructed into cubes , spatially shifted to align them using the bright nucleus as a reference , and combined . in some cases the final cube was spatially smoothed using a @xmath11 median filter .",
    "estimation of the spatial resolution ( see below ) was always performed after this stage .    in some cases , the strong near - infrared oh lines",
    "did not subtract well . with longer exposure",
    "times this is to be expected since the timescale for variation of the oh is only 12mins . if visual inspection of the reconstructed cubes showed signs of over- or under - subtraction of the oh lines , these cubes were reprocessed using the method described in @xcite .",
    "standard star frames are similarly reconstructed into cubes .",
    "telluric correction and flux calibration were performed using b stars ( k - band ) or g2v stars ( h - band ) .",
    "in addition , flux calibration was cross - checked in 3  apertures using 2mass data , and in smaller 13  apertures using broad - band imaging from naco or hst nicmos .",
    "agreement between cubes with different pixel scales , and also with the external data , was consistent to typically 20% .",
    "there are a multitude of ways to derive the point spread function ( psf ) from adaptive optics data , five of which are described in @xcite . with agn , it is usually possible to estimate the psf from the science data itself , removing any uncertainty about spatial and temporal variations of the psf due to atmospheric effects .",
    "typically one or both of the following methods are employed on the new data presented here . if a broad emission line is detected , this will always yield a measure of the psf since the blr of seyfert galaxies has a diameter that can be measured in light days .",
    "alternatively , the non - stellar continuum will provide a sufficiently good approximation in all but the nearest agn since at near infrared wavelengths it is expected to originate from a region no more than 12pc across .    in every case we have fit an analytical function to the psf . since the strehl ratio achieved is relatively low , even a gaussian is a good representation .",
    "we have used a moffat function , which achieves a better fit because it also matches the rather broad wings that are a characteristic of partial adaptive optics correction .",
    "the psf measured for ngc3227 , which is shown in fig .  1 of @xcite , can be considered typical .",
    "if one applies the concept of ` core plus halo ' to this psf , then the gaussian fit would represent just the core while the moffat fit the entire ` core plus halo ' . integrating",
    "both of these functions indicates that about 75% of the flux is within the ` core ' , and it is thus this component which dominates the psf . in this paper , a more exact representation of the psf",
    "is not needed since we have not performed a detailed kinematic analysis , and we have simply used the moffat to derive a fwhm for the spatial resolution .",
    "the resolutions achieved are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the 2d distribution of emission and absorption features has been found by fitting a function to the continuum - subtracted spectral profile at each spatial position in the datacube . the function was a convolution of a gaussian with a spectrally unresolved template profile  in the case of emission lines it was an oh sky emission line , and for stellar absorption features we made use of template stars observed in the same configuration ( pixel scale and grism ) .",
    "a minimisation was performed in which the parameters of the gaussian were adjusted until the convolved profile best matched the data . during the minimisation",
    ", pixels in the data that consistently deviated strongly from the data were rejected .",
    "the uncertainties were boot - strapped using monte carlo techniques , assuming that the noise is uncorrelated and the intrinsic profile is well represented by a gaussian .",
    "the method involves adding a gaussian with the derived properties to a spectral segment that exhibits the same noise statistics as the data , and refitting the result to yield a new set of gaussian parameters . after repeating this 100 times , the standard deviation of the center and dispersion",
    "were used as the uncertainites for the velocity and line width .",
    "the kinematics were further processed using kinemetry @xcite .",
    "this is a parameterisation ( i.e. a mathematical rather than a physical model ) of the 2d field .",
    "as such , beam smearing is not a relevant issue to kinemetry , which yields an analytical expression for the observed data .",
    "of course , when the coefficients of this expression are interpreted or used to constrain a physical model , then beam smearing should be considered .",
    "mathematically , the kinemetry procedure fits the data with a linear sum of sines and cosines with various angular scalings around ellipses at each radius .",
    "we have used it for 3 purposes : to determine the best position angle and axis ratio for the velocity field , to remove high order noise from the raw kinematic extraction , and to recover the velocity and dispersion radial profiles . in all of the cases considered here ,",
    "the kinematic centre of the velocity field was assumed to be coincident with the peak of the non - stellar continuum .",
    "in addition , the uniformity of the velocity field permitted us to make the simplifying assumption of a single position angle and axis ratio  i.e. there is no evidence for warps or twisted velocity contours .",
    "we then derived the position angle and inclination of the disk by minimising the _ a1 _ and _ b3 _ parameters respectively ( see @xcite for a description of these ) .",
    "the rotation curves were recovered by correcting the measured velocity profile for inclination . we have assumed throughout the paper that the dispersion is isotropic , and hence no inclination correction was applied to the dispersion that was measured .",
    "the innermost parts of the kinematics derived as above are of course still affected by beam smearing . in general , the central dispersion can not necessarily be taken at face value since it may either be artificially increased by any component of rotation included within the beam size , or decreased if neighbouring regions within the beam have a lower dispersion . in the galaxies we have studied ,",
    "there are two aspects which mitigate this uncertainty : the rotation speed in the central region is much less than the dispersion and so will not significantly alter it ; and when estimating the central value we consider the trend of the dispersion from large radii , where the effect of the beam is small , to the center .",
    "for the basic analyses performed here , we have therefore adopted the central dispersion at face value .",
    "more detailed physical models for the nuclear disks , which properly account for the effects of beam smearing , will be presented in future publications .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that the impact of the finite beam size on the derived rotation curve does not affect our measurement of the dynamical mass .",
    "the reason is that , for all the dynamical mass estimates we make , the mass is estimated at a radius much large than the fwhm of the psf  as can be seen in the relevant figures .",
    "in this section we describe the tools of the trade used to analyse the data , and which lead us to the global results presented in section  [ sec : prop ] .",
    "specific details and analyses for individual objects can be found in appendix  [ sec : obj ] .",
    "we use the same methods and tools for all the objects to ensure that all the data are analysed in a consistent manner .",
    "perhaps the most important issue is how to isolate the stellar continuum , which is itself a powerful diagnostic . in addition , we use three standard and independent diagnostics to quantify the star formation history and intensity in the nuclei of these agn .",
    "these are the br@xmath7 equivalent width , supernova rate , and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "much of the discussion concerns how we take into account the contribution of the agn when quantifying these parameters .",
    "we also consider what impact an incorrect compensation could have on interpretation of the diagnostics .",
    "we model these observational diagnostics using the stellar population and spectral synthesis code stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this code calculates the distribution of stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram as a function of age for an assumed star formation history .",
    "we usually assume an exponentially decaying star formation rate , which has an associated timescale @xmath12 .",
    "spectral properties of the cluster are then computed given the stellar population present at any time .",
    "we note that the model output of stars is quantitatively similar to that from version 5.1 of starburst99 , which unlike earlier versions does include agb tracks @xcite . as discussed in detail below ,",
    "particular predictions of stars include , for ages greater than 10myr : equivalent widths of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and h - k color of 0.15mag .",
    "the equivalent quantities predicted by starburst99 v5.1 are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and h - k color of 0.2mag .      for small observational apertures a significant fraction of the k - band ( and even h - band )",
    "continuum can be associated with non - stellar agn continuum .",
    "the agn contribution can be estimated from a simple measurement of the equivalent width of a stellar absorption feature .",
    "we use co2 - 0 2.29  in the k - band or co6 - 3 1.62  in the h - band . although the equivalent widths @xmath17 and @xmath18 vary considerably for individual stars , the integrated values for stellar clusters span only a rather limited range .",
    "this was shown by @xcite who measured these values for elliptical , spiral , and star - forming ( hii ) galaxies .",
    "we have plotted their measurements of these two absorption features in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : equiv ] , together with the equivalent widths of giant and supergiant stars from @xcite .    in stars",
    "we use empirically determined equivalent widths from library spectra @xcite to compute the time - dependent equivalent width for an entire cluster of stars .",
    "results for various star formation histories are shown in the centre and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : equiv ] , for @xmath18 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "typical values are @xmath19  and @xmath20 .",
    "the dashed box in the left panel shows that the locus of 20% deviation from each of these computed values is consistent with observations .",
    "that the hii galaxies have slightly higher @xmath17 can be understood because these are selected to have bright emission lines and hence are strongly biassed towards young stellar ages  often corresponding to the maximum depth of the stellar features that occurs at 10myr due to the late - type supergiant population .",
    "it may be this bias for galaxies selected as ` starbursts ' , and the similarity of the co depth for starbursts of all other ages , that led @xcite to conclude that there is no evidence for strong starbursts in seyfert2 galaxies .",
    "similarly , an estimate of the dilution can be found from the nai2.206  line .",
    "fig .  7 of @xcite shows that for nearly all star formation histories the value @xmath21 remains in the range 23 .",
    "our conclusion here is that within a reasonable uncertainty of @xmath2220% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : equiv ] ) , one can assume that the intrinsic equivalent width of the absorption  most notably co  features of any stellar population that contains late - type stars is independent of the star formation history and age . for a stellar continuum diluted by additional non - stellar emission , the fraction of stellar light is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the observed and intrinsic equivalent widths of the co features discussed above .",
    "thus , we are able to correct the observed continuum magnitude for the contribution associated with the agn .",
    "our data cover both the h and k - bands  hence the reason for using both @xmath18 and @xmath17 . in order to homogenize the dataset , we need to convert h - band stellar magnitudes to k - band .",
    "the stars computation in fig .  [ fig : col_lum ] shows that this conversion is also independent of the star formation history , being close to @xmath26mag ( no extinction ) for all timescales and ages .",
    "this result is supported empirically by photometry of elliptical and spiral galaxies performed by @xcite . for ellipticals",
    "@xmath270.25 , and for spirals @xmath270.3",
    ". some of the difference between the data and models could be due to extinction since @xmath28 ; and for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "however , at the level of precision required here , the 510% difference between model and data can be considered negligible .    to convert from absolute magnitude to luminosity we use the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total luminosity in the 1.92.5  band in units of bolometric solar luminosity ( @xmath33w ) , and as such different from the other",
    "frequently used monochromatic definition with units of the solar k - band luminosity density ( @xmath34w@xmath35m@xmath6 ) .",
    "we then use stars to estimate the bolometric stellar luminosity @xmath36 .",
    "the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath32 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_lum ] .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath37 depends on the age and the exponential decay timescale of the star formation .",
    "however , the range spanned is only 20200 for ages",
    "greater than 10myr .",
    "thus even if the star formation history can not be constrained , a conversion ratio of @xmath38 will have an associated uncertainty of only 0.3dex .",
    "in general we are able to apply constraints on the star formation age , and so our errors will be accordingly smaller .",
    "graphs showing how the diagnostics vary with age and star formation timescale are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] .",
    "once the stellar continuum luminosity is known , an upper limit to the equivalent width of br@xmath7 asssociated with star formation can be found from the narrow br@xmath7 line flux . in some cases it is possible to estimate",
    "what fraction of the narrow br@xmath7 might be associated with the agn .",
    "this can be done both morphologically , for example if the line emission is extended along the galaxy s minor axis ; and/or kinematically , for example if the line shows regions that are broader , perhaps with fwhm a few hundred kms@xmath6 , suggestive of outflow . even if acounting for the agn contribution is not possible",
    ", one may be able to set interesting upper limits or even rule out continuous star formation scenarios , and put a constraint on the time since the star formation was active .",
    "this can be seen in the lefthand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] , which shows for example that for ages less than @xmath39yrs , continuous star formation scenarios will always have @xmath40 .",
    "we estimate the type ii ( core collapse ) supernova rate @xmath41 from the radio continuum using the relation @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the non - thermal radio continuum luminosity , @xmath44 is frequency of the observation and @xmath45 the spectral index of the non - thermal continuum .",
    "this relation was derived for galactic supernova remnants ; but a similar one , differing only in having a coefficient of @xmath46 , was derived by @xcite for m82 . for the 5ghz non - thermal radio continuum luminosity of arp220 ( 176mjy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it would lead to a supernova rate of 2.9yr@xmath6 , comfortably within the 1.753.5yr@xmath6 range estimated by @xcite based on the detection of individual luminous radio supernovae .",
    "this , therefore , seems a reasonable relation to apply to starbursts .",
    "we have to be careful , however , to take into account any contribution from the agn to the radio continuum .",
    "our premise for the nuclei of seyfert galaxies is that if the nuclear radio continuum is spatially resolved ( i.e. it has a low brightness temperature ) and does not have the morphology of a jet , it is likely to originate in extended star formation . at the spatial scales of a few parsec or more that we can resolve , emission from the agn",
    "will be very compact . as a result , we can use the peak surface brightness to estimate the maximum ( unresolved ) contribution from an agn . wherever possible",
    ", we use radio continuum observations at a comparable resolution to our data to derive the extended emission ; and observations at higher resolution to estimate the agn contribution .",
    "details of the data used in each case are given in the relevant sub - sections for each object in appendix  [ sec : obj ] .",
    "in addition , we exclude any emission obviously associated with jets , for example as in ngc1068 .    to use @xmath41 as a diagnostic , we normalise it with respect to the stellar k - band luminosity .",
    "this gives the ratio @xmath47 , for which stars output is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] .",
    "models indicate that the ratio @xmath48 of the stellar mass to k - band luminosity should be an excellent diagnostic since , for ages greater than 10myr , it increases monotonically with age as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : stars ] .",
    "however , in practice estimating the stellar mass is not entirely straightforward .",
    "in many cases it is only practicable to derive the dynamical mass",
    ". it may be possible to estimate and hence correct for the molecular gas mass based on millimetre co maps , but these are scarce at sufficiently high spatial resolution and are associated with their own co - to - h@xmath49 conversion uncertainties .",
    "we also note that it is often not possible to separate the ` old ' and ` young ' stellar populations .",
    "the best one can do is estimate the overall mass - to - light ratio , and argue that this is an upper limit to the true ratio for the young population . while there inevitably remains uncertainty on the true ratio ,",
    "the limit is often sufficient to apply useful constraints on the age of the ` young ' population .",
    "our estimates of the dynamical mass are based wherever possible on the stellar kinematics , since the gas kinematics can be perturbed by warps , shocks , and outflows .",
    "we begin by estimating the simple keplerian mass assuming that the stars are supported by ordered rotation at velocity @xmath50 in a thin plane .",
    "however , the stellar kinematics in all the galaxies exhibit a significant velocity dispersion indicating that a considerable mass is supported by random rather than ordered motions .",
    "thus the simple keplerian mass is very much an underestimate , and any estimate of the actual mass is associated with large uncertainties  see for example @xcite , who derive masses of spheroidal systems . as stated in section  [ sec : obs ] , we assume that the random motions are isotropic . our relation for estimating the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath51 is then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the observed 1-dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "we note that when taking rotation into account in estimating the masses of spheroids with various density profiles , @xcite also use a factor 3 between the @xmath54 and @xmath53 terms in their appendix b. despite the complexities involved , within the unavoidable uncertainties ( a factor 23 ) , their relation gives the same mass as that above .",
    "although this uncertainty appears to be quite large , it does not impact the results and conclusions in this paper since we are concerned primarily with order - of - magnitude estimates when considering mass surface densities .",
    "in the following section we bring to together the individual results ( detailed in appendix  [ sec : obj ] ) to form a global picture .",
    "it is possible to do this because all the data have been analysed in a consistent manner , using the tools described in section  [ sec : diag ] to compare in each object the same diagnostics to the same set of stellar evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "we note that the discussion that follows is based on results for 8 of the agn we have observed . as explained in appendix  [",
    "sec : obj ] we exclude ngc2992 because we are not able to put reliable constraints on the properties of the nuclear star formation .",
    "despite this , there are indications that at higher spatial resolution one should expect to find a distinct nuclear stellar population as has been seen in other agn .",
    "[ [ size - scale ] ] size scale + + + + + + + + + +    tracing the stellar features rather than the broad - band continuum , we have in all cases resolved a stellar population in the nucleus close around the agn .",
    "while this should not be unexpected if the stellar distribution follows a smooth @xmath55 or exponential profile , we have in several cases been able to show that on scales of @xmath56pc there is in fact an excess above what one would expect from these profiles .",
    "this suggests that in general we are probing an inner star forming component .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] shows normalised azimuthally averaged stellar luminosity profiles for the agn .",
    "these have not been corrected for a possible old underlying population , nor has any deconvolution with the psf been performed .",
    "nevertheless , it is still clear that the stellar intensity increases very steeply towards the nucleus . in 6 of the 8 galaxies shown ,",
    "the half - width at half - maximum is less than 50pc .",

    "they found that within 800pc of the nucleus , a region that includes the circumnuclear ring , the luminosity from young stars was @xmath138@xmath134 , about 70% of the galaxy s bolometric luminosity .",

    "the k - band datacube yields estimates of the upper limit to @xmath57 of 17  and 11  in 0.2  and 0.8apertures respectively .",

    "is close to face - on @xcite , it is not straightforward to make a reliable estimate of the dynamical mass . nevertheless , requiring @xmath160 to be high while @xmath57 is low already puts significant constraints on the star formation history .",

    "the radio continuum in ngc2992 is quite complex .",
    "much of the extended emission on scales of a few arcsec appears to originate from a superbubble , driven either by the agn or by a nuclear starburst . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the nuclear emission seems to be unresolved . with a beam size of 0.34@xmath100.49 , @xcite measured the unresolved flux to be 7mjy at 5ghz . at a resolution better than 0.1 , @xcite reported a 2.3ghz flux of 6mjy .",
    "based on this as well as non - detections at 1.7ghz and 8.4ghz , they estimated the core flux at 5ghz to be @xmath1666mjy .",
    "taking a flat spectral index , as indicated by archival data @xcite , one might expect the 5ghz core flux to be not much less than 6mjy , leaving room for only @xmath122mjy in extended emission in the central 0.5 .",

    "the western edge also exhibits high velocity dispersion . taken together ,",
    "these suggest that we may be seeing outflow from the apex of an ionisation cone with a relatively large opening angle .",
    "this interpretation would tend to support the hypothesis that the radio bubble has been driven by the agn .",
    "the stellar continuum appears to trace an inclined disk , the north west side of which is more obscured ( fig .",

    "this is similar to the 160kms@xmath6 reported by @xcite from optical spectroscopy , and suggests that we are seeing bulge stars . to analyse the radial luminosity profile",

    "the fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_rad ] were optimised at radii @xmath169  and then extrapolated inwards , convolved with the psf . whether one could claim that there is excess continuum in the nucleus depends on the profile fitted .",
    "the @xmath55 law provides a stronger constraint since it is more cuspy , and suggests there is no excess .",
    "although this evidence is inconclusive , fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_vel ] suggests that there is some kinematic evidence favouring the existence of a distinct nuclear stellar population .",
    "this comes in the form of a small unresolved drop in dispersion at the centre , similar to those in ngc1097 and ngc1068 . while the evidence in ngc2992 is not compelling , the dispersion is consistent with there being an equivalent  but fainter  nuclear disk on a scale of less than our resolution of 50pc .",
    "in general it seems that the k - band light we are seeing is dominated by the bulge , and we are therefore unable to probe in detail the inner region where it seems that more recent star formation has probably occurred .",
    "thus , although the available data suggest there has likely been recent star formation in the nucleus of ngc2992 , the only strong constraint we can apply is that continuous star formation in the central arcsec over the last gyr can be ruled out since it would require @xmath17015 .",
    "we therefore omit ngc2992 from the discussion and analysis in sections  [ sec : prop ] and  [ sec : staragn ] .      in ngc1097 , the first evidence for recent star formation near the nucleus was in the form of a reduction in the stellar velocity dispersion .",

    "direct observations of a spiral structure in the central few arcsec , from k - band imaging @xcite and [ nii ] streaming motions @xcite , have since confirmed this idea .",
    "however , some issues remain open , such as why there are three spiral arms rather than the usual two , and why gas along one of them appears to be outflowing .    our data , at a resolution of 0.25  measured from the h - band non - stellar continuum ,",

    "[ fig : n1097_prof ] shows that an @xmath55 law , typical of stellar bulges , with effective radius @xmath171  is a good fit to the stellar radial profile at @xmath172 .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to argue that at these radii it is only the gas that lies in a disk . in this picture",
    "the spiral structure in the stellar continuum arises solely due to extinction of the stars behind the disk . extrapolating this fit , convolved with the psf , to the nucleus indicates that at @xmath173  there is at least 25% excess stellar continuum .",
    "there could be much more , given that it coincides with a change in the dominant kinematics .    for ngc1097 we parameterized the kinematics of the gas and stars quantitatively using kinemetry .",
    "based on the uniformity of the velocity field , we made the simplifying assumption that across the central 4  the gas lies in a single plane whose centre is coincident with the peak of the non - stellar emission .",
    "we were then able to derive the position angle and inclination of the disk ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the 2d kinematics of the stars is traced via the co2 - 0 absorption bandhead , and that of the gas through the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission line .",

    "evidence for a recent starburst has been found by @xcite through optical and uv spectra .",
    "they argued that a number of features they observed could only arise from an @xmath181m@xmath1 instantaneous starburst , which occurred a few myr ago and is reddened by @xmath182mag of extinction .",

    "stellar kinematics from optical integral field spectra @xcite show evidence for a drop in the stellar velocity dispersion in the central few arcsec to @xmath200kms@xmath6 , inside a region of higher 150200kms@xmath6 dispersion ( presumably the bulge ) .",
    "our near infrared adaptive optics data are able to fully resolve the inner region where @xmath60 drops , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1068_prof ] . as for ngc1097",
    ", the velocity distribution of the stars was derived through kinemetry , again making use of the uniformity of the stellar velocity field to justify the simplifying assumption that the position angle and inclination do not change significantly in the central 4 .",
    "the derived inclination of @xmath201 and position angle of @xmath202 are quantitatively similar to those found by other authors in the central few to tens of arcseconds @xcite .",
    "the uniformity of the stellar kinematics is in contrast to molecular gas kinematics , as traced via the 1 - 0s(1 ) line , which are strongly perturbed and show several distinct structures superimposed .",
    "these are too complex to permit a comparably simple analysis and will be discussed , together with the residuals in the stellar kinematics in a future work ( mueller snchez et al . in prep ) .",
    "the crucial result relevant here is that at our h - band resolution of 0.10 we find that @xmath60 reduces from 130kms@xmath6 at 12  to only 70kms@xmath6 in the very centre . that there is in the same region an excess in the stellar continuum",
    "is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1068_prof_wide ] . here",
    "we show the radial profile of the stellar continuum from both sinfoni integral field spectra out to a radius of 2  and naco longslit spectra out to 5  ( 350pc ) . at radii 15",
    ", corresponding roughly to the region of high stellar dispersion measured by @xcite , the profile is well matched by an @xmath55 law , as one might expect for a bulge . at radii @xmath203   the same radius at which we begin to see a discernable reduction in the stellar dispersion ",
    "the stellar continuum increases by as much as a factor 2 above the inward extrapolation of the profile , indicating that there is extra emission . as for ngc1097 ,",
    "the combined signature of dynamically cool kinematics and excess emission is strong evidence for a nuclear disk which has experienced recent star formation .",
    "we can make an estimate of the characteristic age of the star formation in the central arcsec based on the mass - to - light ratio in a similar way to @xcite .",
    "because the stars appear to lie in a disk , we estimate the dynamical mass as described in section  [ sec : diag ] from the stellar kinematics , using the rotation velocity and applying a correction for the dispersion .",
    "the stellar rotation curve is essentially flat at 0.10.5 , with @xmath204kms@xmath6 ( corrected for inclination ) .",
    "we also take @xmath205kms@xmath6 , which is the central value and hence least biassed by the high dispersion bulge stars .",
    "these lead to a mass of @xmath206m@xmath1 within @xmath207  ( 35pc ) , and a mean surface density of @xmath208m@xmath1pc@xmath2 . correcting for the non - stellar continuum , the h - band magnitude ( which the behaviour of @xmath60 indicates is dominated by the disk emission ) in the same region is 11.53mag . for @xmath26mag ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] ) , we find @xmath209l@xmath1 and hence @xmath210m@xmath1/l@xmath1 . if no star formation is on - going , this implies a characteristic age of 200300myr fairly independent of the timescale ( for @xmath211myr , see fig .",

    "we note that this is significantly younger than the age estimated by @xcite primarily because their mass was derived using a higher @xmath60 corresponding to the bulge stars .",
    "the assumption of no current star formation is clearly demonstrated by the br@xmath7 map in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1068_maps ] . away from the knots of br@xmath7 , which are associated with the coronal lines and the jet rather than possible star formation",
    ", the equivalent width is @xmath212 .",
    "this is significantly less than that for continuous star formation of any age .",
    "thus , while it seems likely that star formation has occurred in the last few hundred myr , it also seems an unavoidable conclusion that there is no current star formation .    to complete our set of diagnostics for ngc1068 ,",
    "we consider also the radio continuum .",
    "this is clearly dominated by phenomena associated with the agn and jets , and our best estimate of the flux density away from these features is given by the lowest contour in maps such as figure  1 of @xcite . from this",
    "we estimate an upper limit to the 5ghz continuum associated with star formation of 128mjy within @xmath173 . however , converting to a supernova rate and comparing to the k - band stellar luminosity yields a limit that is not useful , being an order of magnitude above the largest expected values .      at near infrared wavelengths ,",
    "the agn in ngc3783 is remarkably bright .",
    "integrated over the central 0.5  less than 4% of the k - band continuum is stellar .",
    "in addition , the broad brackett lines are very strong and dominate the h - band .",
    "both of these phenomena are immediately clear from the h- and k - band spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3783_spec ] .",
    "however , it does mean that the spatial resolution can be measured easily from both the non - stellar continuum and the broad emission lines ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "we find the k - band psf to be symmetrical with a fwhm of 0.17 .    due to the ubiquitous brackett emission in the h - band we were unable to reliably trace the stellar absorption features and map out the stellar continuum .",
    "instead we have used the co2 - 0 bandhead at 2.3  even though the dilution at the nucleus itself is extreme .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3783_rad ] together with the psf for reference . at radii from 0.21.6  (",
    "the maximum we can measure ) the profile is well fit by an @xmath55 de vaucouleurs law with @xmath213  ( 120pc ) .",
    "as has been the case previously , at smaller radii we find an excess that here is perhaps marginally resolved .",
    "thus a substantial fraction of the near infrared stellar continuum in the central region is likely to originate in a population of stars distinct from the bulge .",
    "we were unable to measure the stellar kinematics due to the limited signal - to - noise .",
    "instead , we used the molecular gas kinematics to estimate the dynamical mass .",
    "as before , we used kinemetry to derive the position angle of @xmath214 and the inclination in the range 3539@xmath175 .",
    "this orientation is consistent with the larger ( 20 ) scale isophotes in the j - band 2mass image and implies that in ngc3783 there is no significant warp on scales of 50pc to 4kpc .",
    "a small inclination is also consistent with its classification as a seyfert  1 . adopting these values , the resulting rotation curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3783_rot ] . at",
    "very small radii the rising rotation curve may be the result of beam smearing across the nucleus . at @xmath215",
    ", the falling curve suggests that the rotation is dominated by the central ( @xmath216 ) mass , perhaps the supermassive black hole .",
    "we estimate the dynamical mass within a radius of 0.3  ( 60pc ) , corresponding to the point where the excess continuum begins and also where the rotation curve appears to be unaffected by beam smearing .",
    "taking @xmath217kms@xmath6 and @xmath218kms@xmath6 we derive a dynamical mass of m@xmath219m@xmath1 .",
    "the black hole mass of @xmath220m@xmath1 ( from reverberation mapping , @xcite ) is only 30% of this , and so can not be dominating the dynamics on this scale unless its mass is underestimated . with respect to this , we note that @xcite claim the statistical uncertainty in masses derived from reverberation mapping is about a factor 3 .",
    "alternatively , there may be a compact mass of gas and stars at @xmath221 .",
    "however , including @xmath53 in the mass estimate implicitly assumes that the dispersion arises from macroscopic motions . on the other hand , because we are observing only the hot h@xmath49 , it is possible that the dispersion is dominated by turbulence arising from shocks or uv heating of clouds that generate the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission ",
    "issues that are discussed in more detail by hicks et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "in this case we will have overestimated the dynamical mass .",
    "excluding @xmath53 from the mass estimation yields @xmath222m@xmath1 .",
    "we consider these two estimates as denoting the maximum range of possible masses . subtracting m@xmath223",
    "then gives a mass of stars and gas in the range ( 27)@xmath224m@xmath1 , implying a mass surface density of 17006000m@xmath1pc@xmath2 and @xmath2252.1m@xmath1/l@xmath1 .",
    "based on these ratios alone , fig  [ fig : stars ] indicates that the characteristic age of the star formation may be as low as @xmath226myr , although it could also be an order of magnitude greater . without additional diagnostics we can not discriminate further .",
    "we are unable to use br@xmath7 as an additional constraint on the star formation history .",
    "its morphology and velocity field are similar to that of [ sivi ] , and rather different from the 1 - 0s(1 ) .",
    "it shows an extension to the north which appears to be outflowing at @xmath227kms@xmath6 ( fig  [ fig : n3783_maps ] )  perhaps tracing an ionisation cone .",
    "since the br@xmath7 resembles the [ sivi ] , it is reasonable to conclude that it too is associated with the agn rather than star formation .",
    "thus the equivalent width of br@xmath7 ( with respect to the stellar continuum ) of @xmath228  represents an upper limit to that associated with star formation .",
    "the radio continuum in the nucleus of ngc3783 has been measured with several beam sizes at 8.5ghz . for a beam of @xmath229",
    ", @xcite found it was unresolved with a flux density of @xmath230mjy . with a smaller @xmath164  beam",
    ", @xcite measured a total flux density of 8.0mjy dominated by an unresolved component of @xmath231mjy . at smaller scales still of @xmath232  corresponding to 6pc",
    ", @xcite placed an upper limit on the 8.5ghz flux density of 7mjy .",
    "taken together , these results imply that there is some modest 8.5ghz radio continuum of 0.71mjy extended on scales of 0.31 .",
    "based on this we estimate a supernova rate as described in section  [ sec : diag ] of @xmath233yr@xmath6 , and hence a ratio @xmath234 . given that the unresolved radio continuum on the smallest scales is an upper limit , the extended component may be stronger and hence the true @xmath235 ratio may be greater than that estimated here .",
    "fig  [ fig : stars ] then puts a relatively strong limit of @xmath96myr on the maximum age of the star formation .",
    "this age is fully consistent with that above associated with our lower mass estimate .",
    "the value of @xmath236  above does not impose additional constraints , although we note that if the br@xmath7 flux associated with star formation is only a small fraction of the total then it would imply that the timescale over which the star formation was active is no longer than a few times @xmath80myr . therefore in the nucleus ( @xmath221 ) of ngc3783",
