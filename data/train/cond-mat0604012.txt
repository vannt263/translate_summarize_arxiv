    "the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method has been widely used for modelling of transient wave propagation in frequency dispersive and non - dispersive media @xcite .",
    "the existing frequency dispersive fdtd methods can be categorised into three types : the recursive convolution ( rc ) method @xcite , the auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method @xcite and the z - transform method @xcite .",
    "the first frequency dispersive fdtd formulation was developed by luebbers _",
    "et al . _ for the modelling of debye media @xcite using a rc scheme by relating the electric flux density to the electric field through a convolution integral , and then discretising the integral as a running sum .",
    "the rc approach was also extended for the study of wave propagation in a drude material @xcite , m - th order dispersive media @xcite , an anisotropic magneto - active plasma @xcite , ferrite material @xcite , and the bi - isotropic / chiral media @xcite .",
    "the ade method was first used by kashiwa and co - workers @xcite in 1990 for modelling of debye and lorentz media .",

    "<S> the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method is applied for modelling of wire media as artificial dielectrics . </S>",
    "<S> both frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion effects in wire media are taken into account using the auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method . according to the authors knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time when the spatial dispersion effect is considered in the fdtd modelling . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of developed spatially dispersive fdtd formulations is analysed through the use of von neumann method combined with the routh - hurwitz criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the conventional stability courant limit is preserved using standard discretisation scheme for wire media modelling . </S>",
    "<S> flat sub - wavelength lenses formed by wire media are chosen for validation of proposed spatially dispersive fdtd formulation . </S>",
    "<S> results of the simulations demonstrate excellent sub - wavelength imaging capability of the wire medium slabs . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the simulation domain is significantly reduced using the modified perfectly matched layer ( mpml ) which can be placed in close vicinity of the wire medium . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the reflections from the mpml - wire medium interface are less than -70 db , that lead to dramatic improvement of convergence compared to conventional simulations . </S>"
