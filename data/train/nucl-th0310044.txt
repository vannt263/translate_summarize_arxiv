    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions at 62.4 @xmath1 200 gev in the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , partons scattered with large @xmath2 become a valuable tool to study nuclear matter under extreme conditions . due to the large @xmath2",
    ", the hard scattering occurs early in the collisions , thus the scattered partons may directly probe the subsequently produced hot , dense and strongly interacting medium .    in collisions of elementary particles ,",
    "i.e. in the absence of a dense medium , the hard scattered partons typically fragment into two back - to - back jets of hadrons .",
    "these hadrons have large transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) and pronounced azimuthal angular correlations .",
    "the production cross sections can be calculated with perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) based on the fragmentation theorem and extrapolated to heavy ion collisions .",
    "theoretical studies predict that the hard scattered partons suffer a large energy loss by multiple scattering and induced gluon radiation as they propagate through dense matter  @xcite . unlike energy loss in qed , the radiative gluon energy loss per unit length @xmath3 not only depends on the color charge density and the momentum distribution of the partons in the medium , but also linearly depends on the thickness of the medium , due to the non - abelian nature of gluon radiation in qcd  @xcite .",
    "data from au + au collisions at @xmath4 = 130 and 200 gev have revealed rich information on high @xmath0 phenomena .",
    "one of the most interesting results is the apparent `` jet quenching '' in central collisions , observed as suppression of the hadron yield by a factor of 45  @xcite and hadron back - to - back correlation strength by a factor of 510  @xcite , compared to expectations based on the underlying nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the absence of these phenomena in @xmath5 + au collisions suggests that the observed suppression in central au + au collisions is indeed an effect of the dense medium created during the collisions , consistent with parton energy loss in the dense medium  @xcite .    both the suppression of the high @xmath0 hadron yield and the back - to - back angular correlations show a characteristic centrality dependence , which seems to be independent of @xmath0 for @xmath6  4.5 gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this @xmath0 range , particle production seems consistent with jet fragmentation , despite the suppression .",
    "specifically , experiments have observed :    1 .   an identical spectral shape compared to @xmath8 + @xmath8 collisions within systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "2 .   a similar suppression for charged hadrons and @xmath9 s  @xcite and for charged hadron , @xmath10 , and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "3 .   a @xmath12 ratio consistent with values observed in @xmath8 + @xmath8 collisions , indicating a similar particle composition in @xmath8 + @xmath8 and au + au at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "strength , width , and charge composition of near angle correlation consistent with jet fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 scaling of pion production cross section in au + au between @xmath4 = 130 and 200 gev is similar to @xmath8 + @xmath8 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the data suggest that high @xmath0 particles come dominantly from jet fragmentation in vacuum .    in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "energy is deposited in the overlap region between two colliding nuclei .",
    "the size , shape and energy density of the medium formed in this region strongly depends on the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "the amount of medium a hard scattered parton traverses , and subsequently its energy loss , varies with the centrality of the collision and also the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "if the parton energy loss is large , the surviving partons will be emitted dominantly near the outer layer of the overlap region  @xcite .",
    "the partons moving towards the surface ( near side ) traverse on average less material than those going in opposite direction ( away side ) .",
    "thus partons scattered to the near side are likely to escape with little energy loss , while the away side partons are likely to lose significant energy and thus are suppressed more strongly .",
    "it was shown before  @xcite that for a static non - abelian partonic medium , the mean total energy loss depends quadratically on the medium size .",
    "in addition , the  dynamical scaling law  allows to write the parton energy loss for an expanding medium in terms of an equivalent static medium with a linear dependence on the path length  @xcite .",
    "thus to the first order , one can decouple details of the energy loss formulation , which is complicated and model dependent , from the simple geometry of the medium .",
    "recently , several authors have modelled the energy loss of hard scattered partons in au + au collisions  @xcite .",
    "different theoretical approaches for the energy loss have been used and compared to experimental data like the nuclear modification factor @xmath14 , the back - to - back jet correlation strength , and the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production @xmath15 . in general ,",
    "reasonable agreement between the model calculations and experimental data can be achieved .    in this paper , we present a simple model of jet absorption in an extremely opaque medium , following the approach in ref .  @xcite that was used to set a limit on the expected azimuthal anisotropy due to jet quenching . the model is equivalent to an extreme jet energy loss scenario in which most of the energy is lost in a single scattering .",
    "we use this simplified model to focus on the geometric aspect of the jet propagation in dense medium . after incorporating a realistic nuclear geometry ,",
    "we demonstrate that the centrality dependence of the high @xmath0 suppression of the yield and of the back - to - back correlation strength can be described quantitatively .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity of our results on the jet absorption patterns and different collision geometry assumptions , and make predictions for the system size dependence .",
    "c    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     to guide our estimate of the beam energy dependence we assume that the matter density scales like the bjorken energy density . for an average mix of quark and gluon jets which we do not vary with @xmath16 , we fix the absorption coefficient @xmath17 to be the same as in @xmath18 gev . in this estimation the energy density increases by a factor of 2 from sps ( @xmath4 = 17 gev ) to rhic ( @xmath4 = 200 gev ) energies .",
    "interpolating between these values and scaling down the density in our calculation accordingly , we find that the high @xmath0 hadron suppression is still a factor @xmath193 for lower energy rhic run at @xmath4 = 62.4 gev .",
    "our estimation would also predict a factor of 2 suppression at sps energies , which is not observed experimentally .",
    "however , data at the sps  @xcite are limited to @xmath0 below 4 gev/@xmath7 , a region where other mechanism like @xmath0 broadening and hydrodynamic flow complicate the interpretation of particle production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we noted that the predictive power of our approach is limited , because we did not take into account the @xmath4 dependence of the quark ( gluon)jet fraction , the hard - scattering cross section and the system lifetime , which could be important .",
    "we have shown that the experimentally observed centrality dependence of the suppression of the hadron yield @xmath14 and the suppression of back - to - back correlation @xmath20 can be quantitatively described by jet absorption in an opaque medium when a realistic nuclear geometry is included . in our model ,",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath14 and of the @xmath20 are rather insensitive to the details of the medium density profile . @xmath14",
    "is also insensitive to the absorption patterns .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath20 do not distinguish between central collisions of small systems and centrality selected au + au collisions with similar @xmath21 .",
    "our interpretation is that @xmath14 and @xmath20 depend mostly on volume and average density of the opaque medium . in the limit of very opaque matter , @xmath14",
    "probably will not reveal further insight into the details of the absorption pattern or alternatively of the energy loss and the density profile , unless data at much higher @xmath0 become available .",
    "we find that observables like @xmath20 and @xmath15 are more sensitive to the absorption patterns .",
    "our model does not describe @xmath15 quantitatively unless an unrealistic nuclear density profile is used .",
    "this might indicate that the actual diffuseness of the opaque medium is smaller than expected from the density profile obtained by convoluting two woods - saxon nuclear distributions  @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that the real suppression is larger , and that the observed suppression is reduced by  soft ",
    "particles from dynamic mechanisms different from jet fragmentation , such as hydrodynamics  @xcite plus viscosity correction  @xcite , quark coalescence  @xcite , and quark / diquark pick up  @xcite . in this case , both the  soft  particles and a stronger suppression would lead to a larger @xmath15 .",
