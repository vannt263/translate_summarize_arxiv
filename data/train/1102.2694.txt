    "there are several ways to solve the singularity problem in cosmology @xcite , one of them is the bounce model @xcite . in the studying of the bounce model in pure general relativity ( gr ) @xcite , the scalar hydrodynamic perturbation can lead to a singular behavior of the bardeen potential .",
    "the further study @xcite show that the divergence of the bardeen potential can be avoided only in some models with special matter .",
    "another mode of perturbations must be considered is the vector perturbation .",
    "it is known that the vector mode will decay quickly in expanding phase of the universe .",
    "so it exhibits a growing mode solution in a contracting universe @xcite .",
    "this growing will in general lead to the breakdown of perturbation theory near the bounce .",
    "so , it is necessary to check the behaviors of the vector perturbations near the bounce .    generally speaking",
    ", the bouncing phase originates from a quantum effect of gravity .",
    "so it is interesting to study the bounce model in quantum gravity theory .    at present , the issue of finding a complete theory of quantum gravity is still open . in current approaches ,",
    "one of the most active is loop quantum gravity .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite is a mathematically well - defined , non - perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity . and",
    ", loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , a symmetry reduction of lqg to the homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , has achieved many successes .",
    "a major success of lqc is the resolution of the big bang singularity @xcite , this result depends crucially on the discreteness of the spacetime . instead of big bang , there will be a big bounce .    in gr",
    "bounce , the divergence of the bardeen potential occurs at two point @xcite , i.e. , near the bounce point and near the transition point of null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "the difference is that the lqc bounce is governed by a discrete quantum geometry @xcite .",
    "this will lead to some different behaviors of the bardeen potential .",
    "in this paper , we consider the behaviors of the perturbations near both the bounce point and the transition point of nec under the framework of the effective theory of lqc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ s2 ] , we give the framework of the effective theory of lqc with holonomy corrections , it can yield the bounce background . in sec.[s3 ] , we introduce the scalar perturbation based on the sec . [",
    "two models are analyzed in this section : one is the universe filled by a massless scalar field ; the other is a toy model which is radiation - dominated in the asymptotic past and future . in sec .",
    "[ s6 ] we discuss the vector perturbation near the bounce .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the canonical variables used in lqg are the ashtekar connection @xmath1 and the densitized triad @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 the spin connection and @xmath5 the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the spatial metric . for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe model ( frw metric ) , the ashtekar variables can be reduced to the diagonal form , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the basic canonical variables for the gravitational field are @xmath11 and for the scalar field @xmath12 . here",
    "we denote the background variables with a bar . in this paper",
    ", we consider only the flat space universe .",
    "thus the canonical variables can be expressed in terms of the standard frw variables as : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scale factor ; and the effective hamlitonian of the considered model is given by @xmath15 where the factor @xmath16 is called the barbero - immirzi parameter which is a constant of the theory .    in the process of quantization , we can find that there is no operator corresponding to the canonical variable @xmath17 itself but we can return to the holonomy .",
    "this fact can lead to the so - called holonomy correction in an effective theory of lqc .",
    "the effects of this correction can be obtain by simply replacing the @xmath17 to @xmath18 with the choice of , has been analysed by applying the higher order holonomy correction to the perturbation theory of cosmology , and the range of @xmath19 has been decided to be [ -1,0 ] . ]",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is a area gap , and @xmath22 denotes the planck length .",
    "so , the effective hamiltonian with holonomy correction is @xmath23 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p_{\\bar{\\varphi}}^2}{|\\bar{p}|^{3/2}}+|\\bar{p}|^{3/2}v(\\bar{\\varphi}).\\ ] ] from now on , we focus on a positive @xmath24 .",
    "the equations of motion can now be derived by the using of the hamilton equation @xmath25 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath26 and the poisson bracket is defined as @xmath27\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{\\varphi}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{\\bar{\\varphi}}}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_{\\bar{\\varphi}}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\bar{\\varphi}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this definition we can obtain two elementary brackets @xmath28 by using these brackets , one can derive two equations , i.e. , an effective friedmann equation and an effective raychaudhuri equation .",
    "however , in theory of perturbation , the use of the conformal time @xmath29 may be convenient than the cosmic time .",
    "the conformal time can be related to the cosmic time @xmath26 through the scale factor @xmath14 , @xmath30 .",
    "thence the effective friedmann equation and the effective raychaudhuri equation with conformal time are respectively @xcite , @xmath31 ^ 2=\\frac{8\\pi g } { 3}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{\\varphi}')^2+\\bar{p}v(\\bar{\\varphi})\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath32 ^ 2+\\bar{p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{p}}\\left[\\frac{\\sin ( \\tilde{\\mu}\\gamma\\bar{\\mathfrak{k}})}{\\gamma\\tilde{\\mu}}\\right]^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & = 4\\pi g\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{\\varphi}')^2+\\bar{p}v(\\bar{\\varphi})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the klein - gordon equation can also be derived as follows : @xmath34\\bar{\\varphi}'+\\bar{p}v_{,\\bar{\\varphi}}(\\bar{\\varphi})=0.\\ ] ]    from eq.([e4 ] ) and the relation between cosmic time and conformal time , one can get the motion equation of @xmath24 with conformal time @xmath35.\\ ] ] so , one can further define a conformal hubble parameter @xmath36 by @xmath37 moreover , we can also define @xmath38 ^ 2,\\label{e12}\\\\ \\mathfrak{s}_2&:= & \\mathbb{h}'-\\bar{\\mathfrak{k}}'-\\bar{p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{p}}\\left[\\frac{\\sin ( \\tilde{\\mu}\\gamma\\bar{\\mathfrak{k}})}{\\gamma\\tilde{\\mu}}\\right]^2.\\label{e22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be taken as two effective corrections to the evolution equations of the bardeen potential .",
    "this is because that one can obtain the classical evolution equations by taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 at the same time .",
    "we rewrite the eqs.([e7 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) in terms of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath36 @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the energy density and pressure of scalar field respectively .    by using eqs.([e11 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) , one can rewrite the eq.([e13 ] ) to @xmath46 where @xmath47    obviously , one can easily check that when @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and this means that a bounce occurs .",
    "the bounce density @xmath50 is related to @xmath51 which is the smallest eigenvalue of area operator , so this lqc bounce is originated from the quantum effects of spacetime .    from eqs.([e13 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) we can get a useful relation equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 thus , the relationship @xcite between the null energy condition and the stress - energy tensor can be written as : @xmath54",

    "the most straightforward way is to insert this approximate relation to eq.([e30 ] ) . however , this relation is only a asymptotic behavior corresponding to the case of @xmath86 , not the behavior on all time .",

    "there is another reason to choose @xmath92 that only @xmath92 can lead to a evolution equation of the bardeen potential which have analytical solution ( see eq.([e44 ] ) ) .",
