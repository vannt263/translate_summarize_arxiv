    "the theoretical investigation of classical spin systems has played a key role in the understanding of phase transitions , critical behavior , scaling , and universality @xcite . in particular , the claasical ising , the xy , and the heisenberg model are the most relevant spin models in three dimensions .",
    "each of these simple models represents a universality class which , apart from the spatial dimensionality and the range of the interactions , is characterized by the number of components @xmath3 of the order parameter , e.g , the magnetization in the case of ferromagnetic models . despite their simplicity these spin systems continue to be of high relevance within the framework of _ dynamic _ behavior near critical points @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the ising @xmath4 , the xy @xmath5 , and the heisenberg @xmath6 universality class can be extended towards _ dynamic _ universality classes , which in addition to their static properties are characterized by the set of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "special attention must be paid to the presence of energy conserving driving terms in the equations of motion which lead to propagating modes ( spin waves ) below the critical temperature and thus modify the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the discrete nature of ising spins does not allow such terms so that its dynamics is always of relaxational type ( see ref.@xcite for a complete classification ) .",
    "the simplest spin model which allows propagating modes is a particular version of the ferromagnetic xy model @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics here is characterized by a nonconserved order parameter which is dynamically coupled to a _ conserved _",
    "quantity ( see sec.ii ) .",
    "the presence of spin waves reduces the value of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath7 as compared to pure critical relaxation @xcite .",
    "the same is true for the isotropic heisenberg model for which the @xmath8 component magnetization vector is always conserved in the presence of energy conserving driving terms .",
    "if the model is ferromagnetic , the magnetization is the order parameter .",
    "however , for an _ antiferromagnet _ , the magnetization plays the role of a conserved vector which is dynamically coupled to the _ nonconserved _ order parameter ( staggered magnetization ) .",
    "this difference in the conservation laws causes the classical heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnet to be in different dynamic universality classes although they belong to the same static universality class . due to their fundamental role in the understanding of the critical dynamics in magnets",
    "heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets have been thoroughly studied analytically by mode coupling theories ( see ref.@xcite for a general overview ) especially in presence of dipolar interactions @xcite and numerically by spin dynamics in @xmath9 @xcite and in @xmath10 @xcite and by methods closely related to molecular dynamics @xcite .    the xy model may be viewed as a heisenberg ferromagnet with an easy - plane @xmath11 anisotropy such that the order parameter has only two components .",
    "planar ferromagnets are realized by layered compounds such as k@xmath12cuf@xmath13 @xcite and rb@xmath12crcl@xmath13 @xcite which almost act as two - dimensional systems .",
    "the best results available today have been obtained on cocl@xmath12 intercalated in graphite @xcite , where a crossover from two - dimensional to three - dimensional behavior in the correlations has been observed below the kosterlitz - thouless temperature .",
    "apart from the evident interpretation as a planar ferromagnet the xy model captures a larger variety of phenomena than the ising or the heisenberg model . despite its continuous @xmath14 symmetry",
    "the xy model undergoes a continuous phase transition at a finite temperature in two dimensions , known as the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite . rather than by the onset of long - ranged order",
    "the transition is solely characterized by a diverging correlation length , when the critical temperature is approached from above .",
    "due to a peculiar conspiracy between the spatial dimensionality @xmath9 and the number of spin components @xmath15 configurations of bound and free vortices dominate the critical behavior of the xy model , where the unbinding of vortex pairs marks the point of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "naturally , many attempts to describe the critical dynamics of the xy model in @xmath9 theoretically are based on the dynamics of vortices and vortex pairs @xcite . according to analytical and numerical investigations for the ferromagnetic case @xcite the in - plane component @xmath16 and the out - of - plane component @xmath17 of the dynamic structure factor",
    "are expected to have central peaks above the transition .",
    "the line shapes of these peaks are predicted to be squared lorentzian and gaussian , respectively . below the transition only spin - wave peaks are expected @xcite . to test these specific predictions",
    "much numerical effort has been spent on spin dynamics simulations of the xy model in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although dynamic finite - size scaling and the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath18 has been confirmed to a high degree of confidence @xcite , the measured lineshapes of @xmath0 @xcite are apparently not well captured by analytical theories ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is therefore instructive to measure @xmath0 for the xy model in @xmath10 for which configurations of bound or free vortices do not play any special role for the critical behavior and should therefore not provide particularly noticable contributions to the structure factor . in @xmath10 the dynamics of the planar ferromagnet has been investigated by mode coupling theory @xcite and specific predictions concerning line shapes and -widths have been made which can be compared with our data ( see sec.iv ) .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath19-transition of @xmath2he is the in the xy universality class , but the applications of the xy model for the physics of @xmath2he reach far beyond that .",
    "the spin dynamics for the xy model is the lattice analogue of the dynamical model e ( symmetric planar ferromagnet @xcite ) which _ asymptotically _ also describes the _ critical dynamics _ of @xmath2he near the @xmath19-line @xcite .",
    "if one therefore studies the transport properties of the xy model near the critical point @xmath20 , one should obtain lattice analogues of the corresponding transport coefficients of @xmath2he near the @xmath19-transition . in this respect",
    "the aforementioned conserved quantity plays a particularly interesting part , because it is related to the entropy density in @xmath2he and its associated transport coefficient corresponds to the thermal conductivity of @xmath2he @xcite which is an experimentally accessible quantity @xcite . below the critical temperature spin waves in the xy model then correspond to travelling waves of second sound in @xmath2he .",
    "these propagating modes cause the thermal conductivity to diverge at the lambda transition of bulk @xmath2he @xcite . in a finite system like our simulation sample ,",
    "one therefore expects critical finite - size rounding of the thermal conductivity , which can be studied in the framework of the spin dynamics simulation and which should also be observable in experiments .",
    "to what extent the spin dynamics simulation actually captures the critical dynamics of @xmath2he is a rather delicate question .",
    "although the _ asymptotic _ behavior is described by model e , the actual _ crossover _ to the asymptotic behavior , i.e. , the decay of _ nonasymptotic _ corrections is governed by the specific heat exponent @xmath21 @xcite , which is so small that the true asymptotic behavior will never be seen in a simulation . from the point of view of analytic theory",
    "this means that in order to capture the nonansymptotic effects present in experiments one has to replace model e by the more complicated model f @xcite . from the point of view of spin dynamics simulations",
    "this means that one has to look for sources of such nonasymptotic behavior artificially generated by the simulation method and other nonasymptotic corrections not captured by the model or the method ( see sec.ii ) .",
    "apart from these problems , it should also be mentioned that the dynamical model e has two renormalization group fixed points .",
    "one of these fixed points yields dynamic scaling with a single dynamic exponent @xmath22 in @xmath23 dimensions , whereas the other gives rise to a weak _ violation _ of dynamic scaling .",
    "theoretical arguments @xciteand experimental evidence indicate that the latter fixed point is the stable one for @xmath2he in @xmath10 , i.e. , the critical dynamics is characterized by two different dynamic exponents @xmath24 ( order parameter ) and @xmath25 ( conserved quantity ) which fulfill the scaling relation @xmath26 .",
    "their difference @xmath27 has the nature of a dynamic wegner exponent and is known as the _ transient _ exponent @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present the model and the simulation methods used to generate equilibrium configurations and to obtain the critical point of the model and its static critical exponents .",
    "furthermore , the equations of motion and the method used to integrate them numerically are presented . in sec.iii",
    "we briefly discuss the static critical behavior of our model and present an accurate estimate of the critical temperature .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to the discussion of the dynamic structure factor and the comparison with predictions of analytic theory . in sec.v",
    "we present first results for the lattice analogue of the thermal conductivity and discuss its scaling properties .",
    "a summary and prospects for future work are given in sec.vi .",
    "unless otherwise stated statistical errors quoted in this work correspond to one standard deviation .",
    "the system under investigation is given by a ferromagnetic heisenberg model with the strongest possible easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a nearest neighbor pair of spins on a simple cubic lattice in three dimensions .",
    "the lattice contains @xmath30 lattice sites in each direction and in order to avoid surface effects periodic boundary conditions are applied . each spin @xmath31 is a classical spin @xmath32 with the normalization @xmath33 .",
    "the easy - plane anisotropy in eq.([hxy ] ) is the strongest possible in the sense that the @xmath7-components of the spins do not couple , so that eq.([hxy ] ) looks like the standard hamiltonian for the usual ( plane rotator ) xy model .    as a starting point for the spin dynamics a sequence of equilibrium configurations",
    "is needed to provide initial conditions for the equations of motion .",
    "these configurations are obtained from a monte - carlo simulation of the model hamiltonian given by eq.([hxy ] ) .",
    "the monte - carlo algorithm chosen is a hybrid scheme , where each hybrid monte - carlo step ( mcs ) consists of 10 updates each of which can be one of : one metropolis sweep of the whole lattice , one single cluster wolff update @xcite , or one overrelaxation update of the whole lattice @xcite .",
    "the metropolis algorithm updates the lattice sequentially in the standard way .",
    "according to the detailed balance condition we choose the acceptance probability @xmath34 for a single spin flip , where @xmath35 is the change in configurational energy according to eq.([hxy ] ) and @xmath36 .",
    "the wolff algorithm also works the standard way @xcite , except that _ only _ the @xmath37 and @xmath38 components of the spins are used for the cluster growth .",
    "this means that a cluster update never changes the @xmath7-component of any spin so that the wolff algorithm is nonergodic in this case .",
    "our cluster update is still a valid monte - carlo step in the sense that it fulfills detailed balance , however , in order to provide a valid monte - carlo algorithm it has to be used together with the metropolis algorithm described above in a hybrid fashion .",
    "the use of wolff updates allows us to take advantage of improved estimators @xcite for magnetic quantities .    the overrelaxation part of the algorithm performs a microcanonical update of the configuration in the following way .",
    "the local configurational energy has the functional form of a scalar product of the spins , where according to eq.([hxy ] ) only the @xmath37 and @xmath38 components are involved .",
    "with respect to the sum of its nearest neighbor spins each spin has a transverse component in the @xmath39 plane which does not enter the scalar product .",
    "the overrelaxation algorithm simply scans the lattice sequentially , determines this transverse component for each lattice site and flips its sign .",
    "this does not change the local configurational energy @xmath40 and by virtue of the usual metropolis acceptance function @xmath41 the update is always accepted . along with this simple operation",
    "the sign of @xmath42 is flipped with probability @xmath43 at each lattice site which according to eq.([hxy ] ) also does not change the energy of the configuration .",
    "this overrelaxation algorithm is similar to the one used in ref.@xcite and it quite efficiently decorrelates subsequent configurations over a wider range of temperatures around the critical point than does the wolff algorithm .",
    "typically , we use three metropolis _ ( m ) _ , five single cluster wolff _ ( c ) _ , and two overrelaxation updates _ ( o ) _ in a hybrid monte - carlo step in the critical region of our xy model .",
    "the inividual updates are mixed automatically in the program so that the update sequence _ ( m c c m o c m c c o ) _ is generated as one hybrid monte - carlo step in this case .",
    "the random number generator we use is the shift register generator r1279 given by the recursion relation @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "generators like this are known to cause systematic errors in combination with the wolff algorithm @xcite ; however , for lags @xmath46 as large as the ones used here these errors will be far smaller than typical statistical errors .",
    "they are further reduced by the hybrid nature of our algorithm @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics of the xy model is defined by the equations of motion @xmath47 where @xmath48 ist the hamiltonian defined by eq.([hxy ] ) .",
    "one may interpret eq.([xyeqmot ] ) as the direct classical analogue of the heisenberg equations of motion for spin operators , where @xmath49 so that energies and frequencies are measured in the same units . from the symmetry of eq.([hxy ] ) it is evident that the components @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the magnetization @xmath52 are not conserved under the dynamics given by eq.([xyeqmot ] ) .",
    "note that the two - component vector @xmath53 is the _ order parameter _ of the xy model .",
    "the @xmath7- or _ out - of - plane _ component @xmath54 of the magnetization @xmath55 is just the conserved quantity within the framework of model e dynamics we have already referred to in sec.i @xcite .",
    "note that eq.([hxy ] ) is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath56 which is a symmetry required by model e.    for the comparison of the critical spin dynamics with the critical dynamics according to model e it is important to realize , that the configurational _ energy _ is an _ additional _ constant of motion , because eq.([xyeqmot ] ) , in contrast to the coarse grained model e , does not contain relaxation . whether energy conservation is a reasonable assumption for the dynamics of the xy model or any other classical spin model",
    "is a question of the time scales to be resolved .",
    "the most important time scale for our investigation is set by the propagating modes ( spin waves ) in the system and for these the configurational energy is indeed constant . within the time scale of the spin waves thermal averages",
    "can therefore be replaced by averages over the initial configurations from which the time integration of eq.([xyeqmot ] ) is started . for much longer times relaxation processes ( equilibration with the heat bath ) come into play which violate energy conservation and render our spin dynamics approach invalid . in the vicinity of the critical point energy conservation",
    "becomes particularly important , because the dynamic universality class may change under the influence of an additional conservation law .",
    "if model e is augmented by energy conservation ( model e , see ref.@xcite ) it turns out that the energy asymptotically decouples from the order parameter @xmath53 and the conserved _ out - of - plane _",
    "magnetization @xmath54 and model e critical behavior is restored .",
    "however , energy conservation may introduce corrections to the asymptotic finite - size scaling behavior @xcite which decay very slowly and may cause ambiguities in the scaling analysis of the spin dynamics data .",
    "note that these corrections are generated by the spin dynamics method .",
    "the equations of motion given by eq.([xyeqmot ] ) are integrated numerically for each initial spin configuration by a recently developed decomposition method @xcite .",
    "this method guarantees exact energy conservation and conservation of spin length @xmath57 and conserves @xmath54 within its numerical truncation errors . for the present study a second order integrator is used with the time step @xmath58 .",
    "this time step guarantees sufficient accuracy with respect to the conservation of @xmath54 and is much faster than well - known predictor corrector methods @xcite . for some accuracy and stability",
    "tests the time step has been increased to @xmath59 which still yields sufficient accuracy for the dynamic structure factor .",
    "fourth order integrators are much more accurate as far as @xmath54 conservation is concerned , but their internal complexity makes them much slower than a second order method for the same time step @xcite . moreover ,",
    "statistical errors are not decrased significantly by fourth order methods and we therefore only report results obtained by the second order method .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated to a final time of @xmath60 and thermal averages are taken over 1000 initial configurations .",
    "all error bars of dynamic quantities correspond to one standard deviation .",
    "the simulations have been performed on various dec alpha axp , ibm rs6000 , and hp risc8000 workstations both at the rwth aachen and the bugh wuppertal .",
    "the basic ingredient for the spin dynamics simulation is provided by the sequence of initial spin configurations , which has to be generated according to the canonical ensemble in order to provide well defined thermal averages .",
    "therefore , the static behavior of the xy model and especially the location of @xmath20 have to be determined first . for this purpose",
    "we employ the hybrid monte - carlo scheme described above for lattice sizes @xmath30 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for each system size and temperature",
    "we perform 10 blocks of @xmath63 hybrid steps for equilibration followed by @xmath64 hybrid steps for measurements .",
    "each measurement block yields an estimate for all static quantities of interest and from these we obtain our final estimates and estimates of their statistical error following standard procedures .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time of our hybrid algorithm is determined by the autocorrelation function of the energy or , equivalently , the _ modulus _ @xmath65 of the order parameter , which yield the slowest modes for the wolff algorithm .",
    "the autocorrelation times are generally rather short , at @xmath20 ( see below ) they range from about 5 hybrid mcs for @xmath61 to about 10 hybrid mcs for @xmath62 . for comparison ,",
    "the autocorrelation function for the order parameter itself yields an autocorrelation time of less than one hybrid mcs .",
    "the values for the equilibration and measurement periods given above thus translate to roughly 100 and 1000 autocorrelation times , respectively , which is sufficient for all practical purposes . in order to obtain the best statistics for magnetic quantities",
    "a measurement is made after every hybrid mcs .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath20 is determined by monitoring the temperature and size dependence of the binder cumulant ratio .",
    "specifically , we measure the cumulants @xmath66 it turns out that @xmath67 is more sensitive to changes in temperature and system size so that we only use @xmath67 for the final fine - tuning of the temperature @xmath68 . for convenience",
    "the temperature is expressed as the dimensionless reduced coupling @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the critical point . from standard procedures @xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath71 .",
    "for comparison we mention that @xmath72 for the standard plane rotator xy model on a simple cubic lattice in @xmath10 @xcite . by ignoring corrections to scaling and averaging over the measurements for @xmath73 and @xmath74 we find the estimates @xmath75 for the values @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the cumulants defined by eq.([u1u2 ] ) at the critical point .",
    "note that for @xmath78 the value of @xmath67 remains within two standard deviations of @xmath76 for all @xmath30 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath77 is within two standard deviations of the corresponding estimate @xmath79 found in ref.@xcite which already gives some evidence that the planar heisenberg variant of the xy model studied here is indeed a member of the static xy universality class .",
    "the critical exponents are estimated from the critical finite - size scaling behavior of the average modulus @xmath80 of the order parameter , the average square @xmath81 of the order parameter , and the temperature derivative of the latter . at @xmath82 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath83 one finds the leading scaling behavior @xmath84 with the system size @xmath30 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the critical exponents of the order parameter , the susceptibility , and the correlation length , respectively . during the data analysis it turns out that corrections to scaling can be ignored within the statistical error of the quantities in eq.([fss ] ) . from our estimate @xmath88 and @xmath89 20 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 40 , 50 , 60 , and 80 we find the following values for the critical exponents : @xmath90 these values satisfy the scaling relation @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we directly obtain from eq.([expon ] ) @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 in very good agreement with previous monte - carlo estimates @xcite and renormalization group theory for the @xmath96 ginzburg - landau model @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath97 of the specific heat can be obtained from , e.g. the hyperscaling relation , but the statistical error of @xmath87 is too large to exclude logarithmic behavior @xmath98 . apart from this deficiency our simulations confirm xy - like critical behavior for our version of the xy model ( see eq.([hxy ] ) ) quite accurately . in the following @xmath99",
    "is measured in units of @xmath100 chosen such that @xmath101 .",
    "we continue this section with a short discussion of the static spin - spin correlation function ( structure factor ) @xmath102 at the critical temperature .",
    "the static structure factor is the spatial fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath103 where @xmath104 refer to spin the components , @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote lattice vectors , and the thermal average is indicated by @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath108 due to translational invariance and reflection symmetry of the system .",
    "the spatial fourier transform is therefore given by a cosine transform which we use in the form @xmath109 with respect to the spontaneous magnetization of the xy model @xmath110 has a transverse component @xmath111 and a longitudinal component @xmath112 . in our monte - carlo simulation",
    "we measure @xmath113 and @xmath114 by _ rotating _ the coordinate system of the spins around the @xmath7-axis such that the random but finite magnetization vector @xmath53 is aligned with the @xmath38-direction .",
    "the @xmath37- and @xmath38-components of the spins in the rotated frame then correspond to the transverse and the longitudinal spin components , respectively , and their correlation functions yield @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the out - of - plane component @xmath117 of the static structure factor is independent of @xmath118 and does not show any critical behavior . according to eq.([gq ] )",
    "the normalization of @xmath110 is such that @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the static susceptibility .",
    "note that @xmath121 by definition and that @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the magnetic susceptibility with respect to the _ modulus _ of the magnetization .",
    "we furthermore limit the discussion to the @xmath124 direction , because other lattice directions do not provide new information on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the components of @xmath118 are always measured in units of the inverse lattice contant .    at @xmath20",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath112 of the static structure factor can be described by the model function @xmath125 where @xmath126 is taken from eq.([expon ] ) , @xmath127 ^ 2 $ ] captures lattice effects @xcite , and the finite - size scaling function @xmath128 is chosen as a simple generalization of a lorentzian : @xmath129^{-(2-\\eta)/2 } .\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 are determined from a fit to the data , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are independent of @xmath30 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath132 and @xmath133 as obtained from a fit to the data for @xmath134 . for @xmath135 and @xmath62 @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "are found within less than 1% of these values , for @xmath61 they are about 3% smaller . despite its simplicity the model function given by eq.([glq ] ) captures the shape of the monte - carlo estimate for the longitudinal component of the structure factor remarkably well .",
    "the finite - size scaling analysis of our data for @xmath112 for small @xmath136 , is shown in fig.[glscal ] .",
    "deviations from finite - size scaling set in at @xmath137 for @xmath61 , the data for @xmath135 , 60 , and 80 collapse within the error bars up to @xmath138 . within the symbol sizes data collapse is obtained up to @xmath139 , where lattice effects set in . for comparison the model scaling function @xmath140 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 , see eq.([glx ] ) ) is shown by the dashed line in fig.[glscal ] .",
    "the true scaling form of @xmath112 for small @xmath136 is captured rather well by @xmath128 .",
    "however , the choice of the model function is , of course , not unique .",
    "the dynamic structure factor @xmath0 is the space - time fourier transform of the position and time displaced spin - spin correlation function @xmath141 which we define by ( see eq.([gij ] ) ) @xmath142 the indices @xmath143 refer to spin components , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are lattice vectors , and @xmath144 and @xmath145 are moments in time to which the initial spin configuration has evolved according to the equations of motion ( see eq.([xyeqmot ] ) ) .",
    "the average @xmath146 is taken over the set of initial configurations as described in sec.ii .",
    "note that @xmath147 is also symmetric with respect to @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see eq.([gij ] ) ) . as the second argument only the time displacement enters , because the equations of motion are invariant under the transformation @xmath148 , @xmath149 ( see eqs.([hxy ] ) and ( [ xyeqmot ] ) ) .",
    "the space - time fourier transform is therefore also given by the cosine transform ( see eq.([gq ] ) ) @xmath150 note that the normalization in eq.([sqw ] ) is such that @xmath151 , where @xmath110 is the static structure factor defined by eq.([gq ] ) .",
    "the out - of - plane component @xmath17 of the dynamic structure factor is associated with the conserved out - of - plane magnetization @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath152 ( see also eq.([sqw ] ) ) is a constant in time .",
    "the in - plane magnetization ( order parameter ) @xmath53 is not conserved under the spin dynamics .",
    "although the time scale set by the motion of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is considerably larger than typical time scales set by spin waves , all initial differences between longitudinal and transverse components of the spin correlations completely disappear during the integration of the equations of motion .",
    "we therefore only discuss the average of the @xmath153 and the @xmath154 component of @xmath0 and refer to it as the `` in - plane component '' @xmath16 .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of @xmath0 above , below , and at the critical point .",
    "the correlation functions are measured up to a time displacement of @xmath155 away from criticality , where only smaller systems are considered . at the critical temperature",
    "we measure correlations up to @xmath156 for systems with up to @xmath134 lattice sites in each direction .      in order to avoid effects of criticality we choose the temperature @xmath157 in the following . due to the absence of critical finite - size scaling at this temperature we limit the spin dynamics simulations to smaller systems with @xmath61 , 24 , and 30 . for better momentum resolution",
    "we only present results obtained for @xmath158 , smaller @xmath30 yield identical results with a lower resolution in @xmath118 .",
    "we also limit the presentation to @xmath0 in the @xmath124 direction , other lattice directions provide essentially the same information . in fig.[sxzfit ]",
    "we show @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 as functions of the dimensionless frequency @xmath162 .",
    "both components apparently display a central peak without any additional features .",
    "for the values of @xmath68 and @xmath136 used in fig.[sxzfit ] one expects a central peak of lorentzian shape @xcite .",
    "as displayed by the solid line in fig.[sxzfit ] a simple lorentzian of the form @xmath163 ^ 2}\\ ] ] characterized by an amplitude @xmath164 and a width @xmath165 captures the shape of @xmath166 very well up to @xmath167 , where the intensity has already dropped by an order of magnitude . for",

    "the dashed line in fig.[sxzfit ] displays the lorentzian fit for @xmath169 according to eq.([lzz ] ) , where @xmath172 is indeed finite within its statistical error of roughly @xmath173 .",
    "however , eq.([lzz ] ) only captures the shape of @xmath169 up to @xmath174 .",

    "we expect the scaling behavior @xmath242 of the median frequency at the critical point .",
    "due to the presence of a strong central peak in @xmath226 the median frequency @xmath243 for @xmath134 turns out to be of the same size as the frequency resolution of our data .",

    "the spread in the values for the dynamic exponents obtained from the dispersion relations for small @xmath136 and the median frequencies is considerable . in order to reconcile all estimates with eq.([zm ] ) almost the full width of the error interval ( one standard deviation ) is needed .",

    "the above scaling analysis provides quite strong evidence for a violation of dynamic scaling in the sense that two different dynamic exponents are required in order to obtain scaling in the dispersion relations , the median frequencies , and the two components of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "however , we can not prove from our data whether the estimate @xmath257 , which indicates the violation of dynamic scaling , corresponds to the transient exponent @xmath258 @xcite or if the measured difference consitutes an _ effective _ exponent for system sizes which are too small to ignore additional corrections .",
    "as pointed out in sec.i the presence of energy conservation in our spin dynamics simulation gives rise to such corrections governed by the exponent @xmath259 @xcite . on the basis of our data",
    "we can not exclude the possibility , that these corrections yield the dominant contribution to the measured effective exponent @xmath258 . for a clarification of this point",
    "more information is needed from analytical theories of dynamic finite - size scaling @xcite and from simulations @xcite .",

    "<S> we present extensive monte - carlo spin dynamics simulations of the classical xy model in three dimensions on a simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a recently developed efficient integration algorithm for the equations of motion is used , which allows a substantial improvement of statistics and large integration times . </S>",
    "<S> we find spin wave peaks in a wide range around the critical point and spin diffusion for all temperatures . at the critical point </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a violation of dynamic scaling in the sense that independent components of the dynamic structure factor @xmath0 require different dynamic exponents in order to obtain scaling . below the critical point </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dispersion relation of the spin waves and the linewidths of @xmath0 and find agreement with mode coupling theory . apart from strong spin wave peaks we observe additional peaks in @xmath0 which can be attributed to two - spin wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the overall lineshapes are also discussed and compared to mode coupling predictions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present first results for the transport coefficient @xmath1 of the out - of - plane magnetization component at the critical point , which is related to the thermal conductivity of @xmath2he near the superfluid - normal transition . </S>"
