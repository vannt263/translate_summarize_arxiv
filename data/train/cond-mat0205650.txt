    "there is a growing interest in randomly evolving graphs since a large number of practically important problems can be analyzed in this way . in the last few years",
    "so many papers have been published in this field that any list of references would be far from complete by any standards .",
    "it is very fortunate that recently two outstanding review papers @xcite , @xcite have been published and thus the author of the present paper does not feel obliged to cite the large amount of important references .",
    "there are many different models for the random graphs and it would be difficult to give a precise classification of them . probably the oldest model has been proposed by erds and rnyi @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this model the initial state of the graph",
    "consists of fixed number @xmath18 of nodes that will be randomly connected during the evolution .",
    "the time is discrete and counted by the number of successively appearing lines . at time @xmath19 one of the @xmath20 possible lines defined by the nodes is chosen out assuming that each of these lines has the same probability to be chosen . at time @xmath21 the second line is chosen out from the @xmath22 possible lines all these being equiprobable . continuing this process at time @xmath23",
    "a random graph is formed which is consisting of @xmath18 fixed nodes and @xmath24 lines selected randomly .",
    "if @xmath18 is a large positive integer converging to infinity and @xmath24 is increasing from @xmath25 to @xmath20 then the evolution of the graph passes through several ( say five ) clearly distinguishable phases .",
    "one has to mention that random networks with fixed number of nodes usually show the so - called small - world effect , i.e. the average shortest path is small .",
    "this type of graphs can be created by randomly rewriting some of the lines of a regular ring graph .",
    "watts and strogatz @xcite noticed many interesting properties of these graphs called small - world networks and a large number of papers @xcite , @xcite was published recently on this subject .",
    "there is another - more realistic - model @xcite for the random evolution of graphs . in this model",
    "the number of nodes is not fixed , but to the contrary of the erds and rnyi model it is increasing in each discrete , equidistant time moment by addition of a new node connected randomly to one or several of the nodes already existing in the graph . the probability of a given connection between the new and one of the old nodes may depend on the number of links due to the node existing already .",
    "many variants @xcite , @xcite of this scale - free model have been recently investigated by using different inventive approximations .",
    "the one of the most intensively studied problem is the chracter of the degree distribution of nodes in graphs evolving randomly with various preferential linking .",
    "the number of exactly solvable ( or solved ) problems , however , is not very much , therefore , it seems to be worthwhile to study models which can be treated exactly .",
    "it is known for long time that the random evolution of a tree   corresponds to a galton - watson process @xcite which describes the formation of a population which starts at @xmath0 with one individual and in which at discrete time moments @xmath26 each individual independently of the others produces a random number of offspring with the same distribution .",
    "there are many interesting papers @xcite on this subject but it is hardly to find articles about the random processes of tree evolution with continuous time parameter .",
    "the purpose of is this paper is the study of these special random trees with the hope that it brings about new insight into the nature of branching processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the exact description of the random process",
    "is given , while in section 3 the derivations of the basic equations for the generating functions can be found .",
    "the properties of average characteristics ( expectation values , variances and correlation functions ) are discussed in section 4 , and , finally , the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we will study the random evolution of such trees which are consisting of living and dead nodes as well as lines connecting the nodes .",
    "the _ living node _ is unstable , and after a certain time @xmath4 may become dead .",
    "the lifetime @xmath4 is random variable , and denote by @xmath27 the probability of finding @xmath4 in the time interval @xmath28 .",
    "dead node _ is inactive , can not change its state , and is unable to interact with the other nodes .    the evolution process can be described as follows .",
    "let us suppose that at time instance @xmath0 the tree consists of a single living node called _ root _ and denote by @xmath1 this state of the tree .",
    "at the end of its life the root creates @xmath29 new living nodes and after that it becomes immediately dead .",
    "the number of the offspring @xmath5 is random variable , and the probabilities @xmath30 are supposed to be known .",
    "the new living nodes are promptly connected to the dead one and independently of the others each of them can evolve further like a root .",
    "it means that the tree from its _ initial state _ @xmath1 may evolve further by two mutually exclusive ways :    * the root does not die , and thus the tree remains in its initial state during the whole time interval @xmath31 , or * the root does die in an infinitesimally small subinterval @xmath32 and produces @xmath33 new living nodes .",
    "each of these nodes will evolve further in the remained time interval @xmath34 independently of the others like the root .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the initial state of a tree consisting of a single root and illustrates four of the possible states which may be produced by the dying root .",
    "the probabilities of producing @xmath35 living nodes are denoted by @xmath36 .",

    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] three white circles denoting the living nodes which are capable for the further evolution and a large number of the black circles denoting the dead nodes which are unable to produce new living nodes .",
    "it is to mention that each of the offspring is connected by a line to the dead precursor .",
    "if a dead node has @xmath38 outgoing lines then it will be called _ node of @xmath38th out - degree_. it is obvious that a _ living tree _ must have living nodes , while a _ dead tree _ consists of dead nodes only .    in order to simplify our consideration we will assume that the distribution function of the lifetime @xmath4 of living nodes is exponential , i.e. @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the expectation value of the lifetime .",
    "in this case the evolution becomes a markov process .",

    "i.e. , when @xmath184 , the correlation function passing its maximum converges to the limit value @xmath15 as seen on the curve * b*. finally , one can see that the curve * c * due to the value @xmath263 is reaching the level @xmath25 not monotonously but through a slight maximum .",
