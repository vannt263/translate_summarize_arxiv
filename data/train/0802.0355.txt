    "this gives a negative value of running of spectral index which is consistent with the observational data .",
    "another important observational signature is a non - gaussianity of cosmological perturbations@xcite .",
    "recent study@xcite shows that non - gaussianity at @xmath92 confidence level is in the region @xmath93 where non - gaussianity parameter @xmath94 is defined as @xmath95 here , subscript @xmath96 denotes the gaussian part of @xmath32 .",
    "detection of non - gaussianity from the future satellite experiment can discriminate between different inflation models .",
    "interestingly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that thermal fluctuations may lead to a large non - gaussianity .",
    "the non - gaussianity parameter takes the form in the thermal fluctuation model @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a thermal length scale .",

    "the non - gaussianity in thermal non - commutative inflation model is under considerations.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have considered the inflation model which arises due to the non - commutativity of spacetime in the early universe and calculated the spectral index and the running of spectral index in this model .",
    "non - commutativity of spacetime at the planck scale may deform usual dispersion relations .",
    "further , these modified dispersion relations make it possible to obtain a period of inflation driven by non - commutative radiation . while the seeds for large scale structure in the usual scalar field driven inflation model are quantum fluctuations , those are thermal fluctuations in non - commutative inflation . keeping these in mind , it seems natural to impose the initial conditions at thermal correlation length to maintain thermal equilibrium . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that this inflation model can give a scale invariant spectrum in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "one of the important features of this model is the existence of two branches . in the high energy limit ,",
    "energy decreases as momentum increases .",
    "this property is crucial in realizing accelerated expansion phase in modified dispersion relations . on the contrary , as momentum decreases , energy decreases in the low energy limit as in usual dispersion relations .",
    "thus , as temperature drops , the accelerated expansion phase change into the usual radiation dominated phase ( @xmath100 ) smoothly without need of reheating .    it might be worth to find the observational signal of these distinct features of non - commutative inflation model to discriminate from the usual scalar field driven inflation model .",
    "we thus have calculated the spectral index and the running of spectral index . with the slow - roll approximation , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these show that power spectrum is scale invariant as long as @xmath103(or @xmath1 ) , which is a necessary condition for occurring enough inflation , and has negative running of spectral index . while the running of spectral index is consistent with data , the spectral index seems to be inconsistent since wmap three - year data favor @xmath80 .",
    "another important observational signal is a non - gaussianity of cosmological perturbations whose detection will be an important mission in the future satellite experiment .",
    "thermal fluctuations can lead to a large non - gaussianity@xcite @xcite if thermal length scale is smaller than horizon scale at the horizon crossing .",
    "the non - gaussianity in this non - commutative inflation model is under considerations@xcite .",
    "these observational signals can provide the possibility to probe planck scale physics in the current observations by the induced signals in the spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
