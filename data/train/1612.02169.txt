    "single crystals of yb(rh@xmath11co@xmath12)@xmath13si@xmath13 ( @xmath50 , 0.07 , 0.12 , 0.38 , 0.68 , 1.00 ) , ybir@xmath13si@xmath13 , and ybni@xmath14p@xmath13 have been grown and characterized as described previously @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of the laue diffraction pattern taken from the samples suggests high crystalline quality which for ybrh@xmath13si@xmath13 and ybco@xmath13si@xmath13 is also confirmed by excellent arpes and stm data @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the samples have been extensively studied with e.g. specific heat , resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements . from these data",
    "a consistent picture of the kondo scale in the yb(rh@xmath11co@xmath12)@xmath13si@xmath13 has emerged showing a gradual decrease of the single ion kondo temperature @xmath0 from about 25k for @xmath51 to well below 1k for @xmath52 @xcite . the onset of coherence effects in the resistivity which is typical for kondo lattices scales similarly from about 120k for @xmath51 to @xmath531.5k for @xmath52 .",
    "the rxes data have been taken with the x - ray emission spectrometer of the former esrf beamline id16 , now upgraded and reopened as id20 , looking at the yb @xmath16-@xmath15 emission line .",
    "measuring with energy resolution in the scattered beam significantly reduces the life - time broadening of the spectra and furthermore can be used to enhance the weak yb@xmath10 contributions in the kondo lattices @xcite . for each sample",
    "we have taken the yb @xmath16 xas spectrum , then fixed the incident photon energy to the maximum of the yb@xmath10 resonance and measured the yb @xmath15 rxes spectrum . the experimental procedure and the data analysis",
    "are described in details in @xcite .",
    "the data has been taken twice for each sample during two different experiments and using two different sample growth batches .",
    "the results of the first and the second run of experiments are exactly the same showing perfect reproducibility of our experimental findings . as a hard x - ray photon - in photon - out technique yb",
    "@xmath16 edge rxes is a bulk sensitive technique free of surface effects .",
    "the available temperature range was 3k to 300k and the data was taken starting from low temperature .",
    "properties of ce systems at higher temperatures including the effect of cef have been theoretically studied using a scaling approach @xcite .",
    "the result is that at higher temperatures , when the first excited and the second excited cef doublets get thermally populated , the low temperature kondo scale @xmath54 , where only the ground state doublet is taken into account , is replaced by an effective high temperature kondo scale @xmath55 and @xmath56{t_{k,0}\\,\\delta_1\\,\\delta_2}$ ] , respectively , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the energies of the first and the second excited cef doublets , respectively .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath59 , the effective kondo scale at high @xmath2 is mostly determined by the cef splitting , and of the size of the cef splitting . further on , the lower @xmath54 , the larger will be the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "for trivalent yb the effect is even stronger , because the ground state @xmath40 multiplet is @xmath34 instead of @xmath61 for ce .",
    "thus the cef leads to four doublets instead of three . accordingly",
    "the high temperature kondo scale will be @xmath62{t_{k,0}\\,\\delta_1\\,\\delta_2\\,\\delta_3}$ ] .",
    "usually the kondo effect is considered to become less and less effective upon increasing @xmath2 , but there are some properties for which a strengthening of the effect of the kondo interaction upon increasing @xmath2 due to the involvement of excited cef levels is well known and theoretically and experimentally well documented , e.g. the resistivity @xcite . for the simple , but theoretically more accessible single kondo ion model , the magnetic contribution to the resistivity @xmath63 first decreases logarithmically upon increasing @xmath2 , with parameters defined by @xmath54 .",
    "but when @xmath2 approaches @xmath57 and/or @xmath58 , @xmath64 increases markedly , passes through a maximum , and then decreases again logarithmically , but with a larger slope than at lower @xmath2 . the larger slope at high @xmath2 is directly connected to the higher effective degeneracy of the local moment at high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is also expected for the kondo lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high temperature kondo scale defined above , @xmath65 and @xmath60 , have been shown to be relevant for the description of the magnetic susceptibility at high @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "<S> * the kondo model predicts both the valence at low temperatures and its temperature dependence to scale with the characteristic energy @xmath0 of the kondo interaction . we have studied the evolution of the @xmath1 occupancy in a series of yb kondo lattices as a function of temperature using resonant x - ray emission spectroscopy . </S>",

    "<S> this observation is in remarkable contradiction to both the naive expectation and to precise theoretical predictions of the kondo model . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest excited crystal electric field levels and lattice vibrations to be possible origins of this unexpected result . *    </S>",
    "<S> while most of the rare earth ( re ) elements show a very stable trivalent state in solids , some of them , especially ce , yb and eu , may display different valence states depending on the chemical composition , the temperature , and the applied pressure or magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this valence instability , which is caused by the @xmath4 shell being almost empty ( ce ) , almost full ( yb ) or almost half - filled ( eu ) , is connected with a hybridization between localized @xmath1 and delocalized valence states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> weak hybridization results in a stable trivalent re state with large local magnetic moments which order at low @xmath2 due to rkky exchange . with increasing hybridization the local moment gets screened by the conduction electrons via kondo interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as a result magnetic order disappears leaving a paramagnetic ground state with strongly renormalized conduction electrons , referred to as kondo lattices and heavy fermion systems . in these systems </S>",
    "<S> the occupation of the @xmath4 shell , i.e. the number of @xmath1 electrons @xmath5 for ce or @xmath1 holes @xmath6 for yb , shows a weak decrease with increasing hybridization and the valence starts to deviate from the trivalent state @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> models based on the kondo interaction have proven to be very appropriate to describe this regime @xcite . in the limit of strong hybridization , </S>",

    "<S> have attracted a lot of attention @xcite . particularly fascinating are phase transitions at absolute zero temperature , called quantum phase transitions , which are often connected to unconventional superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the re valence and of the occupation of the @xmath4 level is crucial for an understanding of the exotic properties of such systems .    the simplicity of the x - ray absorption / emission measurements at the @xmath8 edges of rare earth elements and the large x - ray penetration depth providing bulk specific results made this technique a standard for the study of the valence in kondo lattice and intermediate valent systems as a function of composition and temperature . </S>",

    "<S> lattices the deviation from the trivalent state is small and typical changes in @xmath5 between 3k and 300k are only of the order of a few percent , these studies of the @xmath2 dependent changes concentrated on systems with a relatively high @xmath9k . however , the most interesting cases are those where the deviation from trivalent is small , since this is the regime where the transition from a magnetic ordered to a paramagnetic ground state occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strong development of resonant x - ray emission spectroscopy ( rxes ) has opened new possibilities for studying even minute valence changes in kondo lattices and to determine @xmath5 with very high accuracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the yb case is especially favorable for rxes because the weak signal of the `` minority '' yb@xmath10 state is on the low energy side of the absorption edge , i.e. in a region with very low background by other emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> rxes allows to selectively enhance this yb@xmath10 signal by at least one order of magnitude @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the dashed lines are guides to the eye . ]    within the usually used approximations the kondo model predicts that both the low temperature valence , @xmath25 , and the temperature scale , @xmath3 , on which the valence changes occur will increase with increasing kondo scale @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b clearly shows that there is indeed a very nice correlation between @xmath20 measured with rxes and the thermodynamically determined @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 suggests a power law dependence between both properties , i.e. @xmath28 . the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]b corresponds to @xmath29 and @xmath30 . within the kondo model both @xmath20 and @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> depend on several parameters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the exact relation between both properties is a complex and non - universal one . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a simple approximation , @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the hybridization width of the ground state doublet @xcite . @xmath0 itself depends exponentially on @xmath32 which results in a weak logarithmic dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath0 . in total that should lead to a sublinear dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , given the approximations made , the @xmath29 power law we observed is in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed perfect scaling between @xmath20 and @xmath0 is strongly indicating that the kondo effect is the dominant interaction responsible for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore a big surprise that the @xmath2 induced increase of the yb valence towards 3 + occurs on almost the same temperature scale @xmath3 for all compounds ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) , independently of @xmath20 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the kondo model has proven to be very successful in explaining even fine details of the properties of yb - kondo lattices @xcite , but it predicts the @xmath2 scale of the recovery of the 3 + state to be proportional to @xmath0 , an intuitively trivial relation . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore needs to look for possible mechanisms that could modify the @xmath2 dependence expected within the simple approximation usually used for kondo systems .    </S>",
    "<S> a first candidate is the crystal electric field ( cef ) , which is not taken into account in those simple approximations , but which is known to be important in rare earth compounds . </S>",
    "<S> cef leads to a splitting of the @xmath34 multiplet of yb@xmath17 into 4 doublets ( or one quartet and 2 doublets in case of a cubic local yb symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> usually for kondo physics only the lowest doublet is considered but at higher temperatures , when @xmath2 becomes comparable to the cef splitting , excited cef levels get thermally populated and become relevant . </S>",
    "<S> notably the overall cef splitting of yb compounds is typically of the order of 200k , the size of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for a single kondo ion , an exact calculation of @xmath6 including cef is extremely demanding , and therefore to the best of our knowledge has only been done for one very specific case @xcite . hence the effect of cef on the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath6 is not very clear at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> naively , because the kondo scale depends exponentially on the degeneracy @xmath35 of the effective local moment , involvement of excited cef states corresponds to an increase in the effective degeneracy which should result in an increase of the effective kondo scale with increasing @xmath2 . because of the exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath35 , this effect would become stronger upon decreasing @xmath0 of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus it would provide a way for making @xmath3 independent of the ground state @xmath0 ( for a more detailed argument , see appendix [ app : cef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect would also be expected if the hybridization of an excited cef level is stronger than the hybridization strength of the ground state doublet . </S>",
    "<S> different hybridization strength for different cef levels have rarely been considered so far . </S>",
    "<S> but recent theoretical and experimental results indicate that the hybridization depends on the symmetry of the cef level @xcite , and that this might result in unexpected phenomena @xcite . in ybrh@xmath13si@xmath13 , where the hybridization of the cef ground state seems to be relatively weak , such an effect might become important . </S>",
    "<S> an stm study of ybrh@xmath13si@xmath13 indeed provided evidence that in this compound the evolution of the kondo lattice at higher temperatures is strongly influenced by excited cef levels @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another factor which could be relevant for @xmath36 is the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that thermal expansion does not have a significant effect on @xmath36 . in yb kondo </S>",
    "<S> lattices increasing the volume results in a shift of the valence towards the 2 + state , because of its larger atomic volume @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the normal thermal expansion should lead to an increase of @xmath24 with increasing @xmath2 , opposite to the experimental observation . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is about 300k to 400k , which is similar to the debye temperatures @xmath37 of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 does not show large variations between the studied yb compounds , typically differing by not more than @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these differences would be even smaller if one would consider a @xmath37 only corresponding to the vibration of yb atoms . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is tempting to discuss the universal @xmath3 scale in terms of a phonon - induced mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of the quasiparticles at the fermi level @xmath39 due to electron - phonon coupling is indeed expected to vanish on the scale of @xmath37 which would lead to a decrease of the renormalized electronic density of states at @xmath39 on the same @xmath2 scale . as the kondo energy is proportional to the renormalized electronic density of states </S>",
    "<S> , one would therefore expect @xmath0 to decrease with increasing temperature on a @xmath2 scale related to the debye temperature . </S>",
    "<S> but at the same time , the exchange coupling itself should also be affected by thermally excited phonons and a preliminary analysis indicates that it might increase with increasing @xmath2 , thus compensating the effect of the change in renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the effect of enhanced thermal vibration is not yet clear and requires more theoretical and experimental studies . on a general level , in strongly correlated electron systems the effect of the lattice on the electronic properties </S>",
    "<S> is usually just ignored . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent studies indicate that taking the lattice into account might severely change the expected electronic properties @xcite . very recently </S>",
    "<S> , a study of the effect of zero point and thermal ionic motion on the superexchange @xmath40 in cuprates indicates a strong motional broadening of @xmath40 giving rise to substantial effects on some electronic and magnetic properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that a determination of the kondo scale based on the @xmath2 dependence of the valence determined with x - ray spectroscopy , as frequently done , is at least questionable . </S>",
    "<S> instead this @xmath2 dependence might not necessarily be related to the kondo scale . </S>",
    "<S> rxes is intimately related to standard @xmath8 edge xas and other x - ray and electron spectroscopic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies comparing the different techniques showed that hard and soft x - ray photoemission yield the same low @xmath2 valences and @xmath2 dependences as x - ray absorption / emission techniques for yb compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> part of the previously reported results on other yb compounds which we included in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 and 4 have been obtained with x - ray spectroscopies other than rxes and show the same @xmath2 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> thus the surprising @xmath2 dependent behavior reported here is seen independent of the employed spectroscopic technique and seems to be universal for yb kondo lattice systems . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see whether the valence changes in ce kondo lattices with temperature follow a similar universal temperature curve independent of the kondo scale @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a result might provide some further insight into the origin of the unexpected temperature dependence of @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the high sensitivity and accuracy in determining @xmath33 with rxes and the nice relation observed between @xmath0 and @xmath20 suggest some immediate application in the field of kondo lattices . in kondo lattices where @xmath0 is of the order of or smaller than the magnetic ordering temperature , thermodynamic , transport and magnetic data can not reliably determine @xmath0 since all these properties are then controlled by the rkky energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> in such systems , a rxes measurement of @xmath20 can provide a much more reliable estimation of @xmath0 using the power law scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood since @xmath20 , in contrast to many other properties , is not affected by the rkky exchange .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we used resonant x - ray emission spectroscopy ( rxes ) to study the evolution of the valence in the kondo alloy yb(rh@xmath11co@xmath12)@xmath13si@xmath13 and a few further yb based kondo lattices as a function of composition and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the kondo temperature @xmath0 in the studied compounds cover the range from very small values @xmath41k up to quite large values @xmath42k . with present rxes techniques </S>",
    "<S> the yb valence @xmath43 in such systems can be determined with very high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to study the deviation from a strict trivalent state , i.e. the deviation in the number of holes @xmath6 in the 4f shell from unity , @xmath44 , as function of composition and temperature with a precision of the order of 0.1% . combining the present results and literature data , we reveal an almost perfect linear correlation between @xmath45 determined from rxes at @xmath46k and @xmath27 determined from thermodynamic properties . </S>",
    "<S> this linear correlations extends over 3 orders of magnitude , from @xmath41k and @xmath47 up to @xmath48k and @xmath49 . upon increasing @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , all systems evolve towards a pure trivalent state , but surprisingly the @xmath2 scale on which @xmath33 decreases with increasing @xmath2 is almost the same for all compounds , an thus does not scale at all with @xmath0 . looking for the origin of this unexpected universal @xmath2 scale we identify two possible candidates , excited cef levels and lattice vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> however the effect of both properties on @xmath36 has not been studied yet and is thus presently not clear . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our results urge for more experimental and theoretical studies on how excited cef levels and lattice vibrations affect the @xmath2 dependence of the valence .    </S>",
