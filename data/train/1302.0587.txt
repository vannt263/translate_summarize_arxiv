    "since the inception of gauge theory , in particular seiberg - witten theory , one of the fundamental problems is to find a pair of nondiffeomorphic @xmath0-manifolds which have the same seiberg - witten invariants . despite of the fact that seiberg - witten theory has been very successful in the study of smooth @xmath0-manifolds , it is still mysterious to find a pair of simply connected nondiffeomorphic @xmath0-manifolds with the same seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "one of the main reasons is that we do not have enough techniques to distinguish smooth @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "but the situation is a little bit different in non - simply connected case .",
    "for example , fintushel and stern constructed a single pair of ( non - simply connected ) nondiffeomorphic symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with the same seiberg - witten invariants using knot surgery and a covering method  @xcite .",
    "knot surgery , introduced by fintushel and stern  @xcite , is a very effective method to construct exotic @xmath0-manifolds because one can modify the seiberg - witten invariants without changing the topological type of a given @xmath0-manifold .",
    "numerous new exotic smooth @xmath0-manifolds were constructed by using a knot surgery technique .",
    "note that the seiberg - witten invariant of a knot surgery @xmath0-manifold is closely related to the alexander polynomial of the corresponding knot  @xcite and there are infinitely many inequivalent knots with the same alexander polynomial  @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to expect that the seiberg - witten invariant alone is not sufficient to distinguish all smooth @xmath0-manifolds .    in this article",
    "we extend fintushel and stern s result  @xcite using the same technique .",
    "that is , we show that there are infinitely many pairs of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which share the same seiberg - witten invariants but they are not diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "moreover , we get the following theorem :    [ main theorem ] for each integer @xmath1 , there exist @xmath2 distinct ( non - simply connected ) symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with the same seiberg - witten invariants which are mutually nondiffeomorphic , but homeomorphic .    in order to construct such families ,",
    "we first investigate a family of @xmath3-bridge knots with the same alexander polynomial which kanenobu studied  @xcite .",
    "note that each @xmath3-bridge knot has a dihedral covering link and its covering linkage invariants are well known  @xcite@xcite .",
    "so we can apply fintushel and stern s covering method to this family of knots .",
    "the hard part is to prove that the seiberg - witten invariants of the covering link surgery @xmath0-manifolds are different .",
    "the problem is related to distinguish the multivariable alexander polynomials of the corresponding dihedral covering links . to do this , we compute the covering linkage invariants and we notice that the change of diagonal elements of the linking matrix has some pattern .",
    "and then we show that the corresponding multivariable alexander polynomials of the dihedral covering links are mutually distinct by using this pattern of the change of diagonal element and the torres condition of a multivariable alexander polynomial .",
    "so we conclude that the corresponding seiberg - witten invariants of the covering link surgery @xmath0-manifolds are mutually different .",
