    "in this supplementary material , we briefly summarize some basic results from ref .   about evaluating the @xmath0 invariant in inversion symmetric systems . we repeat them here to help integrate the key formula , eq .",

    "a more elaborate discussion , including detailed derivations can be found in refs .  .",
    "a time - reversal invariant band - insulator is characterized by a @xmath0 invariant @xmath152 , with @xmath153 and @xmath154 denoting trivial and non - trivial insulator respectively .",
    "the value of this invariant follows from the properties of the bloch wavefunctions of the occupied bands . for the generic case ( with no symmetries other than time - reversal ) , there are several equivalent ways for its evaluation .",
    "however , all methods require a careful gauge choice for the wavefunctions across the brillouin zone .",
    "finding such a gauge is often difficult .",
    "shortcuts are possible in the presence of additional symmetries . for example , for 2d systems where the @xmath36-component of the spin is conserved , evaluating @xmath152 reduces to the calculation of the chern number @xmath155 from the wavefunctions of one of the spin components .",
    "the result is simply @xmath156 this result is used to establish the quantum spin hall phase of eq .   of the main text for @xmath72 .",
    "in the main text , we extensively use another shortcut , which is available if the system has inversion symmetry .",
    "this leads to a radical simplification in both 2d and 3d . before citing the result of ref .",
    ", we briefly summarize some basic facts about the eigenstates of inversion symmetric , time - reversal invariant , lattice periodic hamiltonians .",
    "inversion symmetry means that the hamiltonian @xmath157 is invariant under @xmath89 .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is @xmath158 and it acts on lattice periodic functions ( bloch functions ) . we denote the reciprocal lattice vectors by @xmath159 . at a generic @xmath113 , unlike @xmath157 ,",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is not invariant under @xmath160 nor under time - reversal @xmath147 , since both map @xmath161 .",
    "the momenta @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) , however , are special because @xmath164 and @xmath165 are equivalent wavevectors .",
    "this means that @xmath166 is invariant under both generalized time - reversal and inversion operators : , and @xmath167 , where the exponentials take @xmath168 back to @xmath169 [ cf .",
    "note that the operators @xmath170 and @xmath171 map lattice periodic functions to lattice periodic functions .",
    "because of the generalized inversion symmetry , the eigenstates @xmath172 of @xmath169 can be labeled by inversion eigenvalues @xmath173 , @xmath174 it is straightforward to show that the corresponding eigenstates @xmath175 of the hamiltonian @xmath157 are eigenstates of @xmath176 ( and not @xmath171 ) with the same eigenvalue @xmath177 .",
    "the symmetry under @xmath170 means that the energies at @xmath164 ( i.e. , the eigenvalues of @xmath178 ) come in kramers degenerate pairs .",
    "the kramers pair of a bloch eigenstate @xmath172 is @xmath179 . because the symmetries @xmath170 and @xmath171 commute , @xmath172 and @xmath179 share the same inversion eigenvalue .",
    "the @xmath92-th kramers doublet at @xmath164 can thus be characterized by a single inversion eigenvalue @xmath180 .",
    "we are now ready to state the result of ref .  :",
    "fu and kane showed that the inversion eigenvalues corresponding to the filled bands straightforwardly determine whether an insulator is in a topological phase .",
    "the system is a topological insulator ( @xmath154 ) if @xmath181 where @xmath92 runs over the kramers doublets of the filled bands .",
    "note that the invariant is even simpler than the chern number , since it does not require the integration of a ( possibly complicated ) function over the brillouin zone ; its sole inputs are the parity eigenvalues at a few discrete points in momentum space ."

    "<S> it is however very different to existing proposed cold - atom implementations of @xmath0 topological insulators@xcite , which imprint non - abelian gauge potentials on atoms in a deep optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our key innovation is to approach the problem from the opposite , nearly free electron limit . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath6 is the identity , while @xmath7 is a position - dependent @xmath8 matrix acting on the internal states of the atom . to realize a @xmath0 topological insulator requires @xmath3 to be even , owing to a `` spin '' structure , and the hamiltonian has to be invariant under time reversal , @xmath9@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> many implementations are possible . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the various transitions between the internal states could be spectrally resolved , allowing the freedom separately to introduce coupling lasers for all transitions ( or pairs of lasers for raman coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are very general , and could be applied to any such implementation . however , to make the discussion concrete </S>",

    "<S> the implementation we consider makes use of the properties of the groundstate ( @xmath20 ) and long - lived excited state ( @xmath21 ) of ytterbium ( yb ) or an alkaline earth atom . the usefulness of these two levels for optically induced gauge fields was pointed out by gerbier and dalibard@xcite : the long lifetime of the excited state reduces spontaneous emission ; furthermore , there is a convenient `` anti - magic '' wavelength @xmath22 at which the two states experience scalar optical potentials of opposite signs , allowing state - dependent potentials , @xmath23 , to be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on @xmath24yb@xcite which has nuclear spin @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> then both @xmath26 and @xmath27 have two internal states , and there are four states in total ; these will correspond to the @xmath28 structure in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the magnetic field to be sufficiently small that the zeeman splitting is negligible , and all four @xmath27-@xmath26 transitions involve the same frequency @xmath29 . combining the single - photon coupling , with electric field @xmath30 , with the state dependent potential @xmath31 , leads to the optical potential which in the rotating wave approxmation@xcite is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the detuning . </S>",

    "<S> this energy scale should be compared to the characteristic kinetic energy scale , the recoil energy @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the interspecies coupling ( [ eq : efield ] ) is formed from three ( standing ) waves of linearly polarised light at the coupling frequency @xmath42 : two of equal amplitude with wavevectors in the 2d plane ( @xmath43 for @xmath44-polarization and @xmath45 for @xmath36-polarization ) and one with wavevector normal to the 2d plane for @xmath46-polarization with an amplitude smaller by a factor @xmath47 . since @xmath48 the magnitude of the in - plane wavevectors is @xmath49 with the wavelength of the @xmath27-@xmath26 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of @xmath31 is set by a standing wave at the anti - magic wavelength @xmath22@xcite , which creates a state - dependent potential with @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> for yb , @xmath52 ( to an accuracy of about 3@xmath53 ) , so @xmath54 . for simplicity , in all following discussions we fix @xmath55 and define @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical coupling @xmath17 then has the symmetry of a triangular lattice with lattice vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics arising from this form of optical coupling is most clearly exposed by applying a unitary transformation @xmath59@xcite to the dimensionless coupling @xmath17 @xmath60 we have used the shorthand @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] . for @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> this matrix decouples into two @xmath64 blocks , one for each eigenvalue of @xmath65 , as does the hamiltonian since the kinetic energy ( [ eq : ham ] ) is diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the four - level system decouples into two two - level subsystems , each experiencing its own form of optical dressing , @xmath66 , differing only in the sign of the @xmath67 term . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the optical dressing required to realize the `` triangular '' optical flux lattice described in ref.@xcite ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this optical flux lattice causes the atoms to experience a ( periodic ) effective magnetic field with @xmath68 flux quanta in the unit cell . for @xmath69 the lowest energy band ( which is twofold degenerate@xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> is separated in energy from higher bands . </S>",
    "<S> this band is topologically non - trivial , having a chern number of @xmath70 , with sign set by the net sign of the coefficients @xmath71 . since this sign differs for the two subsystems , their lowest bands have equal and opposite chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is required by the fact that these subsystems are related by time - reversal . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath72 the optical dressing realizes the bandstructure required to generate the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect : there are two decoupled subsystems , the lowest energy bands of which have chern numbers @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> each of these bands is filled when the 2d density of fermions ( in that component ) is equal to the magnetic flux density , @xmath73 . when both bands are filled , at a total fermion density of @xmath74 , the bulk of the system is gapped . </S>",
    "<S> however , there will be a metallic surface state involving counterpropagating edge modes of opposite spin . </S>",
    "<S> this metallic surface state is the hallmark of the topological order that characterizes the qsh effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the qsh effect is a special case of the @xmath0 topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 topological insulator , in general , does not allow separation into two decoupled systems , but retains counterpropagating edge states that are protected only by trs . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero value of @xmath47 introduces a coupling between the two spin - states in a manner that preserves trs , in direct analogy to the effects of spin - orbit coupling on the electronic structure of solids . in fig.[fig : split ] we show the few lowest energy bands for a small nonzero value of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the bands were calculated by numerical diagonalization in the plane wave basis . )     </S>",
    "<S> lowest energy bands for the 2d topological insulator with @xmath75 and @xmath76 for wavevectors on the perimeter of the parallelogram ( shown in the inset ) with corners @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> each band is twofold degenerate , with fourfold degeneracies at @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the four bands with @xmath80 have non - trivial @xmath0 invariant , as follows from the eigenstate parities ( @xmath81 ) at @xmath82 . ]    for @xmath63 all bands are fourfold degenerate . for @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy splits into two doubly degenerate branches at most wavevectors . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fourfold degeneracy remains at three nonequivalent symmetry points in @xmath84-space : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the reciprocal lattice vectors are simply given by @xmath88 . )    due to the coupling between the two subsystems , the chern number of a subsystem is no longer well defined , but the bands still carry a topological character since the @xmath72 case is adiabatically connected to the qsh limit . to demonstrate this </S>",
    "<S> , one has to use a more general @xmath0 invariant@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this invariant takes a particularly simple form for our system owing to its symmetry under spatial inversion , @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> inversion symmetric insulators , as shown by fu and kane@xcite , are @xmath0 nontrivial if @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the inversion eigenvalues corresponding to the @xmath92-th kramers doublet of bands at the momenta @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) . </S>",
    "<S> evaluating eq .   for our system </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is indeed in a topological phase : the points with fourfold degeneracies contribute with @xmath95 while @xmath96 contributes with unity , as indicated in fig  [ fig : split ] . </S>",
    "<S> although we have shown bands for the special case of a triangular lattice , our approach is very general : starting from an optical flux lattice of any symmetry@xcite , our method will lead to a 2d @xmath0 topological insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> _ three dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> _ our approach has the remarkable feature that it generalizes naturally to 3d topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> one simply needs to substitute @xmath97 where our notation follows that of eq .  , and we use @xmath98 . that this system is a good candidate for a topological insulator </S>",
    "<S> can be checked using the parities as in eq .  , but the product is now over eight momenta @xmath99 ( @xmath100)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evaluating the product shows that the parities are those of a @xmath0 topological phase for a large range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this range includes systems which are insulators as well . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3dti ] , where we show the few lowest energy bands of the model for a point in the regime where the parity product is negative . a clear bandgap separates the lowest four bands from the higher bands , showing that the system is an insulator .     </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath101 and @xmath102 uniformly spaced across the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the four bands with @xmath106 have non - trivial @xmath0 invariant which , together with the clear band gap , demonstrate the topological insulator phase . </S>",
    "<S> the right hand panel shows the density of states . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this extension to 3d entails additional geometrical constraints on the wavevectors of the coupling and state - dependent lasers . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath107 the state - dependent potential @xmath108 has to have periodicity @xmath109 . for yb , </S>",
    "<S> this differs from that achieved by the anti - magic wavelength @xmath110 , so in this case there will be an additional state independent potential@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that this does not affect the appearance of the @xmath0 topological insulator phase for the lowest 4 bands .    </S>",
    "<S> while the robust and simple realization of a 3d topological insulator is a key result , the choice might seem fortuitous . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining part of the letter introduces a constructive approach for finding 3d systems with @xmath0 nontrivial parities . a hint for this is given by the 2d case , if one notes that the @xmath82 with negative parities are precisely the points in momentum space with fourfold degeneracies . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood using the following symmetry considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is invariant under translations by the lattice vectors @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated reciprocal lattice vectors are simply @xmath112 , and define the brillouin zone for the conserved momentum @xmath113 . using the bloch decomposition @xmath114 , the eigenvalue problem at each @xmath113 point follows from the hamiltonian @xmath115 acting on lattice periodic functions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath116 has half - translation symmetries @xmath117 and @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath119 is the operator of translation with the vector @xmath120 . ) at the special momenta @xmath82 , @xmath121 is invariant under both generalized time - reversal and inversion operators : @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the two symmetries commute , hence @xmath124 and its kramers partner @xmath125 share the same inversion eigenvalue @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> from the fact that @xmath127 on lattice periodic functions , it follows that . </S>",
    "<S> this means that at @xmath128 the application of @xmath129 , at @xmath130 of @xmath131 and at @xmath132 of either @xmath133 reverses the inversion eigenvalue : this requires , firstly , that the energies are fourfold degenerate , and , secondly , that for each energy the inversion eigenvalues come in opposite pairs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the degenerate points contributed with @xmath95 in eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> these considerations allow one to construct 3d configurations with @xmath0 nontrivial parities : consider a model which has a reflection symmetry @xmath134 and a half - translation symmetry by @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath136 is the third primitive lattice vector . ) </S>",
    "<S> the reflection symmetry results in @xmath137 , while the half translation symmetry means that at @xmath138 and @xmath139 the inversion eigenvalues come in opposite pairs for each energy , making the energies fourfold degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for any @xmath140 doublets we have @xmath141 , so the net parity is @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the model can be written as @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath144 realizes a two dimensional topological insulator with @xmath140 filled kramers pair of bands , then @xmath145 for a weak @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the net parity for the lowest @xmath140 kramers pairs must be negative : the model is _ guaranteed _ to have the parities of a 3d @xmath0 topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the choice eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is one of the simplest ones consistent with this strategy .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have described how simple forms of optical coupling can lead to low - energy bands that have non - trivial @xmath0 topological invariant , in both 2d and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> weakly interacting fermions filling these bands will form incompressible band insulators , and exhibit the expected features of these topological phases : notably the metallic surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of these surface states could be probed by studying the ( spin - resolved ) collective modes of the atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> since we work close to the nearly free electron limit , the required temperature scale is set by the recoil energy , which is of the order of in the case of @xmath24yb , easily accessible in experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the realization of these topological bandstructures in ultracold atomic gases will allow the study of interesting properties that can not readily be explored in solid state systems . </S>",
    "<S> an important issue concerns the effects of ( attractive or repulsive ) interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> weak interactions can affect the properties of the surface modes , while strong interactions may drive the system into strongly - correlated topological phases , either with trs preserved@xcite , or with broken trs in which case they are related to fractional quantum hall states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , cold atom implementations will allow studies of the effects of tuning the nature of the bands , inducing transitions in their topology . introducing a phase difference between the electric fields in ( [ eq : coupling ] ) </S>",
    "<S> breaks trs ; this could be used to study quantum phase transitions out of the @xmath0 topological insulator phase , into ( for example ) integer quantum hall states .    </S>",
