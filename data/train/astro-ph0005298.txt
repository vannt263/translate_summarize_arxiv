    "type ib and ic supernovae ( sne ib and sne ic ) are distinguished from sne ia primarily by their lack of a strong @xmath2 si ii absorption feature in early - time spectra @xcite .",
    "their nature is still in debate due to their relative rareness @xcite and faintness @xcite .",
    "the most widely accepted scenario is the core - collapse of a massive star that has lost its hydrogen ( sn ib ) and possibly helium envelope ( sn ic ) either through a stellar wind or the effects of a close companion , although other models like the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs have not been completely excluded .",
    "currently , there is intense interest in sne ib / ic because of their possible connection with @xmath3-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "sn 1999dn , located in ngc 7714 , was discovered by @xcite on aug .",
    "19.76ut with the bao 0.6-m telescope .",
    "it was originally identified as a type ic @xcite or ib / c event @xcite .",
    "the derived velocity of the weak `` si ii @xmath4 '' absorption line is much smaller than that of other lines , which encouraged us to reconsider the line - identification and spectroscopic classification through spectrum synthesis .",
    "we used the fast parameterized lte code synow and early - time spectra observed with the bao 2.16-m telescope .",
    "the observations , spectrum synthesis procedure , and results are presented and discussed here .",
    "three spectra of sn 1999dn were obtained with the 2.16-m telescope of beijing astronomical observatory .",
    "the first spectrum was taken with bfsoc spectrograph with a 2048x2048 pixel ccd , just after the discovery of the supernova .",
    "the other two spectra were taken with the omr spectrograph with a tek 1024x1024 ccd .",
    "we used a grating of @xmath5 , whose spectral resolution is about @xmath6 .",
    "the standard iraf ( image reduction and facilities ) package was used to reduce the spectra .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .    during the reduction process",
    ", the telluric emission lines were subtracted automatically .",
    "we did not remove any telluric absorption lines from the first two spectra .",
    "we used an early - type standard star , which has no strong features in the red part of its spectrum , to obtain the profiles of the telluric lines and remove them from the third supernova spectrum .",
    "the spectra of sn 1999dn are shown in figures 1  3 .",
    "to establish line - identifications , we used the parameterized supernova spectrum - synthesis code synow to analyze the spectra of sn 1999dn .",
    "this code makes simplifying approximations , including the lte , resonant scattering , and sobolev approximations @xcite .",
    "@xcite have calculated lte sobolev line optical depths for various temperatures and for six different compositions that could be encountered in supernovae .",
    "we used their results to determine which ions should be considered in our synthesis procedure . for each ion ,",
    "the optical depth of a reference line is a fitting parameter .",
    "optical depths of the other lines for that ion are calculated assuming boltzmann excitation , with excitation temperature also a fitting parameter .",
    "the continuum is fitted with a blackbody ; its temperature @xmath7 is not assigned much physical significance .",
    "the radial dependence of the line optical depths is taken to be exponential with the e - folding velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the velocity interval within which an ion is present is characterized by such fitting parameters as the minimum and maximum velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 , and in most cases @xmath9 is the same as the velocity at the photosphere , @xmath12 . when we assign to some ion a @xmath9 that is larger than @xmath12 , we mean that this ion is detached from the photosphere .",
    "we have experimented with many combinations of fitting parameters .",
    "the best - fit synthetic spectra are compared with the observed spectra of august 21 , august 31 and september 14 in the upper panels of figure 1 , figure 2 , and figure 3 , respectively .    the synthetic spectrum of aug .",
    "21 has @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure 1 , the fe ii features from @xmath15 to @xmath16 and the ca ii ir triplet around @xmath17 are prominent .",
    "the inconspicuous absorption near @xmath18 can also be attributed to fe ii .",
    "the absorption near @xmath19 is usually attributed to o i @xmath20 , but the absorption here is too red for o i to fit it well .",
    "so we introduce mg ii @xmath21 and blend it with the o i line .",
    "both the na i d lines and he i @xmath22 are candidates for the strong p cygni feature around @xmath23 .",
    "we favor he i because it can also account for other observed features with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 lines .",
    "the absorption minimum at @xmath26 was originally identified as si ii @xmath27 @xcite , but through spectrum synthesis we have found that it is better fit by the @xmath1 line of c ii , detached at @xmath28 .",
    "c ii @xmath29 may also contribute to the absorption near @xmath15 .",
    "the observed spectrum of aug .",
    "31 is similar to that of aug .",
    "21 in the overall shape and can be synthesized with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "now the c ii @xmath1 p cygni feature becomes distinct from that of he i @xmath32 .",
    "the minimum velocity of the detached c ii is now taken to be @xmath33 .",
    "now the optical depth of fe ii is too small to produce the observed absorption around @xmath34 .",
    "we find that only [ o ii ] @xmath35 can match it while not contaminating the synthetic spectrum elsewhere .",
    "but we are not sure that whether the physical conditions to form the forbidden lines can be satisfied ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the strong p cygni feature near @xmath36 is ca ii h&k .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 to synthesize the spectrum of sep . 14 . from the upper panel of figure 3",
    ", we can see that the he i p cygni lines of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath25 are strong .",
    "he i also helps to form the observed features near @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the deep absorptions at @xmath41 and @xmath44 can be matched mostly with mg ii @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which supports our identification of this ion above .",
    "the gentle slope from @xmath47 to @xmath48 is produced by ca i lines , fe ii lines , and c ii @xmath1 detached at @xmath49 .",
    "c ii @xmath29 , blended with he i @xmath50 , can also account for the absorption at @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the absorptions at @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be partially or entirely explained by ca i. ni ii line is used to fit the absorption at @xmath54 . note the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel around this feature is @xmath55 .",
    "this ion also brings two absorption features around @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "another slope from @xmath58 to @xmath59 is explicable if na i @xmath60 and c i @xmath61 are introduced , but then the synthetic spectrum around @xmath23 and @xmath44 gets worse . for comparison",
    ", we plot the synthetic spectrum without ca i , ni ii , na i and c i as the dotted line in the upper panel of figure 3 .",
    "the optical depths of the reference lines and other fitting parameters for figure 1  figure 3 are listed in table 1  table 3 , respectively .",
    "@xcite indicated that the spectra of sn 1999dn were very similar to that of sn 1997x and identified it as a type ib / c event in accordance with the previous classification of the latter @xcite , while others noted both as type ic supernovae @xcite .",
    "but by comparing the spectrum of sn 1999dn in aug .",
    "30 and of sn 1997x , presented by @xcite , with that of the prototypical type ib sn 1984l of aug .",
    "30 , plotted by @xcite in their figure 3 , one can see that those three spectra , all near maximum light , strikingly resemble each other almost in all features and differ with the early - time spectrum of type ic supernovae mainly in two aspects : ( 1 ) the he i optical p cygni lines of sn 1999dn , sn 1997x and sn 1984l are prominent , while in the prototypical type ic sn 1994i he i line are hardly discernible , although @xcite claimed evidence of very weak he i lines in spectra with good signal - to - noise ratio ; and ( 2 ) unlike the @xmath2 absorption feature usually seen in the early - time spectra of sne ic , the minimum at @xmath62 in sn 1999dn , sn 1997x and sn 1984l is hard to attribute to si ii @xmath27 , as demonstrated in the lower panels of figure 1  figure 3 .",
    "it has been supposed that c ii @xmath1 is responsible for this feature in sne ib @xcite ; this is supported by our spectrum synthesis here and in particular by the identification of c ii @xmath63 in the sep .",
    "14 spectrum of sn 1999dn .",
    "we regard both sn 1999dn and sn 1997x as typical type ib supernovae .",
    "the relative strengths of the he i lines @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath25 can not be completely fitted by synow . in figure 1 and figure 2 , we choose to fit @xmath22 best , and then @xmath24 , @xmath25 are somewhat weaker than observed . in figure 3",
    ", the calculated @xmath32 is the right strength , but @xmath22 is too strong and @xmath64 is too weak .",
    "such nlte effects may be caused by nonthermal excitation from comptonized gamma rays released in the decay of @xmath65 that has been mixed into the helium envelope @xcite .",
    "note the ni ii line which we introduced above to fit the @xmath54 absorption in the spectrum of sep .",
    "this could be direct early - time spectral evidence of @xmath65 mixing in the explosion of a type ib supernova .",
    "as for the aug .",
    "31 spectrum , despite its poor signal - to - noise ratio , we are sure that the introduction of ni ii lines to the synthetic spectrum can not improve the fit",
    ". the velocity upper limit of the mixed @xmath66 may be @xmath67 , which is larger than the value predicted by explosion simulations @xcite .",
    "one question remains of the minimum velocity of c ii that we used to explain the absorption near @xmath68 .",
    "why should this ion be detached around @xmath28 at the earliest times , but then detached at a much lower velocity of @xmath69 on sep .",
    "does it imply two different c ii velocity components in the helium layer ?",
    "an alternative scenario that seems more attractive and probable , is that at the earliest times this feature is produced by @xmath0 , which always fits as well as c ii @xmath1 ( see the dotted lines in the lower panels of figure 1  figure 3 ) . in the aug .",
    "21 and aug .",
    "31 spectra , h i would be detached by @xmath33 and @xmath70 , respectively . in the sep .",
    "14 spectrum , on the other hand , the identification of c ii @xmath1 is unambiguous because h i can not explain the observed absorption at @xmath42 . actually , on aug .",
    "31 a contribution from c ii can not be excluded because the observed feature is stronger than in aug .",
    "21 and sep . 14 .",
    "the other synthesized h i lines like @xmath71 are swamped by fe ii lines and are too weak to be identified .    to summarize ,",
    "we suppose that a thin high - velocity hydrogen skin exits outside of the helium layer in sn 1999dn , with @xmath72 appearing only before and near maximum light . as the envelope expands and the photosphere recedes deeper into the helium layer , the optical depth of @xmath0 diminishes naturally and eventually is overwhelmed by c ii @xmath1 .",
    "we note that other authors @xcite have presented some evidence , though inconclusive , of @xmath0 in some type ic supernovae , especially sn 1987 m , and argued that sne ii and sne ic have similar physical origins .",
    "similarly , our identification of @xmath0 in sn 1999dn provides a link between the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of type ib supernovae and type iib events such as 1987k and 1993j .",
    "we would like to thank all observational astronomers at the 2.16 m telescope of bao , in particular j. y. wei , d. w. xu and l. cao , for their help in our observations of sn 1999dn .",
