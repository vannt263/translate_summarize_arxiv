    "understanding the 3d structure of dust is crucial for studies of spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition to detailing the complex structure of the ism an accurate representation of dust is necessary to correct measurements of starlight .",
    "this is important for a variety of studies including e.g. , the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , where the behavior of the dust as a function of inclination is required to correct integrated photometry @xcite ; constructing rotation curves of highly inclined galaxies , since attenuation can censor the rotation curve s inner rise , leading to erroneous mass models @xcite ; correcting measurements of disk kinematics for the asymmetric amount of dust extinction above and below the disk of face - on spirals @xcite ; and producing accurate radial surface - brightness profiles corrected for spurious broken - exponential morphologies caused by dust absorption @xcite .",
    "spirals with inclinations at or near 90@xmath4 ( known as edge - ons ) provide the best information about the vertical structure of the dust , both because the corrections for viewing angle are small but also because the dust is projected into easy to see lanes that can attenuate the midplane by more than 10 mag in the optical @xcite . as a result",
    "edge - ons are an important component to our knowledge of dust structure .",
    "separating the individual components of a dust - light mixture of unknown composition is a difficult endeavor , and is frequently done via radiative - transfer ( rt ) modeling .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) rt models , used in astrophysics since the 1970s ( for a discussion of early models see @xcite ) , have been extensively employed to probe the structure of edge - on spirals .",
    "recently , these models have come into prominent usage ( e.g. @xcite ) , spurred by the need to precisely track multiple scatterings off dust grains . while costlier than the direct analytical approach of @xcite in terms of cpu time , increases in processor speed and ram limits coupled with rapidly dropping costs now allow detailed monte carlo models to be run on relatively short timescales .",
    "in addition , the current trend in high - performance computing is towards increased numbers of cpus at slower clock speeds ; this is also a benefit to monte carlo methods , as they are exceedingly well suited to parallelization and thrive in a distributed environment .",
    "ngc 891 is the most studied nearby ( d@xmath59.5 mpc ) edge - on spiral galaxy in the universe .",
    "it is almost exactly edge - on ( @xmath6 @xcite ) , with a rotation speed ( 212 km / s ) similar to that of the milky way . because the dust morphology of edge - ons appears to change significantly between galaxies with rotation speeds above and below 130 km sec@xmath7 @xcite , comparing the milky way with other fast - rotating systems is especially relevant .",
    "ngc 891 is also one of the first galaxies discovered to have high - latitude hi , a discovery prompted by observations of high - latitude hi in our own galaxy @xcite . indeed , ngc 891 s potential as an analogue of the milky way is what aroused much of the early interest in this extragalactic system @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence for a strong two - armed spiral pattern like that seen in grand design spirals such as m51 has emerged based on asymmetry in h@xmath8 and b band emission @xcite .",
    "ngc 891 appears to have a bar @xcite as well as a nearby companion ( ugc 1807 , @xcite ) , both of which dramatically increase the likelihood of the aforementioned grand design pattern being real @xcite .",
    "ngc 891 is also known for its abundance of high - latitude dust and complex dust substructure .",
    "given the significant high - latitude hi found in ngc 891 , it is not surprising to also find dust away from the midplane .",
    "@xcite used unsharp masks to study individual high - latitude dust clumps in ngc 891 , and later found evidence that these extended substructures may be common to most spirals @xcite .",
    "if high - latitude dust caused by star - formation induced outflows is indeed abundant in spiral galaxies , it would act as a foreground screen preferentially over the star - forming spiral arms , increasing the apparent optical depth in the arms without increasing total dust content .",
    "while unsharp masks are very useful for enhancing clumpy substructure the masking process destroys quantitative information about the clumps .",
    "therefore , a new procedure for highlighting the dust that preserves this information is needed .    because there are some indicators of spirality and significant extraplanar dust component , ngc 891 is a clear example of the need for advanced 3d modeling which takes into account these features .",
    "indeed , studies attempting to use smooth , axisymmetric models on ngc 891 have had significant difficulty in fitting the data due to the asymmetry in blue light .",
    "@xcite split the galaxy in half and used an infinitely long thin disk of stellar emission to reconcile the left and right hand sides of ngc 891 in the b and v bands , while additional dust and light components have been required by smooth models to fit ngc 891 s mid - infrared emission @xcite .",
    "some groups have added clumpy / non - axisymmetric structure to rt models of edge - on spirals ( e.g. @xcite ) ; however they restrict their analysis to a small range of clumpy models , with dust modeled by hand or based on results for the milky way .    in this work",
    "we quantitatively fit the _ first _ rt models to include both dust clumping and realistic spirality to f450w and f814w hubble images of ngc 891 .",
    "these rt models resemble real spiral galaxies from any inclination angle , allowing us to make accurate inferences about the dust properties of galaxies like ngc 891 as seen at all inclinations . in section",
    "[ sec : obsconsts ] we present the archival data used in this work and our methods of analysis . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we discuss the parameter space of our model , our fitting algorithm , and our fitness metric .",
    "we present our results , including a brief _ post - facto _ analysis of our shapelet - based fitness metric , in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the photometric properties of our models and compare them to the literature .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we downloaded hst wfpc2 images of the central region of ngc 891 from the hubble legacy archive in the f450w and f814w bandpasses ( hereafter referred to a b and i band , respectively ) . for s / n per pixel @xmath5",
    "10 the data go down to a limiting mag of @xmath318.5 stmag , where @xmath9 has units of erg @xmath10 s@xmath7 @xmath11@xcite . ]",
    "mag arcsec@xmath12 for both b and i bands .",
    "the images were rotated in order to make the galaxy midplane horizontal , and then smoothed to a resolution of @xmath30.9  ( roughly 42 pc at the adopted distance of 9.5 mpc ) to match the resolution of the models . due to the large size of the galaxy on",
    "the wfpc2 images the sky had been oversubtracted in the reduced , archival data .",
    "we corrected the sky subtraction while scaling and centering the images by comparing the data to smooth , axisymmetric rt models constructed exactly from the b and i band parameters given in @xcite .",
    "this procedure was iterative : starting from a guess of the offsets , we computed a linear least - squares fit between individual pixels from the model images and their analogues in the shifted data frames .",
    "the best - fitting shift is the one required to center the image , while the slope and y - offset of the best fit are the flux calibration and background offset , respectively .",
    "we then masked out bright foreground stars and background galaxies from the images .",
    "these masks were homogenized between the b and i bands , then preserved so we could identically mask all of our models before fitting them to the data .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the clumpy and non - axisymmetric distribution of star - light and dust in ngc 891 .",
    "to do so , we introduce two new metrics to characterize the data and our models .",
    "these metrics are designed to evaluate the performance of these models in matching the data compared to axisymmetric models with smooth star - light and dust distributions .",
    "first , we motivate the concept of attenuation , from which we construct a differential index of the attenuation relative to a smooth model .",
    "this index allows us to leverage the most important observable differences between smooth and clumpy distributions of dust .",
    "second , with the use of models with clumpy distributions of dust , it is no longer tractable to find a model that looks identical to the data ( as done in all prior smooth model analyses ) .",
    "we apply a method from the literature for making orthogonal decompositions of two - dimensional light distributions .",
    "these characterizations are used to statistically compare and contrast the observed and modeled differential attenuation maps .          whenever dust grains are mixed with a distribution of stellar emissivity the traditional notion of dust as a purely foreground screen no longer applies ; instead what we observe for systems such as galaxies is the _ attenuation _",
    "@xmath13 at wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "the attenuation can be defined in analogy to the foreground extinction , @xmath15 , by the ratio of the observed or modeled line - of - sight flux in the presence of dust ( @xmath16 ) to the line - of - sight flux ( of a model ) in the absence of dust ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 in general , @xmath13 is dependent on the underlying distribution of emissivity , absorption , and scattering .",
    "consequently , @xmath13 is _ not _ related simply to the dust optical depth , and hence can not be used to derive directly the underlying dust column density .",
    "previous radiative transfer modeling of galaxies which fit models to images ( e.g. , @xcite ) have constrained smooth distributions of stars and dust by fitting directly to the observed , two - dimensional light distribution at different wavelengths .",
    "to first order , our clumpy dust models must reproduce this basic two - dimensional light distribution _ on average_. however , if we try to fit clumpy models directly to the observed light distribution , the solution will be degenerate since there will be many combinations of clumpy dust and star - light that either ( a ) will result in the same observed intensity along a given line of sight ; or ( b ) will result in similar net deviations ( in a @xmath19 sense ) from the observed data .",
    "because of these degeneracies ( whereby a wide range of astrophysically distinct models yield similar goodness of fit to the data ) , fitting clumpy models to the observed light distribution is not particularly meaningful . instead , what is meaningful is to determine the similarity of the _ statistical deviations _ of the light - distributions of the data and models with respect to some fiducial distribution .",
    "since we are interested in understanding the importance of clumpy dust , the best fiducial distribution is a model consisting of a smooth light and dust distribution that best approximates the data .",
    "hence , instead of directly comparing our clumpy models to the data , we use differential attenuation ( @xmath20 ) maps .",
    "similar to the attenuation @xmath13 , these images are created by taking the ratio of the observed flux or non - axisymmetric model flux to the flux distribution of a fiducial , axisymmetric , smooth model : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the flux from the fiducial model .",
    "the fiducial model is comprised of starlight and dust , and can be parameterized in terms of its own attenuation @xmath23 and the same model without dust ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 the differential attenuation can then be expressed as a function of the underlying stellar distributions and the attenuation of the data / clumpy model and the smooth model : @xmath26 if the fiducial model s light distribution , integrated along the line - of - sight in the absence of dust , is a reasonable approximation to the astrophysical object or clumpy model ( also in the absence of dust ) , then the first term is negligible . in general",
    "the choice of fiducial model is relatively unimportant as long as it is held constant for the entire analysis since the mismatch can be treated as a pedestal value to @xmath20 .",
    "we choose the axisymmetric , smooth model described in @xcite and table 1 of @xcite as our fiducial .",
    "the observed @xmath20 and the ingredients are shown for ngc 891 in figure [ fig : idataextmapdemo ] .",
    "the left panel shows a smoothed i band hst image , the center panel shows an image of the smooth model created using our mc rt software , and the right panel shows the ratio of the other two panels  the @xmath27 map .",
    "it is important to note two things about the @xmath27 maps .",
    "first , these maps do not represent the _ true _ attenuation because the axisymmetric models include a smooth dust disk : the @xmath27 map is really showing the excess or dearth of attenuation due to non - axisymmetric components ( such as spiral arms and clumps ) .",
    "for instance , the @xmath28 map ( and to a lesser extent @xmath29 map ) shows a long , thin structure running across the middle of the galaxy with greater than expected attenuation ( highlighted in figure [ fig : idataextmapdemo ] ) . this feature is angled off of the midplane and resembles what would be expected from a warped outer spiral arm .",
    "a warp in ngc 891 would help explain its significant extraplanar gas emission from ionized and neutral gas @xcite , although @xcite indicate that a warp is unlikely . by highlighting these structures",
    "the @xmath30 maps focus our model fitness parameters on the higher order structure that we are searching to constrain .",
    "second , the @xmath27 maps ability to highlight dust substructure is similar to the unsharp masks used by @xcite ; however , by using the attenuation instead of an unsharp mask we are able to bring out the substructure _ without _ destroying the quantitative information in the image ( a byproduct of any algorithm involving smoothing ) .",
    "this is a significant advantage over unsharp masking because it allows us to compute quantitative values that can be directly compared to physical models .",
    "the problem of identifying ways to characterize clumpy models and compare them meaningfully to data has been taken up in the literature .",
    "however , the solution to date has been to turn away from modeling the observed spatial distribution of light ( as done in all prior smooth model analyses ) , and towards fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the latter essentially compresses all the model images into a single dimension , which can then be fit using a simple @xmath31 analysis .",
    "however this method throws away all spatial information , which is essential for testing physical models where stellar emission , absorption , scattering , and thermal re - emission are not necessarily co - spatial processes . by ignoring spatial information modelers also run the risk of finding false minima , simulations that fit the sed but do not look like real galaxies ( for an example of this see @xcite ) .",
    "another approach to constraining clumpy models which does not throw away spatial information , is to construct a suitable statistical descriptor of the galaxy image structure ( here we use @xmath27 for the structure image ) .",
    "one must find a way to measure the statistical properties of the image that is able to equate two systems with the same underlying _ distribution _ of structure .",
    "the human eye is very good at this task , and `` by - eye '' image fitting has had some success ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to create rigorous and well - constrained clumpy models a computerized , quantitative tool to measure image structure is needed . as a first step in this new direction",
    "we employ shapelet analysis to generate model fitnesses .",
    "shapelet analysis , first described by @xcite , is a method for decomposing an image into orthogonal basis functions using weighted hermite polynomials . a cousin of wavelets , shapelets are optimized for the more circular features generally found in astronomy .",
    "the shapelet methodology creates orthogonal basis functions based on hermite polynomials : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hermite polynomial of order of positive integer @xmath34 .",
    "these 1d basis functions are combined to produce a dimensional 2d basis function : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is a constant scaling factor used to scale the size of the shapelets .",
    "the number of counts in an image pixel is then equal to the infinite sum of the shapelet basis functions multiplied by the shapelet coefficients , given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the counts for a given pixel . for a much more thorough description see @xcite .",
    "traditionally shapelets have been used to model spatially small galaxies at a low number of fourier modes ( e.g. @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "we are trying to deconstruct objects on size scales ranging from a few pixels ( dust clumps ) to the size of the image ( the bulge and disk ) and therefore must go to much higher order in shapelet space .",
    "we choose to go to 50th order along the major axis and 25th order along the minor axis , based on a comparison of sample reconstructions of the smoothed hst images .",
    "going to these higher orders allows us to capture much of the structural detail .",
    "exploring such high order shapelets is possible because shapelet deconvolution is a relatively efficient procedure , especially compared to the time it takes to run our rt models .",
    "additionally , parts of the process are parallelizable ( e.g. computing shapelet coefficients ) , a fact we take full advantage of wherever possible .",
    "a sample reconstruction using the selected orders is shown in figures [ fig : reconimg ] and [ fig : shapeletrecon ] .",
    "reconstructing the image to less than infinite orders imposes a penalty on image resolution ; the reconstructed image appears slightly smoothed , roughly equivalent to boxcar - smoothing the image with a radius of one pixel .",
    "the pixelization of the image , pixel - to - pixel noise , and the rapidly increasing computational expense inhibit the use of higher orders . even though the shapelets we use are designed for circular objects ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) we find that they are able to accurately reproduce the oblong features of edge - on spirals as well as the clumpy dust .",
    "including both spirality and dust clumping adds many free parameters to the rt models . because many of these parameters are new to the modeling literature , we can not simply adopt values based on results from previous studies .",
    "consequently , our parameter space is very large and so we employ a genetic algorithm to maximize our efficiency at finding good solutions .",
    "such an algorithm is well suited to comparing a statistical goodness - of - fit constructed from the amplitude distribution of the shapelet decomposition of @xmath39 .",
    "we use the 3d scattered light monte carlo rt model developed by k. wood , which has been used in a variety of different astrophysical environments ( for example see @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "we will summarize the relevant details here ; for a full description of the code see @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo model tracks individual packets of photons through a model consisting of a 3d cartesian grid , where each cell has a fixed dust density .",
    "the packets are transmitted , absorbed , or scattered in a given cell based on the results of random numbers weighted by the physical properties of the dust and its density in that cell .",
    "the temperature of the dust is not tracked ; our scattered - light model does not re - emit absorbed photons  once they are absorbed , they are terminated .",
    "we ignored the effects of dust emission in this work , although uv - excited extended red emission ( the so - called ere : @xcite ) might contribute modestly to the i - band light of ngc 891 at high latitudes .",
    "the advantage of using a scattered - light rt code is computational  models can be run faster and with higher resolution than if we used rt software which tracked absorption and re - emission of dust .",
    "our model employs a forced first scattering algorithm , where all photon packets are scattered at least once @xcite .",
    "we also use a peeling off formula @xcite , which directs a fraction of each photon packet s light toward the observer regardless of the packet s nominal direction . both of these modifications allow us to achieve a higher s / n for a given number of emitted photon packets with minimal loss in accuracy .",
    "we use a grid of 1000x1000x500 cells , which is mapped to a spatial volume of 40x40x20 kpc .",
    "this gives us a resolution of @xmath30.9  at a distance of 9.5 mpc .",
    "because our simulations are at such high resolution , we have parallelized the monte carlo code to run on a 12-core processor .",
    "as described below , we include multiple components to characterize both the stellar emissivity and dust density , using a very similar parameterization to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we model the stellar emission as a smooth spatial distribution with non - axisymmetric components in the form of spiral arms .",
    "further , emission is treated completely separately for each band to take into account the change in dominant stellar population as a function of wavelength .",
    "this is in line with the models of @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "the emissivity is governed by the following equation : @xmath40 the first part of this expression describes an elliptical de vaucouleurs bulge , where @xmath41 is the bulge emissivity of the central cell and @xmath42 is an intermediate quantity containing information about the bulge effective radius @xmath43 , semimajor axis @xmath44 , and semiminor axis",
    "@xmath45 : @xmath46 the second part of equation ( [ eq : emissivity ] ) controls a double - exponential disk , where @xmath47 is the disk emissivity of the central cell , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the scale - length and -height , respectively .",
    "the third component , @xmath50 , is the logarithmic spiral disk perturbation , and expands into @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the cartesian coordinates , @xmath54 is the fraction of light ( or dust , see  [ sec : dust ] ) entrained in the arms , and @xmath55 is the pitch angle .",
    "equation [ eq : spirality ] is a modified form of logarithmic spirality in @xcite ; the main changes are the inclusion of the even - numbered exponent @xmath56 and the fixing of the spiral arms at two .",
    "the asymmetry of h@xmath8 , 60 @xmath57 m , and co emission point to ngc 891 being a classical grand design spiral @xcite , justifying the use of only two arms . in the misiriotis spirality formulation",
    "the arms and interarm regions have equal size .",
    "@xcite showed that this was not the case ; the ratio between arms to interarm regions is closer to 0.2 for grand design spirals .",
    "exponentiating the sine part of the function allows us to ( coarsely ) adjust the arm - interarm ratio ; @xmath58 roughly corresponds to the correct ratio .",
    "we have chosen the form of the spirality so that if @xmath59 it reduces to the equation in @xcite .",
    "the product in front of the equation ensures that the spiral perturbation does not change the total emissivity .",
    "horizontal orders are along the x - axis , while vertical orders are along the y - axis .",
    "lower orders are on the left and bottom , respectively .",
    "the color - bar shows the amplitude of the shapelet coefficients . ]",
    "we populate our models with the same dust geometry in all wavebands , as the dust density distribution is independent of wavelength .",
    "the rt software takes as an input the total dust+gas density , so we note that the assumption that the dust follows the gas is implicit in our models .",
    "the dust density distribution is assumed to be very similar to that of the starlight in the disk on large scales , e.g. there is no dust bulge , and hence @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the dust+gas disk density of the central cell . the scale length and height can be different than those of the stars , @xmath50 is the same basic formula as for emissivity ( equation [ eq : spirality ] ) but with ( potentially ) different values for @xmath54 , and @xmath62 represents a clumping modifier .",
    "clumpiness is governed by a fractal algorithm based on the distribution of molecular dust in the milky way @xcite and is detailed in @xcite .",
    "because the fractal algorithm is designed to mimic dust substructure on much smaller scales than we will probe , it is not known _ a priori _ how well it can reproduce the large , chimney - like structures usually taken as evidence for large scale outflows due to e.g. , supernovae .",
    "in the ideal case we would use a dynamical , turbulent model of the ism computed from hydrodynamical simulations ( like those created by @xcite ) , but using these models on galactic length scales is currently computationally infeasible .",
    "the fractal algorithm is computationally efficient and can produce a wide range of substructure .    for the physical properties of the dust grains we choose values consistent with the diffuse interstellar medium of the milky way , based on the dust model of @xcite as computed by @xcite .",
    "the adopted parameters are fairly consistent with prior efforts to fit rt models to images ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have found somewhat different dust properties , although we note that determining these parameters can be difficult ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "three parameters govern the dust physics relevant to our models : @xmath63 , the total ( dust+gas ) opacity ; @xmath44 , the albedo ; and @xmath64 , the scattering asymmetry parameter . for the b band",
    "we adopt @xmath65 @xmath66 g@xmath7 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in i",
    "we use @xmath69 @xmath66 g@xmath7 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . these values for @xmath63 correspond to an @xmath72 , marginally larger than the value of @xmath73 for a screen of dust in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the same dust model is used for both the smooth and the clumpy components of the dust distribution .",
    "we hold the bulge parameters constant using values from the smooth model of @xcite ( l@xmath74 erg s@xmath7 pc@xmath75 str@xmath7 , l@xmath76 erg s@xmath7 pc@xmath75 str@xmath7 , b / a@xmath77 = 0.6 , b / a@xmath78=0.54 , r@xmath79=1.12 kpc , and r@xmath80=1.97 kpc ) , under the assumption that the bulge should be relatively smooth and axisymmetric and is well characterized from light outside the midplane where dust absorption is minimized .",
    "this assumption is not perfect .",
    "for instance ngc 891 is known to have a bar @xcite .",
    "we choose not to fit a bar to save cpu expense in this large parameter space since our main area of interest lies in the disk and not the bulge / bar .",
    "we expect that the only change to the scale - lengths of the starlight from those reported for smooth exponential models will be due to azimuthal variations in the spiral pattern ; therefore any deviation from the @xcite values of the scale - length ( @xmath81 kpc , @xmath82 kpc ) in one band will be well correlated with deviations in the other , giving a single free @xmath83 parameter . however , while any randomly generated models follow this rule , we allow the scale - lengths to change just like the other free parameters as the models breed with each other",
    ". therefore the scale - lengths in both bands are generally highly correlated , but not perfectly so .",
    "we leave the central emissivity @xmath84 and @xmath85 and the scale - heights @xmath86 and @xmath87 as free parameters because while they are largely insensitive to spiral perturbations @xcite they are likely to be sensitive to dust clumpiness .",

    "@xcite we allow it to vary up to 50 times literature value ( we choose a fiducial @xmath61 of 0.0062 g @xmath10 kpc@xmath7 , a compromise between the b and i band values of @xcite ) ; while we do not expect such large discrepancies from the literature in @xmath61 ( or indeed , any of our free parameters ) the ability of the genetic algorithm to quickly find local minima allows us to be very ambitious in selecting our parameter space .",
    "we allow the dust perturbation strength ( @xmath102 ) and the b band perturbation strength ( @xmath98 ) to vary freely ; @xcite found that the ratio of arm strength between bands similar to b and i was about 1.2 , and we use this value to set @xmath103 .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath55 of the stellar spiral arms is also a free parameter , allowed to vary between 5 and 30 degrees , while the pitch angle of the dust lag is fixed to the emission so that the dust arms always are 5 degrees apart from the stellar arms .",
    "both the pitch angle range and dust offset angle are based on studies of face - on spiral galaxies by @xcite .",
    "we fix the position angle @xmath104 ( corresponding to the @xmath105 direction of a cylindrical coordinate system where the r and z directions are parallel to the radius and vertical extent , respectively , of the galaxy ) because our data only covers the innermost part of ngc 891 and is therefore unlikely to be sensitive to changes in @xmath104 , although we do test each model for both spiral orientations ( left - handed or right - handed ) .",
    "finally , we allow the full range of spiral perturbation strengths ( 0 to 1 ) for both stars and dust .",
    "the major parameters of the fractal algorithm are the fractal dimension @xmath106 , governing the size scale of the clumps ; @xmath100 , the number of clumps ; and @xmath107 , the fraction of the total dust density trapped in the clumps .",
    "we follow @xcite and set @xmath108 : while this is larger than the value used by @xcite it is within the observational limits found by @xcite and gives more `` fluffy '' clouds ( @xcite ; for a schematic illustration of the fractal algorithm see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "small values of @xmath100 lead to a few , isolated , clouds while large values correspond to smoother , more uniform , structures .",
    "we therefore allow @xmath100 to vary freely between 50 and 200 , which ( despite the aforementioned fact that the fractal algorithm is designed for smaller structures ) we experimentally find produces realistic looking clumpy distributions .",
    "all subsequent casts control the size and filling factor of individual clumps and are set to 32 , which we have found produces rich structure down to our resolution limit without significant added cpu expense .    after determining the distribution of clumpy regions we set the fraction of dust in the clumps .",
    "the smooth fraction @xmath101 is a free parameter which is allowed to vary between 0 and 80% of the total dust mass , observing that smooth fractions larger than 80% tend to be indistinguishable from the entirely smooth models which are uninteresting to probe in this study .",
    "the ranges of all the free parameters used in the models is shown in table [ tab : parameterspace ] .      with a total of 13 free parameters",
    ", we also wanted to understand how well constrained our model was .",
    "to that end , we also ran a set of models with a significantly reduced parameter space .",
    "we fixed both the scale - length and scale - height for the stars and the dust at the values of our fiducial model ( @xmath81 kpc , @xmath82 kpc , @xmath91 kpc , @xmath92 kpc , @xmath109 kpc , and @xmath110 kpc ) , and set the stellar spiral perturbation strength @xmath98 ( 0.4 ) and pitch angle @xmath55 ( 15@xmath4 ) equivalent to values consistent with sb galaxies @xcite .",
    "this leaves us with a total of only six free parameters for our ` constrained ' models .",
    "additionally , we examined our decision to fix the @xmath104 by running a subset of 8 models with the full set of 13 free parameters as well as varying the @xmath104 between 0 and 180 degrees .",
    "these 8 models are heareafter referred to as the ` free - pa ' models .",
    "we investigate how changing our free parameters in this way affects our resulting models in  [ consistency ] .",
    "our total number of free parameters is 13 .",
    "this presents an algorithmical challenge , as it would take prohibitively long to do a brute - force search of parameter space .",
    "what is required , then , is an algorithm that can efficiently search through a parameter space without deeply probing regions with only poor fits to the data .",
    "multiple approaches exist for this problem , but we choose a genetic algorithm both for its simplicity and efficiency .    genetic algorithms take their inspiration from the evolutionary principles of natural selection .",
    "a population of models is created , then their fitnesses are computed .",
    "the model with the best fitness is cloned , and passed on unchanged to the next generation .",
    "individual models then pseudo - randomly pair off to breed to populate the next generation with the same number of models , where models with better fitnesses are statistically more likely to breed more often . the gene pool is refreshed either through the occasional influx of new models or through random mutations of existing models , thereby avoiding population stagnation .",
    "if the fitness criterion is adequate at discriminating between ` good ' and ` bad ' models a genetic algorithm will rapidly converge to a local minimum .",
    "due to the continuous mixing of parameters and introduction of new ones the genetic algorithm is capable of skipping lightly over poor local minima and quickly finding a relatively deep local minima .",
    "after this point increasing the number of generations has little effect , as the minimum is too deep for mutations or breeding with new models to easily climb out and find a better one . at this point",
    "the genetic algorithm becomes little better than a monte carlo analysis .",
    "therefore , the optimal way to run a genetic algorithm is to determine roughly how long it takes for the algorithm to converge on a good minimum ( usually through running empirical test models ) , then run multiple iterations of the algorithm only up to that number of generations to map out the deep local minima .    because the genetic algorithm spends little time searching through bad regions of parameter space , adding unconstrainable free parameters to the model does not significantly increase computing time .",
    "therefore , while we may not expect all 13 of our free parameters to be well - constrained ( e.g. the spirality parameters ) including them does not strongly affect run - time or ` pollute ' well - constrained parameters .    our genetic algorithm is based on that of @xcite , who used it to study the orbit of ngc 205 , a satellite of m31 .",
    "our algorithm is very similar to theirs ; the reader is referred there for more detail .",
    "our modifications are small : we use eight models in each generation instead of five , we replace all but the best model with random ones every eight generations to prevent population stagnation , and we use a single fitness indicator instead of trying to combine several as they do .          in our approach ,",
    "shapelet analysis produces a map of the contribution to the reconstructed @xmath27 image at all possible combinations of orders .",
    "however , we do not use this map to model @xmath27 images for comparison on a pixel - by - pixel basis with the observed @xmath27 image .",
    "this is because the detailed spatial variations of @xmath27 are dependent on random variables ( in reality due to the stochastic nature of star formation ; in the models by construction ) .",
    "consequently a direct comparison in image - space is swamped by the mis - match in random structure .",
    "in contrast , however , the relative amplitudes of shapelet coefficients do capture the power in structures at different spatial frequencies , and hence provide a good statistical descriptor of the physical distribution of emission , absorption , and scattering .",
    "therefore we use the shapelet coefficients directly to compute a fitness statistic : @xmath111 where @xmath34 and @xmath112 are the shapelet orders , and @xmath113 is the shapelet coefficient magnitude at order n , m .",
    "equal weights are given to each coefficient , and by not adding in quadrature we prevent the largest coefficients ( usually in the lowest orders , governing the large - scale structure ) from dominating the fitness .",
    "the fitnesses of each filter are added in quadrature , and the geometric orientation with the best combined fitness is used in the genetic algorithm . using this merit",
    "function the genetic algorithm essentially matches each coefficient to the same absolute tolerance , automatically adjusting the tolerance from large to small as it improves the fit over the course of several generations .",
    "the hst images only cover the inner @xmath39 kpc of ngc 891 so we only output model images that cover a corresponding area .",
    "this results in images that are @xmath114 pixels , where 1 pixel = 1 projected cell .",
    "we choose to simulate a much larger volume than we need so that we can produce images showing the full model galaxy with the same random clumping behavior ( because of the semi - random nature of the clumps changing the grid volume would change the clump distribution , even when holding the random seed constant ) .",
    "however , in our genetic algorithm we only allow photons to be emitted along the central 10 kpc of the disk ( 5 kpc in radius ) in both the y and z directions ( where x is along the line of sight ) which allows us to obtain higher s / n with fewer photons .",
    "empirically , we determine that a model with 5 million photons emitted with the above restriction produces acceptable images .    on a 2.93 ghz 12-core machine",
    "each band for ngc 891 takes approximately 2 - 3 minutes to run for a single set of model parameters , which is by far the time - limiting step in the genetic algorithm .",
    "we find that the genetic algorithm has largely settled into a local minimum after 50 8-model generations , so we truncate the algorithm there .",
    "even with only 50 generations each run of the genetic algorithm takes about a day , so while it would be ideal to use more generations per run ( @xcite use 1000 ) we opt to limit the number of generations and therefore have time for more runs .",
    "even so , time constraints limit our final sample to only 30 runs .",
    "each run contains up to 351 distinct models ( @xmath115 models total ) , but we only select the best model from each run for our analysis . while 30 runs does not allow us to make the detailed analysis of parameters found in @xcite , it does allow us to make a broader survey of the parameter space . for our parameter space tests , we used 8 runs for the models with variable @xmath104 added to the normal 13 free parameters and a full 30 runs for the constrained set of models containing only 6 free parameters .              in figures [ fig : fitnessplot1][fig : fitnessplot3 ] we show histograms and plots of the free parameters in our clumpy models , as well as ( where appropriate ) our ` free-@xmath104 ' and ` constrained ' models .",
    "figure [ fig : fitnessplot1 ] contains histograms of the central b band emissivity @xmath84 , central dust+gas density @xmath61 , and b band scale - length @xmath83 overplotted with the appropriate values of the smooth , single - disk model of @xcite which we used as the basis for our clumpy models .",
    "while there is significant scatter in all three parameters , on average our models prefer slightly lower central b band emissivities , slightly higher central dust densities , and b band scale - lengths roughly equivalent to those of the smooth model .",
    "there is significant scatter for most of the individual parameters .",
    "while initially this may seem to indicate that our models are unconstrained , a closer inspection reveals that the scatter for individual parameters hides deeper correlations between multiple parameters , indicating that there are several strong joint constraints .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fitnessplot2 ] we plot several noticeable relationships between the parameters shown in figure [ fig : fitnessplot1 ] and the other emissivity and scale parameters .",
    "values for the @xcite model are shown with red stars , or blue ( b band ) and red ( i band ) stars when data from both bands are plotted simultaneously . in all cases the values for the smooth model fall within the bivariate distributions of our clumpy models . for reference ,",
    "the data from the ` free - pa ' and ` constrained ' subsets of models are shown ( where appropriate ) as open circles and open squares , respectively .",
    "first , there is a correlation between redder central emissivities and fainter central b band emissivity ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]a ) , but the correlation is in excess of what would arise for a constant i band emissivity . in other words ,",
    "model disks with fainter central b band emissivity tend to have relatively higher central i band emissivity .",
    "figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]b shows that as the radial size of the dust disk is inversely proportional to the central dust density : larger dust disks have more diffuse dust . in terms of the relative size scales of the dust and stellar disks , the b band radial scale - length is comparable to the dust scale - length ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]c ) , with a mean ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "however , as the size of the dust disk increases the relative size of the b band stellar disk decreases , with the largest dust disks having @xmath116 .",
    "the stellar vertical scale - heights of our clumpy models are typically twice that of the dust , with a positive correlation between b band radial scale- _ length _ and the ratio of b band scale - height to the dust scale - height .",
    "( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]d ) .",
    "hence the dust oblateness is roughly half that of the stars .",
    "the oblateness of the stellar disk in the b ( blue ) and i ( red ) bands increases modestly with the stellar radial scale - length ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]e ) , departing somewhat from the empirical relationship between oblateness and scale - length derived by @xcite .",
    "the stellar disks are slightly larger in the b band than the i band , and both bands are somewhat flatter than typical galaxies of comparable size and hubble type .",
    "we find little degeneracy in the models between intrinsic vertical color gradients in the stellar emissivity and varying scale - heights of dust to stars : in figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]f there is little correlation between the ratio of the b and i band scale - heights and the ratio of the b band scale - height to the dust scale - height ( bottom right ) .",
    "finally , we plot histograms of parameters related to the spirality and clumpiness in figure [ fig : fitnessplot3 ] . while there is significant scatter , fully two - thirds of our models have at least 50% of their b band emission and dust density tied up in spiral arms with a preferred pitch angle of about 20@xmath4 .",
    "however , we also find that our models do nt show a strong preference for the _ direction _ of spirality ( left- or right - handedness ) .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the spirality is not well constrained in or simulations , and as a result we do not present a thorough analysis of the spirality parameters .",
    "our models do show a strong preference towards having a significant amount of dust entrained in clumps ; 27 of the 30 best fitting models have smooth dust fractions @xmath101 smaller than 0.6 , which means that 90% of the best fitting models have @xmath117 of their total dust mass arranged into clumps .",
    "the median clumpiness fraction @xmath107 is 58% , which is a factor of only 1.2 smaller than current clumpy estimates fitting to the energy balance solely through seds @xcite .",
    "the number of clumps ( governed by @xmath100 ) is generally fairly large , with a slight preference for @xmath118 .",
    "these parameters combine to give our models significant amounts of non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "the subset of models with variable position angle converge at @xmath104s varying between 61 and 170@xmath4 , with a median value of 109@xmath4 .",
    "the lack of models with @xmath104s between 0 and 60@xmath4 is intriguing , as it indicates that even with the restricted image coverage of hst our models may have some sensitivity to spiral parameters .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ fig : fitnessplot2 ] , the ` free - pa ' models do not have different physical parameters from the full sample , indicating that our assumption of a fixed @xmath104 does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the ` constrained ' sample , however , does appear to have a distribution of central luminosities that is , on average , fainter than for the full sample .",
    "while initially surprising , on closer inspection this discrepancy is a function of fixing the scale - lengths of the models : the literature value for @xmath96 is larger than most of the fitted scale - lengths of the full sample ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]c ) .",
    "this drives the central dust density down ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]b ) , which also lowers the central luminosities .",
    "it is worth noting that our full , unrestricted sample appears to produce a tighter correlation between color and luminosity ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot2]a ) than the ` constrained ' sample .",
    "this , along with the lack of significant systematic differences between the ` constrained ' and full samples for any of the non - axisymmetric parameters ( figure [ fig : fitnessplot3 ] ) leads us to conclude that our full models are as well - constrained as the ` constrained ' sample and a better match to the observational data .      because of the large variations in the parameters of our best fitting models , we check to make sure the shapelet coefficients are properly optimizing our models . in figures [ fig : bestbband ] and [ fig : bestiband ] we show the best fitting model out of all the runs , compared to the hst images .",
    "our model is optimizing towards a plausible representation for the global light and dust distribution of ngc 891 .    to investigate how well our shapelet - amplitude statistic performs as a fitness indicator ( and to get a better overall view of the range of models selected by the genetic algorithm ) we show a sample ( 20% ) of the best - fitting clumpy models in figure [ fig : modelimages ] .",
    "the images are representative of variation seen in the 30 models from all the genetic algorithm runs .",
    "overall it is clear that the shapelet - derived fitness in the @xmath27 images is doing an adequate job of picking models that globally resemble ngc 891 .",
    "the luminous bumps in @xmath27 seen to the left and right of the bulge in some of the models ( see e.g. , the bottom panels of figure [ fig : modelimages ] ) are due to the spiral arms . these images also show that our formalism can create models with significant clumpy , non - asymmetric structure .",
    "however , even the clumpiest - looking models in our sample lack the high - z tendrils often described as vertically oriented `` chimney''-like structures .",
    "this discrepancy may indicate that the fractal algorithm is unable to produce the necessary substructure to mimic those seen in massive , edge - on galaxies , and highlights the need for physically motivated dynamical models for the ism ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "while the dust chimneys seen in images of ngc 891 and other edge - on galaxies are visually striking , their effect on the global photometric properties of galaxies is likely to be small .",
    "the chimneys apparent stochasticity and likely origin in large outflows implies that properly modeling them would not significantly change the free parameters such as dust mass , scale - height , or central emissivities .",
    "similarly , they are likely to be very localized , foreground structures and as such should play a relatively minimal role in determining total attenuation corrections at all inclinations .    in an attempt to gain more insight into how our algorithm matches and mismatches the observed complex dust structures , we have examined the shapelet amplitude distributions of the 30 best - fitting models . we plot histograms of the magnitudes of the shapelet coefficients at all x , y orders for the hst images and our models in figure [ fig : bandhists ] .",
    "the peak of the coefficient histograms of the clumpy models occurs at a lower coefficient magnitude than the peak for the reconstruction of the hst data in both b and i , although the peaks are less separated in the i band  possibly due to the b band s increased sensitivity to dust attenuation .",
    "the clumpy model reconstructions in both bands also have more coefficients at the largest magnitudes .",
    "the lack of medium - magnitude coefficients in the clumpy models means that most of the power lies in just a few coefficients with large magnitudes , producing less rich substructure than seen in reconstructions of the data .",
    "we also investigated the even vs. odd distribution of the shapelet coefficients , by comparing the sums of the coefficient magnitudes in the even orders with those in the odd orders .",
    "this was prompted by inspection of shapelet coefficient maps like the one shown in figure [ fig : shapeletrecon ] , which has a sawtooth - like pattern of coefficients .",
    "we find an even - to - odd ratio of @xmath31 for both observed bands .",
    "our models , however , tend towards much higher ratios , which can be seen in figure [ fig : evenvodd ] .",
    "this trend is apparent when coefficients that are even in the x ( horizontal ) or y ( vertical ) dimension are used , and is another indicator that it may be possible to further exploit the shapelet analysis to find more realistic models .",
    "the goal of this work was to create physically realistic rt models that would resemble real galaxies at any inclination , something that the current literature on axisymmetric structure and/or hand - added clumpiness has difficulty doing .",
    "it is clear from the results of our genetic algorithm that our spiral structure formalism is able to reproduce the general edge - on appearance of ngc 891 , which is not a surprise based on the results of @xcite . but how realistic do our best - fitting models appear at other inclinations ?    to answer this question we reran our rt code , using the same inputs for all 30 of our best - fitting models ( even down to the same random seed ) but changing the inclination angle to zero and allowing photons to be emitted from the outer parts of the disk .",
    "a representative sample of the results is shown in columns three and six of figure [ fig : modelimages ] .",
    "virtually all of the models have prominent spiral features , although there is disagreement in the handedness of the spirality .",
    "given the restricted radial range of the data , it is unsurprising that direction of the spiral arms is poorly constrained ; while we display the orientation with the best fitness most models had comparable fitnesses for spiral arms in both directions .",
    "there is also some variation in pitch angle , but for a given handedness it is relatively consistent , giving a fairly uniform look to many of these models .",
    "it is likely that at least some of the variation in spiral parameters is due to the restricted areal coverage of the hst images ; using a lower - resolution image of the full galaxy might yield stronger constraints .    whether or not the spiral parameters are well constrained , our prescription for spirality works fairly well , producing realistic - looking spiral arms .",
    "our models produce face - on images with much brighter spiral arms compared to the bulge than the typical spiral galaxy model of @xcite .",
    "compressing our spiral arms by a factor of five greatly increases their relative brightness for the same axisymmetric model parameters , preventing our models with larger pitch angles from looking like the oblong blobs in the top panel of their figure 1 .",
    "the general effect of compressing the dust into lagging spiral arms is to create lanes of absorption along the inner edges of the luminous arms . for the models with smoother dust",
    "this can be difficult to see in figure [ fig : modelimages ] .",
    "images of the face - on attenuation , @xmath13 , of the models from figure [ fig : modelimages ] are shown in the first and third columns of figure [ fig : allfaceon ] for the b and i bands , respectively .",
    "these attenuation maps are computed by comparing models with dust to models with no dust , computed using identical parameters .",
    "red regions are areas of high attenuation , while blue indicates regions with no attenuation .",
    "most ( @xmath370% ) of the models show a maximum face - on @xmath119 mag in both bands .",
    "of the few models with @xmath120 mag , none have a peak attenuation @xmath1212 mag , while the peak attenuation in the i band is @xmath31.5 mag .",
    "all models show very low attenuation at radii larger than @xmath31 @xmath88 , even for models with strong spiral features at larger radii between the center of the galaxy and the observation direction in edge - on orientation ( off the bottom of the face - on images ) .",
    "areas of peak attenuation are highly confined to the spiral arms : the average filling factor of the clumpy models for @xmath122 mag at 0.5 , 1 , and 2 @xmath88 is , respectively , 12.1 , 5.2 , and 0.4% in the b band and 5.5 , 2.5 , and 0.1% in the i band . filling factors at other thresholds",
    "are given in table [ tab : efffilfactors ] .",
    "we measured the average face - on attenuation to be @xmath123 , 0.15 , and 0.03 mag and @xmath124 , 0.10 , and 0.03 at 0.5 , 1 , and 2 scale - lengths respectively .",
    "in analogy to @xmath125 with a typical value of 3.1 measured for foreground dust screens in the milky way , we define an attenuation curve parameter @xmath126 as @xmath127 with this definition , a foreground screen of milky way - type dust has @xmath128 @xcite , and empirical estimates of the attenuation of star forming galaxies yields @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "in contrast the @xmath126 values for our clumpy models are much larger ( @xmath130 at 0.5 and 1 @xmath88 ) and become undefined ( positively infinite ) at larger radii .",
    "in other words , the attenuation is much grayer in our clumpy models than for a foreground screen , and appears to become grayer with increasing radius ( due to scattering ) .",
    "the increase in the ratio of total to selective extinction for clumpy models relative to smooth models was noted for spherical systems by ( for example ) @xcite and @xcite , as well as in more realistic models of disk galaxies by @xcite .",

    "however , @xcite find central optical depths of 0.5 - 2.0 in the v band , which for milky way - type dust is equivalent to @xmath1440.7 - 2.7 .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the inability of optical models to see to the center of the galaxy .",
    "an inspection of figure [ fig : allfaceon ] shows a wide range of dust column - density morphology ( and therefore foreground screen extinction ) but a much smaller range of appearances for the attenuation .",
    "for example , in rows two and six , the model attenuation looks fairly similar , with low levels of patchy attenuation tracing out narrow spiral arms .",
    "in contrast , the foreground screen maps are vastly different : the dust in row two is confined largely to prominent spiral arms while the dust in row six shows little coherent structure .",
    "these degeneracies imply that estimates of the attenuation based on measurements of a galaxy s extinction as a foreground screen are not well constrained  unsurprising given the complex interplay between dust and starlight in these galaxies . as important , measurements of galaxies dust content observed as a foreground screen ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) yield estimates of attenuation that are many times too large and not gray enough .          while the attenuation maps presented show where the attenuation occurs , and we can quantify the filling factor of this attenuation , neither tell us directly the light - weighted attenuation as a function of radius , i.e. what fraction of the total light in a given annulus is attenuated .",
    "therefore we construct surface brightness profiles both with and without dust for our best fitting models , as well as the smooth model from @xcite .",
    "we plot these surface brightness profiles and the difference between the models with and without dust in figure [ fig : allfaceonsbprofs ] .",
    "the residual between models with and without dust ( @xmath145 , where @xmath57 and @xmath146 denote the surface brightness in the b or i bands for models with and without dust , respectively ) , is a measure of the azimuthally - averaged attenuation as a function of radius .",
    "we find that most models have very low attenuation at all radii , with 90% of the models having @xmath147 mag at @xmath148 .",
    "average @xmath13 values at 0.5 , 1 , and 2 @xmath88 are 0.20 , 0.12 , and 0.03 mag in the b band and 0.12 , 0.08 , and 0.04 mag in the i band . in general , the clumpy dust models have both higher attenuation and more variability at all radii than the fiducial model with a smooth dust distribution and no spiral structure . additionally , the models with more attenuation also appear to have type - ii @xcite surface brightness profiles .",
    "the low amounts of face - on attenuation imply that measured kinematics of face - on galaxies are minimally affected by dust attenuation @xcite .    , compared to observed color profiles for low - inclination spiral galaxies . model bulge and disk color profiles are shown by the red and blue solid lines , respectively .",
    "the total model color profile is in black .",
    "three observed galaxy color profiles from @xcite are overlaid with dashed lines : ugc 7450 ( green ) , ugc 2064 ( orange ) , and ugc 11628 ( purple ) .",
    "these examples are discussed in the text . ]",
    "radial profiles of @xmath149 color and the attenuation color excess @xmath150 are plotted in figure [ fig : allfaceoncolorprofs ] .",
    "the inner region is unusually blue , with a strong gradient toward bluer central colors . recall that we have simply adopted the bulge parameters from the literature for smooth - dust models of ngc 891 .",
    "the global ( disk + bulge ) color profile rapidly reddens with increasing radius until @xmath31 disk scale - length , at a rate of roughly @xmath151 mag in @xmath149 for @xmath152 . at larger radii , all but",
    "two models then have color profiles which become monotonically bluer with increasing radius at a modest rate of @xmath153 mag , where we expect the light from the disk dominates .",
    "however , the @xmath149 color remains quite red ( @xmath154 mag ) even at large radii , while @xmath155 remains very small given the small values for the attenuation seen in figure [ fig : allfaceonsbprofs ] .",
    "a few ( @xmath35 ) profiles with dust become bluer than their dust - free counterparts at radii @xmath156 1 b band scale - length , due to scattering .",
    "since a blue bulge and red disk are not commonly found in face - on spiral galaxy samples , it is worth exploring whether these results found both from smooth and clumpy dust models are an artifact of inaccuracies of the modeling and radiative transfer or an insight into unusual properties of this extragalactic system viewed edge - on .",
    "first , as the left panel of figure [ fig : allfaceonsbprofs ] shows , both the smooth - dust model from the literature for ngc 891 s disk and our clumpy - dust models produce comparable colors ( bulge colors are the same by construction ) .",
    "hence at least the outer portion of these color profiles are not due solely to adding clumpiness and spirality to the models .    to further investigate this issue we plot the color contributions of the bulge and the disk independently for the fiducial model with zero dust in figure [ fig : smoothcolorplot ] .",
    "as we anticipated , the blue central color is entirely due to the bulge , while the disk , with a central @xmath149 color a little redder than 2.5 mag , starts dominating the color profile at @xmath157 . for a bulge as red as an early - type stellar system ( e.g. , gm spectral - type ; @xcite ) we might expect @xmath158 mag . in contrast , for a typical disk we might expect @xmath149 between 1.5 and 2 mag @xcite .",
    "however , galaxies of a given morphological type have a large scatter around any mean color values . as examples , we overlay color profiles from @xcite in figure [ fig : smoothcolorplot ] for ugc 7450 , ugc 2064 , and ugc 11628 .",
    "these are three low - inclination systems of type sabab / sabbc , not unlike the putative morphological type of ngc 891 classified from an edge - on view .",
    "images of these systems are shown in figure [ fig : counterparts ] .",
    "ugc 2064 and ugc 11628 both have red disks consistent with that of ngc 891 , at least in the inner regions .",
    "the disk of ugc 2064 , however has comparable color to that of the model for ngc 891 out to well beyond @xmath159 , while ugc 11628 has enhanced star - formation at large radii .",
    "both appear to have sufficiently strong spiral structure at larger radii to explain the asymmetry in star - formation indicators seen in ngc 891 , if these systems were viewed edge - on .",
    "in contrast to the central colors of these galaxies , ugc 7450 s central color profile is much bluer than the disk , and is consistent with the model for ngc 891 .",
    "the reason ugc 7450 s central light profile is so blue is because there exists a modest , nuclear ring of star formation , visible in figure [ fig : counterparts ] ) .",
    "while this feature is not a bulge per se , it could be mimicked by a bulge component with a strong inner gradient , as seen in the smooth model of ngc 891 .",
    "while the unusual color profile in the models are therefore _ possible _ , it is impossible to discount the ( perhaps likely ) possibility that it is due simply to the inability of optical images to probe the dust - obscured inner part of the galaxy .",
    "the attenuation of a disk galaxy is dependent on that galaxy s inclination in addition to the detailed geometry of the dust ( see @xcite for a forceful discussion of this issue ) . when computing a disk galaxy s integrated luminosity for , e.g. tf studies , this attenuation must be corrected for .",
    "multiple approaches to computing the attenuation as a function of inclination exist in the literature .",
    "@xcite constructed an attenuation correction based on theoretical formalism assuming a smooth dust slab mixed homogeneously with the stars in the slab , with a fraction of starlight above and below the slab .",
    "this model can be parameterized as @xmath160,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the fraction of light outside the slab of dust and @xmath162 is the optical depth .",
    "@xcite created an empirical formalism for the attenuation correction , parametrized by the inclination - corrected hi line - width w@xmath163 @xcite , and given by @xmath164 and @xmath165 here @xmath166 is the face - on attenuation , @xmath167 is the axis ratio , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are constants that depend on the bandpass , and q is the intrinsic axial ratio .",
    "both functions are optimized to minimize scatter in the observed tf relation .    to investigate the inclination - dependence of the attenuation on integrated magnitudes for ngc 891-like galaxies , we photometered all of our 30 best - fitting clumpy - dust models rendered at a range of inclinations , with and without dust .",
    "as before , the flux ratio between a model with and without dust allows us to compute the attenuation .",
    "we perform the same analysis for our fiducial smooth model .",
    "we plot the inclination - dependent attenuation in both hst bands in figure [ fig : inclexteffects ] .",
    "the clumpy models have statistically higher attenuation at lower inclinations than the smooth model , while at high inclinations they are comparable .",
    "this indicates that fitting smooth radiative transfer models to edge - on galaxies statistically underestimates the true amount of face - on extinction by an average of 0.1 and 0.06 mag and a maximum of 0.45 and 0.32 mag in b and i bands , respectively .",
    "we have also fit both the empirical @xcite and theoretical ( slab - model ) @xcite attenuation functions to the clumpy models .",
    "essentially this is equivalent to a calibration ( in a least - squares fitting sense ) of the functional parameters of these formalisms to our rt models .",
    "the fitting is done only for inclinations @xmath15680@xmath4 , since the theoretical function is discontinuous and the empirical function is strongly dependent on the axial ratio at purely edge - on inclinations .",
    "while both functions do a credible job of fitting the models at inclinations between 0 and 80@xmath4 , neither adequately predict the increase in attenuation at inclinations @xmath14380@xmath4 . this is not particularly worrisome for tf studies ; such high inclinations are dis - favored on the prejudicial suspicion that indeed attenuation - corrections based on these formalisms in this inclination regime are problematic .",
    "however , what is relevant for tf studies are the differences between the attenuation values used in the literature ( dotted lines in figure [ fig : inclexteffects ] ) , and the values we find using the same formalisms calibrated to our radiative transfer models of ngc 891 ( solid lines ) .",
    "it is also astrophysically interesting to note how the functional parameters change .",
    "for example , we find that in both bands the theoretical formalism based on the simple slab model used in the literature differs from that calibrated against our clumpy models almost entirely in the choice of the face - on attenuation : the fraction of light above and below the dust slab , @xmath161 , is almost unchanged between the fit to the clumpy models and that used in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the face - on attenuation is roughly doubled in the literature for both the b and i bands , from our fit value of 0.33 to 0.81 in @xcite for @xmath170 and from 0.17 to 0.28 for @xmath171 .    for the empirical formalism we also plot in figure [ fig : inclexteffects ] the attenuation function for literature parameters of @xmath168 and @xmath169 from @xcite ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 ) and a value of w@xmath163 appropriate for the observed rotation curve of ngc 891 ; and also the attenuation function calibrated to our clumpy models , fixing @xmath168 and @xmath169 at the literature values but allowing w@xmath163 to vary . for both inclination corrections",
    "we follow @xcite and convert between @xmath176 and @xmath167 using @xmath177 . for the empirical fit using literature parameters we adopt @xmath178 km s@xmath7 , twice the value for the maximum gas velocity in ngc 891 given by hyperleda @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our best calibration of this formalism requires @xmath179 km s@xmath7 and @xmath180 km s@xmath7 in the b and i bands , respectively .",
    "this value for @xmath181 is less than half of what is expected for ngc 891 based on the observed h  i gas velocity but consistent between the two bands within the uncertainties . in this formalism",
    "allowing @xmath181 to vary is equivalent to varying @xmath168 while holding @xmath181 and @xmath169 constant , and we find that for @xmath178 km s@xmath7 our clumpy models predict @xmath182 and @xmath183 , significantly lower than values from the literature .    in both cases",
    "our results imply significant revision downward for dust - corrections in tf studies . in the @xmath42 band for ngc",
    "891-like galaxies observed at @xmath184 this is equivalent to a @xmath360% decrease in the mass - to - light ratio , and intrinsic @xmath149 colors which are @xmath330% bluer .",
    "more fundamentally , our results imply that the implicit assumption in the literature , namely that the tf - scatter can be minimized as a metric for constraining other astrophysical quantities , may be incorrect in general .",
    "certainly this assumption appears to fail in the case of determining the attenuation for galaxies like ngc 891 .",
    "many estimates in the literature of star - formation rates and stellar mass density in cosmological volumes are based on counting the number of uv through near - infrared photons emitted from galaxies ( see @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "it is well known that these estimates are subject to uncertainties in the attenuation , which , as we have seen , are inclination dependent . because most star - formation appears to take place in a thin , dusty disk layer , the details of radiative transfer and the impact of a clumpy dust distribution are likely to be particularly important in predicting the emergent flux and its sed . in the context of matching optical and far - infrared and sub - millimeter observations to",
    "obtains bolometric estimates of star - formation rates , @xcite have explored the impact of embedding a thin , uv - bright disk into disk+bulge systems like the ones we have modeled here for ngc 891 .",
    "given this recent development , it is relevant to compare them to the models we have created here .    in figure",
    "[ fig : inclexteffects ] we overplot a combined disk+bulge attenuation function derived for a smooth , axisymmetric rt model of ngc 891 from @xcite ( green dashed lines ) .",
    "this model features a thin , uv - bright disk in addition to the bulge , thick disk , and dust disk components .",
    "while all the disk components are represented by smooth double - exponentials , the effects of clumpy star formation in the thin disk are approximated by artificially reserving a fraction of the input uv luminosity to be re - emitted by the dust grains .",
    "spiral arms are not included in either the dust or light components .",
    "the general form of the inclination dependence comes from @xcite , while the prescription for combining the bulge and disk attenuation into a total attenuation for ngc 891 follows the method and data given in @xcite .",
    "this model does a much better job than either the @xcite or @xcite parameterizations , and shows that the addition of a star - forming , thin disk is roughly equivalent to adding clumpy dust in spiral arms for our models with higher attenuation .",
    "this likely implies that modeling either just a thin disk _ or _ spiral arms and clumpy dust is not enough to constrain the total attenuation .",
    "we can robustly conclude that , for galaxies with dust distributions like ngc 891 , previous estimates of attenuation corrections to smooth stellar light distribution were too large . while it is tempting to infer that therefore so too were the resulting estimates for star - formation rates previously over - estimated , this inference requires a better understanding of the contribution of star - light that is not smoothly distributed .",
    "it would not be surprising that in order to truly determine the attenuation of spiral disks both the detailed structure of star - forming regions and spirality must be considered simultaneously .",
    "in section 5.2 we considered the values of the attenuation curve parameter r@xmath185 at several different radii . here , we consider the value that applies for the integrated light of a galaxy as a function of inclination . using the same definition of the attenuation curve parameter r@xmath185 as before , in figure [ fig : rbiplot ] we plot r@xmath185 histograms for our 30 best fitting models at the four inclinations of figure [ fig : inclexteffects ] .",
    "we also include the values for r@xmath185 of the smooth model as well as literature values for a foreground screen @xcite and star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "we first note the dependence of r@xmath185 with inclination , with the peak of the r@xmath185 histogram increasing by @xmath30.75 between i=0@xmath1 and 80@xmath4 .",
    "this dependence is due to a combination of scattering and projection effects , as well as the saturation of the color excess @xmath186 at higher values of @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "the smooth model shows this trend as well , although it has a slightly lower r@xmath185 value at all non - edge - on inclinations .        at edge - on inclination r@xmath185 is much more variable between our models .",
    "this is due mainly to geometrical projection effects ( from having large amounts of relatively unattenuated flux above and below the midplane ) which cause the color excess to become very small for some ( @xmath35 ) models . for these models",
    "r@xmath185 becomes very large . rather than dilute the meaning of the figure we choose not to plot these models .",
    "even excluding the models with the largest values of r@xmath185 , there is a much larger dispersion in the attenuation curve parameter at edge - on inclination , with a general preference toward larger values of r@xmath185 .",
    "this is true even for the smooth model , which at lower inclinations has a lower - than - average r@xmath185 but at 90@xmath4 has a grayer attenuation curve than most of the non - axisymmetric models .",
    "the peak of the r@xmath185 histogram occurs at larger values than the foreground screen at all inclinations , from a difference of @xmath30.25 at face - on inclinations to @xmath31 at 80@xmath4 .",
    "this means that for a given attenuation the internal reddening is grayer ( i.e. less wavelength - dependent ) than expected for a simple screen .",
    "we find good agreement between the @xcite attenuation model and our simulations at face - on inclinations , but at larger inclinations our rt models have systematically larger values of r@xmath185 .",
    "this difference is likely due to selection effects in the empirical estimates , both because there are more galaxies with inclinations @xmath188 than there are with i @xmath189 , and the @xcite sample is selected based partly on high uv emission which is most likely to be from galaxies at or near face - on orientation . at edge - on inclinations",
    "the attenuation curve has a low dependence on color , but the grayness of the curve is highly model - dependent .",
    "we have optimized a 3d monte carlo scattered light rt model to hst f450w and f814w images ( essentially b and i band ) of ngc 891 . our model is the first rt model involving realistic dust clumping and spirality to be quantitatively fit to imaging data .",
    "dust is treated using a fractal algorithm , while spirality is included using a logarithmic spiral parameterization with a coarsely adjustable arm - interarm width ratio .    in order to enhance the effects of non - axisymmetric dust we constructed @xmath27 maps using smooth models from the literature , then used the coefficients of a high - order shapelet image reconstruction to compare our clumpy models with the data .",
    "computing monte carlo models at a high resolution is computationally expensive , so we used a genetic algorithm to find good solutions in our many - dimensional parameter space in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the efficiency of the genetic algorithm also allowed us to include a wide range of parameter values in order to fully probe our parameter space .",
    "we computed @xmath190-generation runs of the genetic algorithm and find a fairly wide variety of parameter values in the best - fitting models .",
    "some of this variety is likely due to complex interdependencies of the free parameters , ( e.g. central disk surface brightness , scale length , and scale height for dust and stars ) , while the rest is the result of degeneracies from choosing such a large parameter space .    despite these degeneracies ,",
    "the best - fitting models from our 30 genetic algorithm runs do a credible job at mimicking the general features of the edge on profile of ngc 891 .",
    "perhaps more importantly , our models appear to be realistic simulations of _ face - on _ galaxies as well . while some of this is due to our more advanced treatment of spirality , which automatically creates more realistic - looking spiral features than previous work , it is important to note that the amount of spirality and clumping were free parameters ; in 29 out of 30 runs our algorithm chose minima with clear spirality ( despite not constraining the direction of the spiral structure ) and the median fraction of dust placed in clumps is 58% .",
    "this is the first quantitative measurement of the clumpiness of dust in edge - on spiral galaxies that is not dependent on empirically matching ir seds but rather on observable dust morphology , and is in general agreement with clumpy fractions obtained through the sed fitting method .",
    "the preference for visible spiral features and clumpy dust has significant implications for the face - on attenuation in spiral galaxies .",
    "we find that while overall our models prefer low ( a@xmath191 and @xmath192 ) face - on attenuation , clumping and spirality produce localized regions of enhanced dust absorption , creating type ii surface brightness profiles as well as very small ( @xmath193 ) high attenuation filling factors .",
    "these clumps result in larger total attenuation than a smooth model at low inclinations while having comparable attenuation when viewed edge - on , where the clumps overlap to more closely mimic a smooth dust distribution .",
    "additionally , we probed the effect of the dust when viewed as a foreground screen on background light sources . while still highly concentrated in spiral arms , we find significantly higher optical depths than would be suspected when only considering the attenuation  on average 1.2 mag larger in the b band and 0.5 mag larger in the i band at one scale - length . the discrepancy between the optical depths and the attenuation comes from both the admixture of dust and starlight as well as the effect of scattering .",
    "the optical depths of our models are broadly in agreement with some measurements from the literature but not others , which may be a result of a large range in the optical depths in real galaxies .",
    "we find that our models predict a blue bulge and red disk for ngc 891 when viewed face - on , regardless of the attenuation .",
    "the smooth , axisymmetric fiducial model from the literature which we use to construct our @xmath39 maps also has this unusual morphology , and while we use bulge parameters from the the literature the red disk is present in our models even though we allowed the central disk emissivities and scale - lengths and heights to vary . while perhaps not common , an inspection of surface brightness profiles of a sample of face - on galaxies shows that blue , star - forming cores and red disks do exist in intermediate - type spirals .",
    "however , we observe neither of these features in the milky way , despite the frequently claimed similarity between ngc 891 and our own galaxy .    even with the increased face - on attenuation in the clumpy models relative to smooth dust models , virtually all of our simulations have smaller attenuations at all inclinations than would be expected given corrections based on simple radiative transfer models and empirical formulae in common use in the literature .",
    "this result indicates that tf studies need reduced attenuation corrections by typically 0.5 mag in b band at i=60@xmath1 , and 0.25 mag in i at the same inclination .",
    "inclination corrections based on more advanced rt models of edge - on spiral galaxies , however , do fit some of our dustier simulations very well and point to the need to include star - forming regions as well as spirality in future efforts .",
    "our models also predict a significantly grayer attenuation curve than found for both a simple foreground screen of dust and an attenuation curve derived from uv - bright star forming galaxies .",
    "we also find that the attenuation curve becomes @xmath340% grayer with inclination , something not considered in currently favored attenuation models .",
    "both the large amount of edge - on variability of the models and the gradual systematic increase in r@xmath185 with inclination are a strong caution for extrapolating empirically determined attenuation curves to objects with high inclinations .",
    "we have not been able to produce clumpy dust models with the realistic high - latitude dust `` chimneys '' seen in the data , although it is unlikely including them would significantly change our results due to their low spatial frequency and small size .",
    "it is unclear whether the lack of high - latitude dust in our models is due to a poor choice of fitness function or the fractal geometry , although the fractal algorithm is certainly not optimized to produce extended dust `` fingers '' .",
    "we find that the shapelet coefficients of the data have fewer extreme ( large or small ) coefficient values as well as a better balance of power between odd and even coefficients than most of the clumpy models ; these observations will help us to improve our fitness metric .",
    "finding a method for computing model fitnesses more sensitive to small - scale structures would help improve the reproduction of dust substructure regardless of the clumping formalism .",
    "multi - stage fitting processes may be useful to reduce the size of parameter space ; global parameters ( like central brightness , scale - length , and spirality ) could be determined from smooth , lower resolution models covering the whole galaxy then fed into a much higher resolution model where the only free parameters relate to the dust density and clumping .",
    "in producing quantitative rt modeling which includes spirality and clumping we have made the first foray into a new generation of highly detailed simulations that produce images capable of resembling real galaxy morphologies at any inclination . extending clumpy , non - axisymmetric models based on our prototype to larger fields of view and large wavelength baselines",
    ", we expect to be able to constrain the 3d structure of spiral disks using physically realistic simulations as well as more accurately predict thermal dust re - emission in the mid - infrared . additionally , the increase in resolution of far - ir images provided by the _ herschel space observatory _ will enable the next generation of sed models to fit seds to multiple positions of individual galaxies , where the signatures of non - axisymmetric structures will be more difficult to average out . by creating a realistic form of spiral structure and dust clumping we provide a blueprint for future work in this area .",

    "<S> we produce three - dimensional monte - carlo radiative transfer models of the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 891 , a fast - rotating galaxy thought to be an analogue to the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the models contain realistic spiral arms and a fractal distribution of clumpy dust . </S>",
    "<S> we fit our models to _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> images corresponding to the b and i bands , using shapelet analysis and a genetic algorithm to generate 30 statistically best - fitting models . </S>",
    "<S> these models have a strong preference for spirality and clumpiness , with average face - on attenuation decreasing from 0.24(0.16 ) to 0.03(0.03 ) mag in the b(i ) band between 0.5 and 2 radial scale - lengths . </S>",
    "<S> most of the attenuation comes from small high - density clumps with low ( @xmath010% ) filling factors . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of dust in clumps is broadly consistent with results from fitting ngc 891 s spectral energy distribution . because of </S>",
    "<S> scattering effects and the intermixed nature of the dust and starlight , attenuation is smaller and less wavelength - dependent than the integrated dust column - density . </S>",
    "<S> our clumpy models typically have higher attenuation at low inclinations than previous radiative transfer models using smooth distributions of stars and dust , but similar attenuation at inclinations above 70@xmath1 . at all inclinations </S>",
    "<S> most clumpy models have less attenuation than expected from previous estimates based on minimizing scatter in the tully - fisher relation . </S>",
    "<S> mass - to - light ratios are higher and the intrinsic scatter in the tully - fisher relation is larger than previously expected for galaxies similar to ngc 891 . </S>",
    "<S> the attenuation curve changes as a function of inclination , with @xmath2 increasing by @xmath30.75 from face - on to near - edge - on orientations . </S>"
