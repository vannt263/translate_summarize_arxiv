    "cp violation , initially observed  @xcite only in the @xmath7@xmath8 system , is one feature of the standard model ( sm ) that still defies clear theoretical understanding . the ckm picture , which describes _ all _ the _ observed _ cp violation in terms of a single phase in the quark - mixing matrix , has been vindicated by the recent measurements of @xmath9@xmath10 mixing at belle and babar  @xcite .",
    "cp violation is in fact one of the necessary ingredients for generating the observed excess of baryons over antibaryons in the universe @xcite .",
    "the amount of cp violation present in the quark sector is , however , too small to generate a baryon asymmetry of the observed level of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "new sources of cp violation _ beyond _ the sm are therefore a necessity  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is arguably the most attractive extension of the sm , as it solves , for instance , the problem of the instability of the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale against radiative corrections .",
    "already the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite provides possible new sources of cp violation through additional cp - violating phases , which can not be rotated away by simple field redefinitions",
    ". a large number of these phases , particularly those involving sparticles of the first and to a large extent of the second generation , are severely constrained by measurements of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , muon , neutron as well as @xmath12hg and @xmath13tl",
    ". however , these constraints are model - dependent .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that cancellations among different diagrams allow certain combinations of these phases to be large in a general mssm .",
    "furthermore , if the sfermions of the first two generations are sufficiently heavy , above the 1 tev range , the edm constraints on the phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath14 , in general constrained to @xmath15 , get weaker ; the sfermions of the third generation can still be light . non - vanishing phases of @xmath16 and/or the trilinear scalar couplings @xmath17 can induce explicit cp violation in the higgs sector via loop corrections @xcite .",
    "though these phases generate edms independently of the first two generations of sfermions , the edms are suppressed by the mass scale of the two heavy higgses @xcite . for a thorough discussion of the edms see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the above mentioned phases can also have a significant influence on the higgs production rates in the gluon fusion mode at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite .",
    "mssm cp phases can hence change the higgs phenomenology at colliders quite substantially .",
    "all this makes the mssm with cp - violating phases a very attractive proposition .",
    "it has therefore been the subject of many recent investigations , studying the implications of these phases on neutralino / chargino production and decay @xcite , on the third generation of sfermions @xcite , as well as the neutral @xcite and charged @xcite higgs sector .",
    "various cp - even and cp - odd ( t - odd ) observables , which can give information on these phases , have been identified .",
    "it is interesting to note that cp - even observables such as masses , branching ratios , cross sections , etc .",
    ", often afford more precise probes thanks to the larger magnitude of the effects . for direct evidence of cp violation , however , cp - odd / t - odd observables as discussed e.g.  in @xcite have to be measured .",
    "the latest study of the @xmath18 sector in @xcite demonstrates that it may be possible to determine the real and imaginary parts of @xmath19 to a precision of 23% from a fit of the mssm lagrange parameters to masses , cross sections and branching ratios at a future @xmath20 linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "this requires that both the @xmath21 , @xmath22 mass eigenstates can be produced at the lc and the branching ratios measured with high precision . in the @xmath23 sector @xcite the precision on @xmath24 is worse , around 1020% for low @xmath25 and about 37% for large @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the longitudinal polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays , i.e.  @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 a third generation ( s)quark or ( s)lepton , can also be used as a probe of cp phases",
    ". the fermion polarization can give complementary information to the decay branching ratios and will in particular be useful if the branching ratios can not be measured with high enough precision or if one decay channel dominates .",
    "the average polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays carries information on the @xmath29@xmath30 mixing as well as on the gaugino  higgsino mixing @xcite .",
    "the polarizations that can be measured are those of top and tau ; both can be inferred from the decay lepton distributions .",
    "it is its large mass that causes the @xmath31 to decay before hadronization and thus the decay products can carry information about its polarization .",
    "for taus , also the energy distribution of the decay pions can be used .",
    "the polarization of the decay fermions has been used for studies of mssm parameter determination in the cp - conserving case in @xcite . for the cp - violating case",
    ", the phase dependence of the longitudinal fermion polarization has been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we extend these studies by discussing in detail the sensitivity of the fermion polarization to cp - violating phases in the mssm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we summarize our notation for the description of the sfermion , neutralino and chargino systems in the mssm with cp violation . in section  3 , we discuss fermion polarization in sfermion decays to neutralinos , @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "we present numerical results on the polarization as a function of different mssm parameters and discuss the sensitivity to cp - violating phases in the sfermion and neutralino sectors . in section",
    "4 we perform an analogous analysis for @xmath34 decays . in section  5",
    "we summarize the results and present our conclusions .",

    "the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath58 by convention , we choose @xmath52 to be the lighter mass eigenstate , @xmath59 .",
    "notice also that @xmath60 . for the mixing angle @xmath55 we choose @xmath61 which places @xmath55 in the 2nd quadrant of the unit circle .",

    "moreover , we see that the phase dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath49 is determined by @xmath70 .",
    "this dependence is strongest if @xmath71 .",
    "this issue will be discussed in more detail in the numerical analyses of sections  3 and 4 .      in the basis @xmath72 the neutralino mass matrix is : @xmath73    the gaugino mass parameters @xmath74 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath16 can in principle all be complex .",

    ", @xmath280 @xmath281 can be resolved if @xmath260 is ( not ) known precisely , quite independently of @xmath199 .",
    "observing such a @xmath282 also implies a bound on @xmath283 of @xmath284 @xmath285  gev .",
    "if the precision on @xmath75 and @xmath119 is 0.1% and @xmath164 , we get @xmath286 at @xmath272 , so that the error is dominated by the experimental uncertainty .",
    "however , the resultant improvement in the sensitivity is limited to @xmath287 and @xmath288  gev .",
    "b shows @xmath237 as a function of @xmath246 , for @xmath262  gev , @xmath289  gev , and the other parameters as above ( @xmath174  gev at @xmath131 ) .",
    "the effect of an uncertainty in @xmath260 is again shown as grey bands for @xmath131 and @xmath265 . estimating the parametric uncertainty in the same way as above , but with @xmath290  gev",
    ", we get @xmath291 at @xmath272 . varying in addition @xmath2734.5",
    "gev gives @xmath292 . adding a 10% measurement error on @xmath237 in quadrature",
    ", we end up with @xmath293 ( @xmath294 ) without ( with ) the effect of @xmath259 , shown as error bars in b. in a three - dimensional plot , @xmath237 has a bell - like shape in the @xmath128@xmath246 plane , with contours of constant @xmath237 being ellipses in this plane .",
    "if @xmath199 is not known , a measurement of @xmath237 may therefore be useful to put limits on @xmath128 and @xmath246 , but not on @xmath282 , which restricts @xmath283 . in our case study , we have assumed that @xmath295 is known . in this case , a measurement of @xmath296 , for instance , would restrict @xmath297 at @xmath298 , while a measurement of @xmath299 would disfavour @xmath300 as well as @xmath301 .",
    "the latter would also allow a constraint on @xmath282 .",
    "as mentioned above , a lower limit on @xmath282 implies a lower limit on @xmath283 . an upper limit on @xmath302",
    "can be used to set an upper limit on @xmath283 as a function of @xmath303 : @xmath304 .",
    "note , however , that this becomes unbounded for @xmath305 .",
    "we have also investigated the case of large @xmath25 ( @xmath306 ) .",
    "it reveals a @xmath246 dependence similar to that of a , with almost no dependence on @xmath199 and the @xmath307 dependence accordingly more pronounced .",
    "we encounter , however , a large parametric uncertainty , which practically washes out the sensitivity to @xmath302 . + _ to sum up , _ tau polarization in @xmath219 decays depends only little on @xmath199 .",
    "@xmath220 is hence not a promising quantity to study cp phases , but may be useful for ( consistency ) tests of the gaugino  higgsino mixing .",
    "top polarization in @xmath218 decays , on the other hand , can be useful to probe @xmath199 , @xmath246 and/or @xmath308 in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "the measurement of @xmath237 , revealing phases or being consistent with vanishing phases , may also constrain @xmath283 .",
    "we have discussed the influence of cp - violating phases on the fermion polarization in sfermion decays to neutralinos or charginos , @xmath309 and @xmath310 ( @xmath206 ; @xmath82 ; @xmath311 ) .",
    "this polarization is considered as a useful tool for the mssm parameter determination @xcite .    in decays into charginos ,",
    "the polarization depends on the phase of @xmath16 .",
    "since this dependence is weak in the case of @xmath219 , @xmath220 does not provide a promising probe of cp phases ( on the other hand , exactly this feature can make @xmath220 useful for consistency tests of gaugino  higgsino mixing )",
    ". in @xmath312 decays , the dependence on @xmath199 can be rather large ; in addition , also the phase of the sbottom - mixing matrix plays a role . if @xmath313 , @xmath314 .",
    "we found that this case can be difficult to distinguish from the cp - conserving case by measuring @xmath315 . if , however , a deviation from @xmath316 is observed , these phases can be constrained and also limits on @xmath245 can be derived .",
    "the decays @xmath317 and @xmath318 provide a more effective probe of cp violation because an additional phase , the phase of @xmath77 , contributes .",
    "we found that cp phases can have a significant effect on the top and tau polarizations , especially if the involved neutralino has a sizeable higgsino component .",
    "if the parameters of the neutralino sector can be measured precisely , e.g.  in @xmath20 annihilation with polarized beams , @xmath319 and @xmath320 can be useful for the determination of cp phases .",
    "in particular , since @xmath192 unless @xmath119 is very large , a measurement of @xmath144 can give information on @xmath19 .",
    "in this respect it is important to note that ( for fixed masses ) the sfermion production cross sections do not depend on cp phases . in the sfermion sector",
    ", these can be manifest in branching ratios as discussed in @xcite , polarization of the decay fermions as discussed in this paper , and cp - odd asymmetries .",
    "branching ratios are in general rather difficult to measure with high precision .",
    "the information that can be gained from branching ratios is also limited if one decay channel dominates , e.g. @xmath136 in case of a light stau .",
    "this makes the polarization of the decay fermions a very interesting possibility to explore cp phases .",
    "last but not least we note that the computations in this paper , leading to effects of a few percent , have been performed at tree level",
    ". the influence of radiative corrections @xcite can be of comparable size and will therefore have to be taken into account for precision analyses .",
    "a measurement of the cp phases in the sfermion/@xmath321 sector will also complement cp studies of the higgs sector @xcite , since in the mssm higgs - sector cp violation is generated through quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "last but not least we emphazise that , since the effects can be large , the possibility of cp violation should be taken into account in precision susy parameter analyses , especially in a general analysis project as envisaged in @xcite .",
