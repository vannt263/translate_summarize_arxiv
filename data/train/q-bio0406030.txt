    "the idea of obtaining the interaction energy between pairs of amino acids , in the form of a contact potential , from the statistical analysis of known proteins has been developed in detailed by miyazawa and jernigan in 1985 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the contact formation can be regarded as a chemical reaction , they make use of boltzmann statistics to relate the frequencies of occurence of a given pair of amino acids in proteins to the associated contact energy ( this is the so  called \" quasi  chemical approximation ) . this idea has been further developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since then , this method has undergone wide criticism , both from the point of view of its soundness and of its implementation .",
    "finkelstein and coworkers challenged the validity of the basic assumption of the method @xcite .",
    "they highlighted the fact that boltzmann statistics arises as a consequence of transitions between states of a physical system , while pairs of amino acids are not free to move in the data set of proteins used to obtain the distribution of contacts between pairs of amino acids .",
    "in other words , different contacts are not excitations of the same system .",
    "nevertheless , they suggest that contact probabilities still follow a boltzmann distribution , but for a different reason . assuming that protein sequences are random",
    ", their contacts will be also random , and a boltzmann  like distribution of pair contacts arises as the ratio between the gaussian distributions associated with random energies . in this respect , finkelstein and",
    "coworkers interpret the temperature which characterizes this boltzmann  like distribution as the freezing temperature of the random energy model in conformational space ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ben ",
    "naim has questioned whether the energy derived with statistical arguments corresponds to any physical process @xcite .",
    "thomas and dill have emphasized the fact that , to derive a boltzmann distribution , one assumes that each pair of amino acids is independent of all other pairs @xcite , an assumption which is not valid because of the high density of amino acids in proteins .",
    "moreover , they noted a possible problem in the fact that frequencies of occurence are obtained counting pairs of amino acids both in the same protein and in different proteins .",
    "they also show that the temperature and the reference state ( the zero  energy state ) are ill  defined ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is our opinion that the analysis of amino acid pair distributions can be simplified if considered in an evolutionary context .",
    "in fact , evolution is the very dynamical process which controls which amino acids are in contact in the native conformations of proteins .",
    "the elementary moves of such dynamics are mutations , deletions and insertions , and take place on the timescale of millions of years .",
    "the misconception at the basis of the `` quasi  chemical approximation '' is the idea that the dynamical process which controls which amino acids are in contact is the conformational change which opens or closes a contact , on the timescale of picoseconds .",
    "this dynamics is indeed present , and controls the stability of a contact ( i.e. the probability that it is open rather than closed ) , but can not be directly responsible for the likelihood of the amino acids which build the contact .",
    "in fact , the contact probabilities used to derive the contact energies are those calculated in the native state ( i.e. crystallographic or nmr structures ) which are , by virtue of anfinsen s paradigm @xcite , uniquely determined by the protein sequence .",
    "consequently , the energy barrier which a protein must overcome to change a contact with another one is that associated with a change in the sequence ( i.e. , @xmath0kt , involving the whole replication machinery of the cell ) , the associated time scale being much longer than that of protein conformational changes ( which take place at @xmath1 ) .    from this view point",
    ", we can obtain information on the contact frequencies by analyzing the dynamics in the space of sequences at fixed conformation , rather than that in the space of conformations at fixed sequence .",
    "if one assumes that evolution has reached an equilibrium state , then the contact frequencies observed in proteins can be identified with the equilibrium distribution of contacts associated with the underlying evolutionary dynamics . whether we can assume that the dataset of known protein sequences represent thermodynamical equilibrium is a difficult issue . a suggestion that this is the case has been made by rost in ref .",
    "@xcite , noting that the distribution of sequence similarities for all known proteins is approximately gaussian , centered around the random value @xmath2 .",
    "note that , however , this suggestion has been questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to be quantitative",
    ", one has to specify a model for evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the simplest model pictures an evolutionary step as a random mutation followed by a check on the ability the new sequence has to fold ( i.e. , if the mutated protein can still fold to a unique native conformation the move is accepted , otherwise the new sequence is discarded ) .",
    "moreover , one can add an evolutionary bias toward low  energy proteins , assuming that more stable proteins are selected with higher probability ( see below ) . in other words ,",
    "the protein dataset is produced by subsequent mutations from a `` parent '' folding sequence .",
    "the selection rule , that is checking whether the mutated protein can fold , requires , in principle , a lengthy exploration of conformational space ( e.g. , by molecular dynamics ) .",
    "fortunately , the selection rule can be further simplified .",
    "in fact , study of minimal models have shown that the folding ability of a protein sequence is mainly determined by its native state energy @xcite . approximating the energy distribution of unfolded conformations by mean of the random energy model @xcite ( i.e. , assuming that the contact energies in unfolded conformations are independent stochastic variables ) , it is possible to conclude that if a sequence displays in its conformational ground state an energy lower than a threshold @xmath3 , determined by its length and by statistical properties ( average and standard deviation ) of the interaction potential ( thus , independent of the detailed sequence ) , then it is likely to fold to a unique native state ( for a model study , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , the lower is the energy , the more stable is the native state .",
    "a consequence of these findings is that each point of sequence space can be labeled with a single quantity , namely the conformational ground state energy of the associated sequence , instead that with a whole conformational energy spectrum ( that , in principle , would be necessary to assess the folding properties of a sequences ) .",
    "evolution is then associated with energy fluctuations ( i.e. , exchange of energy between the protein and an ideal external reservoir ) , with the constraint that the native energy of a protein can never overcome the threshold @xmath3 . in accordance with classical thermodynamics",
    ", one can define a temperature @xmath4 which control the equilibrium average native energy and the fluctuations about the average @xcite .",
    "this temperature , which is not related in any way to the conformational temperature of the protein , has the meaning of an evolutionary pressure toward low  energy proteins .",
    "one has now to make three caveats concerning the model of evolution discussed above .",
    "first , it takes only into account the folding properties of a protein , but not other important features such as functional requirements , binding sites , etc .",
    "second , only point mutations are allowed implying , among other things , that neither the length of the protein nor the threshold energy @xmath3 change .",
    "such a generalization of the problem can easily be accounted for , although in the following we will consider , for sake of clearness , only chains of fixed length . ] .",
    "third , it is important that the concentrations of different kinds of amino acids are constrained , otherwise at low values of @xmath4 the system would display only those amino acids with the lowest interaction energy elements , and the chain would look more like a homopolymer ( or oligopolymer ) than like a protein .",
    "this would not only be unrealistic , since proteins typically display comparable concentration of the different types of amino acids ( at least in terms of orders of magnitude ) , but also would challenge the folding ability of the protein , since the value of @xmath3 depends on the average and standard deviation of the interaction matrix , weighted on the concentration of the amino acids .",
    "if such concentrations can vary , the value of @xmath3 can not be considered sequence  independent and the evolutionary algorithm described above fails . in the worst scenario ( i.e. , very low @xmath4 with the miyazawa ",
    "jernigan interaction matrix ) , the evolutionary algorithm would produce mostly homopolymers composed of cysteine . to avoid this problem ,",
    "we will fix ( in sect .",
    "[ css ] ) the concentration of different kinds of amino acids to their average values ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in what follows we work out the distribution probability of amino acid contacts . using the standard derivation for closed systems ( see ,",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can obtain the boltzmann distribution @xmath5/z$ ] for the probability of occurence of a sequence @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the associated native energy ( with @xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore , one can consider each contact of the protein as a subsystem which , on the evolutionary timescale , can exchange energy ( by mutations ) with the rest of the protein , pictured as a heat bath .",
    "making use of the basic approximation that each contact is not correlated to the others , the probability of observing a contact between amino acids of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 at equilibrium is @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the interaction energy and @xmath13 is a temperature  like parameter which controls the average energy of the contact . at equilibrium ,",
    "the temperature of the system is equal throughout , and one can set @xmath14 .    to be noted that the evolutionary boltzmann statistics describing the distribution of contacts is different from the `` quasi  chemical approximation '' , because it takes place in the space of sequences and not in that of conformations .",
    "it is also different from that derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , because it does not assume a protein database populated of random sequences . in particular , the temperature which controls",
    "the distribution is not a conformational temperature , but an evolutionary temperature .    the assumptions made to obtain eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) are that the system is at equilibrium , that the contacts which build out a protein are uncorrelated and that the concentration of different types of amino acids can vary at will . while the equilibrium condition displays some soundness @xcite , the others are quite crude . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss corrections to eq .",

    "( [ boltzmann ] ) and to develop possible extensions , we follow the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , where one choses an interaction matrix @xmath15 for model proteins , create a dataset of folding sequences according to this interaction matrix , derive from the sequence dataset the pair frequencies , and from these try to obtain the interaction energies by mean of relationships of the type given in eq .",

    "@xcite ( table 6 , which we shall call mj , and table 5 , which we shall call mj2 ) , and the other one is a symmetric matrix generated extracting its elements at random from a gaussian distribution .",
    "all of them have been shifted and rescaled to display zero mean and standard deviation @xmath16 ( in units of @xmath17 ) .",
    "a particular feature of the matrix mj2 is that it displays correlations between its elements , in such a way that can be well approximated by the two lowest eigenvalue terms in a eigenvalue decomposition @xcite ( naively speaking , most negative terms are concentrated toward one corner of the matrix and the most positive toward the opposite corner ) .",
    "the matrix mj has been obtained by the matrix mj2 subtracting the effects of the solvent and does not display any feature which makes it distinguishable from a random matrix .",
    "the results obtained with the mj matrix are substantially identical to those obtained with the random matrix .",
    "the dataset of sequences has been created fixing one ( or more ) compact structures and generating sequences with a monte carlo algorithm at temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the pair frequencies @xmath19 are then calculated counting the relative occurence of the contact between amino acids of kind @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the whole dataset .",

    "( [ boltzmann ] ) , for different choices of the evolutionary temperature .",
    "an important parameter to quantify the validity of the energy prediction methods is the root mean square deviation ( rmsd , i.e. the root of the reduced @xmath21 ) associated with a linear fit of the predicted energies as a function of the `` true '' energies , which accounts for the typical variation of the predicted energies from the true ones .",

    "[ fig_mj2](a ) ) , although reasonably correlated , display an effective temperature which is approximately the half of the evolutionary temperature at which the sequences have been selected .",

    "the different behavior with respect to the random interaction matrix arises because here some amino acids are intrinsically more attractive than others , due to the order in the interaction matrix .",
    "consequently , at low evolutionary temperatures , these attractive amino acids appear more often than the others .",
    "this does not happen in the case of the random matrix , where each amino acid interacts , in average , like any other .",
    "in other words , different amino acids display different chemical potentials in the case of the mj2 matrix , while display the same chemical potential in the case of the random matrix .",
    "the rmsd related to the boltzmann approximation , listed in table 2 , are calculated using the effective temperature , which corresponds to a rescaling of the actual temperature by a factor indicated in the fourth column of table 2 ( i.e. , the slope of the linear fit of the function @xmath48 ) .",
    "while the features associated with the whole set of data are not very meaningful , being affected by the lack of statistics discussed above , the features associated with the range @xmath49 indicate a performance of the prediction methods comparable with that of the random matrix . note that , for all purposes , the detailed knowledge of the attractive energies is much more critical that the knowledge of the repulsive .",

    "( [ p2 ] ) gives better results in both cases .",
    "the behavior of the mj matrix is identical to that of the random matrix ( data not shown ) .",
    "note that the accounting for correlations described in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) can be easily integrated in any algorithm which derives potentials from pair statistics ( e.g. , ref .",
    "algorithms which optimize simultaneously the parameters which define the potentials , on the other hand , accounts implicitly for correlations between amino acids in the process of energy optimization .",
    "nonetheless , the explicit treatment of such correlations seems to be fruitful . in the case of the algorithm employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the correlation coefficient between true and predicted energies is 0.84 , while that associated with our method is , in the worst case , 0.88 ( see caption to fig .",
    "[ fig_mj2 ] ) .",
    "looking at the sequences generated at low evolutionary temperatures which produce the data analyzed in the previous section , one notes an unrealistic feature , namely that at low @xmath4 the frequencies of the different kinds of amino acids are extremely uneven , some of the proteins displaying only a limited subset of all amino acids . consequently , when working at high evolutionary pressure , could be desirable to constrain the relative concentrations of amino acids .",
    "of course , in performing this kind of approach , one gives up to obtain the concentration of amino acids as an emergent feature of the system and sets it by hand .",
    "the reason why we follow this strategy is that the concentrations of amino acids observed in real proteins are the result of a balance between different factors : not only the thermodynamical requirement of displaying a native energy well below @xmath3 , but also the need not to display too many hydrophobic residues to prevent aggregation , to have enough amino acids of a given kind to perform some biological task , etc .",
    "the model we employ is too simple to account for all these effects , and accordingly we do not attempt to obtain the concentrations from the model , but we fix it _",
    "a priori_.    thus , we have repeated the above calculations using the mj2 matrix and adding the constrain that the concentration of each amino acid is constant and equal to each other ( this is a simplification , since different amino acids occur with different probabilities in real proteins @xcite .",
    "the generalization is straightforward ) .",
    "this constrain introduces nonlocal correlations in the sequence , since the occurence probability of a pair of amino acids now depends on the presence of other amino acids of the same kind everywhere else .    in order to keep into account these constrains ,",

    "this problem becomes more serious in the case of real proteins , where the continuous character of the degrees of freedom makes the coordination number of residues more variable than in the case of lattice models .",
    "however , one could expect that this is partially compensated by the fact that real proteins are typically longer than the lattice chains we have employed , and consequently the ratio of bulk / surface residues is larger ( at least , for globular proteins ) . in the case of the set of proteins used by miyazawa and jernigan @xcite , the mean coordination number is @xmath66 and the standard deviation is @xmath67 . to reduce the standard deviation one can , following ref .",

    "we have shown that , looking at the set of proteins from an evolutionary point of view , it is possible to obtain contact energies between amino acids in a sound way , making use of standard thermodynamics ( although used in the context of finite systems ) .",
    "this approach also allows to understand which are the limitations in the approximations of the method , as , for example , the presence of correlations between amino acids , and to develop corrections to those approximations .    for sequences generated without any constrain on their composition , accounting for correlations allows to decrease the rmsd from 20.2 to 5.1 in the case of the mj matrix and from 8.3 to 2.2 in the case of the negative elements of the mj2 matrix ( the correlation coefficients increasing from 0.86 to 0.99 and from 0.98 to 0.99 , respectively ) .",

    "this is a key issue when one wants to use these potentials to determine , for example , binding constants , but it is less critical in folding studies .",
    "anyway , the determination of this parameter is something which can not be done from the contact probabilities alone , but requires further ingredients , and consequently goes beyond the purpose of the present work .",
    "it is interesting to repeat the calculations performed by miyazawa and jernigan , deriving the frequencies of occurence of amino acid pairs in the same database of real proteins used by them @xcite . comparing the energies obtained making use of the boltzmann ",
    "statistics approach ( i.e. , eq . ( [ boltzmann ] ) , in the spirit of the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite with the corrections discussed above , we obtain energies which are substantially different from theirs . taking care of the spatial correlations ( eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) ) , we obtain a set of energies whose correlation parameter with the miyazawa ",
    "jernigan set is 0.91 and whose rmsd is @xmath76 . in keeping into account also the correlations due to amino acids conservation ( eq .",
    "( [ cons1 ] ) ) the correlation coefficient becomes 0.96 and the rmsd @xmath77 .",
    "if one assumes that a protein is a closed system , the equilibrium probability for a sequence @xmath78 is given by @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a contact function which contains the information about the coordinates @xmath81 of the ( fixed ) native conformation .",
    "since we are interested in the probability of a single contact ( say , between @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) , we can make the interaction @xmath84 explicit , as @xmath85.\\ ] ] focusing our attention on the nearest neighbors ( e.g. , @xmath86 ) of the @xmath24th and @xmath87th contacts , we obtain @xmath88+ ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be shortened as @xmath89 where @xmath90 $ ] is proportional to the probability that the @xmath86th site of the protein is occupied by amino acid @xmath91 due to the effect of all other residues of the protein except that in the @xmath24th site .",
    "the existence of an effective temperature arises from the the correlations present in the mj2 correlation matrix . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider the example of an interaction matrix which emphasizes the hydrophobic character of the amino acids , in the form @xmath94 , then eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) becomes @xmath95\\left(\\sum_\\gamma e^{-x(\\gamma)/t_{evol}}\\right)^{2(\\gamma-1)},\\ ] ] which approximates a boltzmann distribution with an effective temperature @xmath96 smaller than the real temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this is the simplest kind of correlation which could affect the system .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the interaction matrix mj2 has the form @xmath97 , corresponding to considering only the first two terms in the eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix .",
    "this , or more complicated , kinds of correlation can not be accounted for analytically , but are likely to be responsible for the appearance of an effective temperature .",
