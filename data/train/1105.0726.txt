    "at the 25th anniversary of the discovery of high temperature superconductivity ( bednorz and mller 1986 ) we still lack a complete understanding of this astonishing phenomenon . however , we can take a look back at the history of low temperature superconductivity to get some perspective on this apparent lack of progress .",
    "the original formulation of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory ( bardeen 1957a,1957b ) treated the interaction between a pair of electrons with up and down spin of equal and opposite momentum at the fermi energy by a constant average matrix element .",
    "while it was clear from the isotope effect on the transition temperature @xmath1 that phonons were involved , it took high resolution tunnelling experiments by mcmillan and rowell ( 1965 ) to accurately resolve the underlying bosonic structure of the electron - phonon spectral density denoted by @xmath0 and relate it to the phonon spectrum as determined by inelastic neutron scattering ( brockhouse 1962 ) .",
    "a further important step was to calculate this function from band theory and phonon dynamics ( leung 1976 , tomlinson ( 1976 ) and carbotte ( 1990 ) and more recently in mgb@xmath2 by choi ( 2002a , 2002b ) , golubov ( 2002 ) and brinkman ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , even with all this detailed understanding of low temperature superconductivity , we are still treated to surprising new superconductors , not predicted by theory , such as the recent discovery of mgb@xmath2 with a @xmath1 of the order of 40 k ( nagamatsu 2001 ) .",
    "the situation in the high @xmath1 cuprates is not at all clear . in a recent science article ,",
    "p. w. anderson ( 2007 ) raised the issue of the very existence of pairing `` bosonic glue '' in this case , be it phonons ( johnston 2010a ) , perhaps modified by strong correlation physics ( kulic 2000 ) or some other boson exchange mechanism such as spin fluctuation ( chubukov 2008 ) within a nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model ( millis 1990 , monthoux 1994 and branch 1999 ) .",
    "returning to the question of whether or not the cooper pair binding may involve only high energy dynamics on the scale of the hubbard @xmath3 ( @xmath42 ev ) or the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ev ) or rather on the smaller scale of the spin fluctuations , the work of maier ( 2008 ) is instructive .",
    "the critical question is one of dynamics and the energy scale associated with the pairing interaction .",
    "these authors find that for both hubbard and t - j models the dominant contribution to the pairing reflect this smallest energy scale and so one can speak of a spin - fluctuation glue .",
    "it is useful to quantify their approach here .",
    "we introduce a gap function @xmath7 which depends on momentum @xmath8 as well as energy @xmath9 and has both real @xmath10 and imaginary part @xmath11 .",
    "these are related by the cauchy relation @xmath12 a useful measure of the frequency dependence of the pairing is to take @xmath9 = 0 in equation [ cauchy ] and introduce @xmath13 this quantity measures the contribution to the pairing coming from excitation energies in the range 0 to @xmath14 and by arrangement , @xmath15 will saturate to value one at @xmath16 .     and longitudinal @xmath17 phonons in mediating superconductivity in lead from maier ( 2008 ) .",
    "( a ) here @xmath18 is the imaginary part of the pb gap function versus @xmath9 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows the bosonic spectral function @xmath19 determined from tunnelling but with the peaks in @xmath18 shifted up by the gap @xmath20 .",
    "( b ) the cumulative pairing interaction @xmath21 versus @xmath14 for pb .",
    "@xmath21 reflects the transverse and longitudinal phonon contributions to the pairing . at larger values of @xmath14 , @xmath21 decreases because @xmath22 is reduced from the value that it would have just due to the phonons by the presence of the non - retarded screened coulomb pseudopotential @xmath23.,width=566 ]     versus @xmath24 for the hubbard model from maier ( 2008 ) .",
    "( b ) the d - wave projected spin susceptibility @xmath25 versus @xmath24 for the same model .",
    "we note that the major contribution to the gap function comes from low frequency excitations with an additional attractive interaction at the 5 % level from high frequency excitations .",
    ", width=566 ]    figure [ fgintro1 ] shows the results of maier ( 2008 ) for the case of the bcs superconductor pb which can be described by an isotropic electron - phonon spectral density @xmath0 shown as the dashed spectrum in the left frame and a coulomb repulsion @xmath23 of 0.1 which accounts for the electron - electron interactions .",
    "this involves the introduction of a pseudopotential rather than a bare coulomb repulsion as described by morel and anderson ( 1962 ) .",
    "solutions of the eliashberg equations for the complex gap gives the solid curve for @xmath26 .",
    "results for @xmath21 are presented in the right side frame ( b ) .",
    "we see structure at the sum of the gap @xmath20 plus the main transverse phonon frequency @xmath27 in @xmath0 as well as at @xmath28 with @xmath17 the main longitudinal frequency .",
    "most of the glue occurs in this energy range .",
    "in fact @xmath21 becomes larger than the one before it gradually decreases to one because of the nonretarded repulsive coulomb term @xmath23 .",
    "turning to the cuprates in figure [ fgintro2 ] , we reproduce from maier ( 2008 ) their results for the hubbard model . in this case",
    "the complex gap depends on momentum as well as energy @xmath9 and in the top frame ( a ) @xmath29 with a doping of @xmath30 0.8 where @xmath30 1 corresponds to half filling .",
    "three values of @xmath3 are used as labeled .",
    "it is clear that all cases show pairing glue with @xmath31 reaching @xmath32 % of its saturated value for @xmath33 7 where @xmath34 is the first nearest neighbour hopping parameter of the model . in the lower frame",
    "the d - wave projection of the spin susceptibility is plotted for @xmath35 10 and we note that its energy scale corresponds closely to the energy scale for the contribution of the pairing glue to the pairing strength which suggests that spin fluctuations form the glue .",
    "there have been other similar calculations , among these the work of kyung ( 2009 ) .",
    "they use a cellular dynamical mean - field theory for the two - dimensional hubbard model to study retardation effects in d - wave superconducting pairing .",
    "they confirm that the appropriate energy scale involved coincides with the scale of the short - range spin fluctuation and correlates with the spin susceptibility .",
    "earlier cluster dynamical mean - filed computations by haule ( 2007 ) had already produced a phase diagram for the d - wave order parameter which follows the dome behaviour as a function of doping seen for the value of the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "additional work by kancharla ( 2008 ) gives more details on the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in doped mott insulators .",
    "these results provide in part , a motivation for the experimental investigation of possible boson effects in the high @xmath1 oxides as will be reviewed here .",
    "the role of the electron - phonon interaction in the cuprates and its effect on boson structure has been addressed in many theoretical papers . here",
    "again it is not our aim to provide a comprehensive review .",
    "kulic ( 2000 ) presents the case for the electron - phonon interaction in strongly correlated systems such as the cuprates . due to the reduction in screening",
    ", a forward scattering peak appears in the electron - phonon interaction while at the same time backward scattering is suppressed .",
    "kulic concludes that under such conditions the mass enhancement factor @xmath36 associated with the d - channel which is the important quality for estimates of the value of the critical temperature , is of the same order as for the s - wave or renormalization channel . also , the transport electron - phonon coupling is much smaller than its quasiparticle counterpart which provides a direct explanation of the observation that the resistivity is linear in @xmath37 in the normal state above @xmath1 ( zeyher 1996 ) .",
    "recent local density approximation ( lda ) calculations in ybco ( heid 2008 , 2009 ) and in lsco ( giustino 2008 ) have found however , very small values of the coupling in the d - channel and conclude that the electron - phonon interaction is much too small to provide the glue for cooper pair formation .",
    "also quasiparticle mass enhancement factor renormalizations are small as is its transport counterpart .",
    "renormalization due to electron correlations beyond lda are not expected to greatly enhance these values ( zeyher 1996 ) although some have argued that this need not necessarily be the case ( reznik 2008 ) .",
    "a review emphasizing the role of phonons in arpes has been given by johnston ( 2010b ) .",
    "a discussion of a possible combined role of spin fluctuations plus a phonon part is found in johnston ( 2010a ) .",
    "another approach to the origin of kinks in arpes spectra is that of byczuk ( 2007 ) who discuss the role of hubbard subbands in strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "bauer and sangiovanni ( 2010 ) consider dispersion kinks in a hubbard model supplemented with electron - phonon coupling in a holstein model using dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "they also consider the effect of including antiferromagnetic correlations on the electron phonon interaction and find it enhances the phonon effect in the electronic dispersions . as described by datta ( 2007 )",
    ", kinks also exist in the `` effective '' dispersion curves defined by the peaks in the hole spectral density at fixed @xmath9 in the momentum distribution curve of arpes within tomonaga - luttinger liquid models which exhibit spin - charge separation . in view of all these possible effects",
    ", it is important to turn to experiment to understand better what signatures of boson structure are present and how they might be interpreted .",
    "this is the main aim of this review .    to get fine details of the electron - boson interaction tunnelling",
    "has been the spectroscopy of choice in the past .",
    "however , the same spectral density can be obtained by other experimental techniques .",
    "for example , for the elemental bcs superconductor lead , optics has given ( joyce 1970 and farnworth 1974 , 1976 ) results for @xmath0 in excellent agreement with calculations of @xmath0 ( tomlinson 1976 ) and with tunnelling ( mcmillan 1965 ) .",
    "in addition to optics a spectroscopic technique that has been particularly important in the study of the cuprate high temperature superconductors is angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "more general reviews of this powerful technique already exist ( damascelli 2003 , campuzano ( 2004 ) , eschrig 2006 , chubukov 2008 , garcia and lanzara 2010 and kordyuk 2010 ) .",
    "while optics and arpes will be our main focus , scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) ( for review see fischer 2007 ) , break junction tunnelling will also be considered as well as the very recent raman scattering data ( muschler 2010 ) .",
    "modern angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy is based on the classical photoelectric effect .",
    "a high energy photon impinges on the surface of a single crystal cleaved _ in situ _ in ultrahigh vacuum .",
    "the energy of the photo - ejected electron as well as the direction of its velocity are determined .",
    "conservation of momentum demands that the momentum component parallel to the crystal surface of the emerging electron must be equal and opposite to the momentum of the hole created in the sample . in this way",
    "the energy and momentum relationship of the occupied states below the fermi surface of a two - dimensional system can be mapped out .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fgarpes0 ] from damascelli ( 2030 ) . at present",
    "a resolution in energy of better than 1 mev and 0.1 % in angle is possible ( garcia and lanzara 2010 ) .",
    "the photocurrent magnitude depends on the product of three factors .",
    "the first is a dipole matrix element @xmath38 that depends on the initial and final electronic states , incident photon energy and polarization .",
    "while some attention needs to be paid to this factor , the other two factors are of most general interest and combine to make the technique a powerful tool that yields a detailed picture of the energy and momentum dependence of the electronic structure of the occupied states below the fermi surface .",
    "the first of these factors is the fermi dirac ( fd ) distribution function @xmath39 which states that at zero temperature only states below the fermi energy @xmath40 are accessible and at finite @xmath37 the thermal tail of the fd distribution provides some limited information on unoccupied states .",
    "the second factor , which is the most important one , is the spectral density of the charge carriers @xmath41 .",
    "it is related to the imaginary part of the electron green s function @xmath42 .",
    "the photo current intensity @xmath43 is given by the product of the three factors : @xmath44 in terms of the electronic self energy @xmath45 the spectral density is written as @xmath46 ^ 2 + \\sigma''({\\bf k},\\omega)^2 } } \\label{spectfunc}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the real and imaginary parts of @xmath45 .",
    "for free electrons , @xmath49 reduces to a dirac delta function on the band structure dispersion curves , @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 as shown in figure [ fgarpes0]b ) .",
    "when interactions are included , the quasiparticle energies are renormalized and they acquire a finite lifetime and an incoherent side band develops figure [ fgarpes0]c ) .",
    "the new energies are given by the solution of the equation @xmath52 and these can be measured in arpes experiments . in figure [ fgarpes1 ]",
    "we show results ( kaminski 2001 ) for the arpes intensity @xmath43 as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath9 for incident photon energy @xmath53 ev and temperature @xmath54 k. frame ( a ) gives a 3-d plot while frames ( b ) and ( c ) give respectively a constant energy curve called the momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) and a constant @xmath51 cut called the energy distribution curve ( edc ) .",
    "mb denotes the main band sl is a superlattice image . for ( b ) the frequency @xmath55 and",
    "hence the peak in the curve is at @xmath56 ( the fermi momentum in this direction ) .",
    "data on @xmath57 in different directions in the brillouin zone will determine the fermi surface .",
    "the line in the mdc spectrum is symmetric and close to lorentzian in shape with only a small background .",
    "by contrast ( c ) is far from lorentzian and has a large tail extending to a high binding energy ( negative values ) .",
    "these tails , also called the `` dip - hump '' structure reflect inelastic processes where , in addition to the creation of a hole in the valence band , a bosonic excitation has been created .",
    "an analysis of these tails can yield information on the bosonic spectrum that interacts with the holes .",
    "figure [ fgarpes0 ] ( c ) gives a schematic illustration of these processes .",
    "the widths of the mdc s can be analyzed to yield frequency dependent scattering rates @xmath58 which are proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath45 .",
    "modelling of the self energy with a synthetic bosonic spectrum to get a fit to the dispersion curves can be used to yield the real part of @xmath45 .     and @xmath59 .",
    "its momentum parallel to the surface equals the momentum of the hole in the filled band ( grey area in ( b ) ) .",
    "an analyzer has a slit that accepts electrons with different @xmath8 vectors and spreads them in energy with an electric field perpendicular to the slit .",

    "right panels : edcs at locations marked by the vertical lines in the middle panels . from kaminski ( 2001 ) .",
    "these data show the increase in coupling to a bosonic mode at @xmath63 mev as one moves from the nodal direction ( lower panels ) towards the antinodal direction , ( upper panels ) both in the normal and superconducting states.,width=20 ]    while the mdcs are more straight forwardly interpretable using equation [ spectfunc ] with the inverse quasiparticle lifetime @xmath64 related to @xmath65 , historically the edcs were first used in the interpretation of arpes dispersion curves . in figure [ fgarpes2 ] results for the dispersion curves",
    "are reproduced from kaminski ( 2001 ) . from top to bottom , we go from the antinodal to the nodal direction along lines shown in the inset of figure [ fgarpes1 ] ( a ) where one quarter of the brillouin zone is shown along with the fermi contour ( solid black curve ) .",
    "the left panels show the normal state dispersion curves .",
    "note the changes in slope at low energy which are signatures of a kink in dispersion , a signature of interaction with bosonic modes . in the middle panels for the superconducting state these features",
    "become stronger and we see two dispersion branches which overlap in momentum with the lower energy branch showing almost no dispersion ( change of energy ) with @xmath51 while the higher energy branch varies more , although it too remains quite flat .",
    "these dispersions correspond to the energy of the sharp peaks seen in the edc ( right panel ) while the second branch corresponds to the `` hump '' separated from the larger sharp peak at lower energy by the `` dip '' ( engelsberg and schrieffer ( 1963 ) ) .",
    "we note that the evolution of the dispersion curves in the superconducting state ( sc ) : there is a gradual closing of the gap between the two branches until a single branch emerges but with a distinct `` kink '' remaining in the nodal direction .",
    "two observations are made by kaminski ( 2001 ) .",
    "first , the energy of the gap structure which evolves into the kink is reasonably fixed along the fermi surface . interpreting the kink as a signature of an interaction with a bosonic excitation suggests that this excitation has a fixed and well defined energy .",
    "second , the normal state dispersions are comparatively smooth which is taken as evidence that the mechanism involved is coupling to a collective mode which vanishes at temperature @xmath66 , as does the well known spin resonance seen in inelastic neutron scattering at 41 mev in optimally doped .",
    "it is also clear from this figure and this is noted by kaminski ( 2001 ) that the coupling to the collective mode increases as one progresses from the nodal to the antinodal direction .",
    "we need to keep this in mind in the discussions of the origin of the boson involved .",
    "however , as we have already noted , a more careful examination of the normal state dispersions , and as we will see below in more detail , shows that strong bosonic interactions are present in the normal state .",
    "the peak - dip - hump structure in the antinodal direction ( at @xmath67 in the brillouin zone ) has a long history ( dessau 1991 , 1992 , shen and dessau 1995 , and ding 1996 ) .",
    "it was interpreted by many to be distinctly related to the coupling to the spin - one resonance seen in inelastic magnetic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "an early formulation was given by norman ( 1997 ) and a detailed comparison between the charge carrier self energy due to a sharp boson mode of momentum @xmath68 and the results in figure [ fgarpes2 ] was made ( eschrig and norman 2000 ) with excellent qualitative agreement noted .",
    "an independent but closely related formulation of the relation between arpes data and the neutron resonance peak was given by abanov and chubukov ( 1999 ) with much the same conclusions .",
    "this work was questioned by kee ( 2002 ) on the grounds that the spin resonance had too small a spectral weight and coupling to charge carriers to have a strong effect on the electronic self energy .",
    "a response by abanov ( 2002 ) provides results of calculations that show that even though the resonance has a small spectral weight , this weight is confined to a small region in momentum space and energy and consequently this resonance can provide clear signatures in electronic properties .",
    "more details can be found in eschrig and norman ( 2003 ) .",
    "an important fact underlying these calculations is the disappearance of the resonance at @xmath1 in many systems although for underdoped materials a remanence remains up to a higher temperature @xmath69 , the pseudogap energy scale .",
    "the evolution of the self energy as one moves from the @xmath67 to the @xmath68 direction is also an important feature of the data .",
    "later we will return to this issue and discuss how eventually it was recognized that bilayer splitting can have a strong effect on arpes results in the antinodal direction and this needs to be accounted for before the dispersion curves can be analyzed for self energy effects .",
    "modifications of the picture just described are needed but some elements of the explanation given remain valid .",
    "finally , we note the experimental study of campuzano ( 1999 ) extended the work to doping as well as momentum and temperature dependencies and found that the hump scales with the peak and persists above @xmath1 in the pseudogap state . also the inferred mode energy has the same doping dependence as does the magnetic resonance peak position seen in inelastic neutron scattering ( fong 1999 and he 2001 ) .",
    "they conclude that the peak - dip - hump structure arises from the electronic interaction with a collective mode with a wave vector ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "as we will see below , the sharp resonance that appears at @xmath1 is only a part of the bosonic spectrum .",
    "in addition , there is a broad background of excitations that is present in the normal state and will be the ultimate trigger of superconductivity at @xmath1 .",
    "however , before we review further the recent arpes studies of the bosonic spectra , we must address the problem of bilayer splitting which needs to be considered as it could mask intrinsic self energy effects .    in systems with two copper oxygen layers such as , the family most studied with arpes , the degeneracy of the two bands is split into a bonding and an antibonding band .",
    "an unfortunate coincidence is that this splitting energy is of the same order as the energy of the bosonic excitations discussed previously .",
    "illustrated in figure [ fgarpes17 ] are the arpes results by feng ( 2001 ) on the fermi surface of overdoped bi2212 ( @xmath71 k ) .",
    "we see clearly the bonding ( bb ) and the antibonding ( ab ) bands as well as their superstructure replicas .",
    "note that in this sample no splitting is observed in the nodal direction .",

    "we clearly see two different dispersion curves , bonding and antibonding . with increasing photon energy",
    "a single bonding band dominates in the right hand frame .",
    "this shows that photon energy has a significant effect on the photoemission matrix elements that determine the admixture of the antibonding vs. the bonding bands",
    ". it should be clear that different admixtures of bonding and antibonding bands could be mistaken for self energy effects when in reality the structure is due to bilayer splitting . for additional discussion of bonding and antibonding bands",
    "see among others chuang ( 2001 ) , yamasaki ( 2007 ) , kordyuk ( 2002 ) , borisenko ( 2003 ) , kim ( 2003 ) and for a review kordyuk ( 2010 ) .",

    "this procedure is simple : since the real and imaginary parts of the self energy can be measured independently by edc and mdc , they should be related by kk transformations .",

    "they point to a drop in the quasiparticle scattering rate seen below the kink energy as further evidence for this interpretation ( lanzara 2006 ) .",
    "this interpretation has been disputed by kodyuk ( 2006 ) who argue , on the basis of recent high resolution | arpes data , that there is a strong dependence of the frequency of the kink with doping and temperature which rules out any phonon scenario as an explantation of the kink .",

    "the second curve does not have the peak around 100 mev seen in the superconductivity case which falls , as we expect , at an energy closer to @xmath295 mev .    in the maximum entropy inversions that we have described so far",
    "an unbiased mode was used at each temperature .",
    "it is instructive to use instead a biased mode in which the starting spectral density for inversion at temperature @xmath37 is taken to be the converged answer obtained for the previous next lowest temperature .",
    "while this usually provides equally good fits to the scattering rate data , it gives solutions for @xmath256 which show considerably less temperature dependencies and are closer to those obtained on the basis of equation [ moreexact ] with a least squares fit of a histogram as in figure [ fgoptics16 ] .",
    "part of , but not all , the temperature smearing found in figure [ fgoptics14 ] can be traced to the method of inversion itself .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fgoptics16a ] from unpublished work of hwang ( 2011 ) where we show results of two numerical simulations labeled calculated biased ( green diamond ) and unbiased ( blue pentagon ) and which we compare with the original inversion ( red hexagon ) of the data in bi2212 opt96a of figure [ fgoptics14 ] .",
    "what is done is that the @xmath256 recovered at @xmath296 30 k is retained at all temperatures and the conductivity calculated from the kubo formula and full eliashberg equations .",
    "the temperature and frequency dependent optical scattering rate so obtained are then inverted using an unbiased and also a biased technique .",
    "this leads respectively to the blue pentagon and green diamond results for peak position , width , height and area ( clockwise from top left ) shown in figure [ fgoptics16a ] .",
    "it is clear that biased or unbiased results are quite similar with greatest differences seen for peak height .",
    "since @xmath256 was never changed with temperature , the significant temperature dependence seen for the width and height of the peak around 60 mev in the spectral density used , is due to the maximum entropy inversion itself .",
    "it is not in the input spectral density .",
    "nevertheless , when these results are compared with the red hexagon symbols of figure [ fgoptics16a ] which represent inversion based on the actual optical data found for bi2212 opt96a , we see that the real data shows much more evolution with temperature than do the numerical simulations .",
    "thus , even though maximum entropy inversions do incorporate some extrinsic temperature shift towards higher energies , much of the temperature evolution found in the data represents a real shift in the spectral function itself .",

    "these transitions provide an average over all the bosons defined in the brillouin zone and as such the resulting spectral density should retain an identifiable similarity in shape to the local i.e. momentum averaged spin susceptibility .",
    "vignolle ( 2007 ) have given results for the local spin susceptibility in and find a peak centred around 18 mev and another near 40 to 70 mev as well as smaller features extending as high as 150 mev .",

    "the results for @xmath256 obtained for optics appear in the main frame of the middle panel of this same figure for several temperatures identified in the top frame . in the top frame",
    ", we also show the data for the optical scattering as well as the theoretical results obtained from the kubo formula and eliashberg equations with the @xmath256 retrieved from a maximum entropy fit ( middle frame ) .",
    "first , we note that the @xmath256 at 30 and 50 k do not differ much and both show distinct peaks emphasized by the solid black arrows at the energy seen in the neutron data . as the temperature",
    "is increased the @xmath256 obtained from optics evolve towards a single peak structure .",
    "the low energy peak at 15 mev is now gone as is the sharp peak at 44 mev which is replaced by a single much broader peak around 60 mev .",
    "this evolution in temperature is in qualitative agreement with the neutron data shown in the inset at 300 k ( open circles ) where we see the peak at 15 mev seen at 12 k ( solid squares ) has completely disappeared .",
    "this striking resemblance of the optically derived @xmath256 and the local susceptibility is taken as evidence that the spin fluctuations play an important role in the many body renormalizations seen in . in the lower frame of figure [ fgoptics20 ]",
    "we show results for the real part of the optical self energy in which the two peak structure at 15 and 44 mev are clearly seen in the quantity without analysis .",
    "this is expected from theory as shown in the inset of the lower frame of the figure leaving little doubt that there are peaks at these energies in the electron boson spectral density @xmath256 .",
    "a somewhat different approach to inversion of normal state optical data has been presented by van heumen ( 2009 ) .",
    "they work with the equation [ moreexact ] for the conductivity in the normal state at finite temperature and use a least square fit to data based on a histogram form for the spectral density @xmath306 . in this way",
    "they obtain the results produced in figure [ fgoptics16 ] .",
    "several different families of cuprates as labeled in the figure are considered and in each case at several temperatures . in particular , we focus on their data for opd88 which might be compared with the data from hwang ( 2007b ) shown in the left hand upper frame ( a ) of figure [ fgoptics14 ] for a comparable material .",
    "both spectra have a large peak around 50 - 60 mev followed by a valley and then a second peak providing a long high energy tail or background . at 100",
    "k the peak - height is of order 1 in both sets of results .",
    "the main difference between the two spectra is the evolution with a temperature between 100 and 300 k. while hwang ( 2007b ) find a clear evolution towards a broad spectrum with a single peak that has moved towards 100 mev , van heumen ( 2009 ) find much less change with temperature and note that the peak at 50 - 60 mev remains largely unchanged and is robust .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fgoptics12 ] both the optical scattering rate ( left hand column ) and corresponding real part of the optical self energy ( right hand column ) become rather smooth and unstructured with increasing temperature , and consequently an accurate determination of the underlying spectral density becomes harder . as we saw in figure [ fgoptics10 ] , temperature tends to smear out some of the features of the recovered spectral density whether one uses a second derivative technique , singular value decomposition , or maximum entropy .",
    "another point of agreement between the data in figures [ fgoptics14 ] and [ fgoptics16 ] on bi-2212 is that in both sets of data the mass enhancement factor associated with the peak is reduced with increasing doping while the background is more constant .",
    "returning to the middle column in figure [ fgoptics16 ] , we note that in hg1201 opd07 van heumen ( 2009 ) find that @xmath306 has very much the same shape as for bi2212 opd88 , a large peak around 50 - 60 mev , a dip , followed by a second step which provides a background extending to higher energies of 300 mev .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the findings of yang ( 2009 ) .        in the work described so far on optics no attempt was made to account explicitly for the opening of a pseudogap which is known to exist in underdoped cuprates ( timusk and statt 1999 and norman 2005 ) .",
    "in particular equation [ moreexact ] holds only under the assumption of an infinite band approximation with a constant bare band density of states .",
    "formula [ tau1 ] with kernel @xmath266 of equation [ shulga ] , while it accounts for finite temperature effects , does not include the possibility of an energy dependent dressed electronic density of states .",
    "the study of effects of an energy dependent density of states @xmath307 on normal and superconducting state properties has a long history , in particular in relation to the a15 compounds as described by mitrovi ( 1983a,1983b ) .",
    "more recent work has been aimed at understanding the influence of these finite band effects on the quasiparticle self energy ( doan and marsiglio 2003 and cappelluti and pietronero 2003 ) and optical properties ( knigavko 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) . following the work of allen ( 1971 , 1976 ) , mitrovi ( 1985 ) derived an approximate formula which is a generalization of equation [ allen ] to include energy dependence in the effective renormalized electronic density of state defined by @xmath307 . following this work sharapov and carbotte ( 2005 )",
    "generalized it further by including both temperature dependence , as in the work of shulga ( 1991 ) , and energy dependent electronic density of state , as in the work of mitrovi ( 1985 ) to yield : @xmath308\\nonumber \\\\&\\times&[n_b(\\omega ) + 1 - f(z-\\omega)][f(z-\\omega ) - f(z+\\omega ) ] \\label{sharapov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath309 is the fully renormalized frequency dependent density of states .",
    "for a constant density of states this formula reduces to equation [ shulga ] and at zero temperature it simplifies to : @xmath310 \\label{sharapov0}\\ ] ] which is the equation given by mitrovi and fiorucci ( 1985 ) .",

    "it follows directly from equation [ sharapov1 ] that a full gap @xmath315 in @xmath314 for example , will look like the case of a constant density of states but with a boson mode set at @xmath316 .",

    "analysis of the shift in energy of the reflectance shoulder around 400 to 500   leads these authors to conclude that the feature can not be due to a copper - oxygen phonon stretching mode and that it is largely electronic in origin . the observation is consistent with the evidence presented in this review that phonon effects are small and can perhaps only be seen with probes that emphasize the nodal direction where the magnetic contribution is smaller .",

    "this is in contrast the absence of doping dependence for optical phonons in bi-2223 ( boris 2002 ) . taken together these observations lead the authors to favour coupling to spin fluctuations as the cause of the observed dip in the stm spectra .",
    "additional results for a sample of bi-2223 with @xmath353 k at @xmath354 k by de castro ( 2008 ) are shown in figure [ fgtunnelling7 ] . the one dashed line locates the coherence peak of @xmath352 , the solid line the dip position and the second dashed line the minimum in the @xmath335 spectrum as was used by lee ( 2006 ) to locate their phonon at 52 mev in bi-2212 . while the dip energy decreases from 39 to 35 mev corresponding in this case to a collective mode energy @xmath346 decrease from 34 to 24 mev , the position of the dashed line is almost independent of the gap value and is at @xmath355 mev close to the value of 52 mev quoted above .",
    "another recent study by das ( 2008 ) has further confirmed in hole doped ndba@xmath2cu@xmath167o@xmath168 that the gap and the collective mode energies are anticorrelated favouring more a spin fluctuation rather than a phonon explanation .",

    "one can introduce an angular dependent version of this function as @xmath360 . within a continuum model for the electronic structure",
    "the function entering the usual spectral density would correspond to a straight angular average while for raman there would be a further @xmath361 weighting for b@xmath173 and @xmath362 for b@xmath363 in the integral over angles .",

    "we show in ( c ) results ( schachinger 2006 ) obtained from optical data ( tu 2002 ) and in ( d ) a result ( schachinger and carbotte 2008 ) obtained from nodal direction arpes ( zhang 2008a).,width=566 ]     ( dimensionless ) as a function of energy @xmath9 in mev from b@xmath173 raman scattering rates using a biased maximum entropy inversion as described in the text from muschler ( 2010 ) .",

    "this distribution is very close to the optically derived spectrum found in schachinger ( 2006 ) for a comparable sample of bi-2212 measured by tu ( 2002 ) with a peak around 40 mev and overall very similar shape ( frame ( c ) ) . for the b@xmath363 ( nodal direction )",
    "spectrum , the peak around 30 mev remains but is smaller in magnitude than for b@xmath173 3 % of the area under the curve as opposed to 23 % in b@xmath173 but , as it has the same energy is probably of the same origin .",
    "both could be associated with scattering about ( @xmath364,@xmath364 ) which would favor antinodal as opposed to nodal direction scattering from one point in the fermi surface to another again on the fermi surface .",
    "it is instructive to compare the b@xmath363 spectrum with that obtained from nodal direction arpes described in the previous section ( see panel ( a ) of figure [ fgarpes14 ] ) and reproduced in the lower right hand frame ( d ) .",
    "this spectrum looks a lot like b@xmath363 but with a very important difference , it has a prominent peak at 65 mev , a much higher energy than found in the other case .",
    "it could be that this peak is related to scattering from a different boson , perhaps a phonon with scattering confined to the region of the nodal direction and so not sufficiently important in the raman and optical cases because of averaging away from the nodal regions in momentum space .",
    "this possibility is supported by the recent work of schachinger ( 2009b ) and further elaborated upon by schachinger and carbotte ( 2010 ) .",
    "the recent isotope effect experiments of iwasawa ( 2008 ) described in our previous section on arpes can be understood on the assumption that only the sharp peak above the background in the @xmath256 shown in the lower right hand frame of figure [ fgraman1 ] is shifted in substituting @xmath115o by @xmath116o and this involves only 10 % of the area under the total spectral density , or a mass enhancement @xmath36 of about 0.2 .    in maximum entropy inversion one needs to specify an initial starting value for the spectral density . in the unbiased inversion mode",
    "this is taken as flat , while in the biased mode the next lowest temperature converged solution for @xmath256 is used as the starting value for the next higher temperature run .",
    "results for the biased mode are presented in the top two frames of figure [ fgraman2 ] and these are to be compared with the top frames of figure [ fgraman1 ] obtained by unbiased inversion .",
    "we note that both methods give very similar results except for one important difference .",
    "the unbiased mode shows more temperature evolution than does the biased case .",
    "this does not translate into important differences for the value of mass enhancement and its evolution with temperature .",
    "this is seen in the bottom frame of figure [ fgraman2 ] where we plot @xmath36 in the two cases as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "the differences do , however , have impact on the possible interpretation of the boson spectral density . for phonons one would expect little @xmath37 dependence of the peak frequencies and also little broadening , while for spin fluctuation the opposite holds . in that regard ,",
    "the unbiased maximum entropy results differ from those obtained by least square fit of the formula for @xmath256 as shown in figure [ fgoptics16 ] .",
    "this alternative method shows less temperature evolution than the unbiased maximum entropy method .",
    "the exact source of this difference is not fully understood . in maximum entropy noise",
    "always leads to some smearing of the resulting distributions .",
    "an alternate interpretation of boson structure seen in raman has been presented very recently by caprara ( 2010 ) .",
    "their data is for the la@xmath365sr@xmath297cuo@xmath249 family and an aim of their work is to unravel the nature of the glue responsible for pairing .",
    "they do not provide inversions of their data .",
    "instead they proceed with calculations of raman response for b@xmath173 and b@xmath363 symmetry which they then compare with experiments .",
    "the calculations employ the equivalent of a shulga ( 1991 ) approximation adapted to the raman cross section as opposed to optics .",
    "separate spectral densities are introduced for spin and charge fluctuations with different characteristic wave vectors @xmath366 ( @xmath364,@xmath364 ) for spins and @xmath367 ( @xmath368 , 0 ) , ( 0 , @xmath368 ) for charges with each having its own dynamics and collective modes ( boson ) .",
    "while the spin fluctuations correspond to the proximity of the antiferromagnetic state , the charge fluctuations correspond to the tendency towards stripes or checkerboard order .",
    "they find guidance from a selection rule in momentum space which emphasizes the spin in b@xmath173 and charge in b@xmath363 symmetry . at any doping",

    "k ) obtained from infrared reflectivity measurements ( solid and dashed lines ) [ 17 ] . the fwhm is defined by the horizontal arrow in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "after kaminski ( 2000),width=453 ]    the experiments presented in this review , primarily arpes and optical conductivity , of the hole doped high temperature superconductors , lead us to the strong conclusion that the mobile charge carriers are scattered by a spectrum of bosonic excitations .",
    "although these two techniques are quite different they yield similar results . confirming tunnelling and raman experiments have also been published .",
    "an early comparison between arpes and optics was made by kaminsky ( 2000 ) . as figure [ fgconclusion1 ] shows the quasiparticle lifetime , as measured by the arpes mdc widths , tracks in both magnitude and structure the free carrier life time as determined from the optical conductivity in the same material ( bi-2212 ) .",
    "this convergence of arpes and optical self energies have been confirmed in many additional experiments as we have shown in this review .",
    "for example , figure [ fgoptics13 ] shows this for the real part of the quasiparticle self energy .",
    "but such comparisons are of limited use since , on theoretical grounds , one expects to see somewhat different results for the two techniques ( hwang et al .",
    "first arpes is momentum resolved whereas the optical self energy is a weighted average over the fermi surface . in both cases",
    "there are momentum dependent matrix elements that have to be taken into account .",
    "more accurate experiments may identify these differences in the future .",
    "nevertheless , there is a remarkably uniform bosonic spectrum that emerges from the various experiments . at low temperature",
    "the spectrum has a peak whose frequency varies from 15 to 75 mev depending on the material and doping level .",
    "this frequency is generally proportional to the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 as shown in figure [ fgoptics19 ] , but is totally absent in some materials with very low transition temperatures .",
    "the amplitude of the peak is strongly dependent on both temperature and doping .",
    "it is strongest at low temperatures in the superconducting state but weakens at higher temperatures . in some cases , such as the optimally doped ybco",
    ", it vanishes at @xmath1 but in other cases persists into the normal state such as underdoped ybco .",
    "in addition to the peak there is a continuum in all the samples extending to 200 to 400 mev as shown in figure [ fgarpes14 ] . the continuum seems to be fairly temperature independent but develops a gap at low temperature .",
    "the peak appears to be in the middle of this gap as shown in figure [ fgoptics14 ] and [ fgoptics17 ] .",
    "we next address the question of the origin of the bosonic spectrum .",
    "the main candidates for this are spin fluctuations and phonons .",
    "while there seems to be a consensus among the arpes groups that the spectrum is magnetic , arguments are made from time to time in favour of phonons .",
    "the case for the spin fluctuation scenario is strong .",
    "first the bosonic function appears to change with temperature , the peak weakens as the temperature is increased and shifts in frequency to higher values . as figure [ fgoptics19 ] shows the peak frequency",
    "is systematically related to the transition temperature of the superconductor .",
    "further , the spectrum of fluctuations extends to energies of the order of 300 mev .",
    "none of these properties are expected for a phonon .",
    "finally , where magnetic neutron spectra are available , the peak in the q - averaged susceptibility is close to the peak extracted from arpes or optical conductivity spectra",
    ".    however , there remain compelling arguments for some role of phonons . in particular , as recent high resolution arpes data for nodal quasi particles show there is an oxygen isotope effect on the low frequency kink which is associated with the peak in the bosonic spectrum .",
    "this effect could be understood in terms of a phonon contribution at the 10 percent level to the self energy of at least the nodal quasiparticles .    in summary , in our review of bosonic excitations in high temperature superconductors , we have identified these excitations as spin fluctuations .",
    "they are responsible for the kinks in the arpes dispersion curves and the spectral features in the optical conductivity .",
    "their contribution is strong enough to account for the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "but there remain several questions that need to be answered before we can claim to fully understand high temperature superconductivity .",
    "what determines the nature of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum ?",
    "for example , why is it so different in lsco as compared to the three layer mercury material ?",
    "what is the role of the pseudogap ?",
    "is it a coincidence that near the doping level where the pseudogap vanishes , @xmath369 0.19 -0.23 , the peak in the magnetic spectrum is replaced by a uniform featureless background ?",
    "we look to future experiments , particularly magnetic neutron scattering to address some of these issues .",
