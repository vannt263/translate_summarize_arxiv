    "x - ray emission from hot gas appears to be a generic feature of massive halos .",
    "hot gaseous halos suffuse nearly every galaxy cluster and many galaxy groups ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and they are also very common ( possibly ubiquitous ) around massive elliptical galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , including field ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the hot halo is strongly affected by both feedback from the galaxy and by accretion from the intergalactic medium ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these processes , which are fundamental for understanding galaxy formation , can therefore be studied through x - ray observations of the hot halos .    in the aggregate",
    ", x - ray emission can be described by power - law relations as a function of stellar mass ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and halo mass ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although the scatter in these relations is considerable .",
    "potentially active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) might also be important .",
    "for example , the slopes of these power - law relations differ from the self - similar prediction , which can be used as a constraint on the effect of agn feedback ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for clusters and groups the luminosity and temperature of the gas",
    "are also related ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but this relation seems to break down at the scale of galactic halos ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . some of the scatter in these relations may be correlated with the degree of rotational support in the central galaxy as well ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another important issue is the baryon fraction of massive halos . in galaxy clusters ,",
    "the hot halos contain the overwhelming majority of the baryons associated with the cluster ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although the stellar phase begins to grow in importance as the halo mass decreases .",
    "an open question is the contribution of the gas phase in group and galaxy halos .",
    "if it is sufficiently massive , then the baryon fraction remains constant from galaxy clusters ( which are nearly baryon - complete ; @xcite ) down to isolated galaxies .",
    "current censuses appear to show a declining baryon ( stars + ism + hot gas ) fraction as the halo mass decreases ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , suggesting a problem of `` missing baryons '' from galaxies , but significant questions remain .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite find a self - similar relation as a function of halo mass for the hot gas pressure as probed by the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "this suggests that , at least within the planck beam ( typically several galactic virial radii ) , the cosmic baryon fraction is approximately recovered in hot gas ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "there are also claims of individual elliptical galaxies with extremely massive gaseous halos that bring the baryon fractions of the systems up to the cosmological value ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although for at least one of these claims it has been shown that the spectral modeling employed for the analysis violates x - ray surface brightness constraints and therefore significantly overestimates the total hot gas mass @xcite .",
    "many simulations predict that the density profile of the hot halo should systematically flatten as the halo mass decreases , due to the increasing importance of galactic feedback which inflates the entropy of the hot halo ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". a flatter density profile would have less pronounced x - ray emission , potentially reconciling the sz results with the x - ray constraints .",
    "around spiral galaxies , the picture is a bit different .",
    "starbursting galaxies produce x - ray emitting winds ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but extended gaseous halos have generally proven to be very difficult to detect around spiral galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the exceptions are the most massive spiral galaxies .",
    "extensive hot halos have been detected around the giant spirals ngc 1961 , ugc 12591 , ngc 6753 , and 2masx j23453268 - 0449256 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a weak rosat detection of hot gas around ngc 266 @xcite , and suggestion of extended hot gas around a stack of rosat images of nearby isolated spirals @xcite .",
    "it is unclear what explains the difficulty of detecting hot gaseous halos around massive spiral galaxies .",
    "weak lensing studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) generally find that massive blue centrals and massive red centrals obey different @xmath3 relations , so that at fixed stellar mass , massive blue galaxies lie in less massive halos than red galaxies .",
    "if the gaseous halo is responding primarily to the potential of the dark matter halo , this could plausibly explain the relative x - ray faintness of hot halos around spiral galaxies .",
    "alternatively , if the hot halo is tightly coupled to the galaxy ( through feedback , accretion , or some combination of the two ) , then the differences in feedback and accretion between spirals and ellipticals might explain the different hot halo properties .    around the massive spirals",
    ", the hot gas generally appears to be smoothly distributed with approximate azimuthal symmetry , and has been detected to radii of 60 kpc or so from the galaxy ( although there is no indication that the halo truncates here ) .",
    "the temperatures of the hot halos are generally close to the expected virial temperatures of these systems , suggesting the hot gas is roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo potential .",
    "comparisons with cosmological simulations have been able to reproduce the x - ray emission around spirals ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although these comparisons have been unsuccessful in reproducing the x - ray properties of spirals and ellipticals simultaneously . a unified picture of the x - ray circumgalactic medium is still lacking .",
    "it is particularly important to push the x - ray observations of spiral galaxies to larger radii , to probe the regime where most of the mass in the halo is predicted to lie , and to be able to constrain the properties of the dark halo and the hot halo simultaneously .",
    "the real quantities of interest are the radial density and temperature profiles of the gas ( or equivalently the entropy and pressure profiles ) , since these encode the feedback history of the galaxy and determine the behavior of the hot halo .",
    "the temperature profile can easily be measured from the x - ray spectrum , assuming enough photons are available to divide the field into several annuli .",
    "so far no observations have been deep enough to permit this measurement for the hot halo of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the density profile can be inferred from the x - ray surface brightness profile , using an assumed gas temperature and metallicity profile and a few assumptions to deproject the observations .",
    "typically spherical symmetry and a flat abundance profile are assumed , as well as either a flat temperature profile ( leading to a `` beta profile '' for the density ; @xcite ) or a temperature profile appropriate for a cool - core galaxy cluster ( leading to a modified `` beta profile '' for the density ; @xcite ) .",
    "the assumed metallicity has a significant effect on the final result , since the plausible range of gas metallicities spans more than an order of magnitude ( roughly 1/10 solar to slightly super - solar ) . for metallicities in this range ,",
    "the conversion from soft - band surface brightness to density depends approximately on the square root of the gas metallicity . in terms of the total gas mass ,",
    "the extrapolation to large radii is even more significant since the hot halo is typically only detected out to about a tenth of the virial radius ; most of the inferred gas mass lies at larger radii where we have few constraints on the density profile .",
    "the farther out the surface brightness profile can be measured , the more reliable the extrapolation becomes , leading to better estimates of the total hot halo mass .",
    "in order to improve the constraints on the density profile , and to make a first measurement of a temperature profile , we re - observed the giant spiral galaxy ngc 1961 with xmm - newton for an additional 215 ks ( adding to the 74 ks of observations of this galaxy already taken with xmm - newton and presented in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we report our analysis of these observations of ngc 1961 . in section 2",
    "we discuss the data reduction . in section 3",
    "we present a spatial analysis of this galaxy , and in section 4 we present a spectral analysis . in section 5",
    "we combine these analyses and measure the pressure and entropy profiles of the hot halo . in section 6 we discuss our results in the context of the `` missing baryons '' problem and in comparison to isolated elliptical galaxies .",
    "ngc 1961 is an extremely massive late - type spiral galaxy .",
    "based on its recessional velocity of 3934 km / s listed in the nasa extragalactic database , and an assumed planck cosmology @xcite with @xmath4 = 67.8 km / s / mpc , we estimate the distance of ngc 1961 to be 58.0 mpc , so that one arcminute corresponds to 16.6 kpc .",
    "the k - band luminosity of this galaxy is then @xmath5 , corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath6 ( assuming a m / l ratio of 0.6 , which is the rough expectation based on its k - band luminosity ; @xcite ) . for the b - v@xmath7 color of this galaxy , a @xcite initial mass function ( imf )",
    "gives the same m / l ratio , but a @xcite mass function gives a m / l ratio of 1.2 , yielding an even larger stellar mass for this galaxy .",
    "however , this latter m / l ratio is disfavored by @xcite , who use both population synthesis and imf - independent constraints to determine a nearly universal m / l ratio of 0.57 in the k - band , close to our value of 0.6 .",
    "the inclination - corrected hi rotation velocity is 340 km / s ( haan et al . 2008 ) at a projected distance of 43 kpc ( although it reaches higher values ",
    "up to about 450 km / s  at smaller radii ) .",
    "the virial radius of this galaxy is approximately 490 kpc , as we discuss in section 5.1 .",
    "we use the coordinates from the nasa extragalactic database for the center of the galaxy .",
    "we obtained nine observations of ngc 1961 with xmm - newton , ranging from 22 - 27 ks in length each .",
    "the aimpoints of each observation were varied such that they formed a @xmath8 grid , with a typical separation between aimpoints of about an arcminute .",
    "this layout makes the data reduction and spectral fitting more cumbersome , but it offers the advantages of flattening out the exposure map around the galaxy and reducing the effects of vignetting .",
    "it also allows us to identify and separate various non - astrophysical background components ( soft protons , instrumental background , solar wind charge exchange ) from the astrophysical backgrounds like the galactic halo and the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "we also re - analyzed the two previous xmm - newton observations of this galaxy which were originally discussed in @xcite ( hereafter b13 ) .",
    "the list of all 11 observations is presented in table 1 .",
    ".xmm - newton observations of ngc 1961 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    the inner three regions ( which overlap with the disk of the galaxy ) show significant improvement with a 2-t model , while the outer two regions ( which only cover the hot halo ) do not show much improvement with a 2-t model .",
    "this seems intuitively reasonable , and one can imagine that one component could describe the hot halo and the other could describe the hot ism of the disk . in general , the first component has a low metalllicity and contains most of the mass ; its temperature , metallicity , and density behave like the 1-t fits shown in the previous section .",
    "this component can be associated with the hot halo of the galaxy .",
    "note that , while the emission measures in table 3 are larger than the fiducial emission measures , this difference stems from the lower metallicites in the 2-t fit as compared to the fiducial model ( which has @xmath9 ) .",
    "the second component is more poorly constrained , but generally has a higher metallicity and a lower emission measure .",
    "this component can be associated with the hot interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "the 2-t model therefore seems to broadly support our picture of the hot gas in and around ngc 1961 .",
    "unfortunately there are not sufficient photons to do a more detailed analysis of the ism of this galaxy at present .",
    "in this section we examine the surface brightness profile of the x - ray emission around ngc 1961 . we analyze the soft - band and hard - band images generated in section 2 , as well as model images of the various background components .",
    "the esas ` mos_back ` and ` pn_back ` routines generate model particle background images automatically , and we use the fit parameters from our fit to the background at large radii as inputs to the the esas ` soft_proton ` and ` swcx ` routines in order to generate models of the soft proton background and the swcx backgrounds for each observation and each detector ( these two backgrounds are only generated for the soft band , however ) .",
    "for each type of image , we use the ` merge_comp_xmm ` routine to combine all 30 images together into a single merged image .",
    "we also use this routine to combine the 30 exposure maps together to generate a merged exposure map .",
    "we present the merged , exposure - corrected , soft - band image in figure 5 , which was created with the ` merge_comp_xmm ` routine and has the qpb , soft proton , and swcx backgrounds all subtracted .",
    "note that * this routine applies no weighting between the mos1 , mos2 , and pn detectors , but instead adds the images ( in counts ) directly * ; this has the effect of weighting the pn image more than the mos images due to the larger effective area of the pn detector .",
    "we divide each image by the merged exposure map and construct surface brightness profiles in figure 6 .",
    "the net soft - band signal flattens to a constant value at large radii ; we use this mean value as the value for the x - ray background in this field over the soft band . the x - ray background ( the combination of the cxb , galactic halo , and local bubble ) is the largest background component , followed by the particle background , the soft proton background , and finally the swcx background . the sky background estimated from figure 6 is consistent with the 3/4 kev background for the same region measured from rosat as well . note that the particle background and the proton background appear to turn upwards at large radii ; this is because these backgrounds are not focused by the telescope s mirrors and therefore do not suffer the same vignetting as the x - ray backgrounds .",
    "dividing by the exposure map therefore overestimates these backgrounds at large radii .",
    "this should not be a major issue for our analysis , since it does not begin to matter until radii of 100 kpc or more , which is outside the range within which we can measure the hot halo .    in these profiles",
    "we also show , but do not subtract , the estimated contribution of x - ray binaries to the soft band .",
    "we estimate this contribution in two different ways .",
    "one method ( the cyan line ) uses the hard - band x - ray image and model backgrounds .",
    "we determine the surface brightness profile of the hard - band emission and multiply this profile by a factor of 1.67 ( the scaling into the soft - band summed mos1+mos2+pn counts for a @xmath10 powerlaw with galactic absorption ) to generate the estimated xrb profile in the soft band .",
    "for the other method ( magenta line ) , we use the k - band image of this galaxy from 2mass @xcite to estimate the k - band surface brightness profile , then convert to the soft band using the scaling relation for lmxbs from @xcite ( this conversion is also described in more detail in @xcite ) .",
    "these two methods agree reasonably well , both showing a subdominant but somewhat uncertain xrb contribution in the central region , which falls off quickly beyond about 1.5 arcmin ( 23 kpc ) and becomes insignificant at larger radii .",
    "we also verify that our results are consistent between the spectral and spatial analyses .",
    "this is important to check ( anderson and bregman 2014 ) , especially with the complexity of our background model . to check this",
    ", we plot the surface brightness profile of the hot gas as determined from each technique , in figure 7 .",
    "the black line shows the result of the spatial analysis , which is the remaining soft - band emission after subtracting the estimated cxb , quiescent particle background , soft proton background , solar wind charge exchange background , and xrb emission as estimated from the hard - band image ( the cyan line in figure 6 ) .",
    "we restrict this plot to the mos instruments , since the pn instrument has a different effective area .",
    "the red points are the results of the spectral analysis ( using the fiducial model ) , where we have converted the apec component describing the hot halo ( including galactic and intrinsic absorption ) into a soft - band count rate for the mos detectors .",
    "the agreement is excellent within the @xmath1 42 kpc where the spectral fits are robust . in the outer spectral regions , where the significance of the hot gas component is less than 3@xmath11 ,",
    "the spectral model predicts far lower surface brightness than the observed spatial profile .",
    "however , here the hot gas emission comprises less than about 10% of the total soft - band signal , and it is not possible to say with certainty what the true emission looks like at such low surface brightnesses .",
    "we discard these outer regions from the joint analysis below .",
    "( dotted line ) .",
    "black points with open circles denote negative values which have been multiplied by @xmath12 to allow plotting with a logarithmic y - axis .",
    "red points with open circles are spectral fits where the significance of the hot gas component is below 3@xmath11 .",
    "the results from the spectral and spatial methods largely agree within @xmath13 kpc . at larger radii , where the surface brightness of the hot gas is below about 10% of the total signal ,",
    "we can not tell which is correct : the profile from the spatial method , the profile from the spectral method , or neither .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "now that we have performed both a spectral analysis and a spatial analysis , and shown that they give consistent results , in this section we explore the physical properties of the hot halo .",
    "first , we deproject the spectral results in order to estimate the hot gas density profile .",
    "conceptually , we follow a similar procedure to that of @xcite , although these data have much lower s / n than their observations of the perseus cluster so we make a few modifications to that procedure .    first , we generate a simple estimate for the emission measure of the hot halo at very large radii . to do this",
    ", we fit a power - law to the hot gas component of the observed surface brightness profile at large radii , finding a logarithmic slope of @xmath14 for the surface brightness as a function of radius .",
    "this corresponds to a slope of @xmath15 for the density as a function of radius , which is equivalent to @xmath16 of 0.75 in the standard @xmath16-model .",
    "this conversion between surface brightness profile and density profile assumes that the emissivity does not vary with radius . in our 0.4 - 1.25 kev band ,",
    "the emissivity does not change with temperature by more than 10% for temperatures between 0.3 kev and 1 kev .",
    "if the metallicity varies , the emissivity can also change , but for this galaxy the projected metallicity profile is consistent with being flat .",
    "we use a fiducial temperature of 0.4 kev and a fiducial metallicity of 0.2 @xmath17 to convert from surface brightness into density .",
    "next , we convert the results of the spectral fitting into estimates of the emission measure in each region .",
    "this is trivially derived from the normalization of the apec component of the spectrum , using our assumed distance of 58.0 mpc to ngc 1961 .",
    "we rescale the emission measure in each region assuming the fiducial metallicity of 0.2@xmath17 . while we adopted a metallicity of",
    "0.5@xmath17 when performing our spectral fitting , the results of the spectral fits with floating metallicity suggest that a value of 0.2@xmath17 is more reasonable for this galaxy . *",
    "we therefore adopt a fiducial metallicity of 0.2@xmath17 for the remainder of the analysis*. it is simple to scale our results into a different metallicity , however : at the level of accuracy we can measure for this galaxy , a good approximation is that the emission measure is inversely proportional to the value of the metallicity , and the electron density is proportional to the inverse square root of the metallicity .",
    "we treat the spectral fits to the 1 bins and the 2 bins separately , and since the regions overlap we also separate each set into two groups .",
    "we therefore have four independently determined profiles , based on regions r0-r2-r4 , r1-r3 , r012-r345 , and r123-r456 respectively .",
    "as noted in section 4 , we discard the r5-r8 regions since the normalization is so poorly constrained from the spectral fitting in these regions .    finally ,",
    "for each annulus , we subtract the expected emission measure from exterior annuli ( em@xmath18 ) .",
    "we divide the remaining emission measure by the volume of the annulus , scaled by the fraction of the field of the annulus covered by the fiducial spectrum ( using the area @xmath19 listed in table 2 ) .",
    "we also include a factor of 0.83 to convert from @xmath20 into @xmath21 assuming a standard helium abundance .",
    "putting this all together , and using a distance of 58.0 mpc and angles in units of arcminutes , the expression for the average electron density is ( see also @xcite , who derives a more general form of this equation ) :    @xmath22    these values are listed in the final column of table 2 , and displayed graphically in figure 8 .",
    "the systematic errors seem to be larger than the 1@xmath11 statistical uncertainties , but together they are still only at about the 10% level .",
    "the uncertain metallicity is by far the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "we also note that in the inner three regions , deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium may be expected due to the presence of the galactic disk .",
    "there is some evidence for this in the preference for 2-temperature fits to these spectra , but the underlying hot halo component remains dominant in these regions , and there is no evidence of the disk in the x - ray image ( figure 5 ) .    in figure 8",
    "we also plot the best - fit hot halo electron density profile for this galaxy , as measured by b13 .",
    "they used the modified @xmath16-model profile of @xcite to parameterize the surface brightness profile , and assumed a constant metallicity of @xmath23 ( relative to the abundance tables of @xcite ) .",
    "we also compute a `` corrected '' version of their density profile , which is multiplied by a factor of 0.64 to account for the different metallicity and the different abundance table relative to our analysis .",
    "overall the agreement is very good between our deprojected profile and their corrected best - fit profile .",
    "the behavior of the profile at larger radii is extremely important , however , and it is not clear whether their parameterization can be extended to larger radii . improved observations are necessary in order to understand the behavior of the hot gaseous halo within a larger fraction of the virial radius .",
    "we can estimate an electron pressure profile for the hot gas , which is the product of the electron density and the temperature .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a deprojected temperature profile , and the hot gas component of the spectra is subdominant beyond a projected radius of 2 arcminutes , so we can not get robust results by subtracting scaled spectra from one another and fitting the remainders , as one can do for deprojection in the high s / n regime .",
    "however , our projected temperature profiles do not show significant gradients , and we can produce an approximate estimate for the reprojected pressure profile by multiplying the reprojected density profile by the projected temperature profile .",
    "we propagate the uncertainties on the temperature and the density into the total uncertainty , and neglect the additional uncertainty introduced by using a projected temperature profile instead of a deprojected temperature profile ( this should be smaller than the statistical uncertainties on the temperature , however ) .",
    "the resulting profile is shown in figure 9 .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    now that we have deprojected electron density and electron pressure profiles , we can estimate the total mass profile of the galaxy .",
    "this is derived from the temperature , electron density , and the gradient of the total pressure at each radius .",
    "we assume @xmath24 and we assume the total pressure is 1.91 times the electron pressure .",
    "this factor is appropriate for solar metallicity gas with the @xcite abundances , but does not vary by more than 1% for other reasonable abundances .",
    "we neglect magnetic support or other forms of non - thermal pressure .",
    "we interpolate between the points in our pressure and density profiles in order to calculate the gradient , and extrapolate to larger and smaller radii based on the distance - weighted slope of the nearest data points ( for more details , see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "the effective circular velocity corresponding to this derived mass profile is shown in figure 10 .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot a number of other constraints on the circular velocity profile of this galaxy .",
    "@xcite measured the hi circular velocity out to 43 kpc , with independent measurements for the receding and approaching sides of the disk .",
    "they measure an inclination angle of @xmath25 ( close to the @xmath26 listed in hyperleda ) which they use to correct their measurements .",
    "the approaching side of the disk decreases towards zero velocity near the center , but the receding side of the disk shows a roughly flat curve towards the center . at smaller radii , co",
    "1 - 0 measurements are also available from @xcite , which are more consistent with the behavior of the receding side of the disk when corrected using @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite make an argument for a higher inclination angle , however , using @xmath28 as a rough value which we adopt here for comparison .",
    "this value would reduce the inclination correction and the inferred total mass for the galaxy .",
    "applying this inclination correction seems to introduce some tension between the cold gas measurements and our x - ray measurements , however .",
    "we consider a third mass estimate using the k - band image to derive the stellar contribution to the potential .",
    "this yields a lower limit to the total circular velocity .",
    "we extract the stellar profile from the k - band image using ellipses for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but the results are nearly identical in both cases so we only plot the former for simplicity .    using the assumed m / l ratio of 0.6 from section 1 , which is roughly the expectation based on @xcite and @xcite for this galaxy , we see that the stars contribute the majority of the mass in the central region of the galaxy , and are also in tension with the gas - dynamical measurements corrected assuming @xmath28 . if we instead consider the @xcite m / l ratio , the tension increases further .",
    "the @xcite inclination angle gives results which seem consistent among gas - dynamical measurements , x - ray measurements , and the stars .",
    "in the regimes where each curve is reliable , the agreement between the rotation curves is good , and points to a roughly flat rotation curve within at least 42 kpc .     or @xmath28 , as indicated .",

    "the line is shaded thick over the region where the rotation curve is constrained by data , and dotted where the curve is extrapolated .",
    "the blue lines show the approximate contribution of the stars in ngc 1961 , based on the k - band image assuming either a chabrier ( solid line ) or salpeter ( dashed line ) imf . in general the @xmath27 model seems to be preferred by the x - ray data , and the rotation curve seems to be roughly flat within at least 42 kpc.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    finally , in figure 11 we plot the enclosed stellar mass , hot gas mass , and total mass for ngc 1961 .",
    "we use the aforementioned m / l ratio of 0.6 for the stars , so that the total stellar mass is about @xmath6 .",
    "the rotation curves only extend to about 42 kpc , so we extrapolate the total mass profile to larger radii .",
    "we assume that the dark matter approaches an nfw profile at larger radii @xcite , such that the virial mass of this galaxy is @xmath29 , extending to a virial radius of about 490 kpc .",
    "this agrees well with the estimate of b13 , who estimated a virial radius of 470 kpc for this galaxy based on comparison with cosmological simulations .",
    "still , it is a very crude estimate of the total mass , and we will therefore not use the extrapolated mass for any precise calculations .    within 10 kpc , the stellar component seems to be dominant , but at larger radii the system quickly becomes dominated by dark matter . within 90 kpc , the hot halo contains less than a tenth of the mass in the stars . at this radius , the baryon fraction ( mass in stars + neutral hydrogen + hot halo ) is close to the cosmic fraction .",
    "extrapolating to larger radii , the hot halo may become comparable to the mass of the stars , but the sum of these components is less than a third of the expected baryon content for the system .",
    "this is an illustration of the problem of missing baryons from galaxies ( see section 6.1 ) .",

    "each line is styled in boldface over the regime where the mass is measured , and dotted where the profile is extrapolated . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    our measured electron pressure profile is also useful for predicting the thermal sz signal from this galaxy .",
    "the thermal sz effect is proportional to the volume integral of the electron pressure , which we express using the compton @xmath30-parameter .",

    "if we extrapolate our pressure profile out to this radius , the integrated @xmath30 parameter increases to @xmath37 arcmin@xmath32 .",
    "these values are below the sensitivity limits of planck sz catalogs for an object of this angular size ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the projected location of ngc 1961 is fairly close to the galactic disk , which is a more difficult location in the sky to isolate the sz signal .    we can also compare this value to the stacking measurements of @xcite . for galaxies with log @xmath38 ,",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath39 arcmin@xmath32 , where the tilde indicates that the value has been normalized to an angular distance of 500 mpc . using the distance of 58 mpc appropriate for ngc 1961 yields @xmath40 arcmin@xmath32 .",
    "this is about 300 times larger than our estimated @xmath41 for this galaxy .",
    "based on the planck selection function data , for a galaxy with the angular size of ngc 1961 , the planck map should be sensitive to such a signal at 5@xmath11 or higher with around 90% completeness , so the non - detection of this galaxy suggests it does not have the mean thermal sz signal for a galaxy of its stellar mass . on the other hand , based on the halo mass of ngc 1961 , @xcite predicts @xmath41 of just @xmath42 arcmin@xmath32 , which is undetectable in the planck map .",
    "while this is only one galaxy , so it is difficult to draw strong conclusions , the implication is that halo mass is a better predictor of the sz signal than the stellar mass , a point to which we return in section 6.2 .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath41 for a galaxy with the halo mass of ncg 1961 from @xcite is still an order of magnitude above our predicted @xmath41 value ( which admittedly involves an extrapolation of nearly an order of magnitude in radius beyond our outermost spectral bin ) .",
    "more work needs to be done in order to understand this discrepancy .",
    "we can also construct the entropy profile for the hot halo of ngc 1961 .",
    "this is given by @xmath43 , and propagates uncertainties on both @xmath44 and @xmath45 just like the pressure profile ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the entropy profile is shown in figure 12 .        within the uncertainties ,",
    "the entropy profile is positive in agreement with the schwarzschild stability criterion .",
    "the central value is about 30 kev @xmath46 , which is the transition value noted by @xcite for brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "bcgs below this value typically have bright h@xmath47 emission and star formation , and generally correspond to cool - core systems @xcite , while higher entropy values indicate that the gas is able to stratify before cooling instabilities grow ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the low entropy in the core of ngc 1961 therefore leads one to expect similar behavior for this galaxy .",
    "indeed , 21 cm hi observations of this galaxy @xcite show widespread , patchy hi emission around this galaxy , extending tens of kpc to the nw .",
    "this extended hi emission has a low velocity dispersion ( of order 20 km / s ) and appears to be co - rotating with , and accreting onto , the disk ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "this extended hi appears to contain about 10% of the total neutral hydrogen content of the system , or about @xmath48 of neutral gas . in order to check",
    "if this neutral gas can be explained by condensation from the hot halo , we compute the cooling time and the dynamical time as a function of radius . the cooling time is given by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total particle density , and we assume @xmath51 as in section 5.1 .",
    "the dynamical time is given by    @xmath52    at every radius where we have data , the cooling time is about two orders of magnitude higher than the dynamical time , which is an order of magnitude away from the threshold value predicted from simulations for cooling instabilities to become important . at 40 kpc , for example , the cooling time is 13 gyr and the dynamical time is 160 myr .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that condensation from the hot halo is the source of most of the neutral hydrogen seen around ngc 1961 .",
    "another possibility , proposed by @xcite is that the hi is the result of ram pressure stripping .",
    "ngc 1961 lies several hundred kpc to the nw of a poor group of galaxies , and the hi appears extended in the direction away from the center of this group , so it appeared plausible that ngc 1961 could be falling into this group and losing its ism through interactions with a hot intragroup medium .",
    "however , the x - ray halo of ngc 1961 shows no signs of such interactions , and there is also no x - ray emission associated with a larger intragroup medium in figure 5 .",
    "a rosat analysis by @xcite also found no sign of an intragroup medium emitting in the x - ray band .",
    "we think the extended hi feature is more likely to be a sign of accretion from the intergalactic medium .",
    "this would explain its filamentary appearance , and it seems logical that an unusually massive spiral galaxy would require an unusually large supply of intergalactic gas .",
    "moreover , the velocity field of the hi stream appears identical to the velocity field of the hi disk ( see @xcite figure 6 ) , which was also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "alignment of the angular momentum of the accreting gas and the galactic disk is the natural expectation for accretion from the igm @xcite .",
    "such alignment is less likely for a minor merger , so we think accretion is a better explanation than a merger for this galaxy , but a merger or accretion of a satellite galaxy is also a possibility .",
    "it is interesting that , although the entropy profile looks like a classic cool - core system , the temperature of the hot gas actually increases in the center by factor of 50% . while cool cores are typical in galaxy groups and clusters , negative gradients are common for galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although x - ray faint ellipticals can show flat or positive gradients as well @xcite .",
    "ngc 1961 is an isolated galaxy with the mass of a galaxy group , but it seems that the halo mass is not the determinant of the shape of the temperature profile for this system .",
    "we speculate that feedback from the galaxy itself ( either stellar feedback or a previous episode of agn feedback ) may be responsible for heating the gas within the central few tens of kpc in this system .",
    "in this section we return to one of the questions discussed in the introduction : where are the missing baryons from ngc 1961 ? the deep observations in this study",
    "allow us to constrain the density profile of the hot halo out to about 42 kpc , which is about 9% of the virial radius , and it is notable that we see no evidence for any `` flattening '' in the density profile over this range .",
    "it is still difficult to rule out a putative flat component at larger radii , however .",
    "as figure 7 shows , the spectral and spatial techniques begin to disagree at radii larger than about 50 kpc , where the hot gas surface brightness is below about 10% of the total soft - band surface brightness .",
    "we are unlikely to improve upon this limit ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) with the current generation of instrumentation . in figure 7",
    "we also show the predicted surface brightness from a uniform density cloud of gas with kt = 0.5 kev , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 extending out to the virial radius .",
    "this is the flattest possible density profile that contains the entire baryonic content of the system .",
    "unfortunately this limiting case falls below our surface brightness sensitivity , and so we can not confirm or rule out the possibility of some sort of extremely flat halo becoming important at larger radii .",
    "it is also important to emphasize the uncertainties in this discussion .",
    "we can detect the hot halo to nearly 20% of the virial radius from our surface brightness analysis , and measure the density to about 10% of the virial radius with good accuracy , but the vast majority of the virial volume is unconstrained and depends on power - law extrapolations .",
    "moreover , the total mass of ngc 1961 is also not well - constrained , since it also depends on similar extrapolations to the observed rotation curves . finally , since we find the stars have a similar mass as the hot halo for this galaxy , the m / l ratio of the stars is also somewhat important .",
    "our estimates of each of these quantities are unlikely to be wrong by a factor of 2 or more , so the problem of missing baryons remains for ngc 1961 , but the exact baryon fraction should be considered extremely uncertain",
    ".    our measurements of the pressure in the hot halo can also be useful for understanding the baryon budget of ngc 1961 .",
    "observations with the cos instrument on hst show ultraviolet absorption around l * galaxies from many different elements , generally with a high covering fraction ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization modeling suggests that this absorption comes from ionized clouds , with characteristic temperatures around @xmath55 k , densities of order @xmath56 @xmath57 , and a volume filling fraction around 10% @xcite .",
    "such clouds can not exist in pressure equilibrium with the hot halo around ngc 1961 , but at larger radii ( several hundred kpc ) if the hot halo pressure continues to decline these clouds would be in equilibrium .",
    "if they have densities at the high end of their estimates and a 10% volume filling fraction beyond 150 kpc , such clouds could contain essentially all of the missing baryons from the galaxy .",
    "however , such clouds are unlikely to condense from the hot halo , given the high ratio of the cooling time to the dynamical time .",
    "if they originate from the galaxy , they would therefore have to survive the passage through the inner 100 kpc or more of hot gas .",
    "we measure the x - ray luminosity of the hot halo for this galaxy from the surface brightness profile ( figure 6 ) .",
    "we convert from 0.4 - 1.25 kev counts into 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux assuming an apec model with a fiducial temperature of 0.5 kev and a metallicity of 0.2 @xmath17 , although for reasonable values of @xmath58 and @xmath44 the conversion factor is constant to within 5% .",
    "the hot gas luminosity within 50 projected kpc is @xmath59 erg s@xmath60 .",
    "integrating out further yields a total hot gas luminosity of @xmath61 erg s@xmath60 .",
    "this is slightly higher , but given the much larger uncertainties the difference is not very significant .",
    "uncertainties from @xcite .",
    "the red star is ngc 1961 , using measurements from this work .",
    "we have converted the peak circular velocity from the hi profile into an effective velocity dispersion by dividing by @xmath62 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in figure 13 we compare the 0.5 - 2.0 kev luminosity of ngc 1961 ( within 50 kpc ) to various scaling relations for early - type galaxies .",
    "the left panel shows this galaxy on a plot of @xmath63 versus @xmath64 , comparing against isolated galaxies from @xcite and from @xcite .",
    "ngc 1961 lies below their best - fit relation by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the scatter in these relations is also nearly an order of magnitude , so we caution against drawing strong conclusions from a single object , but this is consistent with the general observation that the x - ray halos of spiral galaxies appear less luminous than elliptical galaxies .",
    "ngc 1961 is much more consistent with relations between @xmath63 and the total matter content . in the right panel of figure 13",
    "we show the comparison between @xmath63 and the velocity dispersion of early - type galaxies from @xcite .",
    "since ngc 1961 is rotationally supported , we place this galaxy in the figure by dividing the peak inclination - corrected circular velocity from the hi gas ( figure 10 ) by @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", ngc 1961 falls squarely within the relation for early - type galaxies .",
    "we can show this in more detail with a detailed comparison between the properties of ngc 1961 and comparable elliptical galaxies ( figure 14 ) . for this comparison",
    "we consider the galaxies ngc 57 , ngc 4455 , and ngc 7796 , studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they examine ic 1531 as well , but this galaxy has an agn with a radio jet , and they can not constrain the hot halo properties very precisely .",
    "these galaxies were selected as massive ellipticals which are not in any known group or cluster and which have no neighbors within 2 b - magnitudes of their own magnitude @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that the well - known elliptical ngc 720 falls near the border of their isolation criteria , but seems to have a higher density of faint galaxies around it than the three galaxies in their sample .",
    "as far as we can tell , ngc 1961 fulfills their isolation criteria as well , although it is less surprising for spiral galaxies to be isolated as compared to ellipticals .",
    "error regions , from osullivan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and osullivan et al .",
    "values for ngc 1961 are shown in black for comparison . , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    within the uncertainties , the mass profiles and the entropy profiles for these four galaxies are all roughly consistent with one another .",
    "ngc 7796 has a slightly lower inferred total mass , so osulivan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) speculate that the hot gas around this galaxy might not be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "there is a wider range of temperatures and abundances between these galaxies ; ngc 1961 lies in the middle of the range of temperatures but has a lower abundance than the elliptical galaxies .",
    "an interpretation of the discrepancy with the @xmath65 relation and the agreement with the @xmath66 relation is that the halo mass governs the x - ray properties of the system , instead of the stellar mass .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , massive blue galaxies generally seem to lie in less massive halos than their red counterparts . as an example of this , from",
    "@xcite we find that the effective halo mass of an average galaxy with the stellar mass of ngc 1961 is around @xmath67 - much higher than the halo mass we measure for ngc 1961 .",
    "the lower halo mass offers a natural explanation for why ngc 1961 appears to scatter so low on the @xmath65 relation when compared to elliptical galaxies in much more massive halos .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the deepest x - ray observation to date of a hot gaseous halo around a spiral galaxy .",
    "ngc 1961 has already been studied with both chandra and xmm - newton , but our deep observations allow us to perform a much more precise and robust analysis . using a spatial analysis similar to @xcite and @xcite , we detect extended soft x - ray emission to very large radii ( at least 80 kpc ) .",
    "no breaks or bright features are evident in the surface brightness profile or the soft x - ray image of the galaxy .",
    "we also perform a spectral analysis on the xmm - newton data .",
    "this allows us to measure the physical properties of the hot gas out to 42 kpc .",
    "we explore eight different sets of spectral models , and the scatter between results from these different models allows us to estimate the systematic uncertainty from the choice of models . in general this is comparable to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the spectral and spatial methods give fully consistent results as well , further underscoring the robustness of our results .",
    "the hot halo has a negative temperature gradient ( declining with radius ) , as is typical for elliptical galaxies of similar mass .",
    "the metallcity of the halo is consistent with being flat at a value around 0.2@xmath17 .",
    "such a low metallicity is not typical for elliptical galaxies of similar mass , which usually have abundances around solar , although x - ray fainter ellipticals can have sub - solar abundances as well . the higher abundances for ellipticals are thought to stem from the mixing of the hot interstellar medium and the hot halo , whereas ngc 1961 can lock up the majority of its metals in the cooler phases of its ism . in support of this picture , we find a statistical preference for a two - temperature medium within the disk of this galaxy , with the dominant component having the high temperature and low abundance characteristic of the hot gaseous halo and a less massive component having a lower temperature and a higher abundance typical of the hot interstellar medium .",
    "we also measure deprojected density profiles for the hot halo out to 42 kpc .",
    "the results are consistent with the parametric fit obtained by b13 , when rescaled to our fiducial metallicity of 0.2@xmath17 , as well as with the much more uncertain profile obtained by @xcite .",
    "no evidence of a break or a flattening in the profile is seen .",
    "extrapolating the profile to the virial radius , we estimate a hot halo mass which is comparable to the stellar mass of the galaxy .    from the density profile and the temperature profile ,",
    "we compute a pressure profile for the hot halo and then we infer a total mass profile under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas . this mass profile is roughly consistent with measurements from the circular velocity profile observed with 21 cm emission .",
    "based on the extrapolated hot gas mass and total mass , the problem of missing baryons from ngc 1961 seems to persist , with an estimated baryon fraction ( hot gas + stars + neutral hydrogen ) around 30% of the cosmic fraction .",
    "it is conceivable that photoionized gas at intermediate temperatures could also exist around this galaxy , as observations by the cos instrument on hst suggest for many smaller galaxies .",
    "this could supply the missing baryons , but there are a few complications .",
    "first , such clouds would be far out of pressure equilibrium with the hot halo out to several hundred kpc .",
    "second , the hot halo appears to be stable against global cooling instabilities over the range we can measure , making it difficult to condense such clouds out of the hot halo .",
    "these are not insurmountable difficulties , but they do complicate the modeling of the circumgalactic medium .    finally , we show that the x - ray luminosity from ngc 1961 is about an order of magnitude fainter than one would expect from the @xmath63-@xmath64 relation for elliptical galaxies . on the other hand , this galaxy seems to have exactly the right @xmath63 for its dark matter mass , suggesting the dark matter halo governs the hot halo more fundamentally than the galaxy at the center .",
    "the non - detection of this galaxy in the planck sz map also supports this conclusion , as an elliptical galaxy with the same stellar mass and distance is very likely to have been detected .",
    "a number of open issues remain .",
    "it is critically important to push measurements out to larger radii , which will require deeper x - ray observations , possibly combined with an sz and/or absorption - line analysis ( the latter two are more sensitive at larger radii than x - ray emission , which depends on the square of the gas density ) .",
    "it is also important to increase the sample size of hot gaseous halos , in order to understand better how the properties of the gaseous halo connect with the properties of the galaxy and of the dark matter halo .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with mark burke , massimo gaspari , rishi khatri , alex kolodzig , and stefano mineo related to this work , and to thank the referee for a thoughtful report that improved the paper . based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
