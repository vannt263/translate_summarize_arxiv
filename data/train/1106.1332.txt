    "the nature of magnetism in the recently discovered iron pnictides superconductors @xcite is an intensively studied topic , due to its possible coexistence with superconductivity and relation to the pairing mechanism @xcite . in the so - called `` 122 family '' , the parent compounds afe@xmath3as@xmath3 , where a = ba , ca , sr or eu , present a transition to a spin density wave ( sdw ) phase which is commensurate with the lattice spacing .",
    "when substituting fe with another metal , like co or ni ( the dopant ) , the nel temperature gradually decreases and superconductivity eventually emerges at higher dopant concentrations . in ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 , superconductivity and magnetism coexist locally below the critical temperature @xmath6 @xcite , i.e. there occurs a so - called mixed phase with spatial coexistence of the two phases . by contrast , in some pnictides belonging to another family , e.g. lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 @xcite , magnetism vanishes when superconductivity sets in .",
    "magnetic order in all afe@xmath3as@xmath3 is antiferromagnetic ( af ) and the spin arrangement is formed by af stripes along @xmath7 and ferromagnetic stripes along @xmath8 , in the orthorhombic notation @xcite .",
    "the fe ordered moment is small , of the order of 1@xmath9 , which , together with the metallic behavior in the normal state , suggests the presence of itinerant magnetism .",
    "this is believed to be induced by a fermi surface instability driven by the nesting between an electron and a hole pocket @xcite , as seen by angle - resolved photoemission studies ( arpes ) in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite , as well as in electron - doped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite and hole - doped ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite .    in doped systems , it was suggested that an imperfect nesting between the hole and electron pockets should lead to the formation of an incommensurate spin density wave ( ic - sdw ) below the magnetic transition temperature @xcite , as occurs in cr @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies have shown that coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is favoured by the presence of an ic - sdw @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of an ic - sdw is an important issue to verify the various theories put forward in order to describe the physics of pnictide superconductors .",
    "experimentally , a phase transition from commensurate to incommensurate sdw was recently reported in srfe@xmath3as@xmath3 under pressure @xcite , based on nmr measurements . in ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 ,",
    "the presence of an ic - sdw was inferred from local techniques such as nmr @xcite , mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite and @xmath10sr @xcite , but was not observed by neutron scattering @xcite until recently , and only in a narrow concentration range close to a co doping level @xmath11=0.055 @xcite .",

    "we interpret the mssbauer data using the two models for an incommensurate spin density wave and for a dopant - induced fe moment perturbation .",
    "then , we present simulations of nmr spectra from refs.@xcite assuming an ic - sdw modulation with the parameters obtained from the fit of the mssbauer spectra .",

    "the system is not superconducting at @xmath4 , while at @xmath14 superconductivity occurs below @xmath15k .",
    "susceptibility measurements on a single crystal show that the whole sample is superconducting below @xmath6 .",
    "resistivity measurements performed on crystals from the same batches showed them to be very homogenous @xcite , with a magnetic transition towards a spin density wave at @xmath16k for @xmath4 and @xmath17k for @xmath14 .",

    "spectra are well fitted to a 6-line pattern due to a single hyperfine field of 5.4 t at 4.2k .",
    "this is expected for a commensurate magnetic order and it is in good agreement with similar measurements presented in refs.@xcite , as well as with neutron scattering @xcite and nmr @xcite results .",
    "a peculiarity of these hyperfine field spectra is that the hwhm of the middle lines , 0.134(4)mm / s , is equal within uncertainties to that of the inner lines , while the hwhm of the outer lines is 0.168(4)mm / s , significantly larger .",
    "this unusual spectral effect is observed in other published spectra at 4.2k @xcite and it can not be due to a mere distribution of hyperfine fields , which would yield increasing broadenings for the inner , middle and outer lines .",
    "it can be accounted for by correlated distributions of quadrupolar interaction ( qi ) and isomer shift ( is ) .",
    "the presence of a qi distribution at the @xmath0fe site is in line with the @xmath5as nmr spectra in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , which indicate a sizeable distribution of quadrupolar frequencies at the as site @xcite .",

    "one can wonder whether ic - sdw could be present at all concentrations in the low doping regime of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)as@xmath3 , because the direction of the propagation vector of the modulation could change with @xmath11 , following variations in the fermi surface nesting . this would further complicate the detection of ic - sdw by neutron scattering and resonant x - ray measurements .    while disorder due to substitutions is inherent in ba(fe@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 and ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 , there are a few stoichiometric systems in which the signature of incommensurability was observed and the presence of disorder can be ruled out . in the `` 122 family '' , the stoichiometric system srfe@xmath3as@xmath3 presents , under pressure , a crossover versus temperature from commensurate to incommensurate af , seen by @xmath5as nmr measurements @xcite . in nafeas ,",
    "a similar crossover was evidenced at ambient pressure by @xmath92na and @xmath5as nmr @xcite .",
    "this system presents filamentary superconductivity below 23k and , similar to other fe - based pnictides , shows a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic at 50k , followed by a magnetic one towards an antiferromagnetically ordered state at 40k .",
    "these observations suggests that incommensurability is not only related to doping but rather , might be connected to subtle changes of the fermi surface . in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that at very low doping levels , both ic - sdw and dopant - induced perturbation models fit the nmr and mssbauer spectra well in ba(fe@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "however , the latter model collapses even for moderate dopant concentrations @xmath14 , because it overestimates the disorder effect .",
    "further theoretical calculations are required in order to sort out the precise influence of the dopant on the magnetic properties of pnictides . on the other hand ,",
    "the ic - sdw model successfully reproduces the spectra over the whole doping region .",
    "this , together with the observation of ic - sdw in the stoichiometric systems mentioned above and the similarity with the co family , suggests that ic - sdw might also be present in the ni family .",
