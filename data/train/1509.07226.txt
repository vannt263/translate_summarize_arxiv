    ", the flare energy is transferred from the magnetic energy .",
    "magnetic reconnection is thought to be the primary energy release mechanism that heats the plasmas and accelerates the bi - directional nonthermal electrons in the solar atmosphere .",
    "this is known as the cshkp model @xcite .",
    "these nonthermal electrons which guided by the reconnected magnetic field lines , not only travel to the interplanetary space but also precipitate into the lower corona and upper chromosphere , where they lose energy to produce radiation through coulomb collisions with the denser medium .",
    "this has been known as the ` thick - target ' model for the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission @xcite .",
    "observations show that only a small fraction of the energy is lost through extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the energy heats the local chromospheric material rapidly up to a typical temperature of @xmath010 mk .",
    "then the resulting overpressure can drive the mass flow upward along the loop at speeds of a few hundreds kilometers per second .",

    "previous observations reveal that hxr emission tends to rise with the double footpoint sources along the flaring loop legs , eventually merging them into a single source at the same position of the loop - top source @xcite .",
    "this is because the dense materials from the chromosphere rise upward along the loops , following the movement of the hxr emission targets .",
    "the flare shows the mergence speed of around 200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "such large value of the mass evaporation is clearly demonstrated by the blue shifts at the euv spectral observations of the coronal lines @xcite .",
    "spectral images exhibit that the blue shifts tend to appear at the outsides of the flare ribbons @xcite .",
    "evaporation materials with high temperature rise upward to disturb the coronal plasma , which results into the radio emission suddenly suppressed on the radio dynamic spectra , especially at the decimeter range . a high - frequency cutoff drifting to lower frequency",
    "is thought to be the signature of chromospheric evaporation @xcite    from the observations , there are two types of chromospheric evaporation .",
    "evaporation is said to proceed ` gently ' when the chromosphere plasmas lose energy via a combination of radiation and low - velocity hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "emission lines formed at temperature characteristic of the atmosphere from chromosphere through transition region to corona all appear blue shifted @xcite .",
    "evaporation is regarded to proceed ` explosively ' when the chromosphere is unable to radiate energy at a sufficient rate and consequently expands at high velocities into the overlying flare loops .",
    "the overpressure of evaporated material also drives low - velocity downward motion into the underlying chromosphere , in a process known as ` chromospheric condensation ' @xcite . in this case ,",
    "emission lines formed at temperature characteristic of the upper chromosphere and transition region all appear red shifted , while hotter lines from the corona appear blue shifted @xcite .",
    "spectral observations show the red shifted velocity of @xmath020 to 40 km s@xmath2 , which is an order smaller than the blue shifted value ( @xmath0200 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this is because the plasma density of the underlying lower chromosphere is much higher than that of the overlying corona .    up to now , there are two viewpoints about how to drive the evaporation in the literatures .",
    "one is the electron - driven , while another is the thermal conduction driven .",
    "the former emphases that the non - thermal energy of nonthermal electrons play an important role in the evaporation @xcite , while the latter focuses on the thermal energy directly driven @xcite . in this paper , using the observations from _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) , _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _",

    "the hxr emission at 25@xmath750 kev starts an intensity as small as about 20 counts s@xmath2 , then becomes more than one order bigger after the maximum .",
    "that results into a single point at about 20 counts s@xmath2 of hxr emission in fig .",
    "[ scatter1 ] ( c , d ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient will become larger if this point is omitted .",
    "[ scatter2 ] plots the two hxr peaks at higher energy channels ( such as 50.9@xmath7102.3 kev , and 102.3@xmath7296.4 kev ) dependence on fe and c doppler velocities for the 2014 september 10 flare .",
    "the similar anti - correlation between hxr emissions and coronal line ( fe ) doppler shifts , while correlation between hxr emissions and chromospheric line ( c ) doppler shifts are found during the same interval .",
    "the higher correlation coefficients ( @xmath13 0.85 ) further confirm our results .",
    "using _ iris _ spectral observations on the flare ribbon and hxr observations from _ fermi _ or _ rhessi _ , we investigate the relationship between hxr emissions and doppler velocities during the explosive evaporations in two x - class solar flares on 2014 september 10 and october 22 . using the multi - gaussian fitting , doppler velocities of fe and c",
    "are detected from _ iris _ spectral observations . at certain position on",
    "the slit , fe and c display their doppler velocities with a ` increase - peak - decrease ' pattern , which is well related to the ` rising - maximum - decay ' phase of hxr emissions .",
    "consistent with previous findings @xcite , we find a high anti - correlation between hxr emissions and coronal line doppler shifts of fe , and a high correlation between hxr emissions and chromospheric line doppler shifts of c , indicating the electron beam - driven explosive evaporation in these two solar flares .",
    "the similar results are also found in the recent paper by @xcite , who get a high correlation between fe blue shifts and derivative of _ goes _ sxr for the 2014 september 6 and 10 flares .    as noted earlier , fig .",
    "[ light ] plots the fe and c doppler velocities at two distinct positions respectively , which results into a good correlation with hxr peaks simultaneously .",
    "the peak time of doppler velocities would be changed for various positions on the slit .",
    "in other words , doppler velocities on the other positions are not well correlated with the hxr peaks at the same intervals .",
    "however , the time profiles of doppler velocities at any positions exhibit the similar shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ light ] .",
    "we can still obtain the high correlations between doppler velocities and hxr peaks after shifting an interval of doppler velocity peaks .",
    "these intervals are different for the various positions along the slit , and it is an open question that a temporal correlation does not exist at these positions along the slit . fig .",
    "[ light ] just gives the doppler velocities at two special positions on the slit .",
    "they do nt need to shift with time to do the correlation in figs .",
    "[ scatter1 ] and  [ scatter2 ] .",
    "for example , the first peak of the purple curve in fig .",
    "[ light ] ( e ) is at 17:29 ut , and it could be correspond well with the peak ` 2 ' in _ fermi _ data if it is shifted an interval of about 1 minutes . while the second peak at 17:33 ut are corresponding well with the hxr peak ` 3 ' without shifting .",
    "@xcite reported a time delay ( @xmath00.5@xmath72.0 minutes ) for the larger correlation between the fe blue shifts and sxr derivative on 2014 september 10 flare .",
    "this delay should be caused by the spectral profiles at different positions along the _ iris _ slit .",
    "when the flare ribbon propagates toward the south - west and expands with time , the peak of fe blue shifts changes with the slit positions , as well as with the time ( seen in figs .",
    "[ ribbon ] and [ vel1 ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we fit all the spectra along the _ iris _ slit at all time to obtain the space - time images of doppler velocities , and get the time evolution of doppler velocities at any positions on the slit . on the other hand , both fe and c exhibit red shifts on the flare decay phase , especially for the 2014 september 10 flare . as the cross ( ` @xmath8 ' ) marked in fig  [ light ] ( c , e ) , fe has a velocity of @xmath024 km s@xmath2 , while c has a small peak . the spectral profile at this time is given in fig .  [ fit2 ] ( b ) , which shows strong emissions at fe and c .",
    "at this position , fe and c have line centers of about 1354.19 and 1354.40  , line widths of 524.33 m and 76.96 m . they show red shifts from their rest wavelengths .",
    "these red shifts of fe and c could be caused by the material falling down or the loop contracting at the decay phase of the flares .",
    "the rest wavelength of chromospheric line c is set as 1354.29  , which is detected from the quiet sun ( seen in fig .",
    "[ fit2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with recent studies from _ iris _ observations @xcite .",
    "however , as noted earlier , fe is a hot coronal line , which is absent on the quiet sun .",
    "therefore , we can not determine the rest wavelength of fe from non - flaring spectrum .",
    "there are different line centers of fe in the literatures .",
    "the first value of 1354.1  for fe has been identified from the spectra of solar flares by @xcite .",
    "then the rest wavelength of fe is though between 1354.06  and 1354.12  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , the rest wavelength of fe",
    "is set to 1354.09  , and this value is similar as that in recent studies @xcite about fe from _ iris _ spectral data . considering the broad range of fe ,",
    "the rest wavelength has an uncertainty of about @xmath30.03  , corresponding the doppler velocity of about @xmath36.6 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the rest wavelength of fe is probably taken from the decay phase of the flare due to it s stable emission , as the example of the 2014 september 10 flare . however , the wavelength value is @xmath01354.19  ( i.e. , the cross ( ` @xmath8 ' ) in fig .  [ light ] ( c , d ) ) at the decay phase of this flare , which is much bigger than the rest wavelength in previous studies .",
    "it is a fact that the coronal line of fe is absent in the non - flare regions where the temperature is not hot enough .",
    "therefore , the intensities and doppler velocities of fe in figs .",
    "[ vel1 ] ( a , b ) and [ vel2 ] ( a , b ) outside the flare regions are invalid , they are fitting noises from the observation data .",
    "same as the chromospheric line of c , its doppler velocities ( figs .",
    "[ vel1 ] ( d ) and [ vel2 ] ( d ) ) outside the flare regions should also be fitting noises from the observation data .",
    "the multi - gaussian fitting is used to determine the doppler velocities of fe and c in this paper .",
    "there are three sources of uncertainties to their doppler shifts .",
    "firstly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ light ] , the fitting errors are very large in the non - flare regions and become much less in the flare regions , no matter fe or c .",
    "this error is mathematic from the fitting method .",
    "secondly , the red wing enhancement or redshifted component of the cool lines ( i.e. , fe , si , and c ) could affect the identification of fe @xcite .",
    "there is no way to exactly rule out these blending lines from fe at present time .",
    "using tied intensities , line centers and widths could be a better approach as normally lines from the same ion or similar lines should have similar behaviors .",
    "therefore , we constrained and tied these lines with the emission lines in other windows ( seen in table  [ table ] ) to eliminate the influence of these cool lines .",
    "thirdly , the asymmetries of c line should also affect the derived red shift of c . because the gaussian fitting of such asymmetrical lines tends to underestimate the velocity of chromospheric condensation , especially for the optically thick lines , i.e. , mg line @xcite , and h@xmath14 line @xcite .",
    "a good way to determine the doppler shifts from the asymmetric line is the bisector method ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could accurately determine the doppler shift , i.e. , especially the red shift for the asymmetrical c in our case .",
    "however , not the bisector , but the gaussian fitting is used in this paper . because c is one of the multi - gaussian fitting in our code , while the bisector method is a better way for the isolated line .    in this paper",
    ", we find the blue shifts of fe quickly increases from zero to the maximum ( more than 200 km s@xmath2 ) before decreasing , which is different from @xcite finding that the evaporation speed shows a monotonic decrease once appearing at the flare ribbon",
    ". this would be because we take the whole history of the fe doppler velocities during the impulsive phase of the flare , while @xcite only show the doppler velocities after its maximum .",
    "on the other hand , their data is in ` raster ' mode , rather than ` sit and stare ' mode .",
    "the time resolution is not high .",
    "the 2014 october 22 flare in this paper is in ` raster ' mode , and has a lower time resolution than the 2014 september 10 flare .",
    "but we can also detect the doppler velocity increase before its maximum . the flare on 2014",
    "september 10 is also studied by @xcite .",
    "both of them found very clearly monotonic decrease of the fe blue shifts , but no increase before the peak , as shown in fig .",
    "13 in @xcite .",
    "they also found the evaporation within about 9 minutes , from 17:32 ut to 17:41 ut , which is similar to our finding of @xmath010 minutes evaporation .",
    "from the orange curves in fig .  [ light ] ( c ) , the start time of evaporation is about 17:26 ut ( velocity above 3@xmath10 ) , and the end time is about 17:36 ut ( velocity equally to zero ) , while the peak time is about 17:28 ut .",
    "@xcite showed the monotonic decrease of fe blue shifts for the 2014 september 10 flare after the maximum at 17:32 ut .",
    "their velocity curve is at position around 117.8on the slit .",
    "however , we give all the histories of the flare at the position of @xmath064.7along the slit in fig .",
    "[ light ] ( c ) , i.e. , from the flare onset at 17:21 ut . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found the same evaporation pattern of ` increase - peak - decrease ' for 2014 september 6 flare when their fitting results cover the whole histories of the flare .",
    "in fact , previous studies had been reported the similar evolution of doppler velocities from hot coronal lines ( i.e. , fe , fe , fe , and so on ) in the solar flares , such as the evolution of ` increase - peak - decrease ' pattern ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ light ] ( e ) also shows that the chromospheric c line seems to display several small peaks after its maximum .",
    "they could be related to the hxr emissions at the decay phase or the materials with various speeds falling back to chromosphere .",
    "meanwhile , they probably are the spectral signatures of the various loop contracting .",
