    "following the unification scheme the central nucleus of an active galaxy ( agn ) consists of a black hole ( bh ) , an accretion disk , line - emitting clouds , a dust torus , and emanates prominent jets when classified as radio - loud .",
    "the properties of radio - loud agn viewed at a small angle to the line - of - sight are in general agreement with the common blazar properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their broadband emission covers the complete electromagnetic band , from the radio up to the @xmath0-ray band , in some cases even reaching tev - energies , and is widely dominated by beamed non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "the blazar class subdivides into bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "the difference dividing both subclasses is generally considered in the detection of strong emission lines in the case of fsrqs , while in bl lac objects the equivalent width of emission lines is depressed , or lines are absent at all .",
    "the physical reason is thought to lie predominantly in the weak accretion disk radiation field of bl lac objects , whereas bh in the nuclei of fsrqs accrete with high rates leading to luminous accretion disk photon fields .",
    "the present work deals with @xmath0-ray loud agn observed during an epoche of a bright accretion disk and accompagnied with the apprearance of strong emission lines .",
    "for simplicity i will refer to them as  quasars  in the following , although some radio - loud agn classified conventionally as bl lac objects may occasionally fall into this category as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and vice versa .",
    "gamma - ray production mechanisms , leptonic as well as hadronic ones , in agn jets often involve either the external radiation fields associated with the immediate agn environment or internal jet photons .",
    "for example , contributions from interactions in the accretion disk or broad - line region ( blr ) radiation fields are often mandatory to explain the overall @xmath0-ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from fsrqs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the sed of low - luminosity bl lac objects is often fitted with either  synchrotron - self - compton  models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the former scenario places the @xmath0-ray emission region rather close to the blr clouds .",
    "this has immediate consequences : if external radiation fields in quasar environments play a non - negligible role for @xmath0-ray production , then , at the same time they are also significant for the quasi - resonant process of photon - photon pair production with its peak cross section possessing a comparable value to the thomson cross section .",
    "it should be noted though , that the position of the high - energy emission region is still a matter of debate , with locations proposed to be also far away from the blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , external compton emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or pair cascade radiation initiated by ultra - high energy cosmic ray interactions on external photon fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in those sources does not provide an appreciable contribution to the observed high - energy emission .",
    "the present work concerns specifically opacity features in the @xmath1 gev regime by photon absorption through e@xmath2-e@xmath3 pair production in radiation fields in the vicinity of the bh , but external to the jets in @xmath0-ray loud quasars .",
    "past works on this subject ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate the importance of this process for constraining agn properties like the location of the @xmath0-ray region above the disk , disk radiation fields , torus temperature , etc .",
    "in contrast to these works , i will be focusing on the evolution of external radiation fields in quasar environments , and its consequences for the resulting opacity features in the @xmath0-ray band covered by current and near future instruments .",
    "this is primarily motivated by the anticipated studies of the evolution of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) through the detection of absorption features in a large sample of high - redshift sources using the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard glast .",
    "dedicated methods have been developed here to probe the evolution of the ebl via detecting the horizon of @xmath0-rays emitted from extragalactic sources like agn and grbs while propagating through the ebl to earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they involve either the determination of the ratio of absorbed to unabsorbed flux versus redshift @xmath4 , or the detection of the e - folding cutoff energy @xmath5 versus redshift (  fazio - stecker relation  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a large number of sources at various redshifts in order to disentangle intrinsic blazar features from absorption caused ones during propagation in the ebl .",
    "the common underlying reasoning for this procedure is that the observation of any redshift - dependent attenuation in @xmath0-ray agn can only be attributed to absorption in the ebl , and no other sources of redshift - dependent opacity exist in those sources . here",
    "i will demonstrate that opacity due to photon absorption from @xmath6-pair production caused in external radiation fields within the agn system ( in the following called  local absorption ",
    ", to be distinguished from `` self - absorption '' in the internal jet radiation fields ) will most likely result in optical depth values that increase with the source redshift , and coincidentally mimic redshift - dependent ebl - caused absorption .",

    "i will apply various models of supermassive bh growth and accretion rate evolution , that are described in sect .  4 , to the @xmath0-ray attenuation calculations .",
    "the results with particular emphasis on the possibility of a redshift - dependence of the local opacity are presented in sect .",
    "the paper closes with conclusions and a discussion in sect .",
    "the most relevant target radiation fields in agn environments for photon absorption in the lat energy range , @xmath70.02 - 300 gev , are the optical / uv bands of the accretion disk photon field and the radiation field of the blr .",

    "a fraction @xmath34 of the central source luminosity @xmath35 is re - processed into line radiation such that the total blr luminosity , assumed to be optically thin , is @xmath36 , and these lines are assumed to radiate isotropically .",
