    "in the standard paradigm the primary luminosity of an agn originates in an accretion disc around a super - massive black hole . in the x - ray band ,",
    "a hard power - law component generally dominates above @xmath12  kev in the well - studied seyfert  1 galaxies and is believed to arise in a hot corona above the surface of the accretion disc , where optical / uv photons from the disc are comptonised to x - ray energies . these x - rays in turn illuminate the disc , being either ` reflected ' towards the observer or thermalised back into optical / uv emission ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the x - ray spectral band , evidence for this disc reflection component may be seen in the form of a broad fluorescent fe k@xmath2 line near 6.4  kev , an fe k edge at @xmath3  kev and a compton ` hump ' at @xmath4  kev .",
    "all these features have been observed in bright seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. pounds et al .",

    "the improved resolution of _ asca _  showed the fe k@xmath2 line was often broad with excess flux , particularly in a ` red ' wing to the line , explained by emission from the inner disc in a region of both high velocities and high gravity ( tanaka et al .",

    "1997a ) .",
    "the substantial gains in sensitivity , bandwidth and spectral resolution of _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra _  are now beginning to further qualify this standard picture , with indications that the energy , breadth and strength of the broad fe k@xmath2 line ( the inner disc component ) is a function of the luminosity and hardness of the x - ray continuum emission .",

    "interestingly , the _ asca _  spectral fit for mkn 509  indicated the presence of a warm absorber rather than a ` soft excess ' ( reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "mkn 509  was observed on 2000 october 25 during orbit 161 of the pv phase of _ xmm - newton_. the observations with the epic mos ( turner et al .",

    "the simultaneous rgs observation lasted @xmath130  ksec .",
    "the epic data were screened with the xmm sas ( science analysis software ) and pre - processed using the ccd gain values for the time of the observation .",

    "the non - x - ray background remained low throughout the observation .",
    "we initially extracted source and background spectra for the pn and both mos detectors separately . in each case a circular source region of 45  radius was defined around the centroid position of mkn 509 with the background being taken from an offset position close to the source . as there was little variability of mkn 509  ( @xmath1810% ) during the observations and no significant difference between the mos  1 and mos  2 spectra , we combined these into a single spectral file to maximise signal - to - noise .",

    "the background - subtracted spectra for the pn and combined mos detectors were then fitted , using xspec v11.0 , with the latest response matrices produced by the epic team ; the systematic level of uncertainty is @xmath20% .",
    "finally spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , to facilitate use of the @xmath21 minimisation technique . in the spectral analysis",
    "described in the following section , values of @xmath22  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and @xmath23 are assumed and all fit parameters are given in the agn rest - frame .",
    "errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level ( e.g. @xmath24 for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "we initially fitted the hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) spectrum of mkn 509  for the pn and mos data separately , with a power law and neutral absorption corresponding to the line - of - sight galactic column of @xmath25 .",
    "for the pn data the best - fit power - law index of @xmath26 showed significant excess flux between 67 kev suggestive of iron k - shell emission .",
    "very similar residuals were found from a fit to the mos data , albeit with a slightly flatter power law index of @xmath27 .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratio of measured flux to best - fit power law for both detector systems , with evidence for a narrow emission line near 6.4 kev and additional emission to the ` blue ' side .",
    "we then proceeded to fit the mos and pn data simultaneously , but allowing for a small normalisation difference .",
    "the power law indices were left free .",
    "the sequence of fits to the combined epic data for the 210 kev band are summarised in table 1 .    the initial comparison of the combined data set with a power law plus galactic absorption gave an unacceptable fit ( fit 1 in table 1 ) , mainly due to excess measured flux in the 67  kev region .",
    "the addition of a gaussian emission line , with energy and width free , produced a significantly improved fit ( @xmath28 for 3 additional parameters ; fit 2 in table 1 ) .",
    "the line appears marginally resolved ( with intrinsic width @xmath29  ev ) , has an ew of @xmath182 ev and lies at @xmath30 kev , in close agreement with the narrow line fit to the _ asca _  data .",
    "we note this rest energy is consistent with fluorescence from neutral iron .",
    "the addition of a second narrow gaussian emission line gave a further improvement ( @xmath31 for 3 extra parameters ) , with the overall fit - statistic now @xmath32 ( fit 3 in table 1 ) .",
    "this second emission line is less well determined , but clearly lies to the high energy side of the first line , with a best - fit energy of @xmath33  kev and ew @xmath144  ev .",
    "inclusion of the 2 gaussian lines in the fit increased the power law index by @xmath10.03 , to a value consistent with the directly measured index from 25 kev .      extrapolating the best - fit 210 kev spectrum ( fit 3 in table 1 ) to the lower useful limit of epic ( @xmath1  0.25 kev ) revealed a clear excess of soft x - ray flux below @xmath34  kev ( figure 2 ) . modelling this ` soft excess ' with a second power law , or a single black body , gave a poor fit ,",
    "the breadth of the soft excess requiring 3 black - body components to approach a minimum value of chi - squared .",
    "table 2 ( line 2 ) details this best - fit to the overall ( 0.2510 kev ) spectrum .",
    "parameterised in this way , the multiple bb components account for @xmath140% of the de - reddened luminosity of mkn 509  of @xmath35  erg s@xmath7 between 0.252  kev , but a negligible fraction of the harder ( 210 kev ) luminosity of @xmath36  erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the rgs spectrum showed no strong features between 638 (0.32  kev ) , other than the absorption edge of neutral interstellar oxygen at 23.3 (0.53 kev ) , supporting the epic modelling of the soft excess in terms of thermal continuum emission .",
    "however , detailed examination did reveal a weak absorption trough centred at 16.1  , and an unresolved absorption line at @xmath37   , which we tentatively identify with a blend of ne ix and fe xix ( figure 3a ) .",
    "both features are weak , with equivalent widths of @xmath38  ev and @xmath39  ev , respectively .",
    "although the long wavelength ` edge ' of the ` trough ' , at @xmath40   , is close to the k - edge of ovii ( 16.8 ) , the shape is unlike that of continuum absorption and we favour identification with absorption via an unresolved transition array ( mainly 2p3d transitions ) in fe m - shell ions , as found in the rgs spectrum of the infrared - loud quasar iras 13349 + 2438 ( sako et al .  2001 ; see also chenais - popovic et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the only emission features we find are consistent with the triplet of helium - like ovii ( see figure 3b ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the individual components are @xmath41  ev ( r ) , @xmath42  ev ( i ) and @xmath43  ev ( f ) .",
    "the relative weakness of the resonance line is consistent with emission from a photo - ionised gas , a point we take up again in section 5 . for",
    "now , we reiterate our main finding , that the high resolution rgs spectrum supports the epic modelling of the soft excess of mkn 509  in terms of thermal continuum emission .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of mkn 509  is strikingly similar to that of the low luminosity quasar , mkn 205 ( reeves et al .",
    "2001 ) , with the main spectral features in common being : a narrow fe k@xmath2 line at @xmath16.4 kev , additional emission centred at @xmath16.76.9 kev , and a moderately strong , featureless soft excess below @xmath12 kev . on a more detailed comparison ,",
    "the underlying power law in mkn 509  is only slightly harder ( @xmath10.1 in index ) , and the soft excess is very similar ( measured by the ratio of bb to pl flux at 0.252  kev : @xmath10.7 in mkn 509  and @xmath10.6 in mkn 205 ) .    in order to test our parameterisation of the mkn 509  spectrum against a physical model , we have compared our _ xmm - newton _  data for mkn 509 , and for the similar case of mkn 205 , with a model including the effects of x - ray reflection from an ionised disc .",
    "since the narrow line at 6.4 kev is believed to be unrelated to the disc emission it is excluded from the modelling .",
    "the model used here will be described in detail in nayakshin et al ( 2001 , in preparation ) , and here we only summarise it .",
    "the approach is similar to the one used for stellar spectra .",
    "specifically , a large number of models are computed for a range of values of the spectral index , the incident x - ray flux , disc gravity , the thermal disc flux and iron abundance .",
    "the output of each model is an un - smeared reflected spectrum for 5 different inclination angles ranging from nearly pole - on to nearly face on , stored in a look - up table .",
    "the ` lamppost ' geometry is then assumed , with free parameters of the model being the height of the x - ray source above the disc , @xmath44 , the dimensionless accretion rate through the disc , @xmath45 , the luminosity of the x - ray source , @xmath46 , the inner and outer disc radii , and the spectral index .",
    "this defines the gravity parameter , the ratio of x - ray to thermal fluxes , etc .",
    ", for each radius , which enables the look - up table to be used to approximate the reflected spectrum .",
    "this procedure is repeated for about 30 different radii .",
    "the total disc spectrum is then obtained by integrating over the disc surface , including relativistic smearing of the spectrum for a non - rotating black hole ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in using this model ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  data were first fitted between 210  kev , excluding the narrow @xmath16.4  kev line , and freezing @xmath44 at @xmath47 .",
    "good fits were obtained for both mkn 509  ( fit 4 in table 1 ) and mkn 205 , with the fe k feature being identified with predominantly helium - like fe , emitted at 6.7  kev , and observed at an inclination of @xmath130  degrees .",
    "figure 4 illustrates how the model is constrained by the overall profile , as well as the energy and strength of the line .",
    "we note in passing that the underlying power - law index is now @xmath10.1 higher as the fit also models the flattening due to continuum reflection at high energies .",
    "the ` red wing ' of the 6.7 kev line constrains the inner disc radius for mkn 509  to be @xmath48 . while not tightly constrained , the remaining parameters in the ionised disc model fit for mkn 509  are interesting , with a best fit for @xmath49 @xmath11 and an accretion rate @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 corresponds to the eddington limit ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the spectral table employed in the fits assumed that the power - law continuum extends out to @xmath52 kev , whereas a recent bepposax observation of mkn 509  has suggested that the high energy spectrum is modified by an approximately exponential roll - over at @xmath53 kev ( perola et al .",
    "if confirmed , this would be significant for our present fits since , for hard x - ray spectra such as mkn 509 , @xmath54 determines the compton temperature of the gas , and consequently the ionisation state of the reflector ( see the appendix and figures in nayakshin & kazanas 2001a ) . to test this",
    "we re - ran the code of nayakshin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with the best fit parameters described above , but with a cutoff energy of @xmath55 kev .",
    "we indeed found that this led to a substantially cooler temperature and a higher fraction of he - like iron in the skin .",
    "the latter then produced a much stronger he - like line than required by our data ( @xmath1300  ev ) . to recover the ionization state of the skin to the degree corresponding to our @xmath56 kev fit , we needed to increase @xmath49 to a value much higher than unity .",
    "this contrasts sharply with a deduction from the sed of mkn 509  which suggests that @xmath49 is much _ smaller _ than unity ( see walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , kriss et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the ionising uv luminosity of mkn 509  is @xmath57 erg s@xmath7 , while its 2 - 10 kev luminosity is @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , for the condition @xmath59 ( required by our photo - ionisation model ) to be consistent with the observed luminosity ratio , we need to invoke a geometry of the x - ray source different from the ` lamppost ' .",
    "an origin of the hard x - ray emission in magnetic flares above the disc is an attractive possibility , since in that case only a small fraction of the disc is illuminated by the flare and hence the local ionising flux is much larger than @xmath60 ( for estimates see nayakshin & kazanas 2001b ) .",
    "in addition , the hard x - ray spectrum of mkn 509  puts constraints on the amount of cooling due to reprocessed radiation , again requiring a patchy corona ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "an important property of all ionised discs is that they reflect strongly at low x - ray energies where neutral discs absorb the internally scattered photons .",
    "to check the contribution of such enhanced reflection on the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum , the best - fit ionised disc model at 210  kev ( fit 4 in table 1 ) was extrapolated over the full data bandwidth .",
    "a soft excess is still strongly required , but now the hottest bb component is removed by the enhanced reflection of the ionised disc below @xmath12  kev .",
    "this full - band fit is summarised in line 3 of table 2 .",
    "a by - product of the ionised disc fit is that the narrow 6.4  kev line ew falls to @xmath150 ev , and is now completely unresolved by the epic detectors ( @xmath61  ev ) , but still remains statistically very significant .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _  observation of mkn 509  found the source in a relatively faint state , with the 210  kev flux about half of its previously measured value . that may account for the mean power - law being somewhat flatter than in earlier measurements .",
    "however , our spectral fits clearly show the presence of a ` soft excess ' which lies well above the power - law even when the latter is enhanced at low energies by reflection from a strongly ionised disc .",
    "of particular interest is the appearance of two components in the fe k band , and we note the similarity to the _ xmm - newton _  observation of mkn 205 .    the most prominent feature , at 6.4  kev , we identify with the narrow line component now emerging as a common feature of seyfert 1 spectra ( e.g. reeves et al .",
    "2001 , yaqoob et al .",
    "2001 , kaspi et al .",
    "recognition of this separate component to the fe k emission has two important consequences .",
    "first , fitting of the broader line profiles commonly seen in _",
    "spectra of bright ( generally lower luminosity ) seyferts should now allow for a separate contribution to the line core at 6.4 kev .",
    "nandra et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , in their survey of _ asca _  spectra of agn , found no requirement for a narrow fe k@xmath2 line , but with upper limits to the ew of order @xmath1100  ev .",
    "however , lubinski & zdziarski ( 2001 ) in their analysis of a larger sample of seyfert 1s did suggest that the narrow emission line component may be important .",
    "secondly , the detection of a strong , narrow iron emission line at 6.4 kev indicates that a substantial quantity of cool reprocessing material  lying outside of the line - of - sight since the x - ray spectrum shows no intrinsic absorption  is illuminated by the central x - ray source . the line strength ( ew@xmath62  ev ) implies that the cool matter subtends a solid angle of at least 1 @xmath63 steradian , assuming it is thomson thick and has a solar abundance of iron ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the most likely location of such material , within the framework of current agn models , would appear to be the molecular torus ( antonucci 1993 ) , with hard x - rays from the central engine being reflected off the inner surface of the torus and into the line - of - sight of the observer ( krolik , madau & zycki 1994 , ghisellini et al .",
    "we can not , however , at present rule out other alternatives , given the epic ccd spectral resolution , including emission from blr clouds ( leahy & creighton 1993 ) .",
    "the detection of emission from strongly ionised fe is of particular interest in relation to exploring the inner accretion disc .",
    "we note that high ionisation fe k lines have previously been suggested by _",
    "data of several radio - quiet quasars ( reeves & turner 2000 ) , while the so - called x - ray baldwin effect has been invoked to describe the apparent tendency ( in _ asca _",
    "spectra ) for the fe k emission to be weaker for higher luminosity agn ( nandra et al .",
    "the _ xmm - newton_observations of mkn 509  and mkn 205 now confirm , for 2 high luminosity agn , that the fe - k emission is indeed relatively weak . a reduction in strength of the",
    "observed he - like fe k line can be understood if the accretion disc develops an over - ionised hot skin produced by the strong hard x - ray illumination ( nayakshin et al .",
    "2000 , ballantyne et al .",
    "2001 ) . assuming the low value for the high energy spectral rollover",
    "as observed by bepposax , we find that a large ratio of the ionising flux to the local disc thermal flux is required to keep the ` skin ' hot enough .",
    "given the observed ratio of x - ray luminosity to optical - uv luminosity @xmath64 , this then requires a flux concentration which is only plausible if the x - rays originate from localised sources , e.g. magnetic flares near the disc surface .    aside from the fe k line emission , the epic x - ray spectrum of mkn 509appears to be devoid of other discrete emission or absorption features .",
    "in particular the absence of strong recombination emission from si , mg , ne and o constrains the disc reflection model to high values of the effective ionisation parameter .",
    "thus we are apparently observing the bare nuclear continuum emission in mkn 509 , with the soft excess flux arising as thermal emission from the inner accretion disc .    finally , we comment briefly on the rgs spectrum .",
    "the detection of an absorption trough at 1617  , which we tentatively identify with absorption in fe m ions , is interesting , particularly in comparison with the discovery of this feature in iras 13349 + 2438 from an earlier _ xmm - newton _   observation ( sako et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the latter case",
    "the absorption was interpreted as arising in a cool gas component associated with the dust that causes strong reddening in the optical band ( e(b - v)=0.3 ) . in mkn 509",
    "the optical reddening is more than an order of magnitude less , implying that here the temperature of this cool material remains too high for dust grains to survive .",
    "a further implication of the fe m absorption in mkn 509 , if confirmed , is that it raises a question about the common occurrence of ovii absorption edges , particularly in the analysis of _ asca _  data ( e.g. reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "the narrow absorption line at 13.5  , and the emission from ovii require a zone of higher ionisation in the line - of - sight material , and the ratio of components in the ovii triplet suggest an origin in a photoionised gas with electron density greater than @xmath65  @xmath66 and electron temperature less than @xmath67  k ( porquet and dubau 2000 ) .",
    "observations with _ xmm - newton _  have revealed 2 apparently separate components to the fe k line emission of the high luminosity seyfert 1 galaxy , mkn 509 . instead of a broad iron line component centred near 6.4 kev , with a strong ` red ' wing , as found in lower luminosity seyfert galaxies , and explained by reflection from `` cold '' matter in the inner accretion disc , we find a relatively weak line centred at 6.76.9 kev .",
    "we model this feature in terms of fluorescence from he - like iron in the highly ionised inner disc material .",
    "the energy , equivalent width and profile of this feature are all important in the model fitting , as is the high energy cutoff of the illuminating x - rays . if a cutoff as low as @xmath55 kev ( perola et al .",
    "2000 ) is confirmed then our modelling suggests the illuminating x - ray flux @xmath68 in order that the he - like line is not much stronger than we observe .",
    "our tentative conclusion is to suggest a geometry in which the hard x - ray emission arises in magnetic flares above the disc ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001b ) .",
    "the narrow line at 6.4 kev appears to be an increasingly common feature in the higher quality spectral data emerging from _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ , and probably arises from compton scattering off distant , cool matter . if this material is in the putative molecular torus , then  as with mkn 205  this provides important evidence that a substantial torus exists for agn with bolometric luminosities as high as @xmath69  erg s@xmath7 .",
    "however , it appears that narrow 6.4 kev iron lines are weak or absent in higher luminosity qsos .",
    "for example , upper limits of 10 ev have been set on narrow 6.4 kev lines in the high luminosity quasars pks0558@xmath70504 ( obrien et al .",
    "2001 ) , s5 0836 + 710 and pks 2149@xmath70306 ( fang et al .",
    "whatever the origin of the neutral gas , the observations imply a smaller covering factor for such gas in high - luminosity objects .",
    "if confirmed by observations of a larger sample of agn , the apparent correlation of narrow 6.4 kev line strength with bolometric luminosity is consistent with torus models involving a dusty , disc - driven hydromagnetic wind ( konigl et al .",
    "1994 ) , which predict that the dust distribution will be ` flattened ' due to radiation pressure in high luminosity agn , hence reducing the solid angle subtended by the torus .",
    "this work is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "the authors would especially like to thank the epic and rgs instrument teams , and the soc and ssc staff for making the observation and subsequent analysis possible .",

    "<S> the energy and strength of this line is consistent with fluorescence from ` neutral ' iron in the molecular torus , and we note the emerging ubiquity of this feature in _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  observations of seyfert 1 galaxies over a wide luminosity range . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence for a second emission line at 6.76.9  kev , which we attempt to model by reflection from a highly ionised disc . </S>",
    "<S> a ` soft excess ' , evident as an upward curvature in the continuum flux below @xmath11.5  kev , can not be explained solely by enhanced reflection from the ionised disc . </S>",
    "<S> the rgs spectrum shows only weak discrete emission and absorption features in the soft x - ray spectrum , supporting our conclusion that the soft excess emission in mkn 509  represents the high energy portion of optically thick , thermal emission from the inner accretion disc . </S>"
