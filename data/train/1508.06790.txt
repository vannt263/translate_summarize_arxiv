    "the numerical study by schmal et al .",
    "@xcite of a model for seasonal effects on the circadian clock shows stability pockets and chains thereof in the parameter plane .",
    "this study aims to complement their results by giving a theoretical background for the observed phenomena .",
    "we also indicate what is to be expected when their system is perturbed .",
    "the setting of the problem is bifurcations of parameter dependent dynamical systems , in particular periodically forced oscillators .",
    "a periodically forced oscillator shows periodic dynamics or synchronization if the frequency of the forcing is close enough to a rational multiple of the frequency of the oscillator in absence of forcing . on the other hand , if this frequency ratio is not close enough to a rational number for many frquency ratio s the dynamics is quasi periodic .",
    "now we consider the periodically forced oscillator as a system of two asymmetrically coupled oscillators , where the first is forced by the second .",
    "the latter has fixed dynamics .",
    "in particular its frequency is fixed and we set it equal to one by a scaling of time .",
    "thus the frequency of the first oscillator becomes an essential parameter of the system .",
    "another important parameter is the coupling strength . in the parameter plane of coupling strength versus frequency",
    "there are regions , called arnold tongues ( see @xcite ) or resonance regions , where the first oscillator synchronizes with the second , that is there are one or more stable ( and unstable ) periodic solutions .",
    "these tongues are wedge shaped and their vertices lie at rational points on the frequency axis .",
    "so for a fixed value of the coupling strength there is a frequency interval where synchronization occurs . on the boundary of this interval",
    "the periodic solutions disappear in saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "if the coupling strength goes to zero the interval shrinks to a ( rational ) point .",
    "if the coupling strength increases there may be many other bifurcations , for example period doubling bifurcations , see @xcite .    in certain examples of periodically forced oscillators",
    "the tongues close again in a second vertex , forming a so called called _ stability pocket _ ( called _ arnold onion _ by schmal et al .",
    "@xcite ) , see left part of figure [ fig : mtpocket ] .",
    "this phenomenon occurs for example in hill s equation and it has already been observed by van der pol & strutt @xcite , although they do not mention it explicitly as such .",
    "much later hill s equation has been reanalyzed by broer & levi @xcite using methods not available to van der pol & strutt",
    ". then the term _ instability pocket _ was introduced .",
    "however , it depends on the point of view whether a pocket is called a stability or an instability pocket , see remark [ rem : pockets ] .",
    "although the context of the hill equation differs from ours , the mechanism by which the pockets are formed is the same . in both systems",
    "a general underlying system has a wedge shaped resonance region .",
    "the map that takes the parameter space of the specific example to the parameter space of the general system has one or more folds , thus generating pockets .    the model in schmal et al .",
    "@xcite consists of a differential equation for a specific two dimensional oscillator , in fact the normal form of the hopf bifurcation , with periodic forcing . here",
    "we take a slightly different approach .",
    "our oscillator will be a general phase oscillator asymmetrically coupled to a second phase oscillator with constant frequency , the forcing oscillator or zeitgeber .",
    "first we study a general coupling and approximate the poincar map .",
    "then we use these results to study seasonality like in @xcite by considering a periodic block function as forcing , where the length of the block ( modeling the length of the daylight interval and thus season ) is controlled by an additional parameter .",
    "we could have started with a general oscillator in two dimensions with an external periodic forcing .",
    "but then the technicalities of bringing the system in manageable form and keeping it so when the external forcing is applied would obscure the phenomenon we want to study .",
    "our primary goal is the way the dynamics in the phase direction of the oscillator changes when the external force is applied : we are less interested in the change of the shape and position of the periodic orbit .",
    "therefore we start with a phase oscillator from the very beginning .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be phase angles so @xmath2 where @xmath0 is interpreted as the phase angle of the oscillator and @xmath1 as the phase angle of the external forcing .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath3 be a smooth function on @xmath4 .",
    "the following asymmetrically coupled system describes a periodically forced phase oscillator .",
    "@xmath5 the system depends on small parameters @xmath6 .",
    "the frequency of the oscillator is @xmath7 for @xmath8 . in that case",
    "the dynamics of the system is quasi - periodic if @xmath7 is irrational , but if @xmath7 is rational , the dynamics is periodic .",
    "thus for @xmath8 periodic dynamics is exceptional and quasi periodic dynamics is typical .",
    "this changes dramatically if @xmath9 , then periodic dynamics becomes typical .",
    "thus it seems natural to take a closer look near rational values of @xmath7 , therefore we set @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 relative prime integers and @xmath13 is a small parameter .",
    "it is most efficient to study this system via a poincar map .",
    "a good candidate is the map that scores @xmath0 at consecutive crossings of @xmath14 , sometimes called the stroboscopic map . since all poincar maps are equivalent , results will not depend on this choice .",
    "for convenience we switch to the lift of this system to @xmath15 , then the differential equation becomes @xmath16 now we define the ( lift of the ) poincar map as follows .",
    "[ def : tpopmap ] let @xmath17 be the flow of equation , then the poincar map @xmath18 is implicitly defined by @xmath19 .",
    "the map @xmath18 in this definition is the lift of a circle map @xmath20 ( not to be confused with @xmath3 ) , the poincar map on the circle . in actual computations it is easier to use the lift @xmath18 . now since @xmath18 is the lift of a circle map it must be of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a 1-periodic function .",
    "unfortunately there is no easy connection between @xmath22 and @xmath20 in equation .",
    "but by a so called normal form transformation we obtain a vectorfield approximation of the poincar map @xmath18 , see section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "the approximating vectorfield is in the righthand side of the following equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 depends in a complicated way on the taylor - fourier coefficients of @xmath3 and the sum runs over all @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to be more precise",
    ", the time-1 flow of this vector field approximates the poincar map .",
    "this is formulated more precisely in section [ sec : vvapprox ] .",
    "the main property of the poincar map @xmath20 we use is that a stationary or a periodic point of @xmath20 corresponds to a periodic solution of equation and vice verse .",
    "thus the existence of periodic solutions of equation can be read off from the existence of stationary or periodic points of @xmath20 .",
    "the vectorfield approximation does not cover the full dynamics of the original system .",
    "but hyperbolic stationary points of correspond to stationary points of the poincar map @xmath18 . moreover by persistence of saddle - node bifurcations",
    "we recover the well - known picture of resonance tongues for @xmath18 in the @xmath29-plane from equation .",
    "for each pair @xmath30 a tongue emanates from the @xmath7-axis at @xmath31 .",
    "the tongue at @xmath32 is called the _ main tongue _ , the others are just labeled by the pair @xmath30 .",
    "indeed we may rewrite the differential equation as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a 1-periodic function .",
    "then at least near @xmath35 stationary points exist in a region in the @xmath36-plane bounded by curves of saddle - node bifurcations of the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for some constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the simplest case where @xmath41 we have @xmath42 .    in the next section",
    "we take a specific form for equation containing parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 and we study the map @xmath45 .",
    "the inverse image of this map takes the tongues of the general equation for two asymmetrically coupled oscillators to the resonance regions of model with season dependent forcing .",
    "in a simple model of season dependent forcing we take a phase oscillator with a particular 1-periodic forcing",
    ". we will call it the _ seasonal oscillator _ for short . the general form",
    "will be the following .",
    "@xmath46 here @xmath20 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 functions on @xmath49 so that the corresponding vector field is also @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath20 describes the non - linearity of the oscillator and @xmath47 determines the external periodic forcing . as before we take @xmath50 , with positive integers @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are small , but not necessarily of the same order .    to model seasonality",
    "we use a function as in @xcite , namely one that depends on a non - small parameter @xmath44 , which determines the fraction of the period the forcing is on. thus we interpret @xmath53 as winter and @xmath54 as summer. a simple example being a block function with a block of length @xmath55 $ ] @xmath56 with @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "this function is not @xmath48 .",
    "therefore we replace @xmath47 by the convolution @xmath59 where @xmath60 is for example the function @xmath61 . in section [ sec : fcf ] we will show that the result does not depend on the choice of @xmath60 . for simplicity we assume from now on that @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "we use the methods of the previous section to find a vectorfield approximation of the poincar map for the seasonal oscillator .",
    "the following theorem gives a more precise statement . for a proof see section [ sec : apmapso ] where",
    "also the meaning of _ degree _ will be clarified .    [ the : season ]",
    "the vectorfield approximation up to degree two of the poincar map of equation is @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the fourier coefficients of @xmath20 and @xmath47 are @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , where @xmath66    we wish to find a region in the parameter space of the seasonal oscillator , that is in the @xmath67-plane , where stationary points of equation exist . since this equation is a special form of equation we consider the map @xmath45 .",
    "the result is formulated in the following theorem .",
    "[ the : pockets ] let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be relative prime as mentioned before .",
    "then the map @xmath45 is implicitly given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants and @xmath22 is a @xmath71-periodic function with zero average .",
    "this implies that the @xmath30-tongue has @xmath11 _ stability pockets_.    the map implicitly defined in the theorem takes the main tongue of a general periodically forced oscillator into a so called _ stability pocket _ in the @xmath67-plane of the seasonal oscillator .",

    "we use perturbation theory so we have to be precise about the size of various components .",

    "this will only be a sketch of the proof , for more details see @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the proof is that every @xmath48 near identity coordinate transformation can be approximated as closely as needed by the flow of a @xmath48 vectorfield @xcite .",

    "the vectorfield @xmath145 approximates the poincar map of the vectorfield @xmath113 in but there is no equivalence .",
    "therefore we have to be careful when drawing conclusions about the dynamics of from analysis of the vectorfield @xmath145 . here",
    "we will be mainly interested in stationary points of @xmath145 .",
    "a first observation is that hyperbolic stationary points of @xmath145 correspond to relative equilibria of @xmath115 and thus to periodic orbits of @xmath113 ( provided that the difference between @xmath113 and @xmath115 is small enough ) .",

    "dynamically speaking the boundaries of the wedge are curves of saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "these form the familiar stability tongues or arnold tongues . since saddle - node bifurcations in one parameter families persist under small perturbations , the stability tongues of vectorfield @xmath145 approximate those of vectorfield @xmath113 .    for each combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( positive and relative prime )",
    "we find a tongue .",
    "the one for @xmath165 is called the main tongue .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the taylor - fourier coefficients rapidly decrease for increasing @xmath25 and @xmath26 then the leading terms in equation are @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are determined by @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "then the vectorfield is @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 . for both @xmath99 and @xmath186 we set @xmath187 . in view of the resonance condition @xmath27 for a term @xmath188 ,",
    "see proposition [ pro : vvapprox ] , there will be no resonant terms of degree 1 , therefore we set @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
