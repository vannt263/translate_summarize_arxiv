    "the berry - tabor conjecture @xcite for quantum integrable systems with discrete spectra asserts that the spacings between normalized eigenvalues of a quantum integrable system should exhibit poisson statistics in the semi - classical limit .",

    "we consider a class of incomplete two dimensional smooth manifolds denoted by @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 is a topological completion of @xmath29 .",
    "we can then consider @xmath31 as a manifold with a conic singularity .",
    "the manifold @xmath32 is globally parametrized by @xmath33 and we put on it metrics of revolution : @xmath34 the metric is assumed to be a short range _ cylindrical end _",
    "metric , that is , we require that @xmath35 at @xmath36 we assume a conic structure : @xmath37 we also make a convexity assumption by demanding that @xmath38 the metric can be extended to a smooth metric on @xmath39 ( endowed with a natural @xmath40 structure coming from polar coordinates , @xmath41 ) if and only if @xmath42 see for instance @xcite",
    ". we will not assume and consequently we allow _ bullet like _ surfaces shown in fig.1 .",
    "the classical dynamics is given by the hamiltonian flow of the metric : @xmath43 where we parametrized @xmath44 by @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 dual to @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . as is well known this flow is completely integrable : @xmath50 and @xmath51 is called the clairaut integral .",

    "although it plays no part in the proof , this is worth presenting here as the global action variables are closely related to the asymptotics of the phase shifts .",
    "the moment map @xmath56 has the range given by the open set @xmath57 consists of a @xmath58 orbit of a single geodesic in @xmath59 ( the @xmath60-action corresponds to the geodesic flow and the @xmath61-action to the @xmath49-rotation ) .    in the case of case of a _ simple _ surface of revolution , the global action variables , @xmath62 ,",
    "are defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a global trivialization of the bundle @xmath65 of the homology groups along the the fibers of @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 is chosen as the orbit of the @xmath68-action , then @xmath69 . in the case of non - compact surfaces discussed here the fibers",
    "are given by @xmath58 and not by @xmath70 ( except for the degenerate case of the meridians , @xmath71 where the fiber is @xmath72 where @xmath73 corresponds to the point @xmath36 ) .",
    "consequently the integral for @xmath74 given by diverges ( for @xmath75 we can still take the compact orbit of the @xmath53-action ) .",
    "hence we have to normalize the integral using the fact that the surface is asymptotic to a cylinder with @xmath76 .",
    "if we take @xmath77 to correspond to a geodesic in @xmath78 , then outside of the turning point @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 for the degenerate case of the meridians ) it can be parametrized by @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 and we can put @xmath83 that is we normalize by subtracting the  free \" @xmath82 defined by @xmath84 . from this",
    "we find the angle variables as in @xcite,@xcite .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "we shall not however use this point of view here .",
    "instead we will proceed more classically and we will define the scattering matrix using the wave operators  see @xcite for an indication of the relation between the two approaches . as in the proof of proposition [ p:1 ]",

    "in the situation we consider the existence of @xmath106 is quite straightforward and we choose the wave rather than the schrdinger picture just for variety .",
    "the scattering operator is @xmath107 and , as we will see below it is a unitary operator .    when there is no pure point spectrum then the wave operators @xmath108 are themselves unitary .",
    "in all situations they are partial isometries and @xmath109 .",
    "the null space of @xmath110 is the span of the @xmath111 eigenfunctions of @xmath112 . under our assumptions",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath118 where the schwartz kernel of @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 because @xmath121 commutes with the generator of the free propagator , @xmath122 we obtain the scattering matrix at fixed energy using the above spectral decomposition : @xmath123 and then the decomposition corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath52 : @xmath124 from the structure of @xmath119 it is clear that @xmath125 for @xmath126 . for @xmath127 we follow @xcite and put @xmath128 we also note that @xmath129 .    for @xmath130 , @xmath131 is a unitary operator , that is , it is given by multiplication by a complex number of unit length : @xmath132 and the number @xmath133 is the @xmath134th _ phase shift _ at energy @xmath8 .",
    "another way to think about @xmath135 is as a diagonal unitary @xmath136 matrix , where @xmath137 $ ] : @xmath138 a more `` down - to - earth '' definition , following the traditional way of introducing phase shifts in one dimensional scattering , is given through asymptotic expansions in below .",
    "the uniform behaviour as @xmath14 and @xmath139 go to infinity and @xmath140 is a well understood semi - classical problem . to describe it we separate variables in the eigen - equation of the laplacian .",
    "we remark that this procedure can also provide direct proofs of the general scattering theoretical statements above .",
    "the laplace operator is given by @xmath141 and on the eigenspaces of @xmath142 it acts as @xmath143 the reduced operator appearing in brackets in the second line above has a self - adjoint realization on @xmath144 and for large @xmath139 it can be considered semi - classically : @xmath145 the principal symbol of @xmath146 is given by @xmath147 and the natural range of @xmath148 for which semi - classical methods are applicable is given by @xmath149 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath150 is one at infinity , we approach zero energy when @xmath151 is close to @xmath152 . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath153 the characteristic variety of @xmath154 has a singular limit ",
    "see fig.3 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the @xmath153 limit has to involve the lower order terms in @xmath155 .",
    "in particular , miraculous cancellations in the expansions due to the interaction between the leading and lower order terms occur when we have _ product type _",
    "conic singularities since we can then use the theory of bessel functions .",
    "the general situation is , at least to the authors , unclear at the moment .",
    "what is quite clear is that we have a uniform expansion in @xmath156 .",
    "the phase shifts @xmath133 are related to the semi - classical phase shifts of the operator @xmath157 , @xmath158 which are defined by asymptotics of solutions : @xmath159 we recall now the essentially standard asymptotic properties of @xmath160 ",
    "see @xcite , chapter 6 and for a more microlocal discussion @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we can describe this connection between the phase shifts and action variables by saying that @xmath170 is a quantum map on @xmath171 , the space of geodesics .",
    "we now digress to explain this statement in more detail . for simplicity we will consider @xmath115 at integral values of @xmath139 and denote them by @xmath172 .",
    "since it is not needed in the calculation of the limit pair correlation function we give a somewhat sketchy discussion and refer to @xcite for background on toeplitz quantization .",
    "see also @xcite for a related discussion from a physicist s point of view .",
    "we can identify @xmath171 with the set @xmath173 of incoming vectors at the parallel @xmath174 as in proposition [ p:2 ] we have to to delete @xmath175-neighborhoods of the singular set , given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the first action variable and @xmath178 is the energy .",
    "we denote the deleted space of geodesics by @xmath179 and identify it with the set @xmath180 of incoming vectors at @xmath181 with incoming angle satisfying @xmath182 and @xmath183 if we consider the deleted space of geodesics as a phase space then , on the quantum level , it corresponds to the sequence of truncated hilbert spaces @xmath184 spanned by the eigenfunctions @xmath185 of the quantum action @xmath186 with @xmath187 where @xmath188 here , @xmath189 plays the role of the planck constant and we restrict it to integral values . since @xmath184 is invariant under @xmath190 we may restrict the latter to a unitary scattering matrix @xmath191 on @xmath184 .",
    "we now state the somewhat informal :    [ p : z ] the sequence @xmath192 is a semiclassical quantum map over @xmath179 associated to the classical scattering map @xmath193 where @xmath194 is obtained by following the geodesic @xmath195 through @xmath196 until it intersects @xmath197 for the last time and reflecting the outgoing tangent vector inward .    from the explicit formula",
    "@xmath198 we see that @xmath191 is the exponential of @xmath199 times the hamiltonian @xmath200 on @xmath184 where @xmath201 is a smooth cutoff function defining the truncated hilbert space .",
    "the truncated phase space @xmath179 is symplectically equivalent to a truncated @xmath28 , equipped with its standard area form , with neighbourhoods of the poles and of the equator deleted .",
    "indeed , the equivalence is defined by the identity map between global action - angle charts on the surfaces .",
    "this map intertwines the obvious @xmath3 actions which rotate the spaces .",
    "the quantization of this chart then defines a unitary equivalence on the quantum level which intertwines the operators @xmath202 on cylinder and sphere ( they can be considered as the angular momentum operators ) .",
    "the equivalence is specified up to a choice of @xmath203 phases by mapping the spherical harmonic of degree @xmath199 which transforms under rotation by @xmath204 on @xmath28 by @xmath205 to the exponential @xmath205 with @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "the map is completely specified by requiring that the spherical harmonic be real valued along @xmath207    thus we may identify @xmath208 with a hamiltonian over the compact phase space @xmath209 since it is a function of the ( toeplitz ) action operator @xmath210 it is necessarily a semiclassical toeplitz operator of order zero with principal symbol @xmath211 on @xmath28 .",
    "the semiclassical parameter @xmath199 is identified in the toeplitz theory with a first order positive elliptic toeplitz operator with eigenvalue @xmath199 in @xmath212 ",
    "see @xcite and references given there .",
    "hence @xmath213 is a first order toeplitz operator of real principal type . as in the essentially analogous case of pseudodifferential operators ,",
    "the exponential of a first order toeplitz operator of real principal type is a fourier integral toeplitz operator whose underlying classical map is the hamilton flow generated by @xmath214 .",
    "we now wish to identify this map at time one with the classical scattering ( or billiard ball ) map on @xmath180 , that is , we wish to prove that @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the hamilton vector field of @xmath217    indeed , let us work in the symplectic action - angle coordinates @xmath218 where @xmath204 is the angle along @xmath181 .",
    "the hamilton flow of @xmath214 then takes the form @xmath219 at time @xmath220 the angle along the parallel @xmath181 changes by @xmath221 .",
    "we claim that @xmath221 is also the change in angle along the incoming geodesic through @xmath222 in the direction @xmath223 as it scatters in the bullet head before exiting again along @xmath181 .",
    "to see this , we use proposition [ p:2 ] which shows that @xmath224 is closely related to the second action variable : in the notation of the proof of proposition [ p:1 ] @xmath225 since @xmath226 is preserved by the flow we can fix it at @xmath227 and then @xmath228 on the other hand the equations of motion show that @xmath229 it follows that @xmath230 is twice the change in angle as the radial distance changes from @xmath231 to its minimum along the geodesic .",
    "the piece of the geodesic lying in the bullet - head consists of two segments : the initial segment beginning on @xmath232 and ending upon its tangential intersection with the parallel @xmath233 closest to @xmath4 , and the segment beginning at this intersection and ending on @xmath234 the change in @xmath204-angle along both segments is the same , so that the total change in angle during the scattering is given by the integral above .",
    "this shows that @xmath235 and @xmath236 have precisely the same formula in action - angle variables and completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "following @xcite we will reduce the study of to a study of certain exponential sums .",
    "we first remark that because of symmetries of @xmath12 we can study a slightly simpler expression @xmath237 as one easily checks that @xmath238    the reduction to exponential sums follows from an application of the poisson summation formula in @xmath36 : @xmath239 ^ 2 }   \\sum _ { \\ell \\in { \\bbb z } } \\hat f \\left ( \\frac { 2 \\pi \\ell }   { ( 1 - 2 \\epsilon ) \\lambda } \\right ) \\left|   \\sum _ { \\epsilon",

    "* as was emphasized by the referee , propositions [ p:3 ] and [ p:4 ] are essentially sharp .",
    "the `` diagonal '' solutions @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 give a lower bound @xmath344 .",
    "hence , no essential improvement of the theorem in sect.1 is possible by this method .",
    "to prove the main theorem we need to construct a family of surfaces , @xmath345 , for which in the expansion of the phase shifts , @xmath346 so that we can apply propositions [ p:3 ] and [ p:4 ] . recalling proposition [ p:2 ] , this means that we want to find @xmath347 satisfying - , and such that @xmath348 with @xmath264 convex or concave .",
    "we will now skip the indices @xmath349 and @xmath350 .",
    "if we write @xmath351 and @xmath352 then @xmath353 and we might study the simpler function @xmath354 instead . from the assumptions on @xmath355 , @xmath356 is monotonically decreasing and @xmath357 is smooth and non - zero at @xmath80 . hence there exists a smooth monotonically increasing function , @xmath358 , such that @xmath359 since we can write @xmath48 as a function of @xmath360 we define @xmath361 that way we can express @xmath362 as a linear transform of @xmath363 : @xmath364 from this we immediately get a _ linear model _ correspoding to @xmath365 : @xmath366 since @xmath367    * remark . * the surfaces defined using the linear model do _ not _ have uniform pair correlations measures . in that case",
    "we can compute the leading contribution to @xmath368 directly . to apply propositions",
    "[ p:3 ] and [ p:4 ] we need to have the linear term in @xmath224 and that forces the singularity at @xmath369 for our surfaces : only one value of @xmath349 corresponds to a smooth surface .",
    "we want to introduce the convex or concave term in @xmath224 by perturbing the case @xmath370 .",
    "for that let us first establish some simple properties of the transform @xmath371 .",
    "we denote by @xmath372 smooth functions with bounded derivatives and by @xmath373 spaces of poly - homogeneous ( classical ) symbols .",
    "to prove the first part of the lemma we write @xmath378 where the first term on the right hand side is clearly in @xmath379 .",
    "in the second term , the integrand can be rewritten as @xmath380 thus we are concerned with integrals of the form @xmath381 where the first term is smooth and uniformly bounded in @xmath14 .",
    "to study the second term we write @xmath382 which gives @xmath383 for @xmath384 and @xmath385 for finitely many @xmath386 .",
    "since we check that @xmath387 we can sum up the contributions from different @xmath388 s ( @xmath389 , @xmath390 , and we use the uniform convergence of @xmath391 ) .",
    "thus for every @xmath392 we obtain @xmath393 and consequently @xmath394 .",
    "guided by the two lemmas we can easily construct a family of surfaces for which @xmath224 has the needed properties . we want to find @xmath404 such that for @xmath350 small enough and @xmath349 close to @xmath405 , @xmath406 , and so that @xmath407 obtained from inverting the process described above has the properties - .",
    "this is easily achieved by demanding that @xmath408 is a symbol of order @xmath409 on @xmath410 .",
    "we also want @xmath411 described in lemma [ l:3 ] to have a fixed sign . from the formula",
    "we see that that @xmath264 is concave if @xmath412 in fact , the integrand has the same sign as @xmath413 and that is positive for any @xmath414 if holds .",
    "[ p:5 ] for @xmath349 in a neighbourhood of a fixed @xmath415 and for @xmath350 small enough , let @xmath416 be obtained from @xmath417 by the following procedure : @xmath418 then @xmath419 has the properties - and for the set of two parameter families of surfaces @xmath420 the leading part of the phase shifts depends linearly on @xmath421 and @xmath350 and holds .",
    "combined with propositions [ p:2 ] and [ p:4 ] this provides an infinite dimensional family of perturbations of the linear model each giving a two parameter family of surfaces for which the theorem of sect.1 holds .",

    "recalling and the discussion preceding it we see that all for @xmath426 @xmath427 proposition [ p:4 ] now shows that the assumptions of lemma [ l:1 ] are satisfied with @xmath428 and that lemma gives the statement of the main theorem .",
