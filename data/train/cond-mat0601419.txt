    "a brownian particle is a massive particle ( @xmath0 ) , surrounded by a bath of lighter particles ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "its motion is very irregular and varies rapidly with time .",
    "however , its averaged behavior can be well understood .",
    "the reason for this is that the mass ratio ( @xmath2 ) leads to the separation of time - scales for the slow brownian s degrees of freedom from the fast bath s degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to construct adequate methods ( e.g. fokker - planck equations ) to describe the time evolution for the probability distribution function , or equivalently , for the momenta of the distribution  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distribution is thus obtained as a function of the equilibrium momenta .",
    "we do not need to point out that the behavior of brownian particles has been the subject of many scientific studies since einstein s seminal papers  @xcite , already a hundred years old .",
    "interesting extensions of this old problem have attracted the interest of many groups lately  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of non - standard forms of the noise function has also been successfully obtained recently  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the equilibrium distribution for a damped harmonically bound brownian particle as a direct integral , by means of laplace transforms .",
    "however , a word is necessary to explain the use of the heavy machinery of laplace transforms upon such a well known model .",
    "in fact , the present model is only used as an illustration for the time - averaging method we propose .",
    "applications for more interesting systems will follow .",
    "it basically consists in arranging the full dynamical behavior , expressed by the exact time - averaged distribution , into sums of integrals that can be proved either to vanish identically or to be easily calculable .",
    "thus , the exact equilibrium distribution is obtained .",
    "further extensions of the method are under way for non - gaussian noise  @xcite .",
    "technically , we define the equilibrium distribution in the spirit of boltzmann s prescription  @xcite as a time - averaged distribution .",
    "the equilibrium distribution calculation is done by carrying out analytically the calculation for the time average of the distribution defined below , via the use of the stochastic functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , solutions of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "it reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 means average over the noise @xmath7 . for ergodic systems fulfilling @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laplace transform of @xmath10",
    ", we can use an equivalent form for eq .",
    "[ timeaverage ] , namely @xmath11    as mentioned above , the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are solutions of the langevin equations that follow from coupling the brownian particle to a bath of lighter particles .",
    "we assume these to influence the brownian dynamics via an effective non - white gaussian noise force @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of time - correlations leads to the renormalization of the oscillator frequency at equilibrium ( all results are exact ) , discussed in the next section .",
    "our approach is straightforward and allows us to separate the reversible from the irreversible parts of the dynamics .",
    "the equilibrium distribution ( the irreversible part ) is obtained by opening the delta - function on eq .",
    "[ timeaveragez ] by laplace transformation into an infinite series , and by keeping only non - vanishing terms in it ( in the limit @xmath12 ) . as will be made clear in the following , the vanishing terms ( in the limit @xmath13 ) do so due to their singular structure .",
    "they have poles ( the same as those for the dispersion relation of the damped harmonic oscillator described by the langevin equation minus the random force ) expressing the dissipation due to the damping .",
    "the surviving terms are the ones that do not carry the effect of the damping to the main propagator ( as shall be defined below , proportional to @xmath14 ) .",
    "the equilibrium distribution is obtained by summing over the non - vanishing terms .",
    "the we propose could be summarized as follows :    * laplace transform of the langevin equation and obtain @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; * laplace transform of the equilibrium distribution defined by equation  [ timeaverage ] ; * to eliminate the vanishing terms ( in the limit @xmath17 ) ; * to integrate over the the non - vanishing terms and obtain the equilibrium distribution .",
    "this method for obtaining the equilibrium distribution via time - averages , can be extended to different systems  .    as stressed above",
    ", an important aspect of the method is that it allows us to study time - dependent processes ( e.g. , equilibration ) , since the effect of time comes from a single propagator .",
    "the long - time behavior of any dynamical functions for the system are easily singled out in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the model . in sections",
    "3 we define , and laplace transform , the time - averaged equilibrium distribution . in section 4",
    "we discuss the irreversibility from the point of view of surviving and vanishing integrals .",
    "in section 5 we select the non - vanishing contributions and obtain the equilibrium distribution in an analytical form . in section 6 we make some concluding remarks .",
    "we model a brownian particle subject to a damped harmonic potential .",
    "the damping is proportional to the velocity .",
    "a langevin force @xmath7 , gaussian distributed , effectively acts on the brownian particle due to the interaction with the bath particles , not included in the dynamics .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 can be successfully laplace transformed into @xmath19 .",
    "the system obeys the following coupled langevin - like equations   is strictly of langevin type when the noise @xmath7 is white .",
    "a discussion on this can be found in reference  @xcite , chapter ix . ] : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath7 is a colored noise ( time - correlated ) distributed stochastic force .",

    "it is more general than white noise and reduces to it in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "some considerations have to be made about our choice of colored noise . for a closed system",
    ", noise has only internal causes . using projection operator techniques",
    "@xcite one obtains a generalized langevin equation  @xcite showing that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds near equilibrium and has to be consistent with a retarded dissipation of the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 however , we are assuming that the much simpler form of dissipation holds , namely eq .",
    "[ langevin ] .",
    "this can be justified by assuming that in a general situation ( far from equilibrium ) , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem does not apply and the dissipation s memory kernel and the fluctuation properties of the noise need not to be related  @xcite .",
    "a method for solving the fully retarded dissipation for arbitrary noise can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "another interesting situation is the case of purely external noise . in this case",

    "as for the noise properties , due to its gaussian nature , only the second order cumulant survives ( zero average distributed ) : @xmath47 @xmath48 as usual , for even @xmath49 we have : @xmath50 for all possible combinations for @xmath51 even ( it will have @xmath52 combinations of pairs of @xmath53 functions ) .    by laplace transforming , the @xmath54-average second cumulant reads : @xmath55 \\left[1-\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1-\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right]}\\right\\}-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-4.0cm}-\\frac{d\\tau}{2}\\left\\{\\frac{3 + \\tau\\left[i(q_i+q_j)+2\\epsilon\\right ] -\\tau^2(iq_i+\\epsilon)(iq_j+\\epsilon ) } { \\left[1-\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right]\\left[1+\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1-\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1+\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right]}\\right\\}.\\label{etaprop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "[ etaprop ] reduces to the white noise case @xmath56 as @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of time - correlated noise will affect the equilibrium distribution .",
    "as shall be seen , it has the effect of renormalizing the oscillator frequency .",
    "the white - noise equilibrium form is recovered when @xmath43 .",
    "a convenient way of defining the long - time limit ( @xmath57 ) for a convergent equilibrium distribution is to use @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",

    "[ peqexp ] might be carried through into the denominator of @xmath70 .",

    "a non - zero result can only be obtained , in the limit @xmath12 , when the sum of @xmath67 and @xmath68variable is completely eliminated from @xmath70 .",
    "when all variables are eliminated , we have instead @xmath76 , and the integral yields a non - zero contribution .    since the factors @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 are not coupled with the stochastic force @xmath77 , the @xmath67 and @xmath68variables associated with them will lead to residues only around the poles of the dispersion relation ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the pole s values will in the end be transported all the way to the denominator of the main propagator .",
    "so , by integrating over the poles of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , a non - zero final value to the summation @xmath79+(m+l)\\epsilon$ ] , will give a zero contribution in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this is the simple way by which irreversibility manifests itself on the path to equilibrium : the memory of the initial conditions is lost as the inverse laplace transform of terms such as @xmath80 where @xmath1 is an integer .",
    "the effect of poles from the dispersion relation in functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be eliminated since they are coupled with @xmath77-functions , which are associated with a factor @xmath81 dependency , coming from the stochastic properties of the @xmath77-functions .",
    "when we integrate over the @xmath67 and @xmath82 variables , the @xmath81 dependency eliminates the effect of these variables from the main propagator in the equilibrium limit @xmath74 .",
    "thus , only three possible couplings may contribute to the equilibrium distribution : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .    in the following we list the non - vanishing contributions to the equilibrium distribution p@xmath86 .",
