    "<S> we can further study the dependence of the polariton anharmonicites on the detuning @xmath87 , which we sweep by tuning the josephson energy @xmath38 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : defect_site](g ) , we show the anharmonicities of the transmon - like and phonon - like polaritons as a function of @xmath88 . at large detunings , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon mode is essentially linear and the transmon mode has an anharmonicity that asymptotes to its uncoupled value @xmath89 @xcite ( dashed black line in figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the two modes become close to resonant , the coupling between the transmon and phonon causes mixing between the modes and the phonon - like mode obtains a large kerr nonlinearity . both the value of the self - kerr ( @xmath90 ) and cross - kerr ( @xmath91 ) nonlinearities are plotted in fig  [ fig : defect_site](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the anharmonicitiy of the phonon mode is a quarter of the maximum transmon anharmonicity , as expected from a simple hybridization model , and this leads to a @xmath92 for the phonon - like mode near @xmath93 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have numerically shown that large coupling can be achieved between thin - film , small mode volume mechanical resonators and superconducting microwave quantum circuits despite their vastly different length scales . </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated a recipe for calculating these couplings for arbitrary phononic structures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to opening new ways of using acoustic devices in quantum circuits , we expect our results to be directly relevant to transducer designs for piezo - optomechanical devices currently being pursued for microwave to optical conversion  @xcite .    </S>",
