    "in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) the strong interaction among quarks depends on their color charge . when quarks are placed in a medium this color charge",
    "is screened with increasing density .",
    "the density can increase either by raising the temperature , so that collisions between quarks produce more quarks and gluons , or by compressing the system , thereby increasing the baryon density . if the density increases beyond a certain critical value one expects that the interactions between quarks no longer confine them inside a hadron , so that they are free to travel longer distances and deconfine .",
    "this transition from a confined to a deconfined phase is usually referred to as the _ deconfinement phase transition . _",
    "a separate phase transition takes place when the realization of chiral symmetry shifts from a nambu - goldstone phase to a wigner - weyl phase . in the massless quark limit",
    "this is achieved by the vanishing of the quark condensate , or alternatively the pion decay constant .",
    "qualitatively , one expects these two phase transitions to take place at approximately the same temperature .",
    "an outstanding issue is whether this conclusion also holds quantitatively . to address this",
    ", it has been customary to study the behavior of the order parameters of these transitions as functions of the temperature @xmath3 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath4 , namely the polyakov loop @xmath5  @xcite and quark anti - quark condensate @xmath6 in the chiral limit , respectively . in the confined phase the former parameter",
    "either vanishes in the limit of massless quarks , or else it is exponentially suppressed for finite quark masses , while it is finite in the deconfined phase . the quark condensate is finite in the confined phase , while it vanishes in the deconfined phase at high enough temperature , and in the limit of massless quarks . for finite quark masses chiral",
    "symmetry is explicitly broken at the lagrangian level and therefore the phase transition is suppressed .",
    "this is similar to what happens to a ferromagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field . in this situation",
    "one might need to specify to what extent one is still dealing with a phase transition .    at finite @xmath3 , and @xmath7 , lattice qcd calculations provide a consistent quantitative picture of the above behavior , resulting in similar critical temperatures @xmath8 for both transitions in the range @xmath9 mev @xmath10 @xmath11 mev , for finite quark masses  @xcite",
    "the situation is much less clear cut when both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are simultaneously non - zero .",
    "lattice qcd simulations can not be used for @xmath12 because the fermion determinant becomes complex and thus standard monte carlo methods fail , as the integrand is no longer real and positive definite .",
    "however , these techniques can still be adapted to extract some , though not exact , information on the qcd phase diagram for @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to resort either to mathematical constructions to overcome the above limitation  @xcite , or to model calculations  @xcite .",
    "of particular recent interest is the search for a possible critical end point  @xcite that signals the strengthening of the order of the transition with increasing @xmath4 , indicating the beginning of a true chiral symmetry restoring / deconfining phase transition .",
    "the results from monte carlo simulations and model calculations , with and without polyakov loop , or its variants , seem to be in conflict .",
    "in fact , the former give smaller ( larger ) values for the end point baryon chemical potential ( temperature ) than the latter .",
    "things become worse if one uses the imaginary chemical potential method , a well established technique for not too large values of @xmath4 . indeed , this leads to a shrinking and weakening region of chiral phase transitions with increasing @xmath4 , thus suggesting that there is no critical end point for @xmath13 mev  @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that even if the transition weakens with increasing @xmath4 , the existence of the critical end point would not be ruled out , although it would require a non - monotonic behavior  @xcite . in view of this situation , alternative ways of examining the qcd phase diagram",
    "are required .",
    "one possibility is to look at variables that describe deconfinement other than the polyakov loop .",
    "a phenomenological qcd parameter associated with deconfinement was first proposed long ago in @xcite , and it is the square energy ( @xmath14 ) beyond which the hadronic resonance spectral function becomes smooth and well described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . at @xmath15 this continuum threshold lies in the range @xmath16 , depending on the channel . at finite",
    "temperature one expects @xmath14 to decrease with increasing @xmath3 and approach the kinematical threshold at some critical value @xmath17 , to be identified with the deconfinement temperature . in this scenario one expects stable particles ( poles on the real axis in the complex squared energy @xmath18-plane ) to develop a width as a result of absorption in the thermal bath . at the same time , resonances ( poles in the second riemann sheet in the complex @xmath18-plane ) should develop @xmath3-dependent widths , increasing with increasing temperature . such a _ resonance broadening _",
    "mechanism was first proposed in detail in connection with dimuon production in heavy ion collisions @xcite .    the natural framework to determine @xmath14 has been that of qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "this quantum field theory framework is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances , extended beyond perturbation theory , and on cauchy s theorem in the complex @xmath18-plane .",
    "the latter is usually referred to as quark - hadron duality .",
    "vacuum expectation values of quark and gluon field operators effectively parametrize the effects of confinement .",
    "an extension of this method to finite temperature was first outlined in @xcite .",
    "further evidence supporting the validity of this program was provided in @xcite , followed by a large number of applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "of particular interest to the present work are the results obtained for @xmath19 in @xcite using qcd finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) for the ( light - quark ) axial - vector current correlator .",
    "the leading dimension fesr relates @xmath19 to the pion decay constant @xmath20 , and this in turn to the light - quark condensate ( using the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xcite ) . in the chiral limit",
    "it was found that @xmath21 , which holds to a very good approximation .",
    "this relation hints towards the possible coincidence of the critical temperatures for deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to finite density , thus obtaining @xmath22 from fesr using as input the light - quark condensate at finite temperature and density determined in the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) framework .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we find the relation between the quark condensate and the pqcd threshold @xmath14 using fesr for the axial - vector current correlator . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we compute the quark condensate at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 from a convenient parametrization of the quark propagator in the sde framework . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we present our analysis of the qcd phase diagram and show that the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration transitions take place at basically the same temperature to some @xmath23 accuracy , i.e. within the numerical precision of the method .",
    "we finally summarize and discuss our results in sec .",
    "we begin by considering the ( charged ) axial - vector current correlator at @xmath15 @xmath24     & = & - g_{\\mu\\nu } \\ ,",
    "\\pi_1(q^2 ) + q_\\mu q_\\nu \\pi_0(q^2 ) \\ ; , \\label{correlator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the axial - vector current , @xmath26 is the four - momentum transfer , and the functions @xmath27 are free of kinematical singularities . concentrating on the function @xmath28 and writing the ope beyond perturbation theory in qcd @xcite , one of the two pillars of the sum rule method , one has @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a renormalization scale , the wilson coefficients @xmath31 depend on the lorentz indices and quantum numbers of the currents and on the local gauge invariant operators @xmath32 built from the quark and gluon fields in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "these operators are ordered by increasing dimensionality and the wilson coefficients , calculable in pqcd , fall off by corresponding powers of @xmath33 .",
    "the unit operator above has dimension @xmath34 and @xmath35 stands for the purely perturbative contribution .",
    "hence , this ope factorizes short distance physics , encapsulated in the wilson coefficients , and long distance effects parametrized by the vacuum condensates .",
    "the second pillar of the qcd sum rule technique is cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy @xmath18-plane @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary analytic function , and the radius of the circle @xmath14 is large enough for qcd and the ope to be used on the circle ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the integral along the real @xmath18-axis involves the hadronic spectral function .",
    "this equation is the mathematical statement of what is usually referred to as _ quark - hadron duality_. using the ope , eq.([ope ] ) , and an integration kernel @xmath38 one obtains the fesr @xmath39 & - & \\frac{s_0^n}{n } \\left[1+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\alpha_s)\\right ] \\;\\ ; ( n=1,2,\\cdots ) \\;.\\label{fesr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath40 the dimension @xmath41 term in the ope does not involve any condensate , as it is not possible to construct a gauge invariant operator of such a dimension from the quark and gluon fields .",
    "nevertheless , it is a - priori conceivable to generate a @xmath41 term in some dynamical fashion , e.g. in pqcd at very high order ( renormalons ) .",
    "however , there is no evidence for such a term ( at @xmath15 ) from fesr analyses of experimental data on @xmath42 annihilation and @xmath43 decays into hadrons @xcite . at very high temperatures , though , there seems to be evidence for some @xmath41 term @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis to be reported here is performed at much lower values of @xmath3 , so that we can safely ignore this contribution in the sequel . + the extension of this program to finite temperature is fairly straightforward @xcite , @xcite , with the wilson coefficients in the ope , eq.([ope ] ) , remaining independent of @xmath3 at leading order in @xmath44 , and the condensates developing a temperature dependence .",
    "radiative corrections in qcd involve now an additional scale , i.e. the temperature , so that @xmath45 . this problem has not yet been solved successfully .",
    "nevertheless , from the size of radiative corrections at @xmath15 one does not expect any major loss of accuracy in results from thermal fesr to leading order in pqcd , as long as the temperature is not too high , say @xmath46 .",
    "essentially all applications of fesr at @xmath47 have been done at leading order in pqcd , thus implying a systematic uncertainty at the level of 10 % .",
    "one new feature at @xmath47 is the appearance of a new cut in the complex energy @xmath48-plane @xcite , and centered at the origin with extension @xmath49 .",
    "this is due to a contribution to the current correlator in the space - like region ( @xmath50 ) which vanishes at @xmath15 .",
    "conceptually , this originates in the scattering of the current by either quarks ( antiquarks ) or by hadrons in the medium , in the case of qcd or the hadronic representation , respectively . when considering the rest - frame ( @xmath51 ) this scattering term either becomes a delta function of the energy or it vanishes identically , depending on the channel . for instance , in the case of the axial - vector current correlator , eq.([correlator ] ) , the qcd scattering term is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding term in the hadronic representation is non - zero but it is suppressed relative to the tree - level pion contribution , as the axial - vector current can only couple to an odd number of pions .",
    "another new feature at finite temperature is the possible existence of non - scalar ( lorentz noninvariant ) vacuum condensates .",
    "this does not affect the present analysis , as we shall only consider dimension @xmath41 fesr .",
    "+ in the static limit ( @xmath51 ) , to leading order in pqcd , and for @xmath53 and @xmath54 the function @xmath28 in eq.([correlator ] ) becomes @xmath55 ; to simplify the notation we shall omit the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependence in the sequel . a straightforward calculation of the spectral function in perturbative qcd gives @xmath56 \\nonumber \\\\[.3 cm ]     & -&\\frac{2}{\\pi^2 } \\;t^2 \\;\\delta ( s)\\ ; \\left [     { \\mbox{li}}_2(-e^{\\mu_b / t } )     + { \\mbox{li}}_2(-e^{-\\mu_b / t})\\right ] , \\label{pertqcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the dilogarithm function , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the fermi - dirac thermal distributions for particles and antiparticles , respectively .",
    "we have assumed massless quarks , as quark mass corrections are negligible .",
    "however , later when we determine the quark condensate in section iii this approximation will be relaxed .    in the limit where @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 are large , eq .",
    "( [ pertqcd ] ) becomes @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ [ .3 cm ]     & + & \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\;\\delta ( s )     \\left(\\mu_b^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2t^2}{3 } \\right)\\;. \\label{pertqcdlargetmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the hadronic sector we assume pion - pole dominance of the hadronic spectral function , i.e. the continuum threshold @xmath14 to lie below the first radial excitation with mass @xmath61 .",
    "this is a very good approximation at finite @xmath3 , as we expect @xmath14 to be monotonically decreasing with increasing temperature . in this case , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pion decay constant at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath64 @xcite .",
