    "the history of glass formation strongly affects the relaxation dynamics of glassy materials @xcite .",
    "this dynamics is found to become slower with the `` age '' of the system , that means with the time @xmath5 expired since the material was brought into the glassy state .",
    "such aging phenomena have been identified in many systems and various dynamical probes .",
    "prominent examples are shear stress relaxations in structural glasses @xcite , thermoremanent magnetizations or a.c .",
    "susceptibility in spin glasses @xcite .",
    "similar effects have been observed on the dielectric constant of dipolar glasses @xcite , of structural glasses @xcite , and on the structure factor of lennard  jones systems @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments in colloidal gels @xcite or other ` soft glassy materials ' have been reported @xcite , and even electronic relaxations in anderson insulators were found to exhibit aging effects @xcite .",
    "aging is also expected for pinned systems ( pinned domain walls @xcite , pinned vortex lines @xcite ) , polymer melts @xcite and granular materials ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "several pictures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the simplest one is based on domain coarsening ideas @xcite , and is probably well suited to describe aging in , say , disordered ferromagnets where a well defined order wants to establish across the system .",
    "however , in spin glasses and even more evidently in glasses , the idea of some long range order which progressively invades the system is far from trivial .",
    "mean field models for spin glasses , which are formally equivalent to the mode coupling theory of glasses @xcite , do indeed lead to aging phenomena below the glass transition . in this case , aging is of geometric origin @xcite : as time grows , the system progressively exhausts the possibilities of lowering its energy , and finds itself around saddle points from which it is more and more difficult to escape .",
    "thermal activation is irrelevant in these models .",
    "although this picture might be justified for supercooled liquids _ above _ the mode - coupling temperature @xcite , it certainly breaks down at lower temperature , where activated events become dominant . in this regime",
    ", one expects that a coarse - grained dynamical model of thermally activated hops between metastable states is a proper description of the dynamics .",
    "in fact , recent md simulations support this view @xcite .",
    "landscape models have been widely discussed in the past @xcite , but their relevance for aging phenomena was recognized later @xcite .",
    "these later developments were recently extended to treat rheological phenomena @xcite .",
    "the ` trap ' models studied up to now lead to correlation or response functions that depend on the ratio @xmath13 of the observation time @xmath4 to the waiting time @xmath5 ( full aging ) , or , for long - range correlated energy landscapes , on the ratio @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , many experimental systems reveal _ subaging _ behavior , that is , the relevant variable is @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that there exist , for given waiting time @xmath5 , various scaling regimes in time @xmath4 , which are governed by _",
    "different _ relaxation times @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the occurrence of different scaling regions has recently been conjectured on the basis of analytical results for mean - field spin glass models @xcite .",
    "so far , however , it was not possible to illustrate intuitively these multiple time regimes by exact calculations on simpler models ( see however @xcite for an interesting discussion of these multiple time scales ) . in this paper we will discuss a model that allows us to demonstrate for the first time explicitly the possible occurrence of subaging behavior and multiple time scaling in a hopping model , where a point jumps among the deep ( free ) energy minima @xmath19 of a complex configuration space .",
    "some of the results discussed in this paper already appeared in a letter @xcite .",
    "slow dynamics in glasses is often attributed to a thermally activated motion of a point ( henceforth denoted as `` particle '' ) that jumps among metastable states in a rugged configuration space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : e - landscape ] ) . in a coarse grained description",
    ", only transitions between the deepest ( free ) energy minima @xmath19 will govern the dynamics at long times . according to extreme value statistics",
    "one may expect the distribution @xmath20 of these deep minima to be exponential ( which is the behavior of the tail of a gumbel distribution , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , mean - field theories of spin glasses @xcite and recent results from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite suggest this to be the case .    for simplicity , we consider the metastable states with lowest energies to be arranged on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath21 dimensions and refer to them as `` sites '' .",
    "the lattice here resembles an average finite connectivity of the mutually accessible states . to each lattice site @xmath22",
    "is assigned a random energy @xmath23 drawn from a distribution @xmath24 as discussed in a moment , @xmath25 corresponds to a `` glass transition temperature '' and we thus define @xmath26 as the rescaled temperature .",
    "also , energies are specified in units of @xmath25 .",
    "the particle can jump from one site @xmath22 to any of the @xmath27 nearest neighbor sites @xmath28 with a hopping rate @xmath29}{\\theta}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where the `` attempt frequency '' @xmath30 sets our time unit , and the parameter @xmath31 specifies how the energies of the initial and target site contribute to the saddle point energy being surmounted during a jump . in order for the @xmath32 to obey detailed balance",
    ", @xmath31 can assume any real value , but in a sense of a weighting of the initial and target energy we restrict @xmath31 to the range @xmath33 note that the case @xmath34 defines a trap model , where the jump rates depend on the initial energy only , while the case @xmath35 defines a `` force model '' , where the jump rates are determined by the energy difference between the two sites .",
    "due to the existence of very deep traps , the system exhibits a `` dynamical phase transition '' at the glass transition temperature @xmath36 : in the high  temperature regime @xmath37 the boltzmann distribution @xmath38 is normalizable , while in the low  temperature an equilibrium state does not exist . in this latter situation",
    "the system is exploring deeper and deeper traps as time proceeds and the overall dynamics ages .",
    "for the trap model ( @xmath39 ) the dynamics is fully characterized by the trapping times @xmath40 with distribution @xmath41 the absence of an equilibrium state for @xmath42 is reflected in the fact that the mean trapping time @xmath43 becomes infinite . for @xmath44 it is convenient to operate with the @xmath45 defined in ( [ eq : tau ] ) as well , although these @xmath45 no longer have the meaning of a trapping time . the hopping rate ( [ eq : wij ] )",
    "can then be written as @xmath46    at first glance the model defined here seems to be similar to the model considered earlier in @xcite .",
    "however , there is an important difference . in the model",
    "studied in @xcite the disorder is of `` annealed '' type , i.  e.  the energy of each site is drawn anew from @xmath20 after each jump .",
    "this can be viewed as a mean  field treatment and simplifies the problem to a great extent . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : annealedcase ] , in the annealed case one can map any parameters @xmath47 to parameters @xmath48 , that means the @xmath31 parameter is irrelevant . in the present model",
    "by contrast the energy disorder is `` quenched '' and such a mapping is not possible .",
    "we will show that this leads to the occurrence of much richer aging dynamics , including subaging behavior and generalized scaling forms .      for studying aging properties we consider a quench from @xmath49 to @xmath42 at time 0 , then wait for some time @xmath50 and ask for the behavior of correlation functions followed during an observation time @xmath4 after the waiting period .",
    "since the physical observables are functions of the coordinates of the configuration space , they will essentially de - correlate after the system has undergone a single transition from one deep minimum to another one .",
    "hence , a `` generic correlation function '' in the model is to consider the probability that the particle has not jumped between @xmath5 and @xmath51 .",
    "we denote this probability , after performing the disorder average , by @xmath2 .",
    "let us note that @xmath2 can also be regarded @xcite as the spin - spin - correlation function of the generalized sherrington - kirkpatrick model with @xmath52-spin interactions in the limit @xmath53 , which maps onto the random energy model @xcite .",
    "it can also be viewed as an incoherent intermediate scattering function at large wave numbers in diffusion processes @xcite .    a typical result for @xmath54 from continuous  time monte carlo simulations is shown in fig .  [ fig : afunscaled ] for parameters @xmath55 and different @xmath5 ( for details regarding the simulation see appendix [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can identify a pronounced aging phenomenon : the decay of @xmath2 with time @xmath4 becomes slower and slower with increasing waiting time @xmath5 .",
    "the linear behavior of the curves at long times in the double - logarithmic plot indicates a common asymptotic power ",
    "law decay , and suggests that the various curves may be collapsed onto a common master after rescaling the observation time @xmath4 by a proper function of the waiting time @xmath5 .",
    "the understanding of such scaling properties of @xmath54 when both @xmath4 and @xmath5 become large ( @xmath56 ) will be the central issue in the following .",
    "in the annealed case the model corresponds to a continuous  time random walk ( ctrw ) irrespective of the value of @xmath31 , since all times @xmath57 are drawn anew after each transition .",
    "the whole process can be characterized by a distribution @xmath58 of effective trapping times @xmath59 ( residence times between two transitions ) .    in order to calculate @xmath58 ,",
    "let us consider the particle to be at site @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath61 and the distribution is given by @xmath62\\ , \\delta\\left ( { \\tau_{\\text{eff}}}-      \\frac{\\tau_0^{1-\\alpha}}{\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{2d } \\tau_j^\\alpha }    \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\left [ \\prod_{i=0}^{2d } \\int\\limits_1^\\infty d\\tau_i\\ ,      \\rho(\\tau_i ) \\right]\\ , \\frac{{\\tau_{\\text{eff}}}^{\\alpha/(1-\\alpha)}}{1-\\alpha }      \\left [ \\sum_{j=1}^{2d } \\tau_j^{\\alpha }      \\right]^{1/(1-\\alpha ) } \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times\\ , \\delta\\left(\\tau_0 -        { \\tau_{\\text{eff}}}^{1/(1-\\alpha ) } \\left [ \\sum_{j=1}^{2d } \\tau_j^{\\alpha }        \\right]^{1/(1-\\alpha ) }   \\right)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath63 function contributes if @xmath64 , i.e.  there is no restriction for @xmath65 .",
    "hence , for @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68^{-\\theta'}\\rangle$ ] , and @xmath69 denotes an average over @xmath27 uncorrelated random numbers @xmath57 distributed according to ( [ eq : trapping - times ] ) .",
    "the ctrw theory applies with a rescaled temperature @xmath70 , and the aging properties of this model have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "note in particular that for @xmath71 no aging occurs , even if the distribution ( [ eq : normalization ] ) is not normalizable for @xmath72 .",
    "this , however , is nothing to worry about , since in the annealed model the energies change after each hop and the distribution ( [ eq : normalization ] ) does not correspond to an equilibrium distribution .",
    "the dynamical phase transition in the annealed model is defined by the diverging mean waiting time of the distribution @xmath58 that occurs for @xmath73 .",
    "the absence of aging for @xmath74 , that is when @xmath71 but @xmath75 , points to the fact that the annealed model may not provide a valid mean field description of the quenched model in any dimension @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : afanscaled ] the aging function @xmath2 is shown for the annealed model as resulting from simulations for two different parameters sets , @xmath76 and @xmath77 that both refer to the same @xmath78 .",
    "as expected , the aging functions for the two parameter sets are indistinguishable . moreover ,",
    "as predicted in @xcite , @xmath2 scales with @xmath13 , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : afanscaled]b ) and @xmath82 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : afanscaled]a ) .",
    "we will see in the following that this simple behavior does not hold true any longer in the quenched case .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath59 is the inverse hopping rate on a site , the formulae ( [ eq : taueff],[eq : taueff - dist ] ) will still be useful in the following .",
    "although full equilibrium can not be reached in a system of infinite size , there should be some equilibration on a local scale that corresponds to the region of configuration space being explored by the system after the quench .",
    "this is the idea of the pec .    in the present model",
    "we can translate this idea into a precise though approximate procedure for describing the aging process .",
    "after the waiting time @xmath5 , the particle has visited @xmath83 distinct sites and we will assume that on these sites the system has equilibrated .",
    "accordingly , the probability @xmath84 to find the particle on the site @xmath28 of the set of visited sites is @xmath85    the probability for the particle to remain on site @xmath28 for a time @xmath4 is @xmath86 , where the sum over @xmath87 runs over all nearest neighbor sites of @xmath28 . since the distinct visited sites form a brownian path in the lattice , which , on a local scale , has a one  dimensional topology , we will consider exactly two of the @xmath87 sites to belong to the path .",
    "the remaining @xmath88 sites are considered to be never visited until @xmath5 .",
    "it will turn out ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : exacteval ] ) that this assumption is not very important and that the aging properties would be mainly the same if the brownian path had a compact structure ( except for the asymptotics discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : l2limit ] ) . according to the pec",
    ", the aging function @xmath2 is now approximated by taking the average of @xmath89 over all visited sites @xmath28 with the weights @xmath84 , @xmath90 here @xmath69 denotes an average over @xmath91 uncorrelated random numbers @xmath57 that are distributed according to ( [ eq : trapping - times ] ) .",
    "we will see that @xmath92 and @xmath93 exhibit the same scaling properties , which in view of the generic character of @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "[ subsec : agingfunction ] ) are of primary interest for us here . in quantitative terms",
