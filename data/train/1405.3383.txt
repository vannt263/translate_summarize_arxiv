    "dom de caen ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 9 ) and @xcite ) posed the question whether connected graphs with three distinct eigenvalues have at most three distinct valencies . by eigenvalues of a graph",
    "we mean here the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix .",
    "more generally , one may wonder whether the number of distinct valencies in a graph is bounded by a function of the number of distinct eigenvalues .",
    "it is important to restrict to connected graphs because , for example , the disjoint union of the complete bipartite graphs on @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) vertices has three ( distinct ) eigenvalues and @xmath2 ( distinct ) valencies .",
    "hence the number of valencies can not be bounded as a function of the number of eigenvalues . instead of",
    "the adjacency eigenvalues , one may of course pose similar questions for other eigenvalues of graphs .",
    "it is for example known that connected graphs with three laplacian eigenvalues have at most two valencies ; see @xcite .",
    "mohar [ private communication ] observed that by adding one vertex and joining it in an arbitrary way to each of the components of the above graph , one obtains a connected graph with many valencies , but interlacing of eigenvalues ( see @xcite ) implies that the number of eigenvalues is at most seven .",
    "thus , it follows that with only seven eigenvalues , the number of valencies can be arbitrarily large .    in this paper , we will further exploit mohar s idea to construct connected bipartite graphs with five eigenvalues and arbitrarily many valencies . in the same spirit",
    ", we will construct connected non - bipartite graphs with five eigenvalues and many valencies .",
    "moreover , we will use regular two - graphs and seidel switching to construct connected graphs with four eigenvalues and many valencies .",
    "in particular , we shall use switching in the symplectic strongly regular graphs with respect to subgraphs that have many valencies .",
    "still , de caen s question remains open , as is the question whether there are connected bipartite graphs with four eigenvalues and more than four valencies .",
    "as a side result , we will show that if a graph in the switching class of a non - trivial regular two - graph is disconnected , then it must be the disjoint union of a strongly regular graph and an isolated vertex .",
    "also , if a graph in the switching class of a non - trivial regular two - graph has only three eigenvalues , then it must be regular , and hence strongly regular .",
    "for background on eigenvalues of graphs we refer to the monographs by brouwer and haemers @xcite and cvetkovi , doob , and sachs @xcite .",
    "let us first exploit mohar s construction further , in the sense that we want to bring the number of eigenvalues down from seven to five .    for every integer @xmath3 , there is a connected bipartite graph with five distinct eigenvalues and at least @xmath3 distinct valencies .",
    "consider the disjoint union of @xmath4 mutually non - isomorphic complete bipartite graphs with @xmath5 edges , with @xmath6 .",
    "then this graph has spectrum @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of vertices . if we now add a vertex and connect it in an arbitrary way to each of the components , so that the graph becomes connected , then the eigenvalues of the new graph and the eigenvalues of the original graph interlace @xcite , which implies that it has spectrum @xmath9 where we listed the eigenvalues in non - increasing order .",
    "so there are at most seven distinct eigenvalues , but still the number of valencies is at least about @xmath10 .",
    "however , the number of eigenvalues becomes even smaller if we connect the new vertex to all vertices of one color class of each of the bipartite components . in that case",
    "the graph remains bipartite , and it is easy to see that the rank of the adjacency matrix of the new graph is the same as that of the original graph .",
    "indeed , consider the incidence matrix between the bipartite color classes .",
    "then the extra row that corresponds to the new vertex is the sum of the other distinct rows .",
    "this implies that @xmath11 has multiplicity @xmath12 , hence @xmath13 , and the new graph only has five eigenvalues .",
    "note that @xmath14 because the graph is connected .    to prove the statement",
    ", we may take @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "now take , for example , @xmath16 , and start from @xmath17 complete bipartite graphs on @xmath18 vertices ( @xmath19 ) , to obtain a graph with at least @xmath3 valencies .",
    "is this the best we can do with bipartite graphs ?",
    "bipartite graphs with four eigenvalues are precisely the incidence graphs of so - called uniform multiplicative designs , see @xcite .",
    "examples of such graphs are known with up to four distinct valencies .",
    "the smallest of such examples is on @xmath20 vertices and is constructed from the fano plane .",
    "its spectrum is @xmath21 and its valencies are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , each occurring seven times .",
    "this graph is actually part of an infinite family of bipartite graphs with four eigenvalues and four valencies that can be obtained from a construction of non - normal uniform multiplicative designs by ryser @xcite .",
    "no examples of bipartite graphs with four eigenvalues and more than four valencies are currently known however .",
    "note that there is a strong resemblance between graphs with three eigenvalues and bipartite graphs with four eigenvalues , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following problem resembles de caen s problem on graphs with three eigenvalues .",
    "are there connected bipartite graphs with four distinct eigenvalues and more than four distinct valencies ?",
    "note that the above graphs with five eigenvalues can be interpreted as so - called coclique extensions of the spider graph .",
    "the spider graph with @xmath4 legs is a disjoint union of @xmath4 @xmath26s plus an extra vertex that is adjacent to one vertex of each @xmath26 ; it has spectrum @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , if we replace each vertex of this graph by several copies of this vertex , and let two copies be adjacent if and only if their originals are adjacent , then we obtain the required graph . in the adjacency matrix , this means that each zero is replaced by a block of zeros and each one by a block of ones , in such a way that the rank of the matrix does not change .",
    "hence this produces graphs with relatively small rank .",
    "it might in fact be fruitful to consider graphs with small rank and many vertices , as studied by akbari , cameron , and khosrovshahi @xcite and haemers and peeters @xcite .",
    "in the same spirit as above , we can construct non - bipartite graphs with five eigenvalues and arbitrarily many valencies .    for every integer @xmath28",
    ", there is a connected non - bipartite graph with five distinct eigenvalues and exactly @xmath3 distinct valencies .",
    "consider again the disjoint union of @xmath4 mutually non - isomorphic complete bipartite graphs with @xmath5 edges , with @xmath6 .",
    "take its complement @xmath29 , which is clearly connected and which has @xmath30 or @xmath10 valencies .",
    "let @xmath31 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath29 , then it is easy to see that @xmath32 has precisely @xmath10 distinct rows , and these are linearly independent",
    ". therefore @xmath29 has eigenvalue @xmath33 with multiplicity @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of vertices .",
    "it is also not so hard to see that @xmath29 has eigenvalues @xmath36 , each with multiplicity at least @xmath37 . indeed ,",
    "if a graph has eigenvalue @xmath38 with multiplicity @xmath39 , then its complement has eigenvalue @xmath40 with multiplicity at least @xmath41 , because the eigenspace of @xmath38 intersects the orthogonal complement of the all - ones vector in a subspace of dimension @xmath41 or @xmath39 , and the nonzero vectors in this intersection are easily seen to be eigenvectors of the complement of the graph .",
    "thus , the spectrum of @xmath29 is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the spectral radius , and @xmath44 is the remaining eigenvalue . by considering that @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( twice the number of edges of @xmath29 ) , it follows that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore @xmath49 and it can be shown that these are distinct from the other three eigenvalues of @xmath29 because @xmath50 ; we omit the technical details .",
    "so @xmath29 has a total of five distinct eigenvalues .    to prove the statement for @xmath15 we can , for example ,",
    "take @xmath16 , and take the complement of the disjoint union of @xmath17 complete bipartite graphs on @xmath18 vertices ( @xmath19 ) , to get a graph with exactly @xmath3 valencies .",
    "to finish the proof , we need non - bipartite graphs with five eigenvalues that have one and two distinct valencies ; examples are the hamming graph @xmath51 and the complement of @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we will use so - called regular two - graphs to construct ( connected , non - bipartite ) graphs with four eigenvalues .",
    "we will now recall some basics on two - graphs ; for more details we refer to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 be a graph with adjacency matrix @xmath31 .",
    "its seidel matrix @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a two - partition of the vertex set @xmath56 of @xmath29 .",
    "we say a graph  denoted by @xmath57  with the same vertex set as @xmath29 is obtained by seidel switching @xmath29 with respect to @xmath58 if two distinct vertices @xmath59 and @xmath60 are adjacent in @xmath57 precisely if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are adjacent in @xmath29 and either both are in @xmath61 or both are in @xmath62 , or if they are not adjacent in @xmath29 and one of them is in @xmath61 and the other one is in @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , the edges and non - edges between @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been switched .",
    "it is well - known that the spectra of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are the same .",
    "the switching class @xmath65 $ ] of @xmath29 is the set @xmath66 note that switching induces an equivalence relation on graphs , with switching classes as equivalence classes .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between switching classes of graphs and so - called two - graphs . for the sake of readability",
    "however , we will simply call the switching class a two - graph .",
    "we say that the two - graph @xmath65 $ ] is regular if the seidel matrix @xmath63 has exactly two eigenvalues .",
    "note that if the number of vertices of @xmath29 is at least two , then the seidel matrix @xmath63 has at least two eigenvalues .",
    "the regular two - graphs containing a complete graph or an empty graph are called trivial .",
    "the graphs in regular two - graphs are examples of so - called strong graphs .",
    "we are going to use these strong graphs to show that there are connected graphs with many distinct valencies and exactly four distinct eigenvalues .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a graph @xmath29 in a regular two - graph with @xmath35 vertices .",
    "let the seidel matrix of @xmath29 have distinct eigenvalues @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with respective multiplicities @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "first we will derive some more basic properties of @xmath29 .",
    "[ lemedge ] let @xmath29 be a graph in a regular two - graph with @xmath35 vertices and seidel eigenvalues @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with respective multiplicities @xmath69 and @xmath70 . if @xmath29 has @xmath5 edges , then the ( adjacency ) spectrum of @xmath29 is @xmath71 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not necessarily distinct from each other or @xmath72 or @xmath73 , and the following equations hold :    @xmath74    the adjacency matrix @xmath75 of @xmath29 has eigenvalue @xmath72 with multiplicity at least @xmath76 and eigenvalue @xmath73 with multiplicity at least @xmath77 because , similar as before , the eigenspaces of @xmath78 intersect the orthogonal complement of the all - ones vector in spaces of dimension at least @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "so we have two unknown eigenvalues , say @xmath43 and @xmath44 . but",
    "the sum of the eigenvalues ( @xmath79 ) equals zero and the sum of squares of the eigenvalues ( @xmath80 ) equals twice the number of edges .",
    "the given equations follow from these sums , and from using that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we also use the well - known fact that @xmath83 , which follows from the equation @xmath84 and the fact that the diagonal entries of @xmath85 are all @xmath86 .",
    "it follows in particular that , within the switching class @xmath65 $ ] , the spectrum of the graph is determined by the number of edges @xmath5 . because @xmath87 and the number of graphs in @xmath65 $ ] is @xmath88 , there are many graphs in the switching class that have the same spectrum .",
    "it is unclear , however , how many of these graphs are non - isomorphic .",
    "we will address this point in more detail after theorem [ thm:9 ] .",
    "we remark that for non - trivial regular two - graphs , the eigenvalues @xmath72 and @xmath73 can not be @xmath11 or @xmath33 , and the multiplicities @xmath69 and @xmath70 are larger than @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "* thm .  6.6 ) ) .",
    "we also note that if @xmath29 is regular , then all eigenvectors of @xmath78 are also eigenvectors of @xmath31 , and it follows that @xmath29 has at most three distinct eigenvalues , so if the regular two - graph is non - trivial , then @xmath29 is strongly regular . in the following",
    ", we will show that if @xmath29 is non - regular , then @xmath29 has four distinct eigenvalues .",
    "we will also show that @xmath29 can not be bipartite , but first , we will characterize the case that @xmath29 is disconnected .",
    "we note that by switching in any graph @xmath29 with respect to @xmath90 , where @xmath61 is the set of neighbors in @xmath29 of a given vertex @xmath91 , one can always isolate @xmath91 , in the sense that it has no neighbors , and hence the graph @xmath57 is disconnected .",
    "if the switching class is a regular two - graph , then it is well - known that @xmath57 is the disjoint union of a vertex and a connected strongly regular graph with parameters @xmath92 with @xmath93 , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , regular two - graphs are characterized by this property . in the following proposition",
    ", we will extend this result , in the sense that we will show that there can be no other disconnected graphs in the switching class .",
    "[ disco ] let @xmath29 be a disconnected graph in a non - trivial regular two - graph , with seidel eigenvalues @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath29 is the disjoint union of an isolated vertex and a connected strongly regular graph with parameters @xmath94 .",
    "consider one of the connected components on the set , say , @xmath95 of @xmath96 vertices , and let @xmath97 be the set of remaining @xmath98 vertices . then the seidel matrix @xmath78 partitions accordingly as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the @xmath101 all - ones matrix .",
    "since the seidel matrix satisfies , it follows by considering the upper right block that @xmath102 by considering a column of this equation , it follows that @xmath103 has constant row sum , say @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , it follows that @xmath105 has constant column sum , say @xmath106 .",
    "clearly , this means that the respective induced graph @xmath107 is regular with valency @xmath108 , for @xmath109 , respectively . by and",
    ", it follows that @xmath110 .",
    "note also that @xmath111 and @xmath112 are eigenvalues of @xmath113 , so they are contained in the spectrum @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath43 is an eigenvalue of @xmath114 and @xmath44 is an eigenvalue of @xmath115 , for otherwise the ` component ' not containing either of them has at most two distinct eigenvalues ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , but these are not @xmath11 or @xmath33 , which is a contradiction .",
    "so both @xmath114 and @xmath115 are regular graphs with at most three eigenvalues .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath115 must be connected ( recall that we already assumed that @xmath114 is connected ) , for otherwise it would have a connected component with at most two distinct eigenvalues @xmath72 and @xmath73 . because @xmath107 is @xmath116-regular",
    ", it follows that it has spectral radius @xmath116 , and hence @xmath117 , for @xmath109 .",
    "from the fact that @xmath118 , it now follows that @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 is a connected @xmath121-regular graph with at most three distinct eigenvalues , for @xmath109 .",
    "however , because @xmath33 is not an eigenvalue , neither component can be a clique with at least two vertices .",
    "now two cases remain .    first , if one of the two components , say @xmath115 , is an isolated vertex , then @xmath122 , and @xmath114 is a connected strongly regular graph with @xmath123 by . now denote the parameters of @xmath114 by @xmath124",
    ". then @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "secondly the case remains that both components are connected strongly regular graphs .",

    "but then @xmath131 , and so @xmath115 is disconnected , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus , this final case can not occur .",
    "we note that an alternative , more combinatorial , proof of this result is possible if one uses the above mentioned correspondence between regular two - graphs and strongly regular graphs .",
    "the given proof , however , is self - contained , and moreover establishes this correspondence .",
    "another consequence of the correspondence to strongly regular graphs is that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are integers , except ( possibly ) if @xmath132 , in which case @xmath72 and @xmath73 are equal to @xmath133 .",
    "[ prop3ev ] let @xmath29 be a graph with at most three distinct eigenvalues in a non - trivial regular two - graph , with seidel eigenvalues @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath29 is strongly regular with parameters @xmath134 or @xmath135 .    by the previous proposition ,",
    "@xmath29 must be connected , so the spectral radius has multiplicity one . consider the spectrum @xmath71 of @xmath29 , see lemma [ lemedge ] .",
    "by the assumption that @xmath29 has at most three distinct eigenvalues , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath136 or @xmath137 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath136",
    ". then @xmath138 by .",
    "because @xmath139 and @xmath140 , it follows that @xmath43 must be the spectral radius . because @xmath141 , where we used , it now follows that @xmath29 is regular .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is strongly regular , and its parameters @xmath135 follow in a straightforward manner . by interchanging the role of @xmath73 and @xmath72",
    "we obtain the other parameter sets in the statement of the proposition .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath137 .",
    "then @xmath142 by . in this case , assume ( without loss of generality ) that @xmath143 . then @xmath73 must be the spectral radius , and @xmath144 .",
    "but then @xmath145 , which is a contradiction .",
    "[ bipartite ] let @xmath29 be a graph in a non - trivial regular two - graph . then @xmath29 is not bipartite .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is bipartite . by the previous two propositions it follows that @xmath29 is connected with four distinct eigenvalues .",
    "from the bipartiteness , we have that its spectrum @xmath71 is symmetric about @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath146 or @xmath147 , then it follows that @xmath148 and @xmath149 , but then the equation @xmath150 from gives a contradiction .",
    "so @xmath151 and @xmath152 , and hence @xmath153 .",
    "however , the only regular two - graphs on four vertices are the trivial ones .    besides being of general interest , propositions [ disco]-[bipartite ]",
    "allow us to conclude that if we find graphs in regular two - graphs with more than two valencies , then they are connected , non - bipartite , and have four distinct eigenvalues .",
    "in the next section we will indeed construct such graphs , with arbitrarily many valencies .",

    "note that also the paley graphs of large enough order have the property that they contain all graphs on a given number of vertices as induced subgraphs ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "this follows in this particular case from the fact that @xmath165 is small compared to @xmath174 , so that in @xmath57 there is a unique vertex with valency @xmath165 , and its local graph is @xmath164 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in this context , it is good to mention that cioab , haemers , vermette , and wong @xcite recently showed that all friendship graphs except the one on @xmath185 vertices are determined by the spectrum .",

    "moreover , for most of the latter characterizations , seidel switching plays a key role . in general , however , we expect that almost all graphs with few ( say at most seven ) eigenvalues are not determined by the spectrum .",
    "we expect this even more for graphs with four eigenvalues of which two are simple . for the general question of which",
    "graphs are determined by the spectrum , we refer to @xcite .",

    "currently , we know only of finitely many connected graphs with three eigenvalues and three valencies .",
    "more specifically , spence ( see @xcite ) constructed an example on 24 vertices , de caen , van dam , and spence @xcite constructed examples on 36 and 43 vertices , and bridges and mena @xcite constructed examples on 46 and 97 vertices .",
    "let us see whether we can find an example with three eigenvalues and four valencies though .",
    "consider a connected graph with three distinct eigenvalues .",
    "as long as the number of distinct valencies is at most three , the partition of the vertices according to their valencies is equitable ( see @xcite ) , and this makes a search for putative parameter sets for such graphs easier .",
    "it is unclear whether the ` valency partition ' is equitable if the number of valencies is larger than three , or whether such graphs can exist at all . a putative parameter set with four valencies ( in fact , the one with the smallest number of vertices according to 15-year old , but unverified , computations ) is the following one on @xmath186 vertices and spectrum @xmath187 .",
    "the computations show that a graph with this spectrum must have valencies @xmath179 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , occurring @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath89 times , respectively .",
    "in fact , using the techniques of @xcite it can be shown that in this particular case , the valency partition is also equitable , with quotient matrix @xmath194 quite a bit of this graph is therefore determined . besides the trivial parts , one can show that the incidence structure between the five vertices of valency @xmath188 and @xmath193 vertices of valency @xmath189 is a @xmath195-@xmath196 design , and there is only one such design : three times the full design of all triples on five points . we leave it as a problem to the reader to finish the ( de-)construction .",
