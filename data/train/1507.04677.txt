    "recently , a large number of exoplanets have been found by various detection methods , and it have been learned that the exoplanets are rich in diversity .",
    "some of them have very small semi - major axes and masses that are similar to the jupiter , and they are known as hot jupiters .",
    "transit observations are a very useful method to know not only the radius of planets and their orbital period , but also information about their atmosphere .",
    "for example , transit observations in the uv band provide interesting physical properties of the upper atmosphere .",
    "absorption in the h ly@xmath1 have been confirmed in some hot jupiters , such as hd 209458b @xcite , hd 189733b @xcite , and 55 cnc b @xcite .",
    "the transit depth corresponds to the apparent radius of planets .",
    "while the transit depth in optical wavelength at hd 209458b is @xmath2 1.5% , that corresponds to @xmath2 1.38 @xmath3 , the transit depth in the h ly@xmath1 line is @xmath2 15% , that corresponds to @xmath2 4.3 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena are reported at hd 189733b @xcite , and a hot neptune , gj 436b @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the existence of the extended exosphere that is filled up with the high - temperature atomic hydrogen gas , and mass loss takes place .",
    "heavier elements such as c , o , si , and mg are also detected in the uv band in the escaping atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the detailed mechanism of the strong mass loss from hot jupiters is still unclear , various theoretical models have been developed .",
    "a leading example of them is that energy - limited escape by x - ray and extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) from a central star , so - called xuv - driven escape @xcite .",
    "the xuv - driven escape have been studied by various ways ; for example , including chemical reactions @xcite , considering radiation pressure on the escaping atmosphere and the charge exchange between neutral particles in the escaping atmosphere and protons in the hot stellar wind @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is suggested that xuv - driven escape can occur not only in hot jupiters but also in cooler planets .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that hydrodynamic escape driven by xuv can take place at the gaseous planets that orbit beyond 1 au in some cases if the central stars are active in the x - ray .",
    "furthermore , physical properties and phenomena related to magnetic fields of exoplanets have been investigated in more detail by both theoretical and observational studies . for the theoretical works , for example",
    ", @xcite suggested outflow from the upper atmosphere will be magnetically - controlled , thus the outflow becomes asymmetric and a mass - loss rate can be smaller about an order of magnitude than the value without the magnetic fields , that is based on the assumption of the spherical symmetric wind .",
    "also , models of the upper atmosphere with the planetary magnetic fields are proposed and the effects on transit depth and the loss of the angular momentum by the planetary magnetic fields were discussed @xcite . recently , magnetic activities of exoplanets have been observed , and several works suggested that the strength of the magnetic fields of hot jupiters seems to be smaller than that of jupiter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    we have also investigated magnetically - driven mass loss from gaseous planets by extending mhd simulations for winds from stars with surface convection , e.g. solar wind @xcite",
    ". waves , which are excited by turbulence at the surface , transport the energy upward .",
    "they heat up the upper atomosphere and drive outflows .",
    "however , in this paper we assumed the ideal mhd approximation , which should be modified to take into account effects of the weak ionization in the planet atmopshere . in this paper , we study non - ideal mhd effects by considering the magnetic diffusion in partially - ionized atmospheres .",
    "we explain our concept of the simulations and numerical method , and several formulae for analysis in section [ model_description ] .",
    "then we show results on the structure of atmopsheres and outflows by inspecting roles of the magnetic resistivity in the propagation and dissipation of waves in section [ results ] . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss effects of ohmic dissipation in the atmosphere and effects of geometry of the magnetic flux tubes . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize the results and refer to our future works .",
    "in this work we use a numerical simulation code that is originally developed for the calculation of the acceleration of solar wind @xcite . at the surface of stars , various types of magnetic waves",
    "are excited @xcite .",
    "the excited waves propagate upward from the surface , then heat up the coronal region and drive the stellar wind by various dissipation processes of the waves @xcite .",
    "it is thought that the wave is especially important for the transfer of the energy .",
    "this mechanism of the energy transport from the surface to the upper atmosphere can be applied for objects that have their own magnetic field .",
    "although details are uncertain , hot jupiters are expected to have magnetic fields , so this mechanism is applicable to hot jupiters . in our previous research , we have extended the simulation code to calculate the atmospheric escape from gaseous planets , especially from hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "in addition , this mechanism is applied for the calculation of the structure of the atmosphere of brown dwarfs , and it is implied that the heating by the dissipation of mhd waves is also important for the brown dwarfs atmosphere @xcite .    as for our mhd simulations we basically follow @xcite , except that we consider magnetic diffusion ; we solve time - dependent equations and treat the propagation and dissipation of the mhd waves in a super - radially open magnetic flux tube in the atmosphere .",
    "we adopt the same functional form for the super - radial expansion factor , @xmath4 , as in @xcite , which was originally introduced by @xcite .",

    "the effect of the super - radial expansion of the magnetic flux tubes appears as the factor @xmath25 . note that the term with @xmath22 in the energy equation ( [ eq : ene ] ) indicates joule ( ohmic ) heating and the term with @xmath22 in the induction equation ( [ eq : ind ] ) denotes diffusion of magnetic field lines .",
    "the most dominant origin of the magnetic resistivity in the atmosphere of hot jupiters is the collision between electrons and neutral particles .",
    "in such circumstances the magnetic resistivity @xmath22 depends on gas temperature and an ionization degree as follows ; @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ionization degree ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath28 is number density of electrons , and @xmath29 is that of neutral and ionized hydrogen . if the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : ind ] ) is dominant over the first term , that is , the magnetic resistivity is large , the magnetic waves will diffuse out . since the gas temperature and ionization degree will be low in the atmosphere of planets , the magnetic resistivity might not be negligible . therefore , the resistive mhd calculation is needed to evaluate the non - ideal effects on the structure of the atmosphere and the mass loss .",
    "ionization degrees are determined by a method originally developed for betelgeuse by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the solar abundance gas @xcite , and calculate the ionization and recombination of h , c , na , mg , al , si , s , ca , fe , and k in the gas phase .",
    "since the typical surface temperature of hot jupiters is @xmath2 1000 k and it is low to ionize hydrogen , heavy elements such as na and k are the dominant ionizing sources in the lower atmosphere .    the inner boundary of the simulations is set at the photosphere in the solar and stellar wind calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we set the inner boundary at the position where @xmath30 .",
    "we fix the temperature at the inner boundary , and it is treated as a parameter . the density at the inner boundary is determined by the given temperature and @xmath31 . the outer boundary radius is set to 360 planetary radii , and the number of the grids is 6000 . in the most inner region , @xmath32 corresponds to 0.0001 planetary radii , and @xmath32 increases gradually as the distance from the surface .",
    "we set the planet mass to be the jupiter mass throughout this paper .",
    "we inject velocity perturbations at the inner boundary , which excite upward propagating waves , and their value is treated as a parameter . in most cases ,",
    "amplitude of the injected perturbations is 20 % of the sound speed at the surface . in the case of the sun ,",
    "the velocity dispersion at the surface is caused by surface convection .",
    "on the other hand , several previous works have suggested that the convective - radiative boundary lies deep region of the atmosphere(e.g .",
    "however , three - dimensional calculations of the atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters suggest the existence of supersonic equatorial flow(e.g .",
    "therefore , it is expected that turbulence can be created at the surface by the strong wind .",
    "we assume a broadband spectrum of the perturbations in proportion to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is frequency of perturbations . to solve the mhd equations ,",
    "we adopt a second - order godunov scheme with the method of characteristics @xcite .",

    "we discuss the dependence of the atmospheric structure on these parameters . to evaluate them ,",
    "we introduce the scale height of the atmosphere .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium of the atmosphere is @xmath38 @xmath39 is the mass of a planet .",

    "the dissipation of the waves is done by the nonlinear mode conversion .",
    "the fluctuations of the magnetic pressure associated with the waves excite compressive waves .",
    "these waves are eventually steepen to shocklets , which finally dissipate and heat the surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "this process has been examined in terms of the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "recently , a radio observation by jaxa s spacecraft _ akatsuki _ actually reveals radial distribution of compressive waves in the solar corona , which supports this scenario @xcite .    in the resistive mhd simulations , the magnetic diffusion also contributes to the dissipation of mhd waves .",
    "when @xmath35 is lower , the dissipation of mhd waves in the low altitude where the magnetic resistivity is high affects the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , an energetics argument of propagating mhd waves in the resistive mhd condition is important to understand the properties of the atmospheric structure and mass loss .",
    "to evaluate the propagation , reflection , and dissipation of the wave energy in the atmosphere , we summarize the poynting flux carried by waves below .",
    "the net poynting flux arising from magnetic tension , which represents the energy flux of waves measured from the comoving frame , can be written as follows ; @xmath48 the poynting flux can be divided into an outward ( parallel with @xmath49 ) part and an inward ( antiparallel with @xmath49 ) part @xcite . in order to evaluate the inward and outward flux",
    ", we introduce elssser variables , @xmath50 by using the elssser variables , the net poynting flux is @xmath51 in this equation , @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to the outward and inward components of the poynting flux , respectively .",
    "although in our simulations we inject the outward component of waves from the surface , the waves are eventually reflected inwardly .",
    "in resistive mhd simulations , the propagation and dissipation of mhd waves are affected by magnetic diffusivity , and accordingly the atmospheric structure would be modified .",
    "we compare the ideal mhd and resistive mhd calculations , and investigate how the magnetic diffusion affects the structure of planetary atmospheres and outflows .",

    "note that all atmospheric structures in this paper are time - averaged , and all properties have large time variability .",
    "the gas density in the upper atmosphere decreases more gradually in the ideal mhd cases because a larger amount of alfvenic wave energy can reach the upper atmosphere and lifts up the gas by the magnetic pressure associated with the waves . on the other hand , in the resistive mhd cases waves",
    "are damped in the cool atmosphere at low altitudes because of the high resistivity , and then , the gas density sharply drops without the support from the magnetic pressure .",
    "the waves that enter the upper atmosphere contribute to the acceleration of planetary winds .",
    "the wind speeds are quite slow in the resistive mhd cases , while the wind are accelerated to several tens of kilometer per second in the ideal mhd cases . as a result ,",
    "the mass - loss rates in the resistive mhd cases are much smaller than those in the ideal mhd cases , because the density in the upper atmosphere is around two orders of magnitude less than that of the ideal mhd cases , and the velocity is also much smaller .",
    "if a planet is isolated or have a large distance from the central star , the planetary wind does not stream out in the resistive mhd condition except for intermittently driven outflows observed in the simulations because the average velocity is smaller than the escape velocity . however , if the planet is a hot jupiter having small semi - major axis , the gas overflows easily from the small roche lobe and is blown away by the stellar wind from the central star .",
    "in contrast to the large difference in the @xmath11 and @xmath54 profiles , the temperature structures of the resistive and ideal mhd cases are not so different each other . although the locations of the temperature inversion are slightly different , the upper atmospheres are heated up to @xmath55 in both ideal and resistive mhd cases . therefore , the heating by the dissipation of mhd waves is still important in the atmospheres of the resistive mhd cases .",
    "we show the relation between the surface temperature , @xmath56 , of gaseous planets and the atmospheric structure , and then we discuss the dependence of the mass - loss rate . in this subsection",
    "we fix the radius to the jupiter radius and the amplitude of the velocity dispersion to 20% of the sound speed at the surface .",
    "therefore , larger @xmath57 corresponds to larger mhd wave energy that is deposited to the magnetic flux tube .",
    "@xmath57 is thought to be mainly determined by the irradiation from the central star , more specificly , determined by the combination of the effective temperature of the central star and the semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "this implies that , in the framework of the wave - driven planetary winds , when we take planetary systems that have a similar central star , properties of the mass loss from hot jupiters strongly depend on the distance from a central star .",

    "as shown in figure [ temp - temp ] ( a ) , the altitude of the temperature inversion is higher for higher @xmath35 .",

    "@xmath57 , the density in the upper atmosphere is higher because of the larger scale height ; the density decreases more gradually with altitude ( equation ( [ densitystructure ] ) ) .",

    "the higher @xmath35 cases have smaller ohmic heating rate in the lower atmosphere , but it reverses in the upper atmosphere , because the dissipation of the waves is more gentle at low altitudes in these cases and a larger amount of the wave energy reaches the upper atmosphere .",
    "in addition , as shown in the figure [ temp - ionresis ] , the magnetic reynolds number is relatively lower in the upper atmosphere for higher @xmath57 , which further increases the resistive heating .",
    "however , the ohmic heating rate is quite small in comparison to the shock heating except for the region closed to the surface ( fig . [ ohmiccomp ] ) , so this effect is negligible in the upper atmosphere and gives little contribution to the atmospheric escape . even in the low atmosphere where the ohmic heating is large ,",
    "it does not play a primary role . the comparison between the ideal and non - ideal calculations in figure [ comparison ] ( a ) shows that the temperature profiles in the lower atmosphere are almost same . in fact , the temperatures in the lower atmosphere in the resistive cases are barely higher than the ideal cases and the difference is only several tens of kelvin . in summary ,",
    "the ohmic heating does not play important roles in the entire structure of the atmosphere and the atmospheric escape .      in this work and the previous work ,",
    "we have fixed the shape of the open magnetic flux tube that is described in section [ numerical_method ] .",
    "we presume that the overall structure of magnetic field lines of gaseous planets is similar to that of the sun .",
    "the sun has a multipole magnetic field and the properties of open magnetic flux tubes are observed in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the actual structures of magnetic field in exoplanets are unknown .",
    "the overall structure of the planetary magnetic field affects the shape of the open magnetic flux tube .",
    "the most critically affected parameter in our modeling is the filling factor @xmath121 ( see equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "if the planetary magnetic field has a simple dipole structure , open magnetic flux tubes appear in the magnetic polar regions . in this case ,",
    "heating in the upper atmosphere and the acceleration of gas flow by mhd wave energy occur only in the polar regions .",
    "therefore , the actual appearance of flow is expected to be bipolar . in the simple dipole case of the magnetic field ,",
    "the degree of super - radial expansion of the open magnetic flux tube should be smaller , and thus the mass - loss rate is expected to be smaller because the reflection of the energy flux is expected to be enhanced . to investigate this more quantitatively ,",
    "a three - dimensional calculation is required , which remains difficult at present .",
    "on the other hand , the observation of the bipolar outflow from an exoplanet is , in principle , possible in the detailed analysis of the differential spectroscopy for transiting hot jupiters , unless the magnetic dipole axis is perpendicular to both the orbital plane of the exoplanet and the line - of - sight .",
    "this is because a blue - shifted outflow before ingress and a red - shifted outflow after the emersion , or vice versa , can be seen in this case .",
    "once the mass flux of the bipolar outflow from the exoplanet is observed , we will possibly constrain the property of magnetic field of the exoplanet by assuming the driving mechanism as described in this work .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , high energy radiation such as x - ray and extreme ultraviolet from a central star is important for the heating of upper atmosphere and atmospheric escape from hot jupiters .",
    "here we compare the height where the heating by mhd waves is important and the penetration depth of stellar xuv .",
    "it is useful to introduce @xmath122 , the radius at which xuv is absorbed .",
    "@xmath122 means that the optical depth for xuv reaches unity at that radius , and it corresponds to the radius where the column density of hydrogen becomes @xmath123(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate @xmath122 in each calculations and compare it with the region where the heating by the dissipation of the mhd waves becomes important .     on @xmath35 and comparison with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the black squares with the solid line corresponds to @xmath122 , the circles with the dashed line and the triangles with the dotted lines correspond to @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath126 , @xmath103 , and @xmath112 for this comparison . ]",
    "figure [ rxuv ] shows @xmath35 dependence of @xmath122 and comparison with other considerable radii .",
    "as shown in figure [ temp - temp](a ) , the gas temperature slightly drops due to adiabatic expansion and then heated drastically to @xmath92 k. @xmath124 is the radius at which the temperature become lowest and heating by mhd waves starts to become important , and @xmath125 is the radius at which the temperature become higher than 8000 k. in this range of @xmath35 , @xmath122 always locates only slightly above @xmath124 and the value varies between @xmath127 .",
    "this is consistent with previous works on the xuv heating in the atmosphere of hot gaseous planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xmath125 always lies much higher altitude than @xmath122 .",
    "these result suggest that the region heated to @xmath92 k by the dissipation of the mhd waves is optically thin to xuv photons , and xuv can reach the altitude that the temperature becomes lowest in our model .",
    "photo - ionization , cooling from metal lines , lyman @xmath1 play important roles in the upper atmosphere of hot jupiters . at this stage",
    ", our model does not include the effects of stellar xuv irradiation , the inclusion of which should improve our model . in the present modeling , the results can not explain the observational results of the mass - loss rates adequately , since the mass - loss rates are reduced largely when we take into account the effects of the magnetic resistivity .",
    "this seems to indicate that the resulting mass - loss rate strongly depends on the details of the input physics .",
    "more realistic calculation is critically needed , and will be out future work .",
    "we have studied the structure of the atmosphere and the wind of hot jupiters by non - ideal mhd simulations , particularly focusing on the effects of the magnetic diffusion .",
    "the waves generated from the surface are strongly damped via resistive dissipation in the weakly - ionized atmosphere at low altitudes and only a tiny fraction of the initial energy can reach the upper atmosphere .",
    "consequently , the mass - loss rate is reduced significantly , compared to that obtained from the ideal mhd simulations .",
    "however , the waves that survive to transmit into the upper atmosphere still support the temperature inversion and heat up to @xmath128 k by the wave dissipation ; the waves are still important in determining the temperature profile even though the magnetic diffusion is taken into account .",
    "we would like to note that the wave heating here is not owing to ohmic heating but the consequence of the shock dissipation of the compressive waves that are nonlinearly excited from the waves .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of atmospheric properties on the surface temperature , the planet radius , and the velocity dispersion at the surface .",
    "we found a nonmonotonic dependence of the poynting flux on the surface temperature ( figure [ temp - poynting ] ) , because the resistivity , which controls the dissipation of the waves , is determined globally the density and temperature of the atmosphere .",
    "we point out that the heating and acceleration of gas will take place in magnetic polar regions if the planetary magnetic field is simple dipole structure , and non - spherically symmetric bipolar outflow will takes place .    in our calculations ,",
    "the treatment of the radiative cooling is simplified especially for low temperature gas ( see discussion part of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a more accurate treatment is needed for future investigation and now we are going to improve this part .",
