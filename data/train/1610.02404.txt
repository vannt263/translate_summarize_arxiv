    "dust plays an important role in galaxies as a catalyst for instellar chemistry , a repository of metals , and a heat source for interstellar gas . the discovery that there is about as much dust outside of galaxies as within @xcite suggests that dust also plays an important role in the disk - halo cycle ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* who argue for a smaller amount of halo dust ) .",
    "dust is primarily formed in the atmospheres of evolved stars or supernova remnants , so extragalactic dust was likely transported out of the disk by gaseous flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , dusty outflows have been detected around edge - on galaxies , including filaments seen in extinction @xcite and dust emission at several kpc above the midplane @xcite .",
    "still , it remains unclear how and when the dust gets into the halo , how long it remains there , and whether it is altered in the process .",
    "these issues motivate further studies .",
    "extragalactic dust can be studied through extinction , emission , or reflection ( scattering ) . in the first case",
    ", extraplanar dust lanes can be seen against the thick disk of stellar light @xcite , but above a few kpc from the galaxy midplane the extinction must be measured toward background continuum sources , such as quasars . since there are few quasars behind any one galaxy , @xcite stacked many sources to measure the extinction to beyond 1mpc .",
    "in contrast , thermal emission or reflection will only be seen near the galaxy , since both processes need a nearby light source .",
    "this makes edge - on systems the ideal laboratories to isolate extraplanar dust emission and scattered light .",
    "the possibility of extragalactic reflection nebulae ( ern ) around edge - on galaxies was raised by @xcite , and @xcite reported the discovery of diffuse ultraviolet ( uv ) light consistent with an ern above the disks of the edge - on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc  253 .",
    "this conclusion was reinforced by @xcite , and @xcite detected a uv halo around ngc  891 that they argue is also an ern . in (",
    "* hereafter , hkb14 ) we reported that uv halos are ubiquitous around highly inclined galaxies , but @xcite pointed out that the light scattered into the wings of the point - spread function ( psf ) can masquerade as a physical halo .",
    "@xcite modeled several of the galaxies in including this effect , and found that some of the uv halos we had reported are astrophysical while others are artificial . in principle , ern are visible at other wavelengths , and some of the h@xmath1 attributed to extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( edig ) may actually be reflected light @xcite .",
    "however , uv halos are especially promising because the scattering cross - section is high in the uv for typical dust compositions and the sky is relatively dark .",
    "in we examined galaxies with both _ swift _",
    "uvot @xcite and _ galex _",
    "@xcite observations , regardless of physical properties . in a series of three papers",
    "we now take a more systematic approach to measuring the physical properties of the uv halos around highly inclined spiral galaxies . in this paper ( paper  i )",
    "we focus on galaxies within about 25mpc to determine the frequency of physical uv halos , their morphology , and whether they are ern .",
    "the subsequent papers will present a catalog of total halo fluxes for a wider sample where morphology can not necessarily be measured ( paper  ii ) , and models of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for those galaxies with the highest quality data ( paper  iii ) .",

    "our reliance on archival data means that the sensitivity and filter coverage vary widely among the galaxies .",

    "we want to obtain accurate 2d maps of the halo rather than only a profile along the minor axis , so the typical approach of convolving a model with the psf is not sufficient .      the _ galex _ and _ swift _ calibration teams have provided psfs measured to radii of about 60 and 30 arcsec , respectively , but for the galaxies in this work the psfs need to extend to 200 - 600arcsec . extrapolating the wings from the available psfs may not be sufficient , so we measured psfs from bright point sources to better characterize the wings .    for _ galex",

    "the actual psf is not azimuthally symmetric , but simulations show that unless it is very asymmetric ( to an extent that would be noticeable on the image ) , this approximation does not noticeably change the measured psf - wing contamination for any galaxy with a projected size of about an arcminute or more ( even at smaller sizes , it will not usually make a difference ) .",
    "the background level is crucial to measuring the small amount of light scattered by the psf to large radii , so we masked all point sources detected using the _ swift _ task uvotdetect with a 3@xmath9 detection threshold ( based on sextractor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) other than the target .",
    "since these sources are _ much _ fainter than the target , we assume that masking to the nominal 99% encircled energy radius is sufficient .    the measured profiles are shown in figure  [ figure.extrapolated_psfs ] , along with fitted profiles of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath3 , and @xmath14 are determined using least - squares fits to the data between the dashed vertical lines in figure  [ figure.extrapolated_psfs ] ( in each plot , @xmath3 has been subtracted ) . for comparison , we also plot a fitted profile where @xmath15 .",
    "the extrapolation based on the best - fit model begins at the midpoint between the dashed vertical lines , but our results are insensitive to where we match the extrapolated profile to the measured one .",
    "the fuv is close to @xmath16 at all radii , but the other filters concentrate light within about 30arcsec , with the subsequent decay being steeper than @xmath16 .",
    "the best - fit exponents are given in table  [ table.psf ] .",
    "the fit depends strongly on @xmath3 , so we verified that the background level in the fitting zone was consistent with the background measured outside the fitting zone .",
    "we also repeated the analysis using a 2@xmath9 threshold for point source removal and measured @xmath14 values that are consistent with the earlier measurements .",
    "finally , we verified that the psfs successfully clean the outer regions in the source images and other images of bright point sources ( within @xmath1710arcsec an azimuthally symmetric psf is a poor match to the data ) .",
    "there are two caveats to this analysis .",
    "first , the psf becomes increasingly distorted with increasing distance from the optical axis , so for images `` far '' from the optical axis the assumption of radial symmetry is badly wrong ( where the critical distance depends on the instrument ) .",
    "the psf is naturally hard to measure to large radii far from the optical axis , and there are few bright sources that are both near the chip edge and have very deep _ galex _ or _ swift _ data .",
    "thus , for galaxies near the chip edge the measured psfs may not accurately account for the psf - wing contamination .",
    "lclc fuv & @xmath18 & _ uvm2 _ & @xmath19 + nuv & @xmath20 & _ uvw1 _ & @xmath21 + _ uvw2 _ & @xmath19 &    second , the psf may vary with time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* although the variability is probably much larger for ground - based instruments ) .",
    "we could not make useful tests with _ galex _ data because the bright sources we used for comparison typically had different psf cores that were obviously due to the different positions on the chip . for _ swift _ we selected all exposures of mrk  501 in a given filter where the source was within 1arcmin of the chip center , and searched for variability in the best - fit @xmath14 between combined images taken in different months .",
    "we found no clear variability , but some low level of variability beyond 50arcsec is possible .",
    "we note that the _ swift _ psf _ core _ does vary with time in the sense that the full - width at half maximum depends on the temperature of the uvot focusing rods .",
    "however , we did not find any variation in the best - fit exponent for the psf wings .",
    "our results are consistent with the best - fit exponents found in other sources where the psf can not be measured to such large distances , so we believe that the fits are reasonably accurate .",
    "we estimated the psf - wing contamination for each image by creating a model using the input image and the extrapolated psf models , using the best - fit exponent for each filter ( table  [ table.psf ] ) .",
    "we first clipped the input image to the region that just contains the galaxy .",
    "we did not use an objectively defined region because of the varied disk morphologies and inclinations in our sample , but the galaxy regions are conservative in that they extend to at least 2kpc above the midplane .",
    "we then convolved the clipped image with a psf model that was extrapolated to at least twice the angular diameter of the galaxy .",
    "the resulting image shows the amplitude of the psf - wing light at each position around the galaxy , but the total flux in the model image is too low and the light is too smeared out because we do not deconvolve the galaxy image before convolving it with the extrapolated psf ( the galaxy is too complex for accurate deconvolution ) .",
    "the former effect is corrected by multiplying the fake image by the ratio of the flux in the galaxy in the original and fake images ( this is not an exact correction , but simulations of exponential disk models show that it underestimates the psf - wing flux by much less than the statistical uncertainties for our sample ) . the latter effect can not be easily corrected , but we find ( again using simulations of exponential disk models ) that the most severe impact is within about 10 pixels of bright regions in each galaxy , and in practice the galaxy regions we define extend at least this far from bright clumps .",
    "the combination of these issues leads to an overestimate of the psf - wing contamination by about 10% immediately adjacent to the galaxy , and which quickly declines with height .",
    "we also investigated the error due to using a symmetric psf in the fuv , where the psf is measured to over 100arcsec .",
    "we convolved model images with angular sizes smaller than this with our model psfs and the measured psf .",
    "this leads to differences of 0 - 3% in the psf - wing light measured around the galaxy .",
    "on the scale of the whole halo , these effects are very modest",
    ".    the model image can then be used in conjunction with the original image to measure the psf - wing contamination at any point in the halo , and we also subtract the model from the original to create corrected halo images . the psf - wing contamination differs for each galaxy and filter , but it ranges from 1 - 90% of the total extraplanar flux in our sample .",
    "the contamination is generally larger in the fuv than the other filters .",
    "the importance of the correction is illustrated in figure  [ figure.before_after ] for ngc  3079 , where we show fuv images before and after subtracting the model image .",
    "we verified the @xcite proposition that convolving the galaxy image with a psf extrapolated to more than twice the angular size of the galaxy does not significantly alter the psf - wing contamination . in section  [ section.fluxes ] we assess the reliability of our psf - wing subtraction .",
    "in this section we describe the qualitative structure of the diffuse extraplanar uv light in our sample and compare it to the diffuse structure seen at other wavelengths where the source of the light is basically understood . the initial work on uv halos @xcite focused on galaxies with galactic superwinds , and in this section",
    "we divide our sample into galaxies with known winds ( starburst galaxies ) and those without ( normal galaxies ) .",

    "for example , in the _",

    "this may indicate residual light in the central 2arcmin halo ring in the large - scale _ uvw2 _ scattered - light artifact , which could mimic a halo in an image centered on the galaxy .",
    "the smaller field of view of the uvot can also lead to differences : in the relatively shallow uvot images of ngc  4631 ( figure  [ figure.gallery_starburst ] ) , the halo is both less prominent and more symmetric than in the _ galex _ images .",
    "this probably results from the `` background '' regions in the uvot being inside the uv halo itself , a scenario that is supported by the _ galex _ images .",
    "in other cases , differences between the morphology in each filter likely indicate physical differences .",
    "for example , in m82 and ngc  253 ( figure  [ figure.gallery_starburst ] ) , the nuv halo appears more like a thick disk than the fuv halo , which is more filamentary in nature .",
    "this morphology can not be explained by psf - wing contamination or filter artifacts .",
    "we investigated the contribution of stellar clusters or background sources to the diffuse light in those galaxies with _ hst _ observations in the @xmath23 band or bluer .",
    "for these objects , we identified point - like sources in the _ hst _ maps that were not already identified and removed in our maps and predicted a _ swift _ or _ galex _ flux for each , assuming that each source has the spectrum of a b star .",
    "we then compared the flux to the total diffuse uv flux , and found that it can explain at most a few percent of the light .",
    "the exception that proves the rule is ngc  4522 , where the virgo cluster is stripping the ism @xcite and there are known stellar clusters in the halo . in this case , most of the flux in the fuv comes from these clusters .",
    "even ngc  4522 has a diffuse component , however , so we conclude that all of these galaxies have true diffuse uv halos .",
    "there are three qualitative morphological metrics we use to compare the uv halos in our sample : filamentary structure , concentration of the uv light ( both in the vertical direction and along the disk ) , and symmetry across the midplane . in general ,",
    "these are consistent among filters for a given galaxy .",
    "[ [ filaments ] ] filaments + + + + + + + + +    filaments are most easily visible in the fuv , and they are seen in most starburst galaxies ( m82 , ngc  253 , ngc  3079 , ngc  3628 , ngc  4666 , and ngc  5775 ) , as well as two normal galaxies ( ngc  4522 , ngc  4330 ) .",

    "we examined the degree of concentration by dividing the uv halo at the midplane and projected galactic center into four quadrants , which were summed .",

    "is unrelated to the prominence of the bulge , so it is unlikely that the radially concentrated uv halos are merely light from the bulge outskirts .",
    "the radial or vertical concentration is also unrelated ( within each subsample ) to the total halo luminosity .",

    "a hint of a similar warp can be seen in the combined image of ngc  4388 .",
    "in addition to structures visible in each band , we looked for spectral structure in the uv halos . in regions",

    "we used the fluxes measured in long boxes because the @xmath5 is only high enough in a few galaxies to measure scale heights at different radii . to see how the aggregate behaves , we fit scale heights at several galactocentric radii in the stacked quadrant images .",

    "the galactic or halo properties that seem to be connected to other morphological indicators of uv halos do not predict the scale height .    in several galaxies",
    ", @xmath218 varies between filters .",
    "for example , in ngc  253 the joint fit to all filters results in @xmath229 but with a reduced @xmath230 .",
    "the fuv profile is marginally fit for @xmath231kpc ( reduced @xmath232 ) , but the nuv profile can not be fit with a single exponential profile ( @xmath233kpc with reduced @xmath234 ) . a double exponential profile is a good fit with an inner component ( @xmath235kpc ) and an outer component ( @xmath236kpc ) , so it is possible that the nuv light has a compact component and a component similar to the fuv halo . figure  [ figure.gallery_starburst ] shows that the nuv light follows the disk much better than the fuv light , suggesting a possible difference in physical origin .",
    "a similar difference is found in m82 , where the joint fit produces @xmath237kpc ( @xmath238 ) and the best - fit values of @xmath218 in each filter are : @xmath239 , 3.0 , 2.9 , 3.2 , and 2.5kpc for the fuv , _",

    "filters , respectively ( with corresponding @xmath240 , 4.4 , 0.8 , 2.9 , and 12 ) . as in ngc  253 ,",
    "the fuv halo is more extended , and the redder filters can not be adequately described by single exponential models . on the other hand , in ngc  55",
    "( joint @xmath241kpc and @xmath242 ) the fuv halo has a smaller scale height than the nuv ( @xmath243kpc compared to 1.3kpc ) .",
    "it is tempting to ascribe the difference in behavior to the presence of galactic winds , and indeed ngc  3079 , ngc  4631 , and ngc  4666 do have shallower fuv than nuv profiles , but the @xmath5 is generally too low in the normal galaxies to determine if this is a clear difference between them .",
    "we also searched for different scale heights across the midplane . in many cases ,",
    "one filter has a different profile across the midplane while the others do not , but these can usually be explained by a small background gradient across the region of the galaxy ( e.g. , due to galactic cirrus , which differs in strength between filters ) .",
    "the exception is m82 , where the fuv markedly differs across the midplane in a way that other filters do not .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the wind is brightest in the fuv , as seen in figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_sb ] .",
    "most galaxies have approximately symmetric flux profiles , despite differences in the visible morphology across the midplane ( e.g. , figure  [ figure.gallery_starburst ] ) .",
    "the galaxies where there is a notable difference in multiple filters include ngc  4666 , ngc  4522 , ngc  4330 , and ngc  134 .",
    "the latter three galaxies have an obvious asymmetry due to stripped gas ( figure  [ figure.gallery_normal ] ) .",
    "ngc  4666 is the least inclined galaxy in the sample , and the asymmetry in scale heights may pertain to inclination and projection effects , as mentioned in .",
    "we measured the correlation between the fuv@xmath27nuv color in each flux measurement bin and the projected height of the bin for each galaxy with data in both filters .",
    "most galaxies have no significant correlation ( for a threshold of @xmath244 ) , and the exceptions are all starbursts . in ngc  253 ,",
    "m82 , ngc  4631 , ngc  3628 , ngc  3079 , and ngc  4388 , the fuv@xmath27nuv color decreases with height .",
    "this is consistent with the fuv@xmath27nuv color maps ( figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_sb ] ) and suggests that the uv halos comprise two components .    to improve the signal",
    ", we measured the fuv@xmath27nuv color as a function of height in composites of the normal , starburst , and stripped galaxies ( of which ngc  4522 and ngc  4330 have _ galex _ data ) .",
    "the composite measurements are shown in figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_height ] .",
    "the data were binned in boxes 2kpc wide , with the first box having a central height of 3kpc from the midplane .",
    "the projected distances from the midplane for each measurement were used to assign each measurement to the appropriate bin , and the galaxies were projected to a common distance of 20mpc for the purpose of computing the magnitudes . figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_height ] reinforces the conclusions from the individual galaxies : the starburst halos become bluer with height , the normal galaxies have an approximately constant color , and the stripped galaxies are strikingly blue near the disk and similar to the normal galaxies at larger heights .",
    "however , some variation in the color with height is seen in a few individual normal galaxies .",
    "more data are necessary to determine if this is similar to what is seen in the starbursts .",

    ". however , the scale height has no ( strong ) dependence on the halo or intrinsic galaxy properties .      for most galaxies in the _ galex _ and _ swift _ archive it is not possible to examine the morphology in detail because of low @xmath5 or large distance .",

    "apart from the clear divide between normal and starburst galaxies , @xmath271 appears unrelated to the halo morphology , except in stripped galaxies .",
    "for example , ngc  5907 has a very patchy , low @xmath5 halo in figure  [ figure.gallery_normal ] , but its @xmath271 is among the highest of the normal galaxies . since we know that @xmath271 is uncorrelated with @xmath218 it does not provide information about the halo structure .",

    "in we measured fluxes without the psf - wing correction and used these fluxes to find scale heights for several galaxies and measure correlations between some of the same quantities as above .",
    "the psf - wing contamination is strongest near the disk , so we might expect @xmath218 to increase when the spurious flux is removed , but this is not generally the case .",

    "the lower fluxes also change the seds , but the only trend reported in that is truly artificial is the uniform rise in the fuv@xmath27nuv color with height ; we find in most galaxies no change with height .",
    "@xcite investigated the role of psf - wing contamination in several galaxies included in , and found that in two cases ( ngc  24 and ic  5249 ) the uv halo that we reported appears to be entirely artificial .",
    "they used the _",

    "ic  5249 is seen edge - on has a very thin optical disk , so it is possible that any astrophysical uv halo exists primarily below this .",
    "based on these results and the detections in our present sample , uv halos are ubiquitous but may not be universal ( or universally detectable with current instruments ) .",
    "prior studies have argued that the uv halos are ern on the basis that the light is too bright to come from shock - heated or photoionized gas @xcite , that line emission from starburst halos is polarized in a way that is consistent with dust scattering @xcite , that it can be successfully modeled by monte carlo radiative transfer scattering models @xcite , that it is too blue to originate in the stellar halo , and that they are coincident with edig , winds , and other outflow tracers .",

    "this rules out an emission nebula as the source .",
    "starburst galaxies have more luminous uv halos , but not higher @xmath300 values or scale heights . 6 .",
    "starburst winds are visible through their smaller fuv@xmath27nuv colors , which appear to be superimposed on a thick disk similar to ( although brighter than ) that around normal galaxies .",

    "the strong connection between @xmath271 and @xmath246 and the weak connection between @xmath300 and the presence of outflows strongly suggests that uv halos are ern .",
    "this also explains their broadband visibility and ubiquity , as non - ionizing uv photons can escape even if the disk is not porous .",
    "if uv halos are ern , then they indicate that dust is widespread in the halos of spiral galaxies of all types .",

    ", sightlines vertically above the starburst region would reflect a bluer incident spectrum than the rest of the disk .",
    "this behavior can be generalized to regions in the disk .",
    "we can not rule out either possibility , but in m82 the data suggest that the color change in height results from a change in the dust .",
    "let us assume that the halo dust does not change .",
    "then , for a partially obscured nuclear starburst viewed edge - on , in which light can escape along the minor axis , we expect the ern to form bright lobes above the starburst and near the disk",
    ". these will be visible against the rest of the ern .",
    "the lobes are bright near the disk because both the incident flux and column density are higher there .",
    "lobes of bluer color than the rest of the ern will also occur , with a small height offset between the bluest and brightest region .",
    "this offset occurs because the contribution to the ern from the rest of the disk ( with a redder incident spectrum ) is also greatest near the disk . above the blue lobes ,",
    "the halo becomes redder as the incident flux from the starburst declines and the reflected flux from this region competes with the flux from the remainder of the disk .",
    "we confirmed these features through mcrt models of partially obscured starbursts , as shown in figure  [ figure.mcrt_sb ] .",
    "we tried two models : a model with the same setup as described above except with 90% of the emissivity clustered in the inner 1kpc , and a variation of this model with a `` wind cone '' of denser material . to examine the color we assumed that the starburst region has a starburst  2 spectrum and the remainder of the disk has an sc spectrum from the kinney - calzetti atlas @xcite .",
    "we do not simulate a full spectrum , but rather determined the proper relative luminosities for the fuv and nuv bands .",
    "the cone has an opening angle of 50  degrees , a width of 0.8kpc , and a density that declines exponentially with height but is uniform at each height within the cone region .",
    "the vertical profile is @xmath383 , where @xmath13 is 1/10 of the peak , central density that is constrained by the hi data and the scale height @xmath384kpc .",
    "these parameters are motivated by the appearance of limb - brightened winds in h@xmath1 , but are not fits to the data .",
    "we tried one additional variation in which the interior of the cone has zero density ( i.e. , it lacks dust ) .    in the case without the wind cone the main feature is the appearance of the lobes described above , whereas the remainder of the ern looks like that for a normal disk galaxy .",
    "when the cone is present , it is brighter than the rest of the halo and its center is bluer than average , while the projected sides are relatively red .",
    "however , the presence of a cone does not change the presence of lobes in the fuv@xmath27nuv color map even if the interior of the cone is dust - free because the light is scattered by the dense cone walls .",
    "nuv color map for m82 .",
    "blue or purple colors indicate where the halo is bluer , while redder colors indicate larger fuv@xmath27nuv ( in magnitudes ) . _",
    "bottom left _ : an mcrt simulation of an obscured starburst with a wind cone and a redder disk .",
    "the brightest region of contours from the blue light are shown .",
    "a horizontal box indicates the galaxy disk .",
    "_ bottom right _ : a synthetic fuv@xmath27nuv color map showing the halo colors with the contours from left superimposed .",
    "we expect blue `` lobes '' , which are not seen in m82.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    m82 has bright lobes near the disk and there is indeed an offset between these lobes and the bluer region above , but there are no corresponding lobes in the fuv@xmath27nuv map and the color instead continues to become bluer with height and covers an increasingly large fraction of the projected area ( figure  [ figure.mcrt_sb ] ) .",
    "these features can not be explained by the simple geometric model above .",
    "the optical depth may be higher than we assume , which would suppress lobes in the color map , but the halo at larger heights would also be redder as the incident spectrum would change substantially through the halo .",
    "some of the fuv light may come from line emission , but the same morphology is seen in the very deep _",
    "uvw2 _ image .",
    "the simplest explanation of the color map is a change in the dust with height .",
    "this could either be a physical change in a single dust component with height or an increasing contribution from one component of dust .",
    "in other cases , such as ngc  253 or ngc  3079 , there are blue regions in the halo near the bases of the winds that may indicate a different light source rather than a difference in dust ( figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_sb ] ) . however , in both of these galaxies and in the composite starburst measurement , fuv@xmath27nuv color increases within a few kpc of the disk and then decreases with height ( figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_height ] ) .",
    "this suggests that these filamentary structures exist alongside an overall change in the dust with height .",
    "in contrast , most of the normal galaxies do not have significant fuv@xmath27nuv structure in figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_normal ] and the composite fuv@xmath27nuv color does not appear to change with increasing height .",
    "this suggests that the dust has similar properties between 2 - 12kpc .",
    "however , ngc  891 and ngc  5907 have high @xmath5 data and show a modest decline with height above 5kpc",
    ". deeper data for more galaxies are necessary to determine whether the color is constant with height .",
    "finally , in figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_height ] the stripped galaxies appear bluer than starburst galaxies at low heights and redder at larger heights .",
    "since some of the fuv emission comes from extraplanar star formation in these few cases , we speculate that the difference is not explained by a change in the dust with height .    if the fuv@xmath27nuv color change with height around starbursts results from a change in the dust , two plausible explanations are that galactic winds eject a different type of dust and carry it to larger heights than the processes in normal galaxies , or that winds and a comparatively intense radiation field alters the pre - existing dust at large heights . in normal galaxies",
    ", the dust may circulate through a galactic fountain @xcite , which is consistent with the measured uv scale heights of several kpc . on larger scales ,",
    "we expect the dust to change from milky way - like dust in the disk to smc - like dust by a radius of 20kpc @xcite , which ( for a given radiation field ) will lead to smaller fuv@xmath27nuv color ( however , cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* who find that most ",
    "extragalactic  dust can be explained by an extended disk ) . in the composite ( figure  [ figure.fuvnuv_height ] )",
    "we do not detect the transition through fuv@xmath27nuv color alone , but most of the galaxies do not have reliable fuv@xmath27nuv colors above 10kpc ; the values there for normal galaxies come from 2 - 4 galaxies , depending on the height .",
    "a clean test for this transition requires deeper data for more individual galaxies .",
    "if the dust does not change around normal galaxies up to heights difficult for a galactic fountain to reach , one possibility is that starburst episodes provide most of the halo dust .",
    "ngc  891 and m82 both have uv halos that have been previously studied , and here we compare our maps and results to those in the literature .",
    "ngc  891 is a normal milky way analog with an elevated star formation rate near 4@xmath385yr@xmath353 , @xcite and a bright x - ray halo @xcite , whereas m82 is the archetypal superwind galaxy .",
    "the uv halo around ngc  891 was modeled by @xcite , who found that the uv light is consistent with a scale height between 1.2 - 2kpc and a dust mass above a projected height of 2kpc of 3 - 5% of the total .",
    "@xcite find a dust mass in the disk of @xmath386 , so the halo dust mass from the mcrt models in @xcite is between @xmath387 .",
    "this is consistent with the mcrt scale height and mass we measured : @xmath388kpc and @xmath389 ( for milky way dust ) , whereas @xcite fit a profile along the projected minor axis , incorporating the core of the psf but not the highly extended wings .    in , where we did not account for the extended psf contamination of the halo",
    ", the uv intensity falls off more slowly with height on the side with the large filament , which also occurs in the x - rays and the 160@xmath28 m image .",
    "the combined , psf - corrected uv map shows that the part of the uv halo clearly associated with ngc  891 is brighter on that side ( figure  [ figure.gallery_normal ] ) , but the large - scale very diffuse emission is too extensive to be scattered light from dust around ngc  891 and may be galactic cirrus .",
    "the increased uv intensity near the galaxy may arise from dust within the filament material adding to the total dust column .",
    "@xcite examined extraplanar dust around ngc  891 in extinction at a lower height than the uv halo , finding filamentary structures that form a thick disk and have a mass of at least a few@xmath390 , or about 10 - 50% of the total @xcite .",
    "the resolution of their images is much higher than the uv images , so we can not rule out the possibility that the ern is also highly structured .",
    "however , the mass in the scattering component ( estimated through mcrt or 160@xmath28 m flux ) is less than half than that inferred by @xcite .",
    "this is also true if we measure the diffuse dust mass between 0.5 - 2kpc in our mcrt models .",
    "while they argue that it would be challenging for a galactic fountain @xcite or radiation pressure @xcite to lift enough dust mass to account for the extinction features they see , either mechanism could produce the smaller amount of diffuse dust inferred at large heights .",
    "this suggests that much of the dust in the chimneys falls back to the disk , and that the diffuse medium above 2kpc is a separate component .",
    "m82 has one of the first uv halos reported @xcite , since its extraplanar diffuse uv light is obvious from the image even without special processing .",
    "it is also the best - studied uv halo @xcite , and the dust content of the wind has also been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the consensus that the uv halo in m82 is an ern supports the identification of other uv halos as ern .",
    "the fir dust emission is seen to about the same or larger distances than in the uv , implying a mass of about @xmath391 @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to construct an accurate mcrt model for m82 than other disk galaxies because of its irregular morphology , but using the same method as described above we obtain a value of @xmath392 , which is consistent with the fir measurement .",
    "m82 also allows us to test our de - reddening procedure : our reported fuv @xmath393ergs@xmath353 , whereas @xcite estimate that the uv luminosity seen by the halo is @xmath394ergs@xmath353 .",
    "we suggest that the best simple explanation for the the fuv@xmath27nuv color change with height ( in m82 and starburst halos generally ) is a change in the dust .",
    "we note that @xcite show that there is little change in the 250@xmath28m/350@xmath28 m ratio in the region with the uv halo , but if the change is primarily one of composition rather than size the fir bands may not be sensitive to it .",
    "for example , @xcite successfully fit a two - component ( graphite and silicate ) dust model to extinction along different milky way and smc sight lines by changing the mixture but fixing the size distribution using the same law found by @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xcite found , using shallow _",
    "swift _ data , that the dust is consistent with a single size distribution .",
    "they focused on color - color plots where a change in composition is degenerate with a change in the incident spectrum , so neither of these studies presents strong evidence against a change in the dust type with height .",
    "however , we emphasize that we have not conclusively shown that the dust composition must change .",
    "we have described the morphology of uv halos around nearby , edge - on galaxies with and without superwinds , and here summarize our findings :    1 .",
    "uv halos are astrophysical and can be separated from galactic light scattered into the psf wings ( airy patterns ) .",
    "they are broadband phenomena and truly diffuse , with a flux of 1 - 20% of the apparent galaxy luminosity ( a few percent or less of the de - reddened values ) .",
    "they are visible to beyond 10kpc above the midplane .",
    "2 .   around normal galaxies ,",
    "uv halos tend to have a thick - disk morphology , but they differ in their radial concentration and vertical prominence . in superwind galaxies ,",
    "the uv halos are visible around the whole galaxy and contain filamentary structures seen at other wavelengths and associated with the winds .",
    "galaxies that are being stripped of their ism by ram pressure have asymmetric uv halos and some extraplanar star formation .",
    "3 .   among a variety of galactic parameters",
    ", we found that the uv halo luminosity is only correlated with the galaxy luminosity and the sfr .",
    "4 .   the structure , broadband visibility , and strong correlation of @xmath271 with @xmath246 for uv halos lead us to conclude that they are ern , which supports prior arguments made in the literature .",
    "the frequency of uv halos ( 100% in our uv - selected sample of highly inclined galaxies within 25mpc ) indicates that ern are ubiquitous , but not as extensive as reported in .",
    "the dust mass of the diffuse component above 2kpc , inferred from mcrt models that are constrained by the measured @xmath300 and 21-cm maps , is a few percent of the dust mass in the disk , and perhaps 10% of the dust mass seen in filamentary extraplanar structures at lower heights .",
    "deeper fir observations are needed to constrain @xmath367 in the halo dust for a direct measurement .",
    "there is tentative evidence for a change in the dust properties with height in starburst galaxies , but normal galaxies are consistent with constant dust properties between 2 - 12kpc .",
    "we expect virtually every star - forming galaxy to form an ern , but their detectability in a given sample is a strong function of the uv luminosity of the galaxy and the inclination . beyond about 25mpc",
    "it becomes difficult to isolate filamentary structure with _",
    "galex _ or _ swift _ , but within this limit the uv halos around normal galaxies appear smooth , and there are no clear features in the fuv@xmath27nuv color maps .",
    "one consequence is that the height profile used to constrain mcrt models @xcite provides a reasonable estimate of the dust mass , assuming a thick disk morphology .",
    "uv observations of more distant starburst or wind galaxies may not discern the wind structure , but an unusually extensive or blue uv halo may indicate the presence of a wind .",
    "our results confirm the presence of diffuse dust around galaxies as a general phenomenon .",
    "the dust is a reliable tracer of material that , at one point , originated in a galaxy disk , so the amount and physical properties ( grain size distribution , chemical composition , temperature , etc . ) tell us about the role of stellar ( or possibly agn ) feedback in the history of the galaxy and the pollution of the circumgalactic medium with metals .",
    "however , much work remains : a larger , less biased sample of uv halo properties is needed , at the cost of poorer resolution .",
    "this will be addressed in paper  ii . in paper",
    "iii , we will constrain dust properties in a simple model using the uv sed . beyond this , we need to understand the dust outflow mechanism ( the roles of radiation pressure and hydrodynamic entrainment ) , connect the uv sed to the fir sed , and determine if ( or how ) the dust within 10kpc of the galaxy connects to a larger circumgalactic component .",
