    "the baryonic processes that are essential for galaxy formation , such as gas cooling , star formation , and stellar and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback , constitute a complicated and highly non - linear network . modeling them appropriately in hydrodynamic simulations",
    "is hence the major challenge for the theoretical studies of galaxy formation ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some recent simulations successfully produce realistic galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key ingredient is undoubtedly stellar feedback such as supernova ( sn ) feedback that ejects gas from galaxies to prevent too efficient star formation . while it is possible to drive winds by resolving the detailed structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in very high resolution simulations @xcite , most of cosmological simulations invoke phenomenological treatments of feedback because of limited numerical resolution .",
    "some studies employ explicit winds , either hydrodynamically decoupled @xcite or coupled @xcite .",
    "the wind properties may depend on the galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "other popular way of implementing effective feedback is injecting thermal energy into the ism and then shutting off cooling of heated gas for a while @xcite .",
    "adding the feedback energy as non - thermal energy ( e.g. turbulence ) which decays in time - scale much longer than the cooling time has a similar effect @xcite .",
    "we have applied the feedback model developed by @xcite to large scale simulations to study high redshift galaxy populations , such as lyman-@xmath4 emitters @xcite , sub - mm galaxies @xcite , and lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "while these simulations reproduce many observed properties of high redshift galaxies , our studies utilizing the large scale simulations have been limited to high redshift because too massive galaxies form at low redshift ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that too many stars form in low mass halos at high redshift if we normalize the model to reproduce the luminosity ( or stellar mass ) function of the local faint galaxies @xcite .",
    "the first problem is well - known ; stellar feedback alone can not prevent monster galaxies from forming and hence we need a physical process that operates preferentially in large halos to quench gas cooling there ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "in fact , simulations including this feedback roughly reproduce galaxy stellar mass functions and stellar mass to halo mass relations for massive galaxies @xcite .    a remedy for the second problem has been recently identified by @xcite ; feedback prior to an sn , such as stellar winds and radiation from massive stars , is needed to match stellar mass - halo mass relations over a wide redshift range @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to update our galaxy formation model originally developed by @xcite and @xcite by adding several new feedback processes so that we can apply it for studies of galaxy population over wider mass and redshift ranges .",

    "full hydrodynamic interactions are enabled once a wind particle leaves the star - forming region ( @xmath46 ) or after the time , ( @xmath47 , has elapsed , whichever occurs earlier .",
    "we assume that some fraction of the energy released from sne is potentially available to power the kinetic energy of the wind .",

    "@xcite identified that the lag between a star formation event and an sn explosion ( @xmath57 ) is likely to be a source of the difficulty for simulations in reproducing the observationally suggested relation between stellar mass and halo mass .",
    "they reproduced the relation by distributing 10  % of the bolometric luminosity emitted by young stars to the surrounding star - forming gas as thermal energy over @xmath58  myr time period before an sn goes off .",
    "recently some numerical studies have indicated the importance of radiation pressure feedback from young stars on galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "momentum injection by stellar winds also can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "massive stars can radiatively drive stellar winds from their envelopes during the first stage of evolution , reaching terminal velocities of 10003000  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the momentum injection by the stellar winds is roughly the same order as that by the radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the momentum driven winds @xcite as the pre - sn feedback in this paper .",
    "the momentum injection rate from radiation can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively define the momentum transfer efficiencies for the direct absorption / scattering and for the multi - scattering by infrared photons re - radiated by dust particles ; @xmath62 is the infrared optical depth , @xmath63 is the luminosity of the stellar population , which we calculate using a population synthesis code pgase @xcite as a function of the age and the metallicity of the star particle , and @xmath64 is the speed of light .",
    "the first term of equation  ( [ eq : radiation ] ) should be proportional to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) optical depth .",

    "we set @xmath72 , which is consistent with the value found by @xcite who reported average infrared optical depth of @xmath73 in their high resolution simulated milky way - like galaxy .    during a time - step , @xmath35",
    ", a young star particle distributes the momentum and energy from radiation to surrounding gas particles .",
    "a gas particle thus may receive momentum , @xmath74 , and energy , @xmath75 , during any given time - step .",
    "the gas particle is selected to become a wind particle during that time - step with a probability , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the initial wind speed of the momentum - driven wind . as for the sn - driven wind , we assume that the wind speed is proportional to the local velocity dispersion as @xmath78 since the role of the pre - sn feedback is to delay the star formation until the sn feedback takes place @xcite , we assume @xmath79 so that the expelled gas by the pre - sn feedback can fall back later .",
    "@xcite found that the winds with the initial wind speed of @xmath80 are inefficient and have little effect on the luminosity function at @xmath81 .",
    "we hence employ @xmath82 .",

    "we generate a uniform random number between zero and one .",
    "when @xmath86 exceeds this number , the gas particle is added to a wind .",
    "we determine whether the wind is sn- or radiation pressure - driven by drawing a uniform random number between zero and one again .",
    "if @xmath87 is greater than this number , the gas particle is launched as an sn - driven wind with @xmath53 , otherwise it becomes a radiation pressure - driven wind with @xmath77 .",

    "it is now widely accepted that the stellar feedback alone can not explain bright- ( massive- ) end of the galaxy luminosity ( mass ) function and a feedback process that operates preferentially in large halos is needed .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations of galaxy clusters have revealed large , radio - plasma cavities in intracluster media ( icm ) .",
    "these are usually associated with episodic outbursts from a central radio galaxy , and indicate that huge amounts of mechanical energy are being deposited into the icm by powerful agn - driven jets @xcite .",
    "simulations investigating the impact of these agn - driven radio cavities suggest that this powerful feedback provides sufficient energy to offset the cooling radiation from the cluster and potentially explains why so little cool gas is seen in these systems @xcite .",
    "simple prescriptions for the feedback from agn jets ( aka . ` radio - mode feedback ' ) have been incorporated into semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . including radio - mode agn feedback has resulted in dramatic improvements in the models ability to match the sharp decline of the galaxy luminosity function and to explain the ` downsizing ' seen in the evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "@xcite showed that , by assuming that agn radio - mode feedback operates only in quasi - hydrostatic halos where the cooling time is longer than the dynamical time , the galaxy luminosity functions in local and higher redshift universe can be matched well .    in order to model the agn radio - mode feedback , @xcite and @xcite distinguished two fundamentally different modes of agn accretion : radiatively efficient ,",
    "geometrically thin accretion flows ( standard disks : @xcite ) and geometrically thick , radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( which we will generically refer to as riafs ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they assumed only the latter is responsible for the radio - mode feedback through production of powerful jets ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since riafs exist only when the accretion rate is much lower than the eddington rate @xcite , the radio - mode feedback is naturally switched on in cooling inefficient large halos where central blackholes become very massive and gas supply to them is slowed down @xcite .",
    "we however take a simpler , phenomenological approach in this paper because modeling agn feedback inevitably introduces many uncertainties , such as seed blackhole mass , accretion rates onto blackholes , blackhole mergers , and feedback from agn . in our phenomenological treatment , we simply assume that the radiative cooling is suppressed in large halos where one - dimensional dark matter velocity dispersion is larger than @xmath88 .",
    "we parameterize the functional form of @xmath88 as @xmath89 where the parameter , @xmath4 , controls the redshift dependence . in order to reduce cooling in large halos , we modify the cooling function , @xmath90 as @xmath91 where the parameter , @xmath92 , specifies how steeply the cooling is suppressed above the threshold velocity dispersion , @xmath93 .",
    "we find that a sudden suppression , i.e. @xmath94 for @xmath95 creates an unwanted bump around the mass corresponding to @xmath93 in the galaxy stellar mass function . to mimic the agn radio - mode feedback",
    ", @xmath4 must be greater than 0 since the velocity dispersion of a cooling inefficient halo increases with increasing redshift and , for given velocity dispersion of a halo , the central blackhole mass is likely to become smaller with increasing redshift ) , it is still possible to obtain a galaxy stellar mass function compatible with observational estimates at @xmath81 .",
    "we however lack massive galaxies at higher redshift in this case ( see @xcite ) . ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath96 and @xmath97 in our fiducial model @xcite .",
    "as we will show later , this choice makes the quenching almost negligible at high redshift ( @xmath98 ) because @xmath93 becomes large and halos that have higher velocity dispersion than @xmath93 are quite rare .",
    "we note that the comparable results to this set of parameters can be obtained with @xmath99  km  s@xmath13 if we assume a sudden suppression of the gas cooling above @xmath93 .

    "we show several combinations of the above feedback processes in order to highlight roles of each process .",
    "we refer to the sn feedback , the radiation pressure feedback , and the quenching of the cooling in large halos as ` sn ' , ` rp ' , and ` agn ' , respectively , for short . in this paper",

    "the model that employs all the feedback processes , ` sn+rp+agn ' , is our fiducial model .",
    "the model that only considers the sn feedback , ` sn ' , corresponds to the model we used in our previous studies @xcite , although the values of the parameters in these studies are slightly different from those in this paper mainly due to the differences in the numerical resolution and cosmology .",
    "in this section , we compare our simulations with the available observational estimates from @xmath0 to @xmath100 and show effects of each feedback process . to identify virialized dark matter halos , we first run the friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finder @xcite with a linking length 0.2 in units of the mean dark matter particle separation .",
    "gas and star particles near dark matter particles which compose a fof group are also regarded as the member of the group .",
    "we then identify gravitationally bound groups of dark matter , gas , and stars in each fof group by using the subfind algorithm @xcite .",

    "we now investigate the metallicity of galaxies which is a sensitive diagnostic of the feedback physics .",
    "in particular , the mass - metallicity relation is very sensitive to the winds properties @xcite .",
    "observationally , the nebula metallicity of galaxies is determined by measuring a ratio ( or ratios ) of emission lines that are usually emitted from and photo - dissociation regions .",
    "these lines come from the star forming regions . in order to compare our results with such observations ,",
    "we employ the nebula metallicity introduced by @xcite , which is defined as the lyman continuum weighted metallicity . in this definition ,",
    "only the metals around the very young star particles are taken into account .        in figure",
    "[ fig : mzr ] , we show the mass - metallicity relations at @xmath21 , 2 , 1.5 , 0.75 , and 0 and compare them with the several observational estimates",
    ". there are uncertainties in defining the metallicity from a ratio ( or ratios ) of emission lines @xcite .",
    "we have thus converted all the data into the ( , hereafter pp04 ) diagnostic . for the conversion between the pp04 and @xcite diagnostics",
    ", we apply an empirical conversion of @xcite .",
    "we use the relation by @xcite to convert the metallicity of @xcite into that by the pp04 diagnostic . note that because of the uncertainties in the observed metallicity and theoretical nucleosynthesis yields @xcite , the normalization of the mass - metallicity relation is less important than its slope and relative redshift evolution of the relationship .",
    "we find that all the models show similar slopes at high redshift ( @xmath101 ) . at low redshift",
    ", however , the models without the radiation pressure feedback have slightly steeper profiles than those with the radiation pressure feedback .",
    "these models also show stronger redshift evolution than the models with the radiation pressure .",
    "this is because the radiation pressure feedback becomes stronger in higher metallicity star - forming regions ( equation  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) ) and therefore it slows down the metal enrichment efficiently .",
    "consequently , the models without the radiation pressure feedback show slightly too strong redshift evolution compared with the observations . our fiducial model , ` sn+rp+agn ' , produces the mass - metallicity relation that is broadly consistent with the observational estimates , including the slope and the redshift evolution of the normalization because of the strong outward winds ( see the left panels ) .",
    "we note that we would obtain slightly higher metallicity if we had included metal diffusion because the diffusion leads to outflowing particles losing metals to the circum - galactic medium @xcite .",
    "the strange bump seen in the mass - metallicity relations at @xmath119 is due to the quantized star formation and insufficient resolution .",
    "the resolution study we will present in the next section shows that the bump moves to lower mass when we increase the resolution .",
    "it is important to know how simulation results depend on an adopted numerical resolution and what parameters we should adjust when we change the resolution . for this purpose",
    ", we perform two additional simulations with the same parameter set as ` sn+rp+agn ' , to which we refer as ` l40n256e40 ' in this section , but with higher and lower numerical resolutions .",
    "the simulations that employ 8 times higher and 8 times lower mass resolutions are called ` l40n512e40 ' and ` l40n128e40 ' , respectively . a gravitational softening length is a factor of 2 shorter ( longer ) in l40n512e40 ( l40n128e40 ) than that in l40n256e40 .",
    "we also change the star formation threshold density , @xmath120 , as a function of the numerical resolution ; we adopt a density that is higher by a factor of 4 for a mass resolution that is higher by a factor of 8 as done in @xcite to improve the numerical convergence ( see also @xcite ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : moster - conv ] , we compare the central galaxy formation efficiencies obtained from the three different resolution simulations .",
    "we find that our results are converging , i.e. the result from the intermediate resolution simulation is much closer to that from the high resolution one than that from the low resolution one .",
    "we also find that the simulations have not converged at the current resolution yet , i.e. the results from the high and intermediate resolution simulations do not agree with each other . in general , star formation in smaller halos is resolved with higher resolution and hence more stars form in a higher resolution simulation until a simulation resolves the smallest halo that can form stars after reionization ( @xmath121 ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "when a halo is more poorly resolved , winds may more easily escape from the halo to the intergalactic space .",
    "these two factors explain the resolution dependence seen in figure  [ fig : moster - conv ] .",
    "since the offset is observed mainly for the low mass halos , we may obtain a comparable result to the fiducial simulation ( l40n256e40 ) by enhancing the stellar feedback in the high resolution simulation . to test this , we also show the result from the simulation whose resolution is the same as l40n256e40 but with different values of the feedback parameters . in this simulation",
    "we increase the sn feedback efficiency from @xmath122 to 0.8 and the value of @xmath69 in the radiation pressure feedback from 30 to 40 .",
    "other parameters are remain fixed to the fiducial values . in order to save the computational time",
    ", we use a smaller simulation box size , 20  @xmath15  mpc , for this simulation .",
    "we call this additional simulation ` l20n256e80 ' .",
    "the result from this simulation is also shown in figure  [ fig : moster - conv ] , which is comparable to the fiducial simulation and consistent with the estimate by the abundance matching technique .",
    "we have confirmed that the same conclusion can be drawn from the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "next we show resolution effects on the stellar age . in figure",
    "[ fig : age - conv ] , we compare the stellar ages as functions of the stellar mass in the three different resolution simulations .",
    "the low resolution simulation exhibits rather old stellar age for all the mass range .",
    "the results from the high and intermediate resolution simulations agree with each other well , indicating the results almost converge for the stellar age at the intermediate resolution . by comparing the three simulations",
    ", we conclude the upturn in the stellar age toward lower stellar mass is purely a numerical effect since it occurs at much lower mass in the high resolution simulation .",
    "we also show the high resolution simulation with stronger feedback ( l20n256e80 ) .",
    "interestingly , the result is almost identical to that from the high resolution simulation ( l40n512e40 ) in spite of the difference in the galaxy formation efficiency ( see figure  [ fig : moster - conv ] ) .",
    "we note that the stellar age is nearly constant below @xmath123 in both of the two high resolution simulations , where the observationally estimated stellar age gradually decreases toward lower mass .",
    "this discrepancy seems to indicate that our galaxy formation model is still too simple and that processes which make the star formation time - scale longer in smaller galaxy are required , although the simulation results are still broadly consistent with the observational estimate at @xmath124 .",
    "finally we investigate resolution effects on the mass - metallicity relation . in figure",
    "[ fig : mzr - conv ] , we show the nebula metallicities as functions of the stellar mass in the three different resolution simulations .",
    "we find that the slopes well converge and that all the simulations show similar redshift evolution .",
    "we also find that the bump seen at low - mass end is purely a resolution effect .",
    "the bump moves to lower mass when we increase the resolution .",
    "a higher resolution simulation exhibits higher metallicity indicating that the feedback effect is weaker in a higher resolution simulation .",
    "the high resolution simulation with stronger feedback ( l20n256e80 ) recovers the result from the fiducial simulation ( l40n256e40 ) .",
    "the result from l20n256e80 is highlighted in the right panels , which shows that it is , in fact , very similar to that from l40n256e40 shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : mzr ] .",
    "we have updated the galaxy formation model described by @xcite to study evolution of galaxy population .",
    "the new model employs suppression of gas cooling in large halos and momentum injection by radiation pressure from massive stars in addition to sn feedback .",
    "we normalize the model parameters so that the fiducial simulation matches the observationally estimated stellar mass functions and galaxy formation efficiencies from @xmath0 to 0 .",
    "interestingly , the fiducial model also well reproduces other observational properties of galaxy population : the cosmic star formation rate density , the main sequence of star - forming galaxies , the stellar age - stellar mass relation , and the mass - metallicity relation over a wide range of redshift .    in order to investigate the roles of individual feedback processes",
    ", we have performed the simulations by switching on and off each of them alternately .",
    "the suppression of the gas cooling in large halo , which we view as a phenomenological treatment of the radio mode agn feedback , is necessarily to explain the high mass - end of the galaxy stellar mass functions and the decline of the cosmic star formation rate density at low redshift .",
    "our simple quenching model well describes the star formation properties in massive galaxies .",
    "this process makes the stellar age of massive galaxies older and nicely reproduces the galaxy downsizing for massive galaxies with @xmath116 . on the other hand ,",
    "our high resolution simulations show that the stellar age of the less massive galaxies is nearly constant for @xmath125 , while the observations suggest that the less massive galaxies have younger stellar age .",
    "this discrepancy for the low mass galaxies might suggest that our galaxy formation model is still too simple and we need processes that make effective star formation time - scale longer in smaller galaxies .",
    "when we do not consider the radiation pressure feedback , the redshift evolution of the mass - metallicity relation is slightly too strong and the slope of the relation is too steep at low redshift .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the radiation pressure feedback helps to make the simulation result broadly consistent with the observational estimates .",
    "this fact provides a strong case for the radiation pressure feedback .",
    "we find that the introduction of the agn - like feedback and the radiation pressure feedback little affects the results at high redshift ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we thus expect that our conclusions derived from the simulations of high redshift galaxy population @xcite , which only take the sn feedback into account , still hold .",
    "however the lack of the galaxies with sfr @xmath126  yr@xmath13 at @xmath98 , which exist in ` sn ' model , might become a problem to account for the sub - mm source number counts .",
    "we leave this issue for future work .",
    "the resolution study shows that the simulation results are converging numerically although the perfect numerical convergence has not been achieved at the current resolution .",
    "we show that , from a high resolution simulation , consistent results with the intermediate resolution simulation can be obtained by applying slightly stronger stellar feedback while the agn - like feedback is remain unchanged .",
    "we expect that we would need little change in the parameter values if we employed even higher resolution because the simulation results in @xcite and @xcite nicely converged with @xmath127 for milky way - sized galaxies and with @xmath128 even for the local group satellite galaxies .",
    "the new model can apply for wider ranges of redshift and mass than the previous model that forms too massive galaxies in large halos , in particular , at low redshift .",
    "this simple model is well suited for simulations that relate high redshift galaxy population to the local one and for studies of coevolution of cluster galaxies and an icm .    we would like to thank ryu makiya and masahiro nagashima for helpful discussion .",
