    "it was already noted in @xcite that lattice anisotropy is a marginal perturbation in the rg sense , thus it was not obvious a priori to what extent two - scale factor universality is valid in the presence of anisotropic couplings @xcite .",
    "it was also known that , for most anisotropic systems , ( asymptotic ) isotropy can be restored by an anisotropic scale transformation @xcite ( for further references see @xcite ) .",
    "recently it was pointed out @xcite that , in systems with anisotropic interactions of non - cubic symmetry , the scaling function @xmath51 is indeed affected by anisotropy . in particular , it was shown @xcite that by means of an appropriate rescaling of lengths a transformation to an ( asymptotically ) isotropic system is always possible provided that the anisotropy matrix @xmath52 is positive definite and that the rescaling is performed along the @xmath2 _ nonuniversal _ directions of the _ principal _ axes which , in general , differ from the symmetry axes of the system .",
    "this rescaling is equivalent to a shear transformation which distorts the shape , the lattice structure , and the boundary conditions in a nonuniversal way ( e.g. from a cube to a parallelepiped , from an orthorhombic to a triclinic lattice , and from periodic b.c . in rectangular directions to those in non - rectangular directions ) .",
    "this nonuniversality is reflected in a dependence of the scaling function @xmath51 on the anisotropy matrix @xmath52 , in addition to the dependence on @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the remaining @xmath75 nonuniversal parameters , however , are hidden in the index `` iso , @xmath76 '' .",
    "this index is the notation for a system with the shape of a parallelepiped whose interaction @xmath77 is ( asymptotically ) isotropic and whose @xmath78 angles and @xmath79 length ratios are determined by the @xmath80 nonuniversal parameters of the reduced anisotropy matrix @xmath76 .",
