    "factorization is part of the foundations of high - energy hadronic physics , as it provides the key ingredient for the phenomenological studies of high - energy experiments .",
    "factorization theorems make the separation between short - distance perturbative physics and long - distance nonperturbative effects possible .",
    "thus , cross sections measured in high - energy experiments can be factorized into products of hard parts ( short - distance physics ) and parton distributions ( nonperturbative physics ) .",
    "in addition , an essential part of factorization is the universality of the parton distributions , among different processes .    while collinear factorization has been the most widely used framework in phenomenological studies , and",
    "remains a sufficiently good approximation of qcd for the most inclusive processes in hadronic collisions , the investigation of less inclusive observables showed the need for a transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization . during the last decade",
    ", a large amount of work has been devoted to establish such a framework in qcd .",
    "however , recent progress @xcite has shown that tmd factorization is violated for dijet production in hadron - hadron ( e.g. , pp ) collisions , due to a loss of universality .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a solution to this problem in the small-@xmath0 limit : we succeeded in establishing an effective tmd factorization for hard processes in collisions of dilute probes off dense hadrons ( or large nuclei ) .",
    "we confirm that tmd parton distributions are not universal , but we show that at small-@xmath0 they can be constructed from several universal individual building blocks .",
    "this is achieved by working with an appropriate approximation of qcd in the small-@xmath0 limit of qcd , where large parton densities and non - linear _ saturation _ effects are crucial .",
    "the saturation phenomena in high - energy collisions has attracted great attention in the last two decades . at very high energies corresponding to the low-@xmath0 regime ,",
    "parton distributions reach very high densities and non - linear effects become important in describing the dynamics of the hadronic system @xcite . the transition to the saturation regime",
    "is characterized by the saturation scale , which is interpreted as the typical transverse momentum of the small-@xmath0 partons , and is also related to the transverse color charge density in the infinite momentum frame of the dense target .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the high density of gluons inside a hadron or nucleus allows for a semiclassical treatment of the color field , leading to the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective description of the small-@xmath0 part of the hadronic / nuclear wave function which has been widely used to systematically study saturation physics @xcite .",
    "experimental data is still not conclusive in this matter , but strong evidence of these effects have been found in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments at hera and deuteron - gold collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "it is expected that saturation physics will play an important role in explaining the results of the ongoing measurements of single - inclusive production and two - particle correlations in the forward region at rhic as well as future heavy - ion experiments at lhc .",
    "in addition , the planned electron - ion collider @xcite will be able to provide ideal experimental conditions to study the low-@xmath0 parton distributions and thus test the saturation physics in both protons and large nuclei .    in saturation physics , two different unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugds )",
    "have been widely used in the literature .",
    "the first gluon distribution , which is known as the weizscker - williams ( ww ) gluon distribution , is calculated from the correlator of two classical gluon fields of relativistic hadrons ( non - abelian weizscker - williams fields )  @xcite . the ww gluon distribution has a clear physical interpretation as the number density of gluons inside the hadron in light - cone gauge , but is not used to compute cross sections .",
    "on the other hand , the second gluon distribution , which is defined as the fourier transform of the color dipole cross section , does not have a clear partonic interpretation , but it is the one appearing in most of the @xmath1-factorized formulae found in the literature for single - inclusive particle production in @xmath2 collisions  @xcite .",
    "it was a long - standing question what is fundamentally different between these two gluon distributions , and whether there is any observable sensitive to the ww distribution @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to answer these questions and show that these two gluon distributions are the fundamental building blocks of all the tmd gluon distributions at small @xmath0 .",
    "eventually , this leads us to an effective tmd - factorization for dijet production , in the collision of a dilute probe with a dense target .",
    "we find that , in the small momentum imbalance limit described below , the dijet production process in dis can provide direct measurements of the ww gluon distribution and the photon - jet correlations measurement in @xmath2 collisions can access the dipole gluon distribution directly .",
    "in addition , other more complicated dijet production processes in @xmath2 collisions will involve both of these gluon distributions through convolution in transverse momentum space , when the large-@xmath3 limit is taken .",
    "a short summary of our study has been published in ref .",
    "here we present the detailed derivations , and the precise equivalence between the tmd and cgc approaches , in the overlapping domain of validity , i.e. to leading power of the hard scale and in the small @xmath0 limit .",
    "in general , the tmd factorization is valid whatever @xmath0 is but is a leading - twist approach , while the cgc is applicable only at small @xmath0 but contains all the power corrections .",
    "since the main objective of this paper is to understand dijet production processes theoretically , we will put the phenomenological studies in a future work .",
    "we focus on the two particle production ( or dijet production at higher energy ) in the case of a dilute system scattering on a dense target , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dijetf ] , @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the dense target ( we shall call it a nucleus in the following ) , @xmath6 stands for the dilute projectile ( such as a photon or a high-@xmath0 parton in a hadron ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the final state two particles with momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "let us denote as @xmath11 the light - cone momentum fraction of the parton ( or virtual photon ) from the incoming projectile @xmath6 , and as @xmath12 the momentum fraction of the gluon from the incoming target .",
    "we are interested in the kinematic region where the transverse momentum imbalance between the outgoing particles is much smaller than their individual momenta : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "this is referred to as the back - to - back correlation limit ( the correlation limit ) in the following discussions .",
    "an important advantage of taking this limit is that we can apply the power counting method to obtain the leading order contribution of @xmath16 where the differential cross section directly depends on the ugds of the nuclei .    for each individual dijet production process , we employ two independent approaches , namely the tmd approach and the cgc approach - point functions differently by using wilson lines . ] .",
    "the tmd approach is straightforward and clear in terms of factorization . on the other hand ,",
    "the cgc approach is commonly used in dealing with small-@xmath0 calculations .",
    "it allows to go beyond the correlation limit , which gives a deeper access to the qcd dynamics at small @xmath0 , but this is not the purpose of this paper . in this more general situation ,",
    "cross sections involve multi - gluon distribution functions , as expected due to parton saturation and multiple scatterings , and therefore there is no @xmath1-factorization .",
    "except for the most inclusive observables ( such as inclusive and semi - inclusive dis , single - gluon and valence quark production in pa collisions ) , @xmath1 factorization is only a property of the linear bfkl regime .",
    "however taking the correlation limit allows to simplify the dijet production results of the cgc , and to obtain an effective factorization which coincides with that found in the tmd approach .",
    "the weizscker - williams gluon distribution can be defined following the conventional gluon distribution   @xmath17where @xmath18 is the gauge field strength tensor @xmath19 with @xmath20 the antisymmetric structure constants for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the gauge link in the adjoint representation @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "it contains a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity which is important to make the definition gauge invariant  @xcite .",

    "the two terms appearing above have a simple interpretation in terms of multiple scatterings that allows us to label the first term as the elastic part and the second term as the inelastic part ( see @xcite where the same scattering factor appears in the context of two - gluon production ) .",
    "taking into account that the gaussian distribution of sources is equivalent to the two gluon exchange approximation with independent scattering centers , it is easy to see that the first term is what you would expect if only interactions that do nt break up nucleons in the nucleus were allowed . in that scenario",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is always on a singlet state and the interaction factor can be written as the product of the interaction term for a dipole in the amplitude times an interaction term for the dipole in the conjugate amplitude .",
    "the inelastic part takes into account all the interactions were at least one of the nucleons is broken apart , in which case the quark - antiquark pair goes from a singlet state to an octet state . in the large-@xmath3 limit transitions from the octet state to the singlet state are suppressed and therefore the pair remains in the octet state for the rest of the interaction with the nucleus .",
