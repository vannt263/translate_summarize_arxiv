    "the quantum optical behaviour of atomic systems coupled to a continuum of the quantized electromagnetic field modes has been studied since the early days of quantum physics .",
    "the quantum electromagnetic field is a large system , which can be treated as a bath or reservoir . in most cases",
    "the atom - field coupling constants and the electromagnetic field mode density are slowly varying functions of frequency , and the dynamics of the atomic system can be treated via markovian master equations @xcite , or equivalent methods such as quantum langevin equations ( see e.g.  barnett97 for details of these standard methods ) .",
    "these techniques are based on quantum electromagnetic field states with no special distinction for any particular mode in terms of photon occupation number , such as thermal states or broad - band squeezed states . naturally ,",
    "if one mode of the electromagnetic field was in a special state , such as a large amplitude coherent state ( as in the case where the atom is also coupled to a laser field ) , then this special mode and the atomic system would be treated as a small quantum system with the remaining modes constituting the reservoir , so that markovian behaviour would still apply for the small system .    in certain cases however , such as for atoms in high q cavities or in photonic band gap materials , either the coupling constants or the mode density ( or both ) are no longer slowly varying functions and standard markovian master equation methods are no longer valid ( see lambropoulos00 for a recent review ) .",
    "a number of non - markovian methods have been formulated , see , for example , references in ref .",
    "these include non - markovian master equations zwanzig64,nakajima58,barnett00 , the time - convolutionless projection operator master equation @xcite , heisenberg equations of motion @xcite , stochastic wave - function methods for non - markovian processes @xcite , methods based on the essential states approximation or resolvent operators @xcite , the pseudo - mode approach @xcite , fano diagonalization @xcite ( and jeffers00,dalton01a ) , and various short - time approximations braun01,privman02 .",
    "the last four approaches are easiest to apply , providing clear physical insight into the processes involved .",
    "one such method is that of pseudo - mode theory @xcite .",
    "this method was developed for the case of a two level atom coupled to a structured electromagnetic field reservoir in the vacuum states and was then restricted to single photon excitations of the reservoir .",
    "the treatment started from the time dependent state vector for the atom - field system , written as a linear combination of one photon states with the atom in the ground state and vacuum states with the atom in the excited state .",
    "the basis of the method was that the atomic dynamics only depended in this case on the behaviour of a single function , the reservoir structure function , defined as the product of the mode density and the square of the coupling constant .",
    "the complex frequencies and residues of the poles of this function in the lower half complex frequency plane enabled so called pseudo - modes to be introduced , one for each of the finite number of poles . the non - markovian equation for the complex amplitude of the state with the atom excited ( and the field in the vacuum state ) could then be replaced by markovian equations involving the _ finite _ number of pseudo - mode amplitudes together with the amplitude for the excited atomic state .",
    "the pseudo - modes are originally related mathematically to the reservoir structure function , but in some cases their physical origin can be explained . for the case of the atom in a high q cavity , where the coupling constants vary rapidly near the cavity resonance frequencies whilst the mode density is slowly varying , the pseudo - modes can be interpreted @xcite in terms of the cavity quasimodes @xcite . for the case of an atom in a photonic band gap system , no pseudo - mode theory is yet available , though a treatment in terms of quasimodes @xcite can be used to account for the frequency dependence of the coupling constants and mode densities .",
    "a treatment of superradiance in a photonic band gap continuum @xcite is based on the idea of replacing the photonic band gap system by a pair of degenerate cavity modes coupled to the multi - atom system and with each other , one of the modes being also coupled to a markovian bath . in terms of the treatment in @xcite",
    ", such a case would produce a fano - profile reservoir structure function , with the fano window representing the photonic band gap .",
    "the two cavity modes would correspond to two pseudo - modes .",
    "the problem for photonic band gap situations is that the mode density is actually a discontinuous function of the frequency , and thus the reservoir structure function would not have a finite number of simple poles , though approximate representations of the reservoir structure function in such a form might be found .",
    "leaving aside the difficulties associated with the pseudo - mode theory for photonic band gap systems , it would be desirable to see if pseudo - mode theory could be extended to cases where multiple photon excitation of the structured reservoir is involved , as the original treatment @xcite only covers single photon excitation .",
    "the limitation of current treatments to the single photon excitation case has been noted in ref .",
    "lambropoulos00 , but some work has been carried out on cases of multiphoton excitation of the reservoir . such a multiphoton situation would apply if the two level atom was replaced by a three level cascade ( or ladder ) system , with an initial condition of the atom in the uppermost state and no photons present in the electromagnetic field .",
    "the two - step decay will generate electromagnetic field states with two photons present .",
    "another case of multiphoton excitation occurs for an excited two level atom coupled to a defect mode containing one photon , the atom also being coupled to a photonic band gap continuum . beginning with the essential states approximation , a numerical method based on replacing the density of modes by a discretised model has been used in this latter situation nikolopoulos99,nikolopoulos01 and in the case of the cascade system nikolopoulos00 .",
    "similar numerical methods have also been used to treat stimulated emission in a photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "the cascade system case with one transition coupled near - resonantly to the edge of a photonic gap ( and the other coupled to a flat continuum ) has also been treated via the resolvent operator method in ref .",
    "although the treatment is analytic , this feature results from being able to ignore processes in which the two emitted photons are produced in a different sequence  a reasonable approximation if the two transition frequencies are very different .",
    "however , a more general analytical method would be desirable , and therefore we aim to see if pseudo - mode theory can be extended to treat the multiphoton excitation case without having to make assumptions about the order in which the photons are produced . whether an extension is possible",
    "involves first showing that the atomic dynamics only depends on the behavior of reservoir structure functions  in a cascade system we would expect there to be more than one reservoir structure function , since two coupling constants are present .",
    "a next step would be to then introduce suitable pseudo - mode amplitudes , based on the poles of the reservoir structure functions and to show that markovian equations apply to these pseudo - mode amplitudes .",
    "the present paper shows ( following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , that in the case of a three - level atomic system the dynamics is completely controlled by the reservoir structure functions , and gives several methods for determining the atomic and field behaviour .",
    "these methods could be applied both to photonic band - gap and high q cavity cases , since the general equations ( [ c32.2]-[c38.3 ] ) defining the solution only depend on the reservoir structure functions and not on the specific type of structured reservoir involved . however , as a test , in this paper we only apply the methods to a situation involving a single lorentzian reservoir structure function .",
    "this situation could apply when both cascade transitions have the same frequency and are equally coupled to a single high q cavity mode .",
    "we also are able to interpret the results via an equivalent pseudo - mode model .",
    "situations involving photonic band gaps could be modelled by appropriate reservoir structure functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "section [ sec : model ] of this paper sets out the theory of non - markovian dynamical behaviour for the three level cascade system where both transitions are coupled to a single structured reservoir .",
    "the state amplitudes are determined from solutions to certain integral equations .",
    "approaches to solving the dynamical equations , including a numerical determination of the excited state probability for a simple case ( and its pseudo - mode theory interpretation ) is presented in section [ sec : solution ] .",
    "section [ sec : separate res ] deals with the simpler case of non - markovian dynamics for the cascade system with the two transitions coupled to two separate reservoirs , again with numerical results presented for comparison to the single reservoir case .",
    "an alternative approach to solving the dynamical equations based on non - orthogonal eigenfunction methods is set out in appendices [ sec : appa][sec : appd ] .",
    "the paper is summarised in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the model system we will consider has a three level atom , with states denoted @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , coupled to a reservoir of electromagnetic radiation modes ( or heatbath ) which is to be at effectively zero temperature .",

    "real coupling constants will be chosen .",
    "it is these frequency dependent coupling constants combined with the mode density which define the reservoir structure .",

    "these equations  for a cascade system coupled to a single structured reservoir , are equivalent to those in ref .",
    "it should be noted that similar equations are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case where the two transitions are coupled to two separate reservoirs .",
    "this case is treated below in section [ sec : separate res ] .",
    "the two separate reservoirs case leads to simpler equations ",
    "firstly , because it is assumed that the @xmath31 photons are produced in just one sequence ( for example @xmath32 are not present .",

    "@xcite , resulting in their equations for @xmath42 being easily solvable .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the additional terms we have result from allowing for photons to be emitted into the single reservoir in two different sequences , an effect not present in the two separate reservoir case treated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our case",
    ", we next convert the sums to integrals , i.e.  @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mode density , so that eq .",
    "( [ c31.2 ] ) can be written in the form of an integral equation @xmath48with @xmath49the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 are of course all functions of the laplace variable @xmath30 , but for simplicity of notation @xmath30 is left implicit . the integral equation ( [ c32.2 ] ) is a fredholm integral equation of the second kind ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "methods of solution for such equations include replacing the frequency spaces by grids of points , thereby converting the integral equation into matrix equations that could be solved numerically for each value of @xmath30 .",
    "we will discuss one such approach in section [ sec : examp ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appd ] we also discuss a more formal method of solving the integral equation , based on the eigenfunctions of the kernel @xmath52 and of its adjoint .",
    "we also find it convenient to write the integral equation in the form @xmath53where @xmath54    we note that the coupling constants and mode density appear in the integral equation only in the form @xmath55 .",
    "these forms are called reservoir structure functions , as they contain all the essential features of the reservoir and its coupling to the atomic system . specifically , the reservoir structure functions that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ c32.1.2 ] ) and ( [ c32.1.3 ] ) are @xmath56as the coupling constants are proportional to dipole matrix elements multiplied by the square root of the angular frequency , it is clear that the factors @xmath57 and @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( c32.1.3 ) are independent of the frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence a third reservoir structure function involving the factor @xmath60 is not needed . as the dipole matrix elements would essentially cancel out ,",

    "furthermore , the solutions obtain their particular form from just the reservoir structure functions , rather than the density of states or coupling constants alone .",
    "next we see that in the new notation eq .",
    "( [ c27.2a ] ) becomes @xmath62and again the step to obtaining @xmath39 just involves using the reservoir structure function @xmath63 .",
    "note again that @xmath64 is a function of the laplace variable @xmath30 , so the decay of the initial atomic state @xmath2 described by @xmath41 is non - exponential in general .",
    "finally , we note eqs .",
    "( [ c27.2c ] ) and ( [ c27.2d ] ) imply that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are fully determined once @xmath67 are known , and @xmath68 ( eq . ( [ c27.2 ] ) ) introduces no new frequency dependence as it is independent of frequency .",
    "thus all the reduced amplitudes @xmath69 , and @xmath66 can be determined in principle from reservoir structure functions . as we will see next ,",
    "this is sufficient to determine the reduced density operator describing the atomic system .",
    "note that the non - markovian methods could be applied both to photonic band - gap and high q cavity cases , since the general equations ( [ c32.2]-[c38.3 ] ) defining the solution only depend on the reservoir structure functions and not on the specific type of structured reservoir involved .",
    "markovian results can be obtained under conditions where the reservoir structure functions @xmath70 are slowly varying functions of @xmath4 .",
    "certain integrals give a constant term whose imaginary parts are the ( formally divergent ) frequency shifts and whose real parts are the decay rates for the states @xmath71 and @xmath2 .",
    "the atomic density operator is defined by @xmath72and it is not difficult to show that @xmath73thus we see that the atomic operator only depends on the reduced amplitudes @xmath74 , and the reservoir structure functions . as the former can be determined , in principle , from the reservoir structure functions , we see that the behaviour of the cascade atom in the structured reservoir is completely determined by the reservoir structure functions ( for the initial state given in eq .",
    "( eq : initial_state ) ) .    on the basis of this key result",
    ", it would follow that any existing system could be replaced by an equivalent system , provided that the reservoir structure functions were the same in both models .",
    "this is the basis of the treatment of superradiance in a photonic band gap continuum @xcite , where the photonic band gap system is replaced by a pair of degenerate cavity modes coupled to the multi - atom system and with each other , one of the modes being also coupled to a markovian bath . in terms of the treatment in @xcite , such a case would produce the required fano - profile reservoir structure function , with the fano window representing the photonic band gap .",
    "the two cavity modes would correspond to two pseudo - modes .",
    "the absence of any coherence terms in the atomic density operator is a consequence of the choice of initial state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : initial_state ] ) .",
    "the choice of a more general initial state ( even with no photons present ) of the form@xmath75would require the introduction of a more general time dependent state vector @xmath76 than that given in eq .",

    "the amplitudes for these additional states are not coupled to those for the other states included in eq .",
    "( [ c25.1 ] ) .",
    "again , the solutions for these amplitudes just involve reservoir structure functions and are analogous to those already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the simpler case of a two level atom coupled to a structured reservoir .",
    "however , as indicated above , the atomic density operator would then include coherence terms .",
    "the integral equation ( [ c32.2 ] ) can be solved in different ways .",
    "these include : ( a ) numerical methods based on converting the integral equation to a matrix equation , ( b ) expansions using biorthogonal eigenfunctions and ( c ) expansions such as the fredholm expansion @xcite .",
    "only the first of these methods will be used here , but as the second approach using biorthogonal eigenfunctions may be used in later work and has not been used previously in quantum optics problems , it is included here in appendices sec : appa - [ sec : appd ] for completeness .      as an illustration we consider a greatly simplified example of a three - level system coupled to a reservoir with structure .",
    "the simplest possible case is that for the same lorentzian reservoir structure function associated with both transitions , with all the couplings and transition frequencies equal to each other .",
    "that is , we choose a single coupling constant @xmath79 such that @xmath80which amounts to both the dipole moment matrix elements for the transitions being equal .",
    "the atom will also have two equally spaced transitions which are resonant with the reservoir structure , @xmath81we refer only to @xmath82 in the following .",
    "thus for the single reservoir structure function , we have @xmath83as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 represents the strength of the coupling and @xmath85 represents the width of the reservoir structure function .",
    "this situation would apply for identical cascade transitions coupled to a single high q cavity mode .",
    "cascade transitions in a photonic band gap reservoir would be treated via a different choice of the reservoir structure functions .    using this expression for the reservoir structure function we can determine the functions @xmath86 and @xmath51 in eqs .",
    "( [ c32.1.2]-[c32.1 ] ) and then the kernel , eq .",
    "( c33.3 ) , becomes @xmath87where @xmath88 is a quadratic polynomial such that @xmath89    for this model we thus have an analytic form for the kernel , but to go further it appears that we need to use a numerical method .",
    "we could utilize an eigenfunction method , such as that of appendix [ sec : appd ] , but choose a very simple approach to solve eq .",
    "( [ c33.2 ] ) .",
    "the process is simply to represent eq .",
    "( [ c33.2 ] ) as a matrix equation @xmath90where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are matrices and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are vectors .",

    "similarly , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are represented at discrete frequency points . from the definition in eq .",
    "( [ c32.1.1 ] ) , we see that if we introduce the function @xmath100 ( which we denote as @xmath101 for short ) via @xmath102\\;b_{1\\lambda } ( t),\\]]then @xmath103 is the function whose laplace transform is @xmath104 .",
    "however , in order to obtain the real and imaginary parts of @xmath103 , we will need the separate inverse laplace transforms @xmath105 which are the laplace transforms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath106 .",
    "for complex @xmath30 the latter laplace transforms _ can not _ be obtained by just writing @xmath107 as the sum of its real and imaginary parts .",
