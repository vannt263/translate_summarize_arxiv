    "this spatial correspondence suggests a correlation between average local dynamics and average local structure that would be consistent with expectation : given the attractive interaction between a and b particles , an a particle with lower - than - average b coordination will be less tightly bound by its neighbors , and thus potentially more mobile , than one with higher - than - average b coordination .",
    "our main result is to present a quantification of the correlations of the dynamic propensity as they occur in real space . as shown above , these correlations continue to have a significant @xmath63 dependence on the largest length scales accessible in our system of @xmath18 particles .",
    "previous simulation studies  @xcite of the ka liquid that address dh typically consider systems for which @xmath108 ranges from @xmath109 to @xmath110 particles , and so our system is comparable to the largest systems in this range .",
    "the notable exceptions are the recent works that study systems of @xmath111  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite particles .",
    "our work shows that a definitive study of the correlations of the dynamic propensity should be undertaken in a system much larger than that used here .",
    "this includes studies conducted at high @xmath0 , i.e. up to twice @xmath112 or even higher . if it is true that the length scale of the dynamic propensity and the length scale of dh as found in conventional averaging are the same , then our results support the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite that systems very much larger than ours are required in order to study dh in a regime that is beyond the influence of finite - size effects , even at high @xmath0 .",
    "the same conclusion is even more strongly supported by the behavior of the coordination propensity ; these correlations span our system size at all @xmath0 studied , including @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that since our main results are based on isoconfigurational averaging , the structural triggers for individual correlated dynamical events occurring in a single simulation run ( e.g. the `` strings '' of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are not specifically addressed here .",
    "isoconfigurational averaging quantifies the _ tendency _ for a particular property ( a displacement or a coordination number ) to be observed , but has very limited predictive power for any given run  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to recognize that the correlations exposed via isoconfigurational averaging are properties of the initial configuration from which the runs of the isoconfigurational ensemble are generated .",
    "that is , they are _",
    "static _ correlations in the sense that they are a property determined by the configuration of particles in an instantaneous snapshot of the system  @xcite . at the same time , the role of the subsequent dynamical evolution of the ensemble of systems initiated from the original configuration in revealing these correlations can not be ignored .",
    "it is the sensitivity of the dynamics to the initial configuration that reveals the spatial heterogeneity observed in the propensity . in short , isoconfigurational",
    "averaging provides us with a _ dynamically - revealed _ static correlation , but a static correlation nonetheless . in this light , the large - scale correlations ( that is , large compared to our system size ) that we observe in the dynamic propensity , and especially in the coordination propensity at @xmath4 , indicate the existence of subtle configurational fluctuations in the ka liquid that are larger than has perhaps been generally appreciated .",
    "the nature of these structural fluctuations clearly merits further study , for example , in terms of fluctuations of local composition or medium - range order that occur without accompanying density fluctuations , as examined in the recent work of tanaka and coworkers  @xcite .    in all glass - forming liquids ,",
    "the increasing sensitivity of dynamics to structure as @xmath0 decreases makes it inevitable that local dynamical fluctuations ( i.e. dh ) will occur on a scale at least up to the size of any local structural fluctuations that are present . the spatial extent of the fluctuations we find in the coordination propensity are comparable to our system size at all @xmath0 studied , and",
    "as described above , these fluctuations are necessarily structural in origin .",
    "our results therefore suggest that the occurrence of dh in the ka liquid can be understood as a response , progressively emerging as @xmath0 decreases , of the local dynamics to subtle but large - scale structural fluctuations that are already well - established at high @xmath0 .",
    "while power law growth of the size of mobile clusters in single runs is well known , our results show that the immobile clusters also exhibit a power law growth with approximately the same exponent as for mobile clusters ."
