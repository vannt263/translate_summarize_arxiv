    "in non - central heavy - ion collisions the initial spatial anisotropy of the collision region translates into a final state anisotropy in momentum space . in a hydrodynamical picture this is believed to be due to pressure gradients in the dense medium which lead to collective motion  so called transverse flow  of the generated particles .",
    "the simplest way of characterizing these final state anisotropies is to perform a fourier decomposition on the particle s emission angles @xmath4 with respect to the reaction plane @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the reaction plane is given by the incident beam direction and the impact parameter and it is experimentally not known _ a priori_. it has to be estimated for every event by looking at the anisotropy of particle emission itself  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a finite resolution of the measured event plane which one has to correct for .",
    "spurious contributions to the measured transverse flow signal are particle correlations due to non - flow effects ( e.g.  resonance decays ) . to cope with these",
    ", several new methods of the anisotopic flow analysis , based either on cumulants  @xcite or on lee - yang zeros  @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "the two forward tpcs ( ftpcs  @xcite ) of the star experiment  @xcite extend the pseudorapidity coverage of star into the region @xmath6 .",
    "the pseudorapidity resolution of these radial drift chambers is better than 5% for their full acceptance . during rhic run 2",
    "about 70  thousand au+au collisions at a center of mass energy of @xmath7gev were taken with both ftpcs and the star tpc  @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of directed flow at rhic energies was recently published  @xcite ( see fig .  [ v1 ] ) .",
    "it showed that while @xmath9 is close to zero at mid - rapidities , the signal rises to a couple of percent near pseudorapidity @xmath10 .",
    "it was noted that our measurement greatly differs from the na49 results  @xcite at lower beam energies of @xmath11gev .",
    "but if the na49 data are shifted and both measurements are seen in the projectile frame , they look similar .",
    "the comparison of our new measurement on elliptic flow @xmath12 at forward pseudorapidities confirms the published result  @xcite obtained by the phobos collaboration ( see fig .",
    "[ v2phobos ] ) at high @xmath13 .",
    "we observe a similar fall - off by a factor of 1.8 comparing @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "both measurements were done using the event plane method .",
    "if we compare our results for @xmath1 obtained with the method of two - particle cumulants , @xmath16 , to the four - particle cumulants , @xmath17 , we observe almost no difference in the ftpc region , while the two - particle cumulant measurement gives a 15% higher signal in the tpc .",
    "since four - particle cumulants are much less prone to non - flow contributions we conclude that non - flow effects are less strong in the forward regions .      from the above measurements it became clear that the star tpc sitting at mid - rapidity has very good capabilities to measure elliptic flow , while the forward tpcs allow to measure directed flow ( which appears to be close to zero at mid - rapidities ) .      in order to utilize the method of fourier decomposition but to reduce non - flow contributions at the same time , we measured @xmath8 with respect to the first and second order reaction plane @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath19 was determined in the ftpcs while @xmath20 was measured in the tpc . within the recently proposed notation ( see  @xcite ) we denote this measurement as @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath21    as shown in fig .",
    "[ v1ep1ep2 ] , the results are in reasonable agreement with the published measurement obtained by the three - particle cumulant method @xmath22 .",
    "this new method provides an elegant tool to measure the sign of @xmath1 , which was assumed to be positive but had not yet been determined at rhic energies .",
    "one of the quantities involved in the measurement of @xmath23 is approximately equal to the product of integrated values of @xmath24 and @xmath1 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denote the multiplicities for a given centrality bin in the two ftpcs and the tpc , respectively .",
    "since @xmath24 is always positive , the sign of @xmath29 determines the sign of @xmath1 .    averaged over centralities",
    "2060% we measure @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ v1v1v2 ] to be @xmath31 . in this region",
    "the expected non - flow contributions are much smaller than for the most central and peripheral centrality bins .",
    "therefore the sign of @xmath1 is determined to be positive : _ in - plane _ elliptic flow is confirmed .",
    "( this stated value for @xmath30 and its uncertainty is based on an approximation that does not affect the statistical significance of the conclusion that @xmath1 is _ in - plane_. )      since elliptic flow @xmath1 is strong , the second order reaction plane @xmath20 can be estimated with high precision at rhic energies .",
    "this makes the study of higher order flow feasible  @xcite .",
    "the fourth harmonic @xmath2 shows an average value of @xmath32 in pseudorapidity coverage of the tpc ( @xmath33 ) , see fig .",
    "in contrast , its value of @xmath34 in the forward regions is consistent with zero and we place a @xmath35 upper limit of 0.2% . therefore the fall - off of @xmath2 from mid - rapidities to forward rapidities appears to be stronger than for @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with scaling like @xmath36 .",
    "first attempts to make use of the newly proposed method  @xcite utilizing lee - yang zeros are encouraging .",
    "this method eliminates higher order non - flow contributions by construction .",
    "it is mathematically equivalent to the _",
    "all_-particle cumulant method @xmath37 which takes into account all higher order non - flow effects .",
    "the great advantage of the new method is its simplicity and speed compared to the evaluation of the cumulants ."
