    "our knowledge of the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has greatly increased as a result of recent detections of x - ray , optical , and radio counterparts .",
    "x - ray observations of several grbs including but not limited to grb  970228 and grb  970508 by bepposax @xcite and grb  970828 by xte / asca @xcite have provided precise localizations which have allowed for deep optical follow - up searches .",
    "these searches have resulted in the identification of two grb optical counterparts , namely grb  970228 @xcite and grb  970508 @xcite and a single radio counterpart , grb  970508 @xcite . despite the wealth of information that has been obtained from these discoveries , the physical mechanisms which cause a gamma - ray burst remain a mystery .",
    "the lack of a bright host galaxy for either optical counterpart has further confused matters .",
    "although the identification of the `` hurley 100 '' @xcite may pin down the nature of the afterglows , multiwavelength observations of grbs _ simultaneous _ with the gamma - ray emission may be a more direct method of probing their origin . if the physical processes which produce the prompt gamma - ray emission and the lower energy afterglow differ , as katz and piran @xcite have suggested , a broad band spectrum revealing the nature of the source environment can only be produced from simultaneous observations .",
    "small , wide field - of - view telescopes , such as lotis , which were originally designed to provide more precise burst locations by detecting the simultaneous optical emission may assist in producing or constraining this broad band spectrum .",
    "lotis is a second generation simultaneous optical counterpart search experiment .",
    "the precursor experiment , called gamma - ray optical counterpart search experiment ( grocse ) , found no evidence of simultaneous optical activity brighter than m@xmath5 @xcite .",

    "a detailed description of the system is provided in park _",
    "_ @xcite as well as at http://hubcap.clemson.edu/@xmath13ggwilli / lotis/.    from the start of routine operation in early october 1996 through early october 1997 lotis has responded to 36 gcn / batse grb triggers @xcite .",
    "six of these triggers were a result of particle events occurring in the batse detectors .",
    "two triggers were caused by known soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) . of the remaining 28 triggers",
    "26 were unique grbs while two were refined coordinates of previously triggered grbs ( gcn locburst ) .",
    "of the 26 unique triggers 7 were considered _",
    "good _ events subject to the criteria of clear weather conditions , @xmath2 s response time , and @xmath3% coverage of the final batse 3@xmath4 error circle . by far",
    "the hardest criterion to meet was the coverage criterion owing to the difficulty in determining accurate grb locations from the first few seconds of gamma - ray emission . based on these statistics",
    "lotis responds to @xmath14 good grb event every 52 days .",
    "data from the seven good events which lotis responded to is given in table [ t : ggwilli:1 ] .",
    "the fluence values were determined by summing the fluence in the four energy channels given in the current batse grb catalog with the exception of triggers 6100 and 6414 which are discussed below .",
    "the fourth column gives the statistical error in the final batse postion while the fifth column gives the angular difference between the initial and final batse coordinates .",
    "the lotis response time and the total duration of the burst are given in the last two columns . in four cases lotis began imaging while gamma - rays were still being emitted making the observations truly simultaneous .",
    "the event with the largest gamma - ray fluence was grb  970223 which was among the top 3% of all batse grbs .",
    "although no optical transients were identified for this burst lotis placed an upper limit on the ratio of optical flux at 700 nm to gamma - ray flux at 100 kev of @xmath15 and on the ratio of optical to gamma - ray fluence of @xmath16 .",
    "the full analysis of this event is given in park _",
    "_ @xcite .    the longest burst which lotis responded to was grb  971006 .",
    "this burst had a main pulse duration of @xmath17 s but exhibited weak pre- and post - burst emission resulting in a total duration of @xmath18 s. the light curve of grb  971006 is shown in figure  [ f : ggwilli:1 ] .",
    "lotis began imaging the field centered on the initial gcn coordinates ( ra = 241.1 , dec = 49.2 j2000 ) @xmath19 s after the start of the burst .",
    "the shaded region of figure  [ f : ggwilli:1 ] represents the 10 s integration time of the first lotis image .",
    "the final batse coordinates of grb  971006 ( ra = 249.8 , dec = 53.3 ) were well within the lotis field - of - view .",
    "figure  [ f : ggwilli:2 ] shows the lotis coverage for this burst .",
    "the small and large ellipses represent the batse 1@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 error circles ( including the 1.6@xmath20 systematic error ) respectively .",
    "there was no interplanetary network ( ipn ) @xcite localization available for this burst and therefore it was necessary to search the entire 3@xmath4 error circle for transient objects .",
    "this search found no transients with a point spread function ( psf ) consistent with the stellar psf .    from a histogram plot of stellar magnitudes in camera 3",
    "we determined the completeness magnitude ( the faintest magnitude for which 100% of the stars were detected ) for this event to be m@xmath21 . following the analysis in park _",
    "@xcite this yields an upper limit to the flux density at 700 nm of @xmath22 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath23  hz@xmath23 .",
    "the batse flux density at 100 kev was found by fitting the spectrum from lad3 during the integration time of the first lotis image to the band grb functional form @xcite which yielded a value of @xmath24 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath23  hz@xmath23 .",
    "the resulting upper limit of the optical to gamma - ray flux for this event is @xmath25 .",
    "the total gamma - ray fluence was determined by integrating the band grb functional form for the entire burst from 20 kev to 2000 kev .",
    "the total gamma - ray fluence was @xmath26 erg  @xmath8 while the upper limit to the grb s optical fluence , again following park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is @xmath27 erg  @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting upper limit for the optical to gamma - ray fluence ratio is @xmath28 .",
    "although lotis has already placed upper limits on the simultaneous optical to gamma - ray flux for specific events we hope to further constrain the ratio with an upgrade to thermo - electric cooled ccds in january 1998 . in the future we plan to investigate grb spectral evolution focusing on how the low energy power law index , @xmath29 , of the band grb functional form @xcite effects optical constraints .",
    "we also plan to implement super - lotis @xcite , a dedicated 0.6 m reflector with a design sensitivity of m@xmath30 ( 10 s integration time ) early next year .",
