    "the motion of a heavy rigid body about a fixed point is one of the most famous problems of classical mechanics @xcite . in 1750",
    "euler @xcite derived the equations of motion , which now bear his name , and described what is nowadays known as the euler - poinsot case because of the geometrical description given by poinsot about hundred years later @xcite .",
    "it was jacobi @xcite who integrated this case by using the elliptic functions which he had developed ( along with legendre , abel and gauss @xcite ) and mastered @xcite  we have translated this fundamental text into italian and commented extensively @xcite .",
    "+ more than 200 years later , in 1963 , a paper was published @xcite in which was presented a system of three ordinary differential equations .",
    "the author considered a hydrodynamical system developed by rayleigh @xcite and reduced it by applying a double fourier series as in @xcite .",
    "thus he obtained what nowadays is the famous lorenz system @xcite .",
    "three parameters are part of the lorenz system . for particular values of those parameters",
    "the lorenz system can be integrated in closed form by means of jacobi elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "we call this system the lorenz integrable system .",
    "+ in january 2001 the first whiteman prize for notable exposition on the history of mathematics was awarded to thomas hawkins by the american mathematical society . in the citation , published in the notices of ams * 48 * 416 - 417 ( 2001 ) , one reads that thomas hawkins ",
    "@xmath0 has written extensively on the history of lie groups .",
    "in particular he has traced their origins to [ lie s ] work in the 1870s on differential equations @xmath0 the _ ide fixe _ guiding lie s work was the development of a galois theory of differential equations @xmath0 [ hawkins s book @xcite ] highlights the fascinating interaction of geometry , analysis , mathematical physics , algebra and topology @xmath0 \" . also hawkins had established ",
    "the nature and extent of jacobi s influence upon lie \" @xcite .",
    "+ in the introduction of his book @xcite olver wrote that  it is impossible to overestimate the importance of lie s contribution to modern science and mathematics .",
    "nevertheless anyone who is already familiar with [ it ] @xmath1 is perhaps surprised to know that its original inspirational source was the field of differential equations \" .",
    "+ lie s monumental work on transformation groups , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and in particular contact transformations @xcite , led him to achieve his goal @xcite . +",
    "many books have been dedicated to this subject and its generalizations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "+ lie group analysis is indeed the most powerful tool to find the general solution of ordinary differential equations .",
    "any known integration technique can be shown to be a particular case of a general integration method based on the derivation of the continuous group of symmetries admitted by the differential equation , i.e. the lie symmetry algebra .",
    "in particular bianchi s theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) states that , if an admitted @xmath2-dimensional solvable lie symmetry algebra is found , then the general solution of the corresponding @xmath3-order system of ordinary differential equations can be obtained by quadratures .",
    "the admitted lie symmetry algebra can be easily derived by a straightforward although lengthy procedure .",
    "as computer algebra software becomes widely used , the integration of systems of ordinary differential equations by means of lie group analysis is becoming easier to perform",
    ". a major drawback of lie s method is that it is useless when applied to systems of @xmath2 first - order equations , because they admit an infinite number of symmetries , and there is no systematic way to find even an one - dimensional lie symmetry algebra , apart from trivial groups like translations in time admitted by autonomous systems .",
    "one may try to derive an admitted @xmath2-dimensional solvable lie symmetry algebra by making an ansatz on the form of its generators .",
    "+ however , in @xcite we have remarked that any system of @xmath2 first - order equations could be transformed into an equivalent system where at least one of the equations is of second - order .",
    "then the admitted lie symmetry algebra is no longer infinite - dimensional , and nontrivial symmetries of the original system could be retrieved @xcite .",
    "this idea has been successfully applied in several instances ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "also in @xcite we have have shown that first integrals can be obtained by lie group analysis even if the system under study does not come from a variational problem , i.e. , without making use of noether s theorem @xcite .",
    "if we consider a system of first - order equations and , by eliminating one of the dependent variables , derive an equivalent system which has one equation of second - order , then lie group analysis applied to that equivalent system yields the first integral(s ) of the original system which do(es ) not contain the eliminated dependent variable .",
    "of course this requires that such first integrals exist .",
    "the procedure should be repeated as many times as there are dependent variables in order to find all such first integrals .",
    "the first integrals correspond to the characteristic curves of determining equations of parabolic type which are constructed by the method of lie group analysis .",
    "we remark that interactive ( not automatic ) programs for calculating lie symmetries such as @xcite and @xcite are more appropriate for performing this task .",
    "+ we have briefly sketched three apparently unrelated subjects . in this paper",
    "we show that the lorenz system and the euler equations are actually related by means of lie group analysis .",
    "+ in @xcite we applied lie group analysis to a third - order differential equation , which is equivalent to the lorenz integrable system , and obtained a two - dimensional lie symmetry algebra , which we then used to integrate the lorenz integrable system in terms of jacobi elliptic functions . here",
    "we show that the same lie symmetry algebra is admitted by a third - order differential equation which is equivalent to the euler equations of a torque - free rigid body moving about a fixed point",
    ". then a transformation is easily derived by which the lorenz integrable system becomes the euler equations of a torque - free rigid body moving about a fixed point .",
    "thus , it can be stated that ",
    "the lorenz integrable system moves  la poinsot \" .",
    "+ if the same transformation is applied to the lorenz system with any value of parameters , then one obtains the euler equations of a rigid body moving about a fixed point and subjected to a torsion depending on time and angular velocity .",
    "the numerical solution of this system yields a three - dimensional picture which resembles a  tornado \" the cross - section of which has a butterfly - shape . by means of our transformation",
    "lorenz s _ butterfly _ becomes a _",
