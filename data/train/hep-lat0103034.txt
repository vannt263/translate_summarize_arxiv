    "the perturbative description of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) breaks down even at very high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is the generation of different length ( time ) scales at finite temperature . at high temperatures ( @xmath0 ) the gauge coupling",
    "constant is small @xmath1 and well separated length scales exist : @xmath2 . for such high temperatures the region of applicability of the perturbation theory",
    "is established . while for distances smaller than @xmath3 the ordinary perturbation theory should be applicable , at distances smaller than @xmath4 the hard thermal loop resummed perturbation theory @xcite should be applied . for distances larger than @xmath5 , however , perturbation theory is no longer valid @xcite . for interesting temperatures up to a few times @xmath6 , however , @xmath7 and it is not clear up to which distances ( times ) the perturbation theory is applicable . at short distances @xmath8",
    "one expects that medium effects are not important .",
    "for such small distances one should also expect the ordinary perturbation theory to be viable , because at zero temperature perturbation theory works at short distances .",
    "naturally the question arises : at what distances the medium effects become important and up to which distance perturbation theory is applicable ? in the present work we try to answer these questions by studying the heavy quark potential and temporal quark and gluon propagators in coulomb gauge .",
    "we consider the color averaged heavy quark potential defined by @xmath9.\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the polyakov loop ( @xmath11 is the temporal extent of the lattice ) .",
    "so far most studies have concentrated on the long distance behavior of the heavy quark potential ( @xmath12 ) . for the physics of heavy quarkonia at finite temperature ,",
    "however , it is important to know the potential for @xmath13 . in order to explore the short distance behavior of the heavy quark potential we performed simulations on @xmath14 lattices with the standard wilson action at two different temperatures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as well as on @xmath17 lattices with a tree level symanzik",
    "improved action for @xmath18 .",
    "the color averaged potential one actually calculates the heavy quark free energy . ]",
    "is related to the singlet ( @xmath19)and octet ( @xmath20 ) heavy quark potentials by the well - known formula @xcite @xmath21 at very short distances @xmath22 one would expect that the singlet and octet potentials are given by their perturbative zero temperature expressions @xmath23 , with @xmath24 for the singlet and @xmath25 for the octet case .",
    "thus for small distances one would expect @xmath26 .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) up to @xmath27 one recovers the well known perturbative result for the color averaged potential @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) couples the perturbative expansion to the high temperature expansion and therefore the above formula is obviously not valid at very short distances where @xmath29 .",
    "motivated by the leading order perturbative result we define an effective coupling @xmath30^{-2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath31 $ ] denotes the lattice coulomb potential .",
    "our results on @xmath32 are summarized in fig .",
    "one can see that there is a narrow region in @xmath33 where @xmath34 is approximately constant as one would expect from the leading order perturbative result .",
    "we also note that in this region of @xmath33 @xmath32 decreases with temperature as one would expect for the running coupling constant . for temperatures",
    "@xmath35 the effective coupling seems to decrease at small distances @xmath36 which may imply that in this region the potential behaves like @xmath37 according to the arguments given above . for higher temperatures the @xmath37 behavior sets in at smaller distances because the coupling @xmath38 is smaller and the high temperature expansion works well even at shorter distances .",
    "this probably is the reason that this behavior so far is not seen in our data for @xmath39 which are restricted by the lattice spacing @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 . for distances",
    "@xmath44 the effective coupling decreases with increasing @xmath33 which implies the onset of screening .",
    "thus we can distinguish three different regions of @xmath33 which are characterized by qualitatively different behavior of @xmath45 : the `` true '' short distance region where @xmath46 , the intermediate perturbative region @xmath47 and the `` large '' distance region where screening sets in .    a b +    lattice with the wilson action , others correspond to the data obtained on a @xmath48 lattice with an improved action .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   lattice with the wilson action , others correspond to the data obtained on a @xmath48 lattice with an improved action . , title=\"fig : \" ]    we note that for the lowest temperature @xmath49 the behavior of @xmath45 is compatible with @xmath50 for @xmath51 which may imply that the effect of screening is very small . to quantify the effects of screening at higher temperatures it is useful to define an effective screening mass @xmath52^{-2}/\\alpha^2(t))/r$ ] with @xmath53 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath54 as function of @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "as one can see from the figure the effective screening masses increase with increasing distance but up to distances @xmath56 do not reach a plateau which can be identified with the true screening mass .",
    "in fact this behavior of the effective screening masses could be explained qualitatively in perturbation theory if one takes into account the momentum dependence of the gluon self energy @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "note that the local screening masses in fig .",
    "1b are always smaller than screening masses extracted from the large distance behavior of the heavy quark potential in @xcite @xmath58 .",
    "they are also smaller than the perturbative debye screening mass @xmath59 if @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 .",
    "we thus conclude that the color averaged heavy quark potential has a complex structure for interesting distances , @xmath62 , and temperatures a few times @xmath6 .",
    "the temporal quark and gluon propagators are related to properties of quasi - particles in the qgp .",
    "in fact , in hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation these propagators are dominated by quasi - particle poles . @xcite .",
    "the quasi - particle picture of qgp finds application in resummed perturbative calculations of different thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "we have performed simulations in quenched qcd with wilson fermions on a @xmath63 lattice at @xmath16 .",
    "we have used the standard wilson action for the gauge fields and an @xmath64 improved fermion action ( clover action ) .",
    "we have calculated the quark and gluon propagator @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) in mixed @xmath67 representation ( here @xmath68 is the absolute value of the spatial momentum ) .",
    "the propagator in this mixed representation can be related to the spectral function by @xmath69 . here ( @xmath66 ) and",
    "@xmath70 correspond to the case of quarks ( gluons ) . from the monte - carlo data for @xmath65",
    "we can extract the spectral functions @xmath71 with the help of the maximal entropy method ( mem ) @xcite . since the quark and gluon propagator are gauge dependent quantities one has to fix a gauge .",
    "we have fixed the coulomb gauge because in this gauge @xmath71 is positive which is necessary for mem .",
    "the peaks of the spectral function @xmath71 define the dispersion relation @xmath72 which is expected to be gauge invariant .",
    "since the smallest non - zero momentum @xmath73 is relatively large no detailed information about the properties of collective excitations like the longitudinal excitation in the gluon sector or the plasmino excitation in quark sector can be provided ( these excitations exist only in the small momentum region @xcite ) . here we will not extract the spectral function but postpone that for future publications .",
    "instead we compare our data for temporal quark and gluon propagators with the predictions of perturbation theory in htl approximation . in fig .",
    "2a we show our results for the transverse gluon propagator @xmath74 at momenta calculated on 40 gauge fixed configurations .",
    "we also show there the prediction of the htl approximation using a coupling constant @xmath75 suggested by the short distance behavior of the heavy - quark potential .",
    "as one can see from the figure the data disagree substantially with the htl prediction even at momenta @xmath76 .",
    "we note that corrections to the htl approximation will not resolve this discrepancy since they lead to smaller @xmath72 values shifting the propagator to values larger than the htl result @xcite .",
    "the quark propagator in mixed representation can be written as @xmath77 with @xmath78 . in the chiral limit ( @xmath79 )",
    "@xmath80 . for the value of the hopping parameter @xmath81 ( which corresponds to the quark mass close to the chiral limit ) used in our simulation",
    "we have found @xmath82 to be zero within the statistical accuracy reached in our simulations . in fig .",
    "2b we show our results for @xmath83 calculated on 40 configurations and compared with predictions of the htl approximation . as in the case of the gluon propagator we find large deviations from the htl predictions .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath84 .",
    "we have found that there is no choice of @xmath60 which can provide agreement between lattice results and htl .",
    "we thus conclude that at @xmath16 medium effects in temporal quark and gluon propagators are stronger than suggested by htl perturbation theory .      9 d.j .",
