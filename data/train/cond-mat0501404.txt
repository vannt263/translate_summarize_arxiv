    "it is well known that these linear diblock copolymers display a host of ordered phases : spheres , cylinders , lamella and the bicontinuous gyroid @xcite .",

    "the serial development of new chemical synthesis routes is typically a costly and slow means for exploring the consequences of novel copolymer architectures .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop theoretical tools for the efficient computation the phase behavior which can systematically map out novel phase properties for a broad class copolymer architectures .",

    "for asymmetric copolymers , say for @xmath6 , the effective spring constant of the more abundant polymer block is @xmath7 times more stiff than other block .",
    "such asymmetry leads an enhanced stability of phases with strong interfacial curvature , and thus , spherical and cylindrical micelles are predicted to dominate the phase behavior for large molecular asymmetry @xcite .",

    "our approach to multiply - branched diblocks is an extension of the scft approach to linear diblocks and starblock copolymers pioneered by matsen and schick @xcite . while the derivation of the mean - field free energy for the mulitply - branched system follows directly from the results for the linear and starblock architectures , we present its full derivation here since the subsequent evaluation of that free energy requires a slightly more generalized approach",

    "it is desirable to have a similar quantitative measure of the elastic asymmetry for copolymers with this multiply - branched structural motif .",
    "however , in contrast to the miktoarm star architecture , the elastic enhancement of multiply - branched domains depends on the aggregate morphology . using the alexander - de gennes , strong - segregation analysis employed by frischknecht and fredrickson we find , for example , that the stiffness of a lamellar b domain in these doubly - functional copolymer melts is enhanced by a factor of @xmath153 $ ] over the linear , unbranched case @xcite .",

    "we note the stability of the cubic a15 phase in these melts .",
    "we have argued @xcite that as @xmath3 and in the limit that the ab interface of a sphere phase is constrained to adopt the same shape as the lattice unit cell that the a15 should be the equilibrium structure . in this limit",
    "the relative stability of competing arrangements of micelles can be assessed purely in terms of two geometric moments of the voronoi polyhedra of the lattice : the area and the second - moment of the lattice .",
    "if @xmath164 measures the radial distance from the center to the surface of the voronoi cell of lattice @xmath165 at solid angle , @xmath166 , then we can compute the area in terms of the area of a spherical cell of equal volume , @xmath167 } { \\big(\\int d \\hat{\\omega } r^3_x ( \\hat{\\omega } ) \\big)^{2/3 } } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath168 .",

    "given these geometric measures for all candidate arrangements of spherical micelles we can assess the relative stability of these phases in this limit where ab interface has the same shape as the unit cell of the lattice .",
    "it was discovered by weaire and phelan that the space partition of the a15 lattice has the lowest area of all known equal volume periodic partitions of three dimensional space @xcite .",
    "it is for this reason , despite the fact that the bcc lattice has a smaller second moment , that the a15 lattice is most stable among the lattice arrangements of spherical micelles when ab interfaces have adopted the shape of the voronoi cell in which they are confined . in particular",
    ", this limit predicts that the free energy per chain for the a15 phase is 0.14% and 0.61% lower than the bcc and fcc phases , respectively .",
    "of course , there are finite @xmath8 corrections to this asymptotic limit due to chain fluctuations which are neglected in the strong - segregation limit , but the lowest order corrections which distinguish between morphologies are smaller than the leading order free energy term by a factor of @xmath172 @xcite",
    ".    the conclusions of our sst analysis are valid in the limit that the ab interface has adopted the polyhedral shape of the lattice voronoi cell .",
    "it is well known that constraining a micelle to occupy a polyhedral unit cell frustrates the internal configuration of the aggregate @xcite .",
    "chains which extend along directions towards corners of the voronoi cell must stretch further than those extending towards the walls .",
    "the difference in tension in these chains leads to a tendency to distort the ab interface from its ideal , uniformly curved shape into the polyhedral shape of the voronoi cell .",
    "of course , the micelle will adopt some compromise between the uniform curvature and relaxed outer chain stretching which will be determined by the relative importance of outer chain stretching and the forces which pull inward on the ab interface , namely the surface tension and the inner chain stretching .",
    "we demonstrated @xcite how the tendency for cylindrical micelles in the hex phase to adopt an hexagonal interface shape is enhanced both by an increase in inner domain volume fraction , @xmath16 , and the elastic asymmetry between the coronal and core polymer domains , @xmath173 .",
    "in particular , we found that although ab interfaces in micelles for symmetric molecules ( e.g. linear ab diblocks ) remain relatively unperturbed by the lattice symmetry , cylindrical micelles composed of very elastically asymmetric copolymers ( @xmath174 ) have interfaces which are very nearly hexagonal in regions where the hex phase is thermodynamically stable .",
    "given the stability of the a15 phase in the present system ( figure [ fig : branchedphase ] ) , it must be that the interfaces of the sphere phases are also substantially distorted by the polyhedral environment of the lattice voronoi cell .",
    "we can quantify the extent to which ab interfaces in sphere phases adopt the shape of the voronoi cells from our scft results .",
    "a measure of the distortion of the interface of a micelle in the bcc phase from the ideal spherical shape is the difference of the distances from the center of the micelle to the interface along directions towards the closest face of the voronoi cell , the ( 111 ) direction , and towards the corner of the voronoi cell , the ( 210 ) direction , @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are the radial distances to the ab interface along those directions ( see figure [ fig : cutaway ] ) . for a spherical interface",
    "we have @xmath178 and for an interface which as the truncated - octahedron shape of the bcc voronoi cell , @xmath179 . by normalizing measured values of @xmath180 by @xmath181",
    ", we can assess the polyhedral distortion on the scale set by the shape of the bcc voronoi cell .",
    "therefore , we use , @xmath182 to quantify the polyhedral distortion of the interface as a function of molecular architecture .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] plots the shape parameter , @xmath183 , measured from sfct calculations for the bcc phase as function of @xmath16 and branching generation @xmath184 .",
    "it is clear that the packing frustration introduced by the polyhedral voronoi cell increases as the volume fraction of the core of the micelle grows .",
    "although the close - packing limit of hard spheres in a bcc lattice is at a volume fraction of @xmath185 , the cores of the micelles are highly deformed for @xmath16 well below this .",
    "since the outer chain stretching is responsible for this polyhedral distortion , the tendency to adopt the truncated - octahedral shape of the bcc lattice is enhanced as the stiffness of the coronal region is increased by molecular branching .    to further visualize this distortion we compute the mean - curvature , @xmath186 , of ab interfaces extracted from scft results for melts at @xmath143 at the phases boundary between spherical and cylindrical phasess , the a15-hex boundary , for @xmath146 , @xmath141 , and for linear diblocks .",
    "the distortion in these interfaces corresponds to measured values of @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "these surfaces are displayed in figure [ fig : curvature ] , and following the analysis of matsen and bates @xcite the interfaces are shaded according to the local mean - curvature . as the polyhedral distortion increases , the deviation from constant mean curvature grows .",
    "the surface tension , @xmath190 , associated with an interface between unlike polymer melt domain scales as @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "a patch of area , @xmath192 , of a curved interface experiences a force due the surface tension which is given by @xmath193 @xcite . since these micelle configurations are saddle - points of the free energy , we know that the force due to the tension pulling inward on the interface is balanced by a net force pulling outward on the micelle interface , that is , the interface must be in mechanical equilibrium . in copolymer",
    "micelles the compensating forces are due to a difference in the tension of the chains in the core and coronal domains",
    ". therefore , variation of the mean curvature of the interface provides a direct measure of the chain tension pulling on the interface .",
    "regions of high interfacial curvature , towards the edges and vertices of the bcc voronoi polyhedron , correspond to regions where the coronal b domains pull relatively strongly on the interface .",
    "conversely , relatively flat regions on the ab interface , towards the nearest - neighbor faces of the polyhedron , indicate that the chain stretching is relatively low .",
    "from our analysis we see that for elastically asymmetric copolymers the polyhedral shape of the lattice voronoi cell forces the micelle configuration to deviate drastically from the limit of uniform interfacial curvature . while we have argued that in the limit of perfectly polyhedral interfaces the a15 phase is most stable among the sphere phases and that very elastically asymmetric micelles approach this polyhedral limit in regions where sphere phases are thermodynamically stable , it has yet to be shown that for small distortions ( for @xmath194 ) the minimal voronoi cell area argument should apply .",
    "for example , the reduced area of the @xmath146 , bcc interface of figure [ fig : curvature ] is @xmath195 , to be compared to the reduced area of the truncated - octahedron of the bcc voronoi cell , @xmath196 . in this sense ,",
    "ab interfaces of physical micelles seems to be distorted less than about 10% towards their voronoi polyhedra .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the polyhedral interface limit of the micelle configurations sets the scale of the frustration . while the true micelle interfaces are some interpolation between a spherical and polyhedral shape , the scale of the frustrated free energy is set by the polyhedral interface upper bound . as mentioned above , in the limit of polyhedral interfaces as @xmath3 , sst predicts that @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "we can compare this prediction to the results of our scft calculations along the hex - a15 phase boundary at @xmath143 for @xmath159 branched copolymers ( at @xmath199 ) for which we find @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , corresponding to 0.28% and 0.46% higher free energy than the a15 phase for bcc and fcc phases , respectively . on the scale of these small free energy differences ,",
    "the analysis of our geometrical limit is a necessary component of any rational explanation for lattice choice .",
    "therefore , while such a calculation has yet be carried out , we expect that a more detailed sst analysis of the relaxed configurations of micelle interfaces will bear this argument out .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating discussions with d. discher , b. didonna , p. heiney , and v. percec .",

    "following matsen and schick @xcite we define a set of orthogonal basis functions , @xmath203 , which have the periodic symmetry of our copolymer phase .",
    "we expand all of the necessary functions of position in this basis , so that @xmath204 . for example , the bcc phase of spheres can be described by the set of functions with @xmath205 symmetry .",
    "the functions are normalized such that , @xmath206 in addition , we demand that these functions are eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator so that , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the length scale of the periodicity of the system .",
    "the set of functions is ordered in an increasing sequence in @xmath209 , and @xmath210 is set to 0 ( or @xmath211 ) . because the product of two basis functions , @xmath212 , has the all symmetries of the basis , it belongs in the same space of functions as our basis .",
    "thus , we can write the product as expansion in our basis functions .",
    "we define the coefficients , @xmath213 , of the expansion so that , @xmath214 alternately , given the set of basis functions invariant under all of the symmetry operations of the group , this coefficient can be computed by @xmath215 .    with these definitions and a finite fourier expansion of all functions of position we can rewrite the diffusion equation , ( 17 ) , as a matrix equation , @xmath216 where we have defined the matrices , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , @xmath219 @xmath220 since these are symmetric , real matrices we can diagonalize @xmath217 and @xmath218 by orthogonal transformations , such that , @xmath221_{ik } a_{kl }   [ o_a]_{lj } = \\mathcal{a}_i \\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath222_{ik } b_{kl } [ o_b]_{lj } = \\mathcal{b}_i \\delta_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the eigenvalues of @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and @xmath225_{ij}$ ] and @xmath226_{ij}$ ] are the orthogonal matrices which diagonalize , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , respectively .",
