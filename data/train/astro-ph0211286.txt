    "the idea of exploiting cosmic antiprotons measurements to probe unconventional particle physics and astrophysics scenarios has a long history [ 1 - 10 ] and moved the cosmologists for several decades . shortly after the discovery of the cp violation in the weak interactions in 64",
    ", sakharov formulated his famous hypotheses that were assumed to be a reasonable starting point to explain the apparent contradiction between the fundamental laws of the nature and the observations .",
    "several balloon borne experiments were dedicated to the search for antiparticles and antinuclei , and in the 70 s the teams of r.  golden in usa @xcite and of e.  bogomolov in russia @xcite identified the first antiprotons in cosmic rays ( the positrons were discovered more than 40 years before by anderson ) .",
    "then , the antiproton spectrum was intensively studied for searching for signals exceeding the background of the antiprotons produced in the interactions of cr s with the interstellar matter .    in figure  [ beaf90 ] ( on the left ) are shown the data on the antiproton / proton ratio before 1990 . at that time",
    "the standard production models ( black lines ) @xcite could not account for all the antiprotons measured by the golden et al . and",
    "buffington et al .",
    "@xcite experiments , and this triggered the formulation of many exotic models ranging from antiprotons coming from antigalaxies @xcite to annihilation of supersimmetric dark matter ( gray curve ) @xcite .    in the same years the results of the positron ratio measurements were somewhat similar , with the experiments giving an higher flux of positron at energies greater than 10 gev",
    "( see figure  [ beaf90 ] on the right ) , explained only with some exotic production , like again the annihilation of wimps giving a contribution as shown by the gray curve in the figure  [ beaf90 ] ( from @xcite ) .",
    "in the last decade there has been an increase of experiments performed using novel techniques developed for accelerator physics .",
    "this has permitted to improve the statistical and systematic significance of the experimental measurements .",
    "the wizard collaboration did several balloon flights , mass89@xcite , mass91@xcite , ts93@xcite , caprice94@xcite and caprice98@xcite , exploring an energy interval from some hundreds mev to 50 gev of the antiproton and positron spectra .",
    "the core parts of the instrument were a magnetic spectrometer composed by a superconducting magnet and a tracking system for charge sign and momentum measurements , an imaging calorimeter ( streamer tube or silicon tungsten ) and a @xmath1 selector ( cerenkov , trd or rich ) .    in figure  [ antip ]",
    "there are reported the data for the antiproton / proton ratio collected up to now , together with the data of heat - pbar @xcite , heat@xcite and imax92@xcite experiments .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are , respectively , the theoretical interstellar and solar modulated ratios for a pure secondary origin of the antiprotons .",
    "the others are more exotic models .    in figure  [ antipf ]",
    "there are the experimental results , including the ams data@xcite , for the antiproton flux along with different theoretical calculations which account for a pure secondary component@xcite and together with the distortion on the antiproton flux ( dashed line ) due to a possible contribution from neutralino annihilation ( dotted line , from@xcite ) .    in figure  [ pos ]",
    "there are the experimental data for the @xmath2 fraction together with the distortion ( solid line ) due to a possible contribution from neutralino annihilation ( dotted line , from@xcite ) .    the possibility to detect this kind of distortions and then the possibility to discover",
    "the nature of the dark matter is not so exotic as it might appear .    over the last years",
    "our knowledge of the inventory of matter and energy in the universe has improved dramatically .",
    "astrophysical measurements from several experiments are now converging and a standard cosmological model is emerging .",
    "for this model the total matter density is about 40%@xmath310% of the critical density of the universe , with a contribution of the baryonic dark matter less than 5% and a contribution from neutrinos that can not be greater than 5% .",
    "the remaining matter should be composed of yet - undiscovered weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) , and a good candidate for wimp s is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in r - parity conserving supersymmetric models .    the best candidate as lsps are the neutralinos .",
    "they are majorana fermions and annihilate with each other in the galactic halo producing leptons , quarks , gluons , gauge bosons and higgs bosons",
    ". these decay and/or form jets that will give rise to antiprotons ( and antineutrons which decay shortly to antiprotons ) , positrons and gammas . a description of the signature of the annihilation in gamma spectra can be found in  @xcite . from the figures  [ antipf ] and  [ pos ]",
    "it is clear that new experiments with better statistic are needed to discriminate among the models .",
    "an other goal of these experimens is the search of antinuclei .",
    "detection of heavy ( z@xmath42 ) antimatter of primary origin in cosmic rays would be a discovery of fundamental significance . that would provide direct evidence of the existence of antimatter in the universe .",
    "the current theory suggests that the remaining matter is the remnant of the almost complete annihilation of matter and antimatter at some early epoch , which stopped only when there was no more antimatter to annihilate .",
    "starting from a matter / antimatter symmetric universe , the required conditions for a following asymmetric evolution are the cp violation , the baryon number non - conservation and a non equilibrium environment . on the basis of gamma - ray observations , the coexistence of condensed matter and antimatter on scales smaller than that of clusters of galaxies has been virtually ruled out .",
    "however , no observations presently exclude the possibility that the domain size for establishing the sign of cp violation is as large as a cluster or super - cluster of galaxies .",
    "for example , there could be equality in the number of super - clusters and anti - super - clusters .",
    "similarly , there is nothing that excludes the possibility that a small fraction of the cosmic rays observed at earth reaching our galaxy from nearby super - clusters .",
    "up to now no antihelium or heavier antinucleus have been found ; in figure  [ antinu ] there are the present experimental limits and the sensitivities foreseen for the next experiments that will be discussed in the next paragraphs .",
    "three major experiments are being prepared for the future : the polar balloon bess instrument , the satellite pamela experiment and ams on the international space station .",
    "the pamela telescope , shown in figure  [ pamd ] , is a satellite - borne apparatus built by the wizard - pamela collaboration @xcite .",
    "the list of the people and the institution involved in the collaboration together with the on - line status of the project is available at _",
    "the pamela scientific primary goal is the search for heavy nuclei and non baryonic particles outside the standard model , for the understanding of the formation and evolution of our galaxy and the universe and for the exploring of the cycles of matter and energy in the universe .",
    "additional objectives of pamela are the studies of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere , solar flares , distribution and acceleration of solar cosmic rays ( scr s ) in the internal heliosphere , magnetosphere and magnetic field of the earth , stationary and disturbed fluxes of high energy particles in the earth s magnetosphere and anomalous components of cosmic rays .    0.2 cm the pamela observations will extend the results of balloon - borne experiments over an unexplored range of energies with unprecedented statistics and will complement the information gathered from the great space observatories .    more precisely , during its three years of planned operation , pamela will measure with very high statistics :    @xmath5 positron flux from 50 mev to 270 gev  ( present limits 0.7 - 30 gev )    @xmath5 antiproton flux from 80 mev to 190 gev   ( present limits 0.4 - 50 gev )    @xmath5 limit on antinuclei @xmath6   ( present limit about @xmath7 )    @xmath5 electron flux from 50 mev to 3tev    @xmath5 proton flux from 80 mev to 700 gev    @xmath5 light nuclei flux ( up to oxygen ) from 100 mev / n to 200 gev / n    @xmath5 electron and proton components up to 10 tev    in addition it will assure a continuous monitoring of the cosmic rays solar modulation    0.2 cm    as an example , the expected data from the experiment pamela in the annihilation scenario for three years of operation are shown by black squares in figure  [ pamela2 ] for both the positron and antiproton fluxes .      the pamela telescope , based on the experience gained in the wizard balloon flights and in the wizard@xcite on astromag and mass - sat @xcite proposals , is composed by : 0.2 cm    \\1 . a magnetic spectrometer to determine the sign of the electric charge and to measure the momentum of the particles .",
    "the magnetic system is composed by five permanent magnet of nd - fe - b , each 8 cm high , that provide a field inside the tracking volume of about 0.4 t. there are six planes of silicon micro - strip detectors for tracks reconstruction with a spatial resolution of 3 @xmath8 m in the bending view giving a maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) of 740 gv / c .",
    "@xmath5 a transition radiation detector ( trd ) for distinguishing at the level of @xmath9 between electromagnetic and hadronic showers from 1 gev to about 1 tev ; the trd is based on small diameter straw tubes filled with xe - co@xmath10 mixtures and arranged in double layer planes interleaved by carbon fiber radiator",
    ".    @xmath5 a @xmath11 silicon imaging calorimeter to discriminate at the level of @xmath12 between electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "it is composed by silicon strip sensors , interleaved with tungsten plates as converters .",
    "the energy resolution for positrons is of the order of 15% / e@xmath13 . in self triggering mode the calorimeter geometric factor",
    "is about 470 @xmath14 , allowing the measuring with useful statistics of the electron flux up to 2 tev .",
    "@xmath5 six scintillation counter ( each 7 mm thick ) hodoscopes for the event trigger and for tof measurements with a time resolution of @xmath15 110 ps to provide albedo discrimination and particle identification up to 3 gev / c .",
    "@xmath5 an additional plastic scintillator ( s4 in the figure[pamela2 ] ) and a neutron detector composed by 36 @xmath16he counters in a polyetilen moderator allow , together with the imaging calorimeter , to extend the energy range for primary protons and electrons up to 10 tev .",
    "@xmath5 a set of scintillation counters , covering part of the top edge , the lateral sides of the magnetic spectrometer and the bottom part of the calorimeter , completes the telescope , for a further labeling of contaminating events .",
    "others characteristics of the pamela instrument are :    \\1 . an acceptance ( geometrical factor ) of 20.5 @xmath17 sr ;    \\2 . a total volume of @xmath18 cm@xmath16 ;    \\3 . a total mass of 470 kg ;    \\4 .",
    "a power consumption of 360 w.    the pamela instrument will be installed onboard the russian resurs - dk1 satellite , built by tsskb - progress .",
