    "xrfs lack detectable gamma - ray emission , but are reminiscent of gamma - ray bursts in their time history .",

    "the watch data also need correction , because that instrument was not sensitive to softer x - rays , but in this case the overlap with other x - ray instruments is larger and hence the correction is not so critical .",
    "additionally , interstellar absorption , which can be safely neglected in most cases above 2  kev , is an important factor in the rosat and einstein bands , adding more uncertainty to the results .",

    "we have only lower ( the scan duration ) and upper ( the scan interval ) limits to the duration of the heao events .",
    "we estimated fluences for the heao-1 events by multiplying the measured flux by an assumed event duration .",
    "our initial estimate of event duration was taken as the geometric mean of the minimum possible fxt duration ( usually the scan duration of 10 - 60 sec ) and the maximum possible fxt duration , which is several hours for the a1 experiment and @xmath74000  s for the a2 experiment .    to quantify the transient statistics , we assume that they are distributed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the normalization at 1 crab@xmath3sec , and determine the parameters of this distribution with a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "in our first analysis , we assumed that the spectrum of the events was similar to the crab nebula , i.e. , a power law with photon index @xmath21 .",

    "note that it is impossible to determine whether all the events that make up this distribution fit our strict definition of occurring only once .",
    "if some of the fxts come from magnetic stars , rs cvns , or other nearby objects , they may indeed repeat .",
    "these repetitions would have been seen by heao-1 , ariel-5 , etc . if those instruments had better sky coverage or longer lifetimes .",
    "our distribution ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , 70% crab - like vs. 30% thermal spectra ) is shown on fig.2 .",

    "although the duration of the heao-1 events is quite uncertain , this uncertainty does not affect the overall distribution .",
    "we plot the backward - derived log n - log s assuming the geometric - mean time duration discussed above .",
    "but because the overall distribution has a slope close to 1 , changes in the assumed duration simply slide the log n - log s contribution from the heao-1 instruments up or down along the same curve .",
    "the dashed / dotted boundaries show the effect of changing the duration to the extreme possibilities on the heao-1 a2 log n - log s distribution .",
    "the rosat results from @xcite and einstein results from @xcite were not used to determine our net log n - log s distribution .",
    "however , they are plotted on fig.2 for comparison .",
    "we have translated the fluence measured in the rosat energy band to 2 - 10  kev by assuming a crab - like spectrum with negligible foreground absorption .",

    "fig.3 shows the sky distribution of the events used in fig.2 ( ariel , heao , and watch marked with crosses , and rosat and einstein events marked with triangles ) . the sky distribution is consistent with isotropy .",
    "the dipole moment of the distribution towards galactic center is 0.07@xmath100.08 , and the quadrupole moment is 0.31@xmath100.04 ( for an isotropic distribution the dipole moment is zero , and the quadrupole moment is 1/3 ) .",
    "we see no significant anisotropy for any subset of these data .",
    "however we need to note that there are no reliable exposure maps for mentioned above experiments , making it difficult to be definite about the lack of a disk population in these data .",

    "he estimated that the grb share of ariel-5 and heao-1 fxt events was about 50% .",
    "we wish to refine this estimate by bringing several parameters into our analysis .",

    "we consider the xdgrb estimate of @xmath2 to be more reliable than the ` batse ' estimate , because the ` batse ' @xmath2 ratio was calculated by extrapolation of band s parameters from the 20  kev-2  mev region , while for the xdgrb @xmath2 was actually measured , or calculated using band s parameters fit to 2  kev-700  kev measurements .",
    "the shift between the peaks of the two distributions is in the direction expected from selection effects ( see appendix ) .    to determine the integrated x - ray fluence from grbs",
    ", we need to consider not only the prompt emission , but also the afterglow emission ( the third and forth parameters mentioned at the beginning of this section ) .",
    "data from bepposax show that 80 - 100% of grbs that emit prompt x - ray emission also show an x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "we use this fraction ( 100 % ) as our estimate of the third parameter .    to estimate the fourth parameter ( the ratio of the x - ray fluence emitted in the prompt phase to the fluence from the early afterglow ) we use predictions of the standard fireball model . the standard fireball model ( wijers , rees , & meszaros 1997 ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ; @xcite )",
    "predicts that in the afterglow phase , the x - ray flux decreases as a power law , as the grb - induced blast waves sweep up surrounding matter and decelerate .",
    "the index of this power law may change its value on time scales from minutes to hours .",
    "in this `` external shock '' model , both the tail of the prompt x - ray emission and the afterglow are produced by the blast wave ( wijers , rees , & meszaros 1997 ) .",
    "the external shock model predicts that the amplitude of x - ray prompt emission during the final part of the grb should be equal to the back - extrapolated flux from the afterglow .",
    "this back - extrapolation holds for most grbs that were observed by bepposax @xcite .",
    "however , because the afterglow measurements by bepposax start 6 - 8 hours after the grb , there is no direct measurement of the x - ray flux immediately after the grb .",
    "if the x - ray afterglow decays as a power law , its integral fluence can reach 50%-200% of the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "we have assembled from the literature decay indices for 15 grb , and have calculated indices for 10 more , based on the published estimates of prompt and afterglow fluxes .",
    "the decay indices @xmath9 fall in the range -1.0 to -1.9 , most commonly about @xmath71.3 , and the distribution of indices can be satisfactorily fit with a gaussian .    in fig.5 , we combine all four parameters discussed above to obtain a log n - log s distribution for x - ray emission from grbs .",
    "this estimate is based on the gamma - ray ( 50 - 300 kev ) log n - log s distribution for all batse grbs with duration @xmath33  s. the solid curve is based on our xdgrb distribution of @xmath2 , sampled by monte carlo methods . to the prompt x - ray fluences we add a contribution from the afterglow obtained by monte carlo sampling of the afterglow decay parameter @xmath9 and integrating the afterglow out to @xmath26 seconds .",

    "it is clear that the fraction of fast x - ray transients that can be attributed to classical gamma - ray bursts drops with decreasing fluence .",

    "the origin of such bursts might be low accretion rate neutron star binaries .",
    "we can get an idea of the rate of ` empty ' place bursts from bepposax@xcite . it observed the galactic center region for @xmath40  s and detected about @xmath71500 x - ray type i bursts from @xmath41=31 sources . at the same time it observed @xmath42=4",
    "x - ray type i bursts from 4 ` empty place ' x - ray bursters .",
    "if all these events were generated on low - accretion x - ray neutron stars ( with , say , x - ray luminosity less than several percent of the eddington limit ) , and their space distribution follows the space distribution of normal x - ray bursters , we can estimate the total number of bursts from ` empty place ' per year per sky as : @xmath43 events , where @xmath44  50 is the total number of known normal bursters .",
    "if their distribution is isotropic , the number of bursts from ` empty ' places would be at least an order of magnitude greater.this simplified estimate agrees well with the bepposax estimate @xcite .",
    "they found that the total number of such sources in our galaxy is between 30 and 4000 , while the recurrence time between the bursts is a half year ( for 30 sources ) and several tens of years ( for 4000 sources ) the fluence from such events would be comparable with outbursts from rs cvn binaries , yielding about 50 - 100 events per sky in the @xmath45 region .",

    "rs cvn binaries typically exhibit a peak flux @xmath710@xmath46 erg / s for a duration of 1 to 10  h. outbursts from nearby rs cvn systems would have a fluence that puts them in the middle part of our diagram .",
    "this is certainly true for the identifications proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our analysis of grb x - rays indicates that this contribution to the fxt log n - log s is most significant around 100 - 1000 crab@xmath47 .",
    "heise et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported that about 70% of all fxts detected with bepposax are grb - related , i.e. , either conventional grbs or xrfs . 1 our best estimate ( xdgrb )",
    "indicates that the grb contribution to fxts ( see @xmath2 distribution discussion ) peaks at 20 - 30% .",
    "however , taking into account the uncertainties of both studies , we consider these results as moderately consistent between themselves , and consistent with @xcite .",
    "we note that bepposax / wfc detected @xmath71.5@xmath310@xmath48 thermonuclear x - ray bursts from @xmath735 sources , but did not classify them as fxts because they had clear identifications .",
    "some of these bursts might have been identified as fxts by earlier experiments like ariel-5 .",
    "this would increase the total number of fxts and decrease the grb fraction .",
    "our estimate of grb - related fxts is also consistent with the rosat result @xcite at low fluences .",
    "we have shown ( see fig.7 ) that the contribution of classical batse grbs drops dramatically for lower fluences .",
    "other sources must dominate fxt statistics that region .",
    "@xcite found 6 of their 10 fxts to be flares from late type dme - dke stars , i.e. , m or k dwarfs with balmer lines in emission .",
    "@xcite also identified 3 of 10 heao-1 a1 fxts with flare stars .",

    "their spectra have temperature @xmath71  kev , and they should be well detected by rosat .",
    "indeed , @xcite found star - like counterparts for 132 out of 141 reported fxts .",
    "we therefore suggest that the least luminous and most numerous part of log n - log s distribution is formed by nearby flare stars .",
    "there is however a fraction of lower - fluence fxts that are not identified with star - like objects .",
    "while the contribution of classical grbs should be negligible in this region , other types of progenitors may play a more important role .",
    "one of them , gamma - ray quiet grbs might arise in several ways ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent bepposax results have shown that some grbs are faint in the standard 50 - 300  kev batse band but bright in x - rays @xcite . out of the 53 grb - like transients detected with the bepposax wfc ,",

    "@xcite found that 9 of such xrfs were also seen by batse and recorded as untriggered events at batse database . according to sazonov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) 10% of watch events had detectable emission in 8 - 20 kev energy channel but no significant emission in the hard channel .",
    "our analysis ( see fig.6 ) confirms that untriggered batse events contribute only modestly to the lower fluence part of log n - log s if they follow the same @xmath2 distribution as the triggered events .",
    "but grb - like outbursts with softer spectra might be more significant at lower fluences .",
    "other exotic progenitors may contribute also .",
    "schafer , king , & deliyannis 2000 , suggested that ordinary main sequence stars like our sun may exhibit rare powerful superflares with @xmath50 - @xmath51 ergs , some of them in x - rays .",
    "however , one can not quantify their contribution until one better understand the frequency of such superflares .",
    "extragalactic sources may also generate fxt phenomena .",
    "x - ray variability is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei . in the last decade",
    "it was found that bl lac objects ( blazars ) exhibit strong correlated variability in both x - ray and tev gamma - ray bands on short timescales of days to hours @xcite .",
    "the brightest of such events may be detected as fxts .",
    "previous searches for fxt progenitors demonstrated that we probably deal with a mix of close ( flare stars ) and extragalactic ( grb - related ) events .",
    "the sky distribution for both these populations is expected to be isotropic .",
    "this is consistent with the sky distribution of detected fxt ( fig.3 ) .",
    "however , the absense of reliable exposure maps for many observations and possible selection effects leave room for the existence among fxts of a non - isotropic population with the galactic disk or bulge distribution .",
    "the slope of the log n - log s distribution of such additional component is expected to be flatter than -1.5 for a variety of possible progenitors .",
    "the most natural candidates for an additional component of fxts are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . @xcite",
    "have analyzed bepposax data and found several x - ray type - i bursts from empty places , where no persistent emission was detected down to a several mcrab limit .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new class of low - luminosity bursters . @xcite",
    "have shown that all detected bursts from empty places are indeed the members of such class and follow lmxb space distribution .",
    "since lmxbs are concentrated in the galactic bulge ( see e.g. recent review by grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2002 ) , any associated extra fxts should be clustered around the galactic center . however , most early surveys had difficulty in detecting fxts from this part of the sky @xcite .",
    "their localization accuracy was poor ( typically several degrees ) , and any x - ray flash from a populated region of the sky would tend to be attributed to known x - ray sources .",
    "hence , the population of lmxb with low persistent flux and emitting rare bursts would need to be be quite numerous to have been clearly detected by those instruments .",
    "emelyanov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown that ttm observations of the galactic bulge put strong constraints on the number - frequency function of low - accreting x - ray bursters indicating that the number of low - luminosity x - ray bursters @xmath3 the burst frequency from a burster is small .",
    "if the fxts that are distributed as a bulge population are fewer than several percent of all fxts , they can not be found with the usual statistical tests ( e.g. , a k - s test would not identify a bulge fraction less than 3% of the total as significant ) .",
    "the deviation from uniformity in the fxt distribution would be further masked by the poor ability of previous studies to find fxts at low latitudes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the discussion of source confusion in ariel-5 survey ) .",
    "our two most reliably identified source populations , gamma - ray bursts and stellar flares , although isotropically distributed , might yield a log n - log s distribution with a slope significantly flatter than -3/2 ( as would be expected for a uniform distribution of standard candles ) . in the case of gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "the distribution is known to flatten due to cosmological effects .",
    "even more important than the cosmological flattening , the luminosity distribution of fxts from grbs is flattened by the broad distribution of @xmath52 .",
    "we demonstrate below that nearby flare stars would also produce a distribution flatter than -3/2 .",
    "exosat observed 22 late - type flare stars ( dme - dke ) in the vicinity of the sun ( 2 - 20 pc ) in the 1 - 10  kev energy region .",
    "they found that these stars generated x - ray flares with total energies from 10@xmath53 to 10@xmath54 ergs and @xmath55 ( pallavicini , tagliaferri , & stella 1990 ) , e.g. with a differential frequency - flare distribution fits a power law n(e)@xmath56 .",
    "a similar distribution function has been observed for the sun , with differential frequency - flare energy distribution index @xmath57 @xcite or 2.0 @xcite , and for optical flares on the m dwarf flare star ad leo ( pettersen , coleman & evans 1984 ) .",
    "the integral distribution of x - ray flares from flare stars is :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the differential distribution function of x - ray flares from flare stars , e is the flare energy , @xmath60 is the nearest flare star , and s = e/(4 @xmath61 ) is the measured fluence .",
    "this distribution holds for sources uniformly distributed through the space ( as is certainly within a radius of 100 pc ) , with a differential frequency- flare energy function described with power law @xmath62 .",
    "we derive :    @xmath63    substituting @xmath64 , where @xmath9 is the slope of the cumulative frequency - flare energy function , we get :    @xmath65    if the total flare energy dynamical range @xmath66 $ ] , is greater than the distance dynamical range @xmath67 $ ] , then for a range of detected fluences @xmath68 $ ] the slope of the detected cumulative number - fluence function @xmath69 will be the same as the slope of the integral frequency- flare energy function @xmath70    exosat data confirm that @xmath71 for at least @xmath72 ( pallavicini , tagliaferri , & stella 1990 ) .",

    "integrating over the full range of distances ( 2 - 100 pc ) and flare energies ( @xmath76-@xmath77 ) , we estimate that the integral fluence distribution @xmath69 from stellar flares has a slope that steepens slowly from @xmath78 to -3/2 with increasing fluence ( fig.8 ) .",
    "note that over 3 orders of magnitude in fluence , it is close to a power - law with slope @xmath79 .    the intrinsic distribution of flare energy drives the observed log n - log s fluence distribution for the stellar component of fxts .",

    "ariel-5 was able to detect flares with @xmath84 within 2 pc , and assuming the most energetic flares within 10 pc .",

    "the catalog of chromospherically active stars @xcite includes 3 stars closer than 10 pc , while pallavicini , tagliaferri & stella ( 1990 ) observed 12 flare stars within 10 pc . basing on these data we accept @xmath88 as a lower limit for fraction of dme - dke stars around the sun . in this case",
    "the heao-1 experiments were able to detect x - ray flares from @xmath26 flare stars . because the heao-1 experiments were sensitive to fainter events than ariel-5 , and",
    "because flare star fxts are generally fainter than rs cvn fxts , we expect that the ratio between late - type flare stars and rs cvns should increase as we move from the ariel-5 to the heao-1 fluence band .",
    "this is consistent with their proposed identifications : heao-1 identified 10 events with dme - dke stars , while ariel-5 reported only one such identification .    in summary , over a wide range of fluences ,",
    "the intrinsic distribution of flare energies dominates over the geometric term , so that the -3/2 power law expected for standard candles does not apply .",
    "the shallow slope of the fxt distribution is , therefore , obtained naturally even for uniformly distributed progenitors .",
    "we have produced a composite log n - log s relationship for fast x - ray transients , by combining data from several experiments .",
    "this relation spans 4 orders of magnitude , and is fit to a power law with a slope of @xmath0 .",
    "extrapolation of this slope to lower fluences is consistent with the sensitive rosat and einstein experiments .",
    "the sources of fast x - ray transients are undoubtedly heterogeneous .",
    "the @xmath1 -1 power law must come from the summation of contributions from several different progenitor classes .",
    "both grbs and flares stars will contribute components to this distribution that are flatter than the ` isotropic ' slope of @xmath89 .",
    "the exact shape of the global fluence - frequency relationship might deviate from this simple power law , even inside the range we measured .",
    "however , due to the small number of events that we analyzed , and resulting large uncertainty in the deduced rate , a more complicated luminosity function is not justified ( see for example detailed discussion at murdoch , crawford , & jauncey ( 1973 ) ) .",
    "we use archival measurements of the x - ray and gamma - ray fluences for 134 grb to estimate the distribution of the x - ray to gamma - ray ratio .",
    "this @xmath2 distribution shows the presence of highly significant tail of x - ray rich events . extrapolating from the batse grb catalog , we find that the fraction of fast x - ray transients attributable to classical gamma - ray bursts is a function of fluence , being greatest for high fluences and dropping dramatically at the faint end .",
    "the exact fraction of grb - associated fast x - ray transients is sensitive to our assumptions about the @xmath2 distribution , but our analysis certainly shows that most of fainter fxts are not counterparts of classical gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the fraction of fxts from non - grb sources , such as magnetic flares on nearby stars , is the highest for the faintest flashes .",
    "our understanding of the fast x - ray transient phenomenon is still poor .",
    "the situation is similar to that for gamma - ray bursts before batse .",
    "there have been many fxts detected , but by a variety of instruments each with specific restrictions .",
    "the data show convincingly that fxts are ubiquitous .",
    "but the number of events detected by each particular experiment is small , and their statistical analysis is complicated .",
    "we can identify some classes of progenitor sources , but we can determine the fractional contribution of these classes only roughly . there remains room for the discovery of new types of sources that produce fast x - ray transients , but we certainly can not yet confirm the existence of new classes like `` gamma - ray quiet grbs '' or `` superflares '' at normal stars .",
    "a large uniform dataset from a dedicated , sensitive wide - field x - ray experiment ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "differences in the sensitivity band and observational strategy significantly affect the @xmath2 ratio measured with different instruments .",
    "in our analysis we made use of all data we aware of to obtain the most instrument - independent estimate possible .",
    "we calculated the mean , median and variance of the measured distributions of @xmath2 for the ` batse ' and xdgrb samples ( table 1 ) we also fitted the distribution @xmath2 for the xdgrb and ` batse ' samples with a gaussian , and with a gaussian plus quadratic polynomial .",

    "the inset on fig.4 shows the best - fit curves for the gaussian plus quadratic polynomial fit to the both samples , to show qualitatively how they differ .    to understand",
    "the effect of triggering on the @xmath2 distribution , we consider the simplified case in which the x - ray / gamma - ray fluence ratio follows a log - normal distribution . in other words , if @xmath9 is defined as @xmath90 , @xmath9 is distributed as a gaussian .",

    "if the log n - log s distribution goes as @xmath94 , then the x - ray triggered distribution of @xmath9 , for the same population of events , will follow a gaussian distribution of the same width , but centered on @xmath95 .",

    "this selection effect may explain the fact that watch generally selects softer grbs than batse . while batse triggers in the 50 - 300 kev band , watch triggers in the 8 - 100 kev band .",
    "however , the nominal trigger range for ginga , at 50 - 400  kev is harder even than batse .",
    "the softer @xmath2 ratio obtained by ginga may be the result of a secondary selection done by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . while ginga observed about 120 grbs @xcite , only the grbs with good quality spectral data in both @xmath98- and x - ray detectors were selected for spectral analysis , possibly driving the selection of softer , x - ray bright , grbs .",
    "we can make a rough check of the selection effect by taking the power law @xmath99 from batse measurements , calculating the displacement @xmath100 , and comparing it with the displacement between the batse and the other , mostly x - ray triggered , @xmath2 distributions .",

    "the direction is as expected : triggering at softer energies moves the @xmath2 distribution to larger values .",
    "we have tested whether the difference between the ` batse ' and xdgrb distributions was caused by the effect of trigger - band selection on a single distribution of grbs , or if there existed an additional x - ray rich grb population not detected by batse . to do this",
    "we have fit the @xmath2 distribution of the batse grb sample to a log - normal distribution",
    ". a maximum - likelihood estimate of the fit parameters gives @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this result shows that except of the triggering band effect there is also an additional contribution of x - ray rich events for xdgrb case .",

    "<S> these two types of progenitors are distributed isotropically in the sky , however their individual luminosity distributions are both flatter than the -3/2 power law that applies to uniformly distributed standard candles . extrapolating from the batse catalog of grbs , we find that the fraction of x - ray flashes that can be the x - ray counterparts of gamma - ray bursts is a function of fluence </S>",
