    "several collaborations have reported the observation of the new baryon @xmath0 with positive strangeness and minimal quark contents @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an exotic state with narrow width @xmath9 and @xmath10 was first predicted in the chiral quark soliton model , where the @xmath0 is a member of the baryon antidecuplet @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the discovery has opened a new field of strong interactions and provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the low energy qcd .",
    "intense theoretical investigations have been motivated to clarify the quantum numbers and to understand the under - structures of the pentaquark state @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the zero of the third component of isospin @xmath12 and the absence of isospin partners suggest that the baryon @xmath0 is an isosinglet , while the spin and parity have not been experimentally determined yet and no consensus has ever been reached on the theoretical side .",
    "the extremely narrow width below @xmath13 puts forward a serious challenge to all theoretical models , in the conventional uncorrelated quark models the expected width is of the order of several hundred @xmath14 , since the strong decay @xmath15 is okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) super - allowed .    in this article",
    ", we take the point of view that the quantum numbers of the pentaquark state @xmath16 are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and study its decay width within the framework of the qcd sum rules approach @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the strong coupling constant of the pentaquark state @xmath0 @xmath20 in section ii ; in section iii , numerical results ; section iv is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the three - point correlation function @xcite , @xmath21 where the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the interpolating currents for the neutron , k meson and pentaquark state @xmath0 respectively , @xmath25 for the pentaquark state @xmath0 , we use the diquark - triquark type interpolating current which can give satisfactory mass and stable magnetic moment @xcite . the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be taken as both goldstone bosons and quark - antiquark bound states",
    ", we can use the partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) in constructing the interpolating currents , @xmath28 , @xmath29 if we take the @xmath30 as the interpolating current , more care has to be taken about the possible contaminations from the axial - vector mesons , furthermore , the calculation will be more tedious ( with @xmath28 ) .",
    "the matrix element of the pseudoscalar current between the vacuum and @xmath27 state can be taken as @xmath31 the values of the @xmath32 depend on the masses of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks which have uncertainties , our numerical results indicate small variations of those masses will not lead to large changes about the values of the coupling constant @xmath1 . for the neutron ,",
    "we take the ioffe current @xcite .",
    "the fierz re - ordering of the interpolating currents @xmath35 and @xmath22 can lead to the following sub - structures , @xmath36 a naive result of the fierz re - ordering may be the appearance of the reducible contributions with the sub - structure of @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) clusters in the two - point correlation function @xcite , @xmath39 however , in our calculations with the interpolating current @xmath35 in eq.(2 ) , no such factorable @xmath37 terms appear , so there are no reducible @xmath38 contributions to the correlation function @xmath40 .",
    "the re - ordering in the dirac spin space is always accompanied with the color re - arrangement , which involves the underlying dynamics . if we want to factorize out some @xmath38 contributions from the @xmath40 ( with the current @xmath35 in eq.(2 ) ) , tedious manipulations about the re - ordering in the color and dirac spin space must be done .",
    "there are no direct @xmath38 ( or @xmath37 ) components in the interpolating current @xmath35 , which can readily decay to the @xmath41 final state and result in large width .",
    "if the @xmath0 is really a pentaquark state not a @xmath38 molecule , as the @xmath0 lies above the @xmath41 threshold and no need for additional quark - antiquark pairs creation in decay , the decay must be ozi super - allowed and the width is supposed be large , say , about several hundred @xmath14 ; to produce the narrow width , some huge energy barriers are needed to stabilize the @xmath0 in case the kinematical interpretation can not work here .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath38 component in the fierz re - ordering maybe manifest the possibility ( not the probability ) of the evolution from the @xmath0 to the @xmath41 final state without net quark - antiquark pairs creation ( maybe the quark - antiquark pairs created and annihilated subsequently ) , which is significantly in contrast to the conventional baryons , however , we have no knowledge about the detailed process of the evolution .",
    "the @xmath0 may evolve to the @xmath38 final state , and the @xmath38 final state is not presented in the components of the initial pentaquark state @xmath0 , how to implement the evolution with small probability involves complex quark - gluon interactions , whether just re - arrangement in the color space , or creation and annihilation of quark - antiquark pairs . in additive constituent quark models , whether or not additional relative p wave is introduced to changed the ground states from negative parity to positivity parity , special configurations are needed to take into account the narrow decay width as results of small overlaps of the internal and external @xmath38 wave - functions @xcite , the kinematical interpretations based on the color - flavor - spin ( i.e. @xmath42 ) group theory resort to the possible small overlaps , how to realized the small overlaps needs complex re - ordering in the color - flavor - spin space , if there are really no energy barriers to prevent the re - arrangement . while in the cluster quark models , typically , the diquark - diquark - antiquark model @xcite and diquark - triquark model @xcite , extra barriers , for example , relative p waves , are introduced dynamically to prevent the ready decay .",
    "in fact , the re - ordering in the color and dirac spin space involves complex strong interactions , and we know little now about the dynamics which determine the under - structures of the exotic pentaquark states .",
    "the mismatches between the color - flavor - spin states in the initial pentaquark and final baryon - meson color singlet can result in suppression of the decay naturally @xcite . due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the goldstone nature of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath43 , the quarks may have direct interactions with the pseudoscalar mesons , which lead to the success of some chiral quark models .",
    "the dominating interactions which determine the exotic pentaquark states be color - spin type @xmath44 or flavor - spin type @xmath45 are still in hot debates @xcite , the naive fierz re - ordering can lead to direct @xmath38 component in the @xmath0 will not work here .",
    "if there are really some @xmath38 components in the interpolating current @xmath46 , they should be factorized out , the remainder can not have the correct quantum numbers to interpolate the @xmath0 . in the qcd sum rules",
    ", we construct the interpolating currents with the same quantum number as the corresponding mesons and baryons , that is enough ; the knowledge about the structures of the hadrons can be of much help in the constructing .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the narrow decay width is attributed to the minor breaking of chirality conservation , the color re - arrangement due to the hard gluon - exchange can result in strong suppression of the decay , @xmath47 . in the article , we take quantitative analysis of the decay width within the framework of the qcd sum rules approach .",
    "the diquark - triquark type interpolating current @xmath48 is more likely related to a negative parity pentaquark state , in this work , we make assumption that the parity of the @xmath0 to be negative and study the decay width with the following lagrangian density , @xmath49 according to the basic assumption of current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite , we insert a complete series of intermediate states satisfying the unitarity principle with the same quantum numbers as the interpolating currents @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath50 into the correlation function in eq.(1 ) to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the double - pole and single - pole terms of the lowest ground states , we get the following result @xcite , @xmath51+\\cdots \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\left \\{\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } q_{\\mu}p_{\\nu } \\,\\ , + \\cdots\\right\\}+\\cdots\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left\\ { \\frac { g_{\\theta nk } \\lambda_{\\theta}\\lambda_{n}\\lambda_{k } } { m_{\\theta}^2- p'^2}\\int_0^{\\infty}ds \\int_0^{\\infty}dt \\frac{\\delta(s - m_{n}^2)\\delta(t - m_{k}^2 ) } { ( s- p^2)(t- q^2 ) } + \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",

    "the residues of the single - pole terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 have complex dependence on the transitions between the ground states and high resonances ( or continuum states ) .",
    "we have no knowledge about the transitions , even the existence of the @xmath0 is not firmly established .",
    "however , the contributions from the pole - continuum transitions are not exponentially suppressed compared with the double - pole terms , even after double borel transform , furthermore , the contributions can be as large as or larger than the double - pole terms and must be explicitly included in the sum rules .",
    "we only have the fact that the @xmath0 lies a little above the @xmath41 threshold , the contributions from the @xmath0 can be factorized out , so the spectral densities @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be parameterized as @xmath62 the two unknown functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 have complex dependence on the transitions between the ground states and high resonances ( or continuum states ) . from the eqs.(10 - 14 ) , we can obtain @xmath65+\\cdots \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\left \\{\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } q_{\\mu}p_{\\nu } \\,\\ , + \\cdots\\right\\}+\\cdots\\ , , \\\\ & = & \\left\\ { \\frac { g_{\\theta nk } \\lambda_{\\theta}\\lambda_{n}\\lambda_{k } } { m_{\\theta}^2- p'^2 } \\frac{1}{(m_{n}^2- p^2)(m_{k}^2- q^2 ) } + \\frac { 1 } { m_{\\theta}^2-p'^2}\\left[\\frac{cc } { m_{n}^2-p^2}+ \\frac{dd } { m_{k}^2-q^2 } \\right]+\\cdots \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\left \\{\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } q_{\\mu}p_{\\nu } \\,\\ , + \\cdots\\right\\}+\\cdots\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduce two constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 for convenience , @xmath68 taking the @xmath66 and @xmath67 as some unknown constants has smeared the complex dependence on the energy and high resonance masses ( or continuum states ) , which will certainly impair the prediction power .",
    "we have no knowledge about the transitions between the pentaquark state @xmath0 and the excited states ( or high resonances , or continuum states ) , the @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be taken as free parameters , we choose the suitable values for the @xmath66 and @xmath67 to eliminate the contaminations from the single - pole terms to obtain the reliable sum rules .",

    "if the final numerical results are insensitive to the threshold parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and there really exists a platform with the variations of the borel parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the predictions make sense .",
