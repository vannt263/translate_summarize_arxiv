    "<S> time dynamics of isolated many - body quantum systems has long been an elusive subject . very recently , however , meaningful experimental studies of the problem have finally become possible @xcite , stimulating theoretical interest as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because in generic isolated systems , one expects @xcite nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization : a relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary , universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions , and predictable through the time - tested recipe of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not obvious what feature of many - body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible , in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , dynamical chaos itself can not occur in an isolated quantum system , where time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete @xcite . underscoring that new rules could apply in this case </S>",
    "<S> , some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an isolated generic quantum many - body system does in fact relax to a state well - described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates , as first proposed by j. m. deutsch @xcite and m. srednicki @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a striking consequence of this _ eigenstate thermalization _ scenario , confirmed below for our system , is that the knowledge of a _ single _ many - body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages  any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do , as they all give the same result .    </S>",
    "<S> if we pierce an inflated balloon inside a vacuum chamber , very soon we find the released air uniformly filling the enclosure and the air molecules attaining the maxwell velocity distribution whose width depends only on their total number and energy . </S>",
    "<S> different balloon shapes , placements , or piercing points all lead to the same spatial and velocity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> classical physics explains this _ thermodynamical universality _ as follows @xcite : almost all particle trajectories quickly begin looking alike , even if their initial points are very different , because nonlinear equations drive them to explore ergodically the constant - energy manifold , covering it uniformly with respect to precisely the microcanonical measure . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the system possesses further conserved quantities _ functionally independent _ from the hamiltonian and each other , then time evolution is confined to a highly restricted hypersurface of the energy manifold . hence , microcanonical predictions fail and the system does not thermalize .    on the other hand , in isolated quantum systems not only is dynamical chaos absent due to the linearity of time evolution and the discreteness of spectra @xcite , but it is also not clear under what conditions conserved quantities provide independent constraints on relaxation dynamics . to begin with , </S>",
    "<S> any operator commuting with a generic and thus nondegenerate hamiltonian is functionally dependent on it @xcite , implying that the conservation of energy is the only independent constrain . on the other hand , even when operators are functionally dependent , their expectation values  </S>",
    "<S> considered as functionals of states  generally are not : for example , two states may have the same mean energies but different mean square - energies . </S>",
    "<S> for nondegenerate hamiltonians a maximal set of constants of motion with functionally independent expectation values is as large as the dimension of the hilbert space ; examples include the projectors @xmath0 to the energy eigenstates @xcite and the integer powers of the hamiltonian @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current numerical and analytic evidence from integrable systems suggests that there exists a minimal set of independent constraints whose size is much smaller than the dimension of the hilbert space but may still be much greater than one . in our previous work @xcite ( with v. yurovsky ) we showed that an integrable isolated one - dimensional system of lattice hard - core bosons relaxes to an equilibrium characterized not by the usual but by a </S>",
    "<S> generalized _ gibbs ensemble . instead of just the energy , </S>",
    "<S> the gibbs exponent contained a linear combination of conserved quantities  the occupations of the eigenstates of the corresponding jordan - wigner fermions  whose number was still only a tiny fraction of the dimension of the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> yet this ensemble works , while the usual one does not , for a wide variety of initial conditions @xcite as well as for a fermionic system @xcite ; it also explains a recent experimental result , the absence of thermalization in the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while at least some constraints beyond the conservation of energy must be kept , it turns out one needs only a relatively limited number of additional conserved quantities with functionally independent expectation values ; adding still further ones is redundant .    since it is not clear which sets of conserved quantities  and some are always present  </S>",
    "<S> constrain relaxation and which do not , it becomes even more urgent to determine whether isolated generic quantum systems relax to the usual thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical attention to this question has in fact been increasing recently , because of the high levels of isolation @xcite and control @xcite possible in experiments with ultracold quantum gases </S>",
    "<S> . however , despite numerous studies of specific models there is not yet consensus on how or even if relaxation to the usual thermal values occurs for nonintegrable systems @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]e might agree . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]f , the values of @xmath43 for the most - occupied states in the diagonal ensemble ( the largest values of eigenstate occupation numbers @xmath45 ) are always smaller than the microcanonical prediction , and those of the least - occupied states , always larger . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the usual thermal predictions fail because the correlations between the values of @xmath43 and @xmath45 preclude unbiased sampling of the latter by the former . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations have their origin in the nontrivial integrals of motion that make the system integrable and that enter the _ generalized _ gibbs ensemble , which was introduced in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the thermalization mechanism outlined thus far explains why long - time averages converge to their thermal predictions . a striking aspect of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , however , is that the time fluctuations are so small that after relaxation the thermal prediction works well at every instant of time . looking at eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ timeevolution ] ) , one might think this is so because the contribution of the off - diagonal terms gets attenuated by temporal dephasing , which results from the generic incommensurability of the frequencies of the oscillating exponentials . </S>",
    "<S> however , this attenuation only scales as the root of the number of dephasing terms , and is exactly compensated by their larger number : if the number of eigenstates that have a significant overlap with the initial state is @xmath46 , then typical @xmath47 , and the sum over off - diagonal terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ timeevolution ] ) finally does not scale down with @xmath46 : @xmath48 hence , were the magnitude of the diagonal and off - diagonal terms comparable , their contributions would be comparable as well , and time fluctuations of the average would be of the order of the average . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the case and thus @xmath49 figure [ fig4]a confirms this inequality for the matrix elements of the momentum distribution in our system . we should mention that there is an _ a priori _ argument  admittedly in part dependent on certain hypotheses about chaos in quantum billiards  in support of this inequality for the case when the mean value of @xmath15 in an energy eigenstate is comparable to the quantum fluctuation of @xmath15 in that state @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> * temporal vs quantum fluctuations*. * a * , matrix elements of the observable of interest , @xmath50 , as a function of state indices ; the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are indexed in the order of diminishing overlap with the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the dominance of the diagonal matrix elements is apparent . * </S>",
    "<S> b * , the same time evolution as in fig . </S>",

[ fig1]b suggests . indeed , as we show in figure [ fig4]b , the fluctuations that one would actually measure would be dominated by the quantum fluctuations of the time - dependent state . </S>",
    "<S> the rather large size of the quantum fluctuations relative to the thermal mean value is of course particular to small systems ; however , the dominance of the quantum fluctuations over the temporal fluctuations of quantum expectation values is not and is actually expected for generic systems in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that , in contrast to the integrable case , the nonequilibrium dynamics of a generic isolated quantum system does lead to standard thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that this happens through the eigenstate thermalization mechanism , a scenario j. m. deutsch @xcite demonstrated for the case of an integrable quantum hamiltonian weakly perturbed by a single matrix taken from a random gaussian ensemble and m. srednicki @xcite compellingly defended for the case of rarefied semiclassical quantum billiards , and which both authors conjectured to be valid in general . </S>",
    "<S> our results , when combined with the others we mentioned @xcite , constitute strong evidence that eigenstate thermalization indeed generally underlies thermal relaxation in isolated quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to understand the existence of universal thermal time - asymptotic states , one should study operator expectation values in individual eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> this is a problem that is linear , time - independent , and conceptually far simpler than any arising in the research  currently dominating the field  on the nonlinear dynamics of semiclassical systems . among the fundamental open problems of statistical mechanics that could benefit from the linear time - independent perspective </S>",
    "<S> are the nature of irreversibility , the existence of a kam - like threshold @xcite in quantum systems , and the role of conserved quantities in the approach to equilibrium . finally , having a clear conceptual picture for the origins of thermalization may make it possible to engineer new , `` unthermalizable '' states of matter @xcite , with further applications in quantum information and precision measurement .    </S>",
