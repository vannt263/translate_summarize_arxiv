    "the correlation - driven transition from a paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator ( mott - hubbard transition @xcite ) is one of the most interesting problems in condensed - matter physics . as a prime example for a quantum - phase transition ,",
    "the mott - hubbard transition is important from the physical point of view but also for the development and test of general theoretical methods to treat correlated electron systems . the minimum model required to study",
    "the mott - hubbard transition is the single - band hubbard model . @xcite",
    "inherent to this model is the competition between the electrons kinetic energy which tends to delocalize the electrons and favors a metallic state and the on - site coulomb interaction which tends to localize the electrons to avoid double occupancies and thereby favors an insulating state at half filling .",
    "except for the one - dimensional case , @xcite however , exact results with regard to the nature of the transition and the critical interaction strength @xmath1 are not available  even for this highly simplified model system . a direct numerical solution using exact - diagonalization or quantum monte - carlo methods @xcite suffers from the difficulty to access the thermodynamic limit or the low - temperature , low - energy regimes .",
    "considerable progress has been made in recent years due to the development of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite which focuses on the opposite limit of infinite spatial dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite within the dmft the problem is simplified by mapping the original lattice model onto an impurity model the parameters of which must be determined by a self - consistency condition .",
    "different techniques to solve the effective impurity model have been employed to study the mott transition within the dmft , iterative perturbation theory , @xcite exact diagonalization , @xcite renormalization - group methods , @xcite and quantum monte - carlo .",
    "@xcite one of the most important characteristic of the transition is the value of the critical interaction strength @xmath1 at zero temperature .",
    "roughly , the different techniques to solve the mean - field equations predict @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the width of the free density of states .",
    "recently , a self - energy - functional approach ( sfa ) has been put forward .",
    "@xcite the sfa is a general variational approach to correlated lattice models where the grand potential @xmath5 is considered as a functional of the self - energy @xmath6 . as this functional",
    "is constructed from an infinite series of renormalized skeleton diagrams , it is not known in an explicit form and the variational principle @xmath7 = 0 $ ] can not be exploited _",
    "directly_. usually , one replaces the exact but unknown functional with an explicitly known but approximate one  this is essentially the standard diagrammatic approach @xcite which leads to weak - coupling approximations in the end .",
    "@xcite opposed to this weak - coupling perturbational approach , the functional dependence @xmath8 $ ] is not approximated at all in the sfa .",
    "the key observation is that the functional , though unknown explicitly , can be evaluated on a restricted domain of trial self - energies @xmath9 .",
    "the evaluation of the functional is exact , while the approximation is due to the fact that the self - energy in the variational principle is no longer considered as arbitrary . in this way , depending on the choice for the space @xmath9 , some well - known but also some novel approximations can be realized .",
    "here we are interested in the single - band hubbard model with hamiltonian @xmath10 . as argued in ref .",
    "a useful trial self - energy has to be constructed as the exact self - energy of a different model ( `` reference system '' ) with hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "the reference system can be chosen arbitrarily  it must , however , share the same interaction part with the original model @xmath10 .",
    "the variational parameters at one s disposal are therefore the one - particle parameters of the reference system @xmath12 .",
    "the trial self - energy is parameterized as @xmath13 , and the variational principle reads @xmath14 / \\partial { \\bm t } ' = 0 $ ] . to provide trial self - energies",
    "is the only purpose of the reference system @xmath11 . whenever one is able to compute @xmath6 for the reference system @xmath11 , an exact evaluation of @xmath15 $ ] is possible .",
    "choosing @xmath11 to be a system of decoupled sites , yields a hubbard - i - type approximation .",
    "an improved approximation is obtained when @xmath11 consists of decoupled clusters with a finite number of sites @xmath16 per cluster as has been considered in refs .  .",
    "this approach not only recovers the so - called cluster - perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite but also gives a variational improvement ( v - cpt ) which e.g.  allows to describe phases with spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "@xcite another possibility is to take @xmath17 , which implies the trial self - energy to be local , but to include a coupling to a number of @xmath18 additional uncorrelated ( `` bath '' ) sites . in this case",
    "the reference system consists of a decoupled set of single - impurity anderson models ( siam ) with @xmath19 sites each . as has been shown in ref .",
    ", this approach not only recovers the dmft ( namely in the limit @xmath20 ) but also provides a new variant of the exact - diagonalization approach , namely for any finite @xmath18 .",
    "as compared to previous dmft - exact - diagonalization approaches , @xcite the construction gives a thermodynamically consistent approximation even for small @xmath18 .",
    "more complicated reference systems may be taken for the construction of consistent approximations , for example a system of decoupled clusters of size @xmath21 where each site in the cluster is coupled to @xmath18 additional bath sites .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the limit @xmath20 the cellular dmft ( c - dmft ) is obtained , @xcite while approximations with finite @xmath18 represent cluster approximations which `` interpolate '' between the cpt ( @xmath22 ) and the c - dmft ( @xmath23 ) .    in the present paper",

    ", one can directly work in the thermodynamic limit and describe phase transitions while the actual numerical treatment has to be done a system of finite size only . in the context of an embedding technique we have to distinguish between the original model of infinite size @xmath10 and an ( e.g.  spatially ) truncated _ reference system _ @xmath11 .",
    "the reference system must not necessarily be finite but it may consist of an infinite number of decoupled subsystems with a finite number of degrees of freedom each . in any case , @xmath11 must be exactly solvable .",
    "if one is interested not only in the equilibrium thermodynamics but also in the elementary one - particle excitations , an embedding technique should focus on a dynamical quantity , such as the frequency - dependent self - energy @xmath6 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath6 then allows to derive a thermodynamic potential @xmath5 as well as different static and dynamic quantities via general relations .",

    "more important , however , the conceptual improvement gained is substantial : while the mapping procedure on the two - site model , though physically motivated , is done in an ad - hoc way in the l - dmft , the two - site dia is derivable from a thermodynamical potential and can be characterized as an optimal two - site approach in fact .",
    "the fact that a reasonable mean - field description of the mott transition is possible even for the simple two - site dia , motivates further sfa studies of the transition with improved approximations in the future ( e.g.  using finite clusters , @xmath293 , and small @xmath18 ) . in case of larger and more complex reference systems , however , it becomes more and more important to have a numerically efficient and accurate method for the evaluation of the self - energy functional at hand .",
    "the detailed analysis of the different contributions to the functional has been another major intention of the present study . using the causality properties of the green function , it has been shown that the important @xmath294 term can be written as the grand potential of a system of non - interacting quasi - particles with unit weight ( apart from a correction term that cancels out in the functional eventually ) . while this result is also interesting by itself , it is very well suited for an efficient numerical implementation .",
