    "the hard - sphere chain fluid has been widely studied in recent years as a model for polymeric and related liquids .",
    "various theories have been applied to determine the thermodynamic properties of the model fluid , such as thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt)@xcite , generalized flory dimer theory ( gfd)@xcite , scaled particle theory ( spt)@xcite and various integral - equation theories@xcite . despite these studies ,",
    "several limitations still characterize most theories for the hard - sphere chain fluid , including the independence of intramolecular structure on the surrounding medium in homogeneous fluids@xcite , the inability to account for liquid - crystalline ordering@xcite and a general difficulty in formulating practical extensions of these theories to non - uniform systems .",
    "several density - functional approaches@xcite to the latter problem have been examined , but these have not overcome the other limitations mentioned above .    in this article",
    ", we investigate a systematic and straightforward density - functional method to begin resolving these limitations .",
    "we focus on a rather specific problem , namely to characterize the nematic - isotropic ( n - i ) phase transition in a fluid composed of _ rigid _ linear fused hard - sphere ( lfhs ) chain molecules .",
    "several related works have examined this topic recently@xcite .",
    "mehta and honnell@xcite applied gfd theory to the lfhs fluid , but were restricted to examining the isotropic phase .",
    "this is also true of the integral - equation and spt approaches studied in ref.@xcite , although some information about the n - i transition could be deduced from stability analysis of the isotropic phase .",
    "refs.@xcite studied the n - i transition in linear tangent hard - sphere ( lths ) chain fluids , using a density - functional approach based on the decoupling approximation introduced by parsons@xcite and lee@xcite for hard ellipsoids and hard spherocylinders .",
    "this approximation consists of a rescaling of the virial series originally used by onsager@xcite to account for the thermodynamic properties of a rigid - rod fluid .",
    "( ref.@xcite also describes an extension of the method to a fluid of semi - flexible chains . )",
    "the formulation discussed here is very similar to that of refs.@xcite , but utilizes a concept closely related to that of the tpt and gfd theories , namely that the thermodynamic properties of the full chain fluid can be described by a judicious combination of those characterizing `` reference '' fluids composed of smaller sub - units , in particular monomers and dimers .",
    "both formally and intuitively , this picture is well suited to describing fluids of _ flexible _ chain molecules@xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of the present work , focusing on rigid rods , is that the excluded volume ( and hence the second virial coefficient ) for a pair of lfhs molecules in an arbitrary orientation can be written _",
    "exactly _ as a linear combination of that for a pair of diatomic hard - sphere molecules and a pair of hard - sphere monomers .",
    "this property is based on a recent analysis of the orientation - dependent excluded volume for lths chains by williamson and jackson@xcite .",
    "here it is shown that the results of ref.@xcite can be extended straightforwardly to linear _ fused _ hard - sphere chains of arbitrary intramolecular bondlength .    in the present article ,",
    "the decoupling approximation is utilized in two stages . in the first stage",
    ", it is assumed that all higher - order virial coefficients scale ( in terms of monomer and diatomic contributions ) in the same way as the second virial coefficient . in the case of an isotropic fluid phase ,",
    "the resulting approximation for thermodynamic properties is similar to that of gfd theory , but differs from the latter in reproducing the exact second virial coefficient . in the second stage ,",
    "the excess free energy of the reference dimer fluid is rescaled in terms of the free energy of the isotropic phase of this fluid .",
    "this rescaling incorporates the exact weighted angle - average of the pair excluded volume , as in the theories of refs.@xcite , and thus is able to account for nematic ordering , in contrast to the original gfd theory .",
    "the theory is presented in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "although the focus of this paper is on uniform phases of a rigid molecular fluid , section [ sec : gen ] begins with the more general case of a non - uniform fluid and extensions of the theory to semi - flexible molecules are indicated briefly . in sections",
    "[ sec : ev ] and [ sec : fe ] , the theory is specialized to uniform phases of lfhs chains .",
    "calculations and results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , including comparisons with available monte carlo data for the n - i transition of both lths and lfhs chains .",
    "it is found that the present theory overestimates the reduced pressure when compared with both simulations and previous theories .",
    "however , the present results for coexistence densities and the nematic order parameter at the transition are in excellent agreement with simulations and are more accurate than those predicted by other recent theories@xcite .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] contains a summary and some conclusions .",
    "here we consider a one - component fluid containing on average @xmath0 molecules , each molecule ( or `` @xmath1-mer '' ) consisting of a rigid linear chain of @xmath1 atomic sites .",
    "the configuration of any such molecule labelled @xmath2 is specified by the position @xmath3 of some arbitrarily chosen `` center '' of the molecule and by the orientational euler angles @xmath4 of the molecular chain axis relative to some space - fixed frame .",
    "we assume that the total intermolecular potential energy for @xmath0 molecules is pairwise additive , and denote the pair potential between molecules @xmath2 and @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "the probability density for finding any molecule in a configuration @xmath7 is denoted @xmath8 , which is normalized such that @xmath9 the integration over molecular position is constrained to occur within the system volume @xmath10 . in density - functional theory , the helmholtz free energy @xmath11 of the fluid is expressed as a functional of @xmath12 . a formally exact , generalized virial expansion of @xmath11 in powers of @xmath12 can be obtained by straightforward adaptation of that for monatomic fluids @xcite , and is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is temperature , @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the thermal de broglie `` volume '' of a molecule , and @xmath18 is any external potential field acting on the fluid .",
    "@xmath19 is the excess ( over an ideal gas ) helmholtz free energy of the system , and is expressed by the virial series @xmath20 the generalized virial coefficients @xmath21 have a standard diagrammatic representation in terms of irreducible cluster integrals , where the vertices of the diagrams represent the product of functions @xmath22 and the bonds denote the mayer function @xmath23 for simplicity , the label @xmath24 is used to denote @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 etc .",
    "the preceding equations can be formally generalized to fluids of semi - flexible molecules on interpreting the symbol @xmath24 to include all internal coordinates of molecule @xmath2 and replacing @xmath27 by the full one - body potential incorporating internal bonding and flexibility constraints @xcite . in the usual approach of density - functional theory ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath28 in the preceding expressions for @xmath11 is considered to be an arbitrary function of the molecular configuration @xmath24 , while the equilibrium form of that distribution function is obtained by functional minimization of the corresponding grand canonical potential @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the chemical potential .    in the standard application of the decoupling approximation for the case of _ uniform _",
    "fluids@xcite , the @xmath31nd virial coefficient is treated exactly while the @xmath32th - order virial coefficient is approximated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the virial coefficient of an appropriate reference fluid . in previous works , the reference fluid has been chosen to be either a hard - sphere fluid @xcite or the _ isotropic _ phase of the actual system being considered @xcite . in either case , resummation of the virial series ( [ eq:3 ] ) then gives @xmath35 ( a generalization of this procedure for a non - uniform fluid of hard spherocylinders is described in ref.@xcite . )",
    "the gfd and tpt theories for fluids of chain molecules are based on a different choice of reference system , involving the decomposition of each molecule into its constituent monomers and constituent dimers .",
    "although originally derived using quite different arguments , we can obtain the gfd theory using the present framework .",
    "first , at the level of the @xmath31nd virial coefficient , we postulate that @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are appropriate mixing parameters . here",
    ", @xmath40 is the generalized @xmath31nd virial coefficient characterizing the fluid which results on decomposing each chain molecule into its constituent monomers , while @xmath41 is the analogous quantity for the reference fluid of constituent dimers .",
    "formally , the latter decomposition assumes that the number of monomers per chain @xmath1 is even .",
    "however , we anticipate ( as suggested by previous work on gfd and related theories @xcite ) that both the monomer and dimer reference fluids should be characterized by suitable _",
    "effective _ values of the number of monomers @xmath42 and number of dimers @xmath43 , respectively . in accordance with the decoupling approximation , we assume that the mixing parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be chosen so that ( [ eq:8 ] ) generates the exact @xmath36 . this condition will be examined in subsection [ sec : ev ] . if it is assumed that all higher - order virial coefficients @xmath21 scale in a similar manner , @xmath46 @xmath47 then resummation of the series in ( [ eq:3 ] ) gives @xmath48 + a_{n}^{(d ) } \\delta   f^{(d)}[\\rho_{d}({\\bf r}\\omega ) ] .\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the probability densities for monomers and dimers , respectively , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the corresponding excess free energies , which in general are functionals of the densities . for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath1-mer contains only one type of monomer and dimer sub - unit ; the generalization to heteronuclear molecules is straightforward .",
    "the standard gfd theory for isotropic , homonuclear hard - sphere chain fluids , as investigated previously in refs.@xcite , can be formulated from the theory presented here . in particular ,",
    "gfd theory is obtained from eqs.([eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:10 ] ) , and a _ modified _ form of the condition ( [ eq:8 ] ) . in order to determine the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 in this case , ( [ eq:8 ] ) is applied with @xmath53 and @xmath54 _ approximated _ by the cross second virial coefficient between a monomer and the full @xmath1-mer and between a monomer and a dimer , respectively .",
    "an additional condition is then required to fix @xmath38 and @xmath39 uniquely , which turns out to be @xmath55 this is consistent with the `` initial conditions '' that @xmath56 , @xmath57 when @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 when @xmath61 . with these approximations ,",
    "one obtains @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the quantity defined in eq.(14 ) of honnell and hall@xcite .    in the next subsection",
    ", we shall specialize ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) to the case of a uniform fluid of rigid homonuclear hard - sphere chains .",
    "it will be shown that ( [ eq:8 ] ) can be satisfied _ exactly _ when using the exact values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 and with a unique choice for the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 depending only on the geometric properties of the molecules .",
    "here we consider that the full chain molecule is a rigid rod composed of @xmath1 identical hard - sphere atoms , each of diameter @xmath64 , with adjacent atoms separated by bondlength @xmath65 . in a _ uniform _ but",
    "possibly orientationally ordered fluid , the @xmath1-mer probability density takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the molecular number density and @xmath68 is a normalized angular distribution function .",
    "the generalized second virial coefficient @xmath36 defined by ( [ eq:5a ] ) becomes @xmath69 for hard - body interactions , this reduces to @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the excluded volume between two rigid @xmath1-mers , which depends on the relative angle @xmath72 between their axes .",
    "analogous expressions hold for the monomer and dimer virial coefficients , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in particular , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number density of dimers and @xmath75 is the corresponding excluded volume .",
    "note that for rigid linear rods , the same angular distribution function , @xmath68 , characterizes the full rod and any diatomic subunit of the rod .",
    "for the monomer fluid , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the monomer number density .",
    "the monomer excluded volume @xmath78 , of course , has no angular dependence .",
    "requiring that ( [ eq:8 ] ) holds exactly then implies the following relation between the excluded volumes , _ independent of the angular distribution function and number densities _ , @xmath79    using analytic results for the angle - dependent excluded volume between rigid @xmath1-mers first derived by williamson and jackson ( wj)@xcite , we shall show that ( [ eq:18 ] ) is indeed satisfied exactly for appropriate values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the work of wj was restricted to linear tangent hard - sphere chains , but it is straightforward to generalize their analysis to lfhs chains of arbitrary bondlength @xmath65 .",
    "details are contained in the appendix .",
    "the basic result is ( see ( [ eq : a3 ] ) ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the excluded volume for two parallel @xmath1-mers @xmath82 , given by ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , and @xmath83 is the contribution from the so - called `` central region '' ( in the terminology of wj ) of the overlap volume between two diatomic molecules .",
    "this is given by ( a15 ) in the appendix .",
    "note that , contrary to the remarks by wj , the latter involves `` compact and tractable '' analytic formulae .    before comparing ( [ eq:18 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) , one rewriting of the former is required .",
    "as already noted , the `` reference '' monomer and dimer fluids may be characterized by `` effective '' values of the numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , it may be allowed that the diameters and bondlengths of the reference particles differ from those of the original chain molecule .",
    "this feature arises in gfd theory @xcite due to the assumption that the volume fractions of the reference fluids should equal that of the original @xmath1-mer fluid , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the @xmath1-mer molecular volume .",
    "equivalently , this requires that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the molecular volumes of the reference monomers and dimers , respectively@xcite .",
    "the equality of the volume fractions of the reference fluids and @xmath1-mer fluid arises automatically in the case of tangent hard - sphere chains with @xmath91 , and no adjustment of the number and sizes of reference particles is needed .",
    "this is no longer true when a chain of fused hard spheres @xmath92 is decomposed into reference monomers and dimers@xcite .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the diameter of a reference monomer is denoted @xmath93 , the diameter of a monomer in a reference dimer is denoted @xmath94 , while the bondlength of the reference dimer is denoted @xmath95 .",
    "it is these lengths which characterize the excluded volumes @xmath78 and @xmath96 in ( [ eq:18 ] ) , whereas all terms in ( [ eq:19 ] ) for @xmath71 are characterized by the diameter @xmath64 and bondlength @xmath65 of the original @xmath1-mer .",
    "hence , it is appropriate to rewrite ( [ eq:18 ] ) in terms of the original molecular dimensions . on dimensional grounds , as confirmed by the equations in the appendix , the dimer excluded volume scales as @xmath97 where the dependence of @xmath75 on molecular lengths has been indicated .",
    "then ( [ eq:18 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath98 where @xmath78 and @xmath96 now refer to the _ original _ monomer and dimer inside the @xmath1-mer .",
    "( note @xmath99 . )",
    "comparing ( [ eq:19 ] ) and ( [ eq:21 ] ) now gives @xmath100 and @xmath101}{n_m v_e^{(1 ) } } \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq:22b }   & = & \\left(\\frac{d}{d_m}\\right)^3 \\frac{(n-2)}{n_m }     [ 2(n - 1)\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{l}{d}\\right ) + \\frac{1}{16}\\left(\\frac{l}{d}\\right)^3\\right )    + ( 2 - 3n ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line in ( [ eq:22b ] ) follows from ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "equations ( [ eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) have been written in terms of the combined parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 because , as will be seen in the next subsection , only these combinations appear in the expressions for thermodynamic functions . as stated at the end of the previous subsection , @xmath39 and @xmath38 are seen to depend only on the geometric properties of the molecules .",
    "of several prescriptions introduced in gfd theory @xcite to adjust the effective parameter values , our reliance on the scaling relation ( [ eq:20 ] ) restricts us to those which conserve the reduced bondlength , @xmath104 .",
    "these are the approaches analogous to the a , c , and ac versions of gfd theory @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that these methods all yield _ identical _ thermodynamic results in the present theory .",
    "this follows from the fact that , according to ( [ eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) , @xmath102 and @xmath103 depend on the diameters and numbers ( for fixed @xmath105 ) only through the combinations @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , the values of which are uniquely determined by the condition of equal volume fractions@xcite .",
    "let us briefly compare the present expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath38 in ( [ eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) with those given by gfd theory for lfhs chains .",
    "the latter were derived recently by mehta and honnell @xcite using gfd - a theory , which corresponds to taking @xmath108 while the effective numbers of monomers @xmath84 and dimers @xmath85 are adjusted to conserve volume fraction . for this case ,",
    "mehta and honnell @xcite showed that the function @xmath63 in ( [ eq:12 ] ) has the value @xmath109 and thus ( [ eq:12 ] ) reduces to @xmath110 independent of bondlength . for simplicity ,",
    "we compare ( [ eq:23 ] ) with ( [ eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) in the case of tangent spheres , for which @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "eqs.([eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) then give @xmath113 where we indicate the leading asymptotic dependence for large @xmath1 . in this limit , the present parameters @xmath114 and @xmath103 have nearly double the magnitude of those given by gfd theory .",
    "this leads , via @xmath39 , to a significantly stronger angular dependence of the excluded volume ( [ eq:18 ] ) than would be predicted by gfd theory .",
    "one notes that @xmath38 is negative for @xmath115 according to both ( [ eq:23 ] ) and ( [ eq:24 ] ) , and thus the non - ideal thermodynamic behavior of the fluid can be considered to involve a _ subtraction _ of the behavior of the monomer fluid from that of the dimer fluid .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the approximate factor of two difference between gfd and the present theory for the separate parameters @xmath116 and @xmath103 largely cancels out for the second virial coefficient in an isotropic phase , consistent with the findings of mehta and honnell @xcite . by construction ,",

    "in addition , the values of the coexistence densities obtained from these theories are in poor agreement with simulation , while the present theory provides a quantitatively accurate description of these densities .      simulations of lfhs chains have been performed by whittle and masters@xcite for the cases of @xmath182-mers with a reduced bondlength of @xmath183 and @xmath167-mers with @xmath183 and @xmath184",

    "the gfd theory and the modified tpt are unable to treat ordering , and therefore are inappropriate at densities above the isotropic - nematic transition which was evidenced in the simulation of the @xmath167-mer system with @xmath185 . in fig .  6 , we perform an analogous study of the three fluids , comparing the previous results@xcite with those of the present theory .",

    "the present theory and the modified tpt both overestimate the values of the reduced pressure , while the gfd theory appears to predict the reduced pressure to a fair degree of accuracy .",

    "6(b ) exhibit no such transition , and we are unaware of any other simulations which have been done for this system . it should be noted that the monomeric reference fluid does not exist as a stable fluid above @xmath186@xcite and as such the theory is probably invalid at these high densities .    figure  6(c ) considers the @xmath167-mer fluid with @xmath185 , a system which clearly exhibits nematic ordering . at first glance",
    "it appears that the present theory , while succeeding in predicting a stable nematic branch , predicts that it occurs at volume fractions much greater than the simulations indicate .",
    "however , it should be noted that although whittle and masters@xcite report a nematic branching at @xmath187 , the order parameter was not found to be stable until much higher volume fractions , @xmath188 .",
    "the predictions of the present theory for transition properties are compared with the simulation results in table  1 .",
    "once again , we see that there is good agreement for the value of the nematic order parameter @xmath151 .",
    "it is of interest to examine the present theory in the `` spherocylinder '' limit , which is obtained in the limits @xmath189 , @xmath190 , such that @xmath191 remains finite . as discussed in the appendix , our analytical result for the lfhs excluded volume reduces ( as should be expected ) to that for hard spherocylinders of cylinder length @xmath192 in this limit .",
    "figure  7 shows the nematic and isotropic coexistence volume fractions for lfhs @xmath1-mers as a function of @xmath1 , for a fixed value of @xmath193 , in comparison with the values for spherocylinders obtained from the lee theory@xcite and from monte carlo calculations ( using the gibbs - duhem integration procedure ) by bolhuis and frenkel@xcite .",
    "one sees that both the individual volume fractions and their differences increase slowly with @xmath1 , and approach the asymptotic spherocylinder values reasonably well , although underestimating the coexistence width in the limit . in more detail , it can be shown that the present theory in the spherocylinder limit yields exactly the same angular distribution function @xmath68 , at a given volume fraction @xmath123 , as in the lee theory@xcite .",
    "however , the free energy and pressure are actually predicted to _",
    "diverge _ in this limit , which accounts for the narrower coexistence width found in fig .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced two key modifications into the generalized flory - dimer ( gfd ) theory to describe nematic behavior in hard - sphere chain fluids of arbitrary intramolecular bondlength .",
    "the first modification is the inclusion of the exact excluded volume and second virial coefficient for lfhs chain molecules , based on generalizing the earlier calculation of williamson and jackson@xcite .",
    "this procedure results in mixing parameters for the reference monomer and dimer fluids which are dependent only on the geometric properties of the molecules ( see ( [ eq:22a ] ) and ( [ eq:22b ] ) ) .",
    "a related feature is that the ansatz of equal volume fractions _",
    "uniquely _ determines the values of the relevant combinations of the effective reference parameters @xmath194 and @xmath93 , in contrast to previous studies based on gfd and related theories@xcite .",
    "the second modification of gfd theory , in order to account for the possibility of nematic ordering in the system , is the weighting of the excess dimer free energy by the ratio between the second virial coefficients of the nematic and isotropic dimer fluids ( see ( [ eq:28a ] ) and ( [ eq:28b ] ) ) .",
    "this ansatz , suggested by decoupling theory , is dependent on the angular distribution function , which is determined self - consistently .",
    "the present theory is found to be in excellent agreement with simulations of lths fluids in determining coexistence densities and the nematic order parameter as a function of density . as is seen clearly in table  1 and fig .  5",
    ", the transition densities for the @xmath169-mer , @xmath167-mer and @xmath168-mer fluids predicted by the theory fall within the coexistence range found in simulations .",
    "in particular , the @xmath169-mer system studied by williamson and jackson@xcite shows much better agreement with the present theory than with the vega and lago@xcite and the parsons@xcite theories for the coexistence densities as well as the nematic order parameter at the transition .",
    "the present theory is able to account for stable nematic branches in lfhs chains of sufficient length , for which theoretical work has been lacking up to now .",
    "the @xmath167-mer with @xmath185 simulated by whittle and masters@xcite yielded transitions at lower densities than predicted by the present theory , although the simulated nematic branch did not become stable until densities similar to those predicted in our work .",
    "in addition , transitions between the isotropic and nematic phases are predicted by the present theory for several systems which have yet to be simulated ( see figs .  5 and 7 ) .",
    "the agreement between the present theory and simulations is promising and it is hoped that further work will be encouraged .    for all systems studied ,",
    "the present theory yields values for the pressure which exceed those given by available simulation data as well as previous theories .",
    "this discrepancy is not accounted for within this paper , and further work needs to be done to resolve the problem . it was noted in section [ sec : lfhs ] that the free energy and pressure given by the present theory actually diverge in the spherocylinder limit @xmath195 , @xmath196 , with @xmath197 finite .",
    "this divergence can be traced to the incorrect limiting behavior of the tildesley - streett ( ts)@xcite dimer equation of state for small reduced bondlength @xmath133 .",
    "the ts equation of state predicts that the reduced isotropic second virial coefficient ( as well as higher virial coefficients ) varies linearly with @xmath133 ( see ( [ eq:27b ] ) ) , in contrast with the correct leading - order variation proportional to @xmath198 ( see ( [ eq : a17 ] ) ) .",
    "however , use of other dimer equations of state which do have the correct dependence for @xmath199 , such as the `` improved scale particle theory '' of boublik and nezbeda@xcite , produces negligible differences from most of the results described in this paper , apart from those shown in fig .  7 for @xmath200 .    despite the mixed agreement of our results with those of available simulations",
    ", we believe that the approach described here has advantages over other current density functional theories of chain fluids@xcite , particularly for considering extensions of the theory to non - uniform fluids and ones containing semi - flexible molecules . in section [ sec : gen ] , we briefly indicated these generalizations of the theory , which we are currently investigating in more detail .",
    "our approach retains the geometrically motivated spirit of the gfd and tpt theories in utilizing reference fluids composed of monomer and dimer subunits , whose properties can be readily determined .",
    "this contrasts with the form of the decoupling approximation used in refs.@xcite , requiring _",
    "@xmath201 priori _ information about the thermodynamics of the isotropic phase of the full system being considered , which may be either unavailable or computationally difficult to obtain in the more general cases .",
    "at the same time , the dimer reference fluid has the crucial property of involving orientational degrees of freedom .",
