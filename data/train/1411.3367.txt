    "second order leapfrog or splitting methods are a class of widely used time - symmetric , explicit and symplectic integration algorithms for hamiltonian systems .",
    "these characteristics make them a standard tool for very long integrations , as they preserve the phase space structure and first integrals of the system .",
    "being time - symmetric , second order leapfrog algorithms have an error expansion that only contains even powers of the timestep .",
    "this fact makes them convenient for use within extrapolation schemes , such as the gragg  bulirsch ",
    "stoer ( gbs ) method @xcite , which are often used when very high accuracy is required @xcite .",
    "the main problem with leapfrog methods is the fact that they can only be constructed for systems where the hamiltonian separates into two or more parts , where the flow of each part can be separately integrated @xcite .",
    "a solution to this problem for partitioned systems of the type @xmath0 was presented in @xcite . by means of auxiliary velocity",
    "coordinates , the equations of motion were transformed into a separable form and thus amenable for integration with a leapfrog method .",
    "the method , called auxiliary velocity algorithm ( ava ) , can also be used for nonconservative systems as well .",
    "in this paper we propose an improved extension of the ava method , applicable for hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian cases where all equations of motion depend on both coordinates and momenta in general .",
    "we first briefly introduce leapfrog integration methods , and outline their properties .",
    "next , we demonstrate how the phase space of general hamiltonian systems can be extended and a new hamiltonian constructed so that the equations of motion are brought into a separated form .",
    "we then construct symmetric leapfrog integrators for the equations .",
    "these include maps that mix the extended phase space , which we find to be a requirement for good long term behaviour .",
    "finally , we investigate how the extended phase space can be projected back to the original number of dimensions so that extra accuracy can be gained in the process .",
    "we then show how the same principle can be applied to nonconservative systems as well .",
    "we apply the obtained leapfrog methods to illustrative example cases : hamiltonian geodesic flow , and a forced van der pol oscillator .",
    "in many applications to classical physics , such as gravitational interaction of point masses , the hamiltonian function @xmath1 of the system can be separated into two parts @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the kinetic energy , and @xmath4 is the potential energy . in these cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian equations of motion read @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the equations for coordinates can then be directly integrated , if the momenta are kept constant , and vice versa .",
    "the solutions can be combined in a time - symmetric manner to obtain the two forms of the archetypal second order leapfrog , also known as the strmer  verlet method , or strang splitting @xcite :    @xmath7    and    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the timestep .",
    "equations and can also be written as @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the hamiltonian vector fields of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the phase space flow along the vector field @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the symplectic form given in local coordinates , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 identity matrix and @xmath25 is the exponential mapping from a lie algebra @xmath26 to the corresponding lie group . here the lie algebra is the algebra of smooth , real - valued functions on the phase space , with the lie product given by the poisson brackets @xmath27 .",
    "the group action ( written multiplicatively in equations and ) on the phase space manifold of the corresponding lie group is the phase space flow of the associated vector field .",
    "now , a reverse application of the baker  campbell  hausdorff ( bch ) formula on equation yields @xmath28 \\\\ & \\quad\\quad= \\exp(h{\\widehat{h } } ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where then @xmath29 and similarly for with @xmath30 .",
    "equations - are of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the flows of hamiltonian vector fields @xmath31 are symplectic transformations for smooth functions @xmath32 @xcite , and thus preserve the geometric structure of the phase space , and all first integrals .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are smooth , the leapfrog method has these properties as well .",
    "equation shows on the other hand that leapfrog integrators exactly solve a hamiltonian problem that is asymptotically related to the original one , with a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "another desirable property of the second order leapfrogs is ( relatively ) easy composition of the basic second order method to yield methods of higher order @xcite .",
    "if @xmath34 is the numerical flow of a time - symmetric second order leapfrog , then @xmath35 can be shown to be a method of higher order for certain choices of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 for time - symmetric methods such as the second order leapfrog @xcite .",
    "one particular example is the sixth order composition @xmath39 from @xcite ( composition ` s9odr6a ` in the paper ) , which we will use in section  [ sc:5.2 ] .",
    "the second order leapfrog is also useful when used within an extrapolation scheme , such as the gbs scheme @xcite .",
    "using an extrapolation scheme does in principle destroy the desirable properties of the leapfrog , since the substeps require a change in timestep which destroys symplecticity , and the final linear combination of the symplectic maps is also not symplectic in general . in practice , the increase in accuracy per computational work spent often offsets this . for a comprehensive review of splitting methods in contexts not limited to hamiltonian ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , see @xcite , for geometric integration methods in general , see @xcite , and for extrapolation and other conventional methods for general odes , see @xcite .",
    "in the general case , the hamiltonian @xmath40 does not separate into additive parts , and the approach of the previous section can not be used .",
    "we can partially circumvent this problem in the following manner .",
    "we first extend the phase space @xmath41 ( essentially @xmath42 , when always operating in local coordinates ) by joining it with another identical copy , giving an extended phase space @xmath43 . in local",
    "coordinates @xmath44 , the symplectic form @xmath45 on this phase space is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the symplectic form on @xmath41 and @xmath48 is the kronecker product .",
    "we then introduce a new hamiltonian @xmath49 on this extended phase space with @xmath50 where now @xmath51 , equal to the hamiltonian function of the original system .",
    "hamilton s equations for the two parts of this split hamiltonian are then    [ eq : h1 ] @xmath52    and    [ eq : h2 ]",
    "@xmath53    we see that the derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend only on @xmath56 and @xmath57 and vice versa , and the equations can be integrated to yield the actions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we can now apply the results from the previous section to find @xmath60 where @xmath12 , which gives the leapfrog algorithms    [ eq : lf212 ] @xmath61    and    [ eq : lf121 ] @xmath62    over one timestep @xmath63 .",
    "the leapfrog methods and then exactly solve the hamiltonian flows of the related hamiltonians @xmath64 if we now consider a hamiltonian initial value problem , with the initial values @xmath65 and set @xmath66 , @xmath67 , we see that the equations and give identical derivatives and identical evolution for both pairs @xmath68 and @xmath69 , equal to the flow of the original hamiltonian system @xmath70 .",
    "the numerical leapfrog solutions and then solve closely related hamiltonian problems given by and .",
    "we can write the problem in the form @xmath71 where the component vector fields @xmath72 are hamiltonian . we also define operators @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and similarly for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a translation along the vector field @xmath32 . from this",
    "we see that we can also construct split solutions like @xmath78 where the last equality defines a shorthand notation based on the symmetry of the operator .",
    "pairs @xmath79 and @xmath80 commute , so e.g. @xmath81 original and auxiliary variables are also interchangeable , since they initially have the same values . as such , the only unique symmetric second order leapfrog compositions are ( with the above shorthand )    [ eq : all_lfs ] @xmath82    up to a reordering of commuting operators , and switching @xmath83 .    from the leapfrogs ,",
    "the only one symplectic in the extended phase space is , as well as its conjugate method @xmath84 .",
    "it is _ not _ , however symplectic as a mapping @xmath85 within the original phase space if the final @xmath86 are obtained from @xmath87 by any pairwise choice .",
    "however , operating in the extended phase space and projecting only to obtain outputs , without altering the state in the extended phase space , leads to an algorithm that preserves the original hamiltonian with no secular growth in the error .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , since the algorithms have similarities with partitioned multistep methods , which can exhibit good long term behaviour despite a formal lack of symplecticity @xcite . by virtue of being leapfrogs , the algorithms are also explicit , time - symmetric , have error expansions that contain only even powers of the timestep and can be sequentially applied to form higher order methods .",
    "the idea behind equation can be generalised further .",
    "introducing yet another copy of the phase space with coordinates @xmath88 leads to a hamiltonian of the form @xmath89.\\ ] ] the hamiltonian gives three sets of separable equations of motion that can be integrated with a leapfrog method . as with the leapfrogs , only the leapfrogs obtained from sequential applications of the flows of the different hamiltonians in equation give a method symplectic in the extended phase space .",
    "again , no simple pairwise choice of the extended phase space variables leads to a method that is symplectic in the original phase space .    in general , using @xmath90 sets of variables in total , with a phase space @xmath91 , one can use a hamiltonian of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a cyclic permutation of the indexes of the momenta .",
    "the equations of motion of any @xmath95 can be integrated with a leapfrog , as is the case for their symmetric combination @xmath96 .",
    "however , we will not investigate this general case in the paper .      while equations and can be integrated with a leapfrog ,",
    "the fact that they are coupled only through the derivatives is a problem .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field of one solution at a point depends on the other and vice versa , but not on the solution itself .",
    "since the two numerical flows will not in general agree with each other or the exact flow , the derivative function for one numerical flow at one point will end up depending on a different point of the other solution , and both solutions may diverge with time .",
    "this problem is quickly confirmed by numerical experiments .    an seemingly straightforward solution for this problem would be to introduce feedback between the two solutions , in the form of _ mixing maps _",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "we now amend the leapfrogs to obtain , e.g. @xmath99 so that the resulting algorithm is still symmetric , since at the last step , @xmath100 can be subsumed into the projection map described below .",
    "if @xmath101 are symplectic , then the leapfrogs that are symplectic on the extended phase space , i.e. , retain this character .",
    "there is no need to restrict @xmath101 to strictly symplectic maps , however , since the extended phase space leapfrogs are not symplectic when restricted to the original phase space in any case . without this restriction ,",
    "potentially attractive candidates might stem from e.g. symmetries of the extended hamiltonian and its exact solution .",
    "for example , for , permutations of coordinates , @xmath102 , or momenta , @xmath103 , do not change the exact solution for given ( equal ) initial conditions . permuting both switches",
    "the component hamiltonians , but since they are equal , this has no effect for the exact solution .",
    "we will find that for the numerical method , the permutations can be beneficial .",
    "a related problem is how to project a vector in extended phase space back to the dimension of the original .",
    "this should be done in a manner that minimizes the error in the obtained coordinates , momenta and original hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , the final algorithm should be symplectic , or as close to symplectic as possible . to this end",
    ", we introduce a _ projection map _ @xmath104 . in principle",
    ", the projection map could be used in two different ways .",
    "the first is to obtain formal outputs at desired intervals , while the algorithm always runs in the extended phase space .",
    "the second is to use the projection map after each step , and then copy the projected values to create the extended set of variables for the next step .",
    "the final algorithm @xmath105 over @xmath106 steps would then be either of @xmath107 where @xmath108 is function composition , and @xmath109 is the cloning map @xmath110 .    it should be emphasized that in equation , the projection map is included only to obtain the formal output after @xmath106 steps , while the current state @xmath111 is preserved , and used to continue the integration .",
    "in contrast , the algorithm can evidently be considered as a mapping @xmath112 in the original phase space , and as such represents a conventional method such as a partitioned runge  kutta method , as seen in section  [ sc:3.2 ] .",
    "unfortunately , for hamiltonian problems , it leads to secular increase of the error in the original hamiltonian . in the hamiltonian case",
    ", it seems that operating in the extended phase space is necessary , and as such , is to be used .    to take a first stab at determining a suitable choice for @xmath101 and @xmath113",
    ", we turn to analyzing the error in the hamiltonian function and deviations from symplecticity .      we start the search of suitable candidates for @xmath101 and @xmath113 from symmetric linear maps of the form @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath98 , and all matrix elements are real .",
    "we then look for the coefficients that give the best results according to conservation of hamiltonian function or symplecticity .",
    "we can thus use , say , @xmath116 take two steps to make @xmath100 and @xmath113 independent , and expand @xmath117 in terms of @xmath63 , where @xmath118 , and look at the coefficients . in this example",
    "case , the zeroth order coefficient of reads @xmath119 with @xmath120 to make the cofficient identically zero , we need to have @xmath121 for all the maps @xmath101 and @xmath113 , which makes them linear interpolations between the original and auxiliary coordinates and momenta . with the substitutions , also the first order coefficient of becomes identically zero",
    "the same substitution zeroes the coefficients of up to and including the second order .",
    "the third order coefficient of becomes independent of the map matrix elements , and as such we will focus on the expansion of .",
    "the second order coefficient is @xmath122,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and the derivatives @xmath124 are @xmath125-linear operators @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and juxtaposition in implies contraction .",
    "from here , there are several choices available .",
    "we will consider some interesting combinations .",
    "choosing @xmath129 makes the second order term identically zero .",
    "taking @xmath130 and @xmath131 then makes also the third order term be identically zero , and as such apparently gives an additional order of accuracy compared to the standard leaprog .",
    "however , despite this , these choices lead to poor long term behaviour , which numerically is quickly apparent .",
    "if @xmath132 and @xmath133 , so that the momenta are permuted , then choosing @xmath134 will also identically zero the second order coefficient . in this case , the third order coefficient ca nt be brought to zero , but the numerical long term behaviour found in the problem of section  [ sc:5.1 ] is good , if @xmath135 is chosen so that there is a permutation symmetry between coordinates and momenta .",
    "numerically , the best results were obtained with a choice @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "this necessitates @xmath140 to zero the second order coefficient .",
    "we conclude that the long term behaviour of the method is not evident from considering the conservation of the hamiltonian alone .",
    "in addition to the conservation of the hamiltonian , we are interested in the conservation of the symplectic form , or the symplecticity of the method . in local coordinates ,",
    "the condition for symplecticity of an integration method @xmath141 over one step @xmath63 is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the jacobian of the map @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we consider first symplecticity in the extended phase space @xmath144 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath145 and @xmath100 are identity maps , then the method is symplectic .",
    "however , we know that this does not lead to good numerical results in the long term . to investigate other possibilities , we again apply the method for two steps and expand the left side of equation in terms of @xmath63 .",

    "methods 1 and 2 show similar qualitative behaviour as the lsode solution , while the midpoint method shows a clear divergence .",
    "these results needs to be contrasted with the amounts of vector field evaluations , which are @xmath206 ( method 1 ) , @xmath207 ( method 2 ) , @xmath207 ( implicit midpoint ) and @xmath208 ( lsode ) .",
    "the number of evaluations is roughly similar for each method , and as such method 1 is rather clearly the best of the constant timestep methods , with lsode likely the best overall .    ,",
    "@xmath192 and @xmath193 , integrated until @xmath202 , with method 1 ( solid line , top left ) , method 2 ( dotted line , top right ) , the lsode method ( dash - dotted line , bottom left ) , and the implicit midpoint method ( dashed line , bottom right ) . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "perhaps the most obvious benefit of splitting methods is that they re explicit , which eliminates all problems inherent in having to find iterative solutions .",
    "specifically , if evaluating the vector field , or parts of it , is very computationally intensive , then explicit methods are to be preferred , as they only require a single evaluation of the vector field for each step of the algorithm .",
    "leapfrog methods can also be composited with large degrees of freedom , making it possible to optimize the method used for the specific task at hand .",
    "more subtly , when the problem separates to asymmetric kinetic and potential parts , different algorithmic regularization schemes can be used to yield very powerful ( even exact ) , yet simple integrators @xcite .    however , for the case when the hamiltonian remains unspecified , algorithmic regularization seems to yield little benefit , since both parts of the new hamiltonian are essentially identical .",
    "this is problematic , since the leapfrog integration of an inseparable hamiltonian typically leads to wrong results only when the system is in `` difficult '' regions of the phase space , such as near the schwarzschild radius for the case in section  [ sc:5.1 ] , where the derivatives have very large numerical values and the expansions - may not converge for the chosen value of timestep .",
    "this is exactly the problem that algorithmic regularization solves , and it would be greatly beneficial if such a scheme could be employed even for the artificial splitting of the hamiltonian in .     despite the lack of algorithmic regularization , the extended phase space methods seem promising .",
    "the results in section  [ sc:5.1 ] demonstrate that the extended phase space methods can give results comparable to an established differential equation solver , lsode , but with less computational work .",
    "more importantly , the results are superior to a known symplectic method , the implicit midpoint method .",
    "the results in section  [ sc:5.2 ] are less conclusive with respect to the lsode method , but clear superiority versus the implicit midpoint method is still evident .",
    "we find this encouraging , and believe that the extended phase space methods should be investigated further .",
    "obvious candidate for further research is the best possible form and use of the mixing and projection maps .",
    "the optimal result is likely problem dependent .",
    "another issue that would benefit from investigation is how to find algorithmic regularization schemes for the split , preferably with as loose constraints on the form of the original hamiltonian as possible .",
    "finally , whether useful integrators can be obtained from the splits of types - should be investigated .",
    "we have presented a way to construct splitting method integrators for hamiltonian problems where the hamiltonian is inseparable , by introducing a copy of the original phase space , and a new hamiltonian which leads to equations of motion that can be directly integrated .",
    "we have also shown how the phase space extension can be used to construct similar leapfrogs for general problems that can be reduced to a system of first order differential equations .",
    "we have then implemented various examples of the new leapfrogs , including a higher order composition .",
    "these methods have then been applied to the problem of geodesics in a curved space and a non - linear , non - conservative forced oscillator . with these examples , we have demonstrated that utilizing both the auxiliary and original variables in deriving the final result , via the mixing and projection maps , instead of discarding one pair as is done in @xcite and @xcite , can yield better results than established methods , such as the implicit midpoint method .",
    "the new methods share some of the benefits of the standard leapfrog methods in that they re explicit , time - symmetric and only depend on the state of the system during the previous step . for a hamiltonian problem of the type in section  [ sc:5.1 ]",
    "they also have no secular growth in the error in the hamiltonian . however , the extended phase space methods leave large degrees of freedom in how to mix the variables in the extended phase space , and how to project them back to the original dimension . as",
    "such , there is likely room for further improvement in this direction , as well as in the possibility of deriving a working algorithmic regularization scheme for these methods . in conclusion , we find the extended phase space methods to be an interesting class of numerical integrators , especially for hamiltonian problems .",
