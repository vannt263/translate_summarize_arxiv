    "<S> the recent surge of interest in negative index of refraction materials @xcite , or negative index media ( nim ) , has prompted a reanalysis of many conventional results for waveguide devices , and a subsequent search for exotic transmission characteristics when incorporating this particular composite media , or metamaterial , into a variety of waveguide configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> a crucial feature of nim , is the frequency dispersion of the permittivity , @xmath0 , and permeability , @xmath1 , with @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously rendered negative over a particular bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this results in wave propagation in which the phase velocity and energy flow of an electromagnetic wave can be antiparallel , and also the possibility of a negative index of refraction , proposed long ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of various nim based open waveguide structures and resonators during the past few years has demonstrated a number of interesting effects : it was shown @xcite that a quasi 1-d bilayer resonator containing a nim layer can be substantially smaller than the usual cavity size due to phase cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of a thin planar nim waveguide , the tm mode can propagate for arbitrary widths and posses a single mode for slow waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> guided te modes were also shown to have electric field profiles containing nodes @xcite , and exhibit a sign - varying poynting vector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results were reported in circular nim fibers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> distortion of the circular dielectric waveguide into an elliptical guide , while maintaining the cross sectional area , has been shown to reduce attenuation of the dominant mode @xcite and modal degeneracy , allowing for practical guiding of traveling electromagnetic waves . </S>",
    "<S> attenuation effects and power flow expressions were achieved for wave propagation in a surface wave transmission line with an elliptical cross section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that some modes in the guide have lower attenuation than the corresponding modes in a circular guide . </S>",
    "<S> the slow and fast hybrid mode spectrum in a metallic elliptical waveguide with a confocal dielectric lining was also calculated @xcite , demonstrating the potential for a surface wave transmission device . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the distribution of electromagnetic fields in a double layer elliptical waveguide was calculated to first order and revealed in some cases , dispersion solutions where the power and phase velocity directions are antiparallel@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spurred by the recent theoretical and experimental advances in nim waveguides and resonators , we examine in this paper , open nim waveguides with elliptical cross sections , affording a greater flexibility in the parameter space determined by the geometry and material constraints . </S>",
    "<S> for a given eccentricity , @xmath2 , we calculate the permitted propagation constants over a range of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the allowed modes are separated into fast and slow propagating regions of the dispersion diagram , where wave localization is demonstrated in the form of electric field distributions .     and @xmath3 are in general both negative , and frequency dispersive . </S>",

    "<S> it is thus appropriate for the geometry under consideration to work in an orthogonal elliptical coordinate system described by the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> two linearly independent periodic solutions exist , akin to the trigonometric @xmath43 and @xmath44 functions : the even and odd angular mathieu functions , denoted @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . for the elliptical waveguide problem </S>",
    "<S> , the angular mathieu functions must be periodic with period @xmath47 and of integer order , otherwise the solution set is nonperiodic and can be unstable @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the angular mathieu functions are also periodic in @xmath7 only for special characteristic values of @xmath39 , denoted here as @xmath48 for the even solutions and @xmath49 for the odd ones . </S>",
    "<S> the radial mathieu equation ( [ modmat ] ) , admits two general types of solutions : the radial mathieu functions of the first and second kind . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of the first kind are divided into even and odd functions denoted as , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the characteristics numbers and the fourier coefficients are exactly the same as for the angular functions . in identifying a convenient series expansion to compute the radial mathieu functions , </S>",
    "<S> a number of techniques are applicable@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found , in agreement with past works , that the bessel @xmath52 product series are the most stable basis of functions to use @xcite . not surprisingly , the @xmath53 and @xmath54 functions coalesce into @xmath52 , as the elliptical cross section degenerates to a circular one . </S>",
    "<S> the mathieu functions of the second kind for @xmath55 are denoted @xmath56 ( even ) , and @xmath57 ( odd ) , and are calculated similarly , except the series expansion involve products of both the bessel @xmath58 and @xmath52 functions . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are analogous to the bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath58 , in circular coordinates . when @xmath61 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 transform into @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( analogous to the bessel @xmath64 functions ) , and they are related @xcite , e.g. , for even order , @xmath65 $ ] . for a general cylindrical open guide with circular cross section , </S>",
    "<S> pure te or tm modes exist only for symmetrical electromagnetic fields , i.e. , independent of the azimuthal angle . </S>",
    "<S> for an open elliptical waveguide however , the reduction in symmetry forces the electromagnetic modes in a given region to be hybrid in that both the longitudinal fields , @xmath35 and @xmath36 exist simultaneously ( @xmath28 denotes the region ) </S>",
    "<S> . based on the discussion above , it is clear that field solutions in an elliptical domain are split into even and odd components : @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure adopted here consists of writing @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) waves as products involving even ( odd ) mathieu functions , and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) waves in terms of odd ( even ) mathieu functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complete solution is then expanded as products of angular and radial mathieu functions of the requisite parity , and that obey the radiative condition . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions constrain the types of mathieu functions used in the expansions @xcite , as we require  stationary waves \" in the transverse @xmath7 and @xmath6 direction . within each region , we thus seek solutions of the form ,    [ fields1 ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants , and the coefficients @xmath75 , and @xmath76 contain the  radial \" dependence to the fields , given below . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> the methodology used here will focus on waves of even parity , as the procedure for odd waves is similar .    within the waveguide region ( see fig .  [ coord ] ) , the solutions are the radial mathieu functions of the first kind , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . for the guided modes of interest here , the fields must decay from the surface at @xmath79 , and therefore within the surrounding medium we have , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . with this requirement on the fields , and for a given set of material and geometrical parameters , </S>",
    "<S> a restricted number of waveguide modes exist . to determine the allowed modes , the tangential @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields are matched at the boundary @xmath79 separating the two media . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-dependence is integrated out by making use of the orthogonality properties of the angular mathieu functions ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then cast the boundary matched equations into a linear equation system containing in principle , an infinite hierarchy of mathieu functions . </S>",
    "<S> the higher order mathieu functions arise from the lack of one - to - one correspondence between the angular mathieu functions in regions with differing material parameters : the arguments of the angular mathieu functions depends on the parameter @xmath84 , which in turn depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the relative media . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to a circular waveguide , where the angular dependence is a function of only integer multiples of the azimuthal coordinate , @xmath85 .    in order to find the nontrivial solution </S>",
    "<S> , the problem of finding the allowed modes thus amounts to finding where the associated determinant of the linear equation system vanishes over a range of frequencies , propagation constants and ellipticities . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology we shall discuss is valid for hybrid @xmath86 or @xmath87 ( the first letter represents the dominant field ) modes @xcite , with small @xmath2 , and frequencies corresponding to small @xmath88 ( and small @xmath89 ) . under these conditions , the expansions in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fields1 ] ) can be limited to the first few terms . </S>",

    "<S> the quantities @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , outlined in the appendix , arise from the integrals of products of overlapping angular mathieu functions . </S>",
    "<S> writing the dispersion relation explicitly in this way reduces computational time considerably by avoiding unstable numerical determinants of large matrices and the associated multiple function calls to higher order mathieu functions . </S>",
    "<S> the odd mode spectrum is easily obtained via the interchange @xmath96 . as the elliptical cross section degenerates into a circular one , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and the mathieu functions appropriately transform into their corresponding cylindrical bessel functions : @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . in this limit , the dispersion relation ( [ tran ] ) reduces to the familiar characteristic equation for a circular waveguide : @xmath101 ^ 2=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ results ]    , is normalized by the free space wavenumber @xmath104 and is plotted as a function of the operating frequency for a cross section corresponding to an ellipticity of @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the characteristic frequencies in the material dispersion to be @xmath106 ghz , and @xmath107 ghz , which corresponds to @xmath108 within the frequency range , @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the mode spectra illustrates the slow and fast modes , separated by the @xmath110 curve . </S>",
    "<S> if the nim core is replaced with media corresponding to positive @xmath111 and @xmath3 ( bottom panel ) , the slow wave solution is absent and the curves vary in an opposite sense . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ tran ] ) are allowed mode solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid waves that are explored here can possess even and odd components , and are denoted appropriately in subsequent figures . </S>",
    "<S> we present the propagation constant in terms of the convenient dimensionless ratio , @xmath113 , and the frequency units are all in ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide cross section is assumed to not deviate greatly from that of a circular guide , reflected in moderate values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity and permeability in the nim regions , @xmath111 and @xmath3 , respectively , have the frequency dispersive form , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the effective electrical and magnetic plasma frequencies @xcite , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ tran ] ) , and its odd counterpart , for a waveguide with eccentricity , @xmath105 . for clarity , </S>",
    "<S> only four neighboring sets of dispersion curves within the given frequency window are shown . </S>",
    "<S> two sets reside completely beneath the @xmath110 curve , one set entirely outside of it , and another set that traverses both regions . for this geometry and range of frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the paired even - odd mode solutions follow similar trends , separating at higher frequencies . the solutions to the helmholtz equation </S>",
    "<S> ( eq .  [ helm ] ) depend on the eccentricity , @xmath2 , of the elliptical guide through the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 . </S>",

    "<S> in general , each branch of the even and odd modal curves coalesce at cutoff , where the propagation constant approaches the free space value ( @xmath122 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion diagram portrays the allowed electromagnetic wave solutions that travel along the guide and it elucidates important information regarding the possible localization characteristics of guided modes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the first three sets of dispersion curves that satisfy @xmath123 correspond to conventional surface waves . within this parameter space region , </S>",
    "<S> the phase velocity of guided waves , @xmath124 , exceeds the phase velocity of waves in a homogeneous bulk medium , i.e. , @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> these _ fast _ wave solutions to maxwell s equations will decay in the air region , but not necessarily in the waveguide core . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as the structure increases in size , or as @xmath126 decreases ( increasing @xmath127 ) , the electric and magnetic fields inside the waveguide oscillate with shorter wavelengths . at cutoff , @xmath128 ( thus @xmath129 ) , and the ensuing decay length increases outside the guiding surface . </S>",
    "<S> this causes a significant portion of the energy flow to occur in the air region , where the fields can then become less sensitive to the relevant geometrical parameters , such as the ratio @xmath130 .    </S>",

    "<S> these _ slow _ wave solutions are noticeably absent when @xmath111 and @xmath3 are strictly positive ( see bottom panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of nim sets up a non - oscillatory field profile that rapidly decays outside the guide , allowing for the possibility of guided modes that are more localized to the surface , akin to surface plasmon waves on metal surfaces studied long ago . </S>",
    "<S> note that as @xmath31 increases , @xmath121 typically increases , in which case the radial mathieu functions decay sharply , confining the field more to the waveguide . </S>",
