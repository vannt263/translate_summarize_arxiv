    "this work is motivated by the study of the global behavior of a planar map having a fixed point which is asymptotically stable but is not a global attractor . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that it can happen even when there is no periodic points different from the fixed point . actually , they construct examples of planar dissipative homeomorphisms @xmath3 such that the set @xmath4 is a cantor set with almost automorphic dynamics , being @xmath5 the set of recurrent points of @xmath3 and @xmath6 the asymptotically stable fixed point .",
    "besides , they show that this behaviour is strongly related to the fact that these planar attractors have irrational rotation number .",
    "as we are interested in systems with symmetry , in this work we construct symmetric and orientation preserving dissipative homeomorphisms in the plane with an asymptotically stable fixed point and irrational rotation number .",
    "these examples have no periodic points different from the fixed point and also present a complicated dynamical features .",
    "this constructions is based on the dissipative homeomorphisms given in @xcite ,    let @xmath7 be an orientation preserving homeomorphism with a fixed point which is not a global attractor and its basin of attraction is unbounded . in that case , theory of prime ends due to carathodory is applied and @xmath3 induces an orientation preserving homeomorphism @xmath8 in the space of prime ends . since this space is homeomorphic to the circle , it is possible to associate a rotation number to @xmath3 being the rotation number of @xmath8 .",
    "the authors prove in @xcite that if @xmath3 is dissipative and has an irrational rotation number , then the induced map in the space of prime ends is always conjugated to a denjoy map .",
    "otherwise , they prove in @xcite that periodic orbits different from fixed points can appear when the rotation number is rational .    given a lie group @xmath9 acting on @xmath2 , a map @xmath7 is said to be @xmath10__equivariant _ _ ( or a @xmath10symmetric map ) if for all @xmath11 and @xmath12    @xmath13    in @xcite the authors prove that if the group @xmath9 is @xmath14 or contains any reflection , the local dynamics of the asymptotically stable fixed point implies global dynamics .",
