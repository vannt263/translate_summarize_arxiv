    "one of the most direct probes of the qgp is the radiation of thermal photons , emerging directly from the thermalized system and providing , in principle , the temperature in its hottest phases  @xcite .",
    "however , photons are largely produced in hadronic decays , as well as in qcd processes , such as annihilation and compton , that occur before thermalization .",
    "thermally produced photons must be distinguished from those produced primordially in qcd interactions and those from final state decays of hadrons .",
    "thus it is necessary to first determine the yield of photons that are produced in excess of the photons from known hadronic decay sources ( the background ) .",
    "direct photons are extracted from an inclusive photon measurement , largely composed of photons from hadronic decays , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the dominant source of background photons is the @xmath2 decay , thus it is essential to measure the @xmath2 yields , with precision , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "based on the measured @xmath2 @xmath1 spectrum , one can simulate the spectrum of photons from all known hadronic decays .",
    "this can then be subtracted from the inclusive photons to obtain a direct photon spectrum .    at rhic",
    ", we are in the fortunate position of having a large suppression of @xmath2 , thus reducing the background photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa ] shows the nuclear modification factor for @xmath2 at @xmath0  @xcite , 62 , and 17 gev  @xcite measured in central a+a collisions . at @xmath6  gev , the suppression of @xmath2 for @xmath7  gev / c is a constant factor of @xmath8 , relative to expectation from the binary - scaled ( scaled by @xmath9 ) yields measured in p+p collisions .    with a large suppression of the hadronic decay background , and assuming that the photons are not similarly suppressed due to an initial - state effect",
    ", the measurement of direct photons at high @xmath1 should be less difficult than at lower @xmath10 .",
    "even after subtracting the photons from hadronic decays , extracting the thermal photons is still more difficult .",
    "one has to disentangle different sources of direct photons .",
    "these include pqcd ( `` prompt '' ) photons from processes such as compton ( @xmath11 ) and annihilation ( @xmath12 ) , as well as bremsstrahlung ( which may also may be modified by the medium  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there is another possible mechanism for producing photons in a dense medium created in au+au collisions .",
    "it was proposed in  @xcite that the same processes contributing to `` jet quenching '' in the qgp could produce photons ( through compton scattering or @xmath13 annihilation ) .",
    "these are also pqcd photons but will henceforth be referred to in the text as `` jet quenching '' photons , while those pqcd photons that are not produced due to the dense medium will be referred to as `` prompt '' photons .",
    "finally there are the coveted `` thermal '' photons , ( @xmath14  gev ) , which are radiated from the au+au system and thus carry the temperature information of the system in its hottest phases .",
    "a measurement of direct photons has previously been made in heavy ion collisions at the cern - sps  @xcite .",
    "experiment wa98 measured an excess of photons above those from hadronic sources of 10 - 20% for @xmath15  gev / c in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "the measured excess , a 1@xmath16 effect , was found to be larger ( by @xmath17 a factor of 2 ) than the expected direct photon signal from initial pqcd processes , which was determined by measurements of direct photons in p+pb reactions at similar beam energies .",
    "the measurements in p+pb collisions and the scaling to pb+pb collisions have further uncertainties that must be taken into account when quantifying this excess .",
    "strong conclusions can not be made due to the experimental uncertainties on a relatively small direct photon signal above the large level of background .",
    "however , the measurement of direct photons in pb+pb collisions has provided constraints on the system temperature obtained from calculations of photons radiated from the qgp and/or hadron gas phases of a heavy ion collision at @xmath18  gev .",
    "direct photons are quantified as an excess above background , expressed as the double ratio written in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] .",
    "@xmath19 the numerator @xmath20 is the point - by - point measurement of the photon yields divided by the @xmath2 yields , in which much of the experimental uncertainties cancel .",
    "the denominator @xmath21 is the simulated photon yields from hadronic decays , based on a fit to the measured @xmath2 spectrum , divided by the fit .",
    "the direct photon measurement is shown in terms of this ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam_cent ] for the most central au+au collisions and for all other centrality selections in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam_allcent ] @xcite .",
    "the phenix measurement in p+p collisions is not shown here ( see  @xcite ) . at high @xmath1 ,",
    "the direct photon yields are shown to be consistent with pqcd calculations  @xcite and binary scaling ( @xmath9 scaling ) for all centralities .",
    "in central au+au collisions , the direct photon content is found to be twice as large as the background photon content at @xmath22  gev , due to the large suppression of background photons in central collisions .",
    "a large suppression of direct photons of factor 4 - 5 , as seen in the @xmath2 yields at high @xmath1 , can be ruled out .",
    "however , an interplay between a modest suppression and increased production due to another mechanism in heavy ion collisions , such as proposed in  @xcite , can not be ruled out . this will be further discussed in the following section .",
    "a thermal photon signal , expected at @xmath14  gev / c can not be extracted from the current measurement because the systematic uncertainties are too large . with the new run-4 data , we hope to be able to reduce the errors significantly .",
    "in this section , theoretical calculations of direct photons , including prompt photons and jet quenching photons , are compared .",
    "figure  [ fig : theory ] shows the direct photon yields calculated for central au+au collisions . the solid line is a pqcd calculation  @xcite for p+p collisions , where the prompt photon yields are scaled by @xmath9 for central au+au .",
    "the dashed line is another calculation of only the prompt photons , but includes parton energy loss affecting the photons originating from bremsstrahlung processes ( proposed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the dotted line is a different calculation including this same effect  @xcite , which agrees reasonably well with the former .",
    "finally the dashed - dotted line includes , in addition to this suppression , an enhancement of direct photons due to the jet quenching production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the thermal component is not included .    at @xmath23  gev / c ,",
    "the dashed line , which includes parton energy loss in the medium , is @xmath24% smaller than the solid line , which is pqcd with no medium modifications . at the same @xmath1 ,",
    "the dashed - dotted line , which includes jet quenching photons , is @xmath25% larger than the solid pqcd line .",
    "the deviations from the @xmath9-scaled pqcd calculation become smaller at higher @xmath1 . with reduced systematic errors ,",
    "one will hopefully be able to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "another possible means to distinguish between jet quenching photons and the prompt photons is to measure the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath26 of the direct photons .",
    "since jet quenching is sensitive to the reaction plane , i.e. there is more suppression out - of - plane than in - plane , we measure a positive @xmath26 for hadrons . correspondingly",
    ", the photons produced in this mechanism should exhibit a negative @xmath26 .",
    "this , however , is another difficult measurement because one has to disentangle the @xmath26 from the photons originating from hadronic decays , which is positive .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2 ] shows the measured @xmath26 for inclusive photons and for @xmath2 .    in the region of interest ( @xmath27  gev / c ) , the errors are very large . again from run 4",
    ", we hope to make this measurement with improved precision , and to higher @xmath1 , in order to be able to deduce @xmath26 of the direct photons over a large @xmath1 range .",
    "phenix has measured direct photons up to @xmath22  gev / c in centrality bins of 10% .",
    "the yields of photons in excess of those from hadronic decays are consistent with a pqcd calculation and binary scaling for all centralities . a large suppression in central au+au collisions , as that observed for hadronic yields ,",
    "is ruled out by the data .",
    "a modest suppression and/or enhancement can not be ruled out with the current systematic errors . with the run-4 data , we hope to reduce the systematic uncertainties on the direct photon measurement to be able to extract a thermal photon signal , if present . to help distinguish between different sources of direct photons",
