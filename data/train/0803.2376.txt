    "a lie bialgebroid , as introduced by mackenzie & xu , is a pair of lie algebroids @xmath11 satisfying some compatibility condition @xcite .",

    ", roytenberg proved that the lie bialgebroid compatibility condition is equivalent to the equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a certain hamitonian function on the super - symplectic manifold @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to prove a quantum analogue of this condition .",
    "more precisely , consider a pair of ( real or complex ) lie algebroid structures on a vector bundle @xmath0 and its dual @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the line bundle ( real or complex ) @xmath15 exists .",
    "then @xmath3 is a module over @xmath2 , as discovered by evens , lu & weinstein @xcite , and the lie algebroid structures of @xmath2 and @xmath0 induce two natural differential operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see equations to ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the sum @xmath18 .",
    "our main theorem can be summarized as follows :    [ thm : a ] the pair @xmath8 is a lie bialgebroid over @xmath1 if , and only if , the operator @xmath19 is the multiplication by a function @xmath20 .    since the problem is local in nature , we may assume the existence of a volume form @xmath21 on @xmath1 and a pair of nowhere vanishing top degree forms @xmath22 and @xmath23 dual to each other . hence one can consider the modular cocycles @xmath24 and @xmath25 associated to the lie algebroids @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively @xcite .",
    "a simple computation shows that , for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bv - operator of the lie algebroid @xmath0 @xcite @xmath29-dual to the lie algebroid differential @xmath30 ( see ) and @xmath31 is the `` laplacian '' @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the problem reduces to prove the following    [ thm : b ] for a pair of lie algebroids @xmath8 , @xmath33 if , and only if , @xmath8 is a lie bialgebroid .",
    "note that the laplacian @xmath31 has already appeared in a variety of contexts .",
    "for example , the laplacian of the lie bialgebroid @xmath34 associated to a poisson manifold @xmath35 was fruitfully exploited by evens & lu to compute the cohomology of flag varieties @xcite .",
    "part of the motivation behind this work is to better understand the dirac generating operators of the courant algebroids associated to manin triples .",
    "courant algebroids were introduced in @xcite as a way to merge the concept of lie bialgebra and the bracket on @xmath36  here @xmath1 is a smooth manifold  first discovered by courant @xcite .",
    "roytenberg gave an equivalent definition phrased in terms of the dorfman bracket @xcite , which highlighted the relation of courant algebroids to @xmath37-algebras as was observed by roytenberg & weinstein @xcite .",
    "kosmann - schwarzbach s derived brackets @xcite provide another way of thinking of courant algebroids .",
    "roytenberg translated them in symplectic supermanifold language to study courant algebroids @xcite .",
    "they also motivated the following construction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 be a vector bundle endowed with a non degenerate pseudo - metric @xmath39 on its fibers , and let @xmath40 be the associated bundle of clifford algebras .",
    "assume there exists a bundle of clifford modules @xmath41 , i.e. a vector bundle whose fiber is the clifford module of the fiber of @xmath42 .",
    "the natural @xmath43-grading of @xmath44 induces a @xmath43-grading on the operators on @xmath45 .",
    "the multiplication by a function @xmath46 is an even operator while the clifford action of a section @xmath47 is odd . _",
    "a dirac generating operator _ , according to alekseev & xu @xcite , is an odd operator @xmath48 on @xmath49 satisfying the following properties :    * for all @xmath46 , the operator @xmath50 is the clifford action of some section of @xmath51 . * for all @xmath52 , the operator @xmath53 is the clifford action of some section of @xmath51 . *",
    "the square of @xmath48 is the multiplication by some function on @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath48 is a generating operator , then the derived bracket @xmath54 on @xmath55  here @xmath56 stands for the graded commutator on the space of graded operators on @xmath49  together with the bundle map @xmath57 given by @xmath58 endow @xmath59 with a courant algebroid structure .    in @xcite ,",
    "alekseev & xu have proposed a construction of dirac generating operators valid for arbitrary courant algebroids using courant algebroid connections .",
    "when @xmath60 , kosmann - schwarzbach considered the so called _ deriving operators _ , which generate the courant algebroid in the above sense , without requiring that the square of @xmath48 be the multiplication by some function @xcite . in particular , for a lie bialgebroid , she proved by a direct argument that @xmath61 ( in a slightly different form ) is a deriving operator . combining kosmann - schwarzbach s result with theorem  [ thm : a ]",
    ", we immediately obtain the following    [ thm : c ] given a pair of lie algebroids @xmath8 , it is a lie bialgebroid if , and only if , the operator @xmath61 is a dirac generating operator for the vector bundle @xmath62 with the inner product .",
    "although the sufficient condition is just the particularization of alekseev & xu s result to the case of lie bialgebroids , the necessary condition is new .",
    "our starting point is completely different from that in @xcite .",
    "alekseev & xu proved the local existence of dirac generating operators for general courant algebroids . by applying it to the case of manin triples of lie bialgebroids",
    ", they proved the sufficient condition in theorem  [ thm : c ] .",
    "then they derived that @xmath19 is a function as a consequence . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach is , in a certain sense , to take the opposite route .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : a ] by reducing it to theorem  [ thm : b ] , which can be verified by a direct argument",
    ". then theorem  [ thm : c ] follows immediately .",
    "indeed the heart of our approach consists in establishing a list of new identities ( see theorem  [ thm : c ] ) , which we believe deserve attention in their own right .",
    "note that the derived brackets of the courant algebroid @xmath63 have played an important role in the rapid development of the generalized complex geometry of hitchin and gualtieri @xcite , where many remarkable results have been established .",
    "we hope our result will be of some use in this subject .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 gives a succinct account of standard facts about courant algebroids , lie bialgebroids and dirac generating operators , whose purpose is to fix the notations .",
    "the differential operator @xmath10 is defined in section 2 and the main theorems are then stated without proofs .",
    "section 3 establishes a list of important identities valid in any pair of lie algebroids @xmath8 , which are subsequently used in section 4 to prove the statements of section 2 .",
    "our results are then particularized to a few concrete situations in section 5 .",
    "namely , we discuss the cases of exact lie bialgebroids , poisson nijenhuis lie algebroids and finally @xmath64 lie bialgebras .",
