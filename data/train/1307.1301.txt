    "recently , the ultracold fermi gas has attracted much attention as a useful quantum system to study many - body physics in a strongly interacting fermion system@xcite . in particular , using a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite , we can now study superfluid properties from the weak - coupling bcs regime to the strong - coupling bec limit in a unified manner@xcite . in the intermediate coupling regime , which is referred to as the bcs - bec crossover region in the literature ,",
    "physical properties of a system are dominated by pairing fluctuations .",
    "thus , in this regime , the possibility of the so - called pseudogap phenomenon has been discussed@xcite , where preformed cooper pairs cause a gap - like structure in the single - particle excitation spectrum even in the normal state .    however , the existence of the pseudogap in ultracold fermi gases is still in debate .",
    "the photoemission - type experiment on a @xmath4k fermi gas has observed anomalous single - particle excitation spectra in the bcs - bec crossover region@xcite , which supports the pseudogap scenario@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the local pressure measurement on a @xmath5li fermi gas denies the pseudogap , where the experimental data are reported to be simply explained by the normal fermi liquid theory@xcite .",
    "thus , although it has been pointed out that the latter experimental result can be also explained by the pseudogap scenario@xcite , further studies are necessary to resolve this important problem .    in considering this many - body problem ,",
    "extensive work done in high-@xmath2 cuprates would be helpful . in this strongly correlated electron system",
    ", the pseudogapped density of states has been observed in the underdoped regime@xcite , although the origin of this phenomenon still remains to be solved , due to the complexity of this system .",
    "in addition to this , in the underdoped regime , the so - called spin - gap phenomenon has been observed , where the uniform susceptibility , as well as the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate ( nmr-@xmath6 ) , exhibit anomalous temperature dependences@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "we note that , when the pseudogap really exists in the bcs - bec crossover regime of cold fermi gases , since the spin susceptibility @xmath1 is deeply related to the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath1 would be suppressed by this phenomenon . furthermore , the pseudogap in cold fermi gases originates from pairing fluctuations being accompanied by preformed cooper pairs , these singlet pairs would also suppress the spin susceptibility .",
    "thus , as a probe to examine the pseudogap phenomenon in cold fermi gases , the uniform spin susceptibility may be useful .",
    "we briefly note that the observation of this quantity has recently become possible in cold fermi gases@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate magnetic properties of an ultracold fermi gas in the normal state . in considering this problem , we recall that the strong - coupling coupling theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite , as well as the ordinary @xmath0-matrix theory@xcite , that have been extensively used to clarify various bcs - bec crossover physics in cold fermi gases , unphysically give _ negative _ susceptibility in the crossover region@xcite .",
    "this difficulty has been , however , recently overcome by properly including higher order fluctuation effects beyond the @xmath0-matrix level@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also employ this extended @xmath0-matrix theory to calculate the uniform ( pseudo)spin susceptibility @xmath1 .",
    "we show how this quantity is affected by pairing fluctuations in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "we also introduce the spin - gap temperature as the temperature below which @xmath1 is suppressed by the preformed pair formation . in this paper , we take @xmath7 , and the system volume is taken to be unity , for simplicity .",
    "( double solid line ) .",
    "the single solid line describes the green s function @xmath8 for a free fermi gas .",
    "( b ) self - energy correction @xmath9 in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory .",
    "the dashed line describes the pairing interaction @xmath10 .",
    "( c ) particle - particle scattering matrix @xmath11 .",
    "we note that the bare green s function @xmath12 is still used in @xmath11 in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory@xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas , described by the bcs hamiltonian , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the creation operator of a fermi atom in the hyperfine state described by pseudospin @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath17-spin component , measured from the chemical potential @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is an atomic mass ) .",
    "when one writes the chemical potential as @xmath20 , @xmath21 may be viewed as an effective magnetic field , which we will use in calculating the spin susceptibility @xmath1 . when @xmath22 , the system has a population imbalance @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the total number of fermi atoms in the @xmath17-spin component ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , @xmath25 is a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore effects of a harmonic trap in this paper .    as usual",
    ", we measure the interaction strength in terms of the @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath27 , given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a cut - off energy . in this scale , the weak - coupling bcs regime and the strong - coupling bec regime",
    "are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ( where @xmath32 is the fermi momentum ) .",
    "the crossover region is characterized as @xmath33 .    the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath1 is calculated from @xmath34 in this paper , we numerically evaluate eq.([eq.2 ] ) , by taking a small but finite value of @xmath21 . the particle number @xmath24 in the @xmath17-spin component in eq.([eq.2 ] ) is calculated from @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the single - particle thermal green s function , having the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermion matsubara frequency .",
    "the self - energy @xmath9 involves fluctuation corrections to single - particle excitations . in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory@xcite ,",
    "it is diagrammatically given by fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "summing up the diagrams in this figure , one has @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the boson matsubara frequency .",
    "the particle - particle scattering matrix @xmath11 has the form , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the lowest - order pair correlation function .",
    "@xmath43 is the single - particle green s function for a free fermi gas .",
    "the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 is conveniently determined from the thouless criterion , @xmath44 together with the equation for the total number @xmath45 of fermi atoms , @xmath46 in solving the coupled equations ( [ eq.8 ] ) and ( [ eq.9 ] ) , we set @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . we show the calculated @xmath2 in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "once @xmath2 is determined , we only solve the number equation ( [ eq.9 ] ) above @xmath2 for a small but finite value of @xmath21 , to determine the average chemical potential @xmath49 .",
    "we then calculate the spin susceptibility in eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) . in this procedure , the small value of @xmath21 is chosen so that the numerator in eq.([eq.2 ] ) be proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "we briefly note that the ordinary ( non - selfconsistent ) @xmath0-matrix theory is recovered , when the full green s function @xmath50 in fig.[fig1](a ) is simply replaced by the non - interacting one @xmath51 .",
    "because of this improvement , the calculated spin susceptibility in the present extended @xmath0-matrix theory satisfies the required positivity in the whole bcs - bec crossover region@xcite .     as a function of temperature .",
    "@xmath52 is the spin susceptibility at @xmath53 for a free fermi gas , @xmath54 is the fermi temperature .",
    "@xmath32 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the arrows show the spin - gap temperatures .",
    "( b ) spin - gap temperature @xmath55 ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashes line shows @xmath3.,width=377 ]",
    "as a characteristic temperature to describe this non - monotonic behavior of @xmath1 , we conveniently define the spin - gap temperature @xmath61 as the temperature at which the spin susceptibility takes a maximum value .",
    "when we plot @xmath61 in the bcs - bec crossover region , we obtain fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "although @xmath61 is not accompanied by any phase transition , this crossover temperature physically means that preformed singlet pairs start to appear around this temperature .    to understand the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath1 in a simple manner , we divide the number equation ( [ eq.9 ] ) into the sum of the non - interacting part , @xmath62 and the fluctuation contribution @xmath63 , as @xmath64 .",
    "when we simply assume that , while the non - interacting part behaves as a free fermi gas , the fluctuation component @xmath63 does not contribute to @xmath1 because of their singlet formation , @xmath1 may be simply estimated as @xmath65 as shown in fig.[fig3](a ) , while @xmath66 simply increases with increasing the temperature , @xmath67 decreases due to the enhancement of pairing fluctuations near @xmath2 . as a result , eq.([eq.100 ] ) exhibits a non - monotonic temperature dependence , which is qualitatively consistent with @xmath1 in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory .",
    "( see fig.[fig3](b ) . )",
    "we note that , in contrast to the complicated high-@xmath2 cuprates , the bcs - bec crossover physics of cold fermi gases is simply dominated by pairing fluctuations .",
    "thus , both the pseudogap phenomenon and spin - gap phenomenon in this system are attributed to fluctuations in the cooper channel . in this case , if the pseudogap really exists in the single - particle density of states , the ` ( pseudo)gap energy ' would reflect the ` binding energy ' of a preformed cooper pair .",
    "thus , the spin - gap temperature @xmath61 is expected to be related to the pseudogap temperature ( @xmath68 ) evaluated from the density of states@xcite .",
    "however , comparing @xmath61 with @xmath68 , the former is found to be higher than the latter@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the spin susceptibility is more sensitive to pairing fluctuations being accompanied by preformed pairs than the density of states ( although the detailed comparison of @xmath61 with @xmath68 somehow depends on their definitions , because they are crossover temperatures ) .    , and spin susceptibility @xmath66 for a free fermi gas , as functions of temperature .",
    "( b ) comparison of @xmath1 calculated in the extended @xmath0-matrix approximation and eq .",
    "( [ eq.100 ] ) . in this figure",
    ", we take @xmath69.,width=377 ]",
    "to summarize , we have discussed the spin susceptibility @xmath1 in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas . within the framework of an extended @xmath0-matrix theory , we showed that @xmath1 exhibits a non - monotonic temperature dependence in the crossover region , reflecting the formation of preformed singlet cooper pairs .",
    "we have also determined the spin - gap temperature @xmath61 as the temperature at which @xmath1 takes a maximum value .",
    "this crossover temperature is higher than the pseudogap temperature evaluated from the single - particle density of states , indicating that the spin susceptibility is a useful probe to examine strong - coupling phenomena in this system .",
    "since the pseudogap phenomenon is an important topic in the bcs - bec crossover regime of ultracold fermi gases , our results would be helpful for further understanding of this many - body phenomenon .",
