    "describing collective motion in a strongly correlated many - body system in terms of single particle degrees of freedom is sometimes not feasible .",
    "even if one can solve the problem with the help of large - scale numerical calculations , such a practice may not always be interesting because physics can be totally buried in the numerous configurations used in the calculation . in the cuprate systems exhibiting high - temperature superconducting ( sc ) properties",
    ", there is a substantial point of view ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the many - body correlations are so strong that the dynamics can no longer be described meaningfully in terms of individual particles . on the other hand ,",
    "similar questions were also asked long ago in nuclear physics .",
    "nuclear physicists have developed a completely different approach to solve the many - body problems .",
    "the approach is based on the fact that collective motions in such quantum many - body systems are often governed by only a few collective degrees of freedom .",
    "once these degrees of freedom are identified and properly incorporated into a model , calculations may become feasible and , most importantly , the physics may become transparent .",
    "one systematic way of identifying the relevant collective degrees of freedom in a many - body system is the method of dynamical symmetries .",
    "a quantum system exhibiting dynamical symmetries usually contains two or more competing collective modes . in nuclear physics",
    ", it has long been known that the transition from spherical nuclei , which dominate the beginnings and endings of nucleonic shells , to deformed nuclei , which often dominate the middle of shells , is controlled by the microscopic competition between long - range quadrupole - quadrupole interactions favoring deformed rotational mode and short - range monopole pairing interactions favoring spherical vibrational mode .",
    "this competition in nuclear physics may be expressed algebraically as a competition between a dynamical symmetry that favors pairing and a dynamical symmetry that favors multipole ( particle  hole ) interactions @xcite . besides nuclear physics , the dynamical symmetry method has also been applied in molecular physics @xcite and particle physics @xcite .    in cuprates , it is now widely agreed that the mechanism responsible for superconductivity is closely related to the unusual antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator properties of their normal states .",
    "there are also compelling arguments that the pair mechanism leading to high - temperature superconductivity does not correspond to ordinary bcs @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "although experimental evidence implicates singlet ( hole ) pairs as the carriers of the supercurrent , the interaction leading to the formation of the singlet pairs appears not to be the traditional lattice phonon mechanism underlying the bcs theory , but rather seems to originate in strong electron correlations .",
    "furthermore , the pairing gap is anisotropic , with nodes in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane strongly suggestive of @xmath0-wave hybridization in the 2-particle wavefunctions .",
    "such observations argue strongly for a theory based on continuous symmetries of the dynamical system that is capable of describing more sophisticated pairing than found in the simple bcs picture ( which is described by a single complex order parameter ) , and capable of unifying sc and af collective modes and the corresponding phases on an equivalent footing . then such fundamentally different physics as sc order and af order can emerge from the same effective hamiltonian as concentration variables ( e.g. , doping parameters )",
    "are varied . in this manuscript",
    ", we report on an su(4 ) model that we have recently developed @xcite aiming at understanding the mechanism that leads to high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "theoretical models employing algebras and groups can be found in the field of condensed matter ( for recent examples , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , to our knowledge , the powerful dynamical symmetry method of the type that we shall describe below has not been applied systematically in this field .",
    "a system possesses dynamical symmetries if the hamiltonian can be expressed as a polynomial in the casimir invariants of a subgroup chain . for approximately the same period of time that the high - tc compounds have been known , techniques based on dynamical symmetries in fermion degrees of freedom have been in development in the field of nuclear structure physics @xcite .",
    "there it has proven fruitful to ask the following questions : what are the most important collective degrees of freedom in the low - lying spectrum of complex nuclei , what are the microscopic many - body quantum operators that create and annihilate these modes , and what is the commutator algebra obeyed by this set of operators ?",
    "systematic investigation of these questions has led to strong confirmation of the following set of conjectures about the nuclear many - body system : ( 1 ) low - lying collective modes are in approximate one - to - one correspondence with dynamical symmetries in the fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "( 2 ) a dynamical symmetry corresponding to low - lying collective modes is associated with a lie algebra and its subalgebras that are formed from a set of fermion operators closed under commutation .",
    "( 3 ) different dynamical symmetry subgroup chains arising from the same highest symmetry group are associated with fundamentally different phases of the theory .",
    "these phases are unified in the highest group .",
    "( 4 ) the unification implied by the preceding point suggests that the many low - lying collective states formed by systematic filling of valence shells in heavy nuclei are in reality different projections in an abstract multidimensional space of the same state .",
    "equivalently , the different states are transformed into each other by the generators of the symmetry .",
    "thus , the systematics of collective modes and phase transitions as a function of concentration variables are specified by the group structure .    motivated by the observation that in a nuclear system at low - energy excitation , valence nucleon pairs tend to correlate strongly to form @xmath1 ( spin 0 ) pairs and @xmath0 ( spin 2 ) pairs , wu , feng , and guidry introduced @xmath1 and @xmath0 fermion pairs as the basic building blocks of the fermion dynamical symmetry model @xcite .",
    "these pair operators , when supplemented with the multipole operators , close either an @xmath4 or an @xmath5 algebra , depending on the choice of the basis @xcite . if one neglects the fermionic degrees of freedom of these pairs and treats them as bosons , one has the early interacting boson model @xcite of arima and iachello .",
    "all the dynamical symmetries emerging from these models have found correspondence with the known low - lying collective modes in nuclear systems , such as the spherical vibrational mode , deformed rotational mode , and @xmath6-unstable collective mode .",
    "it has been demonstrated that dynamical symmetries of the type described in ref .",
    "@xcite are realized to remarkably high accuracy in the spectrum and the wavefunctions of microscopic calculations using the projected shell model @xcite . since",
    "this model is of the shell - model type based on single - particle degrees of freedom , and is known to give extremely good agreement with a broad range of experimental data ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this provides rather conclusive proof that these dynamical symmetries are strongly realized in the low - lying states of complex nuclei .",
    "this raises the issue of whether similar symmetries might be found in other complex many - body fermion systems such as those important in condensed matter .",
    "the dynamical symmetry method applied in cuprates corresponds schematically to the following algorithm :    \\0 . assume the following conjecture : _ all strongly collective modes in fermion ( or boson ) many - body systems can be put into correspondence with a closed algebra defining a dynamical symmetry of the sort described below",
    "_ this is a conjecture , but there is so much evidence in support of it from various fields of physics that it is almost a theorem : strongly correlated motion implies a symmetry of the dynamics described by a lie algebra in the second - quantized operators implementing that motion .",
    "identify , within a suitable `` valence space '' , degrees of freedom that one believes are physically relevant for the problem at hand , guided by phenomenology , theory , and general principles . in the present case , that reduces to defining a minimal set of operators that might be important to describe superconductivity and antiferromagnetism .",
    "try to close a commutation algebra ( of manageable dimension ) with the second - quantized operators creating and annihilating the modes chosen in step 1 . if necessary , approximate these operators , or add additional ones to the set if the algebra does not close naturally .",
    "use standard lie algebra theory to identify relevant subalgebra chains that end in algebras for conservation laws that one expects to be obeyed for the problem at hand . in the present example , we require all group chains to end in @xmath7 , corresponding to an algebra implementing conservation of charge and spin .    \\4 . construct dynamical symmetry hamiltonians ( hamiltonian that are polynomials in the casimir invariants of a group chain ) for each chain .",
    "each such group chain thus defines a wavefunction basis labeled by the eigenvalues of chain invariants ( the casimirs and the elements of the cartan subalgebras ) , and a hamiltonian that is diagonal in that basis ( since it is constructed explicitly from invariants ) .",
    "thus , the schoedinger equation is solved analytically for each chain , by construction .",
    "calculate the physical implications of each of these dynamical symmetries by considering the wavefunctions , spectra , and transitional matrix elements of physical relevance .",
    "this is tractable , because the eigenvalues and eigenvectors were obtained in step 4 .",
    "consistency of the symmetry requires that transition operators be related to group generators ; otherwise transitions would mix irreducible multiplets and break the symmetry .",
    "if step 5 suggests that one is on the right track ( meaning that a wise choice was made in step 1 ) , one can write the most general hamiltonian for the system in the model space , which is just a linear combination of all the hamiltonians for the symmetry group chains . since the casimir operators of different group chains do not generally commute with each other , a casimir invariant for",
    "one group chain may be a symmetry - breaking term for another group chain .",
    "thus the competition between different dynamical symmetries and the corresponding phase transitions can be studied .",
    "the symmetry - limit solutions may be used as a starting point for more ambitious calculations that incorporate symmetry breaking .",
    "although no longer generally analytical , such more realistic approximations may be solved by perturbation theory around the symmetry solutions ( which are generally non - perturbative , so this is perturbation theory around a non - perturbative minimum ) , by numerical diagonalization of symmetry breaking terms , or by coherent state method as shown later .    of course",
    ", in practical calculations only a few carefully selected degrees of freedom can be included and the effect of the excluded space must be incorporated by renormalized interactions in the truncated space .",
    "it follows that the validity of such an approach hinges on a wise choice of the collective degrees of freedom and sufficient phenomenological or theoretical information to specify the corresponding effective interactions of the truncated space .",
    "we now introduce a mathematical formalism that provides a systematic implementation of the dynamical symmetry procedure for cuprate systems .      the basic assumption of the su(4 ) model is that the configuration space relevant for competing superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is built from _ coherent pairs _ formed from two electrons ( or holes ) centered on adjacent lattice sites . in cuprates",
    "the coherent pairs are believed to exhibit @xmath0-wave orbital symmetry @xcite , suggesting coexistence of two kinds of coherent pairs in a minimal model : the spin - singlet ( @xmath8 ) and the spin - triplet ( @xmath9 ) pairs .",
    "we adopt the @xmath0-wave pairs with structure defined in refs .",
    "@xcite as the basic _ dynamical building blocks _ of the su(4 ) model @xmath10 where @xmath11 creates an electron of momentum @xmath12 and spin projection @xmath13 or @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the @xmath0-wave form factor , and @xmath16 is an af ordering vector .",
    "these pair operators , when supplemented with operators of particle - hole type @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 constitute a 16-element operator set that is closed @xcite under a u(4 ) @xmath20 u(1 ) @xmath21 su(4 ) algebra if the condition @xmath22 is imposed . in eq .",

    "the u(1 ) factor , @xmath24 , in u(1 ) @xmath21 su(4 ) is associated with charge - density waves , which is independent of the su(4 ) algebra . for no broken pairs",
    "the charge - density waves are excluded in the symmetry limit and in the following discussion we shall restrict attention to the su(4 ) group .",
    "the su(4 ) group has three dynamical symmetry group chains",
    "@xcite : @xmath25 each of which ends in the subgroup @xmath26 representing total spin and charge conservation .",
    "the 15 su(4 ) generators are related to more physical operators through the linear combinations : @xmath27 it will also sometimes prove useful to replace the number operator @xmath28 with the charge operator @xmath29 , defined through @xmath30 .",
    "the group su(4 ) has a quadratic casimir operator @xmath31 the group is rank-3 and the irreducible representations ( irreps ) may be labeled by 3 weight - space quantum numbers , @xmath32 .",
    "we assume for the simplest implementation of the model a collective @xmath0-wave pair subspace spanned by the following vectors : @xmath33 this collective subspace is associated with irreps of the form @xmath34 where 2@xmath23 is the dimension of the single - particle space in the su(4 ) model , and thus @xmath23 is the maximum number of pairs that can be accommodated in the model space .",
    "the corresponding expectation value of the su(4 ) casimir evaluated in these irreps is a constant , @xmath35    the dimensionality of the full space is @xmath36 .",
    "however , the dimensionality of our collective subspace is much smaller , scaling approximately as @xmath37 : @xmath38 thus for small lattices it is possible to enumerate all states of the collective subspace in a simple model where observables can be calculated analytically .",
    "the most general 2-body hamiltonian within the @xmath0-wave pair space consists of a linear combination of ( quadratic ) casimir operators @xmath39 for all subgroups @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 are parameters and the casimir operators @xmath43 are @xmath44 for fixed electron number the terms in @xmath29 and @xmath45 in eq.([casimirs ] ) are constant .",
    "the term @xmath46 is a quadratic function of particle number and may be parameterized as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the effective single - electron energy and the average two - body interaction in zero - order approximation , respectively .",

    "1 illustrates these dynamical symmetries and the relation to the corresponding phases .",
    "the pairing gap @xmath64 ( measure of pairing order ) and the staggered magnetization ( measure of af order ) @xmath65 , @xmath66 may be used to characterize the states in these symmetry limits .",
    "we introduce also a relative doping fraction @xmath67 that is related to particle number and lattice degeneracy through @xmath68 since @xmath69 is the hole number when @xmath70 , positive @xmath67 represents the case of hole - doping , with @xmath71 corresponding to half filling ( no doping ) and @xmath72 to maximal doping .",
    "the dynamical symmetry chain @xmath73 which we shall term the so(4 ) limit , corresponds to long - range af order .",
    "this is the symmetry limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) when @xmath74 .",
    "the so(4 ) subgroup is locally isomorphic to @xmath75 , where the product group is generated by the linear combinations @xmath76 of the original so(4 ) generators @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "( [ q_s ] ) to the coordinate lattice space , @xmath82 implying that @xmath79 is the generator of total spin on even sites and @xmath80 is the generator of total spin on odd sites .",
    "thus , we may interpret the so(4 ) group as being generated by two independent spin operators : one that is the total spin on all sites and one that is the difference in spins on even and odd sites of the spatial lattice .",
    "this clearly is an algebraic version of the physical picture associated with af long - range order .",
    "furthermore , the ground state has maximal staggered magnetization @xmath83 and a large energy gap ( associated with the correlation @xmath84 ) @xmath85 that inhibits electronic excitation and favors magnetic insulator properties at half filling .",
    "in addition , the pairing gap @xmath86 is small near half filling ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that these so(4 ) states are identified naturally with an af insulating phase of the system .",
    "the dynamical symmetry chain @xmath87 which we shall term the su(2 ) limit , corresponds to sc order and is the @xmath63 symmetry limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) . in the ground state",
    ", there exists a large pairing gap @xmath88 the pairing correlation is the largest among the three symmetry limits , and the staggered magnetization vanishes in the ground state : @xmath89 thus we propose that this state is a pair condensate associated with a @xmath0-wave sc phase of the cuprates .",
    "the dynamical symmetry chain @xmath90 which we shall term the so(5 ) limit , appears when @xmath91 in eq.([eq20 ] ) .",
    "the so(5 ) dynamical symmetry has very unusual behavior .",
    "although the expectation values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for ground state in this symmetry limit are the same as that of eq.([deltaq ] ) for the su(2 ) case , there exists a huge number of states with different number of @xmath92 pairs that can mix easily with the ground state when @xmath67 is small .",
    "in particular , at half filling ( @xmath71 ) the ground state is highly degenerate with respect to configurations of different number of @xmath92 pairs .",
    "the @xmath92 pairs must be responsible for the antiferromagnetism in this phase , since within the model space only @xmath92 pairs carry spin .",
    "thus the ground state in this symmetry limit has large - amplitude fluctuation in the af order ( and sc order ) .",
    "this indicates that the so(5 ) symmetry limit is associated with phases in which the system is extremely susceptible to fluctuations between af and sc order .",
    "s. c. zhang proposed to unify af and sc states by assembling his order parameters into a five - dimensional vector and constructing an so(5 ) group that rotates af order into @xmath0-wave sc order @xcite .",
    "the zhang so(5 ) group is a subgroup of our su(4 ) group , implying that the two models are related to each other .",
    "the essential difference is that we implement the full quantum dynamics ( commutator algebra ) of these operators exactly , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics is implemented in an approximate manner : a subset of ten of the operators acts as a rotation on the remaining five operators @xmath93 , which are treated phenomenologically as five independent components of an order - parameter vector ( superspin @xmath94 ) .",
    "thus only 10 of the 15 generators of our su(4 ) are treated dynamically in the zhang so(5 ) model .",
    "if the full quantum dynamics ( full commutator algebra ) of the 15 operators is taken into account , the symmetry for cuprates must be su(4 ) , not so(5 ) .",
    "suppression of double occupancy on sites in the copper oxide planes is critical @xcite in explaining why cuprate systems are antiferromagnetic mott insulators at half filling and become superconductors through hole doping .",
    "to realize mott insulator phases at half - filling it is normal to impose a no - double - occupancy rule ",
    "the constraint that each lattice site can not have more than one valence electron  by gutzwiller projection @xcite .",
    "we now show an intimate relationship between the su(4 ) dynamical symmetry and realization of no - double - occupancy constraint in cuprates .",
    "the relationship can be clearly seen if we express the momentum - space operator sets ( [ d_pi ] ) and ( [ q_s ] ) , with no approximation to the @xmath0-wave formfactor @xmath95 , in the coordinate space as @xmath96 in eq .  ( [ rspace2 ] ) , lattice site is separated into @xmath97 even and @xmath97 odd sites .",
    "the summation is over even ( or odd ) sites of the lattice , denoted by @xmath98 , where the @xmath99 sign is + ( @xmath100 ) if @xmath98 is chosen to be even ( odd ) sites .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 is defined by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath105 located at @xmath106 , while @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath105 at its four neighboring sites , @xmath109 and @xmath110 with equal probabilities ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the lattice constants along the @xmath113 and @xmath114 directions , respectively , on the copper - oxide plane ) @xmath115 explicit commutation operations show that _ only if _ the no - double - occupancy constraint is imposed , so that the anticommutator relation @xmath116 is valid , does the operator set ( [ rspace2 ] ) close under the @xmath117 lie algebra @xcite .",
    "thus , the coordinate - space commutation algebra of the operators ( [ rspace2 ] ) demonstrates that su(4 ) symmetry _ necessarily implies _ a no - double - occupancy constraint in the copper oxide conducting plane .",
    "this suggests a fundamental relationship between su(4 ) symmetry and mott - insulator normal states at half filling for cuprate superconductors .",
    "one immediate conclusion @xcite is that the no - double - occupancy constraint sets an upper limit for the number of doped holes if su(4 ) is to be preserved : @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "thus , the maximum doping fraction consistent with su(4 ) symmetry is @xmath120 beyond this doping fraction the no - double - occupancy condition can not be ensured and exact su(4 ) symmetry can not be preserved .",
    "the empirical maximum doping fraction 0.23 @xmath121 0.27 @xcite for cuprate superconductivity may then be taken as indirect evidence for a strongly - realized su(4 ) symmetry underlying the superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "the soft nature of the so(5 ) phase is seen most clearly if we introduce the su(4 ) coherent states @xcite .",
    "the result of such a coherent state analysis is a set of energy surfaces that represent an approximation to the original theory , in which order parameters appear as independent variables . in the general case",
    ", these energy surfaces can exhibit minima and these minima may appear at non - zero values of the order parameters , implying spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the coherent state method is a well - developed theoretical approach to relating a many - body algebraic theory with no broken symmetry to an approximation of that theory that exhibits spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "this method may be viewed as the extension of glauber coherent state theory @xcite ( which is built on an su(2 ) lie algebra ) to a more complex system having an arbitrary lie algebra structure .",
    "it has also been shown to be equivalent to the most general hatree - fock - bogoliubov variational method under symmetry constraints , and has been applied extensively in various areas of physics and mathematical physics .",

    "the three gaps @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 represent , respectively , the energy scales of the singlet pairing , triplet pairing , and af correlation , and we have introduced an analogous su(4 ) gap @xmath189 to represent the energy scale of the su(4 ) invariant through @xmath190 thus the ground state energy is determined by the four energy gaps ( or energy scales ) @xmath191 where @xmath192 is given by eq .",

    "the essential difference is that conventional pairing theories deal with one pairing gap and one kind of quasiparticles ; here we have two pairing energy gaps and two kinds of interacting quasiparticles , implying a larger variety of possible behavior .",

    "specifically , one finds that for @xmath211 @xmath212 while for @xmath213 ( but this is the ground - state solution only for @xmath209 ) , @xmath214     and the doping is scaled by the maximum doping p@xmath215 .",

    "the diagram is constructed using the analytical expressions ( [ udodsu4 ] , [ udopdq ] , [ udopdd ] , [ odopdq ] , [ odopdd ] ) .",
    "it is generic because the relative size of the gaps can be modified by the choice of interaction strengths but their basic forms are dictated entirely by the algebraic structure of the model .",
    "four energy gaps are predicted :    1 .   the gap @xmath188 measuring antiferromagnetic correlations ( see eq .",
    "( [ udopdq ] ) ) , which has its maximal value at @xmath71 , decreases nearly linearly to the region of the pairing gaps as doping increases , crosses the pairing gaps , and vanishes eventually at the critical doping @xmath216 .",
    "the spin - singlet pairing gap @xmath186 ( see eq .",
    "( [ udopdd ] ) ) , which is the superconducting gap for @xmath220 .",
    "starting from the critical doping @xmath216 , it decreases as the doping decreases .",
    "3 .   the spin - singlet pairing gap @xmath221 ( see eq.([odopdd ] ) ) , which is the superconducting gap for @xmath209 but is not the order parameter for the ground state in the doping range @xmath220 .",

    "the total su(4 ) correlation measured by @xmath189 , which has its doping dependence following eq .",
    "( [ udodsu4 ] ) in the whole doping range .",
    "it is interesting to observe that at the critical doping value @xmath216 the pairing gaps exhibit non - trivial behavior : for @xmath222 , the singlet pairing gap corresponds to a single curve , labeled by @xmath223 .",
    "however , as the doping decreases from @xmath216 , the energy scale @xmath223 splits into two curves ( labeled @xmath186 and @xmath223 ) having very different doping dependence .",
    "the qualitative features of the su(4 ) gap diagram in fig . 4 seem to agree well with many recent observations in cuprates @xcite .",
    "in particular , the appearance of a quantum critical point @xmath216 , the splitting of the pairing gap in the underdoped regime , and the existence of two distinct pseudogaps are basic predictions of the su(4 ) model that have some experimental support .",
    "the occurrence of the doping critical point and the splitting of the pairing gap below the critical point are understood in the su(4 ) model as a direct consequence of the competing pairing and af correlations below @xmath216 . in this picture",
    ", the critical doping point @xmath216 defines a natural boundary between overdoped and underdoped regimes .",
    "it corresponds to the disappearance of af correlations and separates a doping regime characterized by weak superconductivity and reduced pair condensation energy from a doping regime characterized by strong superconductivity and maximal pair condensation energy .",
    "the origin of pseudogaps is one of the unsolved major problems in high-@xmath224 superconductor physics .",
    "the pseudogap is believed to have a profound effect on a wide range of physical properties of cuprates and is generally considered to be intimately connected with the origins of high - temperature superconductivity . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is as yet little consensus about their origin and behavior but many proposed explanations fall into one of two categories : the preformed pair picture @xcite or the competing order picture @xcite .",
    "as we now briefly discuss ( more detail will be published elsewhere @xcite ) , the su(4 ) model predicts , and unifies at the microscopic level , two sources for pseudogap behavior , one of which may be interpreted as arising from preformed pairs and one of which may be interpreted as arising from competing order .",
    "the preformed pair picture @xcite suggests that the pseudogap is the energy that is needed to form pairs as a first step in condensing them into a state with long - range order .",
    "a pseudogap arising in this way would be expected to decrease with increased doping and should merge with the pairing gap in the overdoped region .",
    "the su(4 ) gap @xmath225 has exactly these properties . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ udodsu4 ] ) , @xmath226 depends only on @xmath52 and is independent of @xmath216 .",
    "it is maximal at half - filling and falls to zero at the largest doping .",
    "this gap is related to the su(4 ) invariant @xmath227 ( see eq .",
    "( [ enesu4 ] ) ) , which is state independent .",
    "therefore , the su(4 ) gap is expected to have no temperature dependence , as long as the su(4 ) symmetry is preserved .    on the other hand",
    ", the competing order picture @xcite suggests that the pseudogap is the energy scale for some form of order competing with superconductivity .",
    "a pseudogap originating in competing order should not generally merge with the pairing gap and may fall to zero at a critical doping point where the competing order is completely suppressed relative to the superconducting order .",
    "the su(4 ) antiferromagnetic gap @xmath188 has these properties and gives rise to a pseudogap that may be interpreted in terms of competing af and sc order . specifically , the scale @xmath188 is the energy per electron required to break the af correlation and serves as an order parameter of the af phase .",
    "thus , the su(4 ) model predicts the existence of two distinct pseudogaps .",
    "the seemingly rather contradictory mechanisms for the origin of the pseudogaps as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite may find a consistent explanation in the su(4 ) model .",
    "the su(4 ) symmetry represents a fully microscopic fermion system in which sc and af modes enter on an equal footing . at this `` unification '' level",
    ", there is in a sense no distinction among these degrees of freedom , just as in the standard electroweak theory of elementary particle physics the electromagnetic and weak interactions are unified above the intermediate vector boson mass scale .",
    "we may view the system as having condensed into su(4 ) pairs , which fixes the length of the state vectors ( through the su(4 ) casimir expectation value ) but not their direction in the state - vector space .",
    "physically , this means that the system is paired , with the pair structure exhibiting su(4 ) symmetry , but is neither sc nor af because fluctuations on a scale set by the temperature prevent selection of the sc or af directions . stated in another way , the su(4 ) pairs are of collective strength , but are not condensed into a state with long - range order . stated in",
    "yet another way , neither the af nor sc order parameters have finite expectation values in this regime , but a sum of their squares ( the su(4 ) casimir ) does .",
    "this constraint implies an intimate connection between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the su(4 ) model .",
    "they are , in a sense , different projections of the same fundamental vector in an abstract algebraic space .    compared to the hubbard or _",
    "t - j _ models , the dynamical symmetry approach applied here represents a different way to simplify a strongly - correlated many - body problem . in the hubbard or _",
    "t - j _ models , approximations are made to simplify the hamiltonian but no specific truncation is assumed for the configuration space , although in practical calculations a truncation is typically necessary . in contrast",
    ", we make no approximation to the hamiltonian .",
    "the only approximation is the ( severe ) space truncation .",
    "the symmetry dictated hamiltonian includes _ all _ possible interactions in the truncated space . in principle , if all the degrees of freedom of the system are included , this approach constitutes an exact microscopic theory .",
    "the validity of this approach depends entirely on the validity of the choice of truncated space , which may be tested by comparison with the data .",
    "the advantage of the dynamical symmetry approach is its cleanness and simplicity .",
    "it is clean because the _ only _ approximation is the selection of the truncated model space .",
    "thus , a failure of the method is a strong signal that one has chosen a poor model space .",
    "it is simple because the method supplies analytical solutions for various dynamical symmetry limits as a starting point .",
    "these symmetry - limit solutions provide an immediate handle on the physics and permit an initial judgement of the model s validity without large - scale numerical calculations . beyond the symmetry limits , numerical calculations",
    "may be necessary .",
    "however , because of the low dimensionality of the models spaces and the power of group theory , such numerical calculations are much simpler than those in , say , a hubbard or _",
    "t - j _ model .",
    "simple symmetries as a predictor of dynamics has found powerful application in fields such as particle physics or nuclear physics .",
    "although a real physical system may be very complex , these applications are based on the obvious point that nature has managed to construct a stable ground state having well - defined collective properties that change systematically from compound to compound .",
    "extensive experience in many fields of physics suggests that this is the signal that the phenomenon in question is described by a _ small effective subspace with renormalized interactions _ ( that may differ substantially in form and strength from those of the full space ) and governed by a symmetry structure of manageable dimensionality .",
    "the results described here suggest that the observational complexities of high temperature superconductors may also be described by a simple theory based on dynamical symmetries having these properties .",
