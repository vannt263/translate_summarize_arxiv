    "horizontal differences in density between two fluids lead to the propagation of so - called gravity currents .",
    "these currents are of interest in a number of industrial as well as natural applications and so obtaining an understanding of the way in which they propagate is a subject that has motivated a considerable amount of current research  @xcite .    in previous publications ,",
    "our understanding of axisymmetric viscous gravity currents on an impermeable boundary  @xcite has been generalised to take account of the effects of a slope  @xcite as well as the propagation of a current in a porous medium  @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the propagation of a gravity current from a point source in a porous medium at an impermeable sloping boundary .",
    "of particular interest is the evolution of the current away from the axisymmetric similarity solution found by @xcite .",
    "we begin by deriving the evolution equations for the shape of a current whose volume varies in time like @xmath6 .",
    "a scaling analysis of these governing equations reveals the extent of the current as a function of time up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "the full form of the similarity solutions that give rise to these scalings can only be determined by numerical means , however , and to do so we modify the numerical code of  @xcite .",
    "for some particular values of @xmath7 , it is possible to make analytical progress ; these cases are considered separately and provide a useful check of the numerical scheme .",
    "we then compare the results of the numerical calculations to a series of experiments and find good quantitative agreement between the two .",
    "finally , in the last section , we discuss the implications of our results in geological settings , with particular emphasis on the implications of our work for the sequestration of carbon dioxide .    , propagating in a porous medium saturated with liquid of density @xmath8 above an inclined plane .",
    "( a ) plan view of the current and ( b ) horizontal section through the current .",
    ", height=264 ]",
    "we consider a gravity current consisting of fluid material of density @xmath9 in a deep porous medium saturated with fluid of density @xmath8 , which is bounded by an impermeable barrier at an angle @xmath10 to the horizontal ( see figure  [ setup ] for a sketch of the setup ) . that the saturated porous medium is deep in comparison with the vertical extent of the current allows us to neglect the motion of the surrounding fluid , simplifying the problem considerably .",
    "we use the natural cartesian co - ordinate system centred on the mass source and aligned with the slope of the impermeable boundary .",
    "the depth , @xmath11 , of the gravity current is then determined by continuity combined with darcy s law  ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) and the assumption that the pressure in the current is hydrostatic , i.e. @xmath12 with @xmath13 constant . here",
    ", darcy s law takes the form @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the permeability of the porous medium and @xmath16 is the viscosity of the liquid . the velocity within the porous medium is therefore given by @xmath17 using this along with the conservation of mass ,",
    "we obtain @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the porosity of the porous medium and @xmath20 .",
    "equation is a nonlinear advection  diffusion equation for the current thickness , with the two terms on the right hand side representing the gravity ",
    "driven spreading of the current and its advection downslope , respectively .",
    "it is common to close the system by requiring that the volume of the current depend on time like @xmath21 for some constant @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "this constraint leads to solutions of self - similar form ( as we shall see again in this case ) but also covers the natural cases of a fixed volume release ( @xmath23 ) and a constant flux release ( @xmath24 ) . to impose this volume constraint , ( [ pde ] )",
    "must be solved along with @xmath25 with @xmath26 giving the edge of the current for @xmath27 .",
    "note that contains an extra multiplicative factor of @xmath19 , which was omitted in the study of an axisymmetric current in a porous medium by @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ pde ] ) and ( [ vol_const ] ) may be non - dimensionalized by setting @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the natural velocity scale in the problem . in non  dimensional terms , therefore , the current satisfies @xmath34 along with the volume conservation constraint @xmath35      to aid our physical understanding of the spreading of the gravity current , we begin by considering the scaling behaviour of the spreading in the limits of short and long times . for @xmath1 , shows that at short times ( @xmath36 ) the typical horizontal velocity scale is @xmath37 so that @xmath38 .",
    "further , @xmath39 and volume conservation requires that @xmath40 . from this",
    "we therefore find the axisymmetric scalings obtained by  @xcite , namely @xmath41 at long times ( @xmath42 ) , again for @xmath1 , the typical downslope velocity of the current is @xmath43 while in the across - slope direction we have @xmath44 .",
    "combined with volume conservation @xmath45 these scalings lead to @xmath46 so that the current spreads predominantly downslope .",
    "it is worth noting here that the long time scaling @xmath47 is unsurprising because may be simplified by moving into a frame moving at unit speed downslope  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the scaling @xmath48 is identical to that found by  @xcite for a viscous current on a slope .    when @xmath5 , the importance of the two downslope terms ( the diffusive and translational terms ) reverses .",
    "in particular , at long times @xmath49 , so that we in fact recover the axisymmetric spreading scalings given in as being relevant for @xmath42 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath50 we recover the non - axisymmetric scalings of .",
    "a summary of the different scaling regimes expected is given in dimensional terms in table [ tabl_scale ] .    that we observe axisymmetric spreading if @xmath5 and @xmath42 is surprising , but is a consequence of the fact that the downslope flux in a porous medium gravity current is only weakly dependent on the local height and so can be swamped by the spreading terms in . in the viscous case , this is not possible because the downslope flux is able to remove the incoming flux much more efficiently and penalizes the accumulation of material at a particular point more .",
    ".summary of the asymptotic scalings for the dimensions of a gravity current in a porous medium at an inclined plane .",
    "here dimensional notation is used for clarity , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are as defined in and , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the experimental results plotted in figure  [ gc_res ] shows that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results produced by solving .",
    "the comparison between experimentally observed current profiles and those predicted from theoretical solutions of shown in figure [ profiles ] is also favourable  particularly away from the source region . two possible mechanisms may account for the slight discrepancy between experiments and theory observed :",
    "the drag exerted by the solid substrate on the current and the fact that the pore reynolds number in our experiments is typically @xmath53 .",
    "such a value of the pore reynolds number suggests that we may be approaching the regime where darcy s law begins to break down , which is around @xmath54  @xcite .    , and the maximum horizontal extent of the current , @xmath55 , as functions of time .",
    "the symbols used to represent each experimental run are given in table  [ expt_dets].,width=377 ]",
    "our experimental and numerical analyses have shown that shortly after the initiation of a constant flux gravity current ( @xmath24 ) it begins to spread axisymmetrically in the manner described by  @xcite .",
    "however , at times much longer than the characteristic time @xmath51 given in , the current loses its axisymmetry and propagates predominantly downslope .",
    "since it propagates at constant velocity in this regime , the current propagates much further and faster in this case than would be the case if it remained axisymmetric .",
    "this is potentially problematic in a range of practical applications , such as the sequestration of carbon dioxide in which super - critical carbon dioxide is pumped into aquifers .",
    "since the density of the liquid carbon dioxide lies in the range @xmath56  @xcite , it remains buoyant with respect to the ambient water and so will rise up any inclined boundaries .    the time - scale , @xmath51 , over which asymmetric spreading develops is of interest to those wishing to predict the course of the released current . while it is difficult to evaluate @xmath51 in a precise manner because of the uncertainties in the properties of the surrounding rock , we can perform some estimates on the basis of the available data from the sleipner field  @xcite . in this norwegian field , around @xmath57 of liquid @xmath58 is currently pumped into the local sandstone each year . presumably due to geological complications ,",
    "this single input flux is observed later to separate into around ten independent currents propagating within different horizons of the permeable layer , each of which has a volume flux lying in the region @xmath59 .",
    "combined with typical measured values for the porosity and permeability of @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as the @xmath58 viscosity , @xmath62  @xcite we can estimate upper and lower bounds on the value of @xmath51 . when @xmath63 , we find that @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the effects of non - axisymmetric spreading may indeed be important in the field . because of the variety of values of the slope that we might expect to encounter in any geological setting , we note also that for @xmath65 , @xmath66 . for constant pumping rate ( @xmath24 )",
    ", this gives @xmath67 : i.e.  the precise value of the timescale over which the current becomes asymmetric depends sensitively on @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that the different spreading regimes discussed here may be observed in the field and may also have practical implications .",
    "since injection occurs into confined layers of sediment , estimates for the vertical scale of the current , @xmath68 , are also important .",
    "interestingly , @xmath68 is independent of @xmath10 for @xmath65 ( measured in radians ) and @xmath24 so that , with the parameter values given above , we find @xmath69 .",
    "this suggests that , near the source , the depth of the sediment layer may be similar to that of the current ( and so exchange , confined flows may become significant ) .",
    "however , we expect that the scaling @xmath70 valid away from the source ensures that the present study will remain valid downstream .",
