    "it will be useful to recall the notion of _ finite depth quantum circuit_. a depth-1 quantum circuit is a product of local unitary operators of disjoint support .",

    "the self - referential nature is essential .",
    "the total number of branches would grow exponentially with the coarse - graining level .",
    "the branching structure usually yields very highly entangled states .",
    "for example , in a 1d spin chain , a typical branching mera state with the total number of branches being @xmath141 at coarse - graining level @xmath142 , obeys a `` volume '' law of entanglement entropy . in general , the entanglement entropy of a ball - like region of linear dimension @xmath143 , for a branching mera state in a @xmath144-dimensional lattice scales like @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the total number of branches at rg level @xmath142 .",

    "our bound in eq",
    ".   merely illustrates that the branching mera description of the cubic code model is consistent in view of the entanglement entropy scaling , despite the intuition that the branching mera yields much more entanglement .",
    "rather , the necessity of the branching structure relies on the ground state degeneracy .",
    "if a usual mera description were possible , the ground space of the cubic code model on @xmath138 ( with @xmath147 ) lattice would have a one - to - one correspondence with the hilbert space of @xmath148 qubits in the top level of the mera , and therefore would be of a constant dimension .",
    "this would contradict eq .  .",
    "the finite depth quantum circuits @xmath7 and @xmath18 are complicated and not very enlightening .",
    "explicit circuits and calculation can be found in a mathematica script in supplementary material .",
    "@xcite in this section , we explain a machinary to compute @xmath7 and @xmath18 .",
    "it heavily depends on a special structure of the hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the content here is essentially presented in ref .  , so we will be brief .",
    "the pauli @xmath149 matrices @xmath40 have a special property that ( i ) they square to identity , ( ii ) the product of any pair of the matrices results in the third up to a phase factor @xmath150 , and ( iii ) they anticommute with one another .",
    "in other words , they form an abelian group under multiplication up to the phase factors .",
    "this group , ignoring the phase factors , is just @xmath151 .",
    "a conventional correspondence is given by @xmath152 the correspondence easily generalizes to pauli operators ( tensor products of pauli matrices ) .",
    "an @xmath142-qubit pauli operator corresponds to a bit @xmath153 string of length @xmath154 : the first half of the bit string expresses @xmath155 , while the second half expresses @xmath81 .",
    "if a qubit system admits translations , e.g.  one - dimensional spin chain , the corresponding bit string can be written in a compact way : write the bits in the coefficients of the translation group elements in a formal linear combination .",
    "for example , @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the translation by one unit length to the right .",
    "this is merely a change of notation .",
    "it yields a particularly simple expression for translation - invariant hamiltonians whose terms are pauli operators , because one only has to keep a few polynomials that express different types of local terms .",
    "local terms are expressed not by an infinite laurent series , but by a finite linear combination of the translation group elements .",
    "summarizing , we have introduced a notation for hamiltonians of pauli operators using the translation group algebra with coefficients in @xmath158 .    the cubic code model @xmath0 in eq .",
    "can now be written as @xmath159 where @xmath160 are translations along @xmath161-direction , respectively , and @xmath162 , etc .",
    "since the unit cell of the cubic code model contains two qubits , we need @xmath163 rows in the matrix .",
    "the first row expresses @xmath155 in the first qubit at each site , the second row @xmath155 the second qubit , the third row @xmath81 in the first qubit , and the fourth row @xmath81 in the second qubit .",
    "it is the most convenient to write two matrices in a single matrix where each type of term is written in each column .",
    "@xmath164 we refer to this matrix @xmath165 as a _ generating matrix _ of @xmath0 .",
    "a subclass of finite depth quantum circuits is effectively implemented using this laurent polynomial description .",
    "it consists of unitaries that respect the translation symmetry and map pauli operators to pauli operators .",
    "more specifically , they are compositions of so - called cnot , hadamard , and phase gates . for example , hadamard gate @xmath166 swaps @xmath155 and @xmath81 : @xmath167 if the hadamard is applied for every qubit on the lattice , then the upper half and the lower half of the laurent polynomial matrix will be interchanged .",
    "similarly , one can work out the action of the cnot gate @xmath168 and phase gate @xmath169 on the laurent polynomial matrix .",
    "the result is that they correspond to _ row operations _ on the laurent polynomial matrix .",
    "that is , any elementary row operation @xmath170 , viewed as a left matrix multiplication @xmath171 , is admissible as long as @xmath170 satisfies the symplectic condition @xmath172 where the bar means the antipode map under which @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . here",
    ", @xmath176 is the number of qubits per unit cell .",
    "@xmath177 is the @xmath178 identity matrix . for a proof , see ref .  .",
    "note that when the two - qubit unitary operator cnot above acts within a unit cell , the antipode map is trivial since @xmath170 in eq",
    ".   will not involve any variable @xmath160 , etc ; the antipode map does not do anything to coefficients .",
    "when the cnot acts on a pair of qubits across the unit cells , which is allowed only if the unit cell contains two or more qubits , the antipode map is nontrivial . of course",
    ", in any case , the overall unitary must have the same periodicity with the lattice .    using the above row operations",
    ", one can only generate a finite depth quantum circuit whose periodicity is @xmath179 .",
    "if one wishes to apply , say , hadamard gates on every other qubits ( periodicity 2 ) , one has to choose a subgroup @xmath180 of the original translation group @xmath181 , so that one unit of translation under @xmath180 is the translation by two units under @xmath181 .",
    "then , one can implement the periodicity @xmath182 quantum circuit , using the prescription above .",
    "under such a coarse translation group , our matrix representation of the hamiltonian must be different .",
    "computing a new representation is easy , and a prescription is as follows . if one wishes to take the coarse translation group to be @xmath183 where @xmath184 , one simply replaces each laurent polynomial @xmath185 of @xmath165 with the matrix @xmath186 if the old generating matrix @xmath165 was @xmath187 , then the new generating matrix is @xmath188 .",
    "again , a proof of this claim can be found in ref .  .",
    "let us perform an entanglement rg for the toric code model ( ising gauge theory ) .",
    "@xcite as we call for strict translation - invariance , we take the square lattice with the unit cell at a vertex consisting of one horizontal edge on the east ( 1 ) and one vertical edge on the north ( 2 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath189 following the correspondence eq .",

    "now we apply row operations that satisfy eq .  .",
    "@xmath193 let us recover the hamiltonian .",
    "we have found a finite depth quantum circuit @xmath7 from eq .",
    "such that @xmath194 since the hamiltonian is frustration - free , it is clear that the first and fourth qubits in each unit cell are in a trivial state and are disentangled from the rest . as noted above in sec .",
    "[ sec : erg ] , only the multiplicative group generated by the terms in the hamiltonian is important , and we recover @xmath195 we started with at a coarse - grained lattice @xmath180 .",
    "the example demonstrates that _ any column operation on the generating matrix @xmath165 is allowed _ in view of equivalence eq .  .",
    "this shows that the ground state of the toric code model is a fixed point in an entanglement rg flow .",
    "@xcite    in supplementary material , we perform similar calculations for 3d and 4d toric code models .",
    "( 3d toric code model is also known as 3d ising gauge theory .",

    "our example of the bifurcation is very specific to the cubic code model , and general criteria for the bifurcation to happen are not well understood .",
    "however , we can rule out certain possibilities as follows .",
    "we have found an equivalence by a finite depth quantum circuit between the ground space of @xmath4 , where @xmath1 in the parentheses is the lattice spacing , and that of @xmath196 .",
    "can we find a similar relation between the ground space of @xmath4 and that of , say , @xmath197 for some hamiltonian @xmath91 ?",
    "put differently , how coarse should a new bravais lattice be , if one wishes to find a copy of @xmath0 on the new bravais lattice by a finite depth quantum circuit ?    in this section , we give a _ necessary _",
    "condition for this question to be answered positively by exploiting our laurent polynomial matrix descriptions .",
    "the condition will detect cases when one will not find a copy of the original model one started with on a coarser lattice .",

    ", the upper - left block is described by two polynomials @xmath199 : for the cubic code model , they are @xmath200 and @xmath201 . for the toric code model , they are @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the lower - right blocks in both cases are related to the upper - left blocks by the antipode map , so we can focus only on the upper - left blocks .",

    "but , now we are treating them as unknown variables and furthermore equating the polynomials in those variables with zero !",
    "indeed , it requires good deal of preparation before defining the variety properly , which is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "we will state facts that are useful for our purpose .",
    "interested readers are referred to ref .  .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : egrg - toric - code ] that the generating matrix @xmath165 takes a different form @xmath212 depending on our choice of translation group . upon taking a coarse translation group , the variety",
    "is changed to @xmath213 .",
    "interestingly , one can show that the change is again given by a nice algebraic map .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath214 where @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 in three - dimensional lattice , which means @xmath218 sites are blocked to form a single new site , then the change is given by an almost surjective map @xmath219    the variety @xmath220 for the juxtaposition of two independent systems @xmath221 and @xmath222 as in eq .",
    ", is given by the union @xmath223 of respective varieties .",
    "we have noted that @xmath208 is invariant under local unitary transformations .",
    "the entanglement rg is a combination of local unitary transformations after a choice of a smaller translation group .",
    "hence , if a copy of the original model is to be found in the coarse lattice , _ the new variety @xmath224 must contain the original @xmath208 .",
    "_ this is a criterion by which the bifurcation , or an occurrence of the original model at a coarse lattice _ may _ happen .",
    "it is unknown if the criterion is a sufficient condition .",
    "let us apply the criterion to the toric code model and the cubic code model . as we have seen above , @xmath225 . upon a choice of a coarser lattice , blocking @xmath149 sites as a new one site",
    ", the variety is transformed by the map @xmath226 and @xmath227 . obviously , the point @xmath228 is invariant under this map , which is consistent with the fact that the toric code is a rg fixed point .",

    "the color code model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath241 where the sum is over all hexagons .",
    "this is expressed with pauli matrices and each term commutes with any other , and thus our laurent polynomial matrix description is applicable . since the honeycomb lattice has two vertices in the conventional unit cell ( fig .",

    "the original variety is not contained in the new variety , and therefore one will not find a copy of the original model on the coarse bravais lattice @xmath246 .",
    "on the other hand , if one tried to show the equivalence of the color code model and the toric code model , then one should take the mentioned bravais lattice @xmath246 ; otherwise , the variety of the transformed color code model would not match that of the toric code model , and the equivalence would never be explicit .",
    "we have shown that under the entanglement renormalization group flow the cubic code model bifurcates . the cubic code model",

    "we have further shown that the model @xmath14 bifurcates into two copies of itself .",
    "the bifurcation alone , as seen in phase b , can be observed in a trivial and rather ad hoc example : an infinite stack of toric codes .",
    "we need to be a little formal because the example is too trivial .",
    "let @xmath251 be the hamiltonian of the toric code model on a 2d square lattice with qubits on edges , where lattice spacing is @xmath1 .",

    "then , @xmath260    in contrast , our model can not be written as a stack of lower dimensional systems .",
