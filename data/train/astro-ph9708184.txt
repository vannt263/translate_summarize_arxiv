    "hot subdwarfs are blue , horizontal - branch like stars , representing the late stages of evolution of stars having started with less than about 2.5 m@xmath10  on the main sequence .",
    "the hotter subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars form a well defined group .",
    "their luminosity is of the order of 10 l@xmath10 and their surface temperatures are roughly between 2 10@xmath11 and 3 10@xmath11 k. the age of the sdb stars does not follow from the stellar properties .",
    "the abundance of metals in subdwarf star atmospheres is possibly affected by upward convection of processed material but more likely by gravitational downward diffusion of the heavy elements .",
    "thus the normally low metal abundance seen in sdb stars is not an indicator for their age .",
    "our studies of hot subdwarf stars have two main goals : one is to determine the parameters and the evolutionary state of the subdwarf stars in the framework of stellar evolution ; the other is to investigate the structure of the milky way using these stars . a relation between these two goals",
    "can be found in the connection between the age of subdwarf stars and their spatial distribution .",
    "old stars will more likely be distributed in a thicker disk , due to the heating up of their average kinematics through interactions with other stars .",
    "young stars , on the other hand , are rather moving inside the thin gaseous galactic disk where they originated . still , the present day location of a star is , in general , no indication for its age .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the kinematic behaviour exemplified by the orbit .",
    "the characteristics of the orbits may contain information about the formation epoch and place of the stars , information not accessible through the metal content .",
    "our investigations will show whether the star is in its motion confined in the thin disk of the milky way , or that it may reach to large @xmath2-distances similar to objects of the halo population .",

    "a full use of the internal accuracy of these data will eventually be possible through a rereduction with hipparcos reference stars .",

    ". the better agreement between the catalogues of c+94 and t+97 may be explained by the fact that the local inhomogenities of the ppm catalogue will affect both methods in a similar way .",
    "radial velocities are available for the stars from the spectra in the bonn data base ( see papers cited with table 1 ) .",
    "several of them have already been published , in some cases they have been determined for this paper . for stars from s+94 radial velocities",
    "have been taken from saffer ( 1994 ) .",
    "the radial velocities have accuracies of the order of 30 kms@xmath5 .",
    "for some stars it is known ( see table1 ) that the radial velocities are variable .",
    "this may be a sign for binary nature of the objects ( see , e.g. , theissen et al .",
    "1995 , paper v ) .",
    "however , the physical parameters derived for the selected stars were beyond doubt , so that the distance is reliable .",
    "we have investigated the effect of changes in the radial velocities on the orbits , as described in sect.5.2 , and found them only of minor importance in a statistical sense .",
    "the distances of the stars have been taken from the literature , as indicated with table 1 .",
    "distances are based on the determination of @xmath22  and log@xmath23 , the reddening corrected visual magnitude , and the assumption that the star has a mass of 0.5 m@xmath10 .",

    "( 1997 ; b+97 ) .",
    "in order to calculate orbits a model for the gravitational potential of the milky way has to be adopted .",
    "we have based our study on the model potential by allen & santillan ( 1991 ) .",
    "this model was particularly developed for use in an orbit program and has been applied to the orbits of nearby stars , metal poor stars , as well as globular cluster orbits ( allen & santillan 1991 , 1993 , scholz et al .",
    "1996 , schuster & allen 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative model of the kind which is suitable for numerical orbit integrations would , for instance , be the one of dauphole & colin ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , previous investigations have shown that the results obtained with these different models agree as long as the orbits do not reach extreme distances from the galactic centre ( dauphole et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we used the allen & santillan model as implemented in an updated version of the computer program of odenkirchen & brosche ( 1992 ) . in order to be consistent with the parameters of the model , our calculations of the stellar space velocities",
    "follow the current iau values for the lsr @xmath24 = 220 kms@xmath5  and @xmath25 kpc .",
    "the observational data ( table 1 ) have been transformed into the positional ( @xmath26 ) and velocity ( @xmath27 ) coordinates in the galactic system ( table 3 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath28-axis points from the sun toward the galactic centre with the zero point at the galactic centre .",
    "the orbits were calculated over a total of 1 gyr backwards .",
    "this time span is longer than the sdb evolutionary phase ( assuming they are genuine horizontal - branch like stars ) , but we opted to use 1 gyr to achieve good statistics for the stellar positions ( see sect .",
    "a selection of the orbits is shown in fig.1 . given",
    "are the meridional cuts , showing the motion of the star in projected galactocentric distance @xmath29  and in distance to the plane of the milky way .",
    "the figure demonstrates the variety of orbits found .",
    "the orbits of the stars of our sample are rather well behaved .",
    "most stars stay overall very close to the disk but 10 stars veer out to @xmath30 kpc ( pg 0918 + 029 reaches @xmath31 kpc ) .",
    "many of the stars have orbits reaching way in toward the centre of the milky way ( 7 stars to @xmath32 kpc , the extreme is pg 0133 + 114 to @xmath33 kpc ) . 8 stars move out to @xmath34 kpc .",
    "a most notable result is that the orbits cover large portions of the galaxy ( see also fig.5 ) .",
    "we have attempted to sort the stars according to ` halo'-like and ` disk'-like orbits . when trying to do so one has to consider the formation history of the stellar populations in our galaxy .",
    "the stars of the globular clusters were among the first to be formed in the galaxy ; they are called population ii stars .",
    "relatively recently formed stars , like those of the open clusters , are part of the population i. the very different morphology of the data point distribution in the respective colour - magnitude diagrams led baade to the concept of these two populations .",
    "star formation has most likely been a continuous process in our galaxy .",
    "this must mean that there is , in practice , a population continuum without sharp boundary between these populations , a fact exemplified in phrasings like old population i , old disk population , and the like .    in principle",
    "the sdb stars in the galaxy form a mix of stars of a large age range . stars having started with about 2.5 m@xmath10  evolve in about 0.3 gyr to the horizontal - branch stage , whereas old stars having started as main - sequence star with @xmath35 m@xmath10   take some 12 to 15 gyr to become the sdb star it is today . with a constant star formation rate in the galaxy",
    "we would expect that the sdb stars of today come from the past in proportion to the initial mass function .",
    "so we would expect that sdb star samples are dominated by the older ones .",
    "the kinematics of the formation location may be reflected in the motion of today .",
    "stars having formed in the halo still will have ` halo ' orbits , while stars having formed in the galactic disk are expected to have orbits confined to the disk .",
    "however , dynamically interacting encounters with other stars during the full stellar life time will have had its effect on the kinematics too .",
    "for that reason one may expect that old stars of the disk have heated - up orbits .",
    "# 1#21.0    we have calculated several parameters related to the orbits of the stars ( see table 3 ) .",
    "@xmath36 , the velocity component parallel to the circular galactic rotation ( cylindrical coordinates ) shows a distribution with a maximum centered near the solar 220 kms@xmath5   but with a rather large spread to @xmath37 kms@xmath5  ( see fig.2a ) . for the angular momentum @xmath38",
    "the same holds , with a peak in the distribution at @xmath39 kpc kms@xmath5   in particular spreading to @xmath40 kpc kms@xmath5  ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "statistically one may expect a spread in each orthogonal velocity component of about 30 kms@xmath5 , based on ( on average ) errors in the radial velocity as well as in each component of the proper motion of about 30 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the observed spread in @xmath36 ( and @xmath38 ) is much larger than that and thus it is not due to noise in the input data .",
    "the stars with small @xmath36 ( small @xmath41 ) most likely are the older ones in the sample .",
    "note that the peak @xmath39 kpc kms@xmath5  corresponds to @xmath42 kms@xmath5 , less than the solar value .",
    "another parameter of relevance is the eccentricity of the orbit defined as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the apo- and perigalactic distances of the stars ( as in allen et  al .",
    "the average for our stars is 0.24 but a notable number has @xmath46 ( note that the orbit of the sun has @xmath47 in the above definition ) .",
    "the orbits of stars with small @xmath41 have , of course , large eccentricities ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "the orbits show the effect of diminishing gravitational potential with galactocentric distance : each star moves to larger @xmath2 when at larger @xmath29   than at smaller projected galactocentric distance . in order to properly quantify the maximum height the star reaches outside the disk",
    "we have defined the ` normalised @xmath2-extent ' , @xmath48 .",
    "the value of this parameter for each orbit is given in table 3 .",
    "the average for our sample is 0.16 .",
    "a large value of @xmath3 is an indication for a halo - like orbit .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 are plotted together in fig.2c . in general",
    "one would expect that orbits very different from that of the sun would be those of old stars .",
    "we therefore suspect that the stars with orbits with approximately either @xmath49 kpc kms@xmath5 , or @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , in general be considered to be the older ones .",
    "can we identify individual stars as old ones based on their orbit ?",
    "pg 0918 + 029 reaches to @xmath52 kpc , the largest @xmath2-value in the sample , while pg 1519 + 640 has a very elongated orbit reaching @xmath53 kpc .",
    "these two stars do not have , however , proper motions based on an extragalactic reference . pg 0212 + 148 reaches to @xmath54 kpc ( the @xmath2-extent of this orbit is much more limited than the one given by colin et al .",
    ", essentially due to a more accurate proper motion ) .",
    "pg0142 + 148 has an orbit with @xmath29  covering the range of @xmath55 kpc",
    ". these orbits may be the halo like ones , but none of the stars of our sample exhibits clear halo orbit characteristics .",
    "finally , the average kinematic properties of our sample may also be of relevance for characterising the sdb star population .",
    "we have calculated the mean asymmetric drift which turns out to be @xmath56 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the dispersion in the values of the kinematical parameters is @xmath57 kms@xmath5 , @xmath58 kms@xmath5 , and @xmath59 kms@xmath5 .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the kinematical properties of thick disc stars ( ojha et  al .",
    "1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "we conclude that our sample does not contain stars which can be uniquely identified as old and thus as population ii stars .",
    "either the sample is still too small or over time all orbits have been modified to general disk like orbits .",
    "however , several stars have orbits indicative of larger age , identified in fig .",
    "2b and fig.2c as those whose orbital parameters are very different from the suns orbit parameters .",
    "the orbits found are generally well behaved and there are no orbits indicating chaotic behaviour .",
    "schuster & allen ( 1997 ) have investigated a large sample of metal poor high - velocity stars .",
    "these do show chaotic orbits , but schuster & allen conclude this shows up predominantly in stars whose orbits reach to galactocentric distances @xmath29@xmath60 kpc .",
    "our sdb stars stay all further out .",
    "the schuster & allen star orbits also reach to much larger @xmath2-values than those of our sdb stars .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath36 ( and of @xmath41 ) for our orbits suggest that , as a sample , the sdb stars move in the galaxy not too dissimilar from the lsr .",
    "in fact , the average properties of the orbits are quite different from those of the metal poor high - velocity stars studied by allen et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) and schuster & allen ( 1997 ) .",
    "this difference may be an indication for a difference in origin .",
    "the sdb stars either are not very metal poor and not very old while the metal poor high - velocity stars are much older . however , if those metal poor stars are older than the sdb stars , one wonders where the horizontal - branch like stars emerging from such an old population have gone .",
    "alternatively one could speculate about a completely different origin for the sdb stars ( see e.g. paper v ) .",
    "more stars have to be investigated to clarify these questions .",
    "we have investigated the probability with which one may find a given star at a particular @xmath2-distance .",
    "for that we calculated the orbits with equal time steps of 1 myr .",
    "the statistics of these @xmath2-values gives the frequency @xmath61 to find the star at a given @xmath2 .",
    "examples of such histograms are shown in fig.3 .",
    "# 1#21.0    the frequency @xmath61 has a relative minimum near @xmath62 kpc while their maxima are away from the disk .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "all stars will spend more time in the parts of the orbit away from the centre of the gravitational potential ( where the star is far from the disk and the galactic centre ) with a relatively small space velocity , compared to the larger @xmath2-velocity when the star is nearer to the centre of the gravitational potential .",
    "this means that on average a star spends more time away from the disk than ` in ' the disk .",
    "however , selection effects may play a role ( see sect.4.3.1 ) .      working with a large sample of stars",
    ", we can add the histograms together resulting in the overall probability for such stars .",
    "this statistical distribution in @xmath2 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "in fact , the histogram shows the average spatial distribution of such stars , based on their actual kinematic behaviour .",
    "the overall @xmath2-distribution for the stars is rather smooth .",
    "fitting an exponential to the data one finds a scale height @xmath6= 0.97 kpc , based on the combination of the @xmath63 and the @xmath64 side of the histogram .",
    "the one - sided values are @xmath65=0.85 kpc and @xmath66=1.05 kpc , suggesting that the uncertainty in the derived overall scale height is of the order of 0.10 kpc .",
    "the histogram is not identical to an exponential distribution in @xmath2 ( fig.4c ) .",
    "however , assuming an exponential and determining the slope of ln @xmath61 allows to characterize the distribution with one number , which is of great help for the tests and comparisons to be performed .",
    "one has to note that toward high @xmath2 the distribution becomes biased to the very few stars reaching that far in @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , overlooking all orbits , no star in the present sample reaches further than 6 kpc , while just 3 stars reach distances up to 3 to 6 kpc .",
    "the statistics in this @xmath2-range is therefore one of small numbers and can not reliably be used for further numerical analysis . at the same time we concluded in sect.3.4 ,",
    "that the overall sample contains just very few stars ( if any ) stars going to population ii like @xmath2 .    at small @xmath2",
    "the distribution found ( fig.4 panel b ) clearly differs from an exponential space distribution .",
    "the overall @xmath61 shows a relative minimum near @xmath2 = 0 kpc , i.e. , it is more likely to find such stars at some distance _ away _ from the disk than _ in _ the disk .",
    "this finding has consequences for the concept of scale - height fitting from ` statistically complete samples ' in a given direction , as used in several investigations .",
    "looking back to studies of sdb star scale heights from stellar distances , it is clear that the distribution has to be sampled to well beyond 1 kpc in @xmath2 to avoid problems with the relative minimum in the real spatial distribution .",
    "we have calculated the orbits over 1 gyr , although the phase life of sdb stars is about 10@xmath67 yr . doing the statistics for just that part of the orbit results in a scale height of 0.98 kpc , basically the same as our main value . having used 1 gyr apparently does not influence the scale height .",
    "the scale height derived from @xmath61 is based on all positions in all orbits .",
    "however , the orbits cover large portions of the galactic plane .",
    "as noted in sec.3.3 , the change in galactic potential with projected galactocentric distance @xmath29  leads to a ` thickening ' of the orbit .",
    "we therefore have redone the statistics in three intervals of @xmath29 . for @xmath68 @xmath29@xmath69 kpc",
    "we find @xmath70 kpc , for @xmath71 @xmath29@xmath72 kpc ( the solar vicinity ) we find @xmath73 kpc , for @xmath74 @xmath29@xmath75 kpc we find @xmath76 kpc . we conclude that the value from the full sample using all parts of the orbits is somewhat biased toward the large @xmath29  portions .",
    "the value for the scale height of the sdb stars in the solar vicinity is therefore @xmath77 kpc .    before rushing to conclusions we will test in the next subsection the robustness of the result against variations in the input parameters .",
    "it will be shown that small adjustments in the final value of the scale height are needed .",
    "# 1#21.0        one may be concerned that selection effects have played a role in arriving at our results .",
    "let us consider the ways in which the sample came together .",
    "first , for all stars distances and radial velocities must be available . the selection of the stars ( from the pg ) for the investigations of papers ii .. vii was essentially random on the sky so that no preference for any direction in the galaxy is present .",
    "however , our data taking started generally with the brighter stars .",
    "it means that the stars are on average relatively close by .",
    "but , for each star this proximity is only at the present epoch and we therefore sample these individuals by chance ( see fig.5 ) .    on the other hand , for the pg one has not attempted to survey the low galactic latitude portion of the sky ( since the pg was aimed at finding quasars ) and it does not cover the southern sky . in all , the sample therefore lacks stars in some directions , as visible in fig5 .",
    "it may therefore be possible , that our sample underrepresents stars with orbits staying always very close to the disk ( like that of the sun ; see fig.1 ) .",
    "adding such stars might fill in the relative minimum in @xmath61 at @xmath2=0 kpc .",
    "secondly , good proper motions can be determined for stars which have ample first epoch data . since fields of the old plates are normally not defined in terms of galactic coordinates but based on the equatorial system , the first epoch aspect does not introduce a galactic bias .",
    "this is , e.g. , true for the stars lying in the bordeaux zone of the _ carte du ciel_. yet , the low limiting magnitude of available first epoch plates biases our sample to the brighter and thus nearer ones .",
    "especially , the proper motions of the objects in the list of t+97 are based on the astrographic catalogue which is limited to stars brighter than @xmath78 mag .",
    "therefore , the t+94 list has only the brightest sdb stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the proper motions determined using the poss as first epoch data ( sect.2.1 ) pose in principle not a significant limit in terms of brightness .",
    "the sample of the lick stars is not defined in magnitude range , since k+87 selected stars of all magnitudes being of astrophysical relevance at that time , even as faint as @xmath79 mag .      in order to verify that our results do not depend in a critical way on the input parameters used , we have experimented with the input data for the orbit calculation . as indicated in sec.4.2",
    ", we will assume that the histogram @xmath61 can be represented by an exponential , for easy comparison .",
    "we made 3 kinds of experiments .",
    "@xmath80 dividing the sample in two parts    for the half sample with stars now at @xmath81 the scale height from the total orbits was 1.30 kpc whereas for the stars now being in the interior galactic half the scale height came out at 0.72 kpc .",
    "the average is again @xmath82 kpc , and the difference reflects the difference in scale height in relation with @xmath83@xmath29 .    # 1#21.0    for the half sample with stars now at @xmath84 the full orbits gave the scale height 1.0 kpc , the stars now being at @xmath85 led to a scale height of 1.13 kpc .",
    "@xmath80 variation of radial velocity and proper motion    we added 30 kms@xmath5  to all radial velocities ( being the observational uncertainty ) , repeated the orbit calculation , and made the @xmath2-distribution statistics .",
    "in a second attempt we reduced all radial velocities by 30 kms@xmath5 .",
    "we found from these experiments the values @xmath86 and @xmath87 kpc .",
    "both values are larger than our original one , suggesting that the added error makes the average result less reliable .",
    "the actual @xmath88 gives the smallest scale height .",
    "we also added 5 mas / yr both in @xmath17  and @xmath19  and redid our calculations .",
    "we now found @xmath89 1.04 kpc , within the uncertainty range of our original value .",
    "we conclude that , given the size of the star sample , random errors in the input radial velocities and proper motions do not affect the value of the scale height in an essential way .    as a last test here we calculated the histogram based only on the orbits of the 21 stars which have _ absolute _ proper motions ( from table2 and from k+87 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath90 comes out at 0.84 kpc and the remainder of the star orbits lead to a scale height well above 1 kpc .",
    "possibly the c+94 and t+97 proper motions may be affected by additional systematic errors which lead to an increase in the @xmath2-distance in the orbits . this effect is similar to that of changing the radial velocities .",
    "@xmath80 different distance scale    one of the input parameters is the stellar distance .",
    "distance values have uncertainties of the order of 30% .",
    "we have not varied the input distances but tested the effects of distance errors in the following manner .    in the research on sdb stars a systematic difference exists between values of @xmath22 and log @xmath23 derived by some groups ( saffer et  al .",
    "1994 ) and by our group ( papers ii , iv , vii ) .",
    "this difference leads to different distances for the stars ( factors of 1.5 smaller distances from s+94 are not uncommon ) . in our orbit sample",
    "we have included stars investigated by both groups .",
    "we therefore divided our sample in two , one part using our distances and the other part using distances derived by s+94 .",
    "for both groups the orbits were calculated and the @xmath2-distribution was determined .",
    "for the 32 stars from our data we find @xmath6= 1.07 kpc , while for the 17 stars with saffer et  al .",
    "distances ( there is some overlap ) we find a scale height of 0.76 kpc . changing the distance in a systematic way",
    "does make a difference ( it changes also the tangential velocities ) .",
    "@xmath80 different gravitational potential    the value of the scale height found is , of course , also a function of the nature of the potential model for the galaxy . if a smaller surface mass density is assumed , the vertical force will be smaller and consequently the scale height larger ( see allen & santillan 1991 ) . for the present study we will not explore these possibilities further .",
    "overlooking all the tests , we conclude to the following for the @xmath2-distribution of the sdb stars .",
    "the all - orbit @xmath61 is consistent with an exponential distribution with scale height @xmath6= 0.97 kpc .",
    "this scale height turned out to be biased somewhat to the @xmath2-values of stars reaching to large @xmath29 , because @xmath61 in just the solar vicinity indicates that the base value is to be reduced to @xmath6=0.88 kpc .",
    "subsets of the sample gave essentially the same scale height as the base value of 0.97 kpc , with the just noted exception of the division in inner galactic and outer galactic stars .",
    "variations in the input velocities did not produce dramatic changes in the base value . changing the distance of the stars in a systematic manner ( tested by using the distances from papers ii ,",
    "iv , vii versus those from s+94 ) lead to a difference in scale height of a factor 1.4 . taking the s+94 stars out of our data set means increasing the base value from 0.97 to 1.07 kpc    combining these results from the tests we conclude that the sdb stars scale height @xmath6 is best represented with the value of @xmath91 kpc .",
    "the scale height derived from our orbit data is much larger than the @xmath92 pc derived for the sdb stars by heber ( 1986 ) and in paper ii and iv .",
    "clearly , such studies do not sample sdb stars to large enough distances , or they undersample the number of stars close by .",
    "it is well known that the value of a scale height is largely determined by the extreme points in such a distribution and both ends have a large risk of being unreliable given the small number of stars in those extreme bins .",
    "also , the relative maximum near @xmath9 pc in @xmath61 of fig.4 makes clear that samples over limited distances can by definition not lead to a good characterisation of the true @xmath2-distribution .    in an analysis of the spatial distribution of sdb stars",

    "the analysis of the galactic orbits of 41 stars shows that the frequency distribution of finding these stars at a given @xmath2 can be given by an exponential in @xmath2 with a scale height of 1.0@xmath940.1 kpc .",
    "our results are , as various tests with variations of the input parameters have shown , robust and reliable with the indicated error . that value is in agreement with the notion that sdb stars are part of the older disk population .",
    "the asymmetric drift value supports this conclusion .    since sdb stars most likely are the end product of evolution of stars with mass ranging from 0.8 to at most 3 m@xmath10 , stars of different age are present in the sample .",
    "that evolutionary time from the zero age main - sequence to sdb state ranges from 0.5 gyr to over 12 gyr . in that time",

    "<S> the average eccentricity @xmath1 of the orbits of our sample is 0.24 , the average normalised @xmath2-extent @xmath3 of the orbits is 0.16 , and the asymmetric drift of our sample is @xmath4 kms@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that our sample of sdb stars is part of a population of thick disk stars .    </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis of the orbits shows that the subdwarf stars have a spatial distribution in @xmath2 compatible with an exponential one with a scale height @xmath6 of about 1.0 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> however , since only few stars reach to large @xmath2 the spatial distribution is only well defined to @xmath7 kpc .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution in @xmath2 shows a relative minimum near @xmath8 pc and has maxima near @xmath9 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the smaller probability to find the stars in the disk than away from the disk , as expected for any orbit reaching to larger @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> scale height studies based on limited samples of stars in specified directions can therefore easily be flawed when they do not reach to large enough distances to overcome this aspect of the @xmath2-distribution . </S>"
