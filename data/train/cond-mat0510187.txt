    "a 15-cm focal length lens l focuses this light onto the sample . by moving this lens",

    "however , we wish to stress the universal character of the phenomena related to bubble formation and transport . these effects can occur in many other physical systems with phase transitions , solitons , domain walls and bubbles of one phase inside other phase ,    the bubble can be controlled by the laser .",
    "if after creating the bubble , the light beam is defocused in such a way that its spot size becomes much larger than the radius of the generated bubble , then changes of the bubble radius occur until this radius is again stabilized .",

    "we have investigated generalized nonlinear klein ",
    "gordon equations perturbed by moving inhomogeneous external perturbations .",
    "we have shown that a kink  soliton can be transported by an external wave , provided the shape of the wave and its velocity satisfy certain conditions . for instance , a moving external perturbation @xmath37 , where function @xmath58 possesses a zero @xmath187 such that @xmath188 , can carry a kink  soliton provided its velocity does not exceed certain limit .",
    "figures [ fig : fig1 ] , [ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] show examples of these transporting inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "sinusoidal waves as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] can also be successful in transporting a kink  soliton under certain conditions .",
    "the investigated equations are very general .",
    "besides , the concepts and results that lead to the existence of the reported phenomena are also universal .",
    "so we believe that these phenomena can be observed in many other physical systems .",
    "for instance , the stabilization and transport of bubbles using an external perturbation can occur in other systems undergoing a phase  transition .",
    "so the mentioned bubbles ( or drops ) can be superconducting , ferromagnetic , superfluid , etc",
    ".    on the other hand , the discussed transport of solitons and kink  antikink bubbles can be very important in spin systems , molecular motors , charge ",
    "density waves , ferroelectric materials and josephson junctions . in particular , in long josephson junctions the kink",
    " solitons are fluxons .",
    "these fluxons can be controlled using external currents @xcite which can be very relevant in new communication and computer technologies where the fluxons are used as very stable information units .    moreover , the kinks are examples of topological defects .",
    "many results about the kinks can be generalized to other topological defects as vortices and spiral waves which are being studied intensively in countless systems nowadays @xcite .",
