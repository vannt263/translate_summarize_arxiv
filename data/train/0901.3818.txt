    "supersymmetry is a prime candidate for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among various supersymmetric models",
    "the most extensively studied is the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "another popular supersymmetric model , which may be equally or more attractive compared with the mssm , is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) @xcite since it can solve the @xmath6-problem and alleviate the little hierarchy .",
    "these models will soon be put to the test at the lhc .",
    "thus , their phenomenological study is important and urgent .    although the most convincing evidence of supersymmetry is the detection of sparticle ( sfermions , gauginos or higgsinos ) productions , the indirect probe through detecting the quantum effects of virtual sparticles in some measurable interactions will play a complementary role .",
    "if the sparticles are relatively heavy ( say above a few tev ) and hence can not be directly detected at the lhc , the indirect probe through quantum effects could be important . for this end",
    ", the higgs boson yukawa interactions may play a special role since they can harbor sizable quantum effects of heavy sparticles when the higgs sector is not so heavy ( i.e. @xmath0 is not so large ) .",
    "the dominant quantum effects of sparticles are from the supersymmetric qcd interaction and in the literature the calculations have been performed in the mssm for such supersymmetric qcd effects in the higgs boson yukawa couplings @xcite and the associated higgs production processes at the lhc @xcite . the studies in the decoupling limit with heavy sparticles showed that for a light higgs sector ( @xmath0 is not large ) the supersymmetric qcd can leave over large residual quantum effects in both the decay @xmath7 @xcite and the productions at the lhc @xcite . given the popularity of the nmssm , it is necessary to extend the study to the nmssm .",
    "this is the aim of this work .",
    "in this work we will focus on the supersymmetric qcd effects in the @xmath1 coupling ( @xmath2 is the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson ) and perform a comparative study for the two popular supersymmetric models : the mssm and nmssm .",
    "such a study is interesting for two points :    * the study of the nmssm can accommodate the study of the mssm , and in some limit the nmssm results can reduce to the mssm results .",
    "one can envisage that the supersymmetric residual effects in the mssm can be magnified in the nmssm .",
    "so the future measurements of such effects may be useful in telling the difference of the two models . *",
    "compared with the mssm , the nmssm may predict a different tree - level @xmath1 coupling and different loop contribution . in the nmssm the mass matrix and mixings of the higgs bosons",
    "are enriched and thus the components of the lightest cp - even higgs boson @xmath2 are different from the mssm values .",
    "the residual supersymmetric qcd effects in the nmssm may be larger and more interesting .",
    "note that supersymmetry is a decoupling theory and all low - energy observables will recover their corresponding sm predictions when the mass scale of all supersymmetric particles ( including the masses of sparticles and @xmath0 ) take their heavy limits .",
    "the large residual quantum effects of sparticles in the higgs yukawa couplings happen only in case that sparticles are heavy but @xmath0 is light . if both sparticles and @xmath0 take their heavy limit , the residual effects of supersymmetry do vanish . since so far such a split scenario ( with light higgs bosons and relatively heavy sparticles ) remains possible , we should check its phenomenological consequence .",
    "we start our analysis by recapitulating the basics of the nmssm . in the nmssm",
    "a singlet higgs superfield @xmath8 is introduced and the higgs terms in the superpotential are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the higgs doublet superfields , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dimensionless constants .",
    "note that there is no explicit @xmath6-term and an effective @xmath6-parameter is generated when the scalar component ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath8 develops a vev @xmath15 : @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding soft susy breaking terms are given by @xmath17 so the scalar higgs potential is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coupling constant of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "so we can see that in the limit of vanishing @xmath23 and with the input of the effective @xmath24 , the nmssm can reduce to the mssm .    with the vevs @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the scalar fields are expanded as @xmath27 the mass eigenstates can be obtained by unitary rotations of interaction states , e.g. , for the cp - even neutral mass eigenstates ( @xmath28 ) we have @xmath29 so the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath2 is composed by @xmath30 in the mssm , @xmath2 can be decomposed in the same way except that without the singlet component , @xmath31 is a @xmath32 matrix and can be parameterized in terms of a mixing angle @xmath33 .",
    "the sbottom squared - mass matrix in the nmssm is same as in the mssm with @xmath6 replaced by @xmath24 . in the basis of ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) ,",
    "the squared - mass matrix is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being respectively the isospin and electric charge of the @xmath42-quark , @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the soft breaking masses , and @xmath45 being the soft breaking trilinear coupling .",
    "the sbottom mass eigenstates @xmath46 are obtained by the unitary rotation of the interaction eigenstates : @xmath47 where the unitary matrix @xmath48 parameterized by a mixing angle @xmath49 diagonalizes the mass matrix in eq.([eq : sbottommatrix ] ) .",
    "the coupling of sbottoms with the singlet component @xmath50 of the higgs boson @xmath2 comes from the f - term of the superpotential , given by @xmath51 in terms of the mass eigenstates of sbottoms , the vertex @xmath52 takes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is only for the nmssm ( or equivalently set @xmath55 for the mssm ) , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are present for both models .",

    "in our calculation we use the package nmssmtools @xcite for the mass spectrum and the rotation matrix of the higgs fields ( to get the corresponding mssm results we take the limit of very small values for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath71 , and results are checked by using the package feynhiggs @xcite ) . to study the decoupling limit of susy particles , we assume all the soft breaking mass parameters ( @xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath67,@xmath45 ) and the parameter @xmath24 are degenerate , which are collectively denoted by @xmath72 . then in the mssm the susy parameters are ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , while in the nmssm there are three additional parameters ( @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 ,  @xmath71 ) . in our calculations we scan over these three additional parameters in the ranges @xmath75 note here we did not consider a large @xmath12 or @xmath13 . theoretically , the requirement of perturbativity up to some cut - off scale will set upper bounds on @xmath12 and @xmath13 at weak scale ( if the cut - off scale is chosen to be the gut scale , a stringent bound @xmath76 is obtained @xcite ) .",
    "phenomenologically , a large @xmath12 or @xmath13 will incur stringent constraints from current experiments ( see the last reference in @xcite ) .    before displaying the numerical results",
    ", we make some clarifications regarding to our numerical calculations :    * in our calculations we used the package nmssmtools @xcite which considered the loop corrections ( especially the stop / sbottom loops ) to the effective potential , the masses and mixing angles of the higgs bosons .",
    "these corrections are important and can not be ignored .",
    "* since we used the package nmssmtools in which the higgs mass matrices are diagonalized numerically , we did not use any approximate unitary transformation for our calculation .",
    "* for the b - quark mass @xmath64 , in the package nmssmtools ( and thus in our calculation ) , it is taken as the running mass @xmath77 ( we take @xmath78 ) , which means that the sizable qcd loop effects are taken into account . actually ,",
    "although both the tree - level coupling @xmath79 and the one - loop susy qcd contributions @xmath80 are proportional to @xmath64 and thus very sensitive to the value of @xmath64 , the relative correction effects @xmath81 ( displayed in our numerical results ) are not so sensitive to the value of @xmath64 .",
    "now we present some numerical results . to see the general feature of the corrections , we first switch off the experimental constraints on the parameter space and in figs.[dcp_as ] and [ d_a ] display the resluts of the relative correction effects @xmath82",
    "we see that for a light @xmath0 the susy qcd with a large @xmath72 can leave over sizable effects in the coupling @xmath1 . but",
    "as @xmath0 gets heavy , such residual effects of susy qcd become small in magnitude , showing the decoupling behavior of supersymmetry .",
    "compared with the mssm results , the effects in the nmssm can vary in a much broader region . while the corrections are always negative in the mssm , in the nmssm the corrections can be both negative and positive .",
    ".some sample points in the parameter space of the nmssm , in which the susy qcd loop effects @xmath83 can be of very different size .",
    "the mass parameters are in unit of gev . here",
    "we fixed @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 . with such fixed parameters and @xmath72 varying from 400 gev to 2 tev",
    ", the value of @xmath86 in the mssm varies from 106 gev to 119 gev while the corresponding values of @xmath83 in the mssm are about @xmath87 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table-1 ]    in order to figure out in what areas of the nmssm parameter space the one - loop susy qcd effects on the @xmath88 coupling are sizable , we present a set of sample points in table [ table-1 ] .",
    "we see that for the susy qcd loop effects on the @xmath88 coupling to be sizable in the nmssm , the ratio @xmath89 ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 are respectively the components of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in @xmath2 , as defined in eq.[eq13 ] ) plays the key role for the following reasons . as shown in eq.([eq27 ] ) , @xmath83 is composed of two parts : the counter - term part @xmath63 and the vertex - loop part @xmath62 .",
    "we found that in most of the parameter space allowed by the lep constraints , @xmath63 is negative and dominant in size , which is independent of how @xmath2 is composed of .",
    "whereas , @xmath62 is positive and cancel @xmath94 to some extent .",
    "the size of @xmath62 can be enhanced by the ratio @xmath89 , as shown in eq.([eq24 ] ) . although the ratio @xmath95 can also enhance the size of @xmath62 , its effect is suppressed by the smallness of @xmath96 and @xmath12 in @xmath54 ( in our scan we found that both @xmath12 and @xmath96 are small in order to satisfy the lep constraints encoded in the nmssmtools ) .",
    "therefore , as @xmath89 gets large , @xmath62 becomes more sizable and , due to its cancellation effect , the total correction effects become less sizable .",
    "note that although the value of @xmath86 is below 114 gev for some points , these points can still satisfy the lep constraints encoded in the nmssmtools because the lep bound on the mssm @xmath86 is 92 gev ( see fig.2 in the paper by barger et .",
    "al . in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "by the way , some comprehensive studies on the phenomenology of the nmssm higgs sector ( which may be quite different from the phenomenology of the mssm higgs sector ) have been performed in ref.@xcite , where all the higgs couplings and all the decay modes as well as productions have been intensively studied .    from table [ table-1 ] we see that although @xmath12 is scanned in the range of @xmath97 , only small values of @xmath12 ( @xmath98 in magnitude ) survived the lep constraints encoded in the nmssmtools . as @xmath12 gets large , the mixing between singlet and doublet higgs fields becomes large ( although the mixing is not totally determined by @xmath12 and other parameters are also contributing ) and , consequently , is more constrained by lep experiments @xcite .",
    "such a small @xmath12 , together with other nmssm parameters appearing in the mass matrix of the higgs fields , leads to a small mixing between singlet and doublet higgs fields .",
    "as shown in table [ table-1 ] , the singlet component @xmath96 in @xmath2 is small , which means that the lightest higgs boson @xmath2 is not the singlet - like one and instead it is doublet - dominant ( mssm - like ) . for the @xmath88 coupling with such a mssm - like @xmath2 , the nmssm can still allow for quite different susy qcd effects compared with the mssm predictions .",
    "the reason is that , as discussed above , the susy qcd effects are sensitive to the ratio @xmath89 , which is different in these two models ( even for a small @xmath12 , the nmssm can still allow for different - size components @xmath90 and @xmath91 in @xmath2 because other nmssm parameters are also contributing to the mass matrix and mixings of the higgs fields ) .",
    "when we switch on the comprehensive experimental constraints encoded in the nmssmtools @xcite , we obtain the results of @xmath83 displayed in fig.[con_as ] .",
    "these experimental constraints are comprehensive , including the lep ii searches for the higgs boson , various b - decays and the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon @xmath99 ) .    from fig.[con_as ]",
    "we see that in the special scenario under our consideration ( all soft breaking mass parameters are degenerate ) , @xmath72 is constrained in a certain range .",
    "the range of @xmath100 gev is not allowed by lep experiments , while @xmath101 tev can not explain the muon @xmath99 data ( we require the supersymmetric effects to account for the deviation of @xmath102 at @xmath103 level )",
    ". in the allowed region of the parameter space , the susy qcd corrections to the @xmath1 coupling can still be significant , over @xmath3 in magnitude .",
    "if we switch off the muon @xmath99 constraint ( the hadronic contribution to @xmath104 is not so certain @xcite ) , the allowed parameter space gets much broader , as shown in fig.[con_as ] . in our study",
    "we did not require supersymmetry to explain various plausible evidences of dark matter .",
    "note that the susy contributions to the muon @xmath99 are sensitive to the soft masses in slepton sector and chargino sector , but not dependent on the squark or gluino mass involved in our susy qcd loops .",
    "the stringent constraint from the muon @xmath99 data shown in fig.[con_as ] comes from our simple assumption that all soft masses ( in the squark sector , the slepton sector and the gaugino sector ) are degenerate .",
    "of course , the muon @xmath99 constraint is not necessary ; without such an assumption of degeneracy , the constraint is lifted .    since the susy qcd residual effects can be over @xmath3 for the @xmath1 coupling and thus over @xmath4 for",
    "the ratio of the branching fractions ( susy qcd does not contribute to @xmath105 at one - loop level ) @xmath106 future measurements at the lhc or ilc may unravel such supersymmetric effects .",
    "this ratio @xmath107 is proposed in @xcite as a probe to new physics . to measure this ratio at the lhc , one may count the event numbers of the production of @xmath1 followed respectively by the decay @xmath108 and @xmath105 , and the ratio of these two event - numbers can be a measure of @xmath107 ( the difference of efficiency for @xmath42-tagging and @xmath109-tagging should be taken into account ) .",
    "finally , we make some remarks regarding to our results :    * we only investigated the susy qcd corrections , which is @xmath110 and thus should be the most important among the susy corrections . among the susy electroweak corrections , the higgs - top yukawa corrections , which are @xmath111 , may also be sizable although they are seemingly not as large as the @xmath110 susy qcd corrections . with the consideration of the susy electroweak corrections , our conclusion will remain qualatively unchanged . *",
    "since our main interest is the residual effects of heavy sparticles , we assumed all soft susy - breaking mass parameters are equal to @xmath72 .",
    "this is a very strong simplifying assumption .",
    "if we lift such an assumption and consider the multiple free soft parameters , we will obtain the results which numerically are different to some extent while qualitatively exhibit the same feature , i.e. , the nmssm allows broader corrections than the mssm , because the nmssm parameters can complicate the mass matrix and mixings of higgs fields .",
    "* we should stress again that supersymmetry is a decoupling theory and the large residual quantum effects of sparticles in the higgs yukawa couplings are present only in case of a light @xmath0 .",
    "if both @xmath72 and @xmath0 take their heavy limit , the susy effects will vanish .",
    "such a decoupling behavior is similar in the nmssm and mssm , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "we focused on the susy qcd effects in the @xmath1 coupling and performed a comparative study for the two popular susy models : the mssm and nmssm .",
    "we found that for both models the susy qcd can leave over large residual quantum effects in @xmath1 coupling if the sparticles are relatively heavy ( a few tev ) while the higgs sector is not so heavy ( @xmath0 is not so large ) . compared with the mssm results ,",
    "the nmssm can allow for a much broader region of such residual effects .",
    "since these residual effects can be over @xmath3 in magnitude , future measurements of the @xmath1 coupling may unravel such supersymmetric effects or even distinguish the two models .",
