    "the measurement of production of @xmath0mesons in nucleus  nucleus collisions at cern sps energies is a challenging experimental adventure .",
    "this is due to the short life time and expected low multiplicity of @xmath0mesons which cause the small experimental signal originating from @xmath0 decays to be hidden in the large background composed of combinations of non  signal tracks .",
    "there is , however , increasing interest in results on charm production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( a+a ) collisions which motivates various experimental groups to design upgrades of the existing experiments or to build new experiments , which should allow to measure open charm production in a+a collisions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the first measurement of @xmath0meson production may be even possible using the current set  up of the na49 experiment @xcite .",
    "the paper starts with a summary of physics motivations for charm measurement in a+a collisions at the cern sps ( section 2 ) .",
    "the expected multiplicity of @xmath0mesons in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev is discussed in section 3 .",
    "an estimate of the statistical resolution of @xmath0meson measurement which can be achieved using data of the na49 experiment is given in section 4 .",
    "summary and conclusions ( section 5 ) close the paper .",
    "the main motivation for a broad experimental program in which nucleus  nucleus collisions at high energies are studied is the search for the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "an impressive set of data was collected during the last decades and many unexpected phenomena were discovered @xcite . however , the question whether a transient qgp state is created in the early stage of the collisions is still under vivid discussion . in our opinion",
    "this situation is due to the fact that there is no consensus on which models of high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions should be used to interpret experimental results .",
    "the data are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the hypothesis of qgp creation in a+a collisions at the cern sps if a statistical model of the early stage is used for their interpretation @xcite .",
    "this model is , however , considered a non  orthodox approach to hadronic and nuclear collisions as its basic assumptions can not be derived from the commonly accepted theory of strong interaction , qcd .",
    "its validity is , therefore , more surprising than the conclusions reached within this model concerning qgp creation at the cern sps .    on the other hand",
    "it is difficult to use qcd for the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "problems arise because almost all effects intuitively expected in the case of a transition to qgp are in the domain of so  called soft processes in which experimentally testable strict predictions of qcd are not possible .",
    "attempts to build phenomenological qcd  inspired models of soft processes are not very succesful @xcite .",
    "conclusive interpretation of the data within these models seems to be impossible as one can not estimate the uncertainties introduced by the used approximations .",
    "as a possible solution one tries to identify phenomena sensitive to the early stage in which so  called hard qcd processes are believed to prevail @xcite . in this case one",
    "hopes to obtain testable qcd predictions using perturbative methods .",
    "a well known example is the analysis of @xmath2 production in a+a collisions performed under the assumption that the initial production of @xmath3 pairs is described by pqcd .",
    "however the limits of the applicability of pqcd are theoretically not well defined .",
    "therefore any assumption based on validity of pqcd calculations and used to interpret the data should be tested experimentally . in the case of the @xmath2 example",
    "this test can be done by the measurement of the open charm yield and its comparison to pqcd predictions .    in connection with the above discussion of qcd  based models it is interesting to consider a hypothetical model in which , due to technical problems",
    ", strict experimentally testable predictions can not be obtained .",
    "the model gives approximate predictions , however , the error made due to the approximations is difficult to estimate .",
    "experimental results which are in agreement with the predictions of the model can be treated as a ` proof ' of its validity . on the other hand",
    "any disagreement between the model and the data can be interpreted as due to the used approximations .",
    "therefore the model can not be falsified @xcite before a substantial improvment in its predictive power .",
    "this example illustrates the logical problem which one may encounter discussing the validity of qcd  based models .    in the summarized exciting situation concerning our understanding of strong interactions",
    "the role of the experimental results on open charm production in a+a collisions is unique .",
    "* data on open charm should allow to test limits of applicability of the perturbative qcd methods .",
    "+ it is often assumed that the charm quark is heavy enough for pqcd treatment @xcite .",
    "based on this hypothesis results on @xmath2 production in a+a collisions are interpreted in the so ",
    "called suppression models @xcite , in which the suppression is calculated relative to the @xmath2 yield expected from the pqcd factorization theorem @xcite and data on @xmath2 production in p+p interactions .",
    "it was , however , recently shown that the @xmath2 multiplicity is , in good approximation , proportional to pion multiplicity @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath2 yield shows an @xmath4dependence which is characteristic of soft qcd processes .",
    "this experimental observation motivates the question whether pqcd can be used as a model of charm quark production in hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "* data on open charm should allow to test the validity of a non  orthodox statistical model of the early stage of a+a collisions @xcite .",
    "+ in this model charm quark multiplicity is large enough to justify the use of the thermodynamical approximation .",
    "consequently not only the absolute yield of open charm but also its @xmath4dependence are very different for the statistical and the pqcd  based models .",
    "this section starts with a review of the data on @xmath5 and @xmath6 production in proton  nucleon interactions , which leads to an estimate of the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons , @xmath8 , in nucleon ",
    "nucleon , n+n , interactions at 158 a@xmath1gev .",
    "this result is further used to predict the multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev using four different approaches .",
    "there are six measurements of @xmath0meson production cross section at various collision energies ranging from 200 gev to 800 gev , which allow to estimate the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 in p+n interactions @xcite . in p+p interactions @xmath9",
    "is measured at 360 gev @xcite , 400 gev @xcite and at 800 gev @xcite . at 200 gev @xcite ,",
    "250 gev @xcite and 800 gev @xcite the cross section in p+n interactions is estimated based on measured cross section for p+a interactions assuming that @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "we note here that this assumption is not fully justified by the experimental results @xcite and may lead to an additional systematic error in estimating @xmath9 in p+n interactions .",
    "in addition a symmetry of the @xmath10 distribution of @xmath7 mesons with respect to @xmath11 is assumed for the calculation of the integrated cross section using measurements at @xmath12 . in the case of the measurement at 200 gev @xcite",
    "only results for the sum of all @xmath0mesons are published ; in this case we assume that 50% of them are @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons in p+p and p+n interactions is calculated as a ratio @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the inelastic cross section for p+p interaction at the corresponding energy .",
    "the values of @xmath15 are given in table 1 and plotted as a function of @xmath16 in fig .",
    "1 . the results at @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 gev differ by a factor of about 8 , which suggests a possible large systematic uncertainty of the measurements at low energy not accounted for in the quoted errors . taking this into account we estimate the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 at @xmath19 gev ( @xmath20 gev ) in nucleon ",
    "nucleon interactions by an arithmetic average of the measurements at @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 gev , which gives : @xmath21 a large systematic error up to several times the estimated value should be kept in mind .",
    "we discuss here four approaches which allow to estimate the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 in central pb+pb collisions , @xmath22 , at 158 a@xmath1gev .",
    "it is assumed that the central collisions are selected by accepting only events with a low number of spectator nucleons from the projectile nucleus and that typical trigger conditions of the na49 experiment are used @xcite .",
    "this results in a mean number of participant nucleons , @xmath23 , of about 350 @xcite .    * a*. it was recently observed @xcite that the mean multiplicity of @xmath2 mesons increases proportinally to the mean multiplicity of negatively charged hadrons ( more than 90% @xmath24 mesons ) when p+p , p+a and a+a collisions are considered ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . it may be therefore assumed that a similar dependence on the size of the colliding objects is also valid for @xmath0mesons .",
    "following this assumption a mean multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons can be calculated as : @xmath25 where the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "* b*. it is usually assumed that due to the large mass of the charm quark , production of charm can be calculated using perturbative qcd methods @xcite .",
    "this assumption leads to the expectation that the cross section for charm production increases as @xmath28 for all inelastic a+a collisions and that the mean multiplicity of open charm increases as @xmath29 for central a+a collisions .",
    "thus for central pb+pb collisions we get : @xmath30 this estimate agrees with a previously published prediction for charm production based on pqcd inspired models @xcite .",
    "* c*. the na50 collaboration found recently @xcite that a model based on pqcd can not describe the dimuon invariant mass spectrum between the @xmath31 and @xmath2 peaks in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "the spectrum , however , can be reproduced when the contribution from open charm decays is scaled up by a factor of about 3 .",
    "based on this analysis one may expect that : @xmath32 i.e. it is equal to the multiplicity calculated in * b * multiplied by a factor of 3 .    * d*. the production of entropy and strangeness in a+a collisions at the cern sps can be described by a statistical model which assumes the creation of a quark gluon plasma in the early stage of the collision @xcite .",
    "this fact and the observation that the @xmath2 yield is proportional to the pion yield triggered the hypothesis that also charm production can be described by the same statistical approach .",
    "it was calculated , within this model @xcite , that the mean number of @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks produced in central pb+pb collision at 158 a@xmath1gev is about 17 .",
    "based on p+p data @xcite we assume here that about one third of them hadronize as @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons which gives : @xmath35    we summarize this section by observing that predictions of the mean multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev range from 4.5@xmath110@xmath36 to about 6 showing more than a factor 100 difference between minimum and maximum values .",
    "we consider here the possibility of a measurement of @xmath5 and @xmath6 production in a+a collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev using the current set  up of the na49 experiment at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "we start from an introductory discussion on the means to distinguish @xmath5 decays from combinatorial background and on the calculation of the statistical error on @xmath5 multiplicity .",
    "we continue with a brief summary of the relevant properties of the na49 experiment and finally we present results of a simulation which yields an estimate of the statistical resolution of @xmath7 measurement in central pb+pb collisions using the na49 data .",
    "our analysis is based on the study of the two body decay channels of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons : @xmath37 for which the branching ratio is measured to be ( 3.85 @xmath38 0.09)% @xcite .",
    "the mass and the proper life time of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons are @xmath39 = ( 1864.6 @xmath38 0.5 ) mev / c@xmath40 and @xmath41 = 0.01244 cm , respectively @xcite .",
    "let us consider central pb+pb collision at cern sps energy in which among thousands of produced particles are also @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the @xmath5 mesons decay after a typical flight distance of about 0.1 cm ( @xmath42 ) from the collision point .",
    "there are many decay channels possible , but for the reasons discussed at the end of this paper we consider only decays of a single type , @xmath43 , which happen only in 3.85 % of all cases of @xmath5 decays .    for simplicity of the initial discussion",
    "we assume that an ideal detector is placed around the collision point , i.e. for all charged particles electric charge , mass and momentum vector at a given reference plane are measured",
    ".    for all ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) pairs originating from @xmath5 decays ( signal pairs ) the following conditions have to be approximately ( within experimental resolution ) fulfilled :    1 .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath44 and @xmath45 intersect in a point ( decay point ) which is different from the pb+pb collision point , 2 .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath5 life time in its own c.m.s .",
    "frame is an exponential distribution with a mean value equal to @xmath46 cm , 3 .",
    "energy and momentum conservation laws are fulfilled at the decay point when @xmath5 decay hypothesis is assumed , 4 .",
    "the angular distribution of the decay products in the @xmath5 c.m.s . is isotropic .",
    "conditions 14 can be fulfilled ( within experimental resolution ) by a set of ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) pairs which do not originate from the same @xmath5 decay ( background pairs ) only by chance .",
    "the probability of this happening decreases with increasing experimental resolution .    as a useful example we consider the condition 3 of energy momentum conservation at the decay vertex . for practical reasons one often quantifies deviations from energy momentum conservation , assuming the @xmath5 decay hypothesis , by calculating the invariant mass , @xmath47 , for a pair of negatively and positively charged particles and comparing it to the known mass of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "almost all signal pairs are expected to be distributed in a narrow interval @xmath48 centered around @xmath39 . the @xmath49 distribution for background pairs is significantly broader and it has no characteristic peak structure at @xmath39 .",
    "the smearing of the @xmath49 distribution for signal pairs results from the finite resolution of momentum measurement . with increasing resolution the size of the interval @xmath48 in which almost all signal pairs are included decreases consequently resulting in lower number of accepted background pairs .    in the high resolution limit almost only signal pairs ( and almost no background pairs )",
    "are selected when taking pairs from @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the total number of signal pairs , @xmath50 , in @xmath51 events can be approximated by the measured number of pairs in the @xmath48 interval , @xmath52 .",
    "an estimate of the mean multiplicity of signal pairs is therefore given by @xmath53 and its statistical error can be calculated as @xmath54 assuming a poissonian distribution of pair multiplicity in the interval @xmath48 .    in the limit of poor resolution",
    "the number of background pairs , @xmath55 , in the interval @xmath48 is much larger than the number of signal pairs .",
    "therefore in order to estimate the number of signal pairs , @xmath56 , an estimate of the number of background pairs , @xmath57 is needed : @xmath58 the estimate of @xmath57 is model dependent and therefore it has a systematic error which however will not be discussed here .",
    "various models can be used . as an example",
    "let us mention a mixed event model of the background in which background pairs are constructed by selecting particles from different events .",
    "independent of the model used it is reasonable to assume that the statistical error of @xmath57 can be made much smaller than the statistical error of @xmath52 .",
    "thus the statistical error of @xmath59 can be calculated as @xmath60 assuming poissonian distribution of pair multiplicity in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "we observe that in the limit of high resolution the statistical error of the signal is almost fully defined by the number of signal pairs , whereas in the limit of poor resolution it is defined by the number of background pairs .",
    "one can define the statistical significance of the measurement as the ratio @xmath61 which in the case of the poor resolution limit is given by @xmath62 thus in order to maximize the statistical significance of the result one should select the acceptance ( in the example above the size of the @xmath48 interval ) such that the ratio @xmath63 reaches a maximum .",
    "the na49 experiment @xcite at the cern sps was designed and constructed to search for signals of the quark gluon plasma created at the early stage of nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "basic detectors of the na49 set  up are four time projection chambers ( tpc s ) , which allow for a precise tracking of charged particles .",
    "two medium size tpc s of 3 m@xmath64 gas volume each are located inside of two magnets with up to 1.5 t field strength each .",
    "two large size tpc s of 20 m@xmath64 gas volume each are positioned downstream of the magnets for high precision energy loss measurement and acceptance coverage in the forward direction .",
    "overall the tpc s acceptance coverage amounts to up to 80% of all produced charged particles",
    "( this number depends on the reaction studied and magnetic field",
    " target configuration ) .    the tpc s measure up to 234 space points on tracks of up to 13 m length",
    "this allows a precise determination of sign of electric charge , momentum vector ( @xmath65 ( gev / c)@xmath66 ) and energy loss ( @xmath67% relative resolution ) for all accepted particles .",
    "these measurements yield information on particle mass which results in large acceptance ( limited resolution ) particle identification .",
    "four time  of  flight walls ( @xmath68 60 ps resolution ) complement the particle identification capabilities of the na49 detector .    a typical resolution in reconstruction of the distance between collision point and secondary vertex of a two body decay near the target is of the order of 1 cm and is mainly due to the long extrapolation length needed from the first tpc detector .",
    "in order to estimate the statistical resolution of a @xmath22 measurement in na49 we performed a simulation of signal and background pairs as expected in this experiment for central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev . in the simulation the standard geometry and magnetic field of na49 are assumed @xcite .",
    "we define the geometrical accpetance of the na49 tpc s by the requirement that the particle trajectories cross more than 20 tpc padrows , at least one of which has to be in a tpc located inside the magnetic field .",
    "a parametrization of the momentum resolution as measured by na49 is included in the simulation . concerning particle identification",
    "we consider two extreme cases . in the first one we assume that no information on particle mass is available , whereas ideal particle identification is assumed in the second case .",
    "for the background calculation spectra of charged hadrons produced in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev as measured by na49 @xcite are parametrized in rapidity ( @xmath69 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the signal simulation is done assuming a gaussian ( @xmath71 ) rapidity distribution and an exponential spectrum in transverse mass ( @xmath72 mev ) for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "the total multiplicity of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons of 6 as predicted by the statistical model ( see point 3.2.*d * ) is assumed ( if needed ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show the @xmath73 distribution of @xmath5 mesons for which both decay products are in the geometrical acceptance of the na49 tpc s .    before further presentation of results of the simulation we note that conditions 1 and 2 ( see section 4.1 ) , which require an accurate measurement of the decay vertex , can not be used in the exisiting na49 set  up to distinguish signal from background pairs .",
    "this is due to the poor resolution in the reconstruction of the secondary vertex from two body decays of the order of 1 cm , which is much larger than the typical flight path of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of about 1 mm .",
    "therefore background rejection has to be done using conditions 3 , energy  momentum conservation , and 4 , isotropy of the decay , only .",
    "we quantify these conditions by studing @xmath47 ( or @xmath74 ) distribution and cos@xmath75 distribution , where @xmath75 is the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath76 meson directions calculated in @xmath0meson c.m .",
    "system .",
    "the results of the simulation shown below are obtained for the @xmath5 decay , without using information on particle mass .",
    "an improvement of the statistical resolution of charm measurement due to the addition of @xmath6 decays and particle mass information is considered at the end of this section .    in fig .",
    "4 we show an invariant mass distribution @xmath77 for background pairs obtained using the geometrical acceptance of na49 . it is seen that the @xmath5 meson mass is located in the region of the monotonically decreasing tail of the distribution , well beyond the position of its maximum . the @xmath77 distributions for signal and background pairs in the interval of @xmath49 around @xmath39",
    "are shown in figs . 5a and 5c , respectively . for pairs from the interval @xmath48 = 4 mev",
    "/ c@xmath40 around @xmath39 we plot also the cos@xmath75 distributions in figs . 5b and 5d .",
    "we observe that in the case of @xmath5 measurement by na49 we are in the poor resolution limit i.e. the statistical resolution of signal measurement is determined by the number of background pairs and is independent of the signal multiplicity .",
    "it is also clear that rejection of pairs with high cos@xmath75 values should result in an improvement of statistical significance of the signal measurement .",
    "we estimate that the maximum significance can be achieved by accepting pairs with cos@xmath78 and inside an interval of @xmath79 4 mev / c@xmath40 ( background cuts ) .",
    "the mean multiplicity of background pairs for this selection is @xmath80 where the subscript @xmath81 is used to underline that the number is obtained without using information on particle identification .",
    "this yields an estimate of the statistical resolution of @xmath59 @xmath82    the resulting correction factors needed to obtain @xmath83 from the estimated signal multiplicity @xmath59 in the acceptance are :    * @xmath84 = 26.0 , for the branching ratio , * @xmath85 = 2.4 , for the geometrical accepatnce , * @xmath84 = 2.3 , for the background cuts .",
    "therefore the statistical resolution of @xmath83 can be estimated as : @xmath86 in the case of ideal particle identification background multiplicity can be reduced by about a factor of 10 , which results in @xmath87 . therefore for @xmath88 central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev @xmath89 0.41.3 in comparison to @xmath90 expected in the case of the statistical model .",
    "statistical significance of measurement of @xmath8 is approximately by a factor of @xmath91 better than significance of separate measurements for @xmath5 or @xmath6 .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot @xmath92 and @xmath93 as a function of the number of central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev registered by na49 .",
    "the different predictions concerning @xmath94 discussed in section 3 are also indicated in fig . 6 for comparison .    finally in fig .",
    "7 we show @xmath47 distributions obtained using the cos@xmath75 cut for signal and background pairs for 100 central pb+pb collisions . in this case",
    "the number of generated @xmath5 decays was scaled up by a factor of 100 and therefore the statistical significance of the observed signal peak corresponds to the significance expected for @xmath88 events .",
    "the experiment na49 registered up to now about 10@xmath95 central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev .",
    "as follows from the results of simulation presented in fig .",
    "5 already the analysis of this data should yield significant results concerning open charm production in pb+pb collisions .",
    "this encouraging conclusion is reached mainly due to three factors :    * there are expectations of a significant enhancement of open charm production in a+a collisions , * a significant fraction of produced @xmath0mesons is covered by the large geometrical acceptance of na49 , * the good momentum resolution of na49 allows for a significant reduction of background even without reconstructing the @xmath0meson decay vertex .",
    "the results presented in this paper are obtained by a simple analysis of simulated data .",
    "this scheme was selected in order to underline the main concepts and to build intuition concerning basic ingredients of the problem of @xmath0meson measurement in a+a collisions .",
    "the use of more sophisticated statistical methods of data analysis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which e.g. include explicitly the statistical errors of the measured momentum vector by using a kinematical fit , may lead to an improvement of the achieved resolution .",
    "we studied also the statistical resolution of open charm measurement using three and four body decays of neutral and charged @xmath0mesons .",
    "we found that due to high combinatorial background the statistical resolution is much lower than in the case of the two body decay channel .",
    "the main results presented in this paper can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the measurement of open charm production in a+a collisions gives a unique possibility to test predictions of thermodynamical and pqcd  based approaches in the region where both are formally applicable . * various approaches used to estimate the @xmath0meson multiplicity in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev give predictions which differ by more than a factor 100 .",
    "* experimental data already registered by na49 should allow to obtain a significant result on open charm production in pb+pb collisions .",
    "the analysis can yield the first observation of open charm signal or it will lead to an estimate of the upper limit of open charm multiplicity which should significantly narrow the range of allowed models .",
    "it is obvious that a significant increase of statistics of a+a collisions at maximum sps energy registered by na49 is required for continuation of open charm program .",
    "this can be achieved during the already scheduled heavy ion run at the cern sps in the year 2000 and the possible runs beyond .",
    "it is also clear that for a precise measurement of open charm production an upgrade of the na49 set  up by a vertex detector , which allows for an accurate reconstruction of @xmath0meson decay vertices , is needed .                                                                * table 1 * the results on mean multiplicity of @xmath7 mesons produced in p+p and p+n interactions .",
    "the multiplicty for p+n interactions was estimated from the data on p+a interactions ( used reactions are listed in the third column ) assuming that cross section for @xmath0meson production is proportional to @xmath4 . for detailed discussion of the data",
