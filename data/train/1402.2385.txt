    "in this paper we considered a quintessence model of dark energy which interact with generalized cosmic chaplygin gas .",
    "indeed we suggested the two - component universe as a theoretical model .",
    "for the quintessence scalar field we assumed two separate possibility of potential and study both cases under interaction with generalized cosmic chaplygin gas . an interesting assumption , which given in this paper , is consideration of variable @xmath15 in eos parameter of generalized cosmic chaplygin gas .",
    "we assumed it depend on scalar field .",
    "our results obtained by using numerical analysis which give us behavior of some cosmological parameters such as hubble expansion parameter , deceleration parameter , eos and scalar field .",
    "we confirmed that both cases of scalar potential have similar cosmological behavior .",
    "both cases have decreasing hubble expansion parameter of time , and yield to -1 eos parameter which predicted by for example @xmath0cdm model .",
    "therefore , we can propose both cases as a toy model of our universe which agree with current observational data which tells @xmath42 .",
    "this paper may easily extend to modified cosmic chaplygin gas [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] .",

    "<S> this fact makes possibility to huge number of speculations , with different class of outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> one of the outcomes is a possibility of the future singularities , which makes us really afraid . from the one hand we have singularities at the beginning of our universe and from the other hand we have other singularities at the end . for future singularities we have theoretical framework to distinguish them from each other , and theoretically with some certainty to suppose possible origin of them . </S>",
    "<S> however , singularities of the beginning in the history are not distinguishable ( so far we know ) </S>",
    "<S> . we account them as a one single concept . among different contradictory facts </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that cosmologists created to different groups believing to different facts , but careful investigation of the origin of the believes , we can find the same believe seated at the base with different formulations . </S>",
    "<S> recall , that a set of observational data reveal that an expansion of our universe is accelerated [ 1 - 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , the density of matter is very much less than critical density [ 4 ] , the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical . </S>",
    "<S> explanation of accelerated expansion of our universe in modern cosmology is based on an idea of dark energy . among different viewpoints concerning to the nature of the dark component of the universe </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to mention a scalar field models , one of them is tachyonic field with its relativistic lagrangian , @xmath1 which captured a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> the stress energy tensor , @xmath2 gives the energy density and pressure as , @xmath3 and , @xmath4 a quintessence field ( which is under our consideration in this work ) is other model based on scalar field with standard kinetic term , which minimally coupled to gravity . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the action has a wrong sign kinetic term and the scalar field is called phantom . </S>",
    "<S> combination of the quintessence and the phantom is known as the quintom model . </S>",
    "<S> extension of kinetic term in lagrangian yields to a more general frame work on field theoretic dark energy , which is called k - essense . a singular limit of k - essense is called cuscuton model . </S>",
    "<S> this model has an infinite propagating speed for linear perturbations , however causality is still valid . </S>",
    "<S> the most general form for a scalar field with second order equation of motion is the galileon field which also could behaves as dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> see refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5 - 11 ] for several models of dark energy . + an interesting model of dark energy is based on chaplygin gas ( cg ) equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the cg was not consistent with observational data and extended to generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) [ 12 - 14 ] , and indeed proposed unification of dark matter and dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to study viscosity in gcg [ 15 - 20 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , observational data ruled out such a proposal and , gcg extends to the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) [ 21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently , viscous mcg is also suggested and investigated [ 22 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one of the last extensions of cg models is generalized cosmic chaplygin gas ( gccg ) which has been proposed recently [ 23 ] . </S>",
    "<S> + in this work we will consider two models of quintessence scalar field interacting with generalized cosmic chaplygin gas . </S>",
    "<S> for both models we assumed that potential of the field is given . </S>",
    "<S> for the first model , @xmath5 second interacting model will be described by the following potential , @xmath6 for a given quintessence scalar field with a potential @xmath7 we can associate energy density and pressure of an ideal fluid as , @xmath8 and , @xmath9 with the following eos parameter , @xmath10 interaction between components is assumed to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a deceleration parameter , @xmath13 is the energy density of generalized cosmic chaplygin gas and eos of it is written as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 assumed as a function of potential @xmath7 , @xmath16 it is indeed an interesting idea because the coefficient @xmath15 already considered as a constant or a scale - factor dependent coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the paper organized as follow : in next section we will introduce the equations which governs our model . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we give numerical analysis and discuss about cosmological parameters in two different models of given potential . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters are the usual azimuthal and polar angles of spherical coordinates , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the coordinates ( @xmath27 ) are called co - moving coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> + energy conservation @xmath28 reads as , @xmath29 to introduce an interaction between components ( [ eq : bianchi eq ] ) we should mathematically split it into two following equations @xmath30 and , @xmath31 cosmological parameters of our interest are eos parameters of each fluid components @xmath32 , eos parameter of composed fluid , @xmath33 deceleration parameter @xmath12 , which can be written as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which is nested at the base of modern theoretical cosmology </S>",
    "<S> . such assumption gives us possibility to account only non minimal couplings , simplifies calculations . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of an interaction between components in the form of @xmath37 is a speculative job . </S>",
    "<S> the number of the forms of @xmath37 therefore could accept infinite number , even observations could not help us to fix them with a hope to decrease number . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , new observations support to the possibility to increase different possibilities to increase the number of different possible forms of @xmath37 . </S>",
