    "the emergence of complex dynamical behaviors from simple local interactions between pairs of agents in a group is a widespread phenomenon over a range of application domains .",
    "many striking examples can be found in biological systems , from the microscopic ( e.g. , aggregates of bacterial cells or the collective motion of skin cells in wound healing ) @xcite to large - scale aggregates of fish , birds , and even humans @xcite .",
    "these systems are particularly interesting to the robotics community because they allow simple individual agents to achieve complex tasks in ways that are scalable , extensible , and robust to failures of individual agents . in addition , these aggregate behaviors are able to form and persist in spite of complicating factors such as communication delay and restrictions on the number of neighbors each agent is able to interact with , heterogeneity in agent dynamics , and environmental noise .",
    "these factors , and their effects on swarm behaviors , are the focus of our current work .    a number of studies show that even with simple interaction protocols , swarms of agents are able to converge to organized , coherent behaviors .",
    "existing literature on the subject provides a wide selection of both agent - based @xcite and continuum models @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest agent - based models of swarming is reynolds s _ boids _",
    "@xcite , which simulates the motion of a group of flocking birds .",
    "the boids follow three simple rules : collision avoidance , alignment with neighbors , and attraction to neighbors .",
    "since the publication of reynolds s paper , many models based on `` zones '' of attraction , repulsion , and/or alignment have been used as a means of realistically modeling swarming behaviors @xcite .",
    "systematic numerical studies of discrete flocking based on alignment with nearest neighbors were carried out by vicsek _",
    "stochastic interactions between agents are modeled in @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "improved computer vision algorithms have allowed researchers to record and analyze the motions of individual agents in biological flocks , and formulating more accurate , empirical models for collective motion strategies of flocking species including birds and fish @xcite .    despite the multitude of available models ,",
    "how group motion properties emerge from individual agent behaviors is still an active area of research .",
    "for example , @xcite presents a simulation - based analysis of the different kinds of motion in a fish - schooling model ; the authors map phase transitions between different aggregate behaviors as a function of group size and maximum number of neighbors that influence the motion of each fish . in @xcite",
    ", the authors use simulation to study transitions in aggregate motions of prey in response to a predator attack .",
    "interaction delay is a ubiquitous problem in both naturally - occurring and artificial systems , including blood cell production and coordinated flight of bats @xcite .",
    "communication delay can cause emergence of new collective motion patterns and lead to noise - induced switching between bistable patterns @xcite ; this , in turn , can lead to instability in robotic swarming systems @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the effects of delay is key to understanding many swarm behaviors in natural , as well as engineered , systems .",
    "in addition , many models make the mathematically simple but physically implausible assumption that swarms are globally coupled ( that is , each agent is influenced by the motion of all other agents in the swarm ) @xcite .",
    "global coupling is easier to analyze and a reasonable assumption in cases of high - bandwidth communication , with a sufficiently small number of agents .",
    "in contrast , we are interested in the collective motion patterns that emerge when global communication can not be achieved .",
    "new behaviors can unexpectedly emerge when the communication structure of a network is altered , as in @xcite , where the stability of solutions for compromise dynamics over an erds - renyi communication network is considered .",
    "however , in our system , we show robustness of emergent motion patterns to loss of communication links in presence of delayed coupling .    a third effect we consider is agent heterogeneity .",
    "most existing work assumes that the members of the swarm are identical .",
    "however , many practical applications involve swarms that are composed of agents with differing dynamical properties from the onset , or that become different over time due to malfunction or aging .",
    "swarm heterogeneity leads to interesting new collective dynamics such as spontaneous segregation of the various populations within the swarm ; it also has the potential to erode swarm cohesion . in biology , for example , it has been shown that sorting behavior of different cell types during the development of an organism can be achieved simply by introducing heterogeneity in inter - cell adhesion properties @xcite . in robotic systems , allowing for heterogeneity in dynamical behaviors of swarm agents gives greater flexibility in system design , and is therefore desirable not only from a theoretical but also from a practical point of view .",
    "a number of existing works on the spatio - temporal patterns of swarm dynamics present results that are valid in the thermodynamic limit , where the number of agents is assumed to be very large @xcite .",
    "we follow this mean - field approach to analytically predict transitions between regimes of different collective swarm motions , as a function of model parameters , for swarms with random communication graphs , under communication delay and agent heterogeneity .",
    "we also run extensive numerical simulations to test the limits of the thermodynamic model , by limiting the number of agents in the swarm .",
    "extremely large experiments with distributed communication architecture are difficult to run either in the lab or field",
    ". the complex logistical issues of deploying a swarm of even fifty autonomous fixed - wing aircraft are clearly seen in @xcite .",
    "however , most experimental work on multi - robot cooperative motion uses much smaller groups @xcite ( a notable exception is @xcite , which uses a centralized controller to overcome the logistical issues involved with coordinating a very large group of agents ) .",
    "we consider a generalized model of delay - coupled agents given in @xcite .",
    "we show , through a combination of theory , simulation , and experiment , that the collective motion patterns observed in the globally - coupled system in the presence of delayed communication @xcite persist as the degree of the communication network decreases , though some characteristics of the motion patterns are altered .",
    "consider a swarm of delay - coupled agents in @xmath0 .",
    "we assume @xmath1 in the remainder of this paper , but our results may be generalized in a straightforward way for higher dimensions .",
    "each agent is indexed by @xmath2 .",
    "we use a simple but general model for swarming motion .",
    "each agent has a self - propulsion force that strives to maintain motion at a preferred speed and a coupling force that governs its interaction with other agents in the swarm .",
    "the interaction force is defined as the negative gradient of a pairwise interaction potential @xmath3 .",
    "all agents follow the same rules of motion ; however , mechanical differences between agents may lead to heterogeneous dynamics ; this effect is captured by assigning different acceleration factors ( denoted @xmath4 ) to the agents .",
    "agent - to - agent interactions occur along a graph @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the set of vertexes @xmath7 in the graph and @xmath8 is the set of edges @xmath9 .",
    "the vertexes correspond to individual swarm agents , and edges represent communication links ; that is , agents @xmath10 and @xmath11 communicate with each other if and only if @xmath12 .",
    "all communications links are assumed to be bidirectional , and all communications occur with a time delay @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the set of neighbors of agent @xmath10 .",
    "unlike in @xcite , we consider both heterogeneity in the agent accelerations and distributed coupling in the interagent communication network .",
    "the motion of agent @xmath10 is governed by the following equation : @xmath15 where superscript @xmath13 is used to denote time delay , so that @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the euclidean norm , and @xmath18 denotes the gradient with respect to the first argument of @xmath19 . the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : agenti ] governs self - propulsion .",
    "we use mean - field dynamics in the limit as @xmath20 to examine dynamical pattern formation in the aggregate system and describe a bifurcation diagram showing transitions between different motion patterns as we vary model parameters .",
    "we use a harmonic interaction potential with short - range repulsion @xmath21 the harmonic potential was introduced in @xcite and @xcite to model interactions between agents .",
    "this choice can be justified empirically to some extent by noting that , for example , @xcite measures a harmonic interaction in golden shiner fish , with an added short - range repulsion . in the model",
    ", the repulsion force acts over a characteristic distance determined by @xmath22 . for @xmath23 and @xmath22 sufficiently small",
    ", the repulsion force can be treated as a small perturbation of the harmonic interaction potential .",
    "while we derive analytical results under the assumption @xmath24 , our numerical studies indicate that the collective dynamics of the swarm are not significantly altered by the introduction of short - range weak repulsion terms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the communication network for the swarm is a fixed erds - renyi random graph constructed at the beginning of the simulation and invariant in time .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the system analytically in the limit where @xmath25 is almost complete ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of neighbors of node @xmath10 ) , and show via simulations that the approximations made in the almost - complete limit hold closely even as the mean coupling degree is reduced to less than @xmath28 of possible links , for an erds - renyi communication network .",
    "we also show how varying network degree and heterogeneity in the agent dynamics affects the bifurcation structure of the swarm motion patterns , and present numerical simulation to verify that our theoretical results give a good approximation to the true swarm dynamics even as the number of agents in reduced to as few as twenty .",
    "we start our analysis of the system dynamics by considering the mean - field motion , in the limit as @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the position of the center of mass of the swarm . then , applying the change of variables @xmath30 and substituting in eq .",
    "[ eq : u ] for @xmath19 , eq .  [ eq : agenti ] can be written as @xmath31 the motion of the center of mass can be found by summing the above equations over all @xmath10 and dividing by @xmath32 ; after simplifying , we have : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average over @xmath10 and @xmath35 is the dot product in @xmath36 .",
    "our previous work shows that in many instances either individual deviations from the center of mass are small , or in aggregate they tend to cancel out over the whole population @xcite ( we discuss situations in which this assumption breaks in a later section ) .",
    "then , neglecting all terms of order @xmath37 and in the limit @xmath20 , the center of mass motion is given approximately by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the weighted , normalized mean degree of a node for @xmath20 , given by @xmath40    note , in the current paper we do not assume correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath41 so that @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",

    "[ eq : ddeltar ] and [ eq : ddotr ] .",
    "note , however , that these equations are not all independent since , from the definition of @xmath44 , it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "quite remarkably , simulation results indicate that the system exhibits similar collective motions to the globally coupled , homogeneous case , even as the variance of @xmath4 is significantly varied or as @xmath39 is significantly decreased .",
    "these collective motions include `` translation '' , where the entire swarm as a group travels along a straight - line trajectory at constant speed ; `` ring '' motion , where the swarm agents form concentric counter - rotating rings about the stationary center of mass ; and `` rotating '' motion , where the agents collapse to a small volume and collectively rotate about a fixed point .",
    "the collective motions of the swarm and the effects of non - global coupling and heterogeneity are described in more detail in the following sections .",
    "the quasi - stable motion patterns of the swarm depend on values of the coupling coefficient @xmath46 and the delay @xmath13 , similar to the globally coupled , homogeneous case @xcite ; in addition , there is now a dependence on @xmath4 and on the fraction of missing links in @xmath25 .",

    "as shown in the figure , agents with higher acceleration factor / higher coupling have a higher radius and more positive phase offset from the swarm center of mass than those with lower acceleration factor / lower coupling .",
    "the effects of acceleration and coupling degree on the agents in rotation state are similar , since both factors appear in @xmath84 ; we note however that variation in in the acceleration factor has a much smaller effect on the ratio @xmath99 and phase offset @xmath94 than does breaking connections in the communication network .",
    "the foregoing analysis was primarily focused on the limit of agents where @xmath43 .",
    "however , real networks have finite numbers of agents ; in fact , few experimental studies involve more than a few individual agents . to explore the effectiveness of the infinite population approximation",
    ", we conducted numerical experiments using the equations of motion for various swarm sizes while employing all - to - all coupling .",
    "we considered a complete graph @xmath117 rather than an erds - renyi network because we wish to isolate the effects of @xmath32 from those of incomplete connectivity .",

    "using numerical simulations , we measured two quantities : a ) time required to converge to the ring state , and b ) the radius of the ring state .",
    "both quantities were measured at various population sizes , ranging from @xmath119 to @xmath120 although we only show results up to @xmath121 to focus on the small @xmath32 regime .",
    "we considered the system to be in the ring state once the swarm s mean radius to its center of mass had converged to a value @xmath122 , although possibly with small fluctuations in time about it .",

    "the effects for small @xmath32 in this case are similar to that of homogeneous agents ; note that the radius is expected to be larger since @xmath131 resulting in a greater mean radius .",
    "when @xmath32 is very small ( less than 10 ) , a wealth of new patterns emerge with what numerical simulations suggest to be large basins of attraction .",
    "for example , when @xmath132 the most prevalent state arranged all five agents equally along a circle in a pentagonal pattern , rotating in the same direction .",
