    "[ sec : intro ] although the production dynamics of photons and of jets are both individually well understood theoretically , their interplay is not .",
    "hadronic jets are initiated by the production of quarks and gluons which subsequently fragment into clusters of hadrons . in events where a photon is produced in addition to the jets ,",
    "this photon can have two possible origins : the _ direct _ radiation of a photon off a primary quark and the _ fragmentation _ of a hadronic jet into a photon carrying a sizeable fraction of the jet energy .",
    "while the former direct process can be calculated within the framework of the standard model , the latter is described by the process - independent quark - to - photon and gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions @xcite , which can not be calculated using perturbative methods but have to be determined from experimental data .",
    "directly emitted photons are usually well separated from all hadron jets produced in a particular event , while photons originating from fragmentation processes are primarily to be found inside hadronic jets .",
    "consequently , by imposing some isolation criterion on the photon , one is in principle able to suppress ( but not to eliminate ) the fragmentation contribution to final state photon cross sections , and thus to define _ isolated _ photons .",
    "however , recent analyses of the production of isolated photons in electron - positron and proton - antiproton collisions have shown that the application of a geometrical isolation cone surrounding the photon does not lead to a reasonable agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental data .",
    "this discrepancy has important consequences .",
    "data on high @xmath6 photon production are commonly used to extract informations on the gluon distribution in the proton @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the understanding of final state photon radiation in proton - proton collisions is even more crucial for searches for the two photon decay mode of the higgs boson at the lhc @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to study final state photons produced in a hadronic environment is obtained by applying the so - called democratic clustering procedure @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the photon is treated like any other hadron and is clustered simultaneously with the other hadrons into jets .",
    "consequently , one of the jets in the final state contains a photon and is labelled ` photon jet ' if the fraction of electromagnetic energy within the jet is sufficiently large , @xmath7 with @xmath8 determined by the experimental conditions .",
    "this photon is called _ isolated _ if it carries more than a certain fraction , typically 95% , of the jet energy and said to be non - isolated otherwise .",
    "note that this separation is made by studying the experimental @xmath9 distribution and is usually such that hadronisation effects , which tend to reduce @xmath9 , are minimized .",
    "the cross section for the production of isolated photons defined in this approach thus receives sizeable contributions from both direct photon and fragmentation processes .    up to now , this democratic procedure has only been applied by the aleph collaboration at cern in an analysis of two jet events in electron - positron annihilation in which one of the jets contains a highly energetic photon @xcite . in this analysis , aleph made a leading order determination of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function by comparing the photon +  1 jet rate calculated up to @xmath10 @xcite with the data .",
    "then , by inserting their measurement into an @xmath11 calculation of the ` isolated ' photon +  2 and 3 jet rates , they found good agreement for a wide range of values of the jet resolution parameter @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 ` isolated ' photon +  1 jet rate agreed well with the aleph data .",
    "this is remarkable , since with the use of an isolation criterion based on the application of a geometrical cone previously considered @xcite , the agreement between data and theory for this rate was poor and only improved at the expense of large negative radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the size and sign of these corrections was due to the exclusion of soft gluons from the cone containing the photon @xcite .",
    "recently , we have presented a next - to - leading order determination of the quark to photon fragmentation function @xcite based on an @xmath11 calculation of the photon +  1 jet rate and the aleph data .",
    "both theoretical and experimental analyses were performed using a democratic clustering approach ; in particular both analyses used the durham jet recombination algorithm @xcite .",
    "not only is the agreement with the ` isolated ' photon +  1 jet rate improved , but the higher order corrections obtained in this approach were found to be moderate , demonstrating the perturbative stability of this particular photon definition . in this paper , we describe the calculation in more detail . in particular , we extend the commonly used phase space slicing technique @xcite developed to isolate the divergences when one of the final state particles is unresolved to situations where two particles are unresolved .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : njet ] we discuss the general structure of photon + @xmath12  jet events in electron - positron collisions , with particular emphasis on where the singularities arise and how they are absorbed into the photon fragmentation functions . in this fixed order approach , it is critical that the power counting of the various contributions is correct .",
    "one consequence is that the commonly held view @xcite that the quark - to - photon fragmentation function is @xmath13 is untenable .",
    "the particular features of the photon +  1 jet rate are discussed in section  [ sec:1jet ] .",
    "we adopt the resolved parton philosophy of @xcite and introduce a small parameter @xmath14 to separate the final state phase space into resolved and unresolved regions and to isolate the singularities lying in the unresolved regions . within this approach",
    ", it is vital that the various singular regions precisely match onto each other .",
    "the evaluation of the associated different divergent contributions to the photon +  1 jet rate is presented in sections  [ sec : single][sec : frag ] .",
    "fully resolved and single unresolved contributions from the four parton process @xmath15 are described in section  [ sec : single ] while the double unresolved contributions that arise when , for example , three particles are simultaneously collinear are analytically evaluated in section  [ sec : double ] .",
    "contributions from the one - loop process with collinear final state partons are presented in section  [ sec : virt ] and the fragmentation contribution is presented in section  [ sec : frag ] .",
    "all divergent contributions are combined in section  [ sec : total ] , where we explicitly show that after factorization of collinear singularities , no divergences remain . although the individual contributions are finite , they do depend on the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , the physical cross section can not depend on @xmath14 , and in section  [ sec : ymin ] we numerically show that , provided @xmath14 is taken small enough , this is indeed the case .",
    "we combine our numerical results with the experimental data in section  [ sec : results ] and determine the next - to - leading order quark - to - photon fragmentation function for two values of @xmath16 .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "[ sec : njet ] let us first consider the general structure of the @xmath17 jet + photon cross section , fully differential in all quantities , @xmath18 there are two contributions , first the ` prompt ' photon production where the photon is produced directly in the hard interaction and second , the longer distance fragmentation process where one of the partons fragments into a photon and transfers a fraction of the parent momentum to the photon .",
    "each type of parton , @xmath19 , contributes according to the process independent parton - to - photon fragmentation functions @xmath20 and the sum runs over all partons . note that although the fragmentation functions are non - perturbative , we can nominally assign a power of coupling constants , based on counting the couplings necessary to radiate a photon . since the photon couples directly to the quark , @xmath21 is naively of @xmath10 while the gluon can only couple to the photon via a quark and we might expect that @xmath22 is of @xmath11 . this simplistic argument is supported by models of the fragmentation function @xcite which suggest that gluon fragmentation is a much smaller effect than quark fragmentation .",

    "the theoretical cross section can be matched onto the specific experimental details . at this order each parton",

    "although the physical cross section is finite , individual contributions are divergent . in @xmath43 , there are infrared singularities arising from configurations where one of the partons is theoretically ` unresolved ' .",
    "for example , the virtual graphs contain singularities due to soft gluons or collinear partons while similar divergences occur in the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the correct treatment of infrared divergences is well known @xcite and has been discussed widely in the literature .",

    "[ sec : conc ] in this paper we have presented a complete @xmath1 calculation of the photon +  1 jet rate in @xmath0 annihilation . athough this calculation is formally only next - to - leading order in perturbation theory , it contains several ingredients appropriate to next - to - next - to - leading order calculations of jet observables .",
