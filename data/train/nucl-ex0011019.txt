    "the incident proton interacts with one target nucleon leaving the third nucleon as a spectator .",
    "thus , both reactions are dominated by the underlying two elementary reactions @xmath6 on the other hand , the struck nucleon is bound in the deuteron and its momentum distribution will strongly influence the reaction since the presently chosen lowest beam momentum of 750 mev / c is still below the pion threshold in nucleon  nucleon interactions .",
    "the model of the underlying elementary reactions [ pp ] and [ np ] goes back to ruderman @xcite .",
    "although many groups have theoretically studied the two reactions along this path , only moderate success has been achieved .",
    "the various approaches differ in the treatment of the bound state wave functions , additional interactions , distortions , inclusion of the deuteron d - state and so on .",
    "an excellent overview of the theoretical work is given by canton et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "studies of pion production on the nucleon as well as on light nuclei induced by protons have been shown to be dominated by excitation of the p - wave @xmath7 isobar .",
    "only very close to threshold one is sensitive to the interesting pion s - wave @xcite . while for the elementary reactions [ pp ] and [ np ]",
    ", no interference between these two waves can occur because of the symmetry in the entrance channel , reactions [ pd - trit ] and [ pd - he ] show very strong forward ",
    "backward asymmetry containing information on the phases .",
    "the @xmath8 models are therefore especially successful in the resonance region where the interference is small compared to the p - wave contribution .",
    "germond and wilkin @xcite showed that for collinear kinematics only two independent amplitudes exist .",
    "these were fitted to forward and backward scattering angles , to differential cross section data and to deuteron tensor analyzing powers @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref . @xcite",
    "that close to threshold the energy dependence of these two amplitudes is represented by a linear expansion in terms of @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the emission angle in the centre of mass system .",
    "however , when this model with the fitted parameters is extended to higher energies , it can neither describe the total cross sections nor the differential cross sections at forward and backward angles .",
    "the situation for the total cross section is shown in fig .",

    "pickar et al .",
    "@xcite extracted total cross sections from the forward and backward differential cross sections of kerboul et al . @xcite by making additional use of some systematics .",
    "these data are omitted here since they are much larger than direct measurements .",
    "the near  threshold data with @xmath12 are reproduced by the germond -wilkin model .",
    "the data in the resonance region follow the scaled @xmath13 cross section .",
    "clearly , in the intermediate region where the s ",
    "wave interference effects are expected to be large , data are missing .",
    "we , therefore , performed measurements for reaction [ pd - he ] in that interval . in these experiments , also the production of @xmath14 ( reaction [ pd - trit ] ) was measured simultaneously .",
    "a comparison of reactions [ pd - trit ] and [ pd - he ] permits the study of isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the beam energy was chosen to be below the @xmath15 resonance in order to avoid problems due to different resonance masses .",
    "on the other hand , the momentum seems to be sufficiently large to minimize coulomb effects in the exit channel .",
    "isospin symmetry is known to be only an approximate symmetry .",
    "in addition to static breaking due to coulomb effects , the dynamic effects due to the mass differences between the up and down quark are expected to contribute @xcite .",
    "isospin symmetry predicts a value of 2.0 for the ratio of the cross sections .",
    "there have been several studies in the literature of the ratio @xmath16 for the same beam momentum . however , it is not clear whether this is the proper quantity to study isospin symmetry conservation because of the different pion masses and mass differences between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the great advantage of the present work compared to measurements with constant pion centre of mass momentum @xmath19 is that a simultaneous measurement avoids a lot of systematical errors .",
    "this principal advantage is lost when the detector does not allow simultaneous measurements as in ref.s @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these studies are restricted to only a few ( up to 4 ) angles .",
    "all previous results for @xmath20 are larger than 2 .",
    "the two reactions were also measured almost over the full angular range by the same group with the same apparatus at 500 mev , however at different time @xcite .",
    "we found from these measurements an integral ratio @xmath21 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the authors never drew conclusions about charge independence from the cross section data but studied analyzing powers .",
    "khler @xcite studied the ratio @xmath22 in the framework of the ruderman approach @xcite and found the ratio of the form factors to be the dominant source of deviation from 2 .",
    "we have measured reactions [ pd - trit ] and [ pd - he ] simultaneously employing a detector with large momentum and geometrical acceptance for both heavy recoiling nuclei at the same time .",
    "proton beams with momenta of 750 mev / c , 800 mev / c , and 850 mev / c were extracted from the cosy accelerator and focussed onto a target cell containing liquid deuterium .",
    "it had a diameter of 6 mm and a thickness of 6.4 mm @xcite with windows of 1.5 @xmath23 m mylar .",
    "the excellent ratio of deuterium to heavier nuclei in the window material reduced empty target events to a negligible level in contrast to all previous studies .",
    "the beam intensity was measured by different monitor counter arrangements being individually calibrated for each setting of the accelerator .",
    "the calibration was done by measuring the number of scattered particles in the monitor counters as a function of the beam particles .",
    "the latter were measured with the trigger hodoscope in the focal plane of the magnet spectrograph .",
    "this number is of course much larger and leads to dead time in the hodoscope .",
    "the beam intensity was then reduced by debunching the beam between the ion source and the cyclotron injector . for sufficiently small beam intensity , the relation between monitors and hodoscope is linear .",
    "because of the chosen geometry , the counting rate in the monitor counters was small , thus avoiding errors due to pile up .",

    "m_agnetic spectrograph @xcite at cosy . here",
    "we give only some additional details specific for this experiment.the germanium wall consisted of three high purity germanium detectors with radial symmetry with respect to the beam axis as shown in figure [ germaniumwall ] .    the first detector ( called quirl - detector )",
    "measures the position and the energy loss of the penetrating particles .",
    "the active area of this diode is divided on both sides by 200 grooves .",
    "each groove is shaped as an archimedes spiral covering an angular range of @xmath24 with opposite directions on the front and rear side , respectively .",
    "the energy - detectors are mainly used for measuring the energy loss of the penetrating particles or the total kinetic energy of stopped particles , respectively .",
    "these detectors are divided into 32 wedges to reduce the counting rate per division leading to a higher maximum total counting rate of the total detector .",
    "[ delta_e ] shows the response of the germanium wall for reaction particles from the interaction of 850 mev / c protons with deuterons .",

    "the latter two ions are produced in the two reactions of present interest @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "protons and deuterons are from elastic scattering and from @xmath26 reactions .",
    "the faint areas for protons and deuterons are due to the situation where one particle with higher energy generates a trigger for a low energy particle falling below the discriminator thresholds .",
    "the information deduced from the germanium wall are energy , emission vertex and particle type .",
    "they were converted to a four momentum vector .",
    "these measurements together with the knowledge of the four momenta in the initial state yield the missing mass of the unobserved pion by applying conservation of momentum , energy , charge and baryon number .    in the off - line analysis ,",
    "soft gates were applied to the triton and @xmath18 loci in fig .",

    "[ missing_mass ] .",
    "the data are shown as histograms .",
    "the good peak to background ratio is obvious as well as the excellent statistics .",
    "the peak in the case of @xmath25 emission is broader than for @xmath27 emission .",
    "this is due to the larger energy straggeling in the target of the double charged particle compared to the one for single charged particle . in the final analysis this effect is corrected .",
    "the data could be fitted by a second order polynomial for the background and a gaussian with variable width for the peak . in order to remove this background , spectra of observables not depending on the emission angle",
    "were analyzed .",
    "for @xmath25 the @xmath28 curve was linearized and projected to the @xmath29-axis . for @xmath27",
    "the centre of mass momentum was used .",
    "the resulting spectra show a peak on a smooth background . in a second step ,",
    "the background was fitted by smooth functions and subtracted for each bin in @xmath30 .",
    "the efficiency of the analysis procedures were studied by monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "for @xmath25 particles being stopped in the quirl detector , the kinematical relation between emission angle and energy was applied .",
    "unfortunately , this was only possible for the runs at 750 mev / c and 800 mev / c , while in the runs at 850 mev / c a hardware coincidence between the quirl and the first energy detector was required .",
    "tritons being emitted under zero degree in the laboratory system with the smallest energy were detected in the magnetic spectrometer applying hardware and software cuts as reported in ref .",
    "finally , the data were corrected for reduced efficiencies due to nuclear absorption in the detector material @xcite .",

    "all data are from the measurements with the germanium wall except the triton zero degree measurement corresponding to @xmath31 in the centre of mass system .",
    "these points were obtained with the help of the magnetic spectrograph . because of the small acceptance left over for this device by the hole in the germanium wall the count rate was rather small .",
    "an additional uncertainty is due to the size of the acceptance which may result from a slightly inclined beam together with the rather thick target and a beam having widths of @xmath32 mm and @xmath33 mm .",
    "we assume this additional uncertainty to be 20@xmath34 and add it to the count rate error in quadrature .",
    "for @xmath25 emission at smaller energies for the 750 mev / c and 800 mev / c beam momenta the analysis was based on the almost linear relation between kinetic energy and emission angle for the two body reaction , as mentioned above .",
    "this method leads to a larger background than in case of coincidence measurements esp .",
    "due to the triton events with not too different kinematics .",
    "therefore , the statistical error bars are much larger for these data which are shown as squares in fig.s [ cross_section_750 ] and [ cross_section_800 ] .",

    "ions with slightly larger energy can fall below thresholds in the trigger electronics or the adc .",
    "this effect leads to a reduction of counting rate for larger emission angles and to an increased counting rate in a similar interval below these angles due to the smaller energy deposit of these ions in the quirl detector .",
    "( in principle a hole should appear but this is smeared out due to the longitudinal straggling . )",
    "we have studied this effect with monte carlo calculations and found that differential cross sections can be different up to @xmath37 .",
    "the data are finally corrected for this effect .",
    "the shown error bars include the statistical uncertainty as well as the systematic one from background subtraction .",
    "this is larger in the case of tritium emission than for @xmath25 emission while the pure statistical uncertainty behaves opposite .",
    "the cross sections for both reactions show a backward peaking of the @xmath38 nuclei which corresponds to a forward peaking of the pion .",
    "the angular distribution for the smallest beam momentum shows an exponential decrease with increasing @xmath39 . for the larger beam momenta",
    "an additional component at forward angles shows up which seems to be less angle dependent .",
    "also shown in fig.s [ cross_section_750 ] , [ cross_section_800 ] , and [ cross_section_850 ] are model calculations which will be discussed further down . only the statistical errors are shown .",
    "in addition , there are systematic uncertainties due to target thickness ( 5% ) , luminosity calibration ( 7% ) and detector response and analysis method ( 3% ) .",
    "only the last contribution is different for the two reactions .",
    "the same is true for the energy loss corrections in the target .",
    "this leads to a total systematic error of up to 9.1@xmath34 .",

    "also an exponential with a constant could account for the data , however with much larger uncertainties .",
    "this may have its origin in the different number of fitted parameters .",
    "the total cross section is obtained by integrating the fitted angular distributions over the full solid angle . due to the ambiguity in the order of the legendre polynomial and the corrections applied to the data close to the detector acceptance limit a systematic uncertainty shows up . in case of the @xmath25 emission",
    "the backward angle range causes some errors .",
    "for the two lower beam momenta the different method of measurement without coincidence compared to the forward emitted particles introduced larger error bars and a specific structure as is discussed above .",
    "the influence of this structure on the total cross section is estimated by simulations . as a result , a systematic error in addition to the fit error shows up . for 850 mev / c no such data exist because of the coincidence requirement in the hardware trigger .",

    "are obtained by linear interpolating the angular distributions for the neighbouring @xmath73 and @xmath58-values , respectively .",
    "the principal advantage of cancellation of systematical errors is lost in part by doing so and the linear interpolation may introduce another systematical error in the percent range .",
    "the results are @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the ratios for the two reactions obtained for constant @xmath58-values are shown in fig .",

    "this procedure yields for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and for @xmath81 , a ratio @xmath82 . in all cases",
    "we have corrected the @xmath83 data for the coulomb effects by the usual gamow factor being 2 to 3% depending on the momentum .",
    "all three methods lead to a weighted mean value close to two .",
    "however , it is not clear on which level one should compare .",
    "in addition , trivial effects due to different pion masses or pion or beam momenta remain .",
    "we may , therefore , compare matrix elements instead of differential cross sections .",
    "they are calculated according to @xmath84 for a reaction @xmath85 . in eq .",
    "[ matrix ] @xmath86 denotes the spins , @xmath87 the momenta of the initial and final state in the c. m. system , @xmath88 the total energies and @xmath89 the total energy squared .",

    "[ matrix ] is the relativistic formulation of the well known non - relativistic result ( see eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that the correction is smallest ( less than 1% ) for constant @xmath73 .",
    "it is always the measurement at 850 mev / c which has a ratio much smaller than 2 .",
    "the influence of this measurement on the results for constant @xmath73 or constant @xmath58 is small .",
    "if one neglects this one ratio , the mean values are @xmath100 , @xmath77 and @xmath101 for constant @xmath89 , @xmath73 and @xmath58 , respectively . which criterion is the best is not clear .",
    "the latter two methods suffer from different measurements and the interpolation procedure resulting in some systematic error being at least of the order of the statistical error .",

    "the matrix elements for the lowest beam momentum show an almost exponential dependence on the four  momentum transfer squared . for the highest momentum , an additional component for large ",
    "momentum transfer shows up , the same as the differential cross sections .",
    "the data definitely show a dependence on the beam momenta .",
    "this is in contrast to the conjecture by silverman et al .",
    "@xcite that the invariant matrix element squared is independent of the beam energy which , by the way , is not supported by any theory .",
    "the y - axis for each beam momentum are adjusted to each other for the two reactions by a factor of two , in order to get an estimate of the validity of isospin symmetry .",
    "there is a common tendency in the data : the matrix element for the @xmath102 reaction is smaller than the isospin corrected one for the @xmath103 reaction for small momentum transfer and larger for large momentum transfer .",
    "this behaviour becomes more pronounced with increasing beam momentum .",
    "this may have its origin in different slopes for different @xmath89 and @xmath104 , the data decrease with increasing pion momentum .",
    "this leads to a t - dependence of the ratio @xmath105 for data obtained at the same beam momentum .",
    "the ratios , not coulomb corrected , show an decrease with increasing momentum transfer which may have its origin in different kinematics .",
    "the ratio for 850 mev / c is flat for high momentum transfers and in this region much smaller than two .",
    "whether these effects result from interferences with coulomb effects or are due to increasing importance of @xmath106 resonance excitation with increasing bombarding energy needs further studies .",
    "in summary , we have measured simultaneously the two reactions @xmath74 and @xmath107 in the intermediate region between the near threshold and the resonance range . a liquid deuterium target with very thin walls reduced empty  target corrections to a negligible level . by the present method problems due to normalization to beam current , target thicknesses , solid angle , dead time corrections etc .",
    "are avoided .",
    "it is the first time that the ratio of the two reactions is studied over a large angular range .",
    "the differential cross sections as well as the total cross sections for the @xmath107 reaction bridge the previous gap between data in the threshold region and the resonance region . however , for the @xmath74 reaction , a discrepancy with data for the time ",
    "reversed reaction shows up .",
    "this was already mentioned by aniol et al .",
    "@xcite and may have its origin in the differences between initial and final  states due to coulomb effects in the two reactions .",
    "it is found that models based on the input of @xmath108 cross sections or amplitudes yield total cross sections for the @xmath57 reactions which are close to @xmath108 cross sections scaled down by factors of 80 and 160 for the @xmath109 reaction and @xmath107 reaction , respectively .",
    "since these data follow a different energy dependence than the present data , the calculations do the same .",
    "the enhancement of the calculated differential cross sections for large momentum transfer is not supported by the present data .",
    "it seems that none of the models discussed above is able to account for the experimental data over a large energy range on an absolute base .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the s - wave model of locher and weber @xcite agrees best with the data in a range where the d - wave in the deuteron contributes most strongly .",
    "the deduced isospin ratio of @xmath110 up to @xmath111 for the differential cross sections is smaller than the one found by silverman et al .",
    "@xcite of @xmath112",
    ". the measured ratio of the matrix elements squared for the two lower beam momenta of @xmath100 is in agreement with the result @xmath113 obtained by harting et al .",
    "@xcite at a beam energy of 591 mev",
    ". at this energy the differences in the kinematics are expected to be small .",
    "khler @xcite estimated that , if the effect of the coulomb force in the @xmath18 wavefunction is reduced , the ratio changes from 2 to @xmath114 for 600 mev .",
    "introducing such an additional correction leaves almost no room for isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "such calculations for different beam momenta and with modern wavefunctions will be helpful in answering the question on the sensitivity of isospin symmetry breaking in the present two reactions .",
    "further measurements will improve the present error bars .",
