    "transition events with long timescales are of great importance in many fields of molecular science . in particular , examples in biology range from conformational changes in proteins associated with ligand binding @xcite to allosteric transitions that occur throughout the global protein domain @xcite .",
    "their typical timescales are the order of @xmath0-@xmath1 sec @xcite .",
    "such rare transition events are due to the separation between the initial and final configurations in phase space .",
    "the separation is caused by the existence of a high energy barrier or a narrow gate in a potential energy surface ; schematic examples of such separations are shown in fig .",

    "schematic examples of the separations in the potential energy surface .",
    "( a ) a high energy barrier or ( b ) a narrow gate separate the initial and final configurations represented by the circle and cross , respectively .",
    "the thin lines denote the contours of the potential energy surfaces . ]",
    "numerical simulation is an essential tool to elucidate the rare transition event and obtain the final configuration .",
    "there exist two kinds of approaches to the problem .",
    "the first one is to find a pathway determined only by the geometrical feature of the potential energy together with some criteria .",
    "the second one is to obtain a trajectory which respects both the potential energy and the kinetic energy . in this work ,",
    "we employ the latter one because the rare transition events are generated by the potential and kinetic effects .",
    "a standard method for the latter one is molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "however , the computational time requirement of conventional md makes this method insufficient for simulation of these rare transition events .",
    "a number of efficient methods that use artificial forces to overcome high energy barriers have been proposed @xcite .",
    "most of the previous methods , however , are not efficient for rare transition events caused by a narrow gate .",
    "this is because the transition rate through the narrow gate is determined by a frequency factor and has a weak ( at most power - law ) dependence on the magnitude of the artificial forces as shown in chemical kinetics .",
    "both the high energy barrier and the narrow gate are of significance for rare transition events especially in biology @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the development of a method to simulate rare transition events caused by not only the high energy barrier but also the narrow gate ; we are interested in transitions between local minima in a potential energy surface .",
    "typical thermally fluctuating motions are confined in space near the initial configuration ; the motions have complex multi - dimensional structures .",
    "on the other hand , the motion in the rare transition event moves along a simple sharp curve for the following reasons .",
    "for the narrow gate , coordinates of the system are limited to specific values as a result of the narrowness of the potential energy surface .",
    "for the high energy barrier , the coordinates must obtain large momenta to overcome the barrier , and the momenta restrict the direction of motion to a specific one . from this discussion , the method to be developed is one that can separate one relevant coordinate , which parametrizes the curve , from other coordinates orthogonal to the relevant one .",
    "we call the coordinate a _ collective coordinate _ and the curve a _ collective path_. many construction methods for the collective path have been proposed over the past five or more decades @xcite .",
    "this approach includes both the potential energy and the kinetic energy as we shall see in [ sec:007 ] .    the self - consistent theory of large - amplitude collective motion developed by dang _",
    "@xcite is one of the powerful methods , which is a pioneering work in applications to molecular systems .",
    "central to their theory are _ decoupling conditions _ given by four equations whose solution gives the collective path .",
    "because exact decoupling is not anticipated for realistic systems , that is , the four equations can not have a simultaneous solution in general , the problem becomes that of defining a constructive procedure for the approximate collective path .",
    "@xcite , two approximations based on a subset of the four equations have been proposed .    however , which approximations in the theory of dang _",
    "give a transition event between local minima in a potential energy surface depends highly on the details of the potential parameters , as will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec:002 - 3 ] . owing to the lack of the robustness in the previous works , defining a unique approximation to the decoupling conditions and a method for evaluating the quality of it is a central issue for development of the collective path theory .    a natural improvement of the approximations proposed by dang _",
    "is a construction of the collective path as an optimal solution to all the four decoupling condition equations rather than a subset of them . to manipulate this approximation and evaluate the quality of the resultant collective path",
    ", we introduce a unique scalar quantity that measures the deviations from the equalities in the four decoupling condition equations .",
    "we then minimize this quantity to formulate the proper construction method of the collective path .",
    "the resultant method is based on a first - order differential equation whose solubility algorithm requires calculation of the first and second derivatives of the potential energy at each step for a stepwise construction of the collective path .",
    "we show this method can robustly construct the collective path even if the initial and final configurations are separated by a high energy barrier or narrow gate as shown in fig .",
