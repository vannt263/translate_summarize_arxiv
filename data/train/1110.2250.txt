    "spatial distribution of dust in protoplanetary discs is measured from disc continuum spectra in near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths whereas the gas density is measured directly by line emission from such as co and indirectly from h@xmath0 emission which is used for estimations of accretion rates of gas onto central stars .",
    "infrared excess due to dust emission disappears in 3 myr for roughly a half of discs and for almost all discs in 10 myr @xcite .",
    "gas in inner discs disappears in similar time - scales @xcite , but the life time of gas in outer discs is not clearly known .",
    "recent observations , such by the spitzer infrared space - telescope , the submillimeter array , and the subaru telescope , revealed discs in the dispersal phase , so - called transition discs @xcite .",
    "they have optically thick outer discs whereas inner discs with sizes up to @xmath1 70 au are optically thin .",
    "this indicates depletion of dust in the inner discs .",
    "some of transition discs show near - infrared excess indicating formation of gaps instead of holes and some others have weaker mid to far infrared emission indicating optically thinner outer discs @xcite .",
    "the fraction of transition discs in protoplanetary discs increases with time @xcite : 15 - 20 per cent at 1 - 2 myr and more than 50 per cent at 5 - 8 myr .",
    "a puzzling thing is that a large fraction ( 75 per cent ; @xcite ) of transition discs exhibit gas accretion onto their central stars and their accretion rates are close to those for classical t tauri stars , @xmath2 @xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there are three proposed explanations for the origin of transition discs but all of them do not seem to be fully satisfactory @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) gap opening by photoevaporative winds ( gorti , dullemond & hollenbach 2009 ; owen , ercolano & clarke 2011 ) .",
    "if the mass loss rate of photoevaporative winds exceeds the mass accretion rate of viscous evolution , a gap can open .",
    "however , before a gap opens , the mass accretion rate largely decreases and becomes much less than @xmath5 @xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is the case even with x - ray photoevaporation with the mass loss rate as high as @xmath5 @xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the sizes of the inner holes due to photoevaporation can not be larger than 20 au when mass accretion onto the central star still remains .",
    "( 2 ) dust growth ( dullemond & dominik 2005 ; tanaka , himeno & ida 2005 ) .",
    "this is expected particularly in inner discs as the models show that the growth time of dust has strong dependence on distance from the central star",
    ". however , dust growth alone can not be responsible for transition discs , because the models for dust growth predict smooth opacity changes with radius whereas observed transition discs show clear gaps of dust .",
    "( 3 ) gap opening by giant planets .",
    "@xcite show that multiple giant planets can open a gap as wide as the largest holes observed",
    ". however , depletion of the surface density in the gap results in a large decrease of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the most probable source of the disc viscosity is the turbulent viscosity caused by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) . since the ionization rate in the thick inner disc is not high enough , a poorly ionized layer with a low viscosity called a dead zone forms near the disc midplane sandwiched by mri active layers ( gammie 1996 ; zhu , hartmann & gammie 2010 ) .",
    "this type of accretion is named layered accretion . in this paper , we develop a gas disc model which takes into account layered accretion and photoevaporative winds .",
    "layered accretion has not been taken into account in previous works of photoevaporation .",
    "as we will show , our disc model can reproduce some of important properties of observed transition discs , such as large gap sizes and high mass accretion rates .    in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our gas disc model . in sec .  3 ,",
    "results are shown for both discs with and without layered accretion over wide ranges of parameters . in sec .  4 ,",
    "implications for transitions discs are discussed . in sec .  5 ,",
    "the summary of this study is given .",
    "we assume that mass accretion from a molecular cloud core has already completed and that the mass of the central star is fixed during disc evolution .",
    "time evolution of the surface density @xmath6 is derived from the mass and angular momentum conservation equations : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass accretion rate ( assumed to be positive for inward accretion ) , @xmath10 is the mass loss flux of photoevaporative winds , @xmath11 is the specific angular momentum with @xmath12 being the keplerian frequency , and @xmath13 is the angular momentum flux transferred by the disc viscosity , @xmath14 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : massc ] ) and ( [ eq : angc ] ) , the mass accretion rate is obtained as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radial velocity . substituting this form to eq .",

    "the isothermal sound velocity is given as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the gas constant , @xmath23 is the disc temperature at the midplane , and we take the mean molecular weight as @xmath24 = 2.33 g mol@xmath4 . for models without dead zones , @xmath0 is radially constant . for models with dead zones ,",
    "the @xmath0 parameters for active surface layers and dead zones are defined to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "then , the effective disc viscosity parameter is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sum of the surface densities of both sides of active layers . in simulations ,",
    "we adopt @xmath29 .",

    "the surface densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 particularly depend on dust amount in the disc , as recombination of ions and electrons occurs on the dust surface @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite uses @xmath31 = 12 g @xmath38 and @xmath32 = 25 g @xmath38 , whereas @xcite adopts nominal values as @xmath31 = 200 g @xmath38 and @xmath32 = 0 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 adopted in @xcite comes from the attenuation length of comic rays ( @xmath39 96 g @xmath38 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the dust abundance is negligible , mri is sustained in the layers as thick as the attenuation length @xcite . on the other hand , in the mhd simulations of @xcite , they adopt the ionization degree calculated in @xcite and @xcite assuming that the dust - to - gas ratio be 0.01 . in the present study ,",
    "we vary @xmath31 as a parameter .",
    "on the other hand , we fix @xmath32 to be 25 g @xmath38 , as we find that @xmath32 is less important than @xmath31 for overall disk evolution , in particular , for @xmath40 .",

    "the kinks seen in the @xmath23 profile correspond to the opacity transition temperatures ( 150 k , 180 k , and 1380 k ) and the corresponding kinks are also seen in @xmath6 . the direction of the radial gas motion is inward in the inner disc and outward in the outer disc , and the zero radial velocity radius expands with disc expansion .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath9 is independent of @xmath55 in the inner disc and is equivalent to the mass accretion rate onto the central star @xmath46 , as long as @xmath9 is sufficiently larger than the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath46 becomes less than @xmath56 , @xmath6 rapidly decreases and eventually a gap opens at slightly beyond 1 au , as well as simulations in @xcite . once a gap opens , the inner disc ( inside the gap ) disperses very quickly and mass accretion onto the central star stops .",
    "the hole size is only 1.3 au at this time .",
    "the temperature increases when the disc becomes optically thin , but this phase ( with a non - zero gas density ) is very short .    the gap opening slightly outside @xmath57 is explained as follows .",
    "let us assume that the inward mass flux due to viscous accretion at @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "as gas moves inward by @xmath60 , the mass flux is reduced by @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the inward mass flux decreases with decreasing @xmath55 and eventually becomes zero at @xmath57 if @xmath62 .",
    "thus , if @xmath9 is independent of @xmath55 without photoevaporation , a gap inevitably opens near @xmath57 . since it takes a time for gas to radially move from @xmath58 to @xmath57 ( the viscous time scale at @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 becomes much less than @xmath56 at the time of actual gap opening ( see the black curve in fig .  1 ) .",
    "in some runs , large gaps can open ( runs n3 and n6 ; see table  4 ) .",

    "the mass accretion rates onto the central stars at the time of gap opening are much smaller than those seen in transition discs .",
    "overall , a large accretion rate and a large hole size are not simultaneously reproduced as long as @xmath0 is radially constant .",
    "pictures of evolution of discs with dead zones are very different from those without dead zones .",

    "the direction of radial motion of gas is outward outside the outer dead zone , while it is inward in the dead zone region .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the mass fluxes in both directions are similar to each other . since the size of the dead zone is @xmath65 au , most of gas removal by photoevaporation is taken place outside the dead zone region .",
    "a discussion of gap opening due to photoevaporation is similar to the case of fig .  1 , but now the mass flux is outward .",

    "this indicates that dust removal due to their growth or migration is necessary whereas our current model adopts a fixed opacity .",
    "since dust is usually supplied from the outer discs ( brauer , dullemond & henning 2008 ) , gap opening may make the inner discs or dead zones optically thin .",
