    "many complex systems are often described by means of a network of interacting components , i.e. a set of nodes connected by links @xcite .",
    "a large number of scientific fields involve the study of networks in some form : networks have been used to analyze interpersonal social relationships , communication systems , international trade , financial systems , co - authorships and citations , protein interaction patterns , and much more .",
    "therefore , formal stochastic models and statistical techniques for the analysis of network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of study .",
    "the distribution of the number of node s connections is well approximated by a power - law in many contexts and preferential attachment is generally accepted as the simplest mechanism that can reproduce such a distribution @xcite .",
    "this basic mechanism , however , is only one of the many forces that can contribute to shape the evolution of complex networks .",
    "for instance , a social network having power - law degree distribution is an exception rather than the rule .",
    "in particular , preferential attachment is not able to reproduce the formation of social groups , or communities , and the composition of social circles .",
    "_ assortativity _ ( or assortative mixing ) , called homophily in social networks , is defined as the prevalence of network - links between nodes that are similar to each other in some respect .",
    "network theorists often analyze assortativity in terms of a node s degree @xcite .",
    "moreover , a large body of research in sociology and , more recently , in economics , confirms the presence of a multidimensional assortativity in socio - economic networks : homophily , along the lines of race and ethnicity , age and sex , education , professional background and occupation , shapes complex networks such as friendship , marriage , teamwork , co - membership , exchange and communication networks @xcite .",
    "the assortativity property has been also studied in citation networks : for instance , in @xcite authors analyze the citations among papers ( the nodes of the network ) published in journals of the american physical society with respect to their pacs classification codes , that represent the different research sub - fields . in formal models assortativity is typically represented by partitioning nodes into different classes ( also called groups , clusters , or types ) related to some ( observable or unobservable ) features @xcite .",
    "the assumption that each node can belong only to a single class and/or the fact that the number of classes is finite and fixed a priori as well as the number of the possible features restrict their applicability . + we contribute to this growing body of literature by introducing a new stochastic model accounting for multidimensional assortativity .",
    "the study of networks of papers , such as co - authorship or citation networks @xcite , is a particularly suitable application of our model as the generative processes of features and links are consistent with the basic aspects of the model : first , it is a growing network process where nodes appear in chronological order and do not exit ; second , the links are established at the entrance of the nodes and are unchangeable along time ; third , each node exhibits some features ( for example , key - words , main topics , etc . ) that are unchangeable during time ; finally , the set of the features grows in time and the evolution of the nodes - features structure is interesting exactly as the process of the link - creation among the nodes .",
    "indeed , the description of both phenomena is very important for the understanding of the diffusion process of ideas and discoveries inside a certain research field and among different research fields . anyway , as we will discuss at the end of this paper , our model can be easily modified and/or enriched in order to get variants that better fit networks of a different type . + in particular , besides the link - creation mechanism , our model provides a stochastic dynamics for the evolution of the features . differently from the above quoted works ( see , for instance , the model in @xcite and the related discussion about the selection problem for the dimension of the feature - space )",
    ", we do not fix a priori the total number of possible features but we allow the number of observed features to grow in time .",
    "the bipartite nodes - features network ( i.e. the surrounding context ) grows according to a stochastic model that depends on three parameters that respectively regulate the preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to the nodes , the number of new features per node , and the power - law behavior of the total number of observed features .",
    "concerning this point , the present paper may be considered as a companion article to @xcite .",
    "indeed , both of them provide an evolving dynamics for the feature - structure , but they also show some differences .",
    "the main issue is that here we introduce a parameter that tunes the preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to the nodes ; while in @xcite authors only consider a preferential attachment rule .",
    "moreover , in that paper a random `` fitness '' parameter which determines the node s ability to transmit its own features to other nodes ( see also @xcite ) is attached to each node ; while here we do not take into account fitness parameters for nodes .",
    "+ coming from a structural approach , differently from other models which concentrate only on assortativity @xcite , our model also accounts for the principle , known as _",
    "triadic closure _ or transitivity , according to which , if a is a neighbor of b and b is a neighbor of c , then a and c have a high chance to be neighbors .",
    "this principle is widely supported on the empirical ground and it is at the basis of many generative network models @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the expression `` triadic closure '' conceptually refers to a link - formation process not depending on the features of the nodes that get attached .",
    "however , also assortativity can naturally induce closed triplets in the network and hence evaluating assortativity and triadic closure separately sometimes may be not easy .",
    "( for a further discussion on this issue , we refer to the next section [ estimation ] . )",
    "anyway models based on both mechanisms produce more realistic networks .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows . in section [ ass ]",
    "we describe the basic assumptions of our model and the notation used throughout the paper . in section [ model ]",
    "we present our stochastic model , that involves a dynamics for the bipartite network of nodes - features and the mechanism underlying the formation of the unipartite ( i.e. node - node ) network . in section [ meaning ]",
    "we illustrate some theoretical results and we carefully explain the meaning of each parameter inside our model . in section",
    "[ estimation ] we show and discuss some statistical tools in order to estimate the model parameters from the data . in section [ sim ]",
    "we provide a number of simulations in order to point out the functioning of the model parameters and the ability of the proposed estimation tools .",
    "section [ real - data ] deals with an application of our model and instruments to a co - authorship network .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we give our conclusions and discuss some future developments .",
    "the paper is enriched by an appendix that contains a theorem and its proof , and supplementary simulation results .",
    "we assume new nodes sequentially join the network so that node @xmath0 represents the one that comes into the network at time step @xmath0 .",
    "each node shows a finite number of features , that can be of different kinds ( key - words , main topics , spatial / geographical contexts , profile , etc . ) , and different nodes can share the same features .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that we do not specify a priori the total number of possible features but we allow the number of observed features to increase along time . on its arrival ,",
    "each new node links to some nodes already present in the system .",
    "firstly , links are created according to probabilities that depend on the number of common features ( multidimensional assortativity ) . then additional links can be established by means of common neighbors , inducing the closure of some triangles ( triadic closure ) .",
    "we consider the connections as undirected , non - breakable and we omit self - loops ( i.e. edges of type @xmath1 ) . in particular , this means that connections are mutual or the direction is naturally predefined ( for instance , only citations from newer to older nodes are possible ) .",
    "we denote the adjacency matrix ( symmetric by assumption ) by @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 when there exists a link between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "we set @xmath6 to be the set of node @xmath4 s neighbors at time step @xmath0 ( after the arrival of @xmath0 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the binary bipartite network where each row @xmath8 represents the features of node @xmath0 : @xmath9 if node @xmath0 has feature @xmath10 , @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "it represents the surrounding context in which the nodes interact .",
    "we assume that each @xmath8 is unchangeable during time .",
    "we take @xmath7 left - ordered : this means that in the first row the columns for which @xmath12 are grouped on the left and hence , if the first node has @xmath13 features , then the columns of @xmath7 with index @xmath14 represent these features .",
    "the second node could have some features in common with the first node ( those corresponding to indices @xmath10 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and some , say @xmath17 , new features .",
    "the latter are grouped on the right of the set for which @xmath12 , i.e. , the columns of @xmath7 with index @xmath18 represent the new features brought by the second node . this grouping structure persists throughout the matrix @xmath7 and we define @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 here is an example of a @xmath7 matrix with @xmath21 nodes : @xmath22 in gray we show the new features brought by each node ( in the example @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and so @xmath26 ) .",
    "observe that , for every node @xmath0 , the @xmath0-th row contains 1 for all the columns with indices @xmath27 ( they represent the new features brought by @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , some elements of the columns with indices @xmath28 are also @xmath29 ( features brought by previous nodes adopted by node @xmath0 ) .",
    "fix @xmath30 , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 $ ] and let @xmath34 $ ] be an increasing function . the dynamics is the following .",
    "node 1 arrives and shows @xmath13 features , where @xmath13 is poi@xmath35-distributed ( the symbol poi@xmath35 denotes the poisson distribution with mean @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , for each @xmath37 ,    * * feature - structure dynamics : * node @xmath0 arrives and shows a number of features as follows : * * node @xmath0 exhibits some of the _ `` old '' _ features brought by the previous nodes @xmath38 : more precisely , each feature @xmath39 is , independently of the others , possessed by node @xmath0 with probability ( that we call `` inclusion - probability '' ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 if node @xmath4 shows feature @xmath10 and @xmath42 otherwise . *",
    "* node @xmath0 also shows @xmath43 _ `` new '' _ features , where @xmath43 is poi@xmath44-distributed with @xmath45 + ( @xmath46 is independent of @xmath47 and of the exhibited `` old '' features . ) + the matrix element @xmath48 is set equal to @xmath29 if node @xmath0 has feature @xmath10 and equal to zero otherwise . *",
    "* network construction : * on its arrival , node @xmath0 determines a set @xmath49 of neighbors among the nodes already present in the network ( so that we set @xmath50 for each @xmath51 ) as follows : * * ( _ first phase _ ) first , a set @xmath52 of neighbors of node @xmath0 is established on the basis of the features shown .",
    "each node @xmath4 already present in the network ( i.e. @xmath53 ) is included in @xmath52 , independently of the others , with probability @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of features that @xmath0 and @xmath4 have in common . * * ( _ second phase _ )",
    "then some extra neighbors are added to @xmath49 on the basis of common neighbors . for every node @xmath56 , each node @xmath57 ( i.e. each neighbor that @xmath0 and @xmath4 currently share ) can induce , independently of the others , the additional link @xmath58 with probability @xmath59 .",
    "we now illustrate the meaning of the model parameters and some mathematical results regarding our model .",
    "let us start with @xmath36 and @xmath60 .",
    "the main effect of @xmath60 is to regulate the asymptotic behavior of the random variable @xmath61 defined in as a function of @xmath62 . in particular",
    ", @xmath63 is the _ power - law exponent _ of @xmath61 .",
    "the main effect of @xmath36 is the following : the larger @xmath36 , the larger the total number of new features brought by a node .",
    "it is worth to note that @xmath60 fits the asymptotic behavior of @xmath61 and then , separately , @xmath36 fits the number of new observed features per node .",
    "( in section [ simulations - f ] we will discuss more deeply this fact . )",
    "more precisely , we prove ( see the appendix ) the following asymptotic behaviors :    * for @xmath64 , we have a logarithmic behavior of @xmath61 , that is @xmath65 ; * for @xmath66 $ ] , we obtain a power - law behavior , i.e. @xmath67 .      the parameter @xmath68 tunes the phenomenon of _ preferential attachment _ in the spreading process of features among nodes .",
    "the value @xmath69 corresponds to the `` pure preferential attachment case '' : the larger the weight of a feature @xmath10 at time step @xmath70 ( given by the numerator of the second element in ( [ inclusion - prob ] ) , i.e. , the total number of nodes that exhibit it until time step @xmath70 ) , the greater the probability that @xmath10 will be shown by the future node @xmath0 .",
    "the value @xmath71 corresponds to the `` pure i.i.d .",
    "case '' with inclusion probability equal to @xmath72 : a node includes each feature with probability @xmath72 independently of the other nodes and the other features .",
    "when @xmath73 , we have a mixture of the two cases above : the smaller @xmath68 , the more significant is the role played by preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to new nodes .",
    "according to our model , when a new node enters the system , it links to some ( possibly zero , one , or more ) old nodes by means of the two phases network construction described in section [ model ] . in the first phase , a new node @xmath0 connects itself to some of the old nodes according to a probability depending on its own features and the ones of the others .",
    "the function @xmath74 relates the `` first - phase link - probability '' of @xmath0 to @xmath4 ( with @xmath53 ) to their `` similarity '' @xmath75 defined by ( [ similarity ] ) .",
    "since @xmath74 is assumed to be an increasing function , a higher number of common features between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath4 induces a larger probability for them to connect ( akin the principle of assortativity ) . for instance , we can take the generalization of the logistic function , i.e. the sigmoid function @xmath76 the sigmoid function smoothly increases ( from @xmath77 to @xmath29 ) around a threshold @xmath78 , while @xmath79 controls its smoothness : the bigger @xmath79 , the steeper the sigmoid .",
    "in particular , @xmath80 and @xmath81 give the logistic function and , for @xmath82 , @xmath74 approaches to a step function equal to @xmath29 or @xmath77 , if the variable @xmath83 is respectively greater or smaller than @xmath78 ( in our model , @xmath84 means that the links are established deterministically based on whether the two involved nodes have , or not , a similarity bigger than @xmath78 ) . in the second phase , node @xmath0 can connect to some of the nodes discarded in the first phase by means of common neighbors ( triadic closure ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 regulates this phenomenon .",
    "indeed , it represents the probability that a node causes a link between two of its neighbors .",
    "more precisely , in the second phase , the probability of having a link between node @xmath0 and a node @xmath85 is @xmath86 $ ] , where @xmath87 is the number of common neighbors of @xmath0 and @xmath4 after the first phase .",
    "consequently , the `` second - phase link - probability '' between a pair of nodes increases with respect to @xmath59 and the number of neighbors they share .",
    "the case @xmath88 corresponds to the case in which the connections only depend on the similarity among nodes .",
    "the case @xmath89 corresponds to the case in which the connection is automatically established when @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we illustrate how to estimate the model parameters from the data .",
    "+ suppose we can observe the values of @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath62 rows of the matrix @xmath7 , where @xmath62 is the number of observed nodes . from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath61 , we get that @xmath92 is a strongly consistent estimator for @xmath60 , hence we can use the slope @xmath93 of the regression line in the log - log plot ( of @xmath61 as a function of @xmath62 ) as an estimate for @xmath60 .    after computing @xmath93 , we can estimate @xmath36 as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the slope of the regression line in the plot @xmath96 or in the plot @xmath97 according to whether @xmath98 or @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "we can estimate @xmath68 by means of a maximum likelihood procedure . for this purpose",
    ", we now give a general expression of the probability of observing @xmath100 given the parameters @xmath101 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the first row @xmath102 is simply identified by @xmath103 and so @xmath104 then the second row is identified by the values @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , and by @xmath17 , so that @xmath107 where @xmath108 is defined in ( [ inclusion - prob ] ) and @xmath109 is defined in ( [ lambda ] ) . the general formula is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is defined in ( [ inclusion - prob ] ) and @xmath112 is defined in ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath62 nodes , we can write a formula for the probability of observing @xmath100 : @xmath113 therefore , we look for @xmath114 that maximizes the likelihood function , i.e. the quantity @xmath115 as a function of @xmath68 ( given the observed vectors @xmath116 ) . since some factors do not depend on @xmath68 , we can simplify the function to be maximized as @xmath117 or , equivalently , passing to the logarithm , as @xmath118 + now , suppose that we are also allowed to observe the adjacency matrix @xmath119 ( meaning the final adjacency matrix after the arrival of all the @xmath62 observed nodes and the formation of all their links ) and to know which are the links that each of the @xmath62 observed nodes formed only by means of the previously described first phase ( i.e. only due to assortativity ) .",
    "denote by @xmath120 the adjacency matrix collecting them .",
    "then , if we decide to model the function @xmath74 as in ( [ sigmoid ] ) , we can choose @xmath79 , @xmath78 , and @xmath59 , in order to fit some properties of the observed matrices @xmath121 and @xmath2 . for instance , if @xmath122 is the number of observed ( undirected ) links in matrix @xmath121 ( i.e. only due to the first phase of network construction ) and @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a fixed value that we choose , then we can determine @xmath125 and @xmath126 by solving ( numerically ) the following system of two equations : @xmath127 & e\\left[\\sum_{i , j : 2\\leq i\\leq n , 1\\leq j\\leq i-1 } a'_{i , j}\\right ] = \\sum_{i=2}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\phi\\left(s_{i , j}\\right)=   \\\\ & \\sum_{i=2}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1 } \\left(1 + e^{k({\\vartheta}- s^*)+k(s^*-\\sum_{k=1}^{l_i } f_{i , k } f_{j , k } ) } \\right)^{-1}=\\ell .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] by means of the first equation , we fit the probability that a pair of nodes with @xmath124 features in common establishes a link ( during the first phase of network construction ) ; while , by the second equation , we set the expected number of links in @xmath121 equal to the observed @xmath122 . from the first equation",
    ", we get the quantity @xmath128 , we then replace it in the second one in order to obtain @xmath79 and from this we get @xmath78 .",
    "note that this is not a proper estimation procedure , but rather a selection mechanism for @xmath79 and @xmath78 in order to fit some observed properties of the network .",
    "after that , we can estimate @xmath59 by means of a maximum likelihood procedure based on the observed matrices .",
    "+ some important remarks follow .",
    "if in the considered situation the formation of links only occur according to the first phase ( i.e. as a result of the assortativity property ) , then we can set @xmath88 as in this case the presence of closed triplets is only caused by common features and the matrix @xmath2 coincides with @xmath121 .",
    "then we have no problem to implement the previous procedures for detecting all the model parameters .",
    "when we have both phases of network construction ( i.e. @xmath129 ) , the detection of @xmath130 , and @xmath59 may generate some problems since the available data are typically @xmath7 and @xmath2 , while , in order to implement the above procedure , we also need to observe @xmath121 .",
    "when we can not observe @xmath121 , we may try to reconstruct it from @xmath2 in some consistent way , if it is possible for the considered application @xcite . however , every empirical criterion used to distinguish between the two different types of links ( the ones due to the first phase and the ones induced by the second phase ) , obviously has some degree of arbitrariness and it can be hard to understand the bias implied by it .",
    "an example of this problem can be found in @xcite regarding a citation network . in the case",
    "no suitable criterion is found , we may try to select @xmath130 , and @xmath59 in such a way that some properties of the adjacency matrix generated by the model are close to the observed one .",
    "statistical procedures that integrate out unobserved variables ( in this case , @xmath121 ) or expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithms are also possible and they will be subject of future developments . therefore , although assortativity and triadic closure are theoretically well separated concepts , in practice there are situations in which estimating them singly is not a simple task .",
    "however , their combination is often necessary in order to get models that produce realistic networks . the simulation of the model with the observed matrix @xmath7 and @xmath88 can be useful as a benchmark .",
    "in this section , we present a number of simulations performed following the dynamics for the features selection and links creation described in section [ model ] . we simulated the outcome for feature matrices and for unipartite networks of @xmath131 nodes , on a sample of @xmath132 realizations . regarding the feature - selection dynamics , we analyzed the resulting feature matrices ( constructed as explained in section [ ass ] ) for different values of the model parameters @xmath36 , @xmath60 , and @xmath68 , responsible respectively of the number of new features per node , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath61 defined in , and the phenomenon of preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to new nodes .",
    "after that , we simulated the network construction taking @xmath74 as in and analyzed its properties for different values of @xmath68 , @xmath79 , and @xmath59 , while @xmath78 is determined according to a certain number @xmath122 of ( undirected ) links due to the first phase of the unipartite network construction .",
    "as said before , parameter @xmath36 is responsible for the number of new features per node : the larger @xmath36 , the higher the number of new features per node . concerning this",
    ", it is very important to stress that also the parameter @xmath60 affects the number of features per node , but the idea is that we select first @xmath60 , in order to fit the asymptotic behavior of @xmath61 , and then @xmath36 in order to fit the number of new features per node .",
    "+ in the first set of simulations we kept @xmath134 and @xmath135 fixed and we built the feature matrix for different values of @xmath136 . in figure [ matrices - alpha ] we can see the shapes of the feature matrices ( where colored points denote non - zero values , i.e. @xmath29 ) for the three different values of @xmath36 .",

    "although the curves related to real data are obviously more irregular , the curves generated by simulations properly fit to the observed ones .",
    "in this paper , we presented a new network model , where each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of a link between two nodes depends on the number of features and neighbors they share , so that it includes two of the most observed phenomena in complex systems : assortativity , i.e. the prevalence of network - links between nodes that are similar to each other in some sense , and triadic closure , meant as the high probability of having a link between a pair of nodes due to common neighbors .",
    "the bipartite network of nodes and features grows according to a stochastic dynamics that depends on three parameters respectively regulating the preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to the nodes , the number of new features per node , and the power - law behavior of the total number of observed features .",
    "we provide theoretical results and statistical tools for the estimation of the model parameters involved in the feature - structure dynamics . from the observation of the feature - matrix",
    ", we completely determine the parameters , @xmath245 , that regulate its evolution .",
    "we provide a procedure for recovering the two parameters , @xmath246 , of the function @xmath74 , which relates the link probability between two nodes to their similarity in terms of common features , and the parameter @xmath59 which tunes triadic closure .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ estimation ] , for this last point , we need to know which are the links formed by assortativity and those formed by triadic closure , but often they are not easily distinguishable",
    ". therefore we aim in the future to evaluate more sophisticated estimation techniques for this issue .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in section [ real - data ] , we can still exploit the proposed procedure in order to guess a good combination of these parameters . + the originality and the merit of our model mainly lie in the double temporal dynamics ( one for the feature - structure and one for the network of nodes ) , but also in the attention given to both assortativity and triadic closure mechanisms .",
    "we underline that , differently from other models in the literature , we do not require to specify a priori the values of some hyperparameters , such as the total number of possible features ( avoiding some selection problems discussed in @xcite ) . in the future , we aim at improving our model in order to make it suitable for other kind of networks , e.g. real social networks ( such as friendship networks ) .",
    "in particular , the following variations are possible :    * _ normalizing the number of common features : _ we can vary the model by replacing the factor @xmath247 in formula ( [ similarity ] ) with @xmath248 so that the contribution of a common feature @xmath10 is smaller when the number of nodes with @xmath10 as a feature is larger . * _ weighted bipartite matrices : _ we can modify the model by replacing in the inclusion - probability and in the link - probability the binary random number @xmath48 by a random weight @xmath249 of the form @xmath250 , where @xmath251 are i.i.d . strictly positive random variables .",
    "( by convention , we set @xmath252 . )",
    "hence , we have @xmath253 \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad   \\sum_{k=1}^{l_i } w_{i , k}=1\\ ] ] so that @xmath249 represents the weight percentage given to feature @xmath10 by node @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the preferential attachment in the inclusion - probability becomes a `` weighted preferential attachment '' , in the sense that it depends on the total weight given to feature @xmath10 by the previous nodes , and the link - probability depends on the weights associated to the common features .",
    "* _ changeable links : _ for some real situations , we need to consider also the case in which the links among nodes can change along time . for instance , we can combine a link - formation model and a link - dissolution model as in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for node exit .",
    "* _ exit of some features and social influence of links on features : _ we can modify the evolution of the feature - structure by accounting for the fact that at each time step @xmath4 ( after the arrival of the node @xmath4 ) some features can become `` obsolete '' and so for such a feature @xmath10 we will have @xmath254 for all @xmath255 . moreover , a node could change some features under the influence of its `` friends '' ( i.e. neighbors ) @xcite . hence , we can introduce a sequence @xmath256 of bipartite matrices such that each @xmath257 provides the features before the arrival of node @xmath258 , so that in the inclusion - probabilities and in the link - probabilities for node @xmath258 , the matrix @xmath7 is replaced by @xmath257 .",
    "* _ different dynamics for triadic closure : _ we can change the second phase of our model by means of different policies for the selection of additional neighbors of a node @xmath0 among the neighbors of @xmath0 s neighbors . indeed , in this paper we consider a binomial model according to which each common neighbor of a pair @xmath58 of not - linked nodes gives , independently of the others , a probability @xmath59 of inducing a link between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "a possible alternative is that , with probability @xmath59 , an additional link for a certain node is formed by the selection ( uniformly at random ) of a node among the neighbors of its neighbors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
