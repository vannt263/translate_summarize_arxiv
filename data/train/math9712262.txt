    "it is shown in @xcite , @xcite that certain seifert manifolds have distinct genus two heegaard splittings ( see also section [ seifert ] below ) . in @xcite we present a technique for comparing heegaard splittings of the same manifold and derive the uniqueness theorem for lens space splittings as a simple corollary .",
    "the intent of this paper is to use the technique of @xcite to examine , in general , how two genus two heegard splittings of the same @xmath0manifold compare .",
    "one potential way of creating genus two heegaard split @xmath0manifolds is to `` stabilize '' a splitting of lower genus ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) ) .",
    "but since , up to isotopy , stabilization is unique and since genus one heegaard splittings are known to be unique , this process can not produce non - isotopic splittings .",
    "so we may as well restrict to genus two splittings that are not stabilized .",
    "a second way of creating a @xmath0manifold equipped with a genus two heegaard splitting is to take the connected sum of two @xmath0manifolds , each with a genus one splitting . but",
    "( again since genus one splittings are unique ) any two heegaard splittings of the same manifold that are constructed in this way can be made to coincide outside a collar of the summing sphere . within that collar",
    "there is one possible difference , a `` spin '' corresponding to the non - trivial element of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 parameterizes unoriented planes in @xmath0space and the spin reverses the two sides of the plane .",
    "put more simply , the two splittings differ only in the choice of which side of the torus in one summand is identified with a given side of the splitting torus in the other summand .",
    "the first examples of this type are given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these easier cases having been considered , interest will now focus on genus two splittings that are `` irreducible '' ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) ) .",
    "it is a consequence of @xcite that a genus two splitting which is irreducible is also `` strongly irreducible '' ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) , or the proof of lemma [ str.irred ] below ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath3 is a heegaard splitting , then any pair of essential disks , one in @xmath4 and one in @xmath5 , have boundaries that intersect in at least two points .",
    "the result of our program is a listing , in sections [ seifert ] and [ examples ] , of all ways in which two strongly irreducible genus two heegaard splittings of the same closed orientable @xmath0manifold @xmath6 compare .",
    "the proof that this is an exhaustive listing is the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "what we do not know is when two heegaard splittings constructed in the ways described are authentically different .",
    "that is , we do not have the sort of algebraic invariants which would allow us to assert that there is no global isotopy of @xmath6 that carries one splitting into another .",
    "for the case of seifert manifolds ( eg @xcite ) such algebraic invariants can be ( non - trivially ) derived from the very explicit form of the fundamental group .",
    "any @xmath0manifold with a genus two heegaard splitting admits an orientation preserving involution whose quotient space is @xmath7 and whose branching locus is a @xmath0bridge knot ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "the examples constructed in section [ examples ] are sufficiently explicit that we can derive from them global theorems . here",
    "are a few : if @xmath6 is an atoroidal closed orientable @xmath0manifold then the involutions coming from distinct heegaard splittings necessarily commute . more generally , the commutator of two different involutions can be obtained by some composition of dehn twists around essential tori in @xmath6 .",
    "finally , two genus two splittings become equivalent after a single stabilization .",
    "the results we obtain easily generalize to compact orientable @xmath0manifolds with boundary , essentially by substituting boundary tori any place in which dehn surgery circles appear .",
    "we expect the methods and results here may be helpful in understanding @xmath0bridge knots ( which appear as branch sets , as described above ) and in understanding the mapping class groups of genus two @xmath0manifolds .",

    "imbed the solid torus @xmath8 in @xmath9 as @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the fixed points of @xmath12 are precisely the two arcs @xmath13 . on the torus @xmath14 the fixed points of @xmath12 are the four points @xmath15 .",
    "for any pair of integers @xmath16 we can define the _",
    "@xmath17 torus link _",
    "@xmath18 to be @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 torus link is a meridian and the @xmath21 torus link is a longitude of the solid torus .",
    "a _ torus knot _ is a torus link of one component which is not a meridian or longitude . in other words ,",
    "a torus knot is a torus link in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 are relatively prime , and neither is zero .",
    "up to orientation preserving homeomorphism of @xmath14 ( given by dehn twists ) we can also assume , for a torus knot , that @xmath24 .    let @xmath18 be a torus knot ,  an arc that spans the annulus @xmath25 and  be a radius of the disk @xmath26 .",
    "then the complement of a neighborhood of @xmath27 in @xmath8 is isotopic to a neighborhood of @xmath28 in @xmath8 .",
    "this fact is useful later in understanding how cabling is affected by stabilization .",
    "clearly @xmath12 preserves any torus link @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 is a torus knot , so @xmath22 and @xmath23 ca nt both be even , the involution @xmath30 has precisely two fixed points : @xmath31 and either @xmath32 , if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are both odd ; or @xmath33 if @xmath22 is even ; or @xmath34 if @xmath23 is even .",
    "this has the following consequence .",
    "let @xmath35 be an equivariant neighborhood of the torus knot @xmath29 in @xmath8 .",

    "create @xmath37 by attaching together two copies of @xmath8 along an equivariant disk neighborhood @xmath38 of @xmath39 in each copy .",
    "then @xmath12 acting simultaneously on both copies will produce an involution of @xmath37 , which we continue to denote @xmath12 . again",
    "the quotient is @xmath40 but the fixed point set consists of three arcs .",
    "( see figure 2 for a topologically equivalent picture . )",
    "we will call @xmath12 the _ standard involution _ on @xmath37 .",
    "it has the following very useful properties : it carries any simple closed curve in @xmath41 to an isotopic copy of the curve , and , up to isotopy , any homeomorphism of @xmath41 commutes with it .",
    "it will later be useful to distinguish involutions of different handlebodies , and since , up to isotopy rel boundary , this involution is determined by its action on @xmath41 , it is legitimate , and will later be useful , to denote the involution by @xmath42 .",
    "two alternative involutions of the genus two handlebody @xmath43 will sometimes be useful .",
    "consider the involution that rotates @xmath37 around a diameter of @xmath38 , exchanging @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "( see figure 3 . )",
    "the diameter is the set of fixed points , and the quotient space is a solid torus .",
    "this will be called the _ minor involution _ on @xmath37 .",
    "the final involution is best understood by thinking of @xmath37 as a neighborhood of the union of two circles that meet so that the planes containing them are perpendicular , as in figure 2 .",
    "then @xmath37 is the union of two solid tori in which a core of fixed points in one solid torus coincides in the other solid torus with a diameter of a fiber . under this identification ,",
    "a full @xmath46 rotation of one solid torus around its core coincides in the other solid torus with the standard involution , and one of the arc of fixed points in the second torus is a subarc of the core of the first .",
    "the quotient of this involution is a solid torus and the fixed point set is the core of the first solid torus together with an additional boundary parallel proper arc in the second solid torus .",
    "this involution will be called the _",
    "circular involution_.    in analogy to definitions in the case of a solid torus , we have :    [ long ] a _ meridian disk _ of a handlebody @xmath37 is an essential disk in @xmath37 .",
    "its boundary is a _ meridian curve _ , or , more simply , a meridian . a _ longitude _ of @xmath37 is a simple closed curve in @xmath41 that intersects some meridian curve exactly once . a meridian disk can be separating or non - separating .",
    "two longitudes @xmath47 are _ separated longitudes _ if they lie on opposite sides of a separating meridian disk .",
    "there is a useful way of imbedding one genus two handlebody in another .",
    "begin with @xmath48 , on which @xmath12 operates as above .",
    "let @xmath35 be an equivariant neighborhood of a torus knot in @xmath44 .",
    "choose @xmath35 large enough ( or @xmath38 small enough ) that @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50 is a new genus two handlebody on which @xmath12 continues to act .",
    "in fact @xmath51 .",
    "we say the handlebody @xmath52 is obtained by _ cabling into _ @xmath37 or , dually , @xmath37 is obtained by cabling out of @xmath52 .",
    "( see figure 4 . )",
    "there is another useful way to view cabling into @xmath37 .",
    "recall the process of dehn surgery : let @xmath53 be a rational number and  be a simple closed curve in a @xmath0manifold @xmath6 .",
    "then we say a manifold @xmath54 is obtained from @xmath6 by _",
    "@xmath53surgery on _ if a solid torus neighborhood @xmath55 is removed from @xmath6 and is replaced by a solid torus whose meridian is attached to @xmath56 . unless there is a natural choice of longitude for @xmath57 ( eg when @xmath58 ) , @xmath53 is only defined modulo the integers or , put another way , we can with no loss of generality take @xmath59 .",
    "if we take  to be the core @xmath60 and perform @xmath53 surgery , then the result @xmath54 is still a solid torus , but @xmath61 becomes a meridian of @xmath54 .",
    "the curve @xmath62 , with @xmath63 becomes a longitude of @xmath54 , because it intersects @xmath64 in one point .",
    "a longitude @xmath65 becomes the torus knot @xmath66 because it intersects a longitude @xmath22 times and a meridian @xmath23 times .",
    "so another way of viewing @xmath67 is this : attach a neighborhood ( containing @xmath38 , but disjoint from @xmath68 ) of the longitude @xmath69 to @xmath70 to form @xmath52 .",
    "then do @xmath53 surgery to  to give @xmath37 containing @xmath52 .",
    "the advantage of this point of view is that the construction is more obviously @xmath12 equivariant ( since both the longitude and the core  are clearly preserved by @xmath12 ) once we observe once and for all , from the earlier viewpoint ( see figure 1 ) , that dehn surgery is @xmath12 equivariant .",
    "of course it is also possible to cable into @xmath37 via a similar construction in @xmath70 , perhaps at the same time as we cable in via @xmath44 .",
    "a heegaard splitting of a closed orientable @xmath0manifold @xmath6 is a decomposition @xmath3 in which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are handlebodies , and @xmath71 . in other words , @xmath6 is obtained by gluing two handlebodies together by some homeomorphism of their boundaries . if the splitting is genus two , then the splitting induces an involution on @xmath6 .",
    "indeed the standard involutions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be made to coincide on @xmath72 , since the standard involution on @xmath4 , say , commutes with the gluing homeomorphism @xmath73 .",
    "so we can regard @xmath74 as an involution of @xmath6 ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in understanding closed orientable @xmath0manifolds that admit more than one isotopy class of genus two heegaard splitting .",
    "that is , splittings @xmath75 in which the genus two surfaces @xmath72 and @xmath76 are not isotopic .",
    "( a separate but related question is whether there is an ambient _ homeomorphism _ which carries one to the other , ie , whether the splittings are _ homeomorphic_. ) in this section we begin by discussing a class of manifolds for which the answer is well understood .",
    "it is a consequence of the classification theorem of moriah and schultens @xcite that heegaard splittings of closed seifert manifolds ( with orientable base and fiberings ) are either `` vertical '' or `` horizontal '' .",
    "the consequence which is relevant here is that any such seifert manifold which has a genus two splitting is in fact a seifert manifold over @xmath77 with three exceptional fibers . through earlier work of boileau and otal @xcite",
    "it was already known that genus two splittings of these manifolds were either vertical or horizontal and this led boileau , collins and zieschang @xcite and , independently , moriah @xcite to give a complete classification of genus 2 heegaard decompositions in this case . in general , there are several .",
    "most ( the vertical splittings ) can be constructed as follows : take regular neighborhoods of two exceptional fibers and connect them with an arc ( transverse to the fibering ) that projects to an imbedded arc in the base space connecting the two exceptional points , which are the projections of the exceptional fibers .",
    "any two such arcs are isotopic , so the only choice involved is in the pair of exceptional fibers .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this choice can make a difference ",
    "different choices can result in heegaard splittings that are not even homeomorphic .",
    "the various vertical splittings do have one common property , however .",
    "they all share the same standard involution .",
    "all that is involved in demonstrating this is the proper construction of the involution on the seifert manifold @xmath6 . in the base space ,",
    "put all three exceptional fibers on the equator of the sphere .",
    "now consider the orientation preserving involution of @xmath6 that simultaneously reverses the direction of every fiber and reflects the base @xmath77 through the equator ( ie , exchanges the fiber lying over a point with the fiber lying over its reflection ) .",
    "this involution induces the natural involution on a neighborhood of any fiber that lies over the equator , specifically the exceptional fibers .",
    "if we choose two of them , and connect them via a subarc of the equator , the involution on @xmath6 is the standard involution on the corresponding heegaard splitting .",
    "two types of seifert manifolds have additional splittings ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.5 ) ) .",
    "one , denoted @xmath78 , is the @xmath79fold branched cover of the @xmath0bridge torus knot @xmath80 , and the other , denoted @xmath81 , is a @xmath79fold branched cover over the @xmath0bridge link which is the union of the torus knot @xmath82 and the core of the solid torus on which it lies . since these are three  bridge links , there is a sphere that divides them each into two families of three unknotted arcs in @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath79fold branched cover of three unknotted arcs in @xmath40 is just the genus two handlebody ( in fact the inverse operation to quotienting out by the standard involution ) .",
    "so this view of the links defines a heegaard splitting on the double  branched cover @xmath6 .    in both cases",
    "the natural fibering of @xmath7 by torus knots of the relevant slope lifts to the seifert fibering on the double  branched cover .",
    "the torus knots lie on tori , each of which induces a genus one heegaard splitting of @xmath7 .",
    "the natural involution of @xmath7 defined by this splitting ( rotation about an unknot  in @xmath7 that intersects the cores of both solid tori , see ( * ? ?",
    "* figures 4 and 5 ) ) , preserves the fibering of @xmath7 and induces the natural involution on any fiber that intersects its axis .",
    "we can arrange that the exceptional fibers ( including those on which we take the @xmath79fold branched cover ) intersect .",
    "then the standard involution of @xmath7 simultaneously does three things .",
    "it induces the standard involution  on @xmath6 that comes from its vertical heegaard decomposition @xmath3 ; it preserves the @xmath0bridge link @xmath83 that is the image of the fixed point set of the other involution ; and it preserves the sphere which lifts to the other heegaard surface @xmath84 , while interchanging @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it follows easily that  and  commute .",
    "the product of the two involutions is again the standard involution , but with a different axis of symmetry . to see how this can be ,",
    "note that the involution  is in fact just a flow of @xmath46 along each regular fiber and also along the exceptional fibers other than the branch fibers .",
    "since the branch fibers have even index , a flow of @xmath46 on regular fibers induces the identity on the branch fibers .",
    "so in fact  is isotopic to the identity ( just flow along the fibers ) . the fixed point set of  intersects any exceptional fiber in two points , @xmath46 apart ; indeed it is a reflection of the fiber across those two fixed points . hence  carries the fixed point set of  to itself and the involutions commute .",
    "the composition @xmath87 is also a reflection in each exceptional fiber  but through a pair of points which differ by @xmath88 from the points across which , in an exceptional fiber ,  reflects .",
    "see figure 5 .",
    "in this section we will list a number of ways of constructing @xmath0manifolds @xmath6 , not necessarily seifert manifolds , which support multiple genus two heegaard splittings .",
    "that is , it will follow from the construction that @xmath6 has two or more heegaard splittings which are at least not obviously isotopic .",
    "the constructions are elementary enough that in all cases it will be easy to see that a single stabilization suffices to make them isotopic .",
    "( we will only rarely comment on this stabilization property . )",
    "they are symmetric enough that in all cases we will be able to see directly how the corresponding involutions of @xmath6 are related .",
    "when @xmath6 contains no essential separating tori then , in many cases , the involutions from the different heegaard splittings will be the same and , in all cases , the involutions will at least commute .",
    "when @xmath6 does contain essential separating tori , the same will be true after possibly some dehn twists around essential tori .",
    "suppose @xmath89 is a collar of an essential torus in a compact orientable @xmath0manifold @xmath6 .",
    "then a homeomorphism @xmath90 is obtained by a _ dehn twist _ around @xmath91 if @xmath92 is the identity on @xmath93 .",
    "ultimately we will show that any manifold that admits multiple splittings will do so because the manifold , and any pair of different splittings , appears on the list below .",
    "this will allow us to make conclusions about how the involutions determined by multiple splittings are related .",
    "what we are unable to determine is when the examples which appear here actually do give non - isotopic splittings . for this one would need to demonstrate that there is no _ global _ isotopy of @xmath6 carrying one splitting to another",
    "this requires establishing a property of the splitting that is invariant under nielsen moves and showing that the property is different for two splittings .",
    "for example , the very rich structure of seifert manifold fundamental groups was exploited in @xcite to establish that some splittings were even globally non - isotopic .    alternatively , as in @xcite",
    ", one could show that the associated involutions have fixed sets which project to inequivalent knots or links in @xmath7 .",
    "note that non - isotopic splittings can probably arise even when the associated involutions have fixed sets projecting tot he same knots or links in @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", there would be inequivalent @xmath0bridge representations of these knots or links .",
    "consider the graph @xmath94 consisting of two orthogonal polar great circles .",
    "one polar circle will be denoted and the other will be thought of as two edges @xmath95 and @xmath96 attached to .",
