    "the seminal works on traversable wormholes and thin - shell wormholes ( tsws ) , respectively by morris and thorne @xcite and visser @xcite both employed spherical / cylindrical @xcite geometry at the throats . besides instability of tsws @xcite and the wormholes supported by ghost scalar field @xcite one major problem in this venture is the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "precisely , tsws allow presence of exotic matter at the throat with @xmath3 in which @xmath4 is the energy density on the hypersurface of the throat .",
    "several attempts have been made to introduce the tsws supported by normal matter of the kind with @xmath5 in the framework of the gauss - bonnet theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "we aim in this study to seek for @xmath6 against violation of nec by changing the spherical / circular geometry to more general , angular dependent throats in the wormholes .",
    "that is , since nec is violated a different choice of frame may account a negative energy density .",
    "motivation for such a study originates from the consideration of zipoy - voorhees ( zv ) metrics which surpasses spherical symmetry with a quadrupole moment by employing a distortion parameter @xcite . in brief",
    ", this amounts to compress a sphere into an ellipsoidal form through a distortion mechanism .",
    "this minor change contributes to the total energy and makes it positive in the static reference frame under certain conditions . in local angular intervals",
    "we confront still with negative energies in part but the integral of the total energy happens to be positive .",
    "we recall that any rotating system with spherical symmetry becomes axial in which by employing a similar refinement of the throat we may construct wormholes with a positive total energy .",
    "it is our belief that by this method of suitable choice of geometry at the throat and in a special frame we can measure a positive energy .",
    "recently we have shown @xcite that the flare - out conditions @xcite which were thought to be unquestionable can be reformulated .",
    "we must admit , however , that although geometry change has positive effects on the energy content this does nt guarantee that the resulting wormhole becomes stable .",
    "for the particular case of counter - rotational effects in @xmath7dimensional tsw we have shown that stability conditions are slightly improved @xcite .",
    "that is , when the throat consists of counter - rotating rings in @xmath7dimensions the stability of the resulting tsw becomes stronger .",
    "this result has not been confirmed in @xmath0dimensional tsws yet .",
    "arbitrary angular dependent throat geometries have also been considered by the same token recently in @xmath7dimensions @xcite .",
    "therein a large class of wormholes with non - circular throat shapes are pointed out in which positive energy supports the wormhole . in the same reference",
    "we explain also the distinctions ( if any ) by employing the ordinary time instead of the proper time .",
    "extension of this result to the more realistic @xmath0dimensions makes the aim of the present study .",
    "numerical computation of our chosen ansatzes yield positive total energy , as promised from the outset .",
    "we start with the @xmath0dimensional flat , spherically symmetric line element in which a curved hypersurface is induced to act as our throat s geometry .",
    "such a hypersurface , @xmath8 , has an induced metric satisfying the einstein equations at the junction with the proper conditions , obeying the flare - out conditions .",
    "no doubt , such an ansatz is too general , for this reason they are restricted subsequently .",
    "static case , for instance eliminates time dependence in @xmath9 .",
    "we derive the general conditions for such throats and present particular anzatses depending on @xmath1 and @xmath2 angles alone that satisfy our constraint conditions .",
    "organization of the paper goes as follows . in section",
    "ii we present in brief the formalism for tsws .",
    "static tsws follow in section iii where angular dependent constraint conditions are derived .",
    "( the details of computations can be found in appendixes a and b ) .",
    "the paper ends with our conclusion in section iv .",
    "we start with a @xmath0dimensional flat spacetime in spherical coordinates @xmath10and introduce a closed hypersurface defined by@xmath11such that the original spacetime is divided into two parts which will form the inside and outside of the given hypersurface in ( 2 ) .",
    "now , we get two copies of the outside manifold and glue them at the hypersurface @xmath12 what is constructed by this procedure is a complete manifold and as had been introduced first by m. visser it is called a thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) whose throat turns out to be the closed hypersurface @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "let s choose @xmath14 for the @xmath0dimensional spacetime and @xmath15 for the @xmath7dimensional hypersurface @xmath16 .",
    "the induced metric tensor of the hypersurface @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18which yields@xmath19note that our notation @xmath20 means partial derivative with respect to @xmath21 next , we apply the einstein equations on the shell , also called the israel junction conditions @xcite which are@xmath22where @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 are the extrinsic curvatures of the hypersurface in either sides .",
    "@xmath26 is the energy momentum tensor on the shell with the components @xmath27where @xmath4 is the energy density on the surface and @xmath26 are the appropriate energy - momentum flux and momentum densities , respectively .",
    "our explicit calculations reveal ( see appendix a ) @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30@xmath31@xmath32and@xmath33 in appendix b we give the mixed tensor @xmath34 in closed forms which are also used to determine explicit expressions for the energy momentum tensor .",
    "using the general formalism given above and in the appendixes a and b we may consider some specific cases .",
    "first of all we consider the case in which the throat is static .",
    "this means @xmath35 and consequently the line element on the shell / tsw becomes@xmath36the non - zero components of the effective extrinsic curvature tensor are then given as@xmath37@xmath38and@xmath39finally in static configuration , one finds@xmath40@xmath41and@xmath42we note that for the static tsw we have@xmath43and@xmath44having the exact form of @xmath45 , we find the total energy which supports the static tsw .",
    "this can be done by using the following integral@xmath46which becomes@xmath47upon using the property of the dirac delta function @xmath48 . to make this energy positive we have to consider an appropriate function for @xmath49 and calculate the total energy @xmath50 particular cases of @xmath51",
    "are considered in the sequel .",
    "[ [ mathcalrleft - protecttheta - protectvarphi - right - function - of - protecttheta - only ] ]      let s make the simpler choice by considering @xmath54 following this one gets @xmath55where the only non - zero components of the extrinsic curvature are@xmath56and@xmath57consequently,@xmath58@xmath59and@xmath60one must note that @xmath61 is the hypersurface of the throat , therefore @xmath62 must be chosen such that the surface remains closed .",
    "for instance , if we set @xmath63 then the throat will be a spherical shell of radius @xmath64 and @xmath65 which is clearly negative and so is @xmath50 picking more complicated functions periodic in @xmath1 is acceptable provided it makes the total energy positive . here",
    ", having @xmath66 is a sufficient condition to have @xmath67 but not necessary .",
    "our main purpose as we stated in the introduction is to show that there is possibility of having a tsw supported by ordinary matter in the sense that @xmath68 this condition effectively reduces to@xmath69at this stage we shall not purse for a @xmath62 that satisfies this condition .      as in the previous section ,",
    "here we consider @xmath71 which yields@xmath72if we set @xmath73 then @xmath74 once more as it should be .",
    "it is observed that even with @xmath75 the energy density @xmath45 is a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath76 in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath77which implies that @xmath78 everywhere .",
    "this is what we were looking for , at least in this stage .",
    "we also note that the total energy through a numerical computation ( given by eq .",
    "( 23 ) ) is finite , and more importantly , positive i.e. , @xmath79 this shows that the turning / critical points on the throat do not demand infinite energy and therefore the model can be physically acceptable .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of 2 + 1-dimensional studied in @xcite .     which admits the energy density on the shell positive everywhere .",
    "the right figure is the opening of the left which shows that the surface is concave out everywhere .",
    "it should be added that the sharp edges can be smoothed at the expense of adding negative energy .",
    "since we refrain doing this we have to face differentiability problem at those edges .",
    "we note that the total energy is finite in these sharp edges .",
    ", width=302 ]      now , we state the most general condition which is provided by a general periodic function for @xmath80 as a matter of fact , in ( 17 ) we gave in closed form such a @xmath45 and what is left is to provide a proper function for @xmath81 such that @xmath82 fig .",
    "2 is a typical example which admits the energy density @xmath45 positive . in this figure",
    "we set@xmath83which is dependent on both of the spherical angles . as in fig .",
    "1 , our numerical calculation reveals that the total energy calculated by eq .",
    "( 23 ) is finite and positive i.e. , @xmath84 this shows that the edges of the throat are made of a finite amount of energy which is desired in a physical model .     in spherical coordinate system .",
    "this specific form of throat provides the energy density positive on the throat .",
    "similar problems raised about sharp edges in caption of fig .",
    "1 are valid also here . the total energy which supports the throat is finite and positive",
    "even at the sharp edges energy does not diverge.,width=302 ]      in @xcite we have shown that for the tsw in @xmath0dimensions , @xmath85 relates to the trace of extrinsic curvature of spatial part of the gaussian line element which amounts to @xmath86therefore for @xmath87 the spatial extrinsic curvature must be negative , that is why for a positive curvature shape such as a sphere @xmath85 is negative .",
    "we note that an open surface with negative curvature can not be also an answer to our demand , because the throat of a tsw is defined to be closed . to show that such shapes i.e. , negatively curved but closed , exist",
    ", we refer to , for instance , a concave dodecahedron .",
    "this is defined as a surface whose faces are concave individually , like the cellular surface of a soccer ball with inside pressure less than outside . in such shapes , although the surface is closed , it consists of negatively curved individual patches in geometry with anti - de sitter spacetime and hence makes @xmath88 similar argument is also valid in @xmath7dimensions which we have considered in @xcite .",
    "the throat geometry for tsws is taken embedded in @xmath0dimensional flat geometry in spherical coordinates .",
    "for static case we obtain the most general angular dependent constraints the functions have to satisfy in order to yield a positive total energy .",
    "we must admit that the positivity condition refers to a static frame in which the energy density becomes positive although the nec remains violated .",
    "specific reduction procedures are given dependent on both @xmath89 and @xmath1 and @xmath2 , that simplify the constraint conditions .",
    "once these constraint conditions are satisfied we shall not be destined to confront exotic matter in tsws .",
    "at least in particular , static frames two particular examples are given which yield positive total energy @xmath90 , from eq .",
    "we admit also that finding analytically general integrals for functions to satisfy our differential equation constraints does nt seem an easy task at all .",
    "the details of our technical part are given in appendix .",
    "the argument / method can naturally be extended to cover more general wormholes , not only the tsws .",
    "one issue that remains open , in all this endeavor which we have not discussed , is the stability of such constructions . a final warning to the traveller who intends to cross the throat : the thin edges may give harmful tidal effects from geometrical point of view , so keep away from those edges if you dream to enjoy a journey at all .",
    "to find the induced extrinsic curvature tensor on @xmath91 we find the unit four - normal vector defined as@xmath92 in which @xmath93and @xmath94 reefers to the inward and outward directions on the sides of the hypersurface .",
