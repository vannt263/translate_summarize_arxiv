    "the discovery of an unexpected diminution in the observed energy fluxes coming from supernovae type ia @xcite , which are thought of as standard candles , has been interpreted in the context of the standard cosmological model as evidence for an accelerating universe dominated by something called dark energy .",
    "this fact is one of the most puzzling and deepest problems in cosmology and fundamental physics today .",
    "although the cosmological constant seems to be the simplest explanation for the phenomenon , several dynamical scenarios have been tried out ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the evidence for an accelerating universe mainly relies on energy flux measurements for type ia supernovae at different values of cosmological redshifts .",
    "they provide the most direct and consistent way to determine the recent expansion history of the universe .",
    "nevertheless the relation between the cosmological redshift and the energy flux for a point - like source involves not only the evolution of the universe during the light journey but some assumptions about the nature of the light itself .",
    "customarily , one accepts the linear maxwell theory to describe the light propagation , where light propagates without interacting with other electric or magnetic fields .",
    "however , in the context of non - linear electrodynamics the interaction between the light emitted from such distant sources and cosmological magnetic backgrounds modifies the relation between the redshift and the flux of energy .",
    "if this kind of effect were not correctly interpreted it could lead to an erroneous conclusion about the expansion history of the universe . concretely",
    ", an effect coming from non - linear electrodynamics could explain the curves of luminosity distance vs redshift for type ia supernovae without invoking dark energy .",
    "this remark drives us to study the propagation of non - linear electromagnetic waves in an expanding universe with a magnetic background",
    ". we will benefit from recently obtained results for born - infeld electromagnetic plane waves propagating in a magnetic uniform background in minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite is a non - linear theory for the electromagnetic field @xmath0 governed by the lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a new fundamental constant and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the scalar and pseudoscalar field invariants @xmath5 ( in minkowski space - time it is @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the electric and magnetic fields respectively ) .",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics goes to maxwell electromagnetism when @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the born - infeld field of a point - like charge reaches the finite value @xmath2 at the charge position and becomes coulombian far from the charge .",
    "born - infeld theory is the only non - linear spin 1 field theory displaying causal propagation and absence of birefringence @xcite .",
    "nowadays , born - infeld theory is reborn in the context of superstrings because born - infeld - like lagrangians emerge in the low energy limit of string theories @xcite .",
    "born - infeld - like lagrangians have been also proposed to describe a matter dynamics able to drive the universe to an accelerated expansion @xcite . in spite of this revival of born - infeld s ideas , there is no experimental evidence for born - infeld effects in electrodynamics : the value of @xmath2 remains unknown ( see an upper bound for @xmath2 in @xcite ) .    in the next section",
    "we will summarize the recently obtained results on born - infeld waves propagating in minkowski space - time in the presence of a uniform magnetic background @xcite .",
    "these results properly adapted will be used in section iii to understand the born - infeld energy flux coming from a point - like source in a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) expanding universe . in section iv we will reformulate the relation between the luminosity distance @xmath11 and the redshift @xmath12 within the framework of born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "we will show that the presence of magnetic backgrounds modify the curves @xmath11 vs @xmath12 , and we will analyze the consequences for the measurements of the luminosity distance of supernovae type ia .",
    "free born - infeld electromagnetic plane waves do not differ from maxwell plane waves . however , if the wave propagates in the presence of background fields then the propagation velocity becomes lower than @xmath13 as a consequence of the non - linearity of the theory .",
    "this issue has been studied in @xcite by considering the propagation of discontinuities .",
    "recently the exact solution for a born - infeld electromagnetic plane wave propagating in a static uniform magnetic background has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the result retrieves the value for the phase velocity obtained in the above mentioned references : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the background field and @xmath16 is its component along the propagation direction .",
    "furthermore , the results of @xcite exhibit an up to now unknown feature : the wave develops a longitudinal electric field which depends on @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the projection of the background field @xmath18 on the polarization direction ) .",
    "in fact , the total electric and magnetic fields result @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( usual ) transversal electric field of the wave , and @xmath21 is its phase . the longitudinal electric field of the wave is @xmath22 ( of course @xmath23 vanishes when @xmath24 ) . as a consequence ,",

    ". we will use ( [ conservacion ] ) to study electromagnetic waves propagating in a magnetic background ; so , @xmath46 in ( [ conservacion ] ) includes both the wave and the background fields . in maxwell electromagnetism",
    "the trace @xmath47 is identically null . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath48 solves ( [ conservacion ] ) in minkowski space - time ( @xmath49 ) then @xmath50 will solve ( [ conservacion ] ) in the spatially flat frw universe .",
    "since maxwell energy - momentum tensor is quadratic in the fields , the former assertion means that the maxwell fields scale with the factor @xmath51 .",
    "this general conclusion is applicable to the particular case of a wave propagating in a magnetic background .    on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath47 is non - null in born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "thus , the scaling of @xmath52 with the factor @xmath53 does not guarantee the fulfillment of ( [ conservacion ] ) .",
    "an additional correction is needed , which must vanish in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "we will search this correction to the lowest order in @xmath54 for the born - infeld plane wave propagating in a magnetic background , whose main features were depicted in section ii .",
    "of course , we will assume that the magnetic background do not sensitively affects the homogeneity and isotropy of the space - time dominated by matter and ( presumably ) dark energy , because the energy density of the background field is negligible compared with matter and cosmological constant densities ( a typical value for this field is @xmath55 ) .",
    "since we are going to consider the lowest order correction in @xmath54 for the magnitudes described in section ii such as ( [ elong ] ) , ( [ poynting1 ] ) , ( [ poynting2 ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , we remark that any magnitude of this order or bigger will only require the maxwellian scaling of the fields with the factor @xmath51 . in the case of the propagation velocity ( [ beta ] ) the correction can also be obtained from the results in @xcite , where it is shown that the equation accomplished by the wave four - vector can be understood as if the rays propagate along null geodesics of an effective metric @xmath56 . in the case of the born - infeld electrodynamics",
    "the effective metric @xmath56 is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the space - time metric and @xmath59 is the electromagnetic background where the ray propagates , in this case the components of the background are ,    @xmath60    for a ray propagating along the @xmath61 direction it is @xmath62 when the effective metric ( [ geomef ] ) is evaluated for the magnetic background ( [ campob ] ) it results @xmath63 thus , it is obtained @xmath64 by integrating the ray path in ( [ geoefe ] ) we recognize that the phase @xmath65 has to be replaced with @xmath66 ( compare with the adiabatic treatment for an oscillator with slowly variable frequency @xcite ) . notice that , since @xmath67 and @xmath68 as in minkowski space - time , then the derivatives of @xmath69 in ( [ conservacion ] ) will preserve their minkowskian structure .",
    "the trace of the born - infeld energy - momentum tensor is ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath70=\\frac{s^2+p^2}{2\\pi\\ , b^2}+{\\cal o}(b^{-4 } ) \\label{trace}\\ ] ] and scales with @xmath71 .",
    "let us consider a solution @xmath48 for the born - infeld field in minkowski space - time ; i.e. , @xmath72 ( for the case under consideration , @xmath73 is the energy density ( [ rho ] ) , and @xmath74 are the components of the poynting vector ( [ poynting1]-[poynting2 ] ) ) . as stated above",
    ", the scaling of the fields with @xmath51 is not enough to get a solution for ( [ conservacion ] ) , since the term associated with the trace is now non - null .",
    "as the trace is of order @xmath54 , only @xmath52 has to be corrected in ( [ conservacion ] ) .",
    "so , let us try with the scaling @xmath75 . by replacing in ( [ conservacion ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath76 therefore @xmath77 since the trace is of order @xmath54 , then @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath78 can be computed with the maxwellian fields . the time averaged trace for a plane wave traveling in a magnetic background is @xcite @xmath79 thus @xmath80 results @xmath81",
    "according to the results of previous section , we should correct the minkowskian poynting vector ( [ poynting1 ] ) , ( [ poynting2 ] ) with the factor @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "thus the energy flux along the propagation direction is @xmath83\\ + \\ { \\cal o}(b^{-4})\\\\ = \\ \\left(1-\\frac{\\delta_b}{a(\\eta)^4\\ , b^2}\\right)\\frac{e_o^2}{8\\ , \\pi\\ , a(\\eta)^4}\\ + \\ { \\cal o}(b^{-4 } ) \\label{poyntingfrw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is positive .",
    "actually we are interested in light rays emitted from point - like sources in the universe . when a light ray travels in the intergalactic space , it undergoes a background magnetic field in different regions of the traveled path . in such case , the values of @xmath85 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    "implied in the propagation should be taken as representative values of the intergalactic background field along the ray trajectory ; so @xmath86 is a magnitude of the same order as the representative squared intergalactic field .    for a radial propagation",
    "the minkowskian spherical energy flux is obtained from the plane flux by dividing by the square of the radial distance to the source @xmath87 . therefore the radial energy flux in a frw",
    "spatially flat universe becomes @xmath88 in maxwell electrodynamics the background field does not interfere with the wave , but in non - linear born - infeld electrodynamics the first correction in ( [ tetarpro ] ) displays a coupling between the wave and the background magnetic field .",
    "the luminosity of an object results from integrating the flux at the time of emision @xmath89 , this integration normalizes @xmath90 to fit the value of the luminosity @xmath91 . by using ( [ tetarpro ] ) one obtains @xmath92 combining ( [ tetarpro ] ) and ( [ lum2 ] ) the energy flux can be written as @xmath93\\ ] ] the luminosity distance @xmath11 is defined as ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the flux measured at time @xmath96 at the position of the observer @xmath97 ( the source is at @xmath98 ) .",
