    "this is just massive quenched qcd ( @xmath53 ) at finite chemical potential , which has a transition at @xmath54 which is no longer zero . since we expect that @xmath55 we have not completely solved the problem .",

    ", we will move to larger lattices , and also perform some simulations at non - zero quark mass .",
    "the next stage will involve using a more physical chiral group ( @xmath59 ? ? ) .",
    "auxiliary fields and constituent quark masses give promise of an effective lagrangian interpretation of @xmath1qcd .",
