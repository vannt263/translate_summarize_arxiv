    "it is well known that the universe could have undergone several phase transitions in the early stages of its history , most of them associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of some symmetry .",
    "some examples are the quark - hadron phase transition at the qcd scale , the phase transitions associated to the electroweak @xmath0 symmetry breaking or to grand unified theories , and the peccei - quinn phase transition , related to the axion field and the strong cp problem .",
    "cosmological phase transitions generically produce cosmic relics , such as topological defects , magnetic fields , or baryon number asymmetries , with potentially important cosmological consequences . the mechanisms for generating these relics build on the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "in a first - order phase transition the dynamics is essentially determined by the nucleation and expansion of bubbles . at zero temperature , when a true vacuum bubble nucleates , it rapidly begins to expand with almost the velocity of light @xcite . on the contrary , at high temperature ,",
    "the bubble expands in a hot plasma , which is perturbed by the motion of the bubble walls .",
    "the plasma thus opposes a resistance to the expansion , that depends on the wall velocity . as a consequence ,",
    "bubble walls feel a friction force , which prevents them to accelerate indefinitely .",
    "then , the velocity quickly reaches a stationary value , determined by the viscosity of the plasma and the pressure difference between the low temperature phase and the supercooled one .",
    "these quantities depend on the model , and it is known that the friction can be large enough to prevent the wall from acquiring relativistic velocities @xcite . furthermore , the release of latent heat at the interfaces of the phase transition reheats the surrounding plasma up to a temperature that in most cases is close to the critical temperature .",
    "consequently , the pressure difference that drives bubble expansion may decrease considerably , causing a drastic slowdown of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the radiation dominated era bubble walls generically undergo non - relativistic motion .",
    "since the heat liberated at the interfaces is taken away by sound waves , the temperature can be assumed to be homogeneous , which simplifies the analysis .    in order to have a first - order phase transition",
    ", the free energy must allow the coexistence of two phases .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the free energy density @xmath1 depends on some order parameter ( usually a higgs field ) @xmath2 .",
    "in a certain range of temperatures , the free energy bears two minima separated by a barrier ; one of them at @xmath3 , which corresponds to the symmetric phase , and the other at a nonzero value @xmath4 , corresponding to the broken symmetry phase . the difference in free energy density @xmath5 between some value @xmath6 of the order parameter and @xmath3 ,",
    "is generally given by a finite - temperature effective potential .",
    "the free energy difference between the two minima is thus given by @xmath7 at the critical temperature the two minima are degenerate , @xmath8 .",
    "above the critical temperature the symmetric phase is the stable one , while below @xmath9 it becomes metastable , being @xmath10 the absolute minimum .",
    "finally , at some temperature @xmath11 , the barrier between the minima disappears , and the symmetric phase becomes unstable . at some stage between the temperatures @xmath9 and @xmath12 , bubbles of broken - symmetry phase will be formed in the sea of symmetric phase .",
    "a bubble can be described as a configuration in which the order parameter is non - vanishing inside a spherical region ( see e.g. @xcite ) . after being nucleated",
    ", a bubble will grow with a velocity that depends on the pressure difference at the interface , @xmath13 , and on the viscosity of the hot plasma in which it expands .",
    "in this work we will be concerned with first - order phase transitions in the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "our aim is to study the development of such phase transitions within a completely analytical approach .",
    "here we concentrate on the determination of the parameters that govern relic formation ( e.g. number density of bubbles , bubble wall velocity , etc . ) .",
    "an analytic study of cosmological consequences will be addressed in @xcite , where the results of the present analysis will be used . in section [ remnants ]",
    "we briefly review the influence of phase transition dynamics on the mechanisms for generating cosmic remnants in first - order phase transitions .",
    "in section [ phaseeq ] we study a phase transition that completely develops at @xmath14 , with the two phases in equilibrium .",
    "this is a good approximation in the case of inhomogeneous nucleation in the presence of impurities . in the case of homogeneous nucleation of bubbles ,",
    "this approximation correctly describes the evolution of the phase transition after some latent heat has been released .",
    "an interesting feature of phase equilibrium is that it is simple enough to solve analytically , including back - reaction on the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is due to the fact that temperature is constant all the way through the phase transition .",
    "we thus can obtain the fraction of volume of the universe that is occupied by the low - temperature phase as a function of time , with no need of any numerical calculations .",
    "section [ superc ] is devoted to the analysis of the phase transition in the case of homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the main difference with the previous case is the initial stage of supercooling and quick reheating back to the critical temperature .",
    "section [ transicion ] contains an analytical study of the phase transition dynamics . in sections [ physquant ] and [ perturb ]",

    "several cosmological objects may be formed in a phase transition of the universe .",
    "their abundance and characteristics depend on details of the development of the phase transition . due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which these objects are created and the difficulty of describing the phase transition , several details of the dynamics ( e.g. the variation of the nucleation rate or the wall velocity during the transition ) are often disregarded for the sake of simplicity .",
    "an analytical study of the phase transition is thus important since analytical expressions will help taking into account the dynamics in a more rigorous way . in this section",

    "[ [ electroweak - baryogenesis . ] ] electroweak baryogenesis .    during the last two decades",
    "there has been much interest in the possibility that the electroweak phase transition could be the framework for the generation of the baryon number asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "a first - order electroweak phase transition provides the three sakharov s conditions for the generation of a bau , although physics beyond the minimal standard model ( sm ) is mandatory in order to obtain a quantitatively satisfactory result ( for reviews on electroweak baryogenesis see @xcite ) . due to @xmath15 violating interactions of particles with the bubble walls , an asymmetry between left handed quarks and their antiparticles",
    "is generated in front of the walls of expanding bubbles .",
    "this asymmetry biases the baryon number violating sphaleron processes in the symmetric phase .",
    "the resulting baryon asymmetry is caught by the walls and enter the bubbles , where baryon number violating processes are turned off .",
    "it is important that the sphaleron processes be suppressed in the broken symmetry phase , in order to avoid the washout of the generated bau when equilibrium is established after the phase transition .",
    "this requirement imposes a condition on the value of the higgs field at the temperature of the transition @xcite , @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath17 is the order parameter , this is a condition on the strength of the first - order phase transition .",
    "the resulting bau depends also on the bubble wall velocity . on one hand ,",
    "if the velocity is too large , the left - handed density perturbation will pass so quickly through a given point in space that sphaleron processes will not have enough time to produce baryons ; thus the resulting bau will be small . on the other hand , for very small velocities thermal equilibrium will be restored and the baryon asymmetry will be erased by sphalerons ; thus the bau will be small again . as a consequence , the generated baryon number will have a peak at a given wall velocity , which is of order @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "both values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 depend on @xmath20 and vary during the phase transition .",
    "the dependence of the wall velocity is more critical , since reheating may cause it to descend two orders of magnitude before the transition completes .",
    "baryogenesis may be either enhanced or suppressed by this effect @xcite , depending on which side of the peak the initial velocity lies .",
    "[ [ baryon - inhomogeneities . ] ] baryon inhomogeneities .",
    "a general feature of cosmological phase transitions is the difference of particle masses between the high- and low - temperature phases .",
    "these mass differences give rise to different number densities in the two phases . at the qcd phase transition ,",
    "for instance , baryons are much heavier in the hadron phase than in the deconfined quark phase .",
    "as the hadron phase expands , baryons are pushed into the quark phase region , leading to localized clumps of high density surrounded by large voids of low baryon density @xcite .",
    "an important consequence is that large amplitude , small scale density fluctuations may survive until the nucleosynthesis epoch , affecting the standard scenario of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore , inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis may put constraints on the quark - hadron phase transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if the quark phase reaches sufficiently high density , its pressure may balance that of the hadron phase .",
    "the quark matter trapped in small regions of space forms quark plasma objects that may survive until the present epoch @xcite .",
    "baryon inhomogeneities may also arise at the electroweak phase transition , since the amount of baryons produced through electroweak baryogenesis depends drastically on the wall velocity , and the latter has a considerable variation during the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the electroweak inhomogeneities is in general quite different from the qcd case .",
    "if the bau peaks at a certain wall velocity , then the high density regions will form spherical walls , whose radius depends on the moment in the bubble evolution at which the peak velocity is attained .",
    "furthermore , baryon number densities with the wrong sign may arise in some regions of space , depending on the baryogenesis scenario @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the interesting possibility of nucleosynthesis in the presence of antibaryons ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to baryon diffusion and  neutrino inflation \" , baryon inhomogeneities generated at the electroweak phase transition hardly survive until the nucleosynthesis time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , they may survive until the qcd scale .",
    "in that case , electroweak scale inhomogeneities can act as impurities for the quark - hadron phase transition ( see next section ) .    in summary",
    ", we can say that the amplitude and scale of baryon inhomogeneities generically depend on the mean nucleation distance and on the variation of the velocity of bubble expansion .",
    "[ [ topological - defects - and - magnetic - fields . ] ] topological defects and magnetic fields .",
    "if a global @xmath21 symmetry is spontaneously broken at a first - order phase transition , the phase angle @xmath22 of the higgs field within each nucleated bubble is essentially constant , but phases in different bubbles are uncorrelated . when bubbles collide , the discontinuity in the higgs phase is smoothed out to become a continuous variation .",
    "the so called `` geodesic rule '' states that ( for energetic reasons ) the shortest path between the two phases is chosen @xcite .",
    "when three bubbles meet , a vortex ( in two spatial dimensions ) or a string ( in 3d ) may be trapped between them .",
    "this mechanism is obviously generalized to higher symmetry groups and other kinds of topological defects . ignoring the dynamics of phase equilibration",
    ", it is easy to see that the number density of defects is proportional to the number density of bubbles .",
    "however , the final number of defects will depend strongly on the velocity of bubble expansion @xcite .",
    "if the latter is much less than the velocity of light , then phase equilibration between two bubbles will have probably completed before they encounter a third bubble , thus reducing the chances of trapping a string .",
    "the above picture is in fact a rough simplification of the defect - formation problem .",
    "one complication is due to dissipation , since the higgs field is coupled to the other fields in the thermal bath .",
    "another complication arises when considering a gauge symmetry , and is caused by the fact that the phase of the higgs field is not a gauge - invariant quantity , so it is convenient to define a gauge - invariant phase difference between two bubbles @xcite .",
    "the phase difference is thus linked to the gauge field . in this case",
    ", dissipation can be taken into account by introducing the conductivity of the plasma .",
    "then one can model the collision of three bubbles and calculate the evolution of the phase difference and gauge field .",
    "one can say that a vortex is formed whenever a quantum of magnetic flux is trapped in the unbroken - symmetry region between the three bubbles",
    ".    from the above it is clear that the formation of local vortices is associated with the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "therefore bubble collision constitutes also a mechanism for generating the cosmic magnetic fields ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the magnetic field that is formed in this way corresponds to a spontaneously - broken symmetry which can not be the electromagnetic @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , this mechanism can take place at the electroweak phase transition , where unstable cosmic strings and hypermagnetic fields may be formed .",
    "the latter are subsequently converted to @xmath23 magnetic fields .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence of magnetic fields may affect the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    calculating the magnitude of the magnetic fields and the density of defects that are left at the end of",
    "the phase transition involves the passage from three - bubble collision simulations to the computation of the full phase transition .",
    "evidently , this is a difficult task .",
    "although some simulations have been made ( e.g. , @xcite ) , several simplifications are generally required , which include forgetting about variations in the nucleation rate and the velocity of expansion of bubbles during the transition .",
    "an analytical investigation of phase transition dynamics may therefore clarify the picture and provide useful tools for the calculation of defect formation and magnetic field generation .",
    "we begin by considering the limiting case in which the first - order phase transition is as slowest as possible , namely , that of coexistence of the high- and low - temperature phases at the critical temperature @xmath9 .",
    "such a cosmic separation of phases has been studied for the qcd phase transition @xcite . at the critical temperature",
    "there is no pressure difference between phases at the bubble walls , so the bubble expansion takes place almost in equilibrium .",
    "assume at @xmath24 there are already regions with low - temperature phase . as the universe expands , the fraction of space occupied by these regions increases , as the high - temperature phase converts to low - temperature phase .",
    "the loss of energy due to the expansion of the universe is thus compensated by the latent heat released at the interfaces , and the temperature remains constant . in this scenario",
    "there is no supercooling .",
    "since at @xmath9 the nucleation rate vanishes , such a first - order phase transition is only possible in the presence of impurities that induce the formation of bubbles . in this case inhomogeneous nucleation theory applies . in a phase transition mediated by impurities",
    "there will still be some supercooling , which we neglect in this section for simplicity .",
    "the role of impurities in the early universe could be played for instance by topological @xcite or non - topological solitons @xcite .",
    "these may exist in the high - temperature phase , containing the low - temperature phase in their core . in this case",
    "their configurations become unstable or metastable below the critical temperature .",
    "when the system cools below @xmath9 these objects begin to expand and convert the universe into the true vacuum .",
    "another example of inhomogeneous nucleation is the case of the qcd phase transition in the presence of baryon number inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "these may arise as a natural consequence of electroweak baryogenesis @xcite , and can survive until the qcd scale @xcite . since the critical temperature is different in regions with different chemical potential @xcite , bubbles will nucleate first in those regions with a higher @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if such regions are relatively small , and if they achieve the necessary amount of supercooling while the surrounding background reaches the critical temperature , then the baryon inhomogeneities operate as impurities for inhomogeneous nucleation .    even if the phase transition proceeds by homogeneous nucleation of bubbles , phase equilibrium will describe quite well a good part of the transition , whenever the latent heat is at least comparable to the energy density difference between the critical temperature and that at which nucleation effectively begins . in that case , the energy released will reheat the plasma back to a temperature very close to @xmath9 . at that moment bubble nucleation",
    "virtually stops and the two phases remain close to equilibrium until the full latent heat of the transition is eliminated",
    ". we will analyze this case in the next section .",
    "the customary equation for the adiabatic expansion , @xmath25 , tells us how the universe takes energy from the hot plasma . here",
    "@xmath26 is the energy density , @xmath27 is the pressure , and @xmath28 is the expansion rate",
    ". it can be equivalently written in terms of entropy density , @xmath29 , which is just the statement of entropy conservation , @xmath30 .",
    "it will be convenient to use it in the form @xmath31 . at the beginning of the phase transition",
    "the whole universe is in the symmetric phase , while at the end of the transition it is filled with the broken symmetry one , so we can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the entropy density of the unbroken ( broken ) symmetry phase , @xmath34 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath35 its value at the beginning ( end ) of the transition .",
    "we assume that , since the phase transition occurs very slowly , the latent heat released at the interfaces is quickly distributed throughout space and the temperature is homogeneous .",
    "we also assume that pressure and temperature remain constant during the phase transition .",
    "phase coexistence at @xmath14 means that there are regions of space with different equations of state .",
    "thus the entropy density has different constant values @xmath36 and @xmath37 inside and outside the bubbles of broken symmetry phase respectively . the quantity @xmath38 in eq .",

    "<S> we consider first - order phase transitions of the universe in the radiation - dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in general the velocity of interfaces is non - relativistic due to the interaction with the plasma and the release of latent heat . </S>",
    "<S> we study the general evolution of such slow phase transitions , which comprise essentially a short reheating stage and a longer phase equilibrium stage . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a completely analytical description of both stages . </S>",
    "<S> some rough approximations are needed for the first stage , due to the non - trivial relations between the quantities that determine the variation of temperature with time . </S>",
    "<S> the second stage , instead , is considerably simplified by the fact that it develops at a constant temperature , close to the critical one . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in this case the equations can be solved exactly , including back - reaction on the expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this treatment also applies to phase transitions mediated by impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the relations between the different parameters that govern the characteristics of the phase transition and its cosmological consequences , and discuss the dependence of these parameters with the particle content of the theory . </S>"
