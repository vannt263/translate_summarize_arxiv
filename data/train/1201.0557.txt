    "the constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) is a generic problem in computer science .",
    "an instance consists of a number of variables and constraints imposed on them and the objective is to determine whether variables can be assigned values in such a way that all the constraints are met .",
    "as csp provides a common framework for many theoretical problems as well as for many real - life applications , it has been studied by computer scientists for over forty years .",
    "the results contained in this paper follow a long line of research devoted to verifying the constraint satisfaction problem dichotomy conjecture of feder and vardi  @xcite .",
    "it deals with so called _ non - uniform _ csp  the same decision problem as the ordinary csp , but in this case the set of allowed constraint relations is finite and fixed .",
    "the conjecture states that , for every finite , fixed set of constraint relations  ( a fixed _ template _ ) , the csp defined by it is np - complete or solvable in polynomial time , i.e. the class of csps exhibits a dichotomy .",
    "the conjecture of feder and vardi dates back to 1993 . at that time",
    "it was supported by two major results , schaefer s dichotomy theorem for two  element templates @xcite , and the dichotomy theorem for undirected graphs by hell and neetil @xcite . the first breakthrough in the research appeared in 1997 in the work of jeavons , cohen and gyssens  @xcite , refined later by bulatov , jeavons and krokhin  @xcite . at heart of the new approach",
    "lies a proof that the complexity of csp , for a fixed template , depends only on a set of certain operations  polymorphisms of the template .",
    "thus the study of templates gives rise to the study of algebras associated to them .",
    "the algebraic approach has lead to a better understanding of the known results and brought a number of new results which were out of reach for pre - algebraic methods .",
    "the theorem of schaefer  @xcite has been extended by bulatov  @xcite to three  element domains .",
    "another major result of bulatov  @xcite establishes the dichotomy for templates containing all unary relations .",
    "the conjecture of bang - jensen and hell  @xcite , generalizing hell s and neetil s dichotomy theorem @xcite , was confirmed  @xcite .",
    "new algorithms were devised  @xcite and pre - algebraic algorithms were characterized in algebraic terms  @xcite .",
    "the hardness parts in the dichotomy results mentioned above were obtained using a theorem of bulatov , jeavons and krokhin  @xcite stating that whenever an algebra associated with a core template does not lie in a taylor variety then the csp defined by the template is np - complete . in the same paper",
    "the authors conjecture that in all the other cases the associated csp is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "all the known partial results agree with this proposed classification , which is now commonly referred to as the algebraic dichotomy conjecture .    in order to prove the algebraic dichotomy conjecture one has to devise an algorithm that works for any relational structure with the corresponding algebra in a taylor variety .",
    "as the characterization originally provided by taylor  @xcite is difficult to work with , a search for equivalent conditions is ongoing . a technical , but useful condition was obtained by bulatov who used it to prove his dichotomy theorems  @xcite .",
    "another powerful tool is the characterization of ( locally finite ) taylor varieties in terms of weak near - unanimity operations due to mar ' oti and mckenzie  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , their proof uses a deep algebraic theory of hobby and mckenzie  @xcite , therefore is not easily accessible for a nonspecialist .",
    "the proof of the conjecture of bang - jensen and hell hinges on this characterization ; also the algebraic characterization of problems of bounded width  @xcite relies on a similar characterization of congruence meet semi - distributive varieties provided in the same paper  @xcite .",
    "recently , a surprisingly simple condition for taylor varieties was found by siggers  @xcite , and an analytical characterization was given by kun and szegedy  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide two new conditions for ( finitely generated ) taylor varieties .",
    "these new characterizations already proved to be useful .",
    "not only they provide new tools for attacking the algebraic dichotomy conjecture , but they also allow us to present easy and elementary proofs for some of the results mentioned above . moreover , their proofs are self - contained and do not require heavy algebraic machinery .    the first , structural characterization ( the absorption theorem )",
    "is expressed in terms of _ absorbing subalgebras _ developed and successfully applied by the authors in  @xcite .",
    "we use it to present an elementary proof of the conjecture of bang - jensen and hell .",
    "recently , the absorption theorem was applied to give a short proof of bulatov s dichotomy theorem for conservative csps  @xcite .",
    "the second , equational characterization involves _ cyclic terms _ and is a stronger version of the weak near - unanimity condition .",
    "we use it to restate the algebraic dichotomy conjecture in simple combinatorial terms and to provide a very short proof of the theorem of hell and neetil .",
    "the results of this paper also show that the tools developed for the csp can be successfully applied to algebraic questions which indicates a deep connection between the csp and universal algebra .",
    "in section  [ sect : preliminaries ] we introduce the necessary notions concerning algebras and the csp .",
    "in section  [ sect : absorbing ] we define absorbing subalgebras and present the absorption theorem and its corollaries . in section  [",
    "sect : smoothproof ] we use the absorbing subalgebra characterization to provide an elementary proof of the conjecture of bang - jensen and hell in a slightly stronger version which is needed in section  [ sect : cyclic ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : cyclic ] we prove the characterization using cyclic terms and its corollaries : the theorem of hell and neetil  @xcite and the weak near - unanimity characterization of locally finite taylor varieties of marti and mckenzie  @xcite .",
