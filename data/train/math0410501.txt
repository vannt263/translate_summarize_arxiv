    "the busemann - petty problem asks the following question . given two convex origin - symmetric bodies @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath0 such that @xmath6 for every central hyperplane @xmath7 in @xmath0 , does it follow that @xmath8    the answer to this problem in @xmath0 is known to be affirmative if @xmath2 and negative if @xmath3 .",
    "the solution appeared as the result of work of many mathematicians ( see @xcite or @xcite for historical details ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the busemann - petty problem in hyperbolic and spherical spaces in place of the euclidean space .",
    "we prove    let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be centrally symmetric convex bodies in the spherical space @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( more precisely in a hemisphere ) such that @xmath11 for every central totally - geodesic hyperplane @xmath7 in @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 on the other hand , if @xmath3 there are convex symmetric bodies @xmath4 , @xmath14 that satisfy ( [ eqn : condition ] ) but @xmath15    so , the answer to the busemann - petty in @xmath9 is exactly the same as in the euclidean space",
    ". however , the situation in the hyperbolic space is different .",
    "trivially , the answer is affirmative if @xmath16 , since the condition ( [ eqn : condition ] ) in this case is equivalent to @xmath17 , but for higher dimensions we have the following :    there are convex centrally symmetric bodies @xmath4 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 that satisfy the condition @xmath20 for every central totally - geodesic hyperplane @xmath7 in @xmath21 , but @xmath22    the idea to find analogs of known results in non - euclidean spaces is not new .",
    "for example in @xcite the authors study intrinsic volumes in hyperbolic and spherical spaces . the brunn - minkowski inequality in different spaces is discussed in @xcite .",
    "also a number of papers is concerned with other generalizations of the busemann - petty problem . in our proof",
    "we will be using results from @xcite , where a.zvavitch studied the busemann - petty problem for arbitrary measures .",
    "for other generalizations of the busemann - petty problem see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be the unit sphere in @xmath23 . using the stereographic projection ( from the north pole onto the hyperplane containing the equator ) we can think of it as @xmath24 equipped with the metric of constant curvature @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , ... , @xmath28 are the standard euclidean coordinates in @xmath24 .",

    "it is well - known that geodesic lines on the sphere are great circles .",
    "later on , in order to define convexity , we will need the uniqueness property of geodesics joining given 2 points .",
    "but this is not the case on the sphere .",
    "however if we restrict ourselves to an open hemisphere , then for any two points there exists a unique geodesic segment connecting them . under the stereographic projection the open south hemisphere",
    "gets mapped onto the open unit ball @xmath29 in @xmath24 .",
    "this is the model we will be working in .",
    "the geodesics in this model are arcs of the circles intersecting the boundary of the ball @xmath29 in antipodal points and straight lines through the origin .",
    "also it is well - known that the hyperbolic space @xmath21 can be identified with the interior of the unit ball in @xmath24 with the metric :    @xmath30 this is the poincar model of the hyperbolic space in the ball .",
    "note that it can be also obtained from the pseudeosphere in the lorentzian space via the stereographic projection .",
    "the geodesic lines in this model are arcs of the circles orthogonal to the boundary of the ball @xmath29 and straight lines through the origin .",

    "in addition if we consider @xmath34 we get the original case of the euclidean space .",
    "the definition of convexity in hyperbolic and spherical spaces ( recall that we work in an open hemisphere ) is analogous to that in the euclidean space ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter i ,  12 ) ) . a body @xmath4",
    "( compact set with non - empty interior ) is called * convex * if for every pair of points in @xmath4 the geodesic segment joining them also belongs to the body @xmath4 . for our definition of convexity in @xmath9 it",
    "is crucial that we work in an open hemisphere , since in this case we have a unique geodesic segment through any two points .",
    "let @xmath4 be a body in the open unit ball @xmath29 .",
    "in order to distinguish between different types of convexity we will adopt the following system of notations .",
    "the body @xmath4 is called s - convex ( or @xmath25-convex ) , if it is convex in the spherical metric defined in the ball @xmath29 .",
    "similarly it is called h - convex ( or @xmath35-convex ) if it is convex with respect to the hyperbolic metric .",
    "e - convex bodies ( or 0-convex ) are the bodies convex in the usual euclidean sense .",
    "analogously s-(h-,e-)geodesics are the straight lines of the spherical ( hyperbolic , euclidean ) metric .",
