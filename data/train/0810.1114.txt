    "the universal skeletons for coordinate algebras in classical geometry ( differential geometry , algebraic geometry , etc . ) are polynomial algebras .",
    "the appropriate function algebras are obtained by completions with respect to the adapted topologies and either by gluing process or by taking quotient algebras .",
    "+ our aim here is to discuss the noncommutative generalizations of polynomial algebras which can be used similarily in various noncommutative setting , noncommutative differential geometry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , noncommutative algebraic geometry , etc . as well as in the applications in physics .",
    "+ at the very beginning , one has to face the question of what class of algebras should we consider as generalization of the algebras of polynomial functions on finite - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "it seems clear that one must stay within the class of the @xmath0-graded algebras which are connected , generated in degree 1 with finite presentations .",
    "there is a minimal choice which is the class of quadratic algebras which are koszul ( see below ) of finite global dimension , which have polynomial growth and satisfy a version of poincar duality refered to as the gorenstein property in @xcite .",
    "a bigger class is the class of regular algebras in the sense of @xcite which shall be refered to as the class of as - regular algebras in the following .",
    "we shall consider here a bigger class in that we shall drop the condition of polynomial growth included in the as - regularity condition .",
    "we shall refer to this bigger class of algebras as regular algebras .",
    "although polynomial growth is a very natural condition for noncommutative coordinate algebras ( and from the point of view of deformation theory ) , it turns out that for our analysis we do not need it and that by imposing polynomial growth one eliminates algebras which in spite of the fact that they have not an interpretation of ( noncommutative ) coordinate algebra are very interesting and are furthermore relevant for physics . of course , at any stage one can restrict attention to the subclass of algebras with polynomial growth , ( or which are quadratic , etc . ) .",
    "for global dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the regular algebras are @xmath3-homogeneous and koszul .",
    "we shall recall what this koszul property means .",
    "this is a very desirable property that one can formulate only for @xmath3-homogeneous algebras for the moment ( i.e. algebras with relations of degree @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is why , for global dimensions @xmath4 we shall impose @xmath3-homogeneity and koszulity .",
    "+ in the following we shall review various concepts and results .",
    "we shall in particular give a survey of the results of @xcite , @xcite in which we shall insist on the conceptual points and drop technical proofs.we shall illustrate the mains points by a lot of examples .",
    "a central result is that the algebras under consideration are completely specified by multilinear forms on finite - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "given such an algebra , the corresponding multilinear form , which is unique up to a nonvanishing scale factor , plays the role of the ( noncommutative ) volume form .",
    "furthermore isomorphic algebras correspond to multilinear forms which are in the same orbit of the corresponding linear group ( @xmath5 for @xmath6 generators ) .",
    "the determination of the moduli space of these algebras is of course of mathematical interest by itself .",
    "concerning physics , the classification of these algebras can become of great importance since in a noncommutative geometrical approach to the quantum theory of space and gravitation one should expect the occurrence at some approximation of a superposition of noncommutative geometries . + it is worth noticing that the results of @xcite have been recently generalized to the quiver case in @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between @xcite and @xcite should read : multilinear forms or volumes @xmath7 superpotentials .",
    "+ finally one should point out that this article is not only a survey but that it also contains new results and concepts .",
    "+ let us give some indications on the notations",
    ". throughout the paper @xmath8 denotes a field , all vector spaces and algebras are over @xmath8 , the dual of a vector space @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 and the symbol @xmath11 denotes the tensor product over @xmath8 . without other specifications ,",
    "an algebra will always be an associative unital algebra .",
    "a graded algebra will be a @xmath0-graded algebra @xmath12 .",
    "such a graded algebra is said to be connected whenever @xmath13 . given a @xmath14-matrix @xmath15 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath16 its transposed @xmath17-matrix .",
    "we use the einstein summation convention of repeated up down indices in the formulas .",
    "the aim of this section is to make explicit the general class of algebras that we wish to investigate and to set up some notations .      the algebras that we shall consider",
    "will be connected @xmath0-graded algebras which are finitely generated in degree 1 and finitely presented with homogeneous relations of degrees @xmath18 .",
    "these algebras are the objects of the category @xmath19 , the morphisms of this category being the homogeneous algebra homomorphisms of degree 0 . + an algebra @xmath20 is of the form @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 is finite - dimensional , @xmath23 a finite - dimensional graded subspace of @xmath24 such that ( independence ) @xmath25=\\{0\\}\\ ] ] for any @xmath26 @xmath27 for @xmath28 and where @xmath29 $ ] denotes for any subset @xmath30 the two - sided ideal generated by @xmath31 .",

    "the @xmath3-homogeneous algebras form a full subcategory @xmath42 of @xmath19 , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 be as above so @xmath44 $ ] and one can define @xmath45 by setting @xmath46 .",
    "then the presentation of @xmath33 by generators and relations is equivalent to the exactness of the sequence of left @xmath33-modules @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 means right multiplication ( in @xmath33 ) by the matrix @xmath49 , @xmath50 means right multiplication by the column @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the projection onto @xmath53 . in more intrinsic notations",
    "the exact sequence ( [ pr ] ) reads for @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the multiplication of @xmath33 and the first arrow is as in ( [ pr ] ) . the exact sequence ( [ pr ] ) corresponding to the presentation of @xmath33 extends as a minimal projective resolution @xmath57 of the left @xmath33-module @xmath8 which is in fact a free resolution @xcite @xmath58 and it follows from the very definition of @xmath59 that one can make the identifications @xmath60 which read @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the yoneda algebra @xmath59 is the cohomology of a graded differential algebra from which it follows that it carries a canonical @xmath65-structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that one can reconstruct the graded algebra @xmath33 from the @xmath65-algebra @xmath66 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath65-algebra @xmath66 is a natural dual of the graded algebra @xmath33 . in the case of a @xmath3-homogeneous algebra @xmath33",
    ", there is another natural dual of @xmath33 which is its koszul dual @xmath67 @xcite ( see below ) . in the case of a koszul algebra",
    "these two notions are strongly connected and coincide in the quadratic case @xmath68 , @xcite .",
    "+ the length of the resolution ( [ mr ] ) is the projective dimension of the left module @xmath8 .",
    "it is classical @xcite , @xcite that the left global dimension of @xmath33 ( for @xmath43 ) coincides with the projective dimension of @xmath8 as left module and that it also coincides with the right global dimension ( and with the projective dimension of @xmath8 as right module ) .",
    "furthermore it has been shown recently @xcite that this dimension also coincides with the hochschild dimension of @xmath33 in homology as well as in cohomology .",
    "so for an algebra @xmath43 there is a unique definition of the dimension from a homological point of view which will be refered to as _",
    "its global dimension _ in the sequel . in the following",
    ", we shall only consider algebras in @xmath19 with finite global dimensions .",
    "+ it is worth noticing here that there is another dimension for @xmath43 which is the gelfand - kirillov dimension but since in the following polynomial growth plays no role ( and therefore will not be assumed ) we shall only consider the global dimension for our general analysis .",
    "we now assume that @xmath69 is of finite global dimension @xmath70 .",
    "the ( free ) resolution ( [ mr ] ) of @xmath8 reads then @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "+ by applying the functor @xmath73 to the chain complex @xmath74 of ( free ) left @xmath33-modules , one obtains a cochain complex @xmath75 @xmath76 of right @xmath33-modules .",
    "the cohomology @xmath77 of this complex is by definition @xmath78 that is one has @xmath79 for any @xmath80 .",
    "+ by definition @xmath33 is said to be gorenstein if one has @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this means that @xmath84 is a free resolution of @xmath8 as right @xmath33-module .",
    "this resolution is then a minimal projective resolution of the right @xmath33-module @xmath8 which implies the isomorphisms @xmath85 of vector spaces and therefore @xmath86 for @xmath87 . +",
    "thus the gorenstein property is a variant of the poincar duality property .",
    "let @xmath54 be a graded algebra of @xmath19 , @xmath33 will be said to be _ regular _ if it is of finite global dimension , @xmath88 , and is gorenstein .",
    "this definition of regularity is directly inspired from the one of @xcite which will be refered to as as - regularity , the only difference is that we have dropped the condition of polynomial growth since we do not need it for the analysis in the sequel and since it would eliminate very interesting examples .",
    "+ this is the class of algebras that we would like to analyse and we shall do it for low global dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for higher global dimension",
