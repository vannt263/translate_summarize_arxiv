    ", a lot of work has been done in the recent years .",
    "many quantum corrections for relevant observables which contain information on the higgs boson are available @xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections of enhanced electroweak strength to the decay of the higgs boson were first derived at one - loop in @xcite , and at two - loop in @xcite . for low values of the higgs mass the theoretical uncertainty is thus small . for heavier masses the leading order and next - to - leading order results , start to deviate from the nnlo result , inducing theoretical ambiguities .",
    "one expects large dependences on the renormalization scheme essentially coming from the truncation of the perturbative series which makes theoretical predictions unreliable .",
    "whereas the perturbative region will be fully covered by lep , tevatron and the lhc , it is of special importance to have a good theoretical understanding of the heavy higgs regime which is also in reach of the lhc .",
    "although the existing experimental data points presently in the direction of a higgs mass in the perturbative region , one should not forget that these bounds are logarithmically soft , and that the experimental data on @xmath8 still differ considerably in the high precision measurements at lep1 and slc @xcite .",
    "moreover , certain two - loop quantities are presently known theoretically only as mass expansions , and given the high statistics of the experiments , this induces rather substantial shifts in the higgs mass prediction .",
    "apart from the phenomenological motivation , it is a major challenge to develop and improve calculational methods beyond the standard perturbative approach .",
    "a well - known nonperturbative approach are monte carlo studies on a lattice .",
    "the results of lattice calculations indicate that for higgs masses beyond @xmath9 700 gev one expects large cutoff effects @xcite .",
    "they stem from the fact that the higgs sector is not asymptotically free .",
    "we advocate another nonperturbative approach , the @xmath0 expansion . there ,",
    "the quantum correction are ordered by the number of field components @xcite .",
    "the method was applied to the higgs sector to leading order a long time ago @xcite but the large deviation from standard perturbative results shaded doubts on its validity .",
    "recently we performed a next - to - leading order calculation of the higgs propagator , showing at low coupling a remarkable agreement between the nnlo perturbative result and our result @xcite .",
    "this proved the @xmath0 expansion to be a valuable tool for computing observables beyond the perturbative approach , and for avoiding the truncation of the perturbative series and thus eliminating any renormalization scale dependence .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results to the case of three - point functions , which results in a quantitative , nonperturbative understanding of the physical processes @xmath10 .",
    "it was tried to make the computation as transparent as possible to convince the reader that the method is conceptually well settled and practicable , though some amount of numerical work is unavoidable , which on the other hand is common to the calculation of higher - order finite momentum green functions in massive theories .",
    "after some preliminaries , where we remind the lo results and the issue of the tachyon of the @xmath0 approach , we show how one obtains a well defined , tachyon free representation of green functions .",
    "an ultraviolet subtraction scheme is defined in terms of an order @xmath0 counterterm lagrangean .",
    "then , the finite and tachyon free green functions are expressed in form of multiloop graphs made out of dressed propagators .",
    "these can be reduced to two - dimensional integrals over dressed propagators and form factors .",
    "then we describe how to perform the remaining integrations numerically , to obtain the final results for the two- and three - point functions .",
    "we show and discuss our nonperturbative result for the higgs line shapes in two physical scattering processes , and compare to the perturbative result . after this discussion , we summarize the conclusions of the paper .",
    "in this section we review the leading order result for fixing our notations , and discuss the structure of the counterterms which absorb the ultraviolet divergencies at leading and next - to - leading order .    because we are interested in the effects of a heavy higgs boson",
    ", we neglect all the gauge couplings and also the higher order corrections in the yukawa couplings .",
    "thus , the starting point for the @xmath0 expansion in a scalar theory is given by an @xmath11-symmetric @xmath12 theory :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is a @xmath15-component vector and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are bare coupling constants indicated by the subscript zero .",
    "because we want to focus on the spontaneously broken case , we rewrite it as    @xmath18    @xmath19 is the bare vacuum expectation value of @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry of the ground state is broken down to @xmath21 , which amounts to the presence of @xmath22 massless goldstone bosons ( gbs ) , @xmath23 , and a higgs particle @xmath24 , of mass @xmath25 . in the case",

    "one additionally has the freedom to replace @xmath31 by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are some constants , without changing the equations of motion .",
    "these constants correspond to a @xmath34 vacuum expectation value and a wave function renormalization .",
    "we introduce renormalized quantities in the following way :    @xmath35    from the discussion above it is clear that only @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are renormalization constants in the usual sense .",
    "the other can be chosen arbitrarily as long as the choice is consistent .",
    "their introduction will turn out to be useful for the renormalization of functions which contain auxiliary particles as external legs .",
    "the lagrangean is now of the form :    @xmath40    note that a mixing between @xmath34 and @xmath41 takes place .",
    "we see that the expression contains  up to a trivial surface term @xmath42  all possible field combinations of dimension four which are built out of an @xmath11 vector and a dimension two singlet field allowed by lorentz invariance and the @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the higgs reduces the symmetry as usual to @xmath21 .",
    "the constants @xmath43 are expressible in terms of the above renormalization constants .",
    "@xmath44    these constants define a redundant counterterm structure of the theory , and are fixed by imposing conditions on one - particle irreducible green functions . whereas some are necessary to absorb the divergencies occurring in physical processes , other can be adjusted to make subtractions on green functions containing auxiliary fields as external legs .",
    "clearly all these subtractions have to be consistent with each other . in order to determine the renormalization constants , the quantum corrections to the tree level green functions have to be calculated up to a given order , and have to be related to the counterterms by a renormalization scheme .    in perturbation theory",
    "the occurring renormalization scheme dependence is proportional to some power of the coupling constant , and namely one order higher than the loop order in which the process is calculated .",
    "thus it is enhanced in the case of strong coupling .",
    "it is a crucial point that this is not the case in the @xmath0 expansion . once the relations between a set of observables and the green functions are fixed , all further predictions are exact , up to unevaluated powers of @xmath0 .",
    "a change of the ultraviolet subtraction point @xmath45 ( see below ) is compensated by a change in @xmath46 .",
    "thus it does not effect any observable prediction , being merely a reparameterization of the theory .    before describing the computation of the higgs propagator in next - to - leading order in @xmath0",
    ", we would like to repeat the leading order results to set the stage for the next step . to order @xmath47 the quantum corrections are simply the sum of all graphs containing arbitrary numbers of external @xmath34 legs attached to a gb loop .",
    "the sum can be carried out and a simple closed expression for the resulting effective potential can be found @xcite .",

    "no other renormalization constant is involved . whereas the observable vev is defined by the ground state of the theory",
    " resulting in an observable vector boson mass if one couples the model to a gauge theory  the value of @xmath46 can be fixed by a measurement of the higgs mass . in terms of the introduced renormalization constants ,",

    "the occurrence of the tachyon in the sigma model is widely believed to be an indication of an ill - defined quantum field theory .",
    "however , to or knowledge there is so far no rigorous proof thereof .",
    "we will show in the next section that the tachyon is technically an artifact of perturbation theory and can by no means be considered an inconsistency of the model .",
    "apart from these issues , it is natural to ask for higher order effects . how to go beyond the leading order in @xmath0 is directly related to the tachyon problem , because on has to integrate over graphs built out of tachyon contaminated propagators .",
    "a method to treat this is given below .",
    "such a procedure is touching the aspects of the theory which can not be investigated by feynman diagrams , even summed up to all orders . in this sense",
    "any tachyonic regularization is modeling either effects from a more fundamental theory containing the higgs sector as a low energy limit , or a certain type of nonperturbative effects within the higgs sector itself .",
    "our nonperturbative treatment of the sigma model is independent of an interpretation either as an effective theory or as a fundamental theory , and we will make no assumption in this direction in this paper .",
    "in this section we explain the necessary steps to calculate the nlo corrections to the processes @xmath65 in the @xmath0 expansion . in the case of longitudinal vector boson decay modes ,",
    "we calculate the processes by using the equivalence theorem .",

    "<S> we show in this paper that the @xmath0 expansion is a reliable tool to calculate the properties of a heavy higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the 1/n expansion sums up all orders in perturbation theory , and therefore avoids the renormalization scheme dependence of the conventional perturbative approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is explained how effects due to the landau pole of the higgs sector are isolated and subtracted , and how to perform actual calculations , by computing the higgs line shape for the processes @xmath1 at next - to - leading order in the @xmath0 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to the perturbative results to show the agreement between the perturbative and the nonperturbative approach for higgs masses up to 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the theoretical predictions for higgs observables are well under control for the entire kinematical region of the lhc .    = 14pt = 6.0 in = 8.5 in -0.25truein 0.30truein 0.30truein    lapth 692 - 98 + um - th 98 - 12 + cern - th/98 - 244 + august 1998    * *    * new developments in the @xmath0 expansion and nonperturbative higgs physics * +   thomas binoth@xmath2 and adrian ghinculov@xmath3 + _ </S>",
