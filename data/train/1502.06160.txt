    "the first documented use of pairwise comparisons ( pc ) is attributed to ramon llull , a 13th - century mystic and philosopher .",

    "this work provides a more refined alo - group perspective on inconsistency in pairwise comparisons originated in @xcite where deficiencies exist and some ( but not all ) are addressed in this study .",
    "all measurement ( physical or not ) are related to pairwise comparisons .",
    "for example , when we say that the distance between stars @xmath0 and @xmath1 is 2.71 light years , we simply compare the unit of distance ( in this case , one light year ) to the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "pairwise comparisons are of particular use where a unit of measurement can not be defined and it is so for most subjective assessments .",
    "for example , public safety or environmental pollution lacks a unit ( or a `` yard stick '' ) for the measurement , however , it is still necessary to measure it by comparing them to each other and expressing it by a ratio stored in what we call a pc matrix .",
    "a triad @xmath2 of entries of pc matrix , expressing ratios of three entities , is called consistent if @xmath3 .",
    "this is a case of _ multiplicative consistency _ expressing ratios of compared entities .",
    "another approach to the consistency of triads of numbers is additive .",
    "namely , a triad @xmath4 of numbers is called _ additively consistent _ if @xmath5 .",

    ", the multiplicative consistency has been mostly considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additive pc have been analyzed in @xcite recently .",
    "differences between quality values instead of ratios appear in btl model . in @xcite , both multiplicative and additive",
    "pairwise comparisons were unified to the comparisons of elements of abelian linearly ordered groups ( in abbreviation ; alo - groups ) .",
    "a consistency index of triads of elements of an alo - group was defined in @xcite ( for a single triad , defined in @xcite of 1993 ) .",
    "an inconsistency indicator for triads , introduced in @xcite for the multiplicative case in 1993 for a single triad was extended in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of koczkodaj s inconsistency indicator is included in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an axiomatization of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons was proposed in @xcite ( with some minor deficiencies being currently corrected ) .",
