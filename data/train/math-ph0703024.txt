    "in this appendix , we present the mathematical framework in which the identification problem can be considered . moreover , we review briefly the former work on the identifiability of the considered system .",
    "a well - posedness result which allows us to consider the identification problem in section  [ sec : gen ] will be announced .",
    "the goal is to identify @xmath270 or / and @xmath271 in system @xmath272 when laboratory measurements on some physical observables are provided . in  @xcite ,",
    "two different settings have been considered in order to characterize the identifiability of such a system :    ( s1 ) : :    the hamiltonian @xmath4 is known and the goal is to identify    the dipole moment @xmath271 . the so - called _ populations _ along    the eigenstates @xmath273 , i.e.    @xmath274 are    measured for all instants @xmath275 .",

    "the    eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath270 are also assumed    to be known ( this assumption is relevant in practice , see    remark  [ rem : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "here we measure the populations    @xmath276 along the states of a canonical basis    @xmath277    for all instants @xmath278 and all control amplitudes    @xmath9 .",
    "[ rem : spectroscopy ] it is relevant in practice to assume that the eigenvalues of the internal hamiltonian @xmath270 are known .",
    "in fact the classical spectroscopy allows for identifying the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and discriminating between two systems that do not share the same ones .",
    "in fact spectroscopy only gives eigenvalue differences ( transition frequencies ) , not the absolute values .",
    "the overall unknown additive factor is not seen by the measurements and has no impact on the identification result .    in this paper , we have only considered the first setting .",
    "an extension of the technique to the second setting remains to be done in future work .",
