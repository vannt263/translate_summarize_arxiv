    "according to the modern cosmology , the dark matter , corresponding to @xmath2 of the total cosmological density , is nonbaryonic and consists of new stable forms of matter ( see e.g.@xcite for review and references ) that saturate the measured dark matter density and decouple from plasma and radiation at least before the beginning of the matter dominated ( md ) stage .",
    "a huge landscape of possible candidates for the dark matter is proposed as well as their mixtures in multi - component dark matter scenarios are also possible @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are a very sensitive cosmological probe for physical phenomena occurring in the early universe .",
    "they could be formed by many different mechanisms ( see e.g.  @xcite for review and references ) .",
    "being formed , pbhs should retain in the universe and , if survive up to the present time , represent a specific form of the dark matter .",
    "effect of pbh evaporation by s.w.hawking @xcite makes evaporating pbhs a source of fluxes of products of evaporation , particularly of @xmath3 radiation @xcite . in a wide range of parameters the predicted effect of pbhs",
    "contradicts the data and it puts restrictions on mechanism of pbh formation and the underlying physics of very early universe . on the other hand , at some fixed values of parameters , pbhs or effects of their evaporation can provide a nontrivial solution for astrophysical problems .    here",
    "we outline some signatures of pbhs as a dominant or subdominant component of the dark matter .",
    "we briefly discuss the way for the pbh spectrum to reflect properties of superheavy metastable particles and parameters of phase transitions in the inflationary and post - inflationary stages ( section  [ hep ] ) . these mechanisms of pbh formation have a specific feature of fixed range or even fixed values of pbh mass , what leads to effects of the pbh dark matter considered in section  [ effects ] .",
    "the impact of constraints and cosmological scenarios , involving pbhs , on high energy physics is briefly discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "a black hole ( bh ) formation is highly improbable in homogeneous expanding universe , since it implies metric fluctuations of order 1 . in the universe with the equation of state @xmath4 with numerical factor @xmath3 being in the range @xmath5 , a probability to form bh from fluctuation within cosmological horizon is given by ( see e.g. @xcite for review and references ) @xmath6 it provides exponential sensitivity of the pbh spectrum to softening of the equation of state in the early universe ( @xmath7 ) or to increasing of the ultraviolet part of the density fluctuations spectrum ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these phenomena can appear as cosmological consequence of the particle theory .",
    "it was first noticed in @xcite that dominance of superheavy metastable particles with lifetime @xmath9 in the universe before their decay at @xmath10 can result in formation of pbhs , retaining in the universe after the particles decay and keeping some information on particle properties in their spectrum .",
    "the mechanism @xcite is effective for formation of the pbhs with mass in the interval [ mint ] m_0 m m_. the minimal mass corresponds to the mass within cosmological horizon in the period @xmath11 when particles with mass @xmath12 and relative abundance @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is frozen out concentration of particles and @xmath15 is concentration of the relativistic species ) start to dominate in the universe .",
    "this mass is equal to @xcite @xmath16 the maximal mass is indirectly determined by the condition that fluctuation in the considered scale @xmath17 , entering the horizon at @xmath18 with an amplitude @xmath19 can manage to grow up to nonlinear stage , decouple and collapse before particles decay at @xmath20 . for",
    "the scale invariant spectrum @xmath21 the maximal mass is given by @xcite @xmath22      scale non - invariant spectrum of fluctuations , in which amplitude of small scale fluctuations is enhanced , can be another factor increasing the probability of pbh formation .",
    "the realistic treatment of the existence of other scalar fields along with inflaton in the period of inflation can give rise to the spectra with distinguished scales , determined by parameters of the considered fields and their interaction .",
    "in chaotic inflation scenario interaction of a higgs field with inflaton can give rise to phase transitions in the inflationary stage .",
    "such phase transitions in the inflationary stage lead to the appearance of specific spikes in the spectrum of the initial density perturbations .",
    "these spike - like perturbations , on scales that cross the horizon ( 601 ) @xmath23 folds before the end of the inflation reenter the horizon during the radiation or the dust - like era and could in principle collapse to form pbhs . the possibility of such spikes in chaotic inflation scenario was first pointed out in @xcite and implemented in @xcite as a mechanism of pbh formation .    if phase transition takes place at @xmath23folding @xmath24 before the end of inflation , the spike re - enters horizon in the radiation dominance ( rd ) stage and forms bh of mass [ mrd ] m ( 2 n ) , where @xmath25 is the hubble constant in the period of inflation .",
    "if the spike re - enters horizon in the md stage it should form bhs of mass [ mmd ] m ( 3 n ) .      first order phase transition goes through bubble nucleation , in which the false vacuum state decays leading to a nucleation of bubbles of the true vacuum and their subsequent expansion @xcite .",
    "the potential energy of the false vacuum is converted into kinetic energy of the bubble walls thus making them highly relativistic in a short time .",
    "the bubble expands untill it collides with another one .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , a bh may be created in a collision of two bubbles .",
    "the mass of this pbh is given by ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the mass that could be contained in the bubble volume at the epoch of collision in the condition of a full thermalization of bubbles .",
    "if inflation ends by the first order phase transition , collision between bubbles of hubble size in percolation regime leads to copious pbh formation with masses    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the mass of hubble horizon at the end of inflation . according to @xcite the initial mass fraction of this pbhs is given by @xmath31 .",
    "for example , for typical value of @xmath32 the initial mass fraction @xmath33 is contained in pbhs with mass @xmath34  g.      extra space as a source of the dark matter attracts attention for a long time . in this case",
    "wimps of various sorts are usually connected to the first kk excitation states , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "new idea concerning the essence of the dark matter and its origin was proposed in @xcite in the framework of multidimensional gravity with higher derivatives . according to the authors idea",
    "the geometry of compact extra dimensions depends on the initial conditions .",
    "it was shown there that space domains of the dark matter could appear if geometry of a 2-dim extra space inside the domains and outside them is different .",
    "such regions contain some excess of the energy density , interact only gravitationally and hence may be considered as a dark matter candidate .",
    "these domains move in the galaxy with the virial velocity about @xmath35 km / s and represent the cold dark matter .",
    "it is interesting problem to find a method of their detection because ordinary particle detectors are not aimed for such events .",
    "indeed , as was shown in @xcite one can neglect the excitations of the domain during its non - relativistic interaction with nucleus of a detector provided the multidimensional planck mass is about @xmath36 gev . in this case",
    "pure elastic scattering of nuclei on the domain as a whole takes place .",
    "the question is whether one can distinguish such a `` moessbauer '' scattering and the ordinary one .",
    "minimal size of such objects is comparable to a size of the extra space with the mass varying in wide range depending on the initial conditions and numerical values of the model parameters . more or less natural mass of wimps in this model is about 10 tev . in this case",
    "new methods of the dark matter detection has to be developed .",
    "the primary estimation of such objects interaction with nucleons leads to the cross section about @xmath37  @xmath38 what does not contradict constraints on very massive dark matter particles .",
    "a wide class of particle models possesses a symmetry breaking pattern , which can be effectively described by pseudo - nambu - goldstone field and which corresponds to formation of unstable topological defect structure in the early universe ( see @xcite for review and references ) .",
    "the nambu - goldstone nature in such an effective description reflects the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry , resulting in continuous degeneracy of vacua . the explicit symmetry breaking at smaller energy scale changes this continuous degeneracy by discrete vacuum degeneracy .",
    "it gives rise to specific mechanisms of pbh formation .",
    "if phase transitions take place in the inflational stage , new forms of primordial large scale correlations appear .",
    "the value of phase after the first phase transition at the energy scale @xmath39 is inflated over the region corresponding to the period of inflation , while fluctuations of this phase change in the course of inflation its initial value within the regions of smaller size .",
    "owing to such fluctuations , for the fixed value of @xmath40 in the period of inflation with _",
    "e - folding _",
    "@xmath41 corresponding to the part of the universe within the modern cosmological horizon , strong deviations from this value appear at smaller scales , corresponding to later periods of inflation with @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath43 , the fluctuations can move the value of @xmath44 to @xmath45 in some regions of the universe . after reheating in the result of the second phase transition at the scale @xmath46 these regions correspond to vacuum with @xmath47 , being surrounded by the bulk of the volume with vacuum @xmath48 . as a result",
    "massive walls are formed at the border between the two vacua . since regions with @xmath47",
    "are confined , the domain walls are closed .",
    "after their size equals the horizon , closed walls can collapse into bhs .",
    "this mechanism can lead to formation of pbhs of a whatever large mass ( up to the mass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , see for latest review @xcite ) .",
    "such bhs appear in the form of the pbh clusters , exhibiting fractal distribution in space .",
    "it can shed new light on the problem of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the mass range of formed bhs is constrained by fundamental parameters @xmath39 and @xmath49 of the model .",
    "the maximal bh mass is determined by the condition that the wall does not dominate locally before it enters the cosmological horizon .",
    "otherwise , local wall dominance leads to a superluminal @xmath50 expansion for the corresponding region , separating it from the other part of the universe .",
    "this condition corresponds to the mass @xcite [ mmax ] m_max = m_pl()^2 .",
    "the minimal mass follows from the condition that the gravitational radius of bh exceeds the width of the wall and it is equal to @xcite [ mmin ] m_min = f()^2 .",
    "the mechanism of pbh formation from the closed walls can be implemented for creation of pbh with mass @xmath52 g. pbhs with similar mass avoid constraints from observations by gamma - radiation data and femto / micro lensing effects @xcite , so they can provide the dominant part of the dark matter .",
    "attempt to constrain pbh with mass @xmath53 g , based on a tidal capture of pbh by neutron star @xcite , met some counter - evidence @xcite .     as a function of ( 60-n ) , where @xmath24 is the number of the e - fold , @xmath54;,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    here we follow to the specific mechanism developed in @xcite .",

    "the presence of quantum corrections is responsible for the next term appearing in the potential : @xmath71 so that @xmath49 is supposed to be small . during inflation , when the friction term is large the classical motion of the angular field @xmath72 is frozen due to the smallness of the potential tilt .",
    "the dynamics of the radial field @xmath70 is governed by the equation of motion : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is hubble s parameter .",
    "this differential equation can be solved numerically .    while field @xmath70 is moving classically to the potential minimum @xmath75 , the phase @xmath76 changes due to the quantum fluctuations at the de sitter background . during inflation",
    "the amplitude of the phase @xmath72 changes as @xmath77 each e - fold , where @xmath78 is the average absolute value of the field @xmath70 during the e - fold .",
    "discrete spectrum @xmath79 of specific masses @xmath80 of pbh can be easily obtained by iterative procedure @xcite .",

    "as was noted , pbh with mass around @xmath89 g can provide the dominant form of the dark matter .",
    "the pbhs of these range of mass have even more attractive features : with the help of them one could explain positron line from the galactic center @xcite due to effects of accretion @xcite or the hawking evaporation @xcite .",
    "here we discuss possibility to explain with them a reionization of the universe on the base of the hawking evaporation effect .    in our estimations",
