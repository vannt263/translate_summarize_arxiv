    "from recent hst observations of the @xmath7 absorption - line system toward the quasar q  1718 + 4807 webb _",
    "[ 8,9 ] deduced d / h = @xmath8 .",
    "this ratio is significantly higher than that derived from other quasar spectra .",
    "for instance , at @xmath9 toward q  1009 + 2956 the d / h ratio lies in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 [ 1 ] .",
    "new measurements [ 2 ] give a slightly higher range for the d / h value at @xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) which is still incompatible with the results of webb _ et al . _",
    "according to the basic idea of homogeneity and isotropy of the big bang universe the _ primordial _ deuterium abundance should not vary in space .",
    "one can only expect that the d abundance decreases with cosmic time due to conversion of d into @xmath13he and heavier elements in stars . to check whether big bang nucleosynthesis [ bbn ] has occurred homogeneously or",
    "not , precise measurements of absolute values of d / h at high redshift are extremely important . in a series of papers [ 3 - 6 ]",
    "we have shown that this task is badly model dependent . here",
    "we present two examples to underline the difficulties of the inverse problem in the analysis of the h+d absorption blends .",
    "we consider a cloud of a thickness @xmath14 with a stochastic velocity field but of homogeneous ( h  i ) density and temperature .",
    "the velocity field is characterized by its rms amplitude @xmath15 and its correlation length @xmath16 .",
    "the model is identical to that of [ 5 ] .",
    "this approach generalizes the standard procedure which assumes no spatial correlations in the velocity field ( @xmath17 ) . ",
    "to estimate physical parameters and an appropriate velocity field structure along the line of sight , we used a reverse monte carlo [ rmc ] technique .",
    "the algorithm requires to define a simulation box for 5 physical parameters  : n(h  i ) , d / h , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 denotes the thermal width of the hydrogen lines ) . ",
    "the continuous random function of the coordinate @xmath22 is represented by its sampled values at equal space intervals @xmath23 , i.e. by @xmath24 , the vector of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight at the spatial points @xmath25 ( for more detail , see [ 5 ] ) .",
    "direct observations of galactic halos at @xmath26 [ 7 ] show that @xmath27 km s@xmath28 , if @xmath29 k. our rmc calculations yield for the @xmath9 and @xmath30 absorption systems @xmath31 km s@xmath28 [ 5,6 ] which makes the procedure to be adequate , whereas @xmath32 km s@xmath28 found in [ 1,2 ] and @xmath33 km s@xmath28 found in [ 8,9 ] are evidently too low .",
    "to illustrate our results , we show in fig .",
    "1 h+d ly@xmath34 lines observed by the two groups [ 1,2 ] and [ 8,9 ] and some of the adequate profile fits ( @xmath35 per degree of freedom @xmath36 ) .",
    "the solutions are not unique , however , but depend sensitively on the velocity field configuration along the line of sight ( see [ 5,6 ] , for more examples ) . fig .",
    "1 shows that both profiles are compatible with d / h @xmath37 ( the uncertainty range is from @xmath38 to @xmath39 [ 5,6 ] ) .",
    "taking the mean d / h value from this range , one can estimate the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath40 during sbbn and using the present - day photon density determined from the cosmic microwave background measurements , one can obtain the current baryon density @xmath41  : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , correspondingly .",
    "we conclude that the reliability of the interpretation of deuterium absorption line observations at high redshift is determined by two factors  : ( @xmath42 ) improvements in the detection equipment , and ( @xmath43 ) advances in the theory of line formation in turbulent media .",
