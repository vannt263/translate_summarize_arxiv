    "in his seminal work @xcite lorenz introduced the following system of equations @xmath1 as a simplified model for atmospheric convection . numerical analysis",
    "performed by lorenz showed that the above system exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions and has a non - periodic  strange \" attractor . a rigorous mathematical framework of similar flows was initiated with the introduction of the so called geometric lorenz flow in @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is well known that the geometric lorenz attractor , whose vector field will be denoted by @xmath2 , is robust in the @xmath3 topology @xcite .",
    "this means that vector fields @xmath4 that are sufficiently close in the @xmath3 topology to @xmath2 admit invariant contracting foliations @xmath5 on the poincar section @xmath6 and they admit strange attractors .",
    "more precisely , there exists an open neighbourhood @xmath7 in @xmath8 containing @xmath9 , the attractor of @xmath2 , and an open neighbourhood @xmath10 of @xmath2 in the @xmath3 topology such that for all vector fields @xmath11 , the maximal invariant set @xmath12 is a transitive set which is invariant under the flow of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite provided a computer - assisted proof that the classical lorenz flow ; i.e. , the flow defined in has a robustly transitive invariant set containing an equilibrium point . in @xcite it is proven that lorenz flow is mixing",
    ". recently , arajo and melboune proved in @xcite that the stable foliation of the lorenz flow is @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , they showed that this property is robust ; i.e. , @xmath3 perturbations @xmath13 of the lorenz flow admit a @xmath0 stable foliation , and such foliations are close to the stable foliation of the original lorenz flow in the @xmath3-topology .",
    "further , in another paper arajo and melbourne @xcite showed that the lorenz system is exponentially mixing and that this property is robust in the @xmath3-topology .",
    "in this paper we study a family of perturbations @xmath4 which are consistent with the results of @xcite and prove statistical stability and variance continuity of lorenz attractors with a @xmath0 stable foliation .",
    "for a precise statement see theorem [ main ] and theorem [ main3 ] in section [ setup ] .",
    "previous results on the statistical stability of lorenz attractors was announced in @xcite but only for flows with @xmath14 stable foliations . in @xcite among other things , statistical stability of poincar maps for ` @xmath15-like ' lorenz attractors is studied . both @xcite and",

    ", we only assume @xmath0 stable foliation for the family of flows and we prove that the corresponding @xmath16-d maps are strongly statistically stable .",
    "we then obtain statistical stability for the family of flows and we obtain robustness of the variance in the clt of the corresponding 1-d maps .",
    "subsequently , with a martingale coboundary decomposition assumption on observables of the flows , we show that the variance in the clt for the family of flows is also robust .",
    "our proofs allow the discontinuities in the base of the corresponding poincar maps to change with the perturbation ( see figure [ 1dfig ] for an illustration ) .",
