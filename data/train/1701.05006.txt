    "one of the most basic and broadly applicable principles in all of physics is _",
    "adiabatic decoupling_. it is already familiar from school physics : two weakly coupled degrees of freedom will only exchange substantial amounts of energy if their resonant frequencies match . in more sophisticated language ,",
    "adiabatic decoupling means that the effects of fast degrees of freedom on slow degrees of freedom can be described by renormalizing the effective hamiltonian which governs the slow time evolution .",
    "applications of this principle range from the born - oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics @xcite to effective langrangians and renormalization in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "whether the fast degrees of freedom in question are gluons in nuclear matter , atomic excitations , or vibrations in a rigid body , it is thanks to adiabatic decoupling that we can ` adiabatically eliminate ' or ` integrate out ' high - frequency modes , to leave an effective hamiltonian which describes only slow variables , and yet describes them accurately , even over long times .",
    "while the power of adiabatic elimination is often celebrated , its most basic implication is less frequently noted : since the slow evolution is hamiltonian , it conserves energy .",
    "fast degrees of freedom can not steadily inject energy into the low - frequency world . or can they ?      consider the case of combustion engines .",
    "these are such large and complex dynamical systems that they must in practice be described thermodynamically , rather than in microscopic terms . in principle , however , a real engine could still operate within a sealed container , at least for some time , as long as the container were large enough to include air , exhaust , and so on .",
    "the operation of a combustion engine is thus in principle a case of closed - system hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "what a combustion engine nonetheless does , however , is to extract energy steadily from chemical degrees of freedom , whose dynamical time scales are on the order of femtoseconds ( frequencies @xmath0 hz ) , and then ultimately use this energy to turn wheels at a few thousand revolutions per minute ( @xmath1 hz ) . if we introduce the term _ steady downconversion _ to mean this kind of steady transfer of energy across a dynamical frequency gap , precisely as is normally forbidden by adiabatic decoupling , then steady downconversion across a frequency ratio of @xmath2 is in fact achievable , albeit in dynamical systems too large and complex for microscopic description .      the question of exactly how it is that macroscopic engines manage to evade adiabatic decoupling , and achieve steady downconversion , leads quickly into the general question of how thermodynamics ` emerges ' from mechanics in the limit of large system size .",
    "much has been learned about that emergence , however , by starting from the microscopic side of the limit .",
    "the main goal of such work has hitherto been to learn how the ensembles of statistical mechanics can be justified by effective ergodization within hamiltonian mechanics . as a fine example of this kind of study",
    ", we are inspired by the classic work of chirikov , in showing how a not - too - small perturbation of an integrable system can break the invariant tori of kolmogorov - arnold - moser theory @xcite and lead to effectively ergodic behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , chirikov presented instructive models of nonlinear oscillation , and showed how certain resonant perturbations can induce arnold diffusion @xcite , even in systems with few degrees of freedom . in the present paper",
    "we take a similar approach , to the point of studying some quite similar hamiltonians .",
    "the significant differences that we will introduce , however , will reflect a quite orthogonal perspective : our concern is not information , but energy . instead of aiming to understand the effective loss of information that is represented in statistical mechanics by ensembles , we will focus on steady downconversion as a mechanical analog to the conversion of energy - dense fuel into work , as in a combustion engine .",
    "our basic question is therefore : in a phase space of only a few dimensions , what kind of hamiltonian system can exhibit steady downconversion ?",
    "because our central concern is thus secular energy transfer between slow and fast degrees of freedom , it is an important restriction that we will further insist on a _ time - independent _ hamiltonian , so that the system conserves its total energy and no important energetic behavior is ` put in by hand ' .",
    "this restriction to time - independent hamiltonians means that although we are only seeking a sort of minimal toy model for a combustion engine , yet in an important way our quest is more ambitious than most theoretical models for microscopic engines : we do not allow the kind of macroscopic elements that are represented by external control parameters ( which would make the hamiltonian time - dependent ) or by heat reservoirs ( which would make the evolution non - hamiltonian ) .",
    "the kind of system we seek can thus be thought of as a sort of mechanical maxwell s demon  except that instead of being directed against the second law of thermodynamics , the principle it contrives to violate is that of adiabatic decoupling .",
    "it is also an important difference that our small hamiltonian systems constitute our entire systems of study , and are not , like maxwell s demon , small additions to macroscopically large systems .",
    "insofar as we are considering microscopic analogs of engines , we are considering _",
    "entirely _ microscopic analogs , not just microscopic working parts which extract energy from macroscopic heat baths . in our discussion at the end of this paper we will briefly compare this kind of isolated small system with systems coupled to baths .    to suggest the kinship of our systems with the demon , while also acknowledging the important differences",
    ", we will refer more briefly to `` small dynamical systems with time - independent hamiltonians which exhibit steady energy transfer from fast to slow motion '' as _",
    "hamiltonian daemons_. the first question of our paper is then : do daemons exist , mathematically ?",
    "the answer can be seen from fig .  1",
    ".    [ fig1 ]      what fig .",
    "1 shows is the position @xmath3 ( upper plot ) and velocity @xmath4 ( lower plot ) of a certain point mass , which moves in time ( horizontal axes ) under the canonical equations of motion generated by the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) , which we will present in section ii and then analyze for the bulk of this paper .",
    "two other oscillators are also coupled in ( [ h1 ] ) to the @xmath3 point mass , but are not represented in the figure .    in fig .",
    "1 what we see is that @xmath3 oscillates harmonically for a couple of periods , indicating that the point mass is moving in a quadratic potential .",
    "this point mass is also subject to other forces , however , and is not simply a harmonic oscillator , because after a few oscillations , it suddenly begins a ` driving phase ' of motion at nearly steady velocity , as if an engine had been turned on .",
    "after some time of this nearly steady motion , @xmath3 abruptly resumes harmonic motion , and at a much larger amplitude than it had initially ; something has done a lot of work on the mass during the driving phase of motion .",
    "in fact this work has come from the system s other two oscillators , which evolve on high frequencies .",
    "small effects of these coupled high - frequencies are shown , in the insets of fig .",
    "1b ) , in the otherwise steadier speed of @xmath3 . the remarkable feature of fig .  1",
    ", however , is a much more dramatic effect of the coupling of @xmath3 to the high - frequency oscillators . during the driving phase of motion , when @xmath4 stays nearly constant , the high - frequency part of the system steadily transfers energy to @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 is thus a proof by example that daemons are allowed by the laws of mechanics @xcite .",
    "we will further show that daemons are a general class of dynamical systems featuring three distinct time scales , and that they obey certain non - trivial constraints , which are in some respects reminiscent of the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "we will approach these general points by first explaining the particular system of fig .  1 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system of fig .  1 is @xmath5 with the particular values @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath13 does not depend explicitly on time , it is conserved . the work done on the mass depicted in fig .",
    "1 is drawn from the initial energy of the @xmath14 oscillator , though the high frequency which actually matters dynamically in this system is really the difference @xmath15 .",
    "the quantitative parameters of this model were chosen for illustrative purposes ; the system s behavior is not qualitatively sensitive to their precise values @xcite .    secular energy transfer in @xmath13 is non - trivial : if we let @xmath16 we would simply have three harmonic oscillators , and even with the nonzero value of @xmath17 that we actually have , their three frequencies all differ by much more than the frequency scale @xmath18 associated with the coupling between them . from this one would normally deduce _ adiabatic decoupling _ : to zeroth order in @xmath17 the three co - ordinates should simply oscillate , and do so at greatly different frequencies , so that the coupling term would be not only small , but rapidly oscillating , and hence it should average to zero and have no significant effect of any kind . beyond zeroth order , energy exchange would indeed occur , but it would be small in amplitude and high in frequency , with no net long - term ( secular ) effect .",
    "this kind of adiabatically decoupled behavior is indeed seen in fig .  1 before and after the driving phase , but the driving phase defies the expectation of adiabatic decoupling .    the expectation of adiabatic decoupling in this case is based on the assumption that a weak coupling , such as we have , can only have substantial effects if it is also resonant . in linear dynamics , resonance means frequency matching , and since our three oscillators frequencies are badly mismatched , linear dynamics would imply adiabatic decoupling .",
    "weak but highly nonlinear couplings , however , may be resonant after all , at least in some regions of phase space , even across large frequency gaps .",
    "this is the kind of exception to adiabatic decoupling that our daemon exploits",
    ".      numerical solution of the equations of motion for @xmath13 in fact confirms that adiabatic decoupling is the case throughout most of phase space .",
    "the coupling term in @xmath13 is a highly nonlinear function of @xmath3 , however , and this provides a nonlinear loophole in adiabatic decoupling .",
    "a special case occurs when @xmath19 happens to be rising or falling at close to the critical speed @xmath20 . in this circumstance ,",
    "@xmath21 is not just rapidly oscillatory , so as to average to zero , but includes a component which changes slowly .",
    "whenever @xmath22 , therefore , the coupling may indeed have a more significant effect , at least for the short time during which the speed remains close to @xmath23@xcite .",
    "an effect that is only significant for a short time is not really very significant , however ; it would not count as an exception to adiabatic decoupling , which is about long - term behavior .",
    "but this is our key point , because as we will see below , when @xmath4 is near @xmath23 , the significant effect of the coupling _ can be to keep @xmath4 near @xmath23_. so instead of a transient perturbation , the nonlinear resonance at @xmath24 can induce a transition to a new dynamical phase  the driving phase . as fig .",
    "1 shows , @xmath4 can remain close to @xmath23 for a long time , until the slow mass has gained a large amount of potential energy from its steady climb up the harmonic potential @xmath25 .      to see how the daemon works",
    ", we will apply canonical transformations and adiabatic approximations to transform @xmath13 into a series of effectively equivalent @xmath27 .",
    "the first step is a canonical transformation to hamilton - jacobi variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the two fast oscillators : @xmath30 if we then discard small terms that play no significant role in the fig",
    ".  1 evolution because they are never resonant for @xmath4 near @xmath31 ( see our appendix for details ) , we obtain the adiabatic effective hamiltonian @xmath32 \\nonumber\\\\ \\kappa & = & \\frac{k}{2m\\omega\\sqrt{\\omega_{+}\\omega_{-}}}=5\\times 10^{-5}\\hbox { in fig.~1}\\;.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the angle variable @xmath33 does not appear in @xmath26 , its conjugate momentum @xmath34 is a constant of the motion under the adiabatically approximate evolution generated by @xmath26 ( hence an adiabatic invariant in the exact @xmath13 evolution )",
    ". we may therefore consider @xmath34 as a constant , whose value is given by @xmath35 , in the hamiltonian evolution of @xmath3 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "inverting ( [ aa ] ) yields @xmath39 in the case of fig .  1 .",
    "( readers who are not interested in the relationship between our model and an isolated chirikov resonance may skip directly to the next subsection . )",
    "the coupling term in @xmath26 of ( [ h2 ] ) is now similar in mathematical form to the simplest case ( an isolated resonance ) of the resonances studied by chirikov in @xcite .",
    "one apparently significant difference , however , is that our @xmath37 is a canonical variable , which evolves under the time - independent hamiltonian of the total system , whereas the corresponding variable ( also called @xmath37 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite is simply a multiple of the time , and appears as the argument of a sinusoidally time - dependent external perturbation .",
    "this difference is not really as sharply qualitative as it might seem , though , because as chirikov points out , a fixed time dependence of the form @xmath40 can always be regarded as the evolution of a dynamical variable like our own @xmath37 , if a term linear in @xmath37 s conjugate variable @xmath38 is added to the hamiltonian .",
    "as long as @xmath38 appears nowhere else in the hamiltonian , then , the equation of motion for @xmath37 will simply be @xmath41 .    with this understanding ( and",
    "after minor adaptations of notation ) we can therefore express the chirikov hamiltonian of eqn .",
    "( 3.15 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are canonically conjugate pairs .",
    "thus the first difference between our model and chirikov s is that the factor which multiplies our cosine coupling depends on @xmath38 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "we will see in section iv , below , that this dependence on @xmath38 is important in ensuring that the daemon s downconversion must eventually cease if @xmath38 is bounded from below ( _ i.e. _ our fuel source is finite ) . for the ongoing operation of the downconversion mechanism , however , this detail of coupling dependence on @xmath38 is not really significant , because our @xmath38 will only change slowly .",
    "the most basic difference between our @xmath26 and the above @xmath46 , in fact , is that in @xmath46 the slow variable @xmath47 which is coupled to the fast @xmath37 does not appear in @xmath48 , which depends only on the conjugate variable @xmath45 . in our case , in contrast , the variable coupled to @xmath37 is @xmath3 , and the slow mass s own hamiltonian includes not only a term that depends on its conjugate , @xmath36 ( namely the kinetic energy @xmath49 ) , but also a term that depends on @xmath3 itself ( the slow - sector potential energy @xmath50 ) . as we will explain just below",
    ", the precise form of this potential term in our model is not important for the downconversion mechanism ; all that really matters is that we have a sufficiently slowly varying potential @xmath51 . in this sense",
    "the chirikov resonance is a degenerate case of our daemon model , in which @xmath51 happens to vanish .",
    "as we will see further on in this section , the existence of a non - trivial potential term makes a qualitative change in our model s dynamics , in comparison with that of the isolated chirikov resonance which our model otherwise resembles .",
    "the additional potential term introduces an additional time scale , and the phenomena that occur on this long additional time scale are the main subject of this paper : the long additional time scale corresponds precisely to the rate of steady downconversion . in the chirikov limit @xmath46 , this rate goes to zero .",
    "the harmonic potential @xmath25 changes only very slightly over the period of the rapid oscillations in @xmath52 that occur during the driving phase .",
    "we can therefore understand the dynamics in this phase by replacing the harmonic potential with a linear potential whose slope @xmath53 is constant , and then after this simplified problem has been solved , replacing @xmath53 with the slowly changing slope @xmath54 of the actual harmonic potential .",
    "this yields @xmath55\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact we could apply a similar procedure to replace any sufficiently slowly varying @xmath51 , not necessarily quadratic , with an instantaneous linear potential whose slope changes slowly in comparison with the time scale that is relevant for the downconversion mechanism .",
    "we have confirmed with numerical solutions of such nonlinearly modified alternatives to @xmath13 that this procedure accurately approximates the exact evolution .",
    "we now reach a crucial point in daemon dynamics . linearizing the harmonic potential of @xmath26",
    "has given the new hamiltonian @xmath56 a first integral : @xmath57 is constant ( even though it depends explicitly on @xmath58 ! ) under the evolution generated by @xmath56 .",
    "in the adiabatically decoupled phase , @xmath59 stays constant by having @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; in the driving phase it is constant because @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for the evolution shown in fig .  1 , @xmath64 .    using the first integral @xmath59 we can reduce @xmath56 to a single non - cyclic degree of freedom by a further canonical transformation from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . with the explicit @xmath58-dependence of @xmath59 ,",
    "this is a time - dependent canonical transformation , and the transformed hamiltonian which results @xcite is @xmath69 since @xmath59 is constant , we can now treat @xmath70 as a time - dependent hamiltonian in the two - dimensional phase space @xmath71 .",
    "note in comparison that a pure chirikov resonance , with @xmath72 as in @xmath46 above , would have a time - independent hamiltonian in place of @xmath70 , as in the ` resonance hamiltonian ' @xmath73 of eqn .",
    "( 3.18 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath74-dependence of @xmath75 can be important during the dynamical transition from decoupling to driving , but during bound motion the kinetic term in @xmath70 must necessarily be smaller than the depth of the local potential minimum , and so @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the proportional contribution of @xmath77 within @xmath75 is @xmath78 .",
    "we can therefore understand both the driving and decoupled phases by neglecting @xmath77 in @xmath75 , obtaining for our final approximate adiabatic hamiltonian simply that of a single particle in a time - dependent potential : @xmath79}\\cos(k q)\\nonumber\\\\ u(t)&=&j-\\omega_{-}a - mv_{c}^{2}-gv_{c}t\\equiv u_{0}(1-\\gamma t)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we emphasize that the time - dependent effective potential @xmath80 which appears in the final approximate @xmath81 is not the same as the original slowly varying external potential @xmath50 from the full and exact @xmath13 .",
    "see our appendix for numerical confirmation that @xmath81 accurately reproduces the exact evolution under @xmath13 , as shown in fig .  1 , except for oscillations on the short @xmath82 time scale",
    ".    inserting the adiabatic time dependence @xmath83 reveals that the rate @xmath84 in @xmath85 as just defined is of order @xmath86 throughout the evolution shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this is by far the lowest rate or frequency in the entire evolution .",
    "the effective potential @xmath80 can thus be considered adiabatically , by understanding the motion implied by @xmath80 for fixed @xmath58 , and then allowing the parameters in that motion to change slowly with @xmath58 . for any fixed @xmath58",
    ", @xmath87 has the form of a tilted sinusoidal ` washboard ' ; see fig .  2 .",
    "the two dynamical phases of @xmath13 are then finally clear : for most @xmath88 orbits the slight undulations of the potential are insignificant ( adiabatic decoupling ) , but as long as the washboard tilt is not too great , there exist local minima in @xmath89 of @xmath80 , about which bound motion is possible in the surrounding local potential well .",
    "when @xmath74 thus oscillates around zero , @xmath36 oscillates slightly around @xmath90 , and hence @xmath4 oscillates slightly around the steady speed @xmath23 , as seen in fig .  1 for @xmath91 ( the driving phase ) .",
    "( these small oscillations of @xmath88 in the local well of @xmath87 are the intermediate - scale oscillations seen in the upper inset of fig .",
    "the crucial point is that by maintaining the mass s speed near @xmath23 , the rest of the system steadily does work on the mass , by raising it steadily against the @xmath92 or @xmath25 potential .",
    "this is how the daemon performs steady downconversion .",
    "[ fig3 ]   from @xmath93 , which represents @xmath13 in new canonical variables , with linearized external potential and adiabatic elimination of non - resonant terms .",
    "the time @xmath94 is chosen for illustration ; the potential looks similar for other @xmath58 during the driving phase of fig .  1 .",
    "dashed lines are horizontal guides to the eye , to confirm that shallow wells exist .",
    "unbound orbits correspond to the adiabatically decoupled phase of @xmath13 ; bound orbits , to the steady downconversion of the daemon s driving phase.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the simple picture of effective particle motion that we finally reached in @xmath95 does let us understand the daemon s driving phase in familiar terms , but only through the rather abstract variables that emerged after a series of transformations and adiabatic approximations .",
    "the hamiltonian daemon represented by @xmath13 is not a trivial system .",
    "one somewhat more physical way to understand the real nature of the steady downconversion mechanism is to consider it as a nonlinear version of the ordinary kind of resonant energy transfer , with the special nonlinear feature being that the resonance only holds for @xmath4 close to @xmath23 .",
    "as usual , therefore , energy transfer will be most efficient at exact resonance , which occurs when @xmath4 is exactly @xmath23",
    ". the mass might therefore rise stably at a speed just above @xmath23 , so that if it were to decelerate , transfer efficiency would rise and the additional force would speed the mass back up .",
    "conversely , if it were to accelerate , transfer efficiency would fall , and the mass would slow down",
    ". the nonlinear resonance can therefore be self - sustaining .",
    "this effect is an example of what is generally known as _ nonlinear stabilization _",
    "@xcite ; but the effect of the stabilization is here somewhat different from usual . ordinarily what is meant by nonlinear stabilization is that nonlinear effects _ prevent _ the secular transfer of energy between degrees of freedom . in a chirikov resonance as described by @xmath46 in ( [ chirikov315 ] ) above , for example , a linear @xmath96 would mean that resonance ( @xmath97 ) would obtain , or not obtain , throughout the whole phase space uniformly , depending only on the fixed parameters in the hamiltonian ( namely @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "if resonance does hold , therefore , the special case of linear @xmath48 allows complete transfer of energy from @xmath38 to @xmath45 . as well as being special",
    ", the case of linear @xmath48 is only a degenerate case of downconversion , because the designation of @xmath37 as fast and @xmath47 as slow is in this case arbitrary : one could give the two oscillators the same frequency by the canonical rescaling @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath48 in @xmath46 is nonlinear , however , then the resonance condition @xmath103 will generally only hold for a particular value of @xmath45  just as in our case the quadratic kinetic energy @xmath104 means that resonance occurs only at @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath45 is then increased in the chirikov model , due to resonant transfer from @xmath38 , resonance no longer holds , and transfer stops .",
    "the result in the chirikov model is that @xmath45 can then only oscillate around the resonant value , with an amplitude limited by the strength of the cosine perturbation amplitude @xmath106 ; the nonlinear stabilization prevents the secular transfer of energy from @xmath38 to @xmath45 . in our case also",
    "the resonant transfer phase of evolution ( the driving phase ) sees only small oscillations of @xmath36 around the resonant value @xmath90 , and the amplitude of these oscillations is limited by our interaction strength @xmath107 . since our slow mass s energy also includes a potential term @xmath108 , however , the nearly steady maintenance of @xmath109 means that the potential energy steadily increases , through resonant transfer from @xmath38 . in our daemon model",
    ", therefore , the nonlinear stabilization of @xmath36 therefore means precisely that secular energy transfer is not prevented , but sustained .",
    "this is the basic mechanism of steady downconversion in hamiltonian daemons like the one described by our @xmath13 .",
    "the important consequence is that total energy transfer from @xmath38 to the slow mass is not limited by the strength of the coupling term , but by the total amount of available @xmath38 ( and by other constraints due to the slow @xmath84-time - scale time dependence of @xmath70 , to be described below ) .",
    "the strength of the coupling term does limit the daemon s performance ; but it limits it rather in the way that a car engine s performance is limited by its maximum torque output . a car",
    "whose engine is too weak can not climb too steep a hill .",
    "if the torque suffices for the hill s steepness , however  corresponding here to the tilt of @xmath80 being gentle enough , in relation to the well depth , that local minima still exist  then the car can keep driving uphill until it runs out of fuel .",
    "the ( mathematical ) existence of hamiltonian @xmath13 proves that hamiltonian daemons exist .",
    "how representative is @xmath13 of daemons in general ? in a word , broadly .",
    "it is representative of all daemons whose slow ` work ' degree of freedom is powered from high - frequency ` fuel ' that is not in itself chaotic , and which exploit isolated nonlinear resonances . for all such systems ,",
    "the high - frequency sector can be represented without loss of generality with hamilton - jacobi co - ordinates @xmath44 , plus as many additional co - ordinates @xmath110 as may be needed for all the high - frequency degrees of freedom . since the hamilton - jacobi construction makes the @xmath110 time - independent under the evolution generated by @xmath38 alone , the @xmath110 can only evolve under the hamiltonian terms which couple @xmath38 to the slow degree of freedom .",
    "these terms have to be small , because we can only identify the slow and fast degrees of freedom as such by overlooking their coupling on the grounds that it is weak .",
    "the @xmath110 variables will therefore evolve slowly under the full daemon @xmath111 , and so considerations of resonance and adiabatic invariance like those applied to @xmath13 will also lead , for a large class of daemon systems , to explicitly time - dependent adiabatic invariants like @xmath59 , and thus to time - dependent effective hamiltonians of the forms of @xmath70 and @xmath81 .",
    "the potential function @xmath87 may be different in its dependence on @xmath112 as well as on @xmath89 , and it may have further slow time dependence through its dependence on @xmath110 variables . the basic scenario , of steady downconversion maintained by cyclic orbits in an effective potential , will remain the same .",
    "in particular it is interesting to note that daemons are generically dynamical systems with at least three important time scales . by their definition",
    "they have an important short time scale , analogous to @xmath113 in @xmath13 . also by the definition of steady downconversion",
    ", they must have a much longer time scale , analogous to @xmath114 in @xmath81 , over which the high - frequency energy is transferred into slower motion .",
    "the steady slowness of this transfer is ultimately also due to the smallness of the interaction between the slow and fast subsystems ; if it were not so slow , then the energy transfer would not really be analogous to the steady downconversion of an engine , but to the explosively non - steady downconversion of a bomb .",
    "it is the intermediate third time scale which is surprising here : the period of effectively bound motion during the driving phase , as shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "the generic requirement for ( adiabatically ) periodic motion of this kind is clear from the nature of dynamical stabilization : hamiltonian systems maintain a steady average speed by oscillating around it .",
    "if we label the oscillation frequency with @xmath115 , then the weakness of coupling must imply @xmath116 , while the steadiness of downconversion implies @xmath117 .",
    "daemons are thus examples of multiple - time - scale systems in which three distinct time scales are simultaneously important .",
    "whether by coincidence or not , the essential feature of steady periodic motion in a daemon s driving phase is analogous to the cyclic operation of a macroscopic engine .",
    "we represent this fact provocatively in fig .  3 by comparing @xmath99 , @xmath115 , and @xmath84 to the analogous rate scales of a motor .",
    "daemons are thus a large class of systems , but very many of them can be mapped onto systems similar to the one presented here .",
    "the exploration of possible exceptions and generalizations must be left for future work . here",
    "we will turn instead to examining an important general feature of daemons which can also be understood from the behavior of @xmath13 .",
    "how and why do daemon driving phases end ?    [ fig2 ]",
    "the explicit slow @xmath118 time dependence of @xmath81 is _ not _ any kind of heuristic modification of the system dynamics , but is due entirely to the time - dependent transformation which replaced @xmath38 with @xmath59 .",
    "that step , which produced @xmath70 from the time - independent @xmath56 , was an exact canonical transformation .",
    "since as a result @xmath81 is explicitly time - dependent , it is not conserved ; but the original energy @xmath13 still is conserved . indeed @xmath81 is time - dependent precisely _ because _ @xmath13 is conserved , since the explicit time dependence of the adiabatic invariant @xmath119 reflects the fact that if @xmath109 remains ( nearly ) constant despite the external force @xmath120 , then @xmath38 must decrease steadily to supply the needed power @xmath121 .",
    "it should therefore be no surprise that it is the slow time dependence of @xmath80 in @xmath81 which makes the daemon stop driving when it runs out of @xmath38 ` fuel ' . and",
    "analogous phenomena will be observed in any analogous daemon system .    in fact",
    "the @xmath81 daemon must in general stop _ before _",

    "4 shows , possibly much lower ) than the limits set by energy conservation , or by the maximum force that can be exerted by the coupling term in @xmath13 .",
    "this limitation is moreover inevitable , because it is inherent in the time scale hierarchy that defines a daemon , as sketched in fig .",
    "this generic daemon time scale hierarchy means that @xmath127 must be adiabatically invariant , and limit the duration of steady downconversion to be less than what would be allowed by conservation of energy alone .",
    "the main result of this paper has been to prove by example that hamiltonian daemons are in principle possible ; small dynamical systems can sustain steady energy transfer from rapid motions to slow . we have also found a non - trivial limit on the amount of work that our example daemon can do , and as we have argued that our example daemon is a representative example of a large class of daemon systems , we have shown that this kind of efficiency limit is a generic feature of steady downconversion in small hamiltonian systems .",
    "small dynamical systems have traditionally been studied as toy models for more general phenomena , however . since the behavior of daemons is at this level analogous to that of combustion engines , and",
    "since heat is after all fundamentally nothing but a certain rapid ` kind of motion ' @xcite , we close our paper by discussing the possible implications of our results for the microscopic roots of thermodynamics .      the fact that hamiltonian daemons can in general do less work than the limit allowed by energy conservation , because a certain phase space volume can not decrease , is reminiscent of the thermodynamic limits on heat engine efficiency , which not only insist on conservation of total energy , but further say that not all energy is thermodynamically ` available ' for conversion into work , because entropy can not decrease . in the statistical mechanics of the microcanonical ensemble , entropy is identified with ( the logarithm of ) a certain phase space volume ( namely , that volume which is ergodically explored by the system as it undergoes chaotic evolution ) .",
    "it is therefore intriguing to speculate whether the mechanical constraints on hamiltonian daemons , in which conservation of certain phase space volumes limits energy transfer , may perhaps be related somehow to the constraints of thermodynamics , whose microscopic origins remain obscure",
    ".    further investigations can moreover demonstrate additional analogies between daemon mechanics and thermodynamics , in the constraints on daemon ignition , and in entanglement growth in quantum mechanical daemons ; these results are reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "these analogies may even prompt an alternative hypothesis to the long - standing assumption that thermodynamics somehow ` emerges ' , at mesoscopic scales , from non - thermodynamical microphysics .",
    "the alternative is that perhaps thermodynamics does nt begin at mesoscopic scales , but simply persists into macroscopic scales from microscopic mechanics , where it already exists in embryonic form as the set of dynamical constraints upon steady downconversion .",
    "on the other hand we must note that all the constraints on hamiltonian daemons obtain within closed - system hamiltonian mechanics , even without chaos or disorder . while the constraints on daemons may therefore resemble thermodynamics in their practical consequences",
    ", the reasons why the constraints apply would seem to be different .",
    "for the constraint that we have identified in this paper , for example , the difference between statistical mechanical entropy and the adiabatic invariant @xmath127 is drastic in a basic respect : the phase space area involved in limiting daemons does _ not _ represent a volume that is ergodically explored by the system .",
    "the system s orbit under @xmath81 _ encloses _ the area @xmath127 , but it does not even enter the area @xmath127 , let alone ergodically fill it . the concept of ergodic filling is fundamental in statistical mechanics , and if ergodic filling is really irrelevant to the mechanical constraints on steady downconversion , then the relationship between limits on daemons and thermodynamics may go beyond statistical mechanics itself , and lead either to an extension of thermodynamics into smaller systems ( ` microthermodynamics ' ) , or the embedding of thermodynamics within a larger class of analogous constraints .      should we really be certain , in any case , that statistical mechanics is the whole story of how thermodynamics emerges from mechanics ?",
    "statistical mechanics is based on introducing ensembles to provide ` coarse - grained ' descriptions , which contain no information about any aspects of time evolution that are rapidly ergodic . in this sense",
    "the first question that statistical mechanics addresses is about the exchange of _ information _ between fast and slow variables , and its first answer is that equilibration occurs : information can be effectively lost from the slow sector , even though the total evolution is liouvillian ( or in quantum mechanics , unitary ) .",
    "questions about energy exchange are then most often treated in a second step , in the sense that one studies energy transport under local ( but not global ) equilibrium , or postulates ` baths ' or ` reservoirs ' as sinks or sources of energy that always remain in equilibrium .",
    "active research continues into how information can thus effectively be lost within deterministic time evolution , and the physics of information is a major topic in general . by no means",
    "do we question the profound importance of information in physics ; but we would argue also for the alternative approach , of considering energy exchange as the first question , instead of equilibration .",
    "thermodynamics is after all a practical discipline , and engines do not exist to equilibrate , but to perform large amounts of steady work from compact fuel .",
    "there is a basic physical reason why extracting large amounts of work from compact fuel demands downconversion : the units of energy are mass @xmath135 ( length)@xmath136 / ( time)@xmath136 , and so a source of energy which is rich in comparison to its size and mass must possess a short time scale .",
    "it may therefore be worthwhile , as a kind of second front in the struggle to understand the microscopic roots of thermodynamics , to re - phrase the basic question . instead of asking _ how can steady",
    "work be extracted from the equilibrated degrees of freedom of a heat bath ?",
    "_ , we can ask _ how can steady work be extracted from high - frequency degrees of freedom ?",
    "_ further investigations of hamiltonian daemons and related systems may thereby shed further light on thermodynamics",
    ".    understanding hamiltonian daemons may potentially even be practical .",
    "chemical reactions are a ubiquitous source of this kind of dense energy , and the general problem of transferring their high - frequency energy into much slower motions is one that is not only solved macroscopically by engines , but also ( somehow ) by living organisms , on much smaller scales . whether dynamical limitations on steady downconversion in small systems prove to be a microscopic limit of thermodynamics , or whether they turn out to be a parallel set of constraints , they may conceivably be of comparable importance to thermodynamics , for molecular machines @xcite .",
    "of course natural molecular machines are not isolated systems as daemons are , and any future artificial microscopic machines will also have to tolerate dissipation and noise if they are to be useful .",
    "we have only defined daemons as isolated , however , in order to ensure that they do not _ need _ external power in order to operate .",
    "the adiabatic mechanisms by which daemons operate are normally quite robust , and so a generalized daemon , which was subject to dissipation and noise from its environment , might still very well function .",
    "if so , the processes of self - contained steady downconversion as by daemons , and work extraction from baths as by heat engines , may prove to be alternatives that are compatible  or even to be alternative limits of a single phenomenon .",
