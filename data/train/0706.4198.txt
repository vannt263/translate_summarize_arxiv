    "the masses of the lightest known particles ( neutrinos ) are best constrained by the largest known scales ( the entire universe ) . the well - established method of using cosmological precision data to constrain the cosmic hot dark matter fraction  @xcite has been extended to hypothetical low - mass particles , notably to axions , in several papers  @xcite .",
    "we return to this topic to extend previous studies by some of us  @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we update the cosmological data sets to include the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 3-year data as well as the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the sloan digital sky survey that have since become available .",
    "second , we use standard bayesian inference techniques to construct credible regions in parameter space , in contrast to the likelihood maximisation method used before  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , we consider a two - component hot dark matter fraction consisting of axions and neutrinos . since neutrinos are known to have nonvanishing masses , their hot - dark matter contribution is an unavoidable cosmological fit parameter .",
    "axions and neutrinos decouple at different epochs and thus have different velocity dispersions that we implement self - consistently . in this regard our work parallels a recent study by another group  @xcite .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : axions ] with a brief summary of the relevant axion parameters and their decoupling conditions . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the cosmological model and the parameter space we use . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] we summarise the included data sets and briefly discuss our reasons for limiting the analysis to data in the safely linear regime of structure formation .",
    "we derive our new constraints in section  [ sec : results ] before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the peccei  quinn solution of the cp problem of strong interactions predicts the existence of axions , low - mass pseudoscalars that are very similar to neutral pions , except that their mass and interaction strengths are suppressed by a factor of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6  mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath7 a large energy scale , the axion decay constant or peccei  quinn scale  @xcite . in more detail ,",
    "the axion mass  is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass ratio of the up and down quarks .",
    "we will follow the previous axion literature and assume a value @xmath10 @xcite , but we note that it could vary in the range 0.30.6 @xcite . because of this uncertainty and to cover more general cases we will sometimes include a fudge factor @xmath11 with the standard value  1 .",
    "we will consider cases with @xmath12 .    a large range of @xmath7 values ( or , equivalently , @xmath1 values ) can be excluded by experiments and by astrophysical and cosmological arguments  @xcite .",
    "axions with a mass of order 10  @xmath13ev could well be the cold dark matter of the universe  @xcite and if so will be found eventually by the ongoing admx experiment provided that @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a hot axion population is produced by thermal processes  @xcite .",
    "axions attain thermal equilibrium at the qcd phase transition or later if @xmath15  gev , erasing the cold axion population produced earlier and providing a hot dark matter component instead .    in principle , @xmath16  gev is excluded by the supernova sn  1987a neutrino burst duration  @xcite .",
    "however , the sparse data sample , our poor understanding of the nuclear medium in the supernova interior , and simple prudence suggest that one should not base far - reaching conclusions about the existence of axions in this parameter range on a single argument or experiment alone .",
    "therefore , it remains important to tap other sources of information , especially if they are easily available .",
    "for those axion models with nonvanishing couplings to charged fermions , there exist stellar energy loss limits based on the axion ",
    "electron coupling that are competitive with the sn  1987a constraints so that here one does not rely on a single argument to exclude axions in the @xmath16  gev range .",
    "therefore , we focus on hadronic models where axions do not directly couple to ordinary quarks and leptons . in this class of models",
    "all axion properties depend on @xmath7 alone and not on model - dependent peccei",
    " quinn charges of the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "if axions do not couple to charged leptons , the main thermalisation process in the post - qcd epoch is  @xcite @xmath17 the axion ",
    "pion interaction is given by a lagrangian of the form  @xcite @xmath18 in hadronic axion models , the coupling constant is  @xcite @xmath19 we note that in general the chiral symmetry - breaking lagrangian gives rise to an additional piece for @xmath20 proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "however , for hadronic axion models this term vanishes identically , in contrast , for example , to the dfsz model ( roberto peccei , private communication ) .    based on the axion ",
    "pion interaction , the axion decoupling temperature in the early universe was calculated by some of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all relevant details are reported . in our standard case",
    "we use the axion mass @xmath1 as our primary parameter from which we derive the corresponding axion",
    " pion interaction strength by virtue of equations  ( [ eq : axmass ] ) and  ( [ eq : pionprocess ] ) .",
    "noting that even in hadronic axion models there is some uncertainty in this relationship due to the uncertain quark - mass ratio @xmath22 , we consider also more general cases in which we include a fudge factor @xmath11 as defined in equation  ( [ eq : axmass ] ) , thus allowing for a more general relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "we consider a cosmological model with vanishing spatial curvature and adiabatic initial conditions , described by nine free parameters , @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the physical dark matter density , @xmath26 the baryon density , @xmath27 the hubble parameter , @xmath28 the optical depth to reionisation , @xmath29 the amplitude of the primordial scalar power spectrum , and @xmath30 its spectral index .",
    "these six parameters represent the simplest parameter set necessary for a consistent interpretation of the currently available data .    in addition",
    ", we allow for a nonzero sum of neutrino masses @xmath31 , a nonvanishing axion mass @xmath1 , and a fudge factor @xmath11 relating @xmath1 to @xmath7 as defined in equation  ( [ eq : axmass ] ) .",
    "these extra parameters will be varied one at a time , as well as in combination .",
    "their `` standard '' values are given in table  [ tab : priors ] , along with the priors for all cosmological fit parameters considered here .",
    "we use cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment after three years of observation @xcite .",
    "the data analysis is performed using version  2 of the likelihood calculation package provided by the wmap team on the lambda homepage @xcite .",
    "we use the large - scale galaxy power spectra @xmath32 inferred from the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and from the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df )  @xcite .",
    "these power spectra are related to the underlying matter power spectrum @xmath33 via @xmath34 , where the galaxy bias @xmath35 is conventionally assumed to be constant with respect to @xmath36 over the scales probed by galaxy clustering surveys .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that this assumption may break down beyond @xmath37 , and may source the apparent tension between the sdss and the 2df - inferred galaxy power spectra  @xcite . to model the effects of scale - dependent biasing when extracting cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering data , both the sdss - lrg and the 2df teams advocate the use of the @xmath38 fitting formula developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath39cdm cosmologies .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .    in the present work , however , we take the view that fitting formulae developed for standard cosmologies may not be applicable in nonstandard scenarios , particularly those involving new length scales arising from , e.g. , axion and neutrino free - streaming . developing an alternative formula to properly handle these nonstandard effects on the galaxy bias is also beyond our present scope .",
    "we therefore adopt a conservative approach , and use only power spectrum data well below @xmath37 , where a scale-_independent _ bias is likely to hold true :    * 2df , @xmath40 ( 17 bands ) , * sdss - lrg , @xmath41 ( 11 bands )",
    ".    the combined set of these data is denoted lss .",
    "we assume a scale - independent bias for each data set , and marginalise analytically over each bias parameter @xmath42 with a flat prior .      the baryon acoustic oscillations peak has been measured in the sdss luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "we use all 20  points in the two - point correlation data set supplied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the analysis procedure described therein , including power spectrum dewiggling , nonlinear corrections with the halofit package  @xcite , corrections for redshift - space distortion , and analytic marginalisation over the normalisation of the correlation function .",
    "we use the luminosity distance measurements of distant type  ia supernovae provided by davis et  al .",
    "this sample is a compilation of supernovae measured by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite , the essence project @xcite , and the hubble space telescope @xcite , as well as a set of 45 nearby supernovae . in total",
    "the sample contains 192 supernovae .",
    "measurements of the flux power spectrum of the lyman-@xmath0 forest has been used to reconstruct the matter power spectrum on small scales at large redshifts . by far the largest sample of spectra",
    "comes from the sdss survey .",
    "this data set was carefully analysed in mcdonald et  al .",
    "@xcite and used to constrain the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the derived linear fluctuation amplitude at @xmath43 and @xmath44 is @xmath45 , and the effective spectral index @xmath46 .",
    "these results were derived using a very elaborate model of the local intergalactic medium in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "while the ly@xmath0 data provide in principle a very powerful probe of the fluctuation amplitude on small scales , the question remains as to the level of systematic uncertainty in the result .",
    "the same data have been reanalysed by seljak et  al .",
    "@xcite and viel et  al .",
    "@xcite , with somewhat different results . specifically , the normalisation found in refs .",
    "@xcite is lower than that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this question of normalisation is particularly important for bounds on the hot dark matter content of the universe . since the free - streaming scale of light neutrinos or axions is larger than the length scale probed by ly@xmath0 , their effect on the ly@xmath0 data amounts to an overall change in the normalisation that is completely degenerate with any possible shift due to systematics . the ly@xmath0 analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite already points to a higher fluctuation amplitude @xmath47 than that derived from the wmap 3-year data ; the addition of a hot dark matter component will render the two data sets even less compatible .",
    "this incompatibility in turn leads to a much stronger formal bound on the mass of the hot dark matter particle than would be expected considering the sensitivity of the present data ( this is true for both neutrinos and other types of hot dark matter , such as axions ) .",
    "these considerations suggest that the ly@xmath0 data are at present dominated by systematic effects .",
    "we therefore refrain from using them in the present analysis .",
    "we use standard bayesian inference techniques , and explore the model parameter space with monte carlo markov chains ( mcmc ) generated using the publicly available cosmomc package  @xcite .",
    "our results are summarised in tables  [ tab : fudge ] and [ tab : fudge1d ] , and figures  [ fig : mamnu ] and [ fig : mafudge ] .",
    "-@xmath1 plane derived from the full data set wmap+lss+bao+snia .",
    "the blue / solid lines correspond to the fudge factor being fixed at @xmath48 , while the red / dashed lines indicate a top - hat prior on @xmath11 in the interval @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : mamnu ] ]    for the case of a standard hadronic axion our bounds on @xmath2 and @xmath1 are tabulated in table  [ tab : fudge ] .",
    "when bao data are included our bounds are almost identical to those recently derived in ref .",
    "@xcite based on their conservative data set .",
    "the main difference is that we do not use the hst prior on @xmath50 , but instead include the sdss - bao data .",
    "since the bao data break the @xmath51-@xmath50 degeneracy , their inclusion has much the same effect as adding the hst prior .",
    "the importance of bao data for the bound can be seen by the fact that the 95% upper bound is reduced from @xmath52  ev to @xmath53  ev .",
    "our complete snia data set is also somewhat larger than the snls data set used in ref .",
    "@xcite , containing in addition data from the goods and essence surveys .",
    "however , this has only a very modest impact on our results .",
    "our neutrino mass bound @xmath54  ev ( 95% c.l . ) in the absence of axions is identical to that derived by some of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the axion mass limit @xmath55  ev in the absence of neutrino masses found here is significantly weaker than the @xmath56  ev limit found earlier  @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the neutrino mass limits is coincidental because here we use different data , notably excluding the lyman-@xmath0 forest , and a different statistical methodology ( marginalisation instead of maximisation ) .",
    "the relative difference between the limits can be interpreted such that the axion bound benefits more from the inclusion of small - scale data than the neutrino mass bound , presumably because axions freeze out earlier and thus have a smaller velocity dispersion . including the ly@xmath0 data here",
    "would strongly improve both limits as can be gleaned from the results of ref .",
    "adding ly@xmath0 to their conservative data set , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite finds that the marginalised axion mass limit improves by a factor 0.30 , whereas the marginalised neutrino mass limit improves only by a factor 0.36 , i.e. , the relative gain for axions is 20% stronger .",
    "the changes in our new limits relative to those of ref .",
    "@xcite are in agreement with this picture .",
    "returning to our new limits , an important observation is that the upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses is largely independent of whether or not massive axions are present .",
    "the 95% upper limit on @xmath2 is in either case approximately @xmath57  ev , a bound very close to that found in previous studies using roughly the same data combination @xcite .",
    "-@xmath58 plane , assuming a top - hat prior on the fudge factor in the interval @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : mafudge ] ]    in figure 2 we show how the bound on the axion mass changes as @xmath11 is allowed to vary up or down by up to a factor of  10 , assuming a uniform prior on @xmath58 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that the figure shows the 2d marginal contours , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath1 are fitted simultaneously . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the bound on @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath11 because the number of degrees of freedom at decoupling , @xmath62 , is approximately constant for a large range of @xmath7 values ( see table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the value of @xmath62 increases significantly with increasing @xmath11 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "this increase in @xmath62 leads to a corresponding drop in the present axion number density , @xmath64 for a fixed @xmath1 this amounts to a decrease in the ratio @xmath65 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the bound on @xmath1 therefore becomes correspondingly weaker .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mafudge ] , the 2d marginal 95% upper limit on @xmath1 stays roughly constant at when @xmath61 , and increases roughly linearly with @xmath58 to about @xmath66  ev at @xmath67 .",
    "we stress again that the @xmath1 bounds in this figure are 2d bounds , and are formally  and often also in practice  not equivalent to 1d bounds on @xmath1 derived under the assumption of a fixed @xmath11 . for instance , the 2d bound on @xmath1 at @xmath68 in figure  [ fig : mafudge ] is not exactly identical to the 1d bound quoted in table  [ tab : fudge ] for a fixed @xmath68 . however , despite this formality , the @xmath1-@xmath58 trend observed in figure  [ fig : mafudge ] is also evident in table  [ tab : fudge1d ] , which shows the 1d marginal 68% and 95% bounds on @xmath1 for _ fixed _ values of @xmath11 .    finally , we note that if @xmath11 is increased much beyond 10 , the bound will deteriorate rapidly because axion decoupling will have occurred beyond the qcd phase transition .",
    "we have updated previous limits from cosmological structure formation on the mass of hot dark matter axions .",
    "this limit applies to axions which were thermalised , mainly by axion ",
    "pion interactions , in the early universe , and which subsequently decoupled from the thermal plasma while still relativistic .    in the present study",
    "we investigate both the case where the neutrinos can be regarded as massless , as well as the case in which massive neutrinos are also allowed to contribute significantly to the hot dark matter fraction . in both cases",
    "we find an upper 95% limit on the mass of hadronic axions of @xmath69@xmath53  ev when all available cosmological data , except the lyman-@xmath0 forest , are used .",
    "reassuringly , we find that the bound on the sum of neutrino masses is almost completely unaffected by the presence of hot dark matter axions .    because of the uncertainty in the relation between the axion mass @xmath1 and the energy scale @xmath7 , we have also studied the case in which the relation @xmath70 is modified by a fudge factor @xmath11 .",
    "we have studied @xmath11 in the range @xmath71@xmath72 , which is fairly representative of the model uncertainties .",
    "we find that the axion mass bound is largely stable with respect to varying @xmath11 in this range . for fixed values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the 1d marginal bound on @xmath1 goes from 0.98  ev at @xmath73 to 1.4  ev at @xmath74 .",
    "essentially , this means that for hadronic axion models the uncertainty of the light quark mass ratios have a negligible impact on the axion mass limit .",
    "experimental and astrophysical limits on @xmath1 or @xmath7 are always derived from limits on the axion coupling to different particles .",
    "the cosmological hot dark matter limit , in contrast , primarily constrains the axion mass , with a very weak dependence on the axion  pion coupling .",
    "the hot dark matter limit of @xmath75  ev is very similar to the limit derived from globular cluster stars based on the axion  photon coupling",
    ". however , this coupling is quite uncertain even in hadronic models because even there it depends on the unknown electric charge of the heavy quark in ksvz - type models .",
    "the hot dark matter limit implies that it is very difficult to escape the limit @xmath75  ev .",
    "one consequence is that in typical models , axions in the remaining allowed mass range necessarily escape freely from a supernova core . by courtesy of the sn  1987a neutrino burst duration",
    ", it follows that one can advance by another rung in the ladder of different limits and conclude that @xmath76  ev @xcite .",
    "while this sn  1987a energy - loss limit does not have an obvious loophole , we repeat that it is based on a very small sample of detected neutrinos and is subject to various nuclear - physics and axion - model uncertainties .",
    "our results largely agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite for their conservative data set .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite and to a previous study by some of us  @xcite , we have not included the lyman-@xmath0 forest data which could formally improve both the neutrino and axion mass limits roughly by a factor of  3 .",
    "we have explained in section  [ sec : lya ] that using the lyman-@xmath0 forest exposes one to the risk that large systematic uncertainties in the normalisation of the power spectrum at small scales may dominate the final result .    the cast experiment at cern searches for axion - like particles emitted by the sun by virtue of their coupling to photons  @xcite .",
    "by including a helium filling of the magnet bores with variable pressure one can `` adjust the photon mass , '' thereby allowing one to probe realistic combinations of @xmath1 and axion  photon coupling .",
    "the completed runs with @xmath77he filling have already extended the experimental sensitivity to @xmath78  ev .",
    "further extensions to up to @xmath79  ev with the forthcoming @xmath80he runs over three years are on the agenda  @xcite .",
    "this search range is not excluded by our limits , particularly as we believe that more restrictive limits derived from the lyman-@xmath0 forest may be dominated by systematic effects that are not reliably controlled .",
    "one further caveat is that limits inferred from cosmological observations are by and large model - dependent .",
    "additional free parameters not considered in this work , such as a nonstandard dark energy equation of state parameter , running in the primordial scalar spectral index , or a nonzero component of isocurvature modes in the initial conditions , could conceivably loosen the axion mass bound , as they have done many times before for the neutrino mass limit @xcite .",
    "a significant and reliable improvement of cosmological hot dark matter limits is not immediately forthcoming .",
    "however , once data from the planck cmb experiment @xcite combined with other probes such as weak lensing surveys of galaxies @xcite or of 21-cm emissions @xcite , or high - redshift galaxy surveys @xcite become available , the sensitivity will be pushed down by as mush as an order of magnitude even in the face of more complicated cosmological model frameworks . in that event",
    ", a detection of axions by cast in the vicinity of @xmath81  ev will have important ramifications for observational cosmology .",
