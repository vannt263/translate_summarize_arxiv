    "nonholonomic constraints on field models are receiving increasing attention in recent years nholn . as a notable achievement",
    "such nonholonomic deformation ( nhd ) has been applied to an integrable system , namely to the kdv equation preserving its integrability 6kdv . for this system ,",
    "equivalent to a 6th order kdv equation , certain particular traveling wave solutions are found , a linear problem is formulated and several conjectures on important issues are put forward in 6kdv .",
    "the main expectations for this kdv equation with nonholonomic constraint are : i ) existence of an infinite set of higher conserved quantities , ii ) formulation of the lax pair iii ) application of the inverse scattering method ( ism ) , iv ) n - soliton solutions for the basic and the deforming field , v ) elastic nature of soliton scattering etc . among these conjectures",
    "only the first one showing the existence of an integrable hierarchy with usual higher dispersion is proved recently kup08 .",
    "our aim here is to establish the rest with explicit result .",
    "in particular we construct akns type matrix lax pair for this nhd of the kdv equation , revealing an important connection between the time evolution of the jost function and the nhd of the nonlinear equation . applying subsequently the ism we find the exact n - soliton solutions for both the field and the deforming function of the deformed kdv , which exhibit the usual property of soliton scattering , but with an unusual accelerating ( or decelerating ) soliton motion .",
    "finally we unravel a novel two - fold integrable hierarchy for this system , one with the usual higher dispersion kup08 and the other yielding a new type of deformed kdv with increasingly higher order nonholonomic constraints .",
    "recently proposed 6kdv nhd of the kdv equation u_t - u_xxx-6uu_x & = & w_x , + w_xxx+4u w_x+2u_x w & = & 0 , can be written by eliminating deforming function @xmath0 , also as a 6th order kdv equation for @xmath1 : ( ^3_xxx+4v_x _ x+2v_xx)(v_t - v_xxx-3 v^2_x)=0 .",
    "we intend to find the exact n - soliton solutions to the deformed kdv equation ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) for the field @xmath2 and the deforming function @xmath0 by the ism , for which we construct first the akns type lax pair @xmath3 to formulate the linear problem @xmath4 .",
    "we observe remarkably , that such a lax pair for the deformed kdv can be build up from the known pair @xmath5 for the standard kdv equation olit1 , by _ deforming _ only its time - lax operator : u()= u_kdv ( ) ,   v()=v_kdv()+v_def ( ) , where the deforming operator is given as v_def()=1 2 ( ^-1g^(1)+ ^-2g^(2 ) ) with g^(1)&=&i w ^3- w_x ^+ + g^(2)&= & 2 ^3 + i w ^-+ e^+ ,  e_x = iu w_x . here",
    "@xmath6 is the kdv field and @xmath7 is the deforming function with its asymptotic @xmath8 , being an arbitrary function in time .",
    "we can check that the flatness condition @xmath9=0 $ ] of the lax pair ( [ ladef ] ) yields the deformed kdv equation ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) , where the undeformed part is given by the standard pair olit1 u_kdv()&=&i ( ^3 + u^(0 ) ) ,  u^(0 ) = u(x , t)^++ ^- + v_kdv()&= & iu^(0)_xx-4i^3 ^ 3 + 2 ^3 ( -u^(0)_x+i(u^(0))^2 ) -4i u^(0)^2 + & + & 2i ( u^(0))^3 - [ u^(0 ) , u^(0)_x ] , while the deformed part with the nonholonomic constraint is generated by the new addition ( [ vdef ] ) .",
    "therefore we may draw an intriguing conclusion that the nhd of the kdv ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) can be linked to the deformation in the time evolution of the jost function , which is related to @xmath10 as given by ( [ vdef]-[g12 ] ) .",
    "we see in the sequel that this fact leads to an unusual solitonic property in the deformed kdv , namely the possibility of ac(de)celerated soliton motion .      for the deformed kdv equation ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) no exact solution , except a few particular solutions , could be found 6kdv .",
    "we derive for the same equation exact n - soliton solutions , which is a clear signature of complete integrability of a nonlinear system .",
    "it is important to note that , the evolution of the basic kdv field @xmath11 is sustained here from two different sources : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first one is generated by the standard dispersive and nonlinear terms in equation ( [ kdvs ] ) , while the second one is sourced by the deforming term @xmath14 . therefore the deforming function @xmath15 satisfying the nonholonomic constraint ( [ kdvee ] ) , can be determined self - consistently through the kdv field as w(x , t)=",
    "c(t ) u_c(t ) dx + c(t ) , where the arbitrary function @xmath16 acting as a forcing term sitting at the space boundaries @xmath17 arises as an integration constant .    therefore we can find by applying the ism the exact soliton solutions for the basic as well as for the perturbing field , interdependent on each other . recall that in using the ism through the associated linear problem , the space - lax operator @xmath18 describing the scattering of the jost functions , plays the key role . only at the final stage",
    "we need to fix the time evolution of the solitons through the time - dependence of the spectral data , determined in turn by the asymptotic value of the time - lax operator @xmath19 .",
    "note that since in the case of the deformed kdv equation the space - lax operator ( [ ladef ] ) is given by the same operator as in the standard kdv ( [ ukdv ] ) , the steps for its ism follows the same initial path as for the kdv equation olit1 . therefore referring the readers to the original literatures for details we produce the explicit form of the n - soliton for the kdv field @xmath20 as an exact solution to the deformed system ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) , or equivalently to the 6th order kdv ( [ 6kdv ] ) as u_n(x)=2 det a(x ) where the matrix function @xmath21 is expressed through its elements as a_nm=_nm+ e^-(_n+_m)x here parameters @xmath22 , denote the time - independent zeros of the scattering matrix element @xmath23 , along the imaginary axis : @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the time - dependent spectral data to be determined from @xmath26 , at @xmath27 .",
    "we notice that due to @xmath28 at @xmath27 , the asymptotic value of ( [ vkdv ] ) : @xmath29 is the usual one , while that of @xmath30 determines the crucial effect of the deformation . as a result",
    "we obtain _",
    "n(t)=_n(0 ) e^-(8_n^3 t - ) ,  c_t= c determining finally the evolution of the soliton through ( [ an ] ) .",
    "the exact n - soliton solution for the deforming function @xmath31 , induced through ( [ w - u ] ) by the solution of the basic field ( [ nsol ] ) , therefore can be given by w_n(x , t)=2 c(t ) ( det a(x , t ) ) + c(t ) , where @xmath32 is the same matrix function ( [ an ] ) with its time - dependence ( [ bett ] ) .    to examine the deforming effect on solitons in more detail",
    "we analyze particular cases of solution ( [ nsol ] ) and ( [ nsolw ] ) for @xmath33 .",
    "1-_soliton _ solution of nhd of the kdv equation as reduced from ( [ nsol]-[nsolw ] ) can be expressed as u_1(x , t)&= & 2 sech^2 ,    = ( x+vt)+ , + w_1(x , t)&=&c(t)(1- sech^2 ) , with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the usual constant kdv soliton velocity , while @xmath36 is its unusual time dependent part induced by the deformation .",
    "we stress again that the deforming function is determined by the dynamics of the field @xmath37 , which in turn is forced self - consistently by the deforming field . inserting the explicit soliton solutions ( [ 1s ] , [ 1sw ] ) for both @xmath2 and @xmath0 in the nonholonomic deformation of the kdv ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) one can directly check the validity of these exact solutions .",
    "notice that the time - dependent asymptotic value of the deformation : @xmath38 acts here like a forcing term sitting at the space boundaries , which for @xmath39 with @xmath40 forces the soliton to accelerate , while with @xmath41 makes the soliton to decelerate and finally revert its direction ( see fig .",
    "it can also be noted that less the original soliton velocity @xmath42 , more is the deforming velocity @xmath43 , which is physically consistent since the forcing term in general must have more prominent effect on slow moving solitons .",
    "the exact 2-_soliton _ in the deformed kdv can be derived similarly from ( [ nsol]-[nsolw ] ) with @xmath44 in the explicit form : u_2(x , t)&= & ( d_xxd - d_x^2 ) ,   d=1+e^-_1+e^-_2 + p_12e^-(_1+_2 ) + w_2(x , t)&= & c(t ) ( 1 + ( dd_x - d d_x ) ) ,  d= 1 _ 1e^-_1 + 1 _ 2 e^-_2 + p_12(1 _ 1 + 1 _ 2 ) e^-(_1+_2 ) where the scattering amplitude @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the usual constant soliton velocities @xmath48 of the kdv equation is boosted here by time - dependent velocities @xmath49 , caused by the nonholonomic deformation .",
    "the scattering of solitons for the field @xmath50 as described by the solution ( [ 2su ] ) with @xmath51 is depicted in fig .",

    "the well known integrable hierarchy of the standard kdv equation is given by olit1 @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the higher hamiltonians of the kdv hierarchy , e.g. @xmath56 etc .",
    ", with @xmath57 yielding the kdv equation .",
    "as has been shown in kup08 an integrable hierarchy with the same hamiltonians exists also for the deformed kdv equation with nhd of the equations as u_t = b_1 ( -w ) ,  b_2(w)=0 , for @xmath57 one obviously recovers the known deformed kdv equation ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) .",
    "this usual type of hierarchy with higher dispersions can be generated from the akns lax pair , where the space - lax operator remains same as the original one ( [ ukdv ] ) , but the time - lax operator is changed to @xmath58 .",
    "here the deforming part @xmath59 is the same as ( [ vdef]-[g12 ] ) , while @xmath60 is the higher generalization of ( [ vkdv ] ) , where polynomial in spectral parameter @xmath61 up to n - th power appears .",
    "such higher order time - lax operator can be constructed by expanding this matrix in the powers of @xmath61 and determining the matrix coefficients recursively from the flatness condition , as done in the standard akns treatment olit1 .",
    "another simpler solution for this problem based on the dimensional analysis and identification of the building blocks of the lax operators has been proposed recently kun08 .",
    "we discover , apart from the usual integrable hierarchy given above , an unusual hierarchy for the nonholonomic deformation of the kdv equation , which can be represented by the same deformed kdv ( [ kdvs ] ) but with higher order nonholonomic constraints on the deforming function @xmath62 .",
    "this novel integrable hierarchy can be generated as the flatness condition of a lax pair , where the space - lax operator remains as ( [ ukdv ] ) , while in the time - lax operator only the deforming part changes as @xmath63 . unlike the above kdv hierarchy , @xmath64 contains only @xmath65 powers of @xmath66 up to @xmath67 , with @xmath67-number of deforming matrix coefficients @xmath68 .",
    "the consistency condition generates this new integrable hierarchy of nonholonomic deformations given by the same deformed evolution equation ( [ kdvs ] ) , but where constraint ( [ kdvee ] ) is generalized now to n - th order through a set of coupled differential equations : u_t - u_xxx-6uu_x&= & g^(1)_12 , + g^(1)_x&=&i[u^(0),g^(1)]+i[_3 , g^(2 ) ] , +    & &   , + g^(n-1)_x&=&i[u^(0),g^(n-1)]+i[_3 , g^(n ) ] , + g^(n)_x&=&i[u^(0),g^(n ) ] .",
    "clearly this hierarchy reduces to nhd of the kdv ( [ kdvs]-[kdvee ] ) for @xmath69 , with deforming operator @xmath70 reducing to ( [ vdef]-[g12 ] ) .",
    "we prove here a number of conjectures on the recently proposed nonholonomic deformation of the kdv equation , unraveling its several unexpected features .",
    "in particular we construct akns type matrix lax pair for this deformed kdv equation , showing an intriguing connection between the deformation of the time evolution in the associated linear problem and the deformation of the nonlinear equation . applying the inverse scattering method we find exact n - soliton solutions for the basic as well as the deforming field for the deformed kdv equation , which gives also the solution of the 6th order kdv equation . such solitons exhibit in spite of",
    "the isospectral flow an unusual accelerated motion , which is however consistent with the particle motion under force .",
    "the deforming function @xmath71 , as seen from ( [ hi1 ] ) , enters in the original hierarchy of the kdv equation as a perturbation together with a nonholonomic differential constraint on it .",
    "the driving term sitting at the space - boundaries : @xmath72 , which can be an arbitrary function in time , forces the field soliton to accelerate or decelerate , with the perturbing soliton itself created by the field soliton in a self - consistent way .",
