    "in one of the most influential papers for the foundation of quantum physics  @xcite , entanglement was recognized as not `` _ one _ but rather _ the _ characteristic trait of quantum mechanics '' .",
    "although such kind of non - local correlations were thoroughly explored for the analysis of the conceptual fundaments of quantum mechanics  @xcite , the interest in understanding the properties of entangled states has received an impressive boost with the advent of quantum information .",
    "in fact it was understood that non - local correlations are responsible for the enhanced efficiency of quantum protocols  @xcite . in some other cases ,",
    "quantum teleportation just to mention an important example , quantum correlations are a necessary ingredient .",
    "entanglement can thus be considered a resource for quantum information processing .",
    "the need for defining the amount of resources required to implement a given protocol has lead to a fertile line of research in quantum information aiming at the quantification of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "to this end , necessary criteria for any entanglement measure to be fulfilled have been elaborated and lead to the notion of an entanglement monotone  @xcite .",
    "there is a fairly clear scenario in the case of bipartite systems .",
    "the multipartite counterpart is much more intricate .",
    "the large body of knowledge developed in the characterization of entanglement has found important applications in areas that , less than a decade ago , were quite distant from quantum information .",
    "this is the case of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "traditionally the characterization of many - body systems has been carried on through the study of different physical quantities ( as the magnetization in magnetic systems ) and their correlations .",
    "very little attention was paid to the structure of their quantum state and in particular to its amount of entanglement .",
    "the research at the border between these areas is rapidly evolving and has lead to numerous interesting results .",
    "the promise of this new interdisciplinary field is twofold : firstly , to improve our understanding of strongly correlated systems , beyond the current state of the art ; and secondly , to control and manipulate quantum correlations to our convenience , ultimately with the hope of making an impact on the computation schemes to solve hard problems in computer science .",
    "methods developed in quantum information have proven to be extremely useful in the analysis of the state of many - body systems . at the same time experience built up over the years in condensed matter",
    "is helping in finding new protocols for quantum computation and communication .",
    "the cross - fertilization of quantum information with statistical mechanics should not , however , come as a surprise .",
    "quantum computers are themselves many - body systems , the main difference from traditional solid - state systems is that a quantum computer can be controlled and operate under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "it is therefore natural to profit of the best instruments developed so far in the two disciplines for the understanding of quantum complex systems , being quantum computers or condensed matter systems . in this review",
    "we deal with a particular aspect of this research area : we will focus on interacting spin systems on a lattice and describe the relations between entanglement and magnetic ordering . a more detailed discussion on these issues can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a complete characterization of entanglement in a many - body system is hopeless .",
    "the number of possible ways in which the system can be partitioned explodes on increasing the number of elementary constituents ( namely spins ) . nevertheless judicious choices have made possible to highlight interesting properties of many - body correlations .",
    "numerous contributions in this volume consider a bipartition in which the system is divided into two distinct regions .",
    "if the total system is in a pure state , as when the system is in its ground state , then a measure of the entanglement between the two regions is given by the von neumann entropy associated to the reduced density matrix ( of one of the two regions ) .",
    "this is not however the only possible choice , our paper will briefly review other way to quantify entanglement whose properties contribute to our understanding of many - body systems .    in the case of bipartite entanglement one can consider the quantum correlation between two given spins after having traced out the rest of the system . in this case the entanglement between the two selected sites can be quantified by the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "the study of two - site entanglement , as we will briefly describe in the following of this paper , allows to detect quite well the presence of quantum phase transition in the phase diagram .",
    "a different approach to entanglement in many - body systems arises from the quest to swap or transmute different types of multipartite entanglement into pairwise entanglement between two parties by means of generalized measures on the rest of the system . in a system of interacting spins on a lattice",
    "this means to maximize the entanglement between two spins by performing measurements on all the others . with this aim ,",
    "the concept of localizable entanglement has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the structure of a many - body system s quantum state is by far much richer than that captured by bipartite entanglement . in the multipartite case",
    "the grounds for quantitative predictions are less firm because of the exceptional difficulty of the problem .",
    "nevertheless there are a number of very interesting results already available . among all we mention here the bounds which have been derived on the ground state energy  @xcite which allow to discriminate among different n - particle quantum correlations .",
    "the idea of deriving bounds for macroscopic quantities ( as for example the ground state energy ) is a quite powerful methods to characterize entanglement in many - body system and is related to the concept of entanglement witness . as an interesting connection between statistical mechanics and quantum information it turns out that in many cases thermodynamic quantities as the magnetization or the susceptibility ( in the case of interacting spin model ) behave as entanglement witness  @xcite thus providing a way to detect entanglement experimentally .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the natural dynamics of condensed matter systems may be important to detect bound entangled states  @xcite which are , in several cases , difficult to be realized artificially .",
    "topic of this short review is to complement the different papers in this volume by describing various measure of entanglement , other then the block entropy , which were used to characterize the equilibrium and dynamical properties of entanglement in spin systems ( see also the article by j. i. latorre and a. riera in the same volume ) . interacting spin models  @xcite provide a paradigm to describe a wide range of many - body systems",
    ". they account for the effective interactions in a variety of very different physical contexts ranging from high energy to nuclear physics . in condensed matter beside describing the properties of magnetic compounds , they capture several aspects of high - temperature superconductors , quantum hall systems , heavy fermions , just to mention few important examples",
    "of course interacting spins are central to quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we list the spin models that will be considered thereafter .",
    "then we give a brief overview of the entanglement measures that are currently used to analyze many - body systems . in the section  [ pairgr ]",
    "we discuss the main outcomes of the uses of this entanglement measure applied to the spin models .",
    "the conclusions and a possible outlook will be presented in section  [ concl ] .",

    "it was proved that the factorization of the ground state is due to a fine tuning of the control parameters , _ within the magnetically ordered phase_. interestingly enough , the results obtained so far indicate that the factorization point is a precursor of the quantum phase transition .",

    "it was proved that the ground state is constituted by a sea of nearest neighbor valence bond states , separated from the first excitation by a finite gap with exponentially decaying correlation functions .",
    "the study of quantum correlations in many - body systems depends heavily on the impressive progress that has been achieved in the theory of entanglement quantification . the new ingredient that makes",
    "the many - body case very appealing is the rich variety of ways in which the system can be partitioned into subsystems .",
    "comprehensive overviews of entanglement measures can be found in  @xcite , it is however convenient to recall some of the entanglement measures that are routinely used to characterize many - body systems .",
    "important requirements for an entanglement measure are that it should be invariant under local unitary operations ; it should be continuous and , furthermore , additive when several identical copies are considered .",
    "most of the work done on entanglement in many - body systems deals with the bipartite case .",
    "a pure bipartite state is not entangled if and only if it can be written as a tensor product of pure states of the parts .",
    "it can be demonstrated that reduced density matrices can be decomposed by exploiting the schimdt decomposition : @xmath60 . since only product states lead to pure reduced density matrices , a measure for their mixedness points a way towards quantifying entanglement .",
    "one can thus use a suitable function of the @xmath61 given by the schmidt decomposition to quantify the entanglement . remarkably enough",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath62 can _ quantify _ the entanglement encoded in @xmath63 .",
    "we point out that an infinite class of entanglement measures can be constructed for pure states .",
    "infact by tracing out one of two qubits in the state , the corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath64 contains only a single independent parameter : its eigenvalue @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that each monotonic function @xmath66\\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] of this eigenvalue can be used as an entanglement measure .",
    "a relevant example is the ( one- ) tangle  @xcite @xmath67 = 4 { \\rm det } \\rho_a$ ] . by expressing @xmath64 in terms of spin expectation values",
    ", it follows that @xmath68=\\frac{1}{4}- ( { \\left\\langle s^x \\right\\rangle}^2+{\\left\\langle s^y \\right\\rangle}^2+{\\left\\langle s^z \\right\\rangle}^2 )   $ ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72 being the pauli matrices , for a pure state of two qubits it can be shown that @xmath73 is equivalent to the concurrence @xmath74",
    "@xcite for pure states of two qubits .",
    "the von neumann entropy can be expressed as a function of the ( one- ) tangle @xmath75=h[(1+\\sqrt{1-\\tau_1[\\rho_a]})/2 ] } $ ] where @xmath76 is the binary entropy .",
    "subsystems of a many - body ( pure ) state will generally be in a mixed state . in this case",
    "different ways of quantifying entanglement can be realized .",
    "three important representatives are the entanglement cost @xmath77 , the distillable entanglement @xmath78 ( both defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the entanglement of formation @xmath79  @xcite . in the following we concentrate on the entanglement of formation .",
    "the conceptual difficulty behind its calculation lies in the infinite number of possible decompositions of a density matrix .",
    "therefore , even knowing how to quantify bipartite entanglement in pure states , we can not simply apply this knowledge to mixed states in terms of an average over the mixtures of pure state entanglement .",
    "it turns out that the correct procedure is to take the minimum over all possible decompositions .",
    "this conclusion can be drawn from the requirement that entanglement must not increase on average by means of local operations including classical communication .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a state @xmath80 is therefore defined as @xmath81 where the minimum is taken over all realizations of the state @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath84 . for systems of two qubits , an analytic expression for @xmath79 does exist and it is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the the so called concurrence  @xcite defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the eigenvalues of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 indicates the complex conjugation ) .",
    "as the entanglement of formation is a monotonous function of the concurrence , also @xmath74 itself or its square @xmath91 - called also the 2-tangle - can be used as entanglement measures . the concurrence @xmath74 and the tangle @xmath73 both range from @xmath92 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath51 . by virtue of ( [ eq : concurrence ] )",
    ", the concurrence in a spin-1/2 chain can be computed in terms of the two - point spin correlation functions . as an example ( that is relevant for the present article ) we consider a case where the model has a parity symmetry , it is translational invariant and the hamiltonian is real . in this case",
    "the concurrence reads @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "a state with dominant fidelity of parallel and anti - parallel bell states is characterized by dominant @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "this was shown in  @xcite , where the concurrence was expressed in terms of the fully entangled fraction as defined in  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the tangle and the concurrence is due to the monogamy of entanglement which was expressed in terms of an inequality in  @xcite for the case of three qubits .",
    "this inequality has been proved to hold also for n - qubits system  @xcite . in the case of many - qubits",
    "it reads @xmath100 the so called residual tangle @xmath101 , is a measure for multipartite entanglement not stored in pairs of qubits only .",
    "another measure of entanglement we mention is the relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to any number of qubits in principle ( or any dimension of the local hilbert space ) .",
    "it is formally defined as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 $ ] is the quantum relative entropy .",
    "this relative entropy of entanglement quantifies the entanglement in @xmath104 by its distance from the set @xmath105 of separable states .",
    "the main difficulty in computing this measure is to find the disentangled state closest to @xmath106 .",
    "this is in general a non trivial task , even for two qubits . in the presence of certain symmetries - which is the case for e.g. eigenstates of certain models -",
    "an analytical access is possible . in these cases ,",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement becomes a very useful tool .",
    "the relative entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy in the case of pure bi - partite states ; this also means that its , so called , _",
    "convex roof extension _",
    "@xcite coincides with the entanglement of formation , and is readily deduced from the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that not just the quantification of many - party entanglement is a difficult task ; it is an open problem to tell in general , whether a state of @xmath107 parties is separable or not .",
    "it is therefore of great value to have a tool that is able to merely certify if a certain state is entangled .",
    "an entanglement witness @xmath108 is a operator that is able to detect entanglement in a state .",
    "the basic idea is that the expectation value of the witness @xmath108 for the state @xmath106 under consideration exceeds certain bounds only when @xmath106 is entangled .",
    "an expectation value of @xmath108 within this bound however does not guarantee that the state is separable . nonetheless , this is a very appealing method also from an experimental point of view , since it is sometimes possible to relate the presence of the entanglement to the measurement of few observables .",
    "simple geometric ideas help to explain the witness operator @xmath108 at work .",
    "let @xmath109 be the set of all density matrices and let @xmath110 and @xmath111 be the subsets of entangled and separable states , respectively .",
    "the convexity of @xmath111 is a key property for witnessing entanglement the entanglement witness is then an operator defining a hyper - plane which separates a given entangled state from the set of separable states .",
    "the main scope of this geometric approach is then to optimize the witness operator  @xcite or to replace the hyper - plane by a curved manifold , tangent to the set of separable states  @xcite .",
    "we have the freedom to choose @xmath108 such that @xmath112 for all disentangled states @xmath113 .",
    "then , @xmath114 implies that @xmath106 is entangled .",
    "entanglement witnesses are a special case of a more general concept , namely that of positive maps . these are injective superoperators on the subset of positive operators .",
    "when we now think of super - operators acting non - trivially only on part of the system ( on operators that act non trivially only on a sub - hilbert space ) , then we may ask the question whether a positive map on the subspace is also positive when acting on the whole space .",
    "maps that remain positive also on the extended space are called completely positive maps .",
    "positive but not completely positive maps are important for entanglement theory .",
    "indeed it can be shown  @xcite that state @xmath115 is entangled if and only if a positive map @xmath116 exists ( not completely positive ) such that @xmath117 .",
    "for a two dimensional local hilbert space the situation simplifies and in a system of two qubits the lack of complete positivity in a positive map is due to a partial transposition .",
    "this partial transposition clearly leads to a positive operator if the state is a tensor product of the parts .",
    "in fact , also the opposite is true : a state of two qubits @xmath115 is separable if and only if @xmath118 that is , its partial transposition is positive .",
    "this is very simple to test and it is known as the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite .",
    "the properties of entangled states under partial transposition lead to a measure of entanglement known as the _",
    "negativity_. the negativity @xmath119 of a bipartite state is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath120 .",
    "the _ logarithmic negativity _ is then defined as @xmath121 for bipartite states of two qubits , @xmath120 has at most one negative eigenvalue  @xcite . for general multipartite and higher local dimension",
    "this is only a sufficient condition for the presence of entanglement .",
    "there exist entangled states with a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) known as bound entangled states  @xcite .",
    "the existence of bound entangled states ultimately limits the possibility to exploit the violation of bell inequalities as a measure of entanglement .",
    "let us briefly introduce the concept of bound entanglement .",
    "such kind of entanglement can be recognized in terms of the so called distillation protocol , a non trivial procedure to optimize the extraction of bell states from a mixture of entangled states  @xcite .",
    "the natural question , then is : can any entangled state be actually distilled ?",
    "the answer is yes for bipartite and qubit states  @xcite . for multipartite entangled states and higher dimensional local hilbert spaces",
    "a much more complex scenario emerges . in these cases examples of entangled states",
    "have been provided that can not be distilled to maximally entangled states between the parties of the system , not even with an asymptotically infinite supply of copies of the state .",
    "such a demoted form of entanglement was termed as bound entanglement .",
    "ppt entangled states were found first in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of bipartite ( with higher dimensional local hilbert spaces ) npt bound entanglement has not excluded yet .",
    "this question has important implication on the additivity property of the distillable entanglement : if affirmative , entangled states could be generated from a mixture of non - distillable states . besides its speculative interest , it was demonstrated that bound entanglement can be activated in several quantum information and teleportation tasks to restore the singlet fidelity of a given state ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "multipartite bound entangled states exist that are not fully separable but contain entanglement between each of their parties that can not be distilled .",
    "given that violation of ppt is necessary for distillation , a feature of multipartite bound entanglement is related to the incomplete separability of the state ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a tripartite system a - b - c , for example , is separable with respect to the partition a|bc and b|ac and non - separable with respect to c|ab .",
    "the incomplete separability is a sufficient condition for a state to have bound entanglement since the three qubits are entangled and no maximally entangled state can be created between any of the parties by locc .",
    "for example , no entanglement can be distilled between c and a because no entanglement can be created with respect to the partition a|bc by locc . in the nest section the feature of incomplete separability",
    "will be exploited to detect multipartite bound entanglement in spin systems .",
    "the nature of correlations in bound entangled states is peculiar having both quantum and classical features .",
    "therefore , if it is true that all entangled states violates bell inequality , the vice versa has not proven ( see also @xcite and gisin @xcite ) .",
    "bipartite bound entangled states seem not violating bell inequalities  @xcite ( but some examples of multipartite bound entangled state violating bell - type inequalities were found  @xcite ) . for both the bipartite and multipartite entangled states",
    "there is a strong believe that necessary and sufficient condition for local realism is that the state satisfies the peres criterium  @xcite .    as already mentioned , a classification of multipartite entanglement is still missing .",
    "nevertheless there are several quantities serving as indicators for multipartite entanglement when the whole system is in a pure state .",
    "the entropy of entanglement is an example for such a quantity and several works use multipartite measures constructed from and related to it ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these measures give indication on a global correlation without discerning among the different entanglement classes encoded in the state of the system .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement quantifies the entanglement of a pure state through the minimal distance of the state from the set of pure product states  @xcite @xmath122 where the maximum is on all product states @xmath123 .",
    "it is zero for separable states and rises up to unity for e.g. the maximally entangled n - particle ghz states .",
    "the difficult task in its evaluation is the maximization over all possible separable states and of course the convex roof extension to mixed states . despite these complications ,",
    "a clever use of the symmetries of the problem renders this task accessible by substantially reducing the number of parameters over which the maximization has to be performed .",
    "another example for the collective measures of multipartite are the measures introduced by meyer and wallach  @xcite and by barnum _",
    "@xcite . in the case of qubit system",

    "global entanglement is very sensitive to the existence of qpts . as a paradigmatic example the authors analyzed the phase diagram in the anisotropy - magnetic field plane . by extending an earlier approach developed in  @xcite , de oliveira _ et al .",
    "_ also showed how the non - analytic behavior of @xmath228 is related to that of the ground state energy .",
    "note that from eq.([e2 ] ) it is possible to define an entanglement length proportional to the correlation length @xmath161 .",
    "this differs considerably from that one defined by the localizable entanglement ( see eq.([elenght ] ) ) ; the latter is always bounded from below by the correlation length and can even be divergent where @xmath161 is finite .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite the analysis of the average purity might not be sufficient and the analysis of the distribution of the purity for different partitions could give additional information .",
    "rather than measuring multipartite entanglement in terms of a single number , one characterizes it by using a whole function .",
    "one studies the distribution function of the purity ( or other measures of entanglement ) over all bipartitions of the system .",
    "if the distribution is sufficiently regular , its average and variance will constitute characteristic features of the global entanglement : the average will determine the `` amount '' of global entanglement in the system , while the variance will measure how such entanglement is distributed .",
    "a smaller variance will correspond to a larger insensitivity to the choice of the bipartition and , therefore , will be characteristic for different types of multipartite entanglement .    in @xcite multipartite entanglement is studied with the aim to shed light on how entanglement is shared in a many - body system . for a quantum @xmath15 model the simplest multiparticle entanglement of a subsystem made of three arbitrary spins of the chain is considered ; then bipartite entanglement between a spin and the other two with respect to all possible bipartitions .",
    "it is found that the block of two spins may be entangled with the external spin , despite the latter is not entangled directly with any of the two spins separately ( see fig .",
    "[ negt=0 ] ) .",
    "hence the range of such spin / block entanglement may extend further than the spin - spin entanglement range .",
    "it is plausible that increasing the size of the subsystem considered will increase the range of the multipartite entanglement .",
    "for instance , the range of spin / block entanglement will increase if we consider a larger block .",
    "hence , a single spin can be entangled with more distant partners , if one allows to cluster them into a large enough block .",
    "it would be intriguing to study how spin / block entanglement and , in general , block / block entanglement between subsystems , scale increasing the size of blocks . especially exploring the connection with quantum criticality .",
    "we remark that such analysis would be different with respect to the well known block entropy setting , since in that case one is interested in the block / rest - of - the - system entanglement .",
