    "we are interested in the solutions @xmath6 of the following functional equation @xmath7    this functional equation was implicitly considered in 1929 by chisini  @xcite , who investigated the concept of mean as an _ average _ or a _ numerical equalizer_. more precisely , chisini defined a mean of @xmath0 numbers @xmath8 with respect to a function @xmath5 as a number @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for instance , when @xmath110,\\infty\\right[$ ] and @xmath3 is the sum , the product , the sum of squares , the sum of inverses , or the sum of exponentials , the solution @xmath9 of the equation above is unique and consists of the arithmetic mean , the geometric mean , the quadratic mean , the harmonic mean , and the exponential mean , respectively .    by considering the _ diagonal section _ of @xmath3 , i.e. , the one - variable function @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : funceqfg ] ) as @xmath14 if , as in the examples above , we assume that @xmath3 is nondecreasing ( in each variable ) and that @xmath15 is a bijection from @xmath4 onto the range of @xmath3 , then chisini s equation ( [ eq : funceqfg2 ] ) clearly has a unique solution @xmath16 which is nondecreasing and idempotent ( i.e. , such that @xmath17 ) .",
    "such a solution is then called a _",
    "chisini mean _ or a _ level surface mean _ ( see bullen  ( * ? ? ? * vi.4.1 ) ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider chisini s functional equation ( [ eq : funceqfg2 ] ) in its full generality , i.e. , without any assumption on @xmath3 .",
    "we first provide necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath3 for the existence of solutions and we show how the possible solutions can be constructed ( section 2 ) .",
    "we also investigate solutions of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a quasi - inverse of @xmath15 ( section 3 ) .",
    "we then elaborate on the case when @xmath3 is nondecreasing and we show that if a solution exists then at least one nondecreasing and idempotent solution always exists .",
    "we construct such a solution by means of a metric interpolation ( inspired from urysohn s lemma and shepard s interpolation method ) and we discuss some of its properties ( section 4 ) .",
    "we also show that this solution obtained by interpolation is continuous whenever a continuous solution exists and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of continuous solutions ( section 5 ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , continuity of @xmath3 is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure the existence of continuous solutions .",
    "finally , we discuss a few applications of the theory developed here to certain classes of functions ( section 6 ) .",
    "in particular , we revisit the concept of chisini mean and we extend it to the case when @xmath15 is nondecreasing but not strictly increasing .",
    "the terminology used throughout this paper is the following .",
    "for any integer @xmath20 , we set @xmath21:=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] .",

    "we immediately see that , for any @xmath39 , the possible values of @xmath40 are exactly those reals @xmath41 for which the @xmath0-tuple @xmath42 belongs to the level set of @xmath3 through @xmath43 . in other terms , we must have @xmath44 thus a necessary condition for equation ( [ eq : funceqfg2 ] ) to have at least one solution is @xmath45 this fact also follows from the following sequence of inclusions : @xmath46 .    assuming the axiom of choice ( ac ) , we immediately see that condition ( [ eq : ranfrandf ] ) is also sufficient for equation ( [ eq : funceqfg2 ] ) to have at least one solution . indeed , by assuming both ac and ( [ eq : ranfrandf ] )",

    "we first observe that @xmath53 is a disjoint union of the level sets of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath54 thus , constructing a solution @xmath1 on @xmath53 reduces to constructing it on each level set @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
