    "in a recent paper , the author presented a particular solvable model of coulomb system inspired from the problem of the sedimentation equilibrium of charged colloidal suspensions .",
    "although the model is much simpler than real colloidal suspensions , it features several properties observed in numerical results for more realistic models and shows some new interesting results .",
    "this communication is a complement to ref .",
    "@xcite in which only the density profiles where computed . here we concentrate on thermodynamic quantities such as the grand potential . in section  [ model ]",
    "we briefly describe the model , in section  [ grandpotential ] we compute the grand potential of the system , and in the last section we present a special sum rule for this model .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional two - component plasma composed of two species of particles with charges @xmath0 and masses @xmath1 . we choose a system of cartesian coordinates @xmath2 in which the gravitational field is @xmath3 .",
    "the particles are in a container of height @xmath4 and infinite width .",
    "let us define the inverse gravitational lengths of the particles @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the inverse temperature . in the grand canonical ensemble",
    "we define position - dependent rescaled fugacities @xmath9 to account for the interaction of the particles with the external gravitational field .",
    "the screening length ( at zero altitude ) is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the two - component plasma is equivalent to a free dirac field when @xmath11 .",
    "the grand partition function can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 \\dslash^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 the pauli matrices and @xmath17 . to compute @xmath18",
    ", one must solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "then the grand potential is given by @xmath23    when an external field is acting differently over the positive and negative particles , as in the present case , it is useful to write the fugacities as @xmath24 $ ] where @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26",

    "this method is general and can be applied to others models of two - component plasma in an external field .",
    "in the present case , we look for solutions of  ( [ kdecouples ] ) of the form @xmath34 . from  ( [ kdecouples ] )",
    "we find the equation for @xmath35 @xmath36 h(y)+k_0 h'(y)+h''(y ) = 0\\,,\\ ] ] which is very similar to the equation  ( 3.2 ) of ref .",

    "the boundary conditions become @xmath42 and @xmath43 if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 .",
    "these conditions give a system of two linear homogeneous equations for the constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "writing that the discriminant of this system must be zero , in order to have non - trivial solutions , gives the equation that determines @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the sign of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath44 , @xmath21 is a solution of @xmath50 and if @xmath47 , @xmath21 is given by @xmath51 these equations have an infinite number of solutions . for each @xmath52 , we may index the different values of @xmath21 by an integer @xmath53 : @xmath54 . then , the grand potential by unit length in the @xmath55-direction is @xmath56 the sum over @xmath53 can be done explicitly , for example in the case where @xmath47 , by noting that the zeros of the entire function @xmath57 \\lefteqn { i_\\nu(m_0e^{-k_0 h}z / k_0 ) k_{\\nu-1}(m_0 z / k_0 ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & + i_{\\nu-1}(m_0 z / k_0 ) k_\\nu(m_0e^{-k_0 h}z / k_0 ) %                            [ \\big]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are @xmath58 and that @xmath59 , so @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath61 the same can be done in the case @xmath47 .",
    "then , the grand potential can be expressed as three integrals for @xmath52 in the domains @xmath62-\\infty,0\\right]$ ] , @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 . after a change of variable in the integrals",

    "equation  ( [ eq : omega2murs ] ) becomes @xmath67\\,d\\nu \\,.\\ ] ]    the two - component plasma at @xmath11 has logarithmic divergences due to the collapse of pairs of particles of opposite sign .",
    "this can be avoided by introducing hard core particles of radius @xmath68 .",
    "the integrals in  ( [ eq : omega2murs ] ) and  ( [ eq : omega1mur ] ) are divergent and must be cutoff , the upper limit of integration becomes @xmath69 .",
    "we can have an asymptotic expression for the grand potential in the usual physical case where @xmath70 , using the debye expansion of the bessel functions .",
    "the calculations are very similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite for a different problem .",
    "one finds @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the pressure of a two - component plasma without an external field .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this is the same grand potential of a system without gravity , but confined in a container of height @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we know that most of the particles are in fact in the region @xmath74 since for intermediate altitudes ( the neutral zone ) the density profiles decay as @xmath75 .",
    "we can write a sum rule for this system by computing in two different ways the force exerted on the bottom of the container .",
    "this force is the weight of the column of fluid over the base of the container . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also given by the pressure at zero altitude which can be computed by means of the contact theorem : it is the density at zero altitude times @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the sum rule @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the individual densities of the positive and negative particles respectly .",
    "this sum rule can be written in a simpler way ; because the system is neutral , both integrals in  ( [ sum - rule - long ] ) are equal to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the total number of particles .",
    "then , the sum rule becomes @xmath81    we expect this to be true at any temperature .",
    "we can test the sum rule in the present case when @xmath11 .",
    "the total number of particles can be computed from the grand potential : @xmath82 from equation  ( [ eq : omega1mur ] ) one finds @xmath83 on the other hand , from equation  ( 3.10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite we can compute the densities at zero altitude : @xmath84 the sum rule  ( [ sum - rule ] ) is verified .",
