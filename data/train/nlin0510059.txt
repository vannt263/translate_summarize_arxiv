    "a quarter of a millenium has elapsed since euler published for the first time what is now known as the euler equations of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "there has not been much celebration but this may just reflect our embarrassment at not having made enough progress . actually , leonhard euler warned us . at the end of his 1755 paper",
    "he wrote : `` however all that the theory of fluids holds , is contained in the two equations above , so that in the pursuit of the research we are not lacking the principles of mechanics , but solely the analysis , which is not yet cultivated enough for this design : hence we see clearly , which discoveries are left for us to make in this science , before we can attain a more perfect theory of the motion of fluids . ''",
    "( a paper in latin _ principia motus fluidorum _ , published a few years after the paper in french , contains the basic equations and was already presented under a different title to the berlin academy in 1752 . )    euler considered both the compressible and incompressible cases .",
    "here we are concerned only with the latter which is particularly difficult in view of the global nature of the incompressibility constraint .",
    "one of the most important open questions concerning the `` analysis '' of the euler equations is the well - posedness : does initially smooth 3d flow , which is known to remain smooth for short times , eventually `` blow up '' , that is become singular in a finite time ( see , e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) ? in two dimensions",
    "it has been known since the thirties that flow in a bounded domain , initially sufficiently smooth , never blows up @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that if such a 2d flow is initially analytic it will stay so forever @xcite . however , in the course of time , such flow can develop very fine scales and there is a large discrepancy between the analytic estimation of how the smallest scale decreases in time ( a double exponential ) and what is found in numerical simulations ( a simple exponential ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the likely cause of the discrepancy is _ depletion _ , the phenomenon by which high - reynolds number or inviscid incompressible flow tends to organize itself into structures having vastly reduced nonlinearities ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "depletion , which is still very poorly understood , may hold the key for understanding why 3d high - reynolds number flow seems never to blow up , at least in simulations . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the two - dimensional case .",
    "there are well - known 2d examples of depletion , such as flows which depend only on one cartesian coordinate or on the radial polar coordinate .",
    "such flows are however steady and thus globally depleted , with no dynamics . in this paper",
    "we shall be interested in 2d flow with an initial stream function which is a real trigonometric polynomial in the space variables , of the sort already considered in refs .",
    "these are the 2d counterparts of well - known 3d flows such as taylor  green and kida ",
    "pelz @xcite which have been used for ( so far inconclusive ) investigation of finite - time blow up .",
    "our 2d flows have generally non - trivial dynamics and display locally very strong depletion .",
    "trigonometric polynomials are instances of entire functions , that is , functions which are analytic in the whole complex domain .",
    "the only singularities of such functions are at complex infinity .",
    "the solution of the euler equations at times @xmath11 sufficiently small can then be extended analytically into the complex domain @xcite .",
    "there is strong numerical evidence in 2d and also in 3d that such flow does not stay entire and develops singularities at certain complex locations for any @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "complex singularities are usually detected through the fourier transforms of the solution : roughly , there is an exponential tail related to the distance of the nearest singularity from the real domain , accompanied by an algebraic prefactor related to the nature ( also called type or structure).of the singularities .",
    "little is known about the nature of complex singularities of the euler equations . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it is shown numerically for the 2d case with the initial stream function @xmath12 that the complex singularities lie on a smooth manifold and that the vorticity becomes infinite when approaching the singular manifold ; there is however considerable uncertainty as to the scaling law of this divergence . in ref",
    "@xcite the motion of preexisting complex - space singularities is studied analytically but their nature is kept quite arbitrary . in ref .",
    "@xcite traveling - wave solutions with a pure imaginary velocity are studied for 3d axisymmetrical flow with swirl ; using an ultra - high precision numerical method , the singularities in the complexified axial variable are mapped out as a function of the ( real ) radial variable and found to lie on a smooth curve ; the nature of the singularities is obtained using a `` sliding fit '' method . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the vortex sheet problem with an initially analytic interface , the nature of complex singularities of the interface is obtained using an ultra - high precision method and a `` pointwise fit '' .",
    "the sliding fit and the pointwise fit are very closely related to the method we use in section  [ ss : captalpref ] and we shall come back to this matter . since the work of krasny @xcite , it appears that ultra - high precision is a prerequisite for obtaining numerical information on the nature of singularities , particularly when they are in the complex domain .    from a _ theoretical _ point of view , for many nonlinear equations of mathematical physics",
    "a very successful tool in studying the nature of singularities has been dominant balance and its refined versions such as painlev analysis @xcite .",
    "dominant balance analysis typically gives _ universal _ singularities , that is singularities whose positions may depend on the initial conditions but their nature does not .",
    "the simplest instance is the 1d viscous burgers equation whose complex - space singularities are simple poles , obtainable by balancing the nonlinear term against the viscous one . for the @xmath13-dimensional incompressible euler equations , attempts to use dominant balance fail",
    "because of the particular structure of the nonlinearity : if we assume that the solution becomes singular on a complex manifold of dimension @xmath14 , the nonlinearity vanishes to leading order .",
    "this is just a consequence of the simplest form of depletion , the vanishing of nonlinearity for solutions which depend on a single spatial coordinate .",
    "the nature of singularities can not be obtained by a dominant balance argument ; actually , as we shall see , complex singularities of the 2d euler equation display a very unusual _",
    "non - universality_.    in this paper we will mainly discuss the _ short - time asymptotic rgime _ presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and extensively used in ref .",
    "@xcite which gives us the most accurate information on the nature of complex singularities .",
    "after briefly introducing it in section  [ s : pshydr ] we will show that this rgime can be reformulated as a `` pseudo - hydrodynamic '' euler problem , in which all the action including the singularities takes place in a plane extending in the pure imaginary directions , but our usual hydrodynamic intuition is still applicable .",
    "the short - time asymptotics allows us to obtain recurrence relations for spatial fourier components involving only wavectors @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , a feature which is also present in the moore approximation for vortex sheets @xcite and its generalization to smooth flow @xcite ; as a consequence fourier components can be calculated in ultra - high precision without any truncation error . in section  [ s : fourier ]",
    "we present the numerical evidence for simple scaling laws associated to complex singularities and determine the nature of the singularities with high precision . analyzing short - time asymptotics for different initial conditions ,",
    "we find that the singularities are non - universal . in section  [ s : geometry ]",
    "we describe the global and local geometry of the pseudo - hydrodynamic flow , including depletion of nonlinearity which is especially strong near the singularities .",
    "sections  [ s : fourier ] and [ s : geometry ] both involve a mixture of numerical results and of theoretical arguments , some heuristic , some more rigorous .",
    "we must stress that at the moment we do understand various features of the solution , in particular why the scaling exponent for singularities does not depend on the direction , but we failed so far to reproduce by theory the non - universal scaling exponents observed for the singularities . nevertheless by moving to yet another level of toy - modeling ( the equivalent for our problem of considering the vorticity as a passive scalar in a prescribed velocity field ) , we can determine the nature of the corresponding complex singularities using dynamical systems tools ( section  [ s : linearized ] ) .",
    "the nature of these `` advection '' singularities is however universal and therefore does not reproduce an essential feature of the nonlinear euler flow .",
    "finally , conclusions , open problems and a tentative road map for future research on blow up are presented in section  [ s : conclusion ] . to make the present paper reasonably self - contained we shall occasionally re - derive results already found in ref .",
    "@xcite and mbf .",
    "we are interested in the short - time asymptotics for the 2d euler equation , written in terms of the stream function @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath21 is a real @xmath22-periodic trigonometric polynomial of the form @xmath23 , where the sum has only a finite number of terms .",
    "here @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are signed integers .",
    "the short - time asymptotics is simplest when the initial condition has only two orthogonal fourier modes , as in refs .",
    "@xcite where the assumed initial condition is @xmath27 in what follows we shall call this initial condition standard orthogonal case ( soc ) . one of our present goals is to investigate to what extent complex singularities are or are not universal , we are thus naturally led to considering more general cases , having , e.g. , more than two modes in the initial conditions . in appendix  [ a : multimode ] it will be shown that the short - time asymptotic rgime for the multimode case can be reduced to a set of two - mode initial conditions .",
    "we may thus without loss of generality limit ourselves to two - mode initial conditions of the form @xmath28 here c.c .",
    "stands for `` complex conjugate '' , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two vectors with signed integer components . furthermore , we assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not parallel and do not have the same modulus since otherwise the two - mode initial condition is a time - independent solution of the euler equation . by performing",
    "if needed a suitable translation , we can then assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are positive .",
    "finally , since our goal here is primarily to demonstrate non - universality of the nature of the singularities with respect to the initial conditions , we shall not strive for the greatest generality and limit ourselves to _ basic modes _ with non - negative components such that @xmath35 .",
    ".   has a solution in the form of a taylor series in the time variable @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the initial condition and the @xmath38 s for @xmath39 are easily shown to satisfy the recursion relations : @xmath40 for the two - mode initial condition all the @xmath38 are trigonometric polynomials that can be continued analytically to complex locations @xmath41 . since the initial condition has its singularities at infinity , we expect , by continuity , that at short times the singularities will have large imaginary parts @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "let us now suppose that @xmath44 and @xmath45 in such a way that their ratio @xmath46 stays finite but arbitrary . obviously , the four vectors @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 divide the @xmath51-space into four angular sectors so that , e.g.  in the first angular sector @xmath52 .",
    "then , for @xmath53 such that @xmath54 lies in the first angular sector , to leading order any additional factor @xmath55 in the expansion is accompanied by either a factor @xmath56 or a factor @xmath57 , thus giving amplitude factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . when @xmath60 and @xmath61 these factors remain finite , provided @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "are shifted by @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the short - time asymptotics is obtained by the _ similarity ansatz _",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are determined by @xmath68 substitution in gives the _ similarity equation _",
    "@xmath69 where the tilde means that the partial derivatives are taken with respect to the new variables .",
    "the initial condition becomes an asymptotic boundary condition @xmath70 in the second and third terms on the l.h.s .",
    "can be viewed as stemming from the advection by a pure imaginary constant `` drift velocity '' .",
    "this is because we are following the singularities coming `` down '' from complex infinity .",
    "it is important to observe that is an exact consequence of the euler equation .",
    "the only place where an approximation is made is in the boundary condition where harmonics containing e.g.  @xmath71 and @xmath72 are discarded because such terms are exponentially subdominant at short times .    in what follows we shall generally limit ourselves to soc , giving occasionally an indication of what is valid for more general two - mode cases . the general case can easily be handled but we wish to avoid burdening the reader with unnecessarily complicated statements and equations .    the function @xmath73 , which is @xmath22-periodic in @xmath74 and @xmath75-periodic in @xmath76 , is analytic in the product of the half - spaces @xmath77 and @xmath78 and thus its spatial fourier series has only harmonics of the form @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath17 .",
    "its fourier series is here written as and @xmath26 were defined with the opposite sign . ]",
    "@xmath81 the reason for the presence of the factor @xmath82 will become clear shortly .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath83 can be calculated recursively from the relation given in mbf which follows from @xmath84 here , @xmath85 . because there are no fourier harmonics with negative @xmath25 or @xmath26 , the convolutions in only involve positive arguments .",
    "this feature , which allows truncation - free determination of fourier coefficients , is also present in the moore approximation for the vortex sheet problem and in its generalization to axisymmetrical flow @xcite .",
    "the initialization of the recursion relations requires the knowledge of the coefficients along the `` edges '' , that is the half - lines @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the present case @xmath88 and @xmath89 while all the other edge harmonics are zero . and",
    "@xmath90 , the main change with respect to soc is the replacement in of the denominator @xmath91 by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined in . ]",
    "it has been shown in mbf that , with the choice made above in , the coefficient @xmath95 is the only one that is negative .",
    "all the other ones are non - negative .",
    "this result has so far only been established by ( very solid ) numerical computations and holds for all the two - mode initial conditions studied .",
    "as we shall see , this has important consequences for the geometry of singularities .",
    "we shall now show that can be reformulated as the steady solution of a _ pseudo - hydrodynamic _ problem in a suitable imaginary plane . since we are working with analytic functions",
    ", we can replace the complex partial derivatives",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , holding the @xmath100-coordinates fixed . in terms of such @xmath101-derivatives becomes an equation with real coefficients .",
    "if we furthermore choose @xmath102 and @xmath103 such that the boundary condition becomes real then the solution `` above such points '' @xmath104 is also real .",
    "this happens for @xmath105 and for @xmath106 .",
    "the positivity of all but one of the fourier coefficients defined in with the factor @xmath82 , amounts to stating that , after moving the origin to @xmath107 , all but one of the usual fourier coefficients of @xmath104 are positive . as we shall see in section  [ s : geometry ] , this gives us the possibility of analyzing the ( short - time ) complex singularities by focusing solely on the @xmath101-plane above @xmath107 .",
    "this point turns out also to be a center of symmetry for the euler flow with the initial condition , but it is not clear whether this matters . , but an elliptic structure near @xmath108 which is also a center of symmetry . ] henceforth we shall consider the @xmath101-plane above @xmath107 .",
    "we define a pseudo - stream function in terms of the @xmath101-coordinates ( from now on we drop the tilde on the @xmath101 variables for notational simplicity ) @xmath109 where the two linear terms on the r.h.s .",
    "have been introduced to avoid having an additional advection term .",
    "note that because of these terms , @xmath110 is not the continuation to complex coordinates of a function periodic in @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "it is now elementary to check that - are equivalent to taking the steady - state ( @xmath111-independent ) solution of the pseudo - hydrodynamic equation @xmath112 with the asymptotic boundary condition ( for @xmath113 ) @xmath114 here , in order to bring out familiar hydrodynamic notation , we have introduced a pseudo - time variable @xmath111 . and thus @xmath110 to also depend on @xmath55 and set @xmath115",

    "the @xmath111-derivative term has been put within square brackets since we are only interested in the steady - state solution .",
    "note that the pseudo - hydrodynamic formulation in the @xmath101-plane is that of a quasi - two - dimensional flow in a 3d container with bottom friction producing a rayleigh drag . in this formulation @xmath123 as we approach the initial instant .",
    "an alternative interpretation is to define @xmath111 as @xmath124 , to avoid reversing the course of time , and then to change the signs of @xmath125 and of @xmath126 and replace the rayleigh drag by an instability .    in the pseudo - hydrodynamic formulation it is now obvious that the problem is invariant under an arbitrary translation @xmath127 in @xmath101-space . by , such a translation amounts to a factor @xmath128 on the fourier coefficients @xmath129",
    "it follows , as noted in mbf , that the set of initial conditions @xmath130 is equivalent to soc as long as @xmath131 is within the analyticity domain .",
    "similarly , a translation in @xmath132-space with integer components @xmath133 is equivalent to multiplying @xmath134 by the exponential factor @xmath135 in @xmath101-space .",
    "the exponential being an entire function , this changes neither the positions nor the nature of the singularities at finite distance .",
    "we shall show in this section that the solution of the euler equation in the short - time asymptotic rgime defined in the previous section , has remarkably clean scaling properties in fourier space . by this",
    "we mean that the wavenumber dependence of the fourier coefficients is represented as a decreasing exponential multiplied by an algebraic prefactor whose exponent can be measured very accurately .",
    "such a functional form is not surprising .",
    "in fact the exponential is the signature of the location of a singularity while the prefactor encodes the nature of the singularity . for one - dimensional analytical functions with isolated singularities in the complex space",
    "this is well known : a singularity at @xmath136 of the form @xmath137 has a signature in the modulus of the fourier transform at high wavenumbers @xmath132 of the form @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the the distance of @xmath136 to the real axis ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "such asymptotic results have been extended in the nineties to the fourier transforms of periodic analytical functions of several complex variables when the wavevector @xmath140 tends to infinity with a fixed rational slope @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are relative prime integers@xcite .",
    "when the fourier coefficients are obtained numerically , there is a maximum wavenumber @xmath144 .",
    "unless it is taken very large , there will be very few points on the line of slope @xmath145 as soon as @xmath143 is not a very small integer .",
    "but a large value of @xmath144 entails extremely small fourier coefficients because of the exponential decrease with the wavenumber .",
    "thus , as stressed in mbf , very high precision may be needed to avoid swamping by the rounding errors .",
    "truncation errors are not an issue in the short - time asymptotic rgime since the fourier coefficients can be calculated from with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "the data obtained for the soc initial condition in mbf had wavenumbers @xmath146 up to 1000 or 2000 , depending on the direction and were calculated with 35-digit accuracy .. ] most of the results presented here are based on the 35-digit calculation .",
    "additional calculations are also presented here with various initial conditions , with up to 100-digit precision and wavenumbers which can reach 4000 in particular directions .",

    "what is happening has a geometric interpretation which is more readily understood after reading the first page of section  [ s : geometry ] . in the short - time rgime",
    "the positivity of the fourier coefficients implies that the singular manifold is in the @xmath101-plane .",
    "note , however , that in this rgime we are ignoring interactions with fourier harmonics from quadrants other than the first one since they only contribute subdominant terms in the short - time expansion of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "when such terms are taken into account it is likely that singularities obtained at leading order will be mostly advected by a modified velocity field which carries the singularities slightly out of the @xmath101-plane without changing their nature , as happens in the work of tanveer and speziale @xcite .",
    "of course , positivity of the fourier coefficients will be lost but not necessarily their scaling properties . observe also that the @xmath101-plane being a plane of symmetry , this picture implies that there are several pieces of the singular manifold very close to the @xmath101-plane . in fourier space",

    "although the passive scalar model does not predict the exact and non - universal character of the vorticity blow up for the full nonlinear problem , the singular manifold is given quite accurately by the passive scalar model .",
    "in particular it is immediately checked that both have the same logarithmic branches ( at least to leading order ) .",
    "furthermore in the passive scalar model the stable / singular manifold goes exactly through the origin while in the full nonlinear problem it passes within a distance @xmath417 , as shown in mbf .",
    "it may be that such agreements are due to the presence of very strong depletion of nonlinearity in the full problem , thereby making a simple linear advection model quite relevant .",
    "actually , the passive scalar model can be systematically improved by enriching the prescribed velocity field through addition of higher - order modes . a simple way to do",

    "increasingly sharp u - turns of the streamlines near the lower logarithmic branch of the singular manifold give rise to the vorticity scaling .",
    "very strong depletion of nonlinearity near the singular manifold prevents application of dominant balance to determine the scaling exponent of singularities and is likely to be the reason for the very unusual non - universality of the singularities .",
    "finally it is shown that the scaling behavior of the prefactor persists in time significantly beyond the validity of the short - time asymptotics , at least as intermediate asymptotics . however , we do not know if the non - universality of the singularities found in the short - time rgime carries over to the full euler equation .",
    "the main theoretical shortcomings of this work are our inability so far to prove the positivity of fourier coefficients and to derive the prefactor exponent @xmath2 ( or the vorticity divergence exponent @xmath356 ) from the initial conditions ( we also failed to identify the nature of subleading corrections to ) .",
    "we have nevertheless gained some qualitative understanding with the passive scalar model of section  [ s : linearized ] that ignores the back reaction of the vorticity on the velocity but which sheds interesting light on the mechanism for producing singularities . in this toy model ,",
    "scaling is controlled by a stagnation point of the velocity field , whereas in the full nonlinear problem the stagnation point is rejected to infinity .",
    "we have described our findings in some detail , hoping that colleagues will be able to help us with the missing theory .    in principle the methods used for the 2d short - time euler problem can be extended to various other short - time problems .",
    "one instance is the short - time rgime for the 2d ideal incompressible mhd equations .",

    "<S> a detailed study of complex - space singularities of the two - dimensional incompressible euler equation is performed in the short - time asymptotic rgime when such singularities are very far from the real domain ; this allows an exact recursive determination of arbitrarily many spatial fourier coefficients . using high - precision arithmetic we find that the fourier coefficients of the stream function are given over more than two decades of wavenumbers by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor exponent @xmath2 , typically between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is determined with an accuracy better than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the initial condition but not on @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the vorticity diverges as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the distance to the ( complex ) singular manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this new type of non - universal singularity is permitted by the strong reduction of nonlinearity ( depletion ) which is associated to incompressibility . </S>",
    "<S> spectral calculations show that the scaling reported above persists well beyond the time of validity of the short - time asymptotics . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model in which the vorticity is treated as a passive scalar is shown analytically to have universal singularities with exponent @xmath10 .    </S>",
