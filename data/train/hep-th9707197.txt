    "our understanding of supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) has grown rapidly over the last four years @xcite .",
    "there are now solid examples of four dimensional gauge theories that confine by the dual meissner effect , exhibit chiral symmetry breaking and even theories that give rise to massless composites .",
    "one natural question to ask is how these phenomena relate to non - supersymmetric theories and in particular to qcd .",
    "some progress has been made in including perturbing soft susy breaking interactions whilst retaining the `` exactness '' of the supersymmetric results @xcite .",
    "we review some of those continuum results and their importance to lattice simulations of pure glue sqcd .",
    "finally we discuss non - supersymmetric `` brane '' configurations in string theory and their field theory interpretation , identifying the corresponding soft susy breaking operators .",

    "we begin from the n=1 @xmath1 sqcd theories with @xmath2 flavors described by the uv lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the standard chiral matter superfields and @xmath6 the gauge superfield .",
    "the coupling @xmath7 determines the kinetic normalization of the matter fields .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath8 defines a dynamical scale of sqcd : @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the one loop coefficient of the sqcd @xmath11-function . and",
    ", finally , @xmath12 is a supersymmetric mass term for the matter fields .",
    "we may raise these couplings to the status of spurion chiral superfields which are then frozen with scalar component vevs .",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking parameters may be introduced through the f - component of the spurion coupling fields .",
    "a gaugino mass may be generated from the gauge coupling @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14    @xmath15    scalar masses and interactions may be introduced through the mass spurion and kinetic normalization @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath16 gives    @xmath17    and allowing a component of @xmath18 @xmath19    it is particularly useful to write the soft breakings as the components of the spurion fields because the symmetries of the sqcd model are left unaltered even in the softly broken model .",
    "the sqcd theory without a mass term has the symmetries @xmath20 the mass term breaks the chiral symmetries to the vector symmetry .",
    "the classical @xmath21 symmetry on the matter fields is anomalous and , if there is a massless quark , may be used to rotate away the @xmath0 angle . in the massive theory the flavor symmetries",
    "may be used to rotate @xmath22 to diagonal form and the anomalous @xmath23 symmetry under which the @xmath4s have charge @xmath24 may be used to rotate @xmath0 on to the massless gaugino . including the spurion fields the non - anomalous @xmath23 symmetry charges are @xmath25 the anomalous symmetries",
    "may be restored to the status of symmetries of the model if we also allow the spurions to transform .",
    "the appropriate charges are @xmath26 the @xmath22 spurions also transform under the chiral flavor group .",
    "these symmetries and supersymmetry remain symmetries of the model no matter which components of the spurions are non - zero and hence they may be used to determine the low energy theory of the softly broken models ( there is an assumption that there is not a phase transition to a totally different set of variables as soon as supersymmetry is broken ) .",
    "the use of these symmetries is completely analgous to the use of chiral symmetry in qcd to find the mass dependence of the qcd chiral lagrangian .    for pure supersymmetric models",
    "the potential minima may be found from the superpotential alone which is holomorphic in the fields and spurions .",
    "the exact results for the far ir behaviour of the theories result from the very limited number of possible terms compatible with the symmetries .",
    "there is an immediate problem in the softly broken theories though which is that scalar masses may be generated from non - holomorphic kahler terms .",
    "for example    @xmath27    thus for example if one begins from an sqcd theory with a moduli space in the scalar vevs the minima of the potential in the softly broken model will depend on these unknown terms .",
    "in particular one does not know the sign of these mass terms ; a negative mass would indicate a higgs mechanism and a mass gap , a positive mass would leave the scalar s fermionic partner massless .    a solution to this problem @xcite is to begin with an sqcd theory in which the scalars have supersymmetric masses . for small soft breakings",
    "relative to that mass the unknown kahler terms may be neglected . as the simplest example consider sqcd with a mass term for the matter fields .",
    "the resulting theories have a mass gap on the scale @xmath12 and the induced meson @xmath28 vev is determined independently of @xmath2 by holomorphy @xmath29 the resulting supersymmetric theories have @xmath30 distinct vacua corresponding to the @xmath30th roots of unity , @xmath31 ( as predicted by the witten index ) .",
    "note that for the theories with magnetic duals putting masses in for all flavors breaks the dual gauge group completely .",
    "for simplicity henceforth we shall take @xmath22 to be proportional to the identity matrix ; in this basis @xmath32 is also proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "these massive theories may be softly broken in a controlled fashion .",
    "if the spurion generating the soft breaking enters the superpotential linearly then we may obtain desirable results when that spurion s f - component @xmath33 .",
    "any kahler term contributions to the scalar potential take the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 standing for generic fields or spurions . in the supersymmetric limit",
    "all f - components are zero and will grow as the vacuum expectation value of the soft breaking spurion .",
    "these kahler terms are therefore higher order in the soft breaking parameter than the linear term from the superpotential .",
    "the unknown corrections to the squark masses in the theory are subleading to the masses generated by the supersymmetric mass term and hence we may determine the potential minima at lowest order .    as an example we introduce a gaugino mass through the spurion @xmath13 . in the ir theory @xmath13",
    "enters through the strong interaction scale @xmath37 which occurs linearly in the superpotential of the theory .",
    "taking @xmath38 we may determine the vacuum structure .",

    "is given by ( [ slimit ] ) which also contains @xmath37 and hence has a non - zero f - component . including @xmath41 and performing the superspace integral we obtain up to a coefficient the following corrections to the potential that break the degeneracy between the @xmath30 sqcd vacua @xmath42\\\\ & = \\nonumber & \\left|m^{n_f / n_c } 8 \\pi m_\\lambda \\lambda^{(3n_c - n_f)\\over                  n_c}\\right| \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "there is also an additional contribution to the vacuum energy arising from the gaugino condensate . using the konishi anomaly @xcite",
    ", we see that it has the same form as ( [ gpot ] ) .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking contributions to the potential break the degeneracy between the @xmath30 supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the model has interesting phase structure as the bare @xmath0 angle is changed .",
    "there are phase transitions as @xmath44 is varied , occurring at @xmath47(odd)@xmath48 .",
    "this behavior can be compared with the @xmath0 angle dependence of the qcd chiral lagrangian @xcite for which there are @xmath2 distinct vacua which interchange through first order phase transitions at @xmath49(odd)@xmath48 .    unfortunately if we wish to keep control of the low energy solution we are forced to keep the soft breakings small and we can not decouple the superpartners to recover non - supersymmetric qcd .",
    "there is however one conclusion for qcd that we can tentatively draw from this analysis . in these models",
    "the form of the confined effective theory changes smoothly with the @xmath0 angle and there is no sign of a break down of confinement as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this lends some support to the assumption @xcite that the chiral lagrangian remains the correct discription of qcd in the ir even at non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "although the techniques for solving the supersymmetric and softly broken theories described above provide an extremely plausible picture of the low - energy dynamics of these models , one may feel a little discomfort at the absence of direct non - perturbative tests of the results .",
    "an obvious possibility is that these models could be simulated directly on the lattice .",
    "some initial work in these directions has already been performed in @xcite.unfortunately , as is well known , lattice regularization violates supersymmetry @xcite , and a special fine - tuning is required to recover the susy limit ( this is analogous to the case of chiral symmetry in lattice qcd ) .",
    "away from the susy point , the continuum limit of the lattice theory is described by a model with explicit susy violating interactions . in some cases",
    ", these violations may correspond only to soft breakings , although this is not guaranteed in general .",
    "pure glue sqcd is a simple theory with only one parameter , the gauge coupling .",
    "the only low - dimension ( renormalizable ) susy violation allowed by gauge invariance is a gaugino mass , which is a soft violation .",
    "therefore , the continuum limit of the lattice regularized version of sym is simply sym with a massive gaugino .",
    "the susy limit can be reached by fine - tuning the lattice parameter corresponding to a bare gaugino mass . in order to understand this limit as well as possible , we will study continuum sym with explicit gaugino mass @xcite , and derive some relations describing the approach to the susy limit .",
    "several non - trivial predictions can be made regarding the vacuum energy and of the behavior of the gaugino condensate .",
    "a less rigorously derived description of the lightest bound states of sym theory has also been proposed in the literature @xcite from which predictions for the masses of the gluino - gluino and glue - gluino bound states and their splittings away from the supersymmetric point may be obtained .",
    "the bare lagrangian of sym with @xmath1 gauge group is @xmath50 ~.\\ ] ] this model possesses a discrete global @xmath51 symmetry , a residual non - anomalous subgroup of the anomalous chiral @xmath52 .",
    "the theory is believed to generate a gaugino condensate and have a mass gap .    in supersymmetric notation",
    "the lagrangian ( [ sym ] ) can be written as @xmath53 where the gauge coupling is defined to be @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 is explicitly @xmath56-periodic in the @xmath0-angle .    to derive the low energy effective theory of sqcd",
    "we note that there are two anomalous symmetries of the theory , @xmath23 and scale invariance .",
    "in fact their anomalies are related since their currents belong to the same supermultiplet .",
    "these symmetries can be restored in an enlarged theory provided we allow the spurion couplings to transform : @xmath57 @xmath58    we may now determine the general form of the partition function ( assuming a mass gap ) as a function of @xmath13 subject to these symmetries .",
    "the only possible terms are @xmath59 = { \\rm } \\hspace{0.1 cm } { \\rm exp } ~ iv \\left [   { 9 \\over \\alpha }    \\lambda^\\dagger \\lambda|_d + ( \\beta \\lambda^3|_f + h.c . ) \\right]\\ ] ]    the numerical coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath11 remain undetermined from the above symmetry arguments .",
    "@xmath11 may be determined from the results for sqcd with massive quarks where for @xmath60 the full gauge symmetry may be higgsed and the coefficient of the superpotential term calculated by perturbative instanton methods .",
    "we find @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "these strong arguments lead to two predictions for the condensates of the sym theory .",
    "the source @xmath62 for the gaugino correlator @xmath63 occurs in the same position as the f - component of @xmath13 and is hence known .",
    "there are two independent correlators",
    "@xmath64    the ir theory has a gaugino condensate @xmath65 , with phase @xmath66 and hence there are @xmath30 degenerate vacua associated with the @xmath30th roots of unity .",
    "below , therefore , @xmath67 is an @xmath30 valued constant with phases @xmath68 where @xmath69 runs from @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "we may induce a bare gaugino mass through a non zero f - component of the bare gauge coupling @xmath72    in the ir theory @xmath13 enters through the spurion @xmath37 which occurs linearly in the superpotential of the theory .",
    "thus there will be a correction to the potential of the form : @xmath73 terms with superderivatives acting on the spurion field can also give rise to contributions to the potential but these are higher order in an expansion in @xmath74 .",
    "the shift in the potential energy of the @xmath30 degenerate vacua of the sym theory at linear order in @xmath75 is known and we may determine the vacuum structure @xmath76\\ ] ] for small soft breakings , @xmath77 , where the linear term dominates , the degeneracy between the sym vacua is broken favoring one vacuum dependent on the phase of the gaugino mass .",
    "the coefficient in the energy shift is a test of the exact superpotential in ( [ sz ] ) .",
    "we may also determine the leading shift in the gaugino condensate @xmath78 which depends on the unknown parameter @xmath43 .",
    "strictly speaking there are also divergent contributions to this quantity which are proportional to @xmath75 times the cut - off squared .",
    "reinserting the bare @xmath79 angle into the expression for the shift in vacuum energy we find @xmath80\\ ] ] as @xmath79 is changed first order phase transitions occur at @xmath81 where two of the @xmath30 sym vacua interchange as the minimum of the softly broken theory .",
    "an alternative description of the low energy behaviour of sym theory has been presented by veneziano and yankelowicz @xcite which attempts to describe the lightest bound states of the theory .",
    "the form of their effective action can be rigourously obtained from the discussion above . since",
    "the source @xmath62 for @xmath82 occurs in the same places as the coupling @xmath13 we also know the source dependence of @xmath83 .",
    "if we wish we may legendre transform @xmath84 $ ] to obtain the effective potential for the classical field @xmath85 we find @xmath86 & = & { 9 \\over \\alpha } \\left ( \\bar s s \\right)^{1/3}\\big|_d\\\\ & &   ~+~   n_c \\left ( s - s\\ln ( s/ \\lambda^3 ) \\right)\\big|_f+ \\ , \\mbox{h.c.}~ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so derived this effective action contains no more information than ( [ sz ] ) simply being a classical potential whose minimum determines the vev of @xmath87 and we find , by construction , eq([cond ] ) .",
    "a stronger interpretation can also though be given to the vy action .",
    "if we assert that the lightest bound states of the theory are those that interpolate in the perturbative regime to the field @xmath82 , and hence share the same symmetry properties , then those symmetries again reproduce the vy action for those lightest fields . to obtain the physical states one performs an appropriate rescaling of the @xmath87-field @xmath88 in the lagrangian ( [ vy ] ) to make the kinetic term canonical    @xmath89    in fact , as pointed out and corrected in @xcite ,",
    "this effective lagrangian is not complete since it does not possess the full @xmath90 symmetry of the quantum theory . to restore that symmetry the extra term @xmath91 where @xmath12 is an integer valued lagrange multiplier",
    "must be added .",
    "for the @xmath92 vacuum with vanishing phase this extra term vanishes and the vy model above is recovered .",
    "we shall concentrate on that vacuum .",
    "one must worry about possible mixing between @xmath93 and the next massive state with the same quantum numbers but it seems reasonable that this state may be significantly heavier and hence may be neglected .",
    "we shall move on and use the vy action as a description of the lightest states to make predictions about the masses of those states .",
    "a lattice simulation will hopefully test these predictions and shed light on whether the action is indeed the correct description .    the straightforward evaluation of bosonic ( @xmath94 ) and fermionic ( @xmath95 ) excitation masses around the minimum from eq([vylr ] )",
    "gives @xmath96    it is important to stress that these masses are not the physical masses of the bound states .",
    "rather , they are zero - momentum quantities , which are related to the physical ones by wave function factors @xmath97 .",
    "these wave function factors result from higher - derivative kahler terms in @xmath98 , and are unknown .",
    "a soft breaking gaugino mass may again be introduced through the f - component of the spurion @xmath37 .",
    "we can calculate the shifts in the masses of the bound states .",
    "the two scalar fields and the fermionic field are split in mass @xmath99    the physical masses are again related to these quantities by unknown wave function renormalizations @xmath83 which arise from kahler terms , @xmath100 fortunately , we know that in the susy limit the wavefunction factors are common within a given multiplet .",
    "this degeneracy holds even after the vev of the field is shifted by the soft breakings since a shift in the vev alone ( without susy breaking ) leaves the physical masses degenerate within a multiplet .",
    "we also know that the _ relative change _ in these kahler terms is @xmath101 , and hence can be ignored at leading order in the soft breakings .",
    "therefore , we may still obtain a prediction for the rate of change of the ratios of the physical masses , @xmath102   m_\\lambda \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] near the susy limit .",
    "the factor in brackets is common within a given multiplet .",
    "since the quantity @xmath103 is unknown , we can only predict the _ ratios _ of @xmath104 at the susy point or equivalently the ratios of @xmath105 .",
    "finally we note , as pointed out in @xcite , that the vy model apparently has an extra susy vacuum corresponding to @xmath106 . at this point",
    "@xmath107 is singular and so it is not clear how to interpret this vacuum .",
    "shifman and kovner have proposed that the vacuum is real and represents some conformal , @xmath51 preserving point of the theory .",
    "it would be interesting to look for this vacuum in lattice simulations but unfortunately as can be seen from ( 22 ) there is no value of soft breaking mass for which such a vacuum would be the global minimum .",
    "this will make it difficult to observe in lattice simulations .",
    "the most recent progress in understanding sqcd has come from string theory . in type iia",
    "string theory d - brane constructions can be made that realize 4d field theories in the world volume of one of the d - branes @xcite .",
    "the standard construction is to suspend @xmath30 d4-branes between two ns5-branes to generate an @xmath1 gauge symmetry in the d4-branes world volume .",
    "@xmath2 d6-branes intersecting the d4-branes contribute vector matter multiplets transforming under the gauge symmetry and a gauged flavor symmetry @xmath108 .",
    "for example an n=2 configuration may be described as follows @xcite .",
    "this configuration describes an @xmath1 gauge theory with a real adjoint scalar field corresponding to the freedom to separate the d4-branes in the @xmath110 direction .",
    "can we identify the susy breaking terms introduced into the n=2 theory that leaves this n=0 theory ?",
    "we expect the n=2 susy in 10d string theory when broken by the string dynamics to appear as spontaneous susy breaking in the low energy field theory description .",
    "we also expect non - renormalizable operators to be suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "thus any susy breakings will be precisely those of the form of soft breakings that may be introduced through the vevs of spurion fields in the theory .",
    "the n=2 theory has a single spurion field @xmath13 which is a member of a full n=2 spurion multiplet . that multiplet has three real auxilliary fields that may acquire susy breaking vevs , the complex f - component of the matter field and the real d component of the gauge field .",
    "these spurion breakings have been investigated in @xcite and give rise to the bare uv soft breakings        these softly broken theories have been studied @xcite for small soft breakings in su(2 ) gauge theory with up to three flavors and the theories have been seen to confine and have a mass gap on the scale of the soft breaking with a dual weakly coupled ir description . the n=0 theories with matter fields appear to have the motions described above that move the theory to a dual description . if the identification of the n=0 theories is correct though there are no massless adjoint fermions and if the electric and dual theories had massless fermions would not match anomalies .",
    "the duality presumably continues to hold in the spirit of @xcite as a dual meissner description of confinement .",
    "although the holomorphic properties of supersymmetry are lost in these brane configurations it remains to be seen whether they can shed further light on softly broken theories .",
