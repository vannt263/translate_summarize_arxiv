    "the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , which is a highly predictive version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) based on universal boundary conditions @xcite , can be further restricted by being embedded in a supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) with a gauge group containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this can lead @xcite to ` asymptotic ' yukawa unification ( yu ) @xcite , i.e. the exact unification of the third generation yukawa coupling constants at the susy gut scale @xmath8 . indeed , assuming that the electroweak higgs superfields @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the third family right handed quark superfields @xmath11 , @xmath12 form @xmath7 doublets , we obtain @xcite the asymptotic yukawa coupling relation @xmath13 and , hence , large @xmath14 .",

    "this is due to the generation of sizeable susy corrections @xcite to @xmath25 ( about 20@xmath26 ) , which arise from sbottom - gluino ( mainly ) and stop - chargino loops @xcite and have the sign of @xmath0 ( with the standard sign convention of ref .",

    "consequently , for both signs of @xmath0 , yu leads to an unacceptable @xmath27 , with the @xmath4 case being much less disfavored .",

    "the higgs @xmath15 doublets contained in this superfield can naturally develop @xcite subdominant vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and mix with the main electroweak doublets which are assumed to be @xmath6 singlets and form a @xmath7 doublet .",
    "this mixing can , in general , violate @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the resulting electroweak doublets @xmath9 , @xmath10 do not form a @xmath7 doublet and break @xmath6 too . as a consequence , a moderate violation of the yu is obtained , which can allow an acceptable @xmath1-quark mass even with universal boundary conditions . obviously , a small deviation from yu is enough for an acceptable prediction of the @xmath1-quark mass when @xmath4 , while , for @xmath3 , a more pronounced deviation is needed .",

    "furthermore , the same model leads to a new shifted hybrid inflationary scenario @xcite , which avoids monopole overproduction at the end of inflation and reproduces the results on the quadrupole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) from the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the relevant part of inflation takes place at values of the inflaton field which are not much smaller than the planck scale and , thus , supergravity ( sugra ) corrections could easily invalidate it .",
    "it is , however , shown that inflation can be kept intact provided that an extra gauge singlet is introduced and a specific form of the khler potential is used .",

    "<S> the construction of specific supersymmetric grand unified models based on the pati - salam gauge group and leading to a set of yukawa quasi - unification conditions is briefly reviewed . for each sign of the parameter @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> an appropriately chosen condition from this set can allow an acceptable @xmath1-quark mass within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the restrictions on the parameter space which arise from the cold dark matter constraint , the inclusive decay @xmath2 , the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the collider bounds are also investigated . for @xmath3 , a wide and natural range of parameters is allowed . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath4 case not only is disfavored by the present experimental data on the muon anomalous magnetic moment , but also is excluded by the combination of the cold dark matter and @xmath5 requirements . in the @xmath3 case , the predicted neutralinos are possibly detectable in the future direct cold dark matter searches . moreover , the @xmath0 term is generated via a peccei - quinn symmetry and proton is practically stable . </S>",
    "<S> the same model gives rise to a new shifted inflationary scenario , which is based only on renormalizable terms , does not suffer from the problem of monopole overproduction at the end of inflation and is compatible with the cosmic microwave background radiation constraint . </S>",
    "<S> although the relevant part of inflation takes place at values of the inflaton field which are not much smaller than the reduced planck scale and , thus , supergravity corrections could easily invalidate inflation , this does not happen provided that an extra gauge singlet with a superheavy vacuum expectation value , which originates from d - terms , is introduced and a specific form of the khler potential is used . the constraint from the cosmic background explorer can again be met by readjusting the values of the parameters which were obtained with global supersymmetry . </S>"
