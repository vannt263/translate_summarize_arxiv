    "powerful radio galaxies display a very wide range of properties , both in their extended radio morphologies and in their optical spectra .",
    "historically , the luminous radio galaxy population has been sub - divided in two different manners .",
    "fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) classified sources according to their radio morphologies as type i ( fri ) , in which the peak of radio emission is located near the core ( edge  darkened ) , and type ii ( frii ) , in which the peak of surface brightness is at the edge of the radio lobes far from the center of emission ( edge  brightened ) .",
    "an alternative classification scheme is based on the relative intensity of high and low excitation lines in the optical spectrum ( cf . hine & longair 1979 ; laing et al .",
    "1994 ) , comprising high - excitation radio galaxies ( hergs ) and low - excitation radio galaxies ( lergs ) .",
    "the herg and lerg populations are believed to represent intrinsically different types of objects ( best & heckman 2012 ) .",
    "hergs show high accretion rate ( giving a total luminosity @xmath0 0.01 l@xmath1 , where l@xmath1 is the eddington luminosity ) powered via accretion of cold gas , which may be brought in through mergers or interactions , or through secular processes such as non - axisymmetric perturbations or star forming winds .",
    "in contrast , lergs show low accretion rates ( @xmath2 0.01 l@xmath1 ) and are believed to be powered primarily via accretion of hot intergalactic gas ( heckman & best 2014 ; yuan & narayan 2014 ) .",
    "the host galaxies of the herg and lerg populations are also different , with hergs typically being hosted by galaxies of lower stellar mass , bluer colours , lower concentration ( more disk - like ) and lower black hole mass ( best & heckman 2012 ) . the redshift evolution is also different for the two samples : hergs show rapid cosmic evolution , while lergs have little or no redshift evolution ( best et  al .  2014 ; pracy et  al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "two main descriptions have been proposed for the origin of the fr dichotomy .",
    "early studies highlighted the different emission line properties of fris and friis ( zirbel & baum 1995 ) , and proposed that fris and friis might be intrinsically different classes of objects , according to their central black hole parameters or jet content ( baum , zirbel & odea 1995 ; meliani , keppens & sauty 2010 ) .",
    "however , these emission line differences may be driven by the lerg / herg classification , since in the samples studied there was a large overlap between the fri and lerg populations , and friis with hergs .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that the fr dichotomy is extrinsic , driven by the role of the host galaxy and surrounding environment . in this scenario ,",
    "fri and frii radio galaxies are considered as fundamentally the same class of objects , with fris hosting less powerful jets which get disrupted by interactions in a dense surrounding environment ( kaiser & best 2007 ) . in support of this model ,",
    "several studies report an increased prevalence of fris in denser environment compared to friis ( hill & lilly 1991 ; gendre et  al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , the discovery of sources with hybrid morphologies , which are fri on one side and frii on the other side , strongly supports extrinsic models ( gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ; gawronski et  al .",
    "2006 ; ceglowski , gawronski & kunert - bajraszewska 2013 ) .",
    "however the origin of the fr dichotomy might be related to a combination of environment and central engine properties ( wold , lacy & armus 2007 ) .",
    "the fr dichotomy has also been investigated through hydrodynamical and magneto - hydrodynamical simulations that have argued the jet disruptions can emerge from kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( perucho et  al .",
    "2010 ) , jet - stellar wind interactions ( wykes et  al .",
    "2015 ) or magnetic instabilities ( porth & komissarov 2015 ; tchekhovskoy & bromberg 2015 ) ; these all favour the extrinsic scenario .",
    "studies of the evolution of the space density of fr radio galaxies over redshift ( clewley & jarvis 2004 ; sadler et  al .  2007 ; rigby , best & snellen 2008 ; gendre et  al .",
    "2010 ) , the host galaxy properties ( heckman et al . 1994 ; baum et  al .  1992 , 1995 ;",
    "govoni et  al .",
    "2000 ; scarpa & urry 2001 ) and the black hole accretion mechanism ( gendre et  al .",
    "2013 ) have all helped us to understand the nature of fr dichotomy ; however , it is still unclear what combination of intrinsic and extrinsic scenarios gives the most realistic description .",
    "a primary reason for this is because the extended morphologies of radio galaxies show a strong dependence on radio luminosity , and so does their herg / lerg nature , and thus disentangling the two effects is challenging .",
    "an example of this is the study of the cosmic evolution of the different radio source classes .",
    "it has been long - established that less powerful radio sources show less cosmic evolution than more powerful samples ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1993 and references therein ; rigby et al .",
    "it has therefore been concluded that fri sources with low radio powers show no redshift evolution ( clewley & jarvis 2004 ) , while higher power fri or frii have rapid redshift evolution ( rigby , best & snellen 2008 ; gendre , best & wall 2010 ) . however , none of these previous studies took herg / lerg classifications into account .",
    "more recent studies of the redshift evolution of herg / lerg objects have shown that hergs evolve very strongly and lergs show little cosmic evolution , indicating that the luminosity dependence of the cosmic evolution might be driven by the changing relative contributions of herg / lerg populations with luminosity ( best & heckman 2012 ; best et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the motivation for the present study is to separate fri / ii dependencies from herg / lerg dependencies , using four samples of fri hergs , fri lergs , frii hergs and frii lergs to investigate fri / frii and herg / lerg properties independently .",
    "the host galaxy properties , together with environmental and galaxy interaction parameters will be investigated for all sub - samples .    additionally , while fr radio galaxies have been identified by their extended morphologies",
    ", there is a class of compact radio sources which have no extended components in their radio structure .",
    "baldi , capetti & giovannini ( 2015 ) suggested a new type of radio galaxies called fr0 , corresponding to compact sources in this study , which are more core dominated and display less extended radio emission compared to fri / ii radio galaxies .",
    "these compact radio galaxies dominate the population at lower radio luminosities ( e.g. best et  al .",
    "studying compact radio sources can help us to determine whether these objects go through the same evolutionary path as the extended sources , and may shed light on the origin of different radio morphologies observed for radio galaxies .",
    "previous studies have claimed that these compact sources may be : i ) the same as the extended sources , but with radio jets and lobes viewed at a small angle to their axis ( blandford & k@xmath3nigl 1979 ; fanti et  al .",
    "1990 ) ; ii ) young radio sources at the early stage of their evolution , which will later become fri or frii ( fanti et  al .",
    "1995 ) ; iii ) short - lived radio galaxies , whose jets get disrupted due to the low jet bulk speed ( hence unable to sustain extended radio jets ) , perhaps caused by a lower black hole spin ( baldi , capetti & giovannini 2015 ) or interaction with the dense gas ( odea & baum 1997 ; alexander 2000 ) ; iv ) a fundamentally different class of objects which do not have potential of developing extended radio jets . in this study",
    ", we investigate the environment and host galaxy properties of compact radio sources , comparing them with the extended sources in order to examine the above scenarios .    the layout of our paper is as follows .",
    "the radio source samples and classifications are presented in section 2 .",
    "results considering the overall differences of fris and friis ( irrespective of herg / lerg classification ) are shown in section 3 , and compared to the literature .",
    "our main result , considering fri / frii , herg / lerg and compact / extended comparisons using matched samples that remove other dependencies , are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss radio galaxies with special and complex morphologies , for which our classification produces significant samples .",
    "we summarise and draw conclusions in section [ sec : summery ] . throughout the paper we assumed a @xmath4 cosmology with the following parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 where @xmath9 = 0.70 .",

    "35 sources were classified as hybrid sources ( gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ) , which display an fri - like morphology on one side of the nucleus and an frii - like morphology on the opposite side .",
    "a further 40 sources were deemed to be unclassifiable . additionally some sources presented interesting morphologies which were given additional flags .",
    "these are 5 double - double sources ( schoenmakers et  al .",
    "2000 ) , 9 head - tail sources ( rudnick & owen 1976 ) and 53 wide - angle tailed sources ( cf . owen & rudnick 1976 ) .",
    "examples of each of these sources are shown in figure  @xmath19 .",
    "the source classifications for the full sample of sources are given in table  @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to classifying the morphology , the visual analysis confirmed the nvss and first components of which the sources were comprised , allowing total fluxes ( and hence luminosities ) and radio source sizes to be determined .",
    "these properties are also provided in table  @xmath20 .",
    "total radio fluxes were obtained by summing across the nvss component fluxes ; these should be reliable for sources with sizes upto @xmath21 arcsec ( the largest angular size observable in snapshot observations with the vla at 1.4ghz in d - array configuration ) , but may be underestimated for sources larger than this size ( of which there are only 3 ) .",
    "source sizes are determined from the maximum angular separation of the centroids of the catalogued nvss and/or first components of the source .",
    "these may marginally underestimate the sizes of poorly resolved sources , but should provided a good approximation .",
    "furthermore , the sizes of fri sources are likely to be underestimated , since the emission from these gets progressively fainter with distance from the nucleus , and the most extended emission is likely to be missed by the short observations of nvss and first .      for the goal of this paper , additional constraints have also been applied to the sample .",
    "we applied an upper redshift cut of @xmath22 due to the completeness limits in spectroscopic classification of hergs and lergs ( see section 2.4 ) , and in finding companion galaxies for environmental studies ( see section 2.5 ) .",

    "fri sources have , on average , lower redshifts than friis , as expected in a flux - limited sample since they are typically found at lower luminosities .",
    "the distribution of angular sizes of fri / frii populations are shown in fig .",
    "it is notable that there is a dearth of fri sources with angular sizes below 20 arcsec .",
    "this is believed to be due to the biases in classification of the sources arising from the low angular resolution and low surface brightness sensitivity of first .",
    "small - scale fri sources , especially those whose extended emission is faint , may well be catalogued by first as a single ( albeit extended ) component , and thus excluded from our analysis ( which was restricted to multi - component sources ; see section 2.1 ) . to avoid these biases in our further analysis",
    ", we hereafter restrict both fri and frii samples to the objects with angular sizes above 20@xmath25 . the final sample size for each classification",

    "these correspond to those sources identified as single - component first sources in the best & heckman ( 2012 ) sample , with the same additional constraints : i ) objects only within the sdss ` main galaxy ' or ` luminous red galaxy ' samples , ii ) with the redshift cuts of 0.03 @xmath2 z @xmath2 0.1 , iii ) and the flux density cut of s @xmath0 40 mjy . the redshift distribution of compact sources are also shown in fig .",

    "the diagonal line represents equality between the two scales ( though , note these are differently defined , as the radio size is the full size of the sources whereas the optical size is a half - light radius ) .",
    "compact radio sources are distributed around the equality line while extended sources are at the larger radio sizes .",
    "therefore , the fri and frii sources typically extend well beyond their host galaxies and are large enough to be affected by the surrounding environment as well as conditions within their host galaxy which are both subjects of this study .",
    "we will consider both the extended and compact samples in section 4 .",
    "the method used to classify sources into the two class of herg and lerg has been extensively described by best & heckman ( 2012 ) who considered the ratios of four high excitation lines ( [ oiii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] and [ oi ] ) to the h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 emission lines , and also the equivalent width of the [ oiii ] emission line .",
    "they used the line - ratio diagnostic diagrams from kewley et  al .",

    "we adopt the source classifications derived by best & heckman .",

    "the radio sample including herg / lerg classifications is presented in table  @xmath31 .    using these classifications together with the morphological classifications from section  2.2 ,",
    "the sample has been divided into six sub - samples of fri hergs , fri lergs , frii hergs , frii lergs , compact hergs and compact lergs with which we can study how the environment and host galaxy properties relate separately to the herg / lerg and fri / frii / compact classifications .",

    "in contrast , wold et  al . ( 2007 ) argue that fri and frii have the same black hole mass distribution , but they also argue that for fris with low - excitation spectra the black hole masses correlates with radio luminosity , so sample selection limits might explain this difference .",

    "no remarkable differences are observed in the distribution of sizes of the host galaxies ( r@xmath11 ) .",

    "( 2005 ) showed that the stellar populations of fr i galaxies are , on average , older than those of friis .",
    "comparing the environments of fris with friis , on average friis clearly reside in lower density environments than fris , and are affected by slightly lower tidal forces .",
    "they also have lower pca1 that confirms they are typically in lower density regions .",
    "both samples show similar pca2 distributions , indicating that the small differences in tidal forces might be a projection effect associated with the denser environments of fris .",

    "finally , fris have also brighter cores in radio , which is expected as this is part of their definition ( fig .",
    "@xmath47 , left panel ) .",
    "as the plots show , many of these differences might also have emerged from a study of the herg / lerg dichotomy , as clear differences are also seen between herg and lerg objects at those parameters .",
    "for instance , hergs appear to have higher total radio luminosity , lower black hole mass , bluer colours , and reside in lower density environments than lergs ( figs  @xmath46-  @xmath47 ) .",
    "the result for the black hole mass has been previously reported by best & heckman ( 2012 ) while both higher ( smith & heckman 1989 ) and lower ( gendre et  al .",
    "2013 ) galaxy interaction have been reported for the herg sources .",
    "it is noticeable that in some properties , the herg / lerg separation appears to be a stronger driving factor than fri / ii differences : in particular , it is predominantly the herg population ( both fri and frii ) which have weaker 4000@xmath37 breaks and bluer colours than typical galaxies of their stellar mass .",
    "therefore , a lot of observed differences between fris and friis may be caused by the herg / lerg nature of the fr sources , and this issue has caused lots of misunderstanding and confusion in the study of fr radio galaxies when herg / lerg classification is not taken into account .    in order to obtain a clean picture of fri / frii differences and understand their causes to explain the morphological dichotomy observed at radio galaxies , we need to remove possible herg / lerg biases .",
    "we also need to remove biases with the host galaxy mass and radio luminosity , since figs  @xmath46-  @xmath47 make clear that many parameters correlate strongly with these properties .",
    "the method we adopt for that in the next section is to construct populations of fri vs frii , herg vs lerg and compact vs extended sources , having the same distribution of stellar mass , total radio luminosity or core radio luminosity , redshift and excitation class .",
    "we only confine the matching criteria to these parameters , in order to keep the sample of each type large enough to achieve robust statistics .",
    "for each of fri / frii , herg / lerg and compact / extended sources , we construct matched sample of objects in the l@xmath50m@xmath10 plane by randomly selecting pairs within a certain tolerance ( detailed below ) in l@xmath50 and m@xmath10 ( two dimensional ( 2d ) matching ) .",
    "hence , we remove all of the mass - dependent and luminosity - dependent effects seen in the set of plots discussed in section 3 .",
    "we then consider the normalized cumulative histogram of each physical parameter for each class of objects , and apply the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to assess whether the matched samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the ks test calculates the significance of the maximum difference ( d ) between two distributions , and assigns a probability ( p ) according to the parameter d and the number of objects in the samples .",
    "we consider differences with a probability above 95 percent to be significant . finally , we repeat the analysis up to 1000 times ( with different random selections for the source pairing ) and calculate the average d and then the significance from that .    we also constructed three dimensional ( 3d ) matched samples by adding redshift ( z ) to l@xmath50 and m@xmath10 , and repeat the previous steps using a matched sample in l@xmath51m@xmath10z space . in this way",
    ", we remove any effect of cosmic evolution ( expected to be small ) and more importantly any potential redshift biases in parameter estimation , in addition to the mass and luminosity .",
    "this results in smaller samples , due to the more restrictive matching requirements .",

    "these environmental results are consistent with those of gendre et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) who have reported low density environments for hergs independent of fr morphology .",
    "it is worth mentioning that by comparing hergs and lergs using a sample of frii hergs and frii lergs , without cross - matching for luminosity and mass , we get the same result but with lower significance .    these results are consistent with the currently favoured description of herg and lerg origins , which associated the differences to eddington - scaled accretion rates on to the black hole ( see discussions in heckman & best 2014 ) .",
    "hergs require high accretion rates fuelled from extensive cold gas reservoirs ; this gas - rich environment is more readily available in later - type disky galaxies with lower concentration and higher star formation , as seen in the data .",
    "their low density environments are also consistent with their fueling mechanisms , in a sense that in high density environments galaxies tend to be gas - poor , due to a combination of processes including stripping and strangulation ( cf .",
    "boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , galaxy groups and clusters have giant elliptical galaxies in their center with the high black hole masses , high concentration , old stellar population and little cold gas remaining to feed the central nuclei , but do have the cooling of hot gas which can provide the low accretion rates necessary to fuel lergs ( e.g. best & heckman 2012 ) : these are exactly the properties found for the lerg sources .    these arguments can also help to explain the overlap of friis with hergs and fris with lergs ; these have their origin in both radio luminosity and environment .",
    "the higher accretion rates required to fuel hergs also lead to more powerful radio jets , which are more likely to be able to survive the disrupting effects of their surrounding environments and become frii sources ; only as minority form fris .",
    "in contrast , at the lower accretion rates of lergs , the lower power jets are more likely to be disrupted and become fris , although there remains a significant population of lerg friis where the jets manage to survive .",
    "this connects to the host galaxy and surrounding environment , responsible for disrupting the jets , which also provides links between the fr classification and the excitation state .",
    "friis and hergs both are favoured in lower density environments and later - type galaxies , since these both offer a more plentiful supply of cold gas to provide higher fuelling rates , and less potential to disrupt the jets .",

    "we investigate compact radio agn and compare them with the extended fr radio sources . the main question that we address is which scenarios for the origin of compact agn fit best with the observations : are the compact sources a fundamentally different class of objects , are they fr radio galaxies at the early stage of their evolutions , or are they short - lived sources which die before they extend to large distances ?    the selection criteria for each class are presented in section 2 .",
    "@xmath63 shows the total and core radio luminosity of both the compact and extended samples versus stellar mass .",
    "compact sources have , on average , lower total radio luminosity while extended radio sources have lower core radio luminosity .",

    "@xmath47 , right panel ) .",
    "the core luminosity has been argued to be a better gauge of jet power than total radio luminosity , as it is a measure of instantaneous power , rather than something averaged over time and influenced by environment ; even at fixed jet power , the total luminosity of a radio source evolves as the source grows , going first up then down according to current models of radio source growth ( e.g.  kaiser & alexander 1999 ; turner & shabala 2015 ) . on the other hand , core luminosity",
    "may sometimes be affected by relativistic beaming ( see the discussion in , e.g. , marcha et  al .  2005 ; sadler et  al .",
    "total luminosity might be a good gauge if the compact sources were simply small , caught early in their life and perhaps shorter lived than fri / ii .",

    "compact and extended objects with the same distribution of total radio luminosity show @xmath095% significant differences in only 4000@xmath37 break and [ oiii ] luminosity : compact objects have younger stellar populations and higher line luminosity , both of which imply there is more cold gas available either for star formation or agn fueling in these objects .",
    "there is also a consistent trend of differences ( but below 95 percent significance in each individual case ) in concentration , colour and size of the host galaxy , all of which point towards compact radio sources being found in galaxies with stronger disk - like components , consistent with the higher star - formation rates .",
    "no significant environmental differences have been detected .",
    "prestage & peacock ( 1988 ) previously argued that compact radio sources lie in regions of lower galactic density than extended sources ; our results show a weak trend in that direction , but at below 95@xmath52 statistical significance .",
    "it is possible that their result was partially driven by stellar mass and/or radio luminosity differences between their samples .",
    "finally , the results show that the matched samples of compact and extended sources have similar distribution of black hole mass , which supports the correlation of black hole mass and average jet power .",
    "interesting results come out when we matched the radio luminosity of the core for both samples . in this case , the only significant difference that is observed between the two samples is in the black hole mass .",
    "there is no difference in [ oiii ] luminosity .",
    "this result shows that core radio luminosity is correlated to the [ oiii ] luminosity , as previously discussed by baldi , capetti & giovannini ( 2015 ) .",
    "they showed that compact lergs lie in the same region of the [ oiii ] versus core luminosity plane that fri lergs do .",
    "therefore , when we matched in core radio luminosity we consequently matched in [ oiii ] luminosity .",
    "the second important result is that again no environmental differences have been detected .",
    "this completely rules out a scenario in which jet disruption by the dense galactic and intergalactic environment causes the radio morphological differences between compact and extended objects .",
    "it also rules out any model in which equivalent jets are launched in the two cases , but that in low density environments the lack of a strong working surface causes the jet to escape without producing luminous extended radio emission ( giving the impression of a compact source ) .",
    "the most important result is that , by having the same environmental and host galaxy properties observed in core - matched compact and extended sources , the morphological differences appear to have their origin in the black hole mass .",
    "the lower black hole mass in compact sources seems to be less efficient at launching stable large - scale radio jets , or is able to support these jets for much shorter periods of time .",
    "this result is consistent with these of baldi , capetti & giovannini ( 2016 ) who claim compact sources ( or type fr0s , as they named compact lergs ) have smaller jet lorentz factor compared to fris . on a broader scale , a black - hole mass _ vs",

    "( more specifically , some of the compact objects may well be caused by one of these effects , but the full population can not be  there must also be other effects at work ) . furthermore , the differences are not driven in any way by different environments of the sources .",

    "some examples of these sources in our sample are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath19 .",
    "given the small sample sizes , only qualitative conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the wats and ht lie systematically towards the lower part of the r@xmath11m@xmath10 distribution , suggesting that they have smaller host galaxies compared to fris and friis .",
    "they also seem to have higher total radio luminosity .",
    "the clearest result , however , comes from the environment properties of these sources .",
    "ht and wats are found to reside in the densest environments , which is exactly as expected since these are understood to be shaped when the radio jet emission is bent by the relative movement of the galaxies through the intra - cluster medium . therefore , wat and ht can be efficiently used to identify overdensities ( blanton et  al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; dehghan et  al .  2014 ; obrien et  al .",
    "2016 ) especially in the distant universe where the current resolution and sensitivity of x - ray observations do not allow deep exploration .",
    "this study provides a rich sample of wat ( 53 ) and ht ( 9 ) radio sources ( see table  [ table1 ] ) , distributed over the redshift range of 0.03 - 0.4 , and deeper radio surveys will soon allow these to be selected to higher redshifts .    likewise ,",
    "although there is only one d - d source , it is interesting that this lies exactly at the lowest density part of the density  tidal plane .",
    "again this is what would be expected , since d - d sources are usually giant radio galaxies , and low density environments allow these to be achieved by the jet expanding freely .",
    "the frhs are not found in any special region of parameter space , although we ca nt make any strong statements on the basis of just a few sources .",
    "more information about these frhs could be gleaned by deriving and examining host galaxy and environment parameters for the wider sample of 35 sources presented over the full redshift range in table  [ table1 ] , but this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "we have studied powerful radio galaxies with a wide range of radio structures , from compact to very extended double - lobe radio sources , and with a very different optical spectrum , in order to understand the origin of the observed differences .",
    "the radio sources and their corresponding host galaxies were obtained from best & heckman ( 2012 ) who have cross - matched dr7 of the sdss with the nvss and first catalogues .",
    "the radio galaxy sample has been divided into compact and extended radio sources according to their radio morphologies .",
    "the extended radio galaxies known as fanaroff  riley ( fr ) radio galaxies have been visually divided into type i ( fri ) and type ii ( frii ) , with a few additional sources classified as hybrid , wide - angle tailed , head - tail and double - double radio galaxies . the resultant catalogue , which is presented here , provides a precious sample of over a thousand fr - classified radio galaxies brighter than @xmath67mjy , out to @xmath68 .",
    "the subset of radio sources with @xmath69 have also been divided into high excitation ( herg ) and low excitation ( lerg ) radio galaxies according to their optical spectrum .",
    "herg and lerg sources are understood to correspond to the sources with high rate of cold accretion flow and low rate of hot accretion flow respectively .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to investigate the differences in the host galaxies and environment of the fri / ii and compact sources with herg and lerg nature separately , in order to disentangle which effects cause each of the fri / ii , compact / extended and herg / lerg dichotomies .",
    "we investigated the fri / frii dichotomy using a sample of fri lergs and frii lergs with the same stellar mass and total radio luminosity distribution , to remove any biases caused by herg / lerg nature , mass and radio luminosity .",
    "we show that fris are hosted by smaller galaxies with higher concentration , higher mass surface density , and higher black hole to stellar mass ratio than the friis , consistent with the galaxies possessing less disky structure .",
    "the environment of the fri radio galaxies show higher density and richness .",
    "all the results are consistent with the models that employ extrinsic parameters ( i.e. jet disruption by the interstellar and intergalactic media ) to explain the fri / frii dichotomy .",
    "previous studies that focussed on intrinsic differences were all biased by the herg / lerg classification in the sense that most of them compare fri lergs with the frii hergs .",
    "we investigated the environment and the host galaxy properties of hergs and lergs using a sample of combined fri / ii and compact hergs with fri / ii and compact lergs , matched in classification , mass and total radio luminosity .",
    "we confirm that hergs are hosted by galaxies with smaller 4000@xmath37 break , higher [ oiii ] luminosity and lower black holes mass with bluer colour and lower concentration compared to the lergs  independent of fr classification .",
    "these all indicate that hergs are found in more star - forming and disky galaxies .",
    "the environments of lergs display higher density compared to the hergs .",
    "these results support the hypothesis that the agn fueling source is the main origin of herg / lerg dichotomy . in dense environments and massive elliptical galaxies the agn fueling source",
    "is believed to be primarily the hot intergalactic gas which cools and accretes on to the central black hole at a low accretion rate , giving rise to lergs . in low density environments ( without hot haloes ) , depending on the availability of cold gas , herg radio sources may form .",
    "therefore , herg sources are found in more star - forming and disky galaxies , more typically in lower density environments , with a higher prevalance of cold gas .",
    "we also investigated the compact / extended dichotomy by comparing a combined sample of fri and ii lergs with a sample of compact lergs , matched in stellar mass and either core or total radio luminosity .",
    "in neither case did we find any difference in the agn environment , indicating that this is not a cause of the dichotomy .",
    "we confirm that the [ oiii ] luminosity distributions are the same when matched in core radio luminosity but not in total radio luminosity , suggesting that the core radio luminosity is the better measure of the current accretion power . in the core",
    "luminosity matched samples , the only parameter which showed a significant difference between compact and extended radio sources is the black hole mass : compact objects harbour lower mass black holes .",
    "this result implies that lower mass black holes are either less efficient at launching stable large - scale radio jets ( consistent with the interpretation of baldi et  al .",
    "2016 ) , or able to do so for a shorter time such that these sources are short - lived .",
    "finally , we explored the host galaxy and environment properties of radio galaxies with more complex and interesting morphologies such as wide - angle tailed , head - tail , double - double , and fr hybrid .",
    "although the samples are too small to draw quantitative conclusions , we confirm that ht and wat reside in very dense regions compared to the whole population , offering the prospect to identify over - dense regions such as galaxy clusters and groups through radio observation alone .",
    "this will be a powerful tool in next - generation radio surveys .",
