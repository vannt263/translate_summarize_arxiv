    "the individual worms entangle above a critical concentration to form viscoelastic gels .",
    "wormlike micelles relax stress through two mechanisms : reptation , analogous to polymers , and by scission and recombination @xcite . due to the latter process of relaxing stress ,",
    "wormlike micelles show extreme shear - thinning behaviour and this shows up as a flat plateau in the flow curve ( stress vs. shear rate ) .",

    "banding systems , the system splits into coexisting bands that support the same stress but have different average shear rates .",
    "the high shear rate band is lower in viscosity and is the nematic phase , while the low shear band has a higher viscosity and is the isotropic phase .",
    "stress relaxation measurements in the plateau region of the flow curve for viscoelastic gels of surfactant cetyltimethyammonium tosylate ( ctat ) showed chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "inspite of the short data trains analysed ( @xmath0 5000 data points ) , owing to the low dimensional nature of the attractors , the phase space dynamics could be quantified in terms of lyapunov exponents and fractal correlation dimensions .",
    "this phenomenon , termed rheochaos , has now been observed in many other systems @xcite and recently the route to rheochaos has also been observed .",
    "ganapathy and sood have shown that the route to rheochaos is via type - ii intermittency in stress relaxation measurements @xcite for wormlike micellar gels of surfactant ctat in the presence of salt sodium chloride ( nacl ) .",
    "depolarised small angle light scattering measurements done simultaneously with flow experiments showed that the depolarised scattered intensity , sensitive to orientational order fluctuations , showed similar dynamics as that of the stress / shear rate @xcite .    in the experiments reported so far @xcite",
    ", spatial inhomogeneity always accompanies rheochaos .",
    "spatial inhomogeneity has been captured in many recent theoretical models of rheochaos @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model relevant to the work described in this paper , proposed by chakrabarti _",
    "@xcite , is a spatial extension of the homogeneous model first proposed by hess _",
    "this model treats the system as an orientable fluid and considers the spatio - temporal evolution of the symmetric traceless nematic order parameter @xcite .",
    "the equations of the motion of the stress are not fundamental but are derived from the underlying dynamics of the alignment tensor or the local orientational order parameter .",
    "an important assumption here is that the orientational order parameter equations are studied in the passive advection approximation i.e. the effect of the stress field , arising from orientational ordering , on the flow profile is ignored .",
    "although this model ignores features specific to wormlike micelles like breaking and recombination and shear induced elongation or breaking of the micelles , it captures the essential orientable nature of the worms under flow .",
    "this model also predicts the route to rheochaos to be via spatiotemporal intermittency @xcite .",
    "given this strong theoretical backing , it would indeed be useful to check if there exists any cause and effect relationship between the time series of stress and the depolarised scattered intensity that were measured experimentally for the ctat + nacl system @xcite .",
    "if the passive advection approximation used in the theoretical model @xcite described above is indeed justified , one should expect to find that the orientational order has a stronger causal influence on the stress than vice versa .",

    "we show that there exists a granger feedback mechanism between the two time series and that the depolarised intensity or nematic ordering has a stronger influence on the stress than vice versa . secondly ,",
    "since standard nonlinear time series analysis procedures fail to quantify the dynamics of the chaotic region in intermittent data due to insufficient data points , we have used the method of cross recurrence plots ( crps ) .",
    "we have analysed a data train that shows type - ii intermittency and we find that the stress and orientational order ( depolarised intensity ) share similar phase space behaviour in the laminar and chaotic regions .",

    "quantitatively speaking , @xmath2 has a causal influence on @xmath1 , if the variance of the prediction errors of @xmath1 decreases on including information from @xmath2 .",

    "the errors in prediction are given by @xmath21 and @xmath7 .",
    "the reconstruction and the fitting procedure are now performed on the individual time series @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the same local neighborhood and the errors @xmath4 and @xmath22 are determined .",
    "the error ratios var@xmath23/var@xmath12 and var@xmath24/var@xmath5 are computed . since for a nonlinear system ,",
    "causal inferences can not be made by studying a single local neighborhood , the entire process described above is repeated for various regions on the attractor and the average of the error ratios are computed . the extended granger causality index ( egci )",
    "is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 stands for the average .",
    "the egci is now computed as a function of the neighborhood size @xmath20 . for linear systems",
    "this index will remain roughly constant as @xmath20 decreases , whereas for nonlinear systems , in the small @xmath20 limit , the egci reveals the true nature of the causal influence .",
    "a major drawback of standard nonlinear time series analysis routines is the requirement of a long time series .",
    "one of the techniques developed to overcome this limitation is the method of recurrence plots ( rps ) @xcite .",
    "rps is a tool used to visualise phase space trajectories and as the name suggests rps represent the recurrence of trajectories in phase space , a basic feature of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "the first step towards generating rps is to completely unfold the attractor . using the taken s embedding theorem ,",
    "the phase space trajectory , @xmath27 , can be reconstructed by time delayed vectors of the time series @xmath1 , [ crp_1 ] * x*(t ) = = ( x(t),x(t-_1), ... ,x(t-(m-1 ) ) ) . here",

    "if @xmath32 falls within distance @xmath29 of @xmath33 , then the two trajectories are close by in phase space and @xmath34 , else @xmath35 .",
    "the 1 s and 0 s are color coded and represented as a plot .",
    "a recent extension of rps to bivariate time series is the method of cross recurrence plots ( crps ) @xcite . here",
    "both the time series are simultaneously delay - embedded in the same phase space and a test for closeness of the two trajectories is carried out .",

    "trajectories that share similar local dynamics show up as diagonals .",
    "static regions in the trajectory are seen as vertical or horizontal structures . in order to be more quantitative , zilbut and webber",
    "have proposed the following recurrence measures @xcite .",
    "% recurrence : this is defined as the % of recurrence points falling within a given radius .",
    "% determinism : this is defined as the number of recurrence points forming diagonal line structures .",
    "the more % determinism , the more predictable is the signal .",
    "stochastic signals have no predictability , whereas chaotic signals have short - term predictability 3 .",
    "maxline : this is the length of the longest diagonal .",
    "this is inversely related to the maximum lyapunov exponent which measures the rate at which phase space trajectories diverge .",
    "entropy : this is the shannon information entropy and is a measure of randomness of the signal .",
    "it has units of bits / bin .",
    "a periodic signal has zero entropy since all the diagonal are of the same length .",
    "a random process has a finite non - zero shannon entropy .",
    "trend : this is a measure of the stationarity of the time series . 6 .",
    "% laminarity : this is a measure of the % of recurrence points forming vertical or horizontal line structures .",
    "7 . trapping time :",
    "this is a measure of the average length of the vertical or horizontal line structures .",
    "the last two measures were proposed by marwan _",
    "the data analysed in this paper were obtained from our earlier stress relaxation experiments on the wormlike micellar system of ctat 2wt% + 100 mm nacl described in detail in @xcite . under controlled shear rate conditions",
    "this system shows the type - ii intermittency route to rheochaos .",
    "we briefly describe here the method that was used in our earlier work for generating the bivariate time series of stress and depolarised intensity .",
    "the experiments were performed on a mcr 300 stress controlled rheometer with sals attachments at a temperature of 26.5@xmath36c .",
    "the experiments were carried out in a cylindrical couette geometry with top and bottom windows made of quartz glass ( inner cylinder diameter @xmath37 mm , height @xmath38 mm and gap @xmath39 mm ) . a vertically polarised ( v ) laser beam ( @xmath40 = @xmath41 nm and spot size @xmath42 mm ) enters the gap between the cylinders along the vorticity ( @xmath43 ) direction , where @xmath44 is the velocity field .",
    "an analyser below the couette geometry allows us to select either the vertically ( referred as vv ) or the horizontally polarised / depolarised scattered light ( referred as vh ) from the sample without disturbing the measurements .",
    "a condenser beneath the analyser collects the scattered light dominantly from a plane @xmath45 mm above the bottom plate and forms the image on a screen in the ( @xmath44 , @xmath46 ) plane . a 8-bit colour ccd camera ( lumenera 075c , 640 x 480 pixels , maximum frame rate - 60fps ) at a frame rate of 1 frame/750ms imaged the screen . about @xmath47 images",
    "were grabbed for each polarisation while stress relaxation measurements were simultaneously going on .",
    "the intensity at various wavevectors from the noise filtered image was measured and a time series was generated by repeating the process over each image .",
    "the data analysed in this paper are at a fixed wave vector , @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ figure1]a & b show the partial time series of the stress and the vh intensity at a fixed shear rate of 25 @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the time series shows intermittent behaviour characterised by the presence of laminar and chaotic regions .",
    "the reason for analysing this particular data set is two - fold : 1 . it would be worthwhile to check whether the two time series share similar phase space dynamics in the laminar and chaotic regions and 2 .",
    "the chaotic region of the time series can not be analysed using normal nonlinear time series analysis procedures due to the relatively short length of the chaotic regions .",
    "the laminar and chaotic regions of the time series are denoted as region - i and region - ii and are analysed individually .",
    "we first analyse region - i of the time series shown in fig .",

    "analysed , the error ratios are @xmath53 implying that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are better predicted when information from @xmath2 and @xmath1 are incorporated in the regression equations .",
    "the error ratios are at a minimum for @xmath54 . to understand the origin of the minimum in the ratio of the variances , we have evaluated the akaike information criteria ( aic ) @xcite for various model orders ( inset to fig .",
    "[ figure2]a ) .",
    "the optimal model order estimated from the aic yields a regression model order @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that there is maximal driving between the two time series ( fig . [ figure1 ] ) for this value of @xmath3 and leads to a minimum in the ratio of the variances ( fig .",

    "the time series is predicted using the various regression coefficients that were computed from eqns .",

    "this suggests that there exists a feedback mechanism between the stress and the vh intensity in the laminar region of the time series .",
    "we have carried out the linear causality analysis for the chaotic region of the time series also .",
    "we find that the variance of the prediction errors do not saturate even for large @xmath3 ( @xmath56 ) implying that a linear regression model is inappropriate to model the chaotic regions of the time series .    in order to determine the influence of nonlinear correlations in the time series on causality , we have carried out extended granger causality tests @xcite .",
