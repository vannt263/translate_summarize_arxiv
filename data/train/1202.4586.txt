    "recent radial velocity ( rv ) and transiting exoplanet surveys have resulted in the discovery of a large number of new exoplanetary systems .",
    "most stars are born in binary or multiple systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and indeed we observe that a reasonable fraction of the stars in the galaxy are multiple ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of additional stellar companions on the planet formation process are therefore of high interest to constrain and calibrate planet formation theories .",
    "+ a number of studies have been conducted on this subject in the past , such as described in @xcite or @xcite and most recently in @xcite and @xcite . as a result of these studies ,",
    "@xmath4 multiple stellar systems hosting exoplanets are known to date , suggesting that about @xmath5 % of all known exoplanets reside in such systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we present the results of our ongoing multiplicity study of the most recently ( since 2008 ) discovered rv exoplanet host stars .",
    "we utilized the calar alto 2.2 m telescope and the astralux instrument ( @xcite ) to achieve imaging data with higher strehl ratio compared to simple seeing - limited imaging .",
    "+ in the following section we characterize our sample . in section [ sec - obs ]",
    "we give a brief introduction to the observation technique as well as the instrument used and describe the reduction and astrometric calibration of our data . in section [ results ]",
    "we show all confirmed or rejected companion candidates with the associated proper motion analysis .",
    "we also present detection limits for all studied systems .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our findings .",
    "our sample consists of stars with rv planet candidates discovered between 2008 and 2011 .",
    "they are all observable from the northern hemisphere with declinations down to -22@xmath6 and a relatively even distribution in right ascension . since we want to test companionship of detected companion candidates via astrometry , we chose targets which are close enough to show a sufficient proper motion ( e.g. @xmath7 47mas / yr or approximately one astralux pixel per year ) to do a common proper motion analysis approximately one year after the first epoch images were taken .",
    "the distance distribution of our targets is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist - hist ] . on average",
    "our targets are 56.6pc away and show a proper motion of 180.4mas / yr equivalent to 3.8 pix / yr on the astralux instrument .",
    "+ the rv planet search technique favors main - sequence stars , therefore the average age of our target stars is 4.6gyr ( data as listed in exoplanet.eu by @xcite ) .",
    "spectral types range from late f to early m , with the majority being g and k type . in fig .",
    "[ fig : metall ] we show the metallicity distribution of our sample compared to the whole rv planet candidate host population .",
    "the average metallicity of our sample is slightly higher than solar metallicity at 0.09 .",
    "the metallicity distribution of our sample does not differ significantly from the whole population .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - sep - plot ] we present the minimum masses of detected rv planet candidates versus their semi - major axis for our sample and the whole population .",
    "the majority of the detected planet candidates are located within 2au of their hosts .",
    "the average minimum mass of our sample is 2.8m@xmath8 , as compared to 2.4m@xmath8 for the whole rv planet candidate population .",
    "given the standard deviation of 3.3m@xmath8 and 3.8m@xmath8 respectively this is not significant .",
    "+ the eccentricity distribution of rv planets around our sample stars can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] .",
    "we compared the eccentricity distribution of our sample to that of all rv planet candidates and found no significant differences .",
    "+ we conclude that the general properties of our sample resemble those of the whole population .",
    "to achieve high spatial resolution as well as high sensitivity , one must consider the effects of turbulent atmosphere . given the rayleigh criterion for the minimum resolvable angle of @xmath9 , the calar alto 2.2 m telescope has a theoretical resolution of @xmath10mas at a wavelength of @xmath11 nm , which is the central wavelength of the sdss _",
    "i_ filter which we are using .",
    "the median seeing at the calar alto site , however , is @xmath12arcsec ( @xcite ) , which is about @xmath13 times larger .",
    "+ the atmospheric conditions in the optical regime are subject to rapid variations with a timescale that can be approximated by the speckle coherence time @xmath14 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath15 is the fried - parameter and @xmath16 is the wind speed dispersion in the atmosphere . for a typical wind speed dispersion of @xmath17m@xmath18s@xmath19 at the calar alto site and a v - band seeing of @xmath20arcsec , @xmath21 is in the order of @xmath22ms ( @xcite ) . within @xmath21",
    "the resulting speckle pattern will remain fixed , whereas longer integration times would lead to an averaged and therefore `` smeared out '' speckle pattern .",
    "+ the lucky imaging approach consists of taking several thousand short images with integration times shorter than @xmath21 , to sample the speckle variations during the observation window .",
    "we then only choose the so called `` lucky shots '' with a very high strehl ratio in one of the speckles , to shift and add , resulting in a final image with the highest possible strehl ratio and therefore highest possible angular resolution .",
    "+ for an in - depth introduction to the lucky imaging technique please see @xcite .",
    "all observations were carried out with the calar alto 2.2 m telescope in combination with the astralux instrument .",
    "this instrument consists of a back - illuminated , electron - multiplying , frame transfer ccd , which is well suited for the lucky imaging observation technique . for a detailed description of the instrument , see @xcite .",
    "+ since we wanted to detect low - mass stellar or even brown dwarf companions of our targets , we chose the sdss _",
    "i_ filter as described in @xcite for all observations .",
    "this is the best choice taking into account the sensitivity of the detector and the brightness of the detectable companions , as well as the variability of the atmosphere . for calibration we took dome- and sky - flats at the beginning and/or end of each observation night .",
    "+ for all science targets we chose @xmath23ms of exposure time per frame , which is well below the typical speckle coherence time at the calar alto site .",
    "shorter exposure times would have led to significantly growing overheads since we would have needed to switch off the frame transfer mode of the instrument .",
    "longer exposure times would have resulted in a less localized and more `` smeared out '' speckle pattern .",
    "+ the electron - multiplying gain was individually adjusted for each target to obtain the maximum signal while still operating in the linear regime of the detector .",
    "we then took 100 dark frames with closed shutter and with the respective electron multiplying settings before the start of each acquisition sequence . +",
    "depending on weather conditions and time constraints we took between 10000 and 80000 frames per science target , which corresponds to a total integration time of @xmath24min and @xmath25min respectively for a typical frame selection rate of @xmath26% .",
    "the obtained astralux images are all reduced and processed with our own eso - midas ( munich image data analysis system ) software for the reduction of imaging data taken with the lucky imaging technique .",
    "the individual astralux images are dark - subtracted with the median ( for optimal suppression of cosmic ray artifacts ) of several short integrated dark - frames and flat - fielded . for the lucky imaging data processing , the reached strehl - ratio in all individual images",
    "is determined at first using the bright planet host star as strehl - probe .",
    "the frames are then ranked according to their strehl - ratio and only the best @xmath13 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28% of all frames , i.e. only the frames with the highest strehl - ratio , are then selected and combined using the shift+add technique .",
    "thereby , for image registration , the position of the brightest pixel in the speckle pattern of the planet host star is determined in all frames , which are then shifted and averaged .",
    "since we want to precisely measure separation and position angle of our companion candidates with respect to the primary stars , and the astralux instrument is not permanently mounted to the calar alto 2.2 m telescope , a careful astrometric calibration of the detector in each observation epoch is necessary . for this purpose",
    "we selected a sample of five wide binaries , for which precise hipparcos measurements as well as several additional observation epochs are available .",
    "we show our sample along with the hipparcos astrometry in table  [ tab : binaries ] .",
    "furthermore , we observed the center of the globular cluster m15 whenever possible , for which precise hst astrometry is available . + for each epoch",
    "we have a minimum of three calibrators which were observed in the same night as the science targets . for all calibrators we used the hipparcos measurement of epoch",
    "@xmath29 as reference point and then linearly fitted the slow orbital motion by using all data points available in the washington double star ( wds ) catalog . + the pixel scales and position angles of the calibration images for each individual calibrator were calculated using eso - midas for the position measurements of the binary components , and gaia ( graphical astronomy and image analysis tool ) for the respective measurements of the m15 cluster components ( using sextractor : software for source extraction by @xcite ) .",
    "the average of these calculations were used as final calibration for the respective epoch to cancel out systematic errors due to residual orbital motion of our binary stars .",
    "the final astrometric calibrations for all observation epochs are listed in table  [ tab : astrocal ] .",
    ".hipparcos astrometry of epoch 1991.25 of our calibration binaries [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the companion candidate ( @xcite ) at @xmath30arcsec separation could not be resolved",
    "in our ongoing study we observed @xmath0 planet host stars to date .",
    "of these @xmath0 systems , @xmath31 were already known to be multiple , for which we present follow up astrometry .",
    "thereby , we show for the first time conclusively , that the companion to hd126614 is indeed physically associated with the primary .",
    "as the planet host star hd126614 also exhibits a further companion at a wider separation ( hd216614c , sep@xmath32arcsec ( 3043 au ) , pa@xmath33 at 2mass epoch may 3th 2000 ) , the hd126614 system is actually a hierarchical triple system , the only one presently known in which the planet host star exhibits a close stellar companion .",
    "all other known planet host triples are composed of the planet host star and a binary - companion at wider separation .",
    "+ we also discovered one new low - mass ( @xmath1 ) stellar companion to the star hd185269 , with a separation of @xmath34arcsec at a position angle of @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath36au .",
    "hd185269a harbors a `` hot jupiter '' ( @xmath37 ) with an orbital period of @xmath38d and a semi - major axis of @xmath39au , detected by @xcite .",
    "they state that its orbital eccentricity of @xmath40 is large in comparison with other planets found within 1au of their host stars .",
    "this could possibly be explained by the kozai mechanism as described by @xcite .",
    "we used the formula @xmath41 to calculate the period of the kozai oscillations ( @xcite ) , where the indices 0 , 1 and 2 represent the host star , planetary and stellar companions respectively . assuming an eccentricity of 0.5 for the stellar companion ( as suggested by statistical analysis in @xcite ) , and a semi - major axis equal to the projected separation of 227au",
    ", we get a period of 1.7gyr . given the age of hd185269a of 4.2gyr ,",
    "this period is short enough so that the kozai effect might have altered the planetary companion s eccentricity and inclination .",
    "+ for the remaining @xmath42 target stars in our sample we can on average exclude all low - mass stellar companions of @xmath43 down to @xmath44arcsec around the primary . for many stars in our sample",
    "we get significantly deeper , enabling us to exclude all low - mass stellar companions outside of @xmath44arcsec and up to @xmath45arcsec . to further summarize our detection limits , in fig .",
    "[ fig : average - result ] we show the average dynamic range plot of all observations , with all detected stellar companions marked .",
    "+ 68 stars of our sample had an unknown multiplicity status before our observations .",
    "of those , only one proved to be multiple within the detection limits of our survey .",
    "this yields a multiplicity rate of only 1.5% for our sample .",
    "given that the multiplicity rate of the known exoplanet host population is about 17% , stellar multiple systems are underrepresented in our sample .",
    "however , since the sample size of our astralux survey is not yet statistically significant ( @xmath46 231 for 95% confidence level and an error margin of 5% ) we can not draw any conclusion for the whole exoplanet population . for a detailed statistical analyzis of the properties of all known stellar multiple systems harboring extrasolar planets , we refer to @xcite .",
    "+ we will continue our current monitoring campaign in order to determine the multiplicity status of all exoplanet host stars , which then will yield the true multiplicity rate of planet - bearing stars .",
    "this will also eventually allow us to draw conclusions about the frequency of planets in multiple stellar systems , as well as their properties compared to planets which reside around single stars .",
