    "let @xmath3 be a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in studying the minimal free resolution of @xmath5 , and specifically understanding the maps in this resolution .",
    "our approach is heavily dependent on using the combinatorial structure of the lattice of least common multiples , or lcm lattice , associated to @xmath3 , as well as the set of all such lattices for monomial ideals with a fixed number of generators .",
    "the lcm lattice was introduced by gasharov , peeva , and welker for the purpose of studying free resolutions of monomial ideals @xcite . in particular they show that two monomial ideals with isomoprhic lcm lattices have isomorphic minimal resolutions .",
    "this motivated phan to ask , and answer in the affirmative , the question of whether or not every finite atomic lattice can be realized as the lcm lattice of some monomial ideal @xcite .",
    "phan s work leads to the point of view that finite atomic lattices are `` abstract monomial ideals '' .    this paper concerns itself with two main types of results : to give a complete characterization of how abstract monomial ideals are coordinatized ; and to use the set of all finite atomic lattices with a fixed number of atoms to understand families of resolutions of monomial ideals .",
    "theorem [ coordinatizations ] gives a complete characterization of how to _ coordinatize _ a finite atomic lattice by associating a monomial ideal @xmath6 to a finite atomic lattice @xmath0 such that the lcm lattice of @xmath6 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , proposition [ realizable ] shows that all monomial ideals can be realized as coordinatizations of their lcm lattices .",
    "theorem [ ln ] is a restatement of phan s result which shows that the set @xmath1 of all finite atomic lattices with @xmath2 ordered atoms is itself a finite atomic lattice @xcite , and this idea is central to the rest of our work .",
    "our interest in studying @xmath1 is due to the fact that in this setting , total betti numbers are weakly increasing as one travels up chains in @xmath1 ( see theorem 3.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is related to lower semi - continuity of betti numbers under deforming the exponents of the monomial ideal .",
    "deformation of the exponents _ of a monomial ideal is a process by which one replaces a given monomial ideal @xmath3 with a `` deformed '' monomial ideal @xmath7 , where one or more ties between exponents on minimal generators is broken .",
    "bayer , peeva and sturmfels show that the minimal resolution of @xmath7 provides a ( not necessarily minimal ) resolution of @xmath3 ( see theorem 4.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of section  [ defosection ] is theorem  [ chains = defos ] , which states that every relation in @xmath1 can be realized as a deformation of exponents for some appropriate choice of coordinatization .",
    "ultimately we are interested in understanding questions such as : how can we control deformations of the exponents so that betti numbers do not increase ; and what can we say about the cellular structure of minimal resolutions depending on the location in @xmath1 ? in the remainder of this paper we focus on answering the latter problem as well as providing structural results that will be useful for considering either question .",
    "both theorem 5.3 in @xcite , and proposition 5.15 in @xcite describe simplicial complexes which support a minimal free resolution of a monomial ideal by virtue of being their scarf complex .",
    "proposition [ generalizationscarf ] generalizes this result by indicating a class of regular cw - complexes which supports the minimal free resolution of an ideal .",
    "additionally it is known that if @xmath8 in @xmath1 then any minimal resolution of @xmath0 is a resolution of @xmath9 ( see theorem 3.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "if this resolution of @xmath9 is minimal then it inherits any cellular structure which might have existed for the resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "propositions [ simplicialfilter ] and [ gensimpfilt ] show that to a certain extent the converse is true .",
    "namely that under certain hypotheses any cellular structure for a minimal resolution of @xmath9 can be lifted to a minimal resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "using this approach , of studying minimal resolutions of monomial ideals by examining the resolutions of `` nearby '' ideals in @xmath1 , may tempt one to make a comparison with the upper - semicontinuity of betti numbers along deformations of projective varieties in the hilbert scheme .",
    "however , a more apropos analogy may be with the macphersonian , which is a combinatorial version of the grassmannian @xcite , where monomial ideals play the role of vector spaces and finite atomic lattices replace oriented matroids . to develop a theory of combinatorial moduli spaces modeled on both of these examples",
    "is a subject for future study .",
    "further results in this paper are theorem [ gradedln ] , which states that @xmath1 is a graded lattice of rank @xmath2 , and other structural results in section [ structure ] describing covering relations and meet - irreducibles in this lattice .",
    "additionally , theorem [ genericcoords ] gives a lattice theoretic description of strongly generic monomial ideals .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor david bayer for imparting his intuition and knowldge as i worked on this project in fulfillment of my ph.d .",
    "i would also like to give special recognizition to jeff phan , whose thesis introduced the ideas which are continued in this paper .",
    "finally i d like to thank ezra miller for his support and interest in this project .",

    "this is the length of all maximal chains .",
    "the maximal element of @xmath1 is the lattice @xmath246 and @xmath247 . the minimal element of @xmath1 is the unique lattice on @xmath2 atoms where the atoms are also the coatoms , it has @xmath248 elements",
    ". then by [ coveringrelations ] every maximal chain in @xmath1 has length @xmath249 and so it is graded of rank @xmath250 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ gradedln ] that if @xmath1 is co - atomic then it will be isomorphic to @xmath246 . with the following description of the meet - irreducibles it is easy to see that the only case where this happens is for @xmath251 .",
    "[ meetirredln ] the number of meet irreducibles in @xmath1 is @xmath252    a lattice @xmath253 is meet irreducible if it is covered by only one element , call it @xmath9 . thinking of @xmath0 as a collection of subsets @xmath254",
    "then by proposition [ coveringrelations ] that means that there is only one way to add a subset to @xmath254 so that the resulting set of sets is closed under intersections .",

    "so @xmath268 is a meet semi - lattice .",
    "now we need to show that @xmath269 . to see that @xmath270 observe that the only candidates for elements to add to @xmath268 come from @xmath267 $ ] .",
    "choose such a @xmath271 such that @xmath272 .",
    "observe that @xmath273 from the above discussion .",
    "so @xmath274 which shows that if one can not only add @xmath271 to @xmath260 and still have a set which is closed under intersections .",
    "thus the only element covering @xmath260 is @xmath275 .    to see that @xmath276 , let @xmath277",
    "this means that there is only one element @xmath278 which covers @xmath209 . from this",
    "we can deduce that at minimum @xmath209 contains a minimal element , a maximal element and all @xmath2 atoms and does not include @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore since this is the only covering element , we can deduce that for every subset @xmath279 not in @xmath209 and not equal to @xmath170 there exists a subset @xmath280 in @xmath209 such that @xmath281 is not in @xmath209 . thus adding @xmath271 to @xmath209",
    "would not produce a covering relation .",
    "to see what conditions this forces on @xmath209 consider three types of subsets @xmath271 :    .2 in * type 1 : * @xmath271 is not comparable to @xmath282 + * type 2 : * @xmath283 + * type 3 : * @xmath272 + considering the subsets @xmath271 of type 1 of size 2 , it is clear that all of them must be elements of @xmath209 otherwise @xmath284 would also cover @xmath209 .",
    "once we have all the subsets of size 2 , the argument applies for all subsets of type 1 with size 3 , and so on until @xmath285 .",
    "so now @xmath209 must consist of all of @xmath286 , the atoms , and all subsets of type 1 .",
    "now , with all the subsets of type 1 in l consider the fact that @xmath287 needs to cover @xmath209 or in other words @xmath170 intersect any subset of type 1 needs to already be in @xmath209 .",
    "since we have all subsets that do not include or not included by @xmath170 this means that we need all subsets of sigma in @xmath209 .",
    "so , now @xmath209 must consist of @xmath286 , the atoms , and all subsets of type 1 and 2 .",
    "finally we need to consider subsets of type 3 . again",
    "if we start by considering such subsets which differ from @xmath170 by only one element ( i .. e @xmath288 ) it is easy to see that only one such @xmath271 can be included in @xmath209 since if there were more than one then @xmath209 would not be closed under intersections since @xmath289 . moreover",
    ", one such element must be included in @xmath209 otherwise there are more than one lattice covering @xmath209 .",
    "similar arguments apply for @xmath290 where @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "although here it is necessary that if @xmath293 that only the @xmath290 which include the @xmath294 already included into @xmath209 be included as well , and so on .",
    "so , we see that all of the elements so all of the elements of type 3 that we ve included contain @xmath168 , so it must be true that we ve included everything in @xmath246 except for the elements greater than @xmath170 and less than @xmath295 since these are precisely the elements of type three not containing @xmath168 .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath276 .",
    "now , all that remains is to count the number of elements in @xmath255 .",
    "first fix @xmath168 , there we see that the number of possible @xmath268 lattices is @xmath296 .",
    "this is because the number of subsets of size 2 or more in a set of @xmath285 elements is @xmath297 .",
    "finally we see that @xmath298 by letting @xmath168 range from 1 to @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we prove the main results of this paper which focus on how the geometric structure of minimal resolutions stabilize as one moves up chains in a fixed total betti stratum .",
    "the approach is to first understand the simpler but well understood cases where a minimal resolution can be supported on a simplicial complex , in particular the scarf complex .",
    "we then show how theorems of this type can be generalized to non simplicial complexes .",
    "first we must introduce some semantics and notation .",
    "due to the formulas for multigraded betti numbers in terms of order complexes of intervals in the lcm lattice(see theorem 2.1 in @xcite ) , we can refer to the betti numbers of a finite atomic lattice as opposed to the betti numbers of a monomial ideal .",
    "specifically for @xmath299 the formula for computing multigraded betti numbers in homological degree @xmath168 is : @xmath300 where @xmath3 is a monomial ideal whose lcm lattice is @xmath0 , and @xmath301 is the order complex of the open interval from @xmath13 to @xmath50 .",
    "note also that we can substitute the cross cut complex @xmath302 defined in section [ background ] for @xmath303 .",
    "since all monomial ideals with the same lcm lattice have isomorphic minimal resolutions this means that if a cell complex supports the minimal resolution of one ideal then it will support the minimal resolution for all possible coordinatizations of the lcm lattice of that ideal . in this sense",
    ", we will discuss the cellular resolution of a finite atomic lattice .",
    "notice that in a finite atomic lattice , any given element is not necessarily expressed as a unique join of atoms .",
    "for example the join of atoms 1 and 2 may be equal to the join of atoms 1 , 2 , and 3 . to account for this ambiguity",
    "it will be useful for us to introduce the following set associated to every element in the lattice , define @xmath304 to be the set containing all subsets of the atoms whose join in @xmath0 is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "it is now easy to define the scarf complex of a monomial ideal @xmath6 in terms of the lattice @xmath0 , @xmath305 note that because @xmath0 is an atomic lattice @xmath306 is the taylor complex associated to @xmath0 .    by results of @xcite and",
    "@xcite if a given monomial ideal is generic or strongly generic then its minimal resolution is the scarf complex .",
    "a strongly generic monomial ideal is one where no variable appears with the same exponent in two or more generators",
    ". the weaker condition of being generic implies that if two generators have the same exponent in a variable that there is a third generator which strictly divides their lcm .",
    "note however , that there may be monomial ideals whose minimal resolution is the scarf complex , yet the ideal is not generic .",
    "an obvious example of this phenomenon is if one takes a generic monomial ideal and polarizes to obtain a squarefree monomial ideal .",
    "it will have the same scarf complex which supports the minimal resolution since lcm lattices are preserved under polarization .",
    "it is rare however , for squarefree monomial ideals to be generic since all variables always appear with the same exponent .",
    "however there exist examples which are not simply a polarization of a generic monomial ideal , whose minimal resolution is supported by the scarf complex , but they are not generic or strongly generic .",
    "the following example of an abstract monomial ideal illustrates well an example of a monomial ideal whose minimal resolution is scarf , but where there is no possible generic coordinatization .",
    "[ scarfnotgeneric ] the lattice @xmath0 in figure [ scarfnotgen ] is the _ augmented face lattice _",
    "( face poset , which in this case is a meet - semilattice , plus a maximal element ) of a simplicial complex consisting of @xmath307 vertices and @xmath308 edges .",
    "every point in @xmath0 except for the minimal and maximal elements represents a multidegree that has a nonzero betti number .",
    "this is easy to see since for all of the atoms @xmath309 and for each element @xmath50 covering an atom @xmath310 consists of two vertices thus @xmath311 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 will always be resolved by its scarf complex .",
    "note however , that every possible coordinatization of @xmath0 fails to satisfy the conditions to be generic .",
    "in other words , that for every coordinatization a variable appears with the same non - zero exponent in either @xmath312 and @xmath313 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 , or in @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "since the meet - irreducibles of @xmath0 are precisely @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath320 any coordinatization must cover these .",
    "i will focus on just showing that for all coordinatizations there is a variable appearing with the same non - zero exponent for the pair @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "note that the monomial @xmath312 is determined by the labelings found on @xmath321 and @xmath313 is determined by @xmath322 .",
    "moreover , @xmath323 and @xmath320 must be labeled and if @xmath324 happens to be non - trivially labeled it also appears in both of these sets .",
    "any variable appearing in the label on @xmath325 and @xmath320 can not appear anywhere else , thus it must appear with the same exponent in both @xmath312 and @xmath313 and no other generator divides the lcm associated to element @xmath326 by construction .",
    "so there is no generic coordinatization of @xmath0 .",
    "understanding when generic coordinatizations exist must be determined on a case by case basis . for strongly generic coordinatizations",
    "however , the following theorem characterizes precisely when they exist .      to show that such graded lattices have strongly generic coordinatizations , coordinatize @xmath0 using the eccv coordinatization .",
    "now , we just need to show that the resulting monomial ideal is strongly generic . in other words",
    "we need to show that for any variable @xmath191 , if it appears in any two monomials @xmath327 and @xmath328 that it has a different exponent . by the definition of the monomials @xmath327 and @xmath328 this",
    "amounts to showing that the intersections of the complements of the filters @xmath329 and @xmath330 with the chain corresponding to @xmath191 are different .",
    "let @xmath331 be the chain which is entirely labeled by the variable @xmath191 .",
    "since @xmath0 is graded of rank @xmath2 we know that there are @xmath332 elements in @xmath193 and that the @xmath168-th element in the chain is the join of @xmath333 atoms of @xmath0 .",
    "every set @xmath329 intersects @xmath193 at a different spot along the chain , so it is likewise with the complements of these filters .",
    "this guarantees that each variable @xmath191 appears with a different exponent in each monomial generator .",
    "conversely suppose @xmath334 is a strongly generic monomial ideal . we need to show that its lcm lattice is graded and that the chains have rank n.",
    "since @xmath3 is strongly generic then we know that each variable @xmath65 must achieve its maximum degree @xmath335 for exactly one monomial generator @xmath336 .",
    "let @xmath337 i.e. omitting generator @xmath338 .",
    "then we know that the degree of @xmath65 in the monomial @xmath50 must be less than @xmath335 .",
    "thus @xmath339 in @xmath340 but @xmath341 where @xmath342 is the atom corresponding to the @xmath338th generator , so we can conclude that @xmath50 is covered by @xmath12 and thus is a coatom .",
    "now , consider @xmath343 .",
    "this will be @xmath344 where @xmath345 which is also a strongly generic monomial ideal . repeating the above argument for perhaps a different variable appearing in the generators of @xmath346 we can find a @xmath347 such that the maximal element of @xmath344 covers it",
    ", i.e. @xmath50 covers @xmath347 . iterating this process",
    "we can find precisely @xmath2 monomial ideals @xmath348 so that @xmath349 and the maximal element in @xmath350 corresponds to a coatom of @xmath348 .",
    "this produces a chain of length @xmath332 connecting @xmath12 to @xmath13 in @xmath340 and varying over all choices at each iteration we get all chains of @xmath340 .",
    "the following statement appeared as a proposition 5.14 in @xcite and separately as a theorem 5.3 in @xcite .",
    "an idea of how to prove this can be summarized as taking the face poset of the simplicial complex , making it a lattice by adding a maximal element ( if necessary ) , and then coordinatizing the lattice .",
    "[ phanscarf ] every simplicial complex @xmath255 not equal to the boundary of a simplex is the scarf complex of some squarefree monomial ideal .",
    "if @xmath255 is acyclic then @xmath255 supports the minimal resolution of that ideal .",
    "the intention of the next proposition is to demonstrate that each strata in @xmath1 with fixed total betti numbers has entire regions of lattices whose minimal resolution is the supported by the appropriate scarf complex .",
    "[ simplicialfilter ] suppose @xmath0 is minimally resolved by its scarf complex .",
    "if @xmath9 is such that @xmath351 in @xmath1 and the total betti numbers of @xmath9 are the same as the total betti numbers for @xmath0 , then @xmath9 is also resolved by its scarf complex which will equal the scarf complex of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is minimally resolved by its scarf complex , then @xmath352 implies that @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
    "so we need to show the same is true for the appropriate elements @xmath188 .",
    "since @xmath351 there is a join preserving map @xmath355 and recall that @xmath356 since any @xmath357 contributing to a betti number satisfies @xmath354 we see that there must be only one @xmath358 .",
    "it remains to show that for this @xmath359 we have @xmath360 .    to see this last fact ,",
    "consider the fact that since @xmath0 is resolved by its scarf complex we can inductively apply the above argument to every single face of @xmath310 to see that @xmath361 is precisely the same simplicial complex .",

    "no other elements of @xmath9 have nonzero betti numbers since @xmath9 is assumed to be in the same strata of total betti numbers as p. thus , @xmath362 and both are minimally resolved by their scarf complexes .",
    "we can also begin to generalize the previous results to account for ideals whose minimal resolutions will not be supported on a simplicial complex . then the following propositions provide a generalization of proposition [ phanscarf ] and proposition [ simplicialfilter ] .",
    "[ generalizationscarf ] let @xmath255 be a regular cell complex such that @xmath255 is acyclic , and the augmented face poset @xmath363 of @xmath255 is a finite atomic lattice on @xmath364 atoms ( i.e. the face poset is a meet - semilattice with @xmath2 atoms ) .",
