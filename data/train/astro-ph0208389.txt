    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with a neutron star primary can be observationally divided into two main categories , namely atolls and z sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "this classification is based on changes in both spectral and timing properties as the source varies , and probably reflects differences in both mass accretion rate , @xmath0 , and magnetic field , @xmath1 .",
    "the z sources have high luminosity ( typically more than 50 per cent of the eddington limit ) and magnetic field ( @xmath2 g ) while the atolls have lower luminosity ( generally less than 10 per cent of eddington ) and low magnetic field ( @xmath3 g ) ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .    both atolls and",
    "z - sources show spectral changes which form a well defined track in a colour - colour diagram .",
    "the atolls show hard , power - law spectra at low luminosities ( island state ) , which are startlingly like the low / hard spectra of galactic black hole binaries ( e.g. barret & vedrenne 1993 ; van paradijs & van der klis 1994 ; barret et al .",
    "2000 ) . at higher luminosities",
    "the spectra are typically much softer ( banana state ; e.g.  di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ; piraino , santangelo & kaaret 2000 ) . the z sources always show soft spectra , but there are subtle spectral changes which show up as a z - shaped track on a colour - colour diagram",
    ". both types of sources move _ along _ their tracks on the colour - colour diagram on time - scale of hours to days , except the island state of atolls , where motion can take days or weeks .",
    "they do not jump between the track branches .",
    "most of the x - ray spectral and timing parameters depend only on the position of a source in this diagram .",
    "this is usually parameterized by the curve length , @xmath4 , along the track .",
    "until recently the atolls were thought to show a characteristic c- ( or atoll ) shaped track on the colour - colour diagram .",
    "however , mapping the full range of colour - colour changes for these lmxbs is difficult because the data available from most of the sources show little variability .",
    "there are only a few transient lmxbs with enough observations covering wide range of luminosities , to follow the whole track traced out in the colour - colour diagram . in these transient systems",
    "the c - shaped path is only a subset of a larger track . at low luminosities , evolution _ within _ the island state forms an upper branch , turning the c into a z ( gierliski & done 2002 ; muno , remillard & chakrabarty 2002 ) .    while the colour - colour diagram is clearly useful as a way of parameterizing the spectral changes , true spectral fitting gives much more information on the underlying physical changes in the source emission .",
    "here we look at the detailed spectral shape of the transient atoll 4u 160852 as a function of its position on the colour - colour diagram , and show for the first time that _ all _ the spectra can be fit with a model in which a comptonized boundary layer around the neutron star illuminates the accretion disc , giving rise to a relativistically smeared ( and often highly ionized ) reflected component and iron line .",
    "we show that the spectral changes mapped by the colour - colour diagram are consistent with a picture in which increasing average mass accretion rate increases the optical depth of the boundary layer and decreases the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "4u 160852 is one of the transient neutron star lmxbs , with outbursts triggered by the disc instability which reoccur on time scales of @xmath5 days to 2 years ( lochner & roussel - dupr 1994 ) .",
    "however , little is known about the system as the optical counterpart is very faint ( grindlay & liller 1978 ; wachter 1997 ) .",
    "the distance is likewise poorly known .",
    "the current best estimate of 3.6 kpc is from observations of flux saturated ( radius expansion , eddington limited ) type i x - ray bursts ( e.g. nakamura et al .",
    "the inclination is constrained only by the fact that there are no eclipses in the x - ray light curve .",
    "the neutron star spin may be indicated by the recently detected burst oscillation in _ rxte _ at 620 hz ( muno at al .",
    "2001 )    hasinger and van der klis ( 1989 ) classified 4u 160852 as an atoll source from its spectral and timing properties .",
    "mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1989 ) observed with _",
    "tenma _ a continuous spectral transition from the banana high - luminosity , soft thermal spectrum to the island state with its low - intensity , hard power - law spectrum .",
    "they successfully fit these spectra by a two - component model consisting of the multicolour blackbody from the accretion disc and the comptonized blackbody from the boundary layer .",
    "higher energy observations with batse show that the island state power law is cut - off above @xmath6 100 kev ( zhang et al .",
    "an iron fluorescence line is detected in the _ tenma _ x - ray spectra ( suzuki at al .",
    "1984 ) with intensity weakly correlated with the source flux ( hirano et al .   1987 ) .",
    "_ ginga _ observations showed spectra in varying stages between the island and banana states , where the iron line ( modelled including the compton reflected component ) increased as the spectrum softened and the source moved towards the banana branch ( yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the power density spectrum of 4u 160852 in the island state resembles that of the black holes in the hard state ( yoshida et al .",
    "it is characterized by a flat top noise ( @xmath7 , with the slope @xmath8 ) below and a turn - over above a certain frequency , @xmath9 0.21 hz .",
    "there is also a low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) around 29 hz .",
    "_ rxte _ has seen a similar spectrum , where the high - frequency noise can be represented by the exponentially cut - off power law ( yu et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the banana state",
    "the power spectrum consists of very low - frequency noise below @xmath6 1 hz ( power law with @xmath10 ) , and an exponentially cut - off power law at higher frequencies ( mndez et al .",
    "1999 ) .",

    "a third kilohertz qpo has also been detected ( jonker , mndez & van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "the khz qpos are only found in a limited range of the colour - colour diagram , near the transition between the island and banana states ( mndez et al .",
    "we have analyzed _ rxte _ observations from the 1998 february  april outburst ( archival numbers p30062 , p30188 , and p30502 ) and from low - luminosity observations in 1996 december ( p10094 ) and 1998 june , august and september ( p30419 ) .",
    "all these data belong to the proportional counter array ( pca ) gain epoch 3 . a conservative prescription to characterise uncertainties in the instrument response",
    "is to add 2 per cent systematics to the data for bright sources ( e.g.  cui et al .",
    "1997 ) , irrespective of which detector / layer combination and gain epoch are used .",
    "however , inspection of data from the crab shows that in epoch 3 , when using _ only _ top layer data from detectors 0 and 1 , smaller systematics of 0.5 per cent are more appropriate ( wilson & done 2001 ) .",
    "we have repeated this crab analysis , and found that even using a single absorbed ( fixed at @xmath11 @xmath12 ; massaro et al .",
    "2000 ) power law gives a reduced @xmath13 with 0.5 per cent systematic errors .",
    "this clearly shows that there are no residuals in the response ( e.g.  features from the xenon edge at 4.7 kev , or from the rapid decrease in effective area at low energies ) of the top layer of detectors 0 and 1 at this level at this time .",
    "this is _ not _ the case for all layers and all detectors , where the reduced @xmath14 with 0.5 per cent systematic errors and there is a clear feature in the residuals at low energies .",
    "thus we use _ only _ data from epoch 3 , and from the top layer of detectors 0 and 1 , and apply 0.5 per cent systematic errors .",
    "however , we have checked that our conclusions are robust even to using 1 per cent systematics , although this gives unrealistically low @xmath15 values .",
    "first , we created pca light - curves for each energy channel in 128 s time bins .",
    "we excluded all the data affected by the type i bursts .",
    "this gave us 240 ks of pca data .",
    "the light - curves were used to build a colour - colour diagram , defining a soft colour as a ratio of 46.4 to 34 kev count rates , and a hard colour as a 9.716 over 6.49.7 kev ratio .",
    "these count rates are corrected for the slow variations in the pca response ( van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ; see gierliski & done 2002 for technical details applied here ) . the diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] .    next , we extracted the pca and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) spectra corresponding to different positions in the colour - colour diagram .",
    "we have assumed that 4u 160852 shows a z - shaped track on the diagram , with inferred accretion rate increasing along the z : from left to right on the upper branch , through the diagonal to the lower branch ( gierliski & done 2002 ; muno et al .",
    "the diagonal branch is sparsely covered in this data selection .",
    "we divided the diagram into eight regions ( boxes ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] , and averaged the spectra over each box .",
    "neutron star lmxbs are known to vary in luminosity at given colours , creating the so - called parallel lines in colour - intensity diagrams ( e.g.  van der klis 2001 ) . therefore , within one box we average spectra of different intensities . though not necessary identical , these spectra should be very similar , considering nearness of colours . in the classic terminology of",
    "the atoll sources boxes 13 belong to the island state , boxes 58 to the banana , while the status of the box 4 can not be established without joint spectral and timing analysis . to avoid accumulating spectral data from periods distant in time",
    ", we have created spectra 1 and 2 from 1996 data only ( slanted crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] ) , and spectra 38 from 1998 data only ( filled squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] ) .",
    "the pca spectra are accompanied by the simultaneous hexte spectra extracted from cluster 0 .",
    "we will refer to these joint spectra as s1s8 .",
    "for spectral fitting we use the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec version 11 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the error of each model parameter is given for a 90 per cent confidence interval .",
    "we use the 320 kev pca data and 20150 kev hexte data .",
    "the relative normalization of the pca and hexte instruments is still uncertain , so we allow this to be an additional free parameter in all spectral fits .",
    "unlike black holes , the accreting neutron stars have both a surface and a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , their x - ray spectra are expected to be more complex than these of the black holes . as well as emission from the accretion flow ( direct emission from an optically thick , x - ray illuminated disc and/or an optically thin inner flow , corona or active regions ; e.g.  czerny , czerny & grindlay 1986 ; esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; beloborodov 1999 ) there can be emission from the neutron star surface and the boundary layer ( e.g.  popham & sunyaev 2001 ) .",
    "observationally , the x - ray spectra of lmxbs in the soft state are well known to require at least two different spectral components , but the interpretation of these is not unique . the so - called _ eastern _ model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 , 1989 ) assumes that the soft component is from the disc , while the hard component is due to comptonization in the boundary layer or the inner disc . in the _ western _ model ( white , stella & parmar 1988 )",
    "the soft component is a single - temperature blackbody from the surface , while the hard component is a comptonized emission from the disc .",
    "while it is likely that both disc and boundary layer are comptonized at some level , it seems more probable that the boundary layer should have a higher temperature than the accretion disc ( popham & sunyaev 2001 ) .",
    "the hard state x - ray spectra of lmxbs are similar to those of the black hole candidates in their low / hard spectral state .",
    "they are dominated by a power law , with some contribution from an additional soft thermal component .",
    "the power law is usually interpreted as comptonization of seed photons in hot , optically thin plasma ( see e.g.  barret et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "thus , a physically motivated model which can potentially fit the hard component in _ all _ spectral states is thermal comptonization .",
    "an optically thin , hot plasma would produce a power - law spectrum ( island state ) , while a plasma with intermediate or high optical depth and lower temperature can create a softer spectrum in which the high energy rollover due to the electron temperature can be seen ( banana state ) .",
    "we model the comptonized spectrum using an approximate solution of kompaneets ( 1956 ) equation ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ) .",
    "the model ( hereafter thcomp , not included in the standard distribution of xspec ) is parameterized by the plasma electron temperature , @xmath16 and optical depth @xmath17 ( or equivalently the asymptotic spectral index ) , and blackbody seed photon temperature , @xmath18 .",
    "the seed photon energy is very important in the comptonization model , since it gives a low - energy cut - off in the spectrum . for typical mass accretion rates onto a neutron star",
    "the seed photons from either the inner accretion disc or neutron star surface should have @xmath19 kev .",
    "this is plainly not far from the observed x - ray bandpass , so simple analytic approximations ( e.g. the compst model or a cut - off power law ) for the compton scattered spectrum are _ not _ valid , since they extend towards lower energies as a uncut power law ( see e.g. done , ycki & smith 2002 ) .",
    "the model thcomp we use in this paper treats the seed photons low - energy cut - off properly .",
    "the boundary layer should illuminate the inner disc , producing a relativistically broadened iron line and associated reflected continuum .",
    "while a broad iron line is often identified in atoll spectra , the reflected continuum which _ must _ accompany any line emission has only been fit to island state spectra .",
    "we calculate the compton reflection of the thcomp continuum spectrum using a model where both the continuum reflection and the line are calculated self - consistently for a given ionization state ( ycki , done & smith 1998 ) .",
    "the reflected spectrum ( continuum and line ) is also relativistically smeared for a given inner disc radius , @xmath20 .",
    "we approximate relativistic smearing by convolving the reflected spectrum with a relativistic line profile ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "first we demonstrate explicitly the need for a two component continuum in _ all _ the data sets",
    ". the thcomp continuum model and its reflection alone can not give satisfactory fits for the spectra s1s5 , where @xmath21 at 80 or 79 degrees of freedom .",
    "there is a strong soft excess in the residuals below @xmath6 5 kev , which is particularly marked in s1 and s5 where @xmath22 .",
    "we use a multicolour disc blackbody ( diskbb in xspec ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) , to describe the soft component .",
    "this model is parameterized by the disc temperature , @xmath23 , at the inner disc radius ( @xmath20 ) and normalization @xmath24 .",
    "however , its shape is poorly constrained by the _",
    "data so it can equally well be a single - temperature blackbody .",
    "the spectra s6s8 give good fits without the soft component ( @xmath15 = 80 , 88 and 75 at 78 d.o.f .",
    ", for s6 , s7 and s8 , respectively ) , though even here inclusion of diskbb improves the fits significantly . the soft component in the case of the weakest improvement ( for s6 where @xmath25 ) is statistically significant at 99.7 per cent level .",
    "the compton reflection ( including the self - consistent iron line emission ) is always significantly detected also .",
    "using the two component continuum model ( diskbb+thcomp ) without a reflected component gives an increase in @xmath15 by more than 50 in all spectra ( corresponding to an extremely high significance level ) .",
    "these results motivate us to choose a model consisting of thermal comptonization , its compton reflection and the disc blackbody as the model with which to fit _ all _ the spectra .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for spectral fitting we use the model described in the previous section .",

    "1989 ) . in the island state spectra ,",
    "s1-s3 , the hexte statistics at higher energies are not good enough to constrain the electron temperature of the comptonized component , @xmath16 . the high energy cutoff begins to be seen in s4 and s5 , although again the uncertainties on @xmath16 are large .",
    "all of these spectra provide only lower temperature limits .",
    "therefore , we fit the spectra s1s5 with @xmath27 fixed at 50 kev , a value consistent with all these data sets , and then calculate the lower limits on the electron temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra s6s8 are able to constrain the electron temperature well .",
    "the data can not constrain the inner disc radius from relativistic smearing of the reflected component .",
    "spectral fitting gives only lower limits on @xmath20 , which are typically 1020@xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) except for spectra s4 and s5 which are consistent with @xmath30 .",

    "we calculate the unabsorbed bolometric flux , @xmath32 , from the model .",
    "we can not precisely estimate its uncertainties as this depends on the model used as well as on the statistics .",
    "however , fits with different soft component model ( disc or blackbody ) show consistently similar results , with the same trend : an increase from s1 to s3 , a drop at s4 and a further increase from s5 to s8 .",
    "this supports the inferred direction of the increasing accretion rate on the colour - colour diagram , tracing out a z - shaped track ( see also gierliski & done 2002 ) .    with increasing inferred accretion rate",
    "the spectra become brighter , softer , and have a decreasing electron temperature as seen from the high energy cutoff .",
    "the change in the spectral shape between the island and banana states is clearly visible .",
    "spectrum s4 bears more similarities to the banana state spectra than to island state , so it likely belongs to the banana state .",

    "the lower seed photon temperature derived for the island state means the low energy cutoff is less pronounced ( not significantly detected ) in spectra s1-s3 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the electron temperature of the hard comptonized component is consistent with a monotonic decline along the colour - colour track , while the optical depth is consistent with a corresponding monotonic increase .",
    "these two parameters are difficult to disentangle in data in which the high - energy rollover ( at a few @xmath27 ) is not observed , as in the island state spectra . however , while the optical depth derived for a given temperature also depends on the assumed geometry , it is clear that the island state spectra have @xmath17 of order unity , while the banana branch has @xmath34 .",
    "we derive similar optical depths and temperatures when we replace the approximate thcomp thermal comptonization model with compps comptonization code ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) , which finds a numerical solution of the comptonization problem explicitly considering successive scattering orders .",
    "reflection ( mostly driven by the detection of the self consistently produced iron line ) is always significantly detected , although the inferred solid angle subtended by the reflecting material is generally rather low , with @xmath35 .",
    "the spectrum s4 has somewhat more reflection but this is not strongly statistically significant .",
    "reflection is always strongly ionized , with ionization increasing in the higher luminosity banana spectra .",
    "the presence of reflection in all spectra ( both in island and banana states ) demonstrates that the broad , ionized iron line seen from these sources can indeed be produced by illumination of the accretion disc .",
    "the rather small reflected fraction in the island state is in conflict with @xmath36 0.51 found in 220 kev _ ginga _ x - ray spectra of 4u 160852 by yoshida et al .",

    "does not _ give rise to a power law at energies close to the seed photon energies , and the data also require a soft component as well as the comptonized emission .",
    "our results are consistent ( although with large uncertainties ) with a reflection - spectral shape correlation for spectra s1-s4 , as claimed by zdziarski et al .",

    "we fit the spectra of the atoll 4u 1608 - 52 at all points along its track on the colour - colour diagram by a physically motivated model , consisting of thermal comptonization and its compton reflection , together with a soft component . both reflection ( with the self consistently calculated iron line emission ) and the soft component",
    "are always statistically significantly detected in the spectra .",
    "there is a dramatic change in spectral shape between the island and banana states , probably caused by an equally dramatic change in the accretion flow geometry . in the island state",
    "the observed soft component luminosity and temperature implies an emission region which is smaller than an accretion disc around a neutron star .",
    "we suggest it arises from optically thick , thermal emission from surface of the neutron star .",
    "the hard component is consistent with comptonization of these observed soft photons from the neutron star surface by hot electrons in an inner optically thin accretion flow ( or outer boundary layer ) .",
    "the optically thin comptonizing medium has temperature of @xmath60 20 kev .",
    "we do not see direct emission from the accretion disc in the pca energy range , but we do see weak reflected emission implying that the disc subtends a solid angle @xmath61 from the point of view of the hard x - ray source .    in the banana branch spectra the comptonized component is much softer , with temperature of @xmath6 5 kev and optical depth of @xmath62 .",
    "here the observed soft component _ is _ consistent with being from the disc , but the seed photons are _ not _ consistent with being the observed soft component , and again it is more likely that the seed photons are produced predominantly by the neutron star surface .",
    "this interpretation favours the eastern model of lmxbs on the banana branch .",
    "a scenario consistent with all of the above results is one in which the main parameter driving the spectral evolution is the average mass accretion rate , which determines the truncation radius of the inner accretion disc . at low mass accretion rates",
    "the optically thick disc does not extend down to the neutron star surface , and the inner accretion flow / boundary layer is mostly optically thin .",
    "the large radius of the optically thick disc means that its temperature and luminosity is low so it can not be seen directly in the pca spectra , and it subtends a rather small solid angle for reflection .",
    "since the accretion flow is not very optically thick then some fraction @xmath63 of the emission from the neutron star surface can be seen directly , while the rest is comptonized into the hard component .",
    "as the mass accretion rate increases , so the disc extends further in and the optical depth of the inner flow / boundary layer increases . eventually the neutron star surface is shrouded by the increasingly optically thick flow , so that these seed photons can not be seen .",
    "the high optical depth also means that the boundary layer emission is then close to thermalizing , so its temperature drops , while the decreasing inner radius of the disc means that its emission starts to become more important in the pca bandpass .    in this scenario",
    "the island state / banana branch transition is marked by the point at which the inner accretion flow collapses into a disc .",
    "the disc extends further in so that it is observed more easily as a soft component , softening the soft colour .",
    "but it also means that the boundary layer becomes much more optically thick , so its temperature drops , softening the hard colour .",
    "it is plain that this can explain _ qualitatively _ the atoll source evolution .",
    "we will investigate the _ quantitative _ implications of this in a later paper .",
