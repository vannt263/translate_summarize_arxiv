    "an interesting property of such description is a possibility that the variance acquires a finite value even if the underlying process is assumed as a non - gaussian lvy stable process , defined by the stability index @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the covariance functions are finite as well .",
    "the autocorrelation function for the generalised ornstein- uhlenbeck process @xmath2 , defined by the langevin equation driven by a multiplicative cauchy noise , falls with time like a stretched exponential but may be reasonable approximated by a simple exponential @xcite .",
    "then the process @xmath2 comprises two features : it exhibits long jumps and possesses well - defined covariance functions .",
    "when such a process enters a stochastic equation as a random driving , the finite correlation time requires a usual damping term to be substituted by a retarded friction to ensure a proper equilibrium state .",
    "this problem is well - known for the gaussian processes : one can construct an effective low - dimensional equation describing a many - body system in which individual variables are coupled by harmonic oscillators @xcite .",

    "moreover , the effective random force is gaussially distributed .",
    "if velocities of bath particles are non - gaussian but of finite variance , one may still expect convergence to the gaussian , according to the central limit theorem .",
    "however , this theorem does not apply in the presence of long range correlations , which is natural in complex systems . on the other hand ,",
    "large higher moments make convergence to the gaussian impossible even if independent variables are linearly combined . in particular",
    ", the distance of that distribution from the gaussian is infinite when the third moment diverges , according to the berry - essen theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effective noise may be non - gaussian and the dynamics of such systems may still be described by gle @xcite .",
    "gle driven by @xmath2 for the case without a deterministic force was analysed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the probability density distributions converge with time to a stationary state with a power - law tail ; the variance grows linearly with time indicating a normal diffusion .    in this paper",
    ", we consider gle driven by @xmath2 for the case of a bistable system and activated , in addition , by a periodic force .",
    "we address a physically important problem of the time characteristics of the barrier penetration and analyse the influence of the memory on this process .",
    "we calculate , in particular , the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) as a function of model parameters . when the rate of the jumping between the potential wells due to the noise coincides with the frequency of the oscillatory force , the stochastic resonance ( sr ) is observed .",
    "we discuss this phenomenon and demonstrate how model parameters modify its properties , in particular the position and intensity .",
    "the ordinary ornstein - uhlenbeck process describes motion of the particle subjected to a linear deterministic force and an additive gaussian white noise .",
    "it can be generalised by admitting a dependence of the noise on the process value ( a multiplicative noise ) and including non - gaussian distributions , in particular the lvy stable distributions with power - law tails .",
    "then the generalised process obeys the following langevin equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the noise and a given function @xmath5 may be responsible e.g. for a nonhomogeneous structure of the environment . since @xmath4 is a white noise , eq.([la ] )",

    "otherwise , a numerical evaluation of the double integral ( [ defc ] ) reveals a stretched exponential shape at large time @xcite .",
    "however , a deviation of @xmath22 from the simple exponential is very small and the dependence of the rate on both system parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , appears simple .",
