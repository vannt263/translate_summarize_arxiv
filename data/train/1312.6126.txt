    "the giant hot jupiter hd 209458b was the first extrasolar planet observed in transit @xcite and the first for which far - ultraviolet space observations were obtained with the _ _ hubble space telescope/__space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument .",
    "+ an initial analysis of this data set was performed by @xcite ( 2003 , hereafter vm03 ) .",
    "these authors carried out observations in the ly@xmath0 line ( at 1215.67  ) , measuring an extra mid - transit absorption ( relative to the level of the continuum ) of @xmath10 per cent over a range of [ -130,200 ] km s@xmath2 . also , the spectral absorption during transit was deeper on the blue side of the stellar line .",
    "these results lead the authors to claim the existence of an extended exosphere ( as predicted in @xcite ) .",
    "later , a new analysis of the same data set was performed by @xcite ( 2007 , 2008 , hereafter bj07 and bj08 , respectively ) to account for the effect of stellar variability on the transit depths . in these works ,",
    "the authors measured an absorption of @xmath11 per cent in the @xmath12 km s@xmath2 velocity range , which they explained as the effective absorption made by a cloud of @xmath13 ( which is smaller than the planetary roche lobe ) , implying no direct evidence for a cometary tail in the data .",
    "+ these differences in the measurement of the ly@xmath0 absorption led to a discussion in the literature ( see bj07 ; bj08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "bj07 developed a new correction for the geocoronal contamination that led him to redefine the wavelength limits used for calculating the transit depth .",
    "unlike bj07 , in @xcite ( 2008 , hereafter vm08 ) the authors argued that the discrepancies were mainly due to the use of different wavelength ( or velocity ) ranges to convert the spectra , as a function of time , into a single absorption depth , and to the reference flux used to correct the intrinsic stellar flux variation .",
    "hence , they claimed that larger wavelength domains imply a diluted absorption signal with a consequently lower absorption depth .",
    "@xcite argued that the apparent disagreement between bj07 and vm03 arises not only from different definitions of the transit depth but also from differences in the treatment of the data .",
    "however , they agreed with vm08 that , as the core of the absorption line is optically thick up to the roche lobe , the atmosphere must be evaporating . +",
    "another issue related to the transit absorption of ly@xmath0 photons in the velocity range of [ -130,100 ] km s@xmath2 , is the origin of the high - velocity neutral gas . to answer this question , and arguing that the stellar radiation pressure is not enough to explain the observations",
    ", @xcite proposed that the high - velocity neutral hydrogen can be produced by charge exchange between the neutral atmosphere and the stellar wind ions .",
    "the stellar wind velocity they used was somehow low ( @xmath14 km s@xmath2 ) in comparison to the typical solar wind conditions .",
    "following this idea , and employing a more typical stellar wind velocity ( @xmath15 km s@xmath2 ) , @xcite modelled the production of neutral hydrogen and matched the signature of the ly@xmath0 absorption profile . + also , other atmosphere mass - loss models due to euv input from host stars can also account for the ly@xmath0 absorption and the high - velocity neutral gas ( see vm03 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ the proximity of the planet to its parent star ( @xmath16 au ) and the consequent non - thermal heating of the upper planetary atmosphere ( up to @xmath17k ) by stellar x - ray and euv photons , would produce a hydrodynamic blow - off of the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "@xcite showed that this mechanism may be enhanced by tidal forces that could pull the exobase level up to the roche limit , and predicted an asymmetric shape for the transit curve due to the comet - like tail produced by the evaporating atmosphere of the planet .",
    "this scenario was reinforced by the detection of hydrodynamic escape signals in c ii and o i lines ( vm08 ) , na i d lines @xcite and si iii line @xcite .",
    "though , according to @xcite the observations are not yet sufficient to establish the presence of a tail . + the question",
    "whether the stis observations are correctly explained as a planetary wind driven by photoionization or by charge exchange ( or both processes ) remains open .",
    "the works of @xcite and @xcite showed that either energetic neutral hi of stellar origin or thermal hi populations in the planetary atmosphere could fit the ly@xmath0 observations . @xcite introduced a generic method to analyse and interpret ultraviolet transit light curves .",
    "they applied it to the measurements of hd 209458b , and showed that the observations can be explained by absorption in the upper atmosphere without the need of enas .",
    "almost all models that try to explain the observed ly@xmath0 absorption of hd209458b produce mass - loss rates that are several times @xmath18 g s@xmath2 .",
    "for example , @xcite ( 2004 , see correction in @xcite ) , find @xmath19 g s@xmath2 , @xcite find @xmath20 g s@xmath2 , @xcite finds @xmath21 g s@xmath2 , @xcite finds @xmath22 g s@xmath2 , and @xcite find @xmath23 g s@xmath2 .",
    "+ we need to keep in mind that the presence of a planetary magnetic field can lead to significant changes in the upper atmosphere of planets and consequently can lower the planetary mass - loss rate .",
    "@xcite , considering an outflow modulated by a magnetic field , estimated a planetary outflow of the order of @xmath24 g s@xmath2 produced mainly in the polar regions . + in @xcite ( 2007 , hereafter sch07 ) a model for the cometary exosphere around hd 209458b",
    "was presented via the assumption that it is dynamically similar to the ion tail of a comet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "3d hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between the material , which is being photoevaporated from the planetary atmosphere , and the impinging stellar wind lead to the conclusion that a cometary structure , obtained as a consequence of the simulated wind interaction , must have a size that grows for increasing values of the planetary mass - loss rate @xmath25 , and therefore produces a ly@xmath0 absorption of the stellar emission which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath25 . in this model , a fixed solar - like value for the stellar wind speed and an isotropic emission were assumed . from the comparison with the observations of vm03 for the ly@xmath0 absorption , the authors estimated the mass - loss rate as @xmath26 g s@xmath2 .",
    "+ in this work , despite the mentioned discussions in literature ( not yet settled ) , and assuming the existence of an evaporating atmosphere , we study the influence of different stellar wind temperatures and velocities , on the planetary mass - loss rate . in spite of the oversimplifications of our model a variation of the stellar wind speed and temperature , in a reasonable range , gives different values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , different combinations of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the stellar wind speed at the planet position ) could give account of the absorption derived from the observations .",
    "we explore the allowed range of this combination of parameters and discuss its implication on the determined stellar - planetary parameters .",
    "the procedure consists of assuming values of @xmath7 within a range of possible ones .",
    "then , to constrain the planetary mass - loss rate the numerically derived ly@xmath0 absorption is compared with the observations .",
    "+ the first part of the study is performed assuming an isotropic planetary wind for a thermalized atmosphere . in the second part",
    ", we explore the effect of different structures of planetary wind emissions resembling different cases such as the day / night asymmetry due to a tidally locked planetary motion , and polar winds due to emission associated with reconnection processes ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this final part only presents toy atmospheric models which illustrate how more detailed escaping atmosphere models could modify the predicted ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "+ we describe our numerical approach in  [ method ] , the anisotropic planetary ejection wind models in  [ toy ] , and discuss the consequences of the results in  [ discussion ] .",

    "the coordinate system is such that the star is placed at the centre of the domain and the planet is orbiting in the @xmath44-plane .",
    "we define two inner boundaries , one that belongs to the planet , whose location is updated at each time step according to the orbital motion , forced to have the maximum resolution , and the other is located at a fixed radius from the center of the computational domain , where the stellar wind is imposed continuously .",

    "it is important to emphasize that we do not solve the problem of the production of a wind from the irradiated surface of the planet ( for works that handle the wind production see ; e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the density profile inside the inner boundary ( @xmath68 ) is slightly different to the one proposed in @xcite , since it has a slower increase towards the surface of the planet .",
    "this does not affect the calculated absorption , since the material within the roche lobe ( @xmath69 ) absorbs in the range cover by the @xmath70 geocoronal contamination .",
    "assuming an escaping planetary wind is a way of eliminating from our simulations the complex problem of the calculation of the photoevaporation of the planetary atmosphere .",

    "we consider that the planetary material temperature above its ionization value ( @xmath92k ) will not contribute to the absorption .",
    "the material from the planetary wind is identified with an advected passive scalar in the simulations .",

    ", @xmath111$]km s@xmath2 ) . to identify the absorption ranges we adopt the convention used in vm08 : line core interval ( c : [ 19 - 11 ] per cent ) measured by vm03 , intermediate line range ( i : [ 11 - 6.8 ] per cent ) measured by bj07 and whole line range ( w : [ 7 - 3 ] per cent ) measured by vm04 .",
    "the rotational periods of ` hot jupiters ' are likely synchronized with their orbital periods , hence only one side of the planet is irradiated . for this reason ,",
    "it is not a bad idea to relax the assumption of isotropic , and try to see how different structures of planetary winds affect the measured absorptions .",
    "also , going a little further in this line of thought , and based on the discussion in @xcite where the probable existent planetary magnetic field is simulated , we propose a scenario where the escaping material occurs in the polar regions . with this in mind we present four oversimplified alternative inner boundaries for the planet , that we named as follows    * _ day _ : escape only through the illuminated hemisphere .",
    "this is the case when the energy deposited in the day side can not be redistributed to the night side , as would happen when the horizontal advection time is longer than the radial advection time ( see discussion in @xcite ) . *",
    "_ day - night _ : 75 per cent of the mass escapes from the day side and 25 % from the night side .",
    "this happens because some of the energy deposited on the illuminated hemisphere is transported to the other hemisphere , but a variation remains @xcite .",
    "* _ night _ : escape only through the night side .",
    "a strong stellar wind may compress the atmosphere and inhibit its escape from the day hemisphere @xcite .",

    "in sch07 , typical solar wind conditions were employed to simulate the interaction with the escaping planetary atmosphere , and to compute the resulting absorption . the @xmath122 stellar wind velocity used in sch07 led to an @xmath123 estimate ( obtained by adjusting the computed absorption to the value of the absorption reported by vm04 ) .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to explore the effect of several wind speeds @xmath124 , at the orbital position and coronal temperatures @xmath125 on the inferred @xmath25 . for each model ,",

    "columns 4 - 6 show the maximum absorption values when excluding the part of the spectrum contaminated by the geocoronal ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "note that the calculated absorptions correspond only to the contribution of the tail ; the material close to the atmosphere has a radial speed of @xmath128 km s@xmath2 which falls within the subtracted speed range .",
    "when comparing among the models some general trends can be noted .",
    "larger absorption values are obtained when lowering the coronal temperature , and/or the stellar wind velocity , or by increasing the planetary mass - loss rate .",
    "this last trend is easily explained since as more planetary material is ejected a larger column density is obtained , and consequently a larger absorption can be expected .",
    "higher coronal temperatures produce an increase of the temperature gradient - between the stellar wind and the neutral planetary atmosphere ( @xmath129k ) - causing a larger heat transfer which increases the ionization rate , thus lowering the absorption .",
    "also , higher stellar wind speeds ( due to higher @xmath53 or lower @xmath37 values ) result in a consequent larger stellar ram pressures that hinders the expansion of the planetary wind , reducing the absorption and transit time .",
    "the dependence of the transit time on @xmath53 and @xmath28 obeys the same mechanisms as the absorption .",
    "that is , as an increase in @xmath130 is accompanied by an increase in both , the ionization rate and the stellar ram pressure , it produces changes in the size and structure of the escaping material .",
    "more specifically , a larger ram pressure produces a more radially aligned wake , and a more effective ionization leads to a smaller size of the absorbing tail , and hence to shorter transit times .    for @xmath116 and all @xmath131 the models with @xmath132 g s@xmath2 ( highlighted values in the lower panel of table [ tab2 ] ) are the ones that better adjust the observational values for the three spectral domains , i.e. , they fit the limits given by vm03 ( [ 19 - 11 ] per cent ) , bj07 ( [ 11 - 6.8 ] per cent ) and vm04 ( [ 7 - 3 ] per cent ) . whereas , for the models with @xmath127 larger @xmath25 are required ( highlighted in the upper panel of table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath127 implies a more efficient heat transfer , hence the resulting stellar wind velocity and temperature at the orbital position will be larger than for @xmath116 resulting in lower absorption values .",

    ", we see that models with @xmath127 emission slowly begin to reach saturation , whereas , as expected , signs of saturations are already met in the case with @xmath116 and stellar wind temperature ( @xmath156 mk ) , resulting in the intersection of some of the lines .",
    "this is the reason why , unlike the general trend mentioned earlier , we find an increase of the absorption with increasing coronal temperature .",
    "that is , the bottom panel of table [ tab2 ] shows that , when varying @xmath130 from @xmath134 to @xmath157 mk with @xmath158 g s@xmath2 the absorption values increase from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that all these results are valid considering a fix value of @xmath161 . in order to test the influence of @xmath161 in the calculated ly@xmath0 planetary absorption we run two cases where @xmath161 is @xmath162 and @xmath163 of its fixed value ( @xmath6  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "the other model parameters are : @xmath164 mk , @xmath155 and @xmath165 .",
    "we found that the planetary absorption increases almost a @xmath166 in the first case and diminishes by the same amount in the second case .",
    "this implies that the @xmath25 that better adjust the observational ly@xmath0 absorption values are @xmath167 and @xmath168 g s@xmath2 , respectively .          in section [ toy ]",
    "we introduced four anisotropic models inspired on the discussions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows the results obtained for the different planetary wind models ordered with decreasing absorption ( see columns 2 - 4 ) . from the results",
    ", we can see that the day and day - night anisotropic models produce less absorption and a shorter transit time than the isotropic one .",
    "plasma mostly evaporated from the illuminated side is rapidly ionized and thus absorption is less important than in the other escape models .",
    "the shortest transit time is produced when the planetary wind is emitted from the day - night model .",
    "the difference between this last model , with respect to the day one , is because there is less material to be ionized given the lower initial planetary speed value ( to allow the same @xmath25 ) .",
    "the largest absorptions and transit times occur for the polar and night models .",
    "as can bee seen in figure [ fig6 ] , where a 3d view shows the density distribution for the absorbing material , the day and day - night models exhibit smaller absorbing tails , and the longest belongs to the polar model .",
    "this latter model exhibits greater neutral density ( in comparison to the rest of the anisotropic models ) available to absorb within the tail , and can propagate further before being heated and consequently ionized .",
    "[ fig7](a ) shows the @xmath169 simulated normalized flux ( to the out of transit value for the c limits ) as a function of the wavelength for the same anisotropic models ( @xmath170 g s@xmath2 and t@xmath171 mk ) , together with the corresponding isotropic model .",
    "figs [ fig7](b ) and ( c ) show a zoom of the right- and left - hand wings of the absorption profile as a function of the wavelength for the previous mentioned cases .",
    "the evident blueshifted asymmetry in the line profiles is a consequence of the absorbing planetary material escaping towards the line - of - sight direction ( vm03 ) , being more pronounced in the polar and night cases , where the planetary mass - loss configuration favours the driving of absorbing material towards the line of sight .",
    "in this work , we have explored a wide range of parameters with the main purpose of studying the dynamic response of close - in exoplanets to different stellar wind conditions .",
    "the chosen system , hd 209458 is the most known among the many observed , and therefore has served as a good numerical laboratory .",
    "initially , our aim was to find a mechanism that would help to determine the stellar wind velocity at the orbital position , yet not defined for the present system due to the need of better observational data .",
    "nevertheless , from our results we have been able to narrow down some parameters . for a fixed @xmath172 , we found that the @xmath25 is not too sensitive to the stellar wind conditions , in comparison with the ranges reported in the literature .",
    "observation of transits have found mass - loss rates in the range @xmath173 g s@xmath2 ( see vm03 ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath25 values varying in a reasonable range ( @xmath174 [ 1 - 7 ] @xmath66 g s@xmath2 ) we could constrain the planetary mass - loss rate by comparing the observational ly@xmath0 absorption with the numerically derived values .",
    "the range we found for @xmath7 is @xmath51[3 - 5]@xmath175 g s@xmath2 , where it changes a factor of @xmath176 for a change in temperature from [ 3 - 7 ] @xmath177 k , a variation of the stellar wind velocity in the range @xmath178 $ ] km s@xmath2 , and a polytropic index value between @xmath150 $ ] .",
    "also , our models give a variation of the transit time between @xmath179$]h , which is in agreement with the minimum observed @xmath126 ( see fig .",
    "3 by vm03 where we can estimate a @xmath180 h ) .",
    "a better observational determination of @xmath126 could play an important role in solving part of the degeneracy in the inferred mass loss rate and stellar wind parameters .",
    "the ly@xmath0 planetary absorption depends on the @xmath161 value , thus assuming that a fix value of this parameter constraints the results .",
    "however , by studying a single model , we notice that while varying @xmath161 through a factor of @xmath162 and @xmath163 the @xmath181 that better adjusts the observational ly@xmath0 absorption value changes in a factor of @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "another important result comes from studying the variation of the structure of the escaping atmosphere .",
    "even though the present models are far from being realistic , they give us a hint on how to further study these type of systems .",
    "still , we can conclude that there is a noticeable effect produced by changes in the escaping atmosphere on the observed ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the polar and night side emitting models , show an enhanced absorption with respect to the isotropic and there is an appreciable reduction on the maximum absorption measured for the day and day - night cases , where the day - night model shows the minor value .",
    "note that for all isotropic and anisotropic models the velocity of the planetary escaping material ranges from @xmath184 $ ] km s@xmath2 , in accordance with the observational data .",
    "more realistic models are necessary , specially if we want to venture on this last part . for instance",
    ", an improved model should include explicitly the photoionization of the planetary wind in the hydrodynamical calculation , even though , this is unlikely to produce an important effect on the ly@xmath45 absorption , because as the tail expands it becomes optically thin .",
    "also , a similar study to the present one should be done with the inclusion of the systems magnetic fields , i.e. the almost certain planetary magnetic field and the stellar magnetic field is another ."
