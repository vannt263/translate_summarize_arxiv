    "the gamma - ray pulsar geminga ( psr  j0633@xmath31746 , 1e  0630@xmath3178 , 1cg  195@xmath304 ) was first identified as a compact gamma - ray source in the galactic anticenter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . though initial speculation included the possibility that this source was a pulsar , its identification as such was not secure until the detection of x - ray pulsations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since pulsars are typically bright in the radio portion of the spectrum , intense effort has been devoted to finding a radio counterpart to geminga ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",

    "however , subsequent attempts to detect pulsed emission at frequencies of  35 and  326  mhz have failed ( ramachandran , deshpande , & indrani  1998 ; @xcite ) . in an effort to constrain further the radio spectrum of geminga , we have conducted 74 and 326  mhz observations of it . in  [ sec : observe ] we describe our observations , in  [ sec : scintillate ] we obtain upper limits for the geminga pulsar that take interstellar scintillation into account , and in  [ sec : conclude ] we discuss our results .",
    "reported previous detections of geminga have been in the range 41103  mhz ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "subsequent attempts to confirm these detections have been close to , but outside of , this frequency range .",
    "the non - detection at  35  mhz ( @xcite ) seems problematic , but a combination of a low - frequency cutoff in the spectrum and interstellar scintillation may explain the detection at  41  mhz and the upper limit at  35  mhz .",
    "the observations reported here are significant in that they are the only attempt to confirm the radio emission from geminga within the frequency range of the reported detections .",
    "our observations were conducted on 1998 march  9 with the vla in the a configuration ; table  [ tab : observelog ] summarizes various details .",
    "ionospheric phase variations would have vitiated a periodicity search , so our observations were designed only to image the pulse - averaged emission from the pulsar . the various detections suggest that the radio pulse is extremely wide , covering perhaps 90  of pulse phase .",
    "thus , our attempt to detect geminga should not be affected significantly by searching for a point source at its location .",
    "ccccccc    74 & 1.5 & 122 & 5.4 & @xmath7 @ 64   & 28 & @xmath8326 & 3 & 684 & 5.4 & @xmath9 @ 75  & 1.4 & 0.28    post - processing of low - frequency vla data uses procedures similar to those at higher frequencies , though certain details differ.url:http://rsd-www.nrl.navy.mil/7213/lazio/tutorial/@xmath10 . ] at  74  mhz cygnus  a served as both the flux density and visibility phase calibrator . at  326  mhz",
    "the primary flux density calibrator was 3c  48 whose flux density was taken to be 52.2  jy , and phase calibration was accomplished with frequent observations of 4c  14.18 . at both frequencies , after initial phase calibration , several iterations of hybrid mapping were used to improve the dynamic range .",
    "two significant differences for the post - processing were the impact of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and the large fields of view . in order to combat rfi ,",
    "the data were acquired with a much higher spectral resolution than used for imaging .",
    "excision of potential rfi is performed on a per - baseline basis for each 10-s visibility spectrum .",
    "the large fields of view ( 11  at  74  mhz , 25 at  326  mhz ) mean that the sky can not be approximated as flat . in order to approach the thermal - noise limit , we used a polyhedron algorithm ( @xcite ) in which the sky is approximated by many two - dimensional `` facets . ''",
    "we did not image the data at the same spectral resolution with which they were acquired .",
    "sources in our images are identified on the basis of their brightness .",
    "bandwidth smearing can cause weak sources in the outer portions of the primary beam to have a brightness below our detection threshold .",
    "the sidelobes of any such undetected sources contribute to the noise in the image . increasing the spectral resolution has the beneficial result of decreasing the amount of bandwidth smearing",
    ", however , it also increases the computational expense and the impact of diffractive scintillation .",
    "in fact , for reasonable choices of the scintillation properties for the line of sight toward geminga (  [ sec : scintillate ] ) , the impact of diffractive scintillation will be unchanged for the range of spectral resolutions we have available .",
    "the primary factors for deciding the spectral resolution are the desire to minimize bandwidth smearing _ vs. _ computational expense .",
    "the bandwidths we used122  khz at  74  mhz and  684  khz at  326  mhz  gave modest spectral resolutions ( a few ) , modest bandwidth smearing near the edge of the primary beam ( @xmath11% ) , and reasonable imaging times ( less than a few days of computation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:74 ] shows our 74  mhz image of the immediate region around geminga .",
    "the off - source rms noise level on this image is 28  , and the estimated thermal limit is 25  .",
    "figure  [ fig:326 ] shows our 326  mhz image of the immediate region around geminga .",
    "the off - source rms noise level on this image is 1.4  , and the estimated thermal limit is 0.5  .    one additional impact on the 74  mhz observations is ionospheric refraction , which shifts the field of view without distorting the brightness distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "shifts at  74  mhz are typically a few arcminutes and vary on time scales of tens of minutes .",
    "self - calibration `` freezes '' out this refraction but destroys absolute position information .",
    "fortunately , the primary beam is large enough that a typical image contains many tens of sources identified in the 1400  mhz nrao vla sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we constructed a reference grid using 42 nvss sources that were either unresolved or slightly resolved ( diameters @xmath12 ) . in determining the reference grid ,",
    "we checked for any systematic trends as a function of position within the 74  mhz image , flux densities of the sources , or angular diameters of the sources .",
    "none were found .",
    "we shifted the 74  mhz image by the median offsets , 39 in right ascension and @xmath13 in declination .",
    "based on the variances of the offsets from the reference sources , our 74  mhz astrometry should be accurate to approximately 5 , a fraction of the beam diameter , for an individual source .",
    "figure  [ fig:74 ] has been corrected for refraction .",
    "in this section we address our upper limits on geminga s flux density and the impact of scintillation on them .",
    "we shall follow the procedure described by mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for dealing with the effects of interstellar scintillation ( iss ) .    briefly",
    ", their procedure involves convolving the known probability density functions ( pdfs ) for the diffractive iss gain and noise in the image to produce a pdf for the measured flux density for the scintillating source .",
    "this pdf is then multiplied by a _",
    "prior _ for the intrinsic flux density of the source ( geminga ) to form the _ posterior _ for the intrinsic flux density of the source .",
    "as our images were constructed using an fft , without specifying a zero - spacing flux density , we have assumed ( and verified ) the noise in the image has a zero - mean gaussian pdf .",
    "in addition to the rms noise in the image ( table  [ tab : observelog ] ) , we require two additional parameters : a measure of the strength of diffractive iss and a measured flux density at the location of geminga .",
    "the former is provided by @xmath14 , the number of `` scintilles '' or scintillation intensity maxima occurring during the entire observation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for geminga ,",
    "there are no published measurements of the relevant iss parameters , the scintillation time  @xmath15  or the scintillation bandwidth  @xmath16 .",
    "mclaughlin et al .  ( 1999 ) estimated these parameters to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "their values imply a scattering measure toward geminga of @xmath19  kpc  m@xmath20 . while consistent with the local distribution of scattering material , there are also large variations in the value of sm for pulsars at distances comparable to that of geminga : psr  j0437@xmath214715 with @xmath22  kpc and @xmath23  kpc  m@xmath20 ( @xcite ; johnston , nicastro , & koribalski  1998 ) _ vs. _",
    "psr  b0950@xmath308 with @xmath24  kpc and @xmath25  kpc  m@xmath20 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we shall adopt mclaughlin et al.s  ( 1999 ) value for sm but note how a different value affects our results . for our integration time and receiver bandwidth",
    ", the resulting values are @xmath26 at  74  mhz and @xmath27 at  326  mhz .",
    "we obtain the flux density at the location of geminga by integrating over an area of  1  beam at the position of geminga .",
    "we use the term `` flux density at the location of geminga '' because of the noise in the image .",
    "as the noise is zero - mean , there are both positive and negative intensity variations .",
    "a weak source combined with a large negative noise deviation could result in a measured flux density quite different than that of the intrinsic flux density of the source .",
    "given the sizes of the beams ( 6  at  326  mhz and  25  at  74  mhz ) , this integration also takes into account the uncertainty in the position of geminga which is less than 1  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by determining the upper limit on geminga s flux density if iss was not an issue .",
    "the position of geminga s optical counterpart , even taking into account its proper motion , is known to accuracy far better than the beam diameter of  25 .",
    "we therefore adopt an upper limit of  56  mjy , twice the rms noise level .    as @xmath28 , diss becomes more and more heavily quenched , and the pdf of the diss gain approaches a @xmath29-function centered on unity .",
    "we consider @xmath30 sufficiently large that diss will not affect our upper limit . if our adopted value of sm were too large , and the correct value were @xmath31  kpc  m@xmath20comparable to that for psr  b0950@xmath308then @xmath32 .",
    "we would obtain an upper limit for geminga s flux density of @xmath33  mjy at the 95% confidence level .",
    "if we ignore iss , the 6  beam remains large enough that we adopt an upper limit of  2.8  mjy , again twice the rms noise level .",
    "our adopted value of sm implies @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast to the situation at  74  mhz , diss can have a substantial impact on the adopted flux density at  326  mhz .",
    "we find an upper limit on geminga s flux density of @xmath34  mjy at the 95% confidence level . if our adopted value of sm were too large , and the correct value were @xmath35  kpc  m@xmath20 , then @xmath36 .",
    "we would obtain an upper limit for geminga s flux density of @xmath37  mjy at the 95% confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] incorporates our upper limits with the limits and detections of geminga below  1000  mhz in the literature ; table  [ tab : log ] summarizes the data shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "can we reconcile our nondetection with the detections near  100  mhz ?",
    "one simple possibility is that the pulse - averaged radio emission from geminga is intrinsically time variable . in this case ,",
    "our nondetection is quite easy to reconcile with the various detections .",
    "vats et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that geminga is intrinsically time variable in order to explain their detection with a flux density of  1  jy at  103  mhz , and they speculate on intrinsic mechanisms that could be responsible .    even if we treat the vats et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detection at  103  mhz as an outlier , though , our nondetection is just consistent with the other detections near  100  mhz .",
    "shitov & pugachev  ( 1997 ) report a flux density of @xmath6  mjy at  102.5  mhz .",
    "clearly , if this is the intrinsic flux density , then there is no difficulty reconciling this with our nondetection .",
    "there are two difficulties with assuming a flux density of  8  mjy at  102  mhz , though .",
    "first , it requires geminga to have an extremely steep spectrum between 61 and  102  mhz , @xmath38 , though , geminga s radio emission mechanism might be different than that of other pulsars .",
    "second , it is difficult to explain other detections at  102  mhz .",
    "some combination of intrinsic and iss - induced intensity variation could in principle explain this dynamic range , but , in practice it might require improbably large diss gains .",
    "a more likely value for the 100  mhz flux density is near 50  mjy , in which case shitov & pugachev  ( 1997 ) detected it in an iss - depressed state .",
    "this explanation is appealing in two respects .",
    "first , a diss gain of  0.1 would depress the flux density from near 50  mjy to near 5  mjy , and a diss gain this small has a probability of occurrence near 90% .",
    "second , the spectral index between 61 and  102  mhz would be @xmath39 , more characteristic of radio pulsars . in this case , the expected flux density at  74  mhz is 80  mjy , above our upper limit for our nominal value of @xmath14 , but below it if our adopted value of sm is too large .    in reconciling our nondetection at  74  mhz with the detections ,",
    "we have relied on the robustness of the 41 and  61  mhz observations . in reporting their detections at these frequencies ,",
    "shitov et al .  (",
    "1997 ) did not indicate to what extent diss had been quenched .",
    "as diss is more likely to depress rather than enhance the flux density of a source , the 41 and  61  mhz detections could represent _ lower _ limits to geminga s flux density . if so , reconciliation would be more difficult .",
    "one aspect of iss not addressed quantitatively is the impact of _ refractive _ . at low frequencies",
    ", iss has an ancipital nature : diss occurring on `` short '' time scales and riss occurring on `` long '' time scales .",
    "riss is more difficult to quench than diss because its time scales are typically hours to days , so the flux density of geminga could be enhanced or suppressed for an entire observing run .",
    "riss could serve as the extrinsic mechanism that would contribute both to our non - detection ( and that of @xcite at  35  mhz ) and the detections near  100  mhz .",
    "riss is more difficult to handle quantitatively because its pdf is not as well constrained as the pdf for .",
    "some indication of the effect of riss can be obtained by adopting a log - normal pdf ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  20 ) ) .",
    "gupta , rickett , & coles  ( 1993 ) found a refractive intensity modulation variance @xmath40 for psr  b0950@xmath308 at  74  mhz .",
    "this variance , when used with a log - normal pdf , implies a ( 95% probability ) range of riss - induced variations of a factor of a few .",
    "thus , these low - frequency measurements and upper limits could have an additional factor of two or so uncertainty .    in summary ,",
    "we have not detected geminga at 74  mhz ( @xmath41  mjy ) or  326  mhz ( @xmath2  mjy ) .",
    "we can reconcile our nondetection with previous low - frequency detections by invoking intrinsic variability or extrinsic variability ( refractive interstellar scintillation ) or both .",
