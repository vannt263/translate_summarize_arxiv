    "the dynamics of relativistic compact objects is of interest both to the astrophysical and relativity communities .",
    "these objects represent on the one hand systems that may be active in stellar collapse , central engines for gamma ray bursts , and are potentially strong sources of gravitational radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "they represent non - trivial solutions to the einstein equations , possibly exhibiting directly the predictions of that theory for cosmic censorship and black hole formation .    despite the obvious interest in building a reliable spacetime description of such systems ,",
    "the process has been marred with difficulties  @xcite .",
    "one of the central problems concerns the formulation and solution of the initial value problem for the einstein equations , a research effort that is still largely ongoing .",
    "the numerical relativist must overcome a daunting list of problems , including a long term stable formulation of the initial value problem , the preservation of the constraints , the consistent imposition of boundary conditions and the reliable extraction of physical information ( including gravitational waveforms ) .",
    "we propose that for a wide and interesting class of spacetimes most of the above concerns can be successfully dealt with by the use of a characteristic initial value formulation for the einstein equations .",
    "in particular we argue that the study of the non - linear dynamics of isolated relativistic stars is optimally performed within this framework and we proceed to illustrate the technical procedures that support this claim .",
    "the incorporation of matter fields in the characteristic formulation of the einstein equation was considered as early as 1983  @xcite but the successful integration of the coupled system had to wait for the development of stable algorithms for the _ vacuum _ einstein problem .",
    "one dimensional schemes were developed in  @xcite .",
    "algorithms for axisymmetric spacetimes , notably including a regular origin , were presented in  @xcite .",
    "recently using similar techniques , axisymmetric vacuum black hole spacetimes have been evolved  @xcite .",
    "techniques for extending finite difference algorithms to 3d were presented in  @xcite .",
    "three dimensional codes excluding the origin of the light cones ( hence presently unsuitable for stellar collapse studies ) were presented in @xcite . for an alternative approach",
    "see  @xcite .    with reliable algorithms for the vacuum einstein equations available ,",
    "a new line of research for the incorporation of relativistic hydrodynamics into numerical relativity was initiated recently  @xcite .",
    "this approach brings into the considerations the modern machinery from computational fluid mechanics . in this procedure , the evolution equations for the matter fields are solved using relativistic high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) schemes  @xcite based upon ( exact or approximate ) riemann solvers .",
    "a general formalism has been developed , which is now being systematically applied to problems of increasing complexity .",
    "applications in spherical symmetry have already been presented in the literature : investigations of accreting dynamic black holes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "studies of the gravitational collapse of supermassive stars are discussed in  @xcite and studies of the interaction of scalar fields with relativistic stars are presented in  @xcite .",
    "we note that there has been already a proof - of - principle demonstration of the inclusion of matter fields in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the general framework laid out in  @xcite in the context of axisymmetric neutron star spacetimes .",
    "the code we have developed has been built upon previous work by gmez , papadopoulos and winicour  @xcite , who constructed an axisymmetric characteristic _ vacuum _ code .",
    "the numerical implementation of the field equations of general relativity is based on the light cone formalism of bondi  @xcite and tamburino - winicour  @xcite .",
    "the broad target of this project is the investigation of relativistic stellar dynamics ( including collapse ) using numerical relativity .",
    "a prerequisite for such studies is the development of very accurate and long - term stable general relativistic codes .",
    "it would seem that the feature list of the characteristic approach makes it ideal for such studies .",
    "one serious bottleneck of the approach is the breakdown of a lightlike coordinate system in the emergence of light caustics .",
    "interestingly though , due to its quasi - spherical nature , no matter how agitated a relativistic core , it is unlikely to focus the light cones emanating from its interior .",
    "the light cone approach has a number of advantages compared to spacelike foliations : i )  it is physically motivated ; the light cones offer a simple and unambiguous physical gauge on which to base the numerical spacetime grid .",
    "ii )  it is unconstrained ; the evolved variables capture rather directly the true degrees of freedom of the gravitational field .",
    "iii )  it is very efficient ; even in 3d , there are but two partial differential equations to solve , along with a set of radial integrations along the light cones .",
    "iv )  it allows for well defined compactification  @xcite of the domain , which leads to perfect outer boundary conditions .",
    "v )  finally , and perhaps most importantly , the above theoretical advantages have been shown in a series of works to translate to remarkably numerically robust and stable codes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for a recent review of the approach the reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "an important focus of research in numerical relativity has been the investigation of dynamical spacetimes of relativistic stars . while the pioneer investigations were mostly concerned with the study of spherically - symmetric gravitational collapse scenarios the effort is nowadays expanding to the study of the merging of compact neutron star binaries .",
    "advances in the numerical formulation of the equations as well as in computational power have made possible to transform the numerical evolution of neutron stars in general relativity into an active field of research  @xcite .",

    "the star rapidly expands and its central rest - mass density drops well below its initial value , less than @xmath187 , the central rest - mass density of the stable model of the same rest - mass . during the rapid decrease of the central density , the star acquires a large radial momentum .",
