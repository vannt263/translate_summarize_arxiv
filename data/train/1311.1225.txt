    "unraveling the evolution from population iii ( pop iii ) stars to the first galaxies is an open issue .",
    "the key to gain insight into this transition is to understand how gas is accreted onto proto - galaxies and its ability to conserve angular momentum or not .",
    "the latter has direct impact on the formation of possible discs @xcite , star formation @xcite or feeding of black hole seeds @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the angular momentum loss of accreted gas clouds around pop iii stars due to radiation drag by @xmath0 photons . in an isotropic radiation field",
    ", moving gas is exerted to stronger radiation pressure along opposite sites with respect to the moving direction due to the doppler shift .",
    "a similar effect on dust is classically known as the poynting - robertson effect @xcite and used to explain angular momentum loss of dust in the solar system .",
    "the effect of the radiation drag on primordial gas clouds in the early universe was studied analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite . @xcite and @xcite focused on the radiation drag exerted by the cosmic microwave background and suggested angular momentum of gas could efficiently be lost at @xmath13 , resulting in supermassive stars under the assumption that stellar source cause cosmic reionization , and that the cmb photons can efficiently be scattered by free electrons",
    ".    however , current theoretical work shows pop iii stars form at @xmath14 followed by the first galaxies at @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cmb is therefore no longer a possible source for efficient radiation drag on primordial gas .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the effects of radiation drag , in contrast to earlier work focusing on @xmath0 radiation fields produced by pop iii stars .",
    "unlike in the case for cmb photons , the number density of @xmath0 photons from pop iii stars can be much higher because they can be locally trapped within hii regions by scattering on their borders .",
    "in addition , the cross section near the line centre is quite high @xmath16 @xcite , which is @xmath17 orders of magnitude higher than the thomson scattering cross section . as a result ,",
    "the orbiting gas clouds in the @xmath0 radiation fields experience numerous scattering events and are subject to a drag force .",
    "however , unlike compton scattering of continuum radiation , scattering of @xmath0 photons is very sensitive to the velocity of the cloud .",
    "the doppler shift of the line centre and the strong frequency dependence of the cross section may lead to an only small drag force . in this letter , we study the effect of radiation drag on accreted gas clouds under different physical conditions such as e.g. , different stellar masses of pop iii stars , redshifts , and initial velocities of infalling clouds .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our model and method to calculate the radiation drag in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : result ] , we show the velocity evolution of test gas particles , and show the dependence on stellar mass and redshift .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our main conclusions and discuss limitations of our model .",
    "based on the current standard cold dark matter paradigm , halos grow via merging and accretion .",
    "high - density gas entering the hii regions around pop iii stars , which exceeds the virial radius of the halo @xcite , can stay neutral due to self - shielding ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but experience numerous scatter events with @xmath0 photons @xcite . the critical density required for such clouds to stay neutral via self - shielding in the vicinity of the pop iii star depends on the flux of stellar radiation seen by these clouds . following @xcite we can estimate the threshold density via , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ionizing photon emissivity of the star , and @xmath20 is the recombination coefficient to all excited levels of hydrogen @xcite , @xmath21 is the distance between the star and the gas cloud , @xmath22 is the hydrogen number density of the cloud and @xmath23 its radius . in this work , we assume that the gas temperature is @xmath24 in the hii region with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the left - side of the above equation is the maximum incident photon number , while the right - hand side is the total recombination rate in an ionized cloud . using typical parameters and rearranging the threshold density for self - shielding is given by , @xmath26",
    "the above relation approximates the limiting case of an ionizing front ( i - front ) not being able to sweep through a neutral gas cloud .",
    "once equilibrium between ionization and recombinations in the cloud is reached , the i - front stalls and ionization balance gives @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the volume of the ionized region .",
    "taking the volume - weighted neutral fraction @xmath29 of the cloud as @xmath30 with @xmath31 as the total volume of the cloud , the neutral fraction becomes @xmath32 .",
    "a cloud of @xmath33 with densities larger than @xmath34 will stay mostly neutral @xmath35 at a distance @xmath36 from a star with @xmath37 .",
    "this estimate is lower than in the case of ionization equilibrium under the optically thin approximation and same neutral fraction everywhere in the cloud , i.e. , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ionization cross section @xcite . under this approxmation",
    "the above cloud becomes @xmath35 at densities @xmath40 .",
    "however , in realistic situations the ionizing flux diminishes in the cloud and the neutral fraction can be much higher than the estimation under the optically thin approximation and typically deviates from this approximation at @xmath41 @xcite , suggesting this estimate to be an upper limit on the density .",
    "in addition , the equation  [ eq : ionthresh ] can be converted to a column density threshold by multiplying @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "a cloud of @xmath44 corresponds to a typical lyman limit system @xcite , and is mostly optically thick to external uv radiation as shown in recent cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "hence , clouds with @xmath45 are self - shielded against stellar radiation which is also supported by recent radiative - hydrodynamics simulations @xcite . to estimate whether infalling gas clouds at these high redshifts can indeed stay neutral we consider the case of a cloud in a mini halo being accreted at @xmath4 .",
    "its mean density is @xmath46 times that of the background @xcite , or @xmath47 .",
    "this is larger than the estimated threshold assuming a pop iii star of @xmath48 as the central source , and predicts neutral infall .",
    "further support comes from simulations by @xcite who show that a gas cloud accreted along a cosmic filament does survive photoevaporation even at a distance of 50 pc from the star ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the threshold density is sensitive to the separation to the star . if clouds enter the virial radius , within the life time of stars ( @xmath49 myr ) , for a virial radius of @xmath50 pc ( corresponding to a dark matter halo of @xmath51 at @xmath4 ) the threshold density gets @xmath52 which is larger than the mean density of the halo .",
    "it is therefore likely that some fraction of the infalling clouds , in particular those that come closest to the star on a short time scale , are destroyed due to the photoevaporation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even after the death of the central star in a hii region , @xmath0 photons are produced over a recombination timescale ( @xmath53 at z=20 ) , and can be trapped in the residual hii region . as well as",
    "@xmath0 photons , ionizing photons are also emitted by recombination from a halo .",
    "the total power of ionizing photons from a halo by recombination is similar to that by stellar sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leaving infalling clouds neutral due to self - shielding .",
    "the recombination time scale of gas in haloes is much smaller than that of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , @xmath54 yr terminating ionizing photons from a halo at almost the same time when the central star dies .",
    "although the production of ionizing photons from the igm is continuing its emissivity is small due to its low density . at this stage ,",
    "even lower - density accreted gas can stay neutral because there is no strong ionizing photon contribution and interact with the abundant @xmath0 photons .",
    "@xmath0 photons interacting along the direction of motion have larger energies than those opposite to it due to the doppler shift .",
    "this leads to a net momentum loss and drag force in the direction of motion of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the frequency of the line centre .",
    "figure  [ fig : img ] shows the schematic view of our model .",
    "the drag force is proportional to the number density of @xmath0 photons locked up within the hii region . in the following paragraphs",
    "we derive estimates for the number density of @xmath0 photons .",
    "we estimate the size of hii regions assuming a uniform inter - galactic medium ( igm ) around pop iii stars and neglect the clumpiness of the igm which has been shown in numerical simulations to be small and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the size of the hii region in equilibrium based on the strmgren sphere analysis @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the radius of the strmgren sphere , @xmath19 is the ionizing photon emissivity of stars , @xmath60 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the halo . for small haloes hosting pop iii stars ,",
    "most of the gas can easily evaporate due to photo - ionization and a large fraction of ionizing photon can escape @xcite .",
    "note however , that estimates for @xmath60 can vary significantly with halo and stellar mass @xcite , and are somewhat dependent on the resolution of the simulation @xcite .",
    "here we assume @xmath61 which is supported by recent simulations @xcite .",
    "the recombination time scale is of order @xmath62 and as such longer than the life time of massive pop iii stars resulting in the ionization front being within @xmath59 during the life time of the star @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is life time of the star , @xmath65 is the recombination time - scale , and @xmath66 is the radius of the ionization front .",
    "about 0.68 of ionizing photons emitted from stars are converted to @xmath0 photons via recombinations @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of these @xmath0 photons is scattered at the outer hi layer @xcite and locked inside the hii region , leading to a significant increase in their number density @xcite .",
    "we estimate the total number of @xmath0 photons in hii regions as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the trapping time of @xmath0 photons in the hii region . here , as a fiducial model , we assume for simplicity that @xmath69 .",
    "this model implies that absorbed ionizing photons in haloes convert to @xmath0 photons via the recombination process and are then stocked in the ionized region .",
    "the drag force @xmath70 is proportional to the number density of @xmath0 photons and thus @xmath71 because the ionized regions become smaller as @xmath72 and the total @xmath0 photon number increases with @xmath73 .",
    "hence , @xmath70 increases as the @xmath60 decreases , while the volume of the trapped @xmath0 radiation field becomes smaller .",
    "the frequency of @xmath0 photons changes during each scattering event . typically after an average of @xmath74 scattering events @xcite , the @xmath0 photon frequency changes to frequencies with low cross sections",
    "and they escape from the previously optically thick medium . in the case of outflowing gas like the igm",
    ", only photons at longer wavelength than @xmath75 can travel for long distances @xcite . on the other hand , for circumgalactic gas",
    "that is infalling only photons at shorter wavelengths can escape from the local region @xcite .",
    "if we consider an outflow paralleling the hubble flow , the optical depth for the igm is @xmath76 . under such circumstances @xmath0 photons",
    "are efficiently scattered at the outer hi layer @xcite .",
    "the trapping time of @xmath0 photons ( @xmath77 ) in hii regions can be much longer than the life time of pop iii stars @xmath5 @xcite by @xmath78 , here we use @xmath79 representative for a pop iii star with 120 @xmath80 at @xmath4 .",
    "hence , all emitted @xmath0 photons from haloes can be locked within the hii region .",
    "this estimate is an upper limit , as some fraction can enter into the hi layer and escape .",
    "please note that even after a star dies , the recombination processes in the residual hii region keeps producing @xmath0 and ionizing photons .",
    "the total number of @xmath0 photons continues increase during this time due to the trapping effect , while ionizing photons are destroyed via absorption by hydrogen and recombination to excited levels . in this work",
    "we use a constant value for the density of @xmath0 photons based on eq.[nlya ] . however , the trapping time becomes shorter in the recombining igm .",
    "@xcite derived the trapping time in spherical uniform and plane - parallel clouds .",
    "he showed @xmath81 for @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the optical depth of the @xmath0 line centre and @xmath84 is the crossing time of photons through a system of size @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 . to account for this",
    "we also study cases with lower photon densities with @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the number density of @xmath0 photons in the hii is then estimated by @xmath89 . in our model",
    "we assumes a spherical symmetric hii region . depending on the environment and physical situation",
    ", geometries in general can vary from highly non - symmetric @xcite to spherical @xcite .",
    "however , the number density of @xmath0 photons is dominated by the ionizing photon emissivity from the central star and the volume of hii region as explained above .",
    "it is not sensitive to the detailed shape of the hii region .",
    "we further assume a homogeneous @xmath0 radiation field in the hii region . in practice , since @xmath0 photons are emitted from high - density gas within the halo , the @xmath0 photon density increases towards the halo .",
    "however , due to the photon trapping effect and the associated scattering of lyman - alpha photons into random directions within the hii region , the cumulative number of @xmath0 photons is much higher than the in situ emission from the halo and the @xmath0 radiation field becomes highly homogeneous .    for conveniency , in what follows",
    "we introduce a variable @xmath90 , where @xmath91^{1/2}\\nu_{0}$ ] . the intensity",
    "can then be expressed as , @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the relative line width with the natural line width @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the voigt function @xcite , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the boundary frequency between a central resonant core and the power - law `` damping wings '' .",
    "we use the fitting formula by @xcite which can reproduce the voigt function smoothly even at @xmath99 . during each scattering event",
    ", the frequency of @xmath0 photons changes .",
    "however , when the optical depth of the igm is high , a very small fraction of @xmath0 photons at the wing part of the distribution can escape from local regions .",
    "hence , the line profile in hii region stays a voigt function .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of i - front does not accompany high - velocity motion of gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the line profile of @xmath0 photons is not significantly affected by the i - front propagation .    in the rest frame of the gas ,",
    "the radiation field is not isotropic due to the doppler shift of photons , resulting in a net drag force . by considering the anisotropic radiation pressure @xcite , the radiation drag in the @xmath0 radiation field is estimated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the cross section is estimated by @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the change in velocity for a gas cloud due to this drag is then @xmath104 . in",
    "what follows we will show results for the velocity evolution of gas clouds around a pop iii star of @xmath3 at @xmath4 as a fiducial case , and study cases with different masses and redshifts . for simplicity we will refer to velocity and angular momentum below and not separately distinguish between tangential and radial velocities , and momentum and angular momentum , respectively , as the @xmath0 field is isotropic and homogenous .",
    "photons is generated by recombinations in the hii region .",
    "gas can feel higher @xmath0 radiation pressure to the opposite of the moving direction due to the doppler shift , resulting in the radiation drag . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : frad_v ] shows @xmath70 as a function of gas velocity .",
    "the drag force @xmath70 is roughly proportional to the cross section and energy difference due to the doppler shift , both of which are functions of the relative velocity with respect to the background radiation field .",
    "the energy difference of photons by doppler shift is proportional to @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "hence , if @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , as a result , @xmath109 . on the other hand , if @xmath110 , @xmath111 , hence @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 radiation drag has a peak near @xmath113 . in comparison ,",
    "radiation drag due to the compton scattering of continuum radiation is simply proportional to the gas velocity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the absolute value of @xmath70 changes with stellar mass and redshift due to the change in the number density of @xmath0 photons , the functional shape does not .",
    "the shape depends only on the temperature of the gas from which @xmath0 photons are emitted . in this work , we assume @xmath114 , as a result the peak is at @xmath115 . with increasing temperature , the peak position moves to slightly larger velocities .",
    "however , the dependence on temperature is not significant in the range of @xmath116 which is the typical temperature of hii region . for @xmath114 and @xmath117 ( the case of @xmath118 at @xmath4 ) , we can roughly fit the drag force by @xmath119 if @xmath120 , and @xmath121 if @xmath122 . for different number densities",
    "@xmath123 the drag force can be estimated scaling these fits linearly with the number density .     at @xmath4 .",

    "the initial mass function of pop iii stars is still under debate , it likely depends on the environment of the formation site .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a large set of cosmological hydrodynamics simulations following 100 pop iii stars forming , and suggested that the mass of pop iii stars might range from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . to account for this uncertainty , we here calculate @xmath70 around pop iii stars for a range of masses with the ionizing photon emissivities and life times of pop iii stars taken from @xcite . the velocity evolution of gas clouds around pop iii stars of @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath4 are shown in figure  [ fig : v_mass ] .",
    "different line types represent different initial velocities of clouds .",
    "as shown in the figure , there is no clear difference in the velocity evolution for different stellar masses .",
    "since luminosity is linearly proportional to stellar mass and the effective temperature for the stars considered here is almost constant at @xmath130 @xcite , the ionizing photon emissivity linearly increases with stellar mass @xmath131 . as shown in equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath132 \\sim r_{\\rm s}^{3 } ( { t_{\\rm life}}/\\tau_{\\rm rec } ) \\propto { \\dot{n}_{\\rm ion}^{\\gamma}}{t_{\\rm life}}$ ] .",

    "these clouds pass through the peak of @xmath70 in their velocity evolution , and hence the time - averaged @xmath70 is higher than that of clouds starting out at @xmath134 . as a consequence , although their initial angular momenta are higher , the time scale required to reach @xmath141 is only slightly larger to that of @xmath134 . for gas with @xmath142 ,",
    "the velocity evolution is very slow , and becomes @xmath141 at @xmath143 which is comparable to the recombination time scale at @xmath4 .",
    "after recombination of the igm , the mean free path of @xmath0 photons becomes much shorter , and their frequency can quickly change to the red wing part , resulting in an escape from the local region and a drop in the number density of @xmath0 photons . in effect only gas with @xmath144 loose a significant fraction of its angular momentum .",

    "we have neglected the interaction within the virial radius which is subject to complex geometry and physical state of the gas . however , the size of the hii region is @xmath17 times larger than the typical virial radius ( @xmath155 ) , and most of the angular momentum will be lost during the phase outside the virial radius .",

    "in addition , continuous star formation keeps the production of @xmath0 photons ongoing and allows the radiation drag to occur for a longer time .",
    "hence , the situation with respect to the @xmath0 radiation drag around first galaxies is not certain .    after the death of stars , the central region in the hii recombines fast , resulting in a hii shell in between a central hi region and an outer hi border .",
    "the shell becomes smaller as the central region continues to recombine while the number of @xmath0 photons in the shell stays roughly constant .",
    "the radiation drag increases during this period in the shell , until it has recombined or the @xmath0 photons have escaped .    while the assumption of a uniform igm density is fair , the gas within the virial radius is highly inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "this limits the validity of our model from the edge of the hii region ( @xmath205 a few kpc ) to the virial radius ( @xmath205 a few hundreds pc ) .",
    "however , as we show above this is the dominant region in which angular momentum loss occurs .",
    "the evolution inside the halo is complex as e.g. shock waves exist with @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "these are generated in tandem with the i - front . at first ,",
    "due to the high - density gas around the star , the i - front is d - type and slowly propagates with the shock .",
    "then , reaching low - density regions , the i - front changes to r - type and quickly expands , while the shock is left behind stagnating at a propagation velocity of @xmath206 . as a result",
    ", the shock is at around the virial radius when the central star dies @xcite .",
    "once the clump reaches the virial radius , it is likely to interact with the shock and be compressed and heated up . as a result",
    ", the accreted gas may be destroyed or survive by efficient cooling emission @xcite .",
    "this evolution of the accreted gas at @xmath207 is out of the scope of our simple model in this paper .    in this work , as a first step",
    ", we use an analytic model to estimate the @xmath0 radiation drag by estimating the upper limit of the possible @xmath0 radiation field .",
    "it is important to note , that in our model trapping of @xmath0 photons is key .",
    "once e.g. supernovae efficiently blow out gas , @xmath0 photons are able to escape the local region and the radiation drag quickly becomes unimportant . in a follow - up study we will investigate the @xmath0 radiation drag in a more realistic set - up including a self - consistent time evolution within hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "we are grateful to y. li and m. umemura for valuable discussion and comments .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful comments ."
