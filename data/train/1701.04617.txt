    "large organizations such as banks , etc .",
    "make an increasing share of their business through the internet @xcite .",
    "typically , http is the protocol of choice to deliver services to the end - user , thanks to the widespread deployment of web clients in all kinds of mobile and desktop devices .",
    "therefore , measuring the quality of service ( qos ) provided by web portals @xcite becomes of strategic importance .",
    "the same applies to other application protocols ( voip , sip , rtp , rtcp ) @xcite but we focus on http due to its widespread usage .",
    "such qos evaluation is normally based on response time statistics ( from http query to reply ) and also on the analysis of response codes for the detection of anomalous behaviour in the monitored web services .",
    "for example , an http error 500 indicates an internal server error , which must be taken care  of .",
    "the dissection and analysis of http traffic can also be performed for cybersecurity purposes . however , the latter analysis is very fine - grain because security threats try to masquerade themselves among normal http traffic .",
    "therefore , losing a single http transaction matters for security and forensic analysis .",
    "in contrast , the scope our research is network and service monitoring and not security , whereby only aggregated statistics such as means , averages or probability distributions matter .",
    "indeed , for qos evaluation , only aggregate statistics are required , namely overall response time or percentage of a certain type of error codes .",
    "furthermore , such statistics should be provided in real - time in order to timely react to possible anomalies . once the overall statistics show performance degradation an in - depth analysis applies , which is normally performed off - line by inspecting the packets over a given time interval . in this light",
    ", the http traffic analysis tool must be agile enough to cope with multi - gb / s traffic rates and provide aggregate statistics in real - time , rather than providing a very high precision at the expense of a larger processing time .    in this paper",
    ", we propose : 1 ) to lighten the underlying tcp connection reassembly and also to use a novel load balancing technique in order to sustain large offered traffic loads while keeping the accuracy at a reasonable level .",
    "2 )  with this , we provide real - time aggregate statistics of the processed http traffic such as response time and response codes , among others .",
    "furthermore , we have also attained a sustained 20 gbps ( 2 x 10 gbps ) in a single host with several instances running in parallel .",
    "the proposed techniques have been implemented in the _ httpanalyzer _ tool , as proof of concept and testbed for performance evaluation .",
    "two real - world traces from large web commercial portals have been used to evaluate the maximum offered input traffic and the accuracy of the qos statistics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , prior to proceeding to the technical content of the paper we review the state of the art .",
    "second , we describe the methodology and the proposed techniques for web traffic analysis , which are based on partial knowledge of the tcp connection , sub - tcp connection load - balancing and packet sampling . finally , we discuss the performance evaluation and accuracy results , followed by the conclusions .",
    ".trace files [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + received packets & 49.86% & 50.02% & 49.94% & 50.02% + http transactions & 50.01% & 49.98% & 50.01% & 49.98% +    [ tab : scenariob ]    interestingly , all the four instances received roughly the same load , as table  [ tab : scenariob ] shows .",
    "the results indicate that our proposed hash technique is very effective in load balancing .",
    "tests with 40gbe links could not be performed as this technology is yet minority and expensive , also owing to the limit of the traffic player that prevents us from testing higher speeds .",
    "however , these results show promise that our tool can handle higher rates using this very same approach of load sharing between multiple _ httpanalyzer _ instances .",
    "to complete our throughput assessment , we compared the processing speed ( or analysis throughput ) of httpanalyzer versus tshark .",
    "even though tshark provides highly detailed http metrics , it turns out that it can not cope with traffic sent at high speed for real - time analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : tshark_speed ] shows the processing speed of httpanalyzer and tshark .",
    "it can be observed that httpanalyzer is 43 times faster than tshark .",
    "the measurement experiment was performed offline , reading traces from a ram filesystem as we did in [ sec : single_tests ] .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : tshark_loss ] represents the packet loss that tshark suffered when traffic was injected at 10 gbps speed during an online measurement experiment similar to those in section [ sec : multi_tests ] .",
    "clearly , the packet loss is very significant , which deems tshark not adequate for on - line traffic analysis purposes in multi - gbps scenarios .",
    "actually , there is a trade - off between tshark accuracy and httpanalyzer speed .",
    "however , the httpanalyzer accuracy is remarkable ( as shown in [ sec : accuracy ] ) , which , together with the throughput limitations of tshark presented in this section , makes httpanalyzer the tool of choice for real - time analysis of high speed traffic .",
    "in this paper , we present a high - performance http traffic analyzer that achieves 10 gbps throughput with a single instance of the tool .",
    "a remarkable throughput of 20 gbps online with live traffic can be achieved using multiple instances of the tool , thanks to our proposed hash function .",
    "all these results have been obtained in commodity hardware , with no need of ad - hoc high - speed network processors or massively parallel devices .",
    "finally , our tool provides real - time statistics of different aggregate metrics to measure the qos of web traffic in large organizations .",
    "such metrics are of strategic importance because of its close relation with the quality of experience of the final user , allowing to detect changes in the web services behaviour on - the - fly .",
    "the authors used the testbed 10 g trace tester @xcite , which is part of the european project fed4fire under the aegis of the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7 ) under grant fp7-ict-318389 .",
