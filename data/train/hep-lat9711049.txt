    "a useful formulation of gauge theories , both from the conceptual and methodological point of view , is the one in terms of gauge invariant excitations or string - like objects .",
    "the so - called _ p - representation _",
    "@xcite , consisting of a hilbert space of path labeled states , has been used on the lattice to perform analytical hamiltonian calculations . a cluster approximation allowed to provide qualitatively good results for the @xmath0 qed @xcite and the @xmath1 qed @xcite with staggered fermions . a description in terms of paths or strings ,",
    "besides the general advantage of only involving gauge invariant excitations , is appealing because all the gauge invariant operators have a simple geometrical meaning when realized in the path space .",
    "however , the computational method implemented , up to now , on a formally _ infinite _ lattice , has the serious drawback of the explosive proliferation of clusters with the order of the approximation . in order to tackle this difficulty we propose in this paper to explore the previous method implemented now on a _",
    "finite lattice_. as a first test , we choose the simplest lattice gauge theory with dynamical fermions , the schwinger model or ( 1 + 1 ) qed .",
    "this massless model can be exactly solved in the continuum and it is rich enough to share relevant features with 4-dimensional qcd as confinement or chiral symmetry breaking with an axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "for this reason it has been extensively used as a laboratory to analyze the previous phenomena .",
    "the lattice schwinger model also become a popular benchmark to test different techniques to handle dynamical fermions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this article is organized into four sections . in section 2",
    "we show the formulation of the model in the p - representation .",
    "the electric and interaction components of the hamiltonian operator are realized in this basis of  electromeson \" states . in section 3 ,",
    "first , we describe the finite lattice hamiltonian approach .",
    "second , we show the calculation of the ground - state energy , the mass gap and chiral condensate . these results are discussed in the concluding section .",
    "the p - representation offers a gauge invariant description of physical states in terms of kets @xmath2 , where @xmath3 labels a set of connected paths @xmath4 with ends @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a lattice of spacing @xmath7 . in the continuum ,",
    "the connection between the p - representation and the ordinary representation (  configuration \" representation ) , in terms of the fermion fields @xmath8 and the gauge fields @xmath9 $ ] , can be performed considering the natural gauge invariant object constructed from them : @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] ( @xmath12 denote the links ) .",
    "the immediate problem we face is that @xmath13 is not purely an object belonging to the `` configuration '' basis because it includes the canonical conjugate momentum of @xmath8 , @xmath14 .",
    "the lattice offers a solution to this problem consisting in the decomposition of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "let us consider the hilbert space of kets @xmath15 , where @xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath17 part of the dirac spinor and @xmath18 to the @xmath19 part .",
    "those kets are well defined in terms of `` configuration '' variables ( the canonical conjugate momenta of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . ) then , the internal product of one of such kets with one of the path dependent representation ( characterized by a lattice path @xmath4 with ends @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) is given by @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote a component of the spinor @xmath16 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "thus , it seems that the choice of staggered fermions is the natural one in order to build the lattice p - representation .",
    "therefore , the lattice paths @xmath4 start in sites @xmath5 of a given parity and end in sites @xmath6 with opposite parity . the one spinor component at each site can be described in terms of the susskind s @xmath28 single grassmann fields @xcite .",
    "the path creation operator @xmath29 in the space of kets @xmath30 of a path with ends @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined as @xmath31 its adjoint operator @xmath32 acts in two possible ways @xcite : annhilating the path @xmath33 or joining two existing paths in @xmath34 one ending at @xmath5 and the other starting at @xmath6 .",
    "the schwinger hamiltonian is given by    @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath5 labels sites , @xmath39 the spatial links pointing along the spatial unit vector @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the electric field operator , the kets @xmath42 are eigenvectors of this operator @xmath43 where the eigenvalue @xmath44 is the number of times that the link @xmath45 appears in the set of paths @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath46 are  displacement \" operators corresponding to the quantity defined in ( [ eq : phi ] ) for the case of a one - link path i.e. @xmath47 . the realization of both hamiltonian terms in this representation is as follows @xcite :    by ( [ eq : e ] ) the action of the electric hamiltonian is given by @xmath48 the interaction term @xmath49 is realized in the loop space as @xmath50 where the factor @xmath51 is 0 or @xmath52 dictated by the algebra of the operators .",
    "the different actions of operators @xmath46 over path - states @xmath53 and their corresponding @xmath51 are schematically summarized in fig.1",

    "our method of calculation works assuming a lattice of some fixed even number of sites @xmath54 and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . starting with the zero - path state @xmath55 ( infinite coupling vacuum ) , then a collection of new states @xmath56 are generated by applying successively the non - diagonal @xmath57 interaction hamiltonian operator  whose action is to add or to eliminate links to to the path @xmath58 as it was described in the previous section  up to order @xmath59 .",
    "the traslational symmetry can be exploited in order to reduce the dimension of the space tacking only one representative @xmath60 of each class of translationally equivalent paths @xmath61 . the hamiltonian matrix , with all the transitions between the different states @xmath62 ,",
    "is then built for the scalar and vector sectors and their eigenvalues @xmath63 are numerically evaluated .    in order to perform the generation and recognition of diagrams ( the elementary lattice paths ) as well as the computation of transitions between them",
    ", we resorted to the prolog language which is very suitable to carry out the symbolic manipulations .",
    "the calculations of the ground - state energy , mass gap and chiral order parameter were performed on lattices ranging from size @xmath64 to @xmath65 and at least up to order @xmath66 in each case .",
    "our aim is to extrapolate these results to the continuum limit : @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 . )",
    "it is clear from the plots ( figs . 2 to 5 ) that the lattice results show convergence to the expected continuum values .",
    "this convergence is , however , non - uniform and for @xmath70 large enough the plots show deviation from the continuum values although the region of assimptotic regime becomes larger when the size is increased .",
    "it is patent that for a fixed lattice size @xmath54 the best results for the vacuum energy and the chiral condensate are achieved for order @xmath71 .",
    "this appears to be the order at which the finite size effects are minimized .",
    "this is not the case with the mass gap which always gets closer to the continumm value when the order increases .",
    "_ ground state energy _    in the continuum limit",
    "the ground - state energy density is known exactly @xcite : @xmath72 when the order increases @xmath73 tends to a fixed value . for a fixed size @xmath54 the closer value to ( [ eq : e - exact ] ) is given by order @xmath71 . the value for size @xmath65 and",
    "order @xmath74 at @xmath75 is @xmath76 , so the discrepancy from the exact value is less than 0.05 % .",
    "the approximations converge with considerable rapidity .",

    "-13 mm    -10 mm    in order to obtain a result in a consistent way we compute the energy for two large values of @xmath70 , for three correlative large orders and for three correlative large sizes .",
    "then , for fixed size and order we first extrapolate to @xmath80 assuming the behaviour @xmath81 .",
    "second , for fixed size we extrapolate to infinite order assuming exponential dependence .",
    "finally we extrapolate to infinite size assuming exponential behaviour .",

    "when we reach larger @xmath54 we observe that the value of the mass gap improves substantially .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "3 we show a plot of the mass gap for @xmath101 for several orders . as it can be seen in the region @xmath102 , the mass gap values decrease with the order and the size approaching the continuum result . given the non - uniformity of the convergence it is more difficult to extrapolate to the limit although values @xmath103 are obtained at the modest size of @xmath104 .",

    "an interesting quantity to compute is the vacuum expectation of the chiral condensate per - lattice - site @xmath105 , defined as @xmath106 , \\label{eq : chir - cond}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the corresponding operator is realized in the p - representation and thus we get for the chiral condensate : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of connected paths in @xmath3 . to compute @xmath105 the @xmath110 hamiltonian is modifyed as @xmath111 ,   \\label{eq : w'}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "thus , @xmath105 is obtained in the standard way as @xmath113    the massless continuum schwinger model undergoes a breaking of chiral symmetry with @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the euler constant .",
    "this non - zero value of the chiral condensate is one of the main efects of the axial anomaly .    in fig .",
    "4 we report the value of the chiral condensate per - lattice - site for lattice sizes ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath101 . fig .",
    "5 shows this chiral order parameter for different lattice sizes up to order @xmath90 for each size .",
    "notice that the results in the weak coupling region converge to the corresponding continuum value ( [ eq : chiral - cont ] ) as long as @xmath54 increases while for a fixed @xmath54 the value improves with the order @xmath59 till the value @xmath90 is reached .",
    "our general proposal is to to show that the p - representation is a valuable and alternative computational tool for gauge theories with dynamical fermions . in particular , in this work , we wanted to test the hamiltonian approach on finite lattices . with tis aim , we chose the simplest model : ( 1 + 1 ) qed .",
    "this also enables us to compare with the corresponding numerical simulations @xcite using the lagrangian counterpart of the p - representation or the socalled _ worldsheet formulation _ @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows that , for this case of one spatial dimension , the hamiltonian method is less time consuming .",
    "the results are very good and confirm the belief of hamer et al @xcite in obtaining with considerable accuracy the observables working on lattices of moderate size .",
    "consequently , this procedure is appealing because one can run all the needed computations in small machines obtaining quite fair results ."
