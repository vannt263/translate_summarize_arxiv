    "massive stars ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) , though few in number , play a fundamental role in the evolution of their host galaxies . via high - density stellar winds , these objects strongly enrich the interstellar medium with chemically processed material , and deposit large amounts of momentum and energy into their surroundings during their entire lifetime , until they explode as spectacular supernovae .",
    "the post - main sequence evolution of massive stars contains several short - lived transition phases , in which stars undergo strong massloss and mass ejections .",
    "the massloss during each phase greatly drives the subsequent evolution of the star .",
    "however , the amount of mass lost in each transition phase is still highly uncertain as it depends on many parameters , such as stellar rotation , metallicity , magnetic fields , etc , several of which are still poorly constrained .",
    "hence , for accurate predictions from stellar evolution calculations , detailed knowledge of the properties of these massive stars in transition is of vital importance .",
    "two types of massive stars in transitional evolutionary stages , which occupy and share the upper - left domain in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , are particularly puzzling : luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) .",
    "stars in both groups are rare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that these intermediate stages have rather short lifetimes . nevertheless , these are extremely important objects as they undergo strong , often asymmetric massloss , driving the dynamics and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium , as well as dust formation in their circumstellar environments .",
    "the ejected material of lbvs usually accumulates in either elliptic or bipolar nebulae of ionized gas , often with indication for clumped wind structures , and cool dusty rings . on the other hand ,",
    "b[e]sgs have dense , high - ionized polar winds and equatorial rings or disks , which are detached from the star and consist of low - ionized or neutral atomic material and hot molecular gas and warm dust .",
    "the mass ejection and disk formation mechanisms in both types of stars are still largely unknown , however , it has been suggested that binarity , rapid rotation , or stellar pulsations might play a significant role .",
    "lbvs undergo episodic mass loss and eruptions .",
    "they typically occur in two ` flavors ' , hot and cool ( following the notation of * ? ? ?",
    "cool lbvs are in ` outburst ' , and as such undergo an excursion to the red side of the hrd , i.e. , they appear to evolve from a hot into a cool supergiant and simultaneously brighten until they reach visual maximum when approaching the cool edge . at visual minimum ,",
    "lbvs reside on the blue side , where they are considered to be in their hot or ` quiescent ' phase .",
    "these periodic outbursts ( so - called s - dor cycles ) happen on timescales of months to years .",
    "on much longer timescales ( of a thousand years ) , lbvs may experience phases of very strong or eruptive mass loss .",
    "several b[e]sgs are found to show some sort of variability and sudden , enhanced mass loss similar to what is reported for lbvs , suggesting an evolutionary link , with b[e]sgs as either the progenitors or the descendants of lbvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while evolutionary calculations fail so far to predict the b[e]sg phase , the enrichment of the disk material in @xmath3co , which reflects the stellar surface enrichment in @xmath3c , suggests that most ( if not all ) b[e]sgs are in an evolutionary stage just beyond the main - sequence .",
    "no information on the @xmath3c surface enrichment is available for lbvs , so that other criteria for a possible link need to be considered .",
    "the occurrence of the lbv phase in the evolution of massive stars depends on the stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stars with initial masses lower than @xmath4m@xmath5 turn into lbvs as post - red supergiants , and it seems that these low - luminosity lbvs could directly explode as core - collapse supernovae of type ii . in this scenario , a direct lbv progenitor or descendant stage for b[e]sgs appears unlikely .",
    "however , a star in this mass range can pass through a b[e]sg phase before evolving into a red supergiant .",
    "stars with higher initial masses turn into lbvs much earlier , i.e. , already during their redward evolution .",
    "b[e]sgs lack extended large - scale structures that might be identified with lbv nebula remnants , rendering it questionable that they could be lbv descendants . on the other hand ,",
    "b[e]sgs have been suggested to be the predecessor of blue supergiants with bipolar ring nebulae , in which the hot molecular disk material has expanded and cooled and condensed into dust particles @xcite .",
    "two well - known representatives of such blue supergiants are sbw1 and sher25 , and both of them are in turn very similar to the precursor of sn1987a ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "notably , @xcite recently suggested the b[e]sg s18 in the small magellanic cloud to be a viable sn1987a progenitor candidate .",
    "hence , b[e]sgs might themselves be supernova progenitors without evolving through an lbv phasesgs display variabilities that might be associated with lbv behavior ( such as s18 , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none of them was so far observed to perform s - dor - like cycles , i.e. , none appeared as a cool supergiant .",
    "hence , they are ( still ) considered ` real ' ( or typical ) b[e]sgs . ] .",
    "whether all high - luminosity b[e]sgs will directly evolve into sn1987a progenitors , or whether maybe a subset might indeed become lbvs , is currently unknown , but underlines the need for larger samples of these rare objects .",
    "identification of members of these two groups can be quite difficult .",
    "the best known sample of b[e]sgs to date is located in the magellanic clouds , while unambiguous classification of galactic counterparts is usually hampered by the lack of proper distances ( and hence luminosity values ) , so that they can be easily confused with other objects surrounded by dense disks , such as the herbig ae / be stars , unless near - infrared spectra display emission from @xmath3co .",
    "b[e]sgs are found exclusively on the luminous , blue side of the hr diagram , and their optical spectra are practically indistinguishable from those of hot lbvs , as both types of stars display strong line emission formed in their dense circumstellar matter .",
    "classification of bonafide lbvs without evidence of a giant eruption is particularly difficult , and requires both long - term and multi - wavelength monitoring .",
    "much effort has been undertaken in recent years to resolve massive star populations and , in particular , to identify lbvs and b[e]sgs in the milky way and local group galaxies for obvious reasons : ( 1 ) samples of these rare objects are increased , which is vital to improve our understanding of stellar evolution of massive stars in general , and to study evolutionary connections between lbvs and b[e]sgs in particular , ( 2 ) extragalactic b[e]sgs are easily distinguished from , e.g. , herbig stars due to well constrained distances , and hence luminosities , and ( 3 ) the occurrence of these particular evolutionary phases can be studied as a function of metallicity .",
    "potential lbvs are identified by searching for stars that are spectroscopically indistinguishable from known lbvs .",
    "these stars are called lbv - candidates",
    ". however , given the difficulties in disentangling spectroscopically between hot lbv candidates and b[e]sgs , every hot lbv candidate is at the same time also a b[e]sg candidate .    in a recent near - infrared survey , reveal that hot lbvs and b[e]sgs have clearly distinct infrared characteristics .",
    "the two groups populate discrete regions in the @xmath6 versus @xmath7 color - color diagram , due to the larger amount of hot dust in the environment of b[e]sgs . furthermore , while both types of stars display practically identical emission features in their @xmath0-band spectra , the study found co emission only in stars classified as b[e]sgs , likely a consequence of their massive , stable dusty disks , which allow molecules to form at significant rates for easily detectable emission .",
    "although a few b[e]sgs were found to lack co band emission , the presence of these molecular bands in combination with near infrared colors typical for b[e]sgs provide clear evidence for a b[e]sg rather than an lbv nature of the star magnitudes position it clearly in the lbv corner of the color - color diagram . ] .",
    "these two characteristics hence seem to provide an ideal tool to separate b[e]sgs from hot lbvs , and we apply it to identify b[e]sgs in local group galaxies , which are hidden in hot lbv candidate samples . in this letter",
    "we present our first results on four objects in m31 .",
    "we selected four stars in m31 with 2mass object names j00404307 + 4108459 , j00433308 + 4112103 , j00441709 + 4119273 , and j00452257 + 4150346 .",
    "three were identified by @xcite as hot lbv candidates , while j00433308 + 4112103 (= ) is a bonafide lbv @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-band spectroscopic observations of the targets were obtained in august and october 2013 at gemini north with the gemini near infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) . using the longslit mode with the 0.30  slit , the short camera , and the 110 l / mm grating",
    ", we achieved a resolving power of @xmath8 and a wavelength coverage from 2.23 to 2.40 @xmath9 m . several abba sequences ( nodding along the slit ) were taken for each target . an early a - type star ( close to the target in position and airmass )",
    "was observed immediately before or after each sequence for telluric absorption correction .",
    "flats and arcs were taken with each source .",
    "we used iraf software package tasks to extract and calibrate the spectra .",
    "the data reduction steps included subtraction of the ab pairs , flatfielding , telluric - correction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "finally , the spectra were corrected for heliocentric and systemic velocities , and normalized .",
    "observation details are listed in table[tbl_obs ] .",
    "the final normalized @xmath0-band spectra of the objects are shown in fig.[fig_spectra ] .",
    "the spectra of j00441709 + 4119273 and j00452257 + 4150346 clearly display co band emission and emission from the hydrogen pfund series .",
    "j00404307 + 4108459 only shows emission from the pfund series .",
    "the spectrum of j00433308 + 4112103 is rather noisy , but there is no evidence for either co band or pfund line features .",
    "we model the emission of the pfund line series ( sect.[pfund ] ) and the two molecular components @xmath10co and @xmath3co ( sect.[co ] ) ; the best model fits to the observations are shown in fig.[fig_co ] .",
    "typically , emission from the hydrogen pfund series originates from a dense wind .",
    "this high density environment can lead to pressure ionization effects , and hence to a sharp cut - off in the maximum number of detectable pfund lines .",
    "we model the pfund recombination line spectra using the code developed by .",
    "the line emission is not sensitive to the electron temperature .",
    "we therefore fix the temperature at @xmath11k , which is a typical value for an ionized wind .",
    "the line profiles show no indication for rotational broadening beyond the spectral resolution of @xmath12kms@xmath13 .",
    "we thus adopt a pure gaussian profile , which is a reasonably good approximation for optically thin recombination lines formed in a stellar wind .",
    "we model the emission from the co first - overtone bands using the code developed by , extended by and .",
    "the appearance of the band heads is caused by the superposition of many individual ro - vibrational co lines .",
    "profiles of the ro - vibrational lines are typically double - peaked , indicating that the emission originates from a ( keplerian ) rotating disk or ring , and the first co band head , appearing at 2.3@xmath9 m , displays a characteristic structure consisting of a blue shoulder and a red peak . in the spectrum of j00441709",
    "+ 4119273 , the first co band head lacks this characteristic structure indicative of rotational broadening .",
    "consequently , any present rotational velocity , projected to the line of sight , must be comparable or smaller than the spectral resolution , and we obtain a reasonably good fit for @xmath14kms@xmath13 .",
    "no satisfactory fit was obtained when using a pure gaussian profile for the individual ro - vibrational lines , excluding a spherical wind or shell as the location of the co molecules .",
    "the spectrum of j00452257 + 4150346 is too noisy to make any inferences about the shape of its first band head , but , as the spectral features look very similar to those in j00441709 + 4119273 , we adopt the same rotational broadening . from the strength of the higher band heads and the level of the quasi - continuum in between them",
    ", we obtain the molecular temperature and column density .",
    "the spectra also contain emission from the molecular isotope @xmath3co , and we determine a value of @xmath15 for the @xmath10co/@xmath3co ratio in both stars .",
    "this value mirrors the stellar surface enrichment in @xmath10c/@xmath3c at the time of mass ejection .",
    "the complete set of model parameters derived from the fitting is given in table[tbl_param ] .",
    "the co emitting regions are confined to relatively cool but dense rotating rings of material , detached from the surface of the star , as was also found in galactic and magellanic cloud b[e]sgs .      according to , lbvs and b[e]sgs are located in distinct regions in the @xmath6 versus @xmath7 color - color diagram ( fig.[fig_color ] ) . using the colors of the sample stars , obtained from the @xmath16 magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , with the exception of j00452257 + 4150346",
    "whose @xmath17 and @xmath18 band magnitudes are taken from @xcite , and plotting them together with the objects from demonstrates that two objects , j00441709 + 4119273 and j00452257 + 4150346 , reside in the region populated by b[e]sgs .",
    "the star j00433308 + 4112103 falls into the lbv corner of the color - color diagram , confirming its bonafide lbv status .",
    "the location of j00404307 + 4108459 is difficult to ascertain as for this star only the @xmath0-band magnitude is accurately known .",
    "its @xmath17- and @xmath18-band values , and hence @xmath7 , are only upper limits .",
    "the @xmath7 value is smaller than those of typical b[e]sgs , indicating that j00404307 + 4108459 might belong to the group of hot lbvs .",
    "we present near - infrared spectra of three hot lbv candidates and one bonafide lbv star in m31 .",
    "the chosen spectral range covers the wavelength region of the co bands .",
    "although not all confirmed b[e]sgs do show co band emission , their presence is an encouraging indication of a b[e]sg .",
    "a further , necessary criteria for classification as a b[e]sg is provided by the star s position in the @xmath6 versus @xmath7 color - color diagram , in which lbvs and b[e]sgs populate clearly distinct regions .",
    "the bonafide lbv star in our sample , j00433308 + 4112103 , shows no indication for co band emission , and its @xmath16-band magnitudes place it into the lbv corner of the color - color diagram , confirming its lbv status .",
    "furthermore , while @xcite caught the star in its hot phase , its current featureless near - infrared spectrum resembles that of lha120-s155 , an lbv in the lmc found in outburst , indicating that j00433308 + 4112103 is currently also in outburst .",
    "not much is known at present about the object j00404307 + 4108459 . based on its optical spectra ,",
    "@xcite classify it as hot lbv candidate .",
    "its near - infrared spectrum clearly displays emission from the hydrogen pfund series , but no indication for co band emission . as",
    "not all b[e]sgs show co band emission , the absence of co bands alone does not prohibit per se a b[e]sg nature of the object .",
    "however , considering the location of the star in the infrared color - color diagram , which falls clearly outside the typical region for b[e]sgs , we can classify this star as a hot lbv .",
    "co emission has been detected in the objects j00441709 + 4119273 and j00452257 + 4150346 , suggesting that these stars are in fact b[e]sgs . in an earlier study , @xcite mention",
    "that the star j00441709 + 4119273 ( which they named k350 ) shares many characteristics with b[e]sgs , but as their optical spectrum does not show forbidden emission lines , these authors tentatively classify j00441709 + 4119273 as an lbv candidate . in contrast",
    ", the higher quality optical spectrum of @xcite shows these forbidden lines , typical criteria for b[e]sgs .",
    "@xcite also saw forbidden line emission in the spectrum of j00452257 + 4150346 .",
    "this object was recently included in the study of @xcite , who suggest that the star is a warm hypergiant of spectral type a1ia , similar to the yellow hypergiants .",
    "however , yellow hypergiants with co band emission are found in an area close to the lbvs in the color - color diagram , and usually lack pfund line emission .",
    "based on the clear presence of co band emission in our near - infrared spectra , and the location of the stars in the b[e]sg domain of the color - color diagram , we firmly classify j00441709 + 4119273 and j00452257 + 4150346 as the first b[e]sgs identified in m31 .",
    "the discovery of b[e]sgs in m31 opens new perspectives in studying members of this enigmatic group , which seem to be linked to progenitors of supernovae of type sn1987a . with a metallicity about twice solar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m31 is an ideal laboratory for testing massive star evolutionary models at high metallicity .",
    "the @xmath3co enrichment of the circumstellar material found from our analysis is stronger than that typically found in galactic and magellanic cloud b[e]sgs . as the evolution of massive stars changes severely with metallicity and rotation speed",
    ", this might indicate that either these stars were initially rapidly rotating , or they are very massive , with surface enrichment strongly enhanced due to the increased mass loss at higher metallicity .    to improve our understanding of stellar evolution of massive stars and their mass loss behavior at different metallicities , it is essential to continue to resolve massive star populations and identify b[e]sgs and lbvs in other local group galaxies",
    ". furthermore , the methodology used here to distinguish between types of pre - supernova objects will be a crucial tool to study these stars in more obscured areas , such as the galactic center or other highly reddened regions , where optical observations are not possible .",
    "this will increase both our knowledge and sample size leading to better statistics and more reliable conclusions about the nature and origin of b[e]sgs and lbvs .",
