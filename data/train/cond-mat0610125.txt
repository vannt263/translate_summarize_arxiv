    "the propagation of activity in spatially extended systems has attracted much attention in the last centuries , starting from celestial mechanics in the sixteenth century to the study in complex physical , chemical or biological systems  @xcite in the last decades . in such systems the communication between",
    "the system subunits plays a decisive role .",
    "these subunits may be coupled locally to their next neighbors or may reveal longer - distance connections . in the latter case ,",
    "the finite speed of interactions , i.e. the finite propagation speed , may yield temporal delays which affect the space - time dynamics of the system .",
    "such effects have been found in several systems , e.g. in neural networks  @xcite , quantum devices  @xcite , porous and non - homogeneous media  @xcite , in metals irradiated by laser pulses  @xcite , hot plasma  @xcite and electronic circuits  @xcite as the internet or computational networks . + in order to describe spatial systems mathematically , partial differential equations ( pde ) have been applied widely . however , most pde models neglect effects caused by finite propagation speeds in the system . to consider these effects in pde models ,",
    "various approaches have been followed as , e.g. the introduction of additional temporal derivatives  @xcite or temporal constant delays  @xcite . however , propagation delays depend on the distance between two locations and thus represent space - dependent delays .",
    "in contrast to the pde formulation , a natural way to consider these delays are integral - differential equations ( ide ) which sum up all activity in a spatial domain and easily consider propagation delay , see e.g.  @xcite . moreover , the strong connection between pde and ide models is well - known  @xcite .",
    "the present work proposes a novel ide model involving finite propagation delays which generalizes well - studied pde models in one spatial dimension , namely the reaction - diffusion models , the swift - hohenberg model and the kuramoto - sivashinsky model .",
    "moreover re - calling the mathematical description of neuronal populations by ides , the proposed model represents a generic pattern forming model with a vast range of possible applications . + in addition to the generalization described above , the novel ide model allows for the extension of pde models in order to consider propagation delay effects .",
    "the present work shows that the results obtained in ide models involving finite propagation speeds can be applied easily to pde models .",
    "hence this work extends previous studies  @xcite as it clearly distinguishes local dynamics from nonlocal spatial interactions and elicits the strong connection between well - known pde - models of pattern forming systems and the ide models in neural field theory  @xcite .",
    "we derive novel extensions of the diffusion equation , the swift - hohenberg equation ( she ) and the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation now involving finite propagation speeds .",
