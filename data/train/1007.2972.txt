    "this special hardware , called non - abelian topological matter , has been proposed to exist in certain classes of two - dimensional ( 2d ) strongly - correlated systems , such as the @xmath2 fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) system moore91,nayak96,read00,sarma05,stern06,bonderson06,rosenow08 , chiral _",

    "the ground state wave function is a linear combination of states from a degenerate subspace , and a pair - wise exchange of the particle coordinates unitarily rotates the ground state wave function in this subspace .",
    "therefore , the exchange statistics of the particles is given by a multi - dimensional unitary matrix representation ( as opposed to just a phase factor for bosons and fermions ) of the 2d braid group , and the statistics is non - abelian .    despite the tremendous technological potential ,",
    "non - abelian topological matter is rare in nature and generally hard to observe in experiments nayakrmp . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "there has been considerable interests recently for exploring the possibility of ` designing ' non - abelian topological order in the fertile laboratory of the cold atom systems zhang08,sato09 and the regular solid state materials fu08,fu09,akhmerov09,fu10,sau10,stanescu10,lee09,qi10,tewari10,alicea10,sau102,sau103,sau104,sau105,linder .",
    "two important resources for the emergence of non - abelian statistics in a correlated matter are ( a ) chirality of the constituent particles and ( b ) superconducting order . in a composite system , these two basic ingredients of topological order may arise from two different physical effects ( for instance , spin - orbit coupling and _ s_-wave superconductivity , respectively ) to design a non - abelian quantum state .",
    "this strategy allows us to use _ s_-wave superconductors / superfluids , which are much more abundant in nature and much less sensitive to disorder effects than their _ p_-wave counterparts .",
    "one important recent progress along this direction was the proposed solid state heterostructure composed of an electron - doped semiconductor thin film , an _",
    "s_-wave superconductor , and a magnetic insulator as a non - abelian platform for tqc @xcite . in this heterostructure ,",
    "the superconducting pairing order is induced on the semiconductor thin film from the _ s_-wave superconductor through the superconducting proximity effect , and the chirality of particles is supplied by the rashba spin - orbit coupling in the semiconductor @xcite . with a set of vortices in the heterostructure ,",
    "there exist one majorana zero energy state of quasiparticle excitations in each vortex core .",
    "these zero energy states are the topological , degenerate , ground states following non - abelian statistics and can be used to perform tqc .",
    "in addition to the existence of majorana zero energy modes , another key ingredient for the physical implementation of tqc is that the degenerate ground state subspace must be separated from other non - topological excited states by an energy gap , so that finite temperature can not populate the excited states and ruin the topological properties of the system .",
    "recently , it was shown@xcite , by constructing a new type of majorana operators that contain both zero energy and excited states , that the topological braiding statistics of majorana fermions may still preserve even in the presence of non - topological excitations . however , the minigap is still important because the signal strengths of measurements will be reduced significantly when the temperature is comparable with the minigap where the number of non - topological excitations become significant .",
    "the magnitude of the energy gap directly determines the operating temperature of the underlying physical system as a realistic tqc platform and is of critical importance .",
    "furthermore , both majorana zero energy states and the magnitude of the gap must be robust in the presence of various impurities .",
    "although the existence of majorana zero energy states in the vortex core in a heterostructure has been proved by analyzing the zero energy solution of the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) equation , the magnitudes of the minimum energy gaps and their robustness against impurities have not been addressed .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically solve the bdg equation for a vortex in the heterostructure and calculate the minimum energy gap ( minigap ) between the zero energy state and the first quasiparticle excited state in the vortex core . in the simulation , the proximity - induced @xmath3-wave superconducting pairing gap @xmath0 in the semiconductor",
