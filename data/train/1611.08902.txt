    "the quantum dynamics of the radical - pair mechanism @xcite , underlying the avian magnetic compass @xcite and spin transport in photosynthetic reaction centers @xcite , have recently attracted the attention of the quantum physics community @xcite , since it was shown @xcite that radical - pairs offer an ideal system to study quantum coherence effects and explore quantum information processing in a complex biochemical setting .",
    "radical - pair reactions consist of a coherent spin motion in a multi - spin system embedded in a biomolecule , interrupted by an electron transfer that results in the spin - dependent charge recombination of the radical - ion - pair and the termination of the reaction .",
    "it is known that the coherent spin motion as well as the measurable reaction yields in radical - pair reactions are also influenced by the external magnetic field through the unpaired electrons zeeman interaction .",
    "hence radical - pair reactions are no different than other quantum systems used to measure a classical parameter , as for example are the well - developed atomic magnetometers @xcite using e.g. alkali vapors @xcite or nitrogen vacancy centers @xcite .",
    "central in these studies have been the fundamental measurement precision limits set by the quantum dynamics of the system under consideration .",
    "we here establish a venue for studying quantum metrology in a biological context @xcite .",
    "we introduce the full machinery of quantum parameter estimation @xcite in order ( i ) to establish the _ exact _ value of @xmath0 , the fundamental magnetic sensitivity of the reaction , and ( ii ) design an optimal molecular system approaching this fundamental limit . to this end",
    "we consider the quantum fisher information obtained from the radical - pair reaction and the resulting cramr - rao bound .",
    "we then treat the intra - molecule hyperfine couplings as free design parameters , and obtain their optimum value by maximizing the quantum fisher information .",
    "this leads to the fundamental limit @xmath0 , which we explicitly derive for any radical - pair . knowing the absolute quantum limit on @xmath0 , we address the well - known measurement of reaction yields and show it is sub - optimal .",
    "we then modify a recently proposed method of reaction control @xcite , introducing a quantum circuit analysis of the controlled reaction , and reducing @xmath0 by a factor of 3 compared to @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the dynamics of radical - pair reactions , and in sec .",
    "iii the basic tools of quantum metrology , in particular the analytic form of the parameter - generator , a useful tool recently introduced @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , the eigenvalues of this operator are then used to find the maximum quantum fisher information and the resulting bounds on @xmath0 for radical - pair reactions .",
    "in sec . v we discuss a common observable in radical - pair reactions , the reaction yield , in the context of magnetic sensitivity .",
    "we demonstrate that the resulting maximum possible sensitivity is an order of magnitude smaller than the absolute quantum limit . in sec .",
    "vi we present the optimum measurement scheme that can realize the optimum quantum limit on @xmath0 .",
    "since this scheme does not appear to be chemically realistic , a natural question is whether some sort of quantum reaction control can improve the magnetic sensitivity of reaction yields .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in sec .",
    "vii , where we take advantage of the spin - exchange interaction naturally occurring in radical - pairs , and known from quantum metrology work to simulate a controlled - not gate .",
    "the spin - exchange interaction effects a state - preparation and readout before and after the actual magnetometric state evolution , respectively , reminding of ramsey interferometry .",
    "together with the reaction control method of @xcite , which is a factor of 6 away from the absolute quantum limit , our measurement scheme is shown to approach this limit within a factor of 2 .",
    "radical - pairs ( rps ) are the cornerstone system of spin chemistry , the field of physical chemistry and photochemistry dealing with the effect of electron and nuclear spins on chemical reactions .",
    "the radical - pair mechanism was introduced by closs and closs @xcite and by kaptein and oosterhoff @xcite as a reaction intermediate explaining anomalously large epr and nmr signals observed in organic molecule reactions in the 1960 s .",
    "the quantum degrees of freedom of radical - ion pairs are formed by a multi - spin system embedded in a biomolecule .",
    "the multi - spin system is comprised of the two unpaired electrons of the two radical - ions and a usually large number of nuclei .",
    "their coherent spin motion is driven by intramolecule magnetic interactions , as for example hyperfine couplings between each radical s magnetic nuclei and the respective unpaired electron .",
    "the magnetic field effects resulting from such interactions in this spin - dependent biochemical reaction have been extensively explored theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "in particular , a charge transfer following the photoexcitation of a donor - acceptor dyad da leads to the radical - pair ( also called charge - separated state ) @xmath1 , where the two dots represent the two unpaired electron spins of the two radicals .",
    "the initial spin state of the two unpaired electrons of the radical - pair is usually a singlet , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "now , both d and a contain a number of magnetic nuclei which hyperfine - couple to the respective electron .",
    "neither singlet - state nor triplet - state rps are eigenstates of the magnetic hamiltonian , @xmath3 , hence the initial formation of @xmath2 is followed by singlet - triplet ( s - t ) mixing , i.e. a coherent oscillation of the spin state of the electrons , designated by @xmath4 .",
    "concomitantly , nuclear spins also precess , and hence the total electron / nuclear spin system undergoes a coherent spin motion driven by @xmath3 . as will be detailed later , the subscript @xmath5 in @xmath3 is a reminder that the hamiltonian depends parametrically on the magnetic field @xmath5 to be estimated .",
    "this coherent spin motion has a finite lifetime .",
    "charge recombination , i.e. charge transfer from a back to d , terminates the reaction and leads to the formation of the neutral reaction products , conserving during the process the electronic angular momentum .",
    "that is , there are two kinds of neutral products , singlet ( the original da molecules ) and triplet , @xmath6da .",
    "the percentage of the initial radical - pair population ending up in the singlet ( triplet ) neutral product defines the singlet ( triplet ) reaction yield .",
    "singlet and triplet recombination takes place at the rate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "both rates are in principle known parameters of the specific molecular system under consideration , as of course are the hyperfine couplings entering @xmath3 .",
    "the whole process is schematically depicted in fig.[schematic]a .    , which is coherently converted to the triplet radical - pair , @xmath9 , due to intramolecule magnetic interactions embodied in the spin hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "simultaneously , spin - selective charge recombination leads to singlet ( da ) and triplet neutral products ( @xmath6da ) .",
    "( b ) quantum metrology aspect of the radical - pair reaction , where an initial spin state is transformed into a final spin state , which depends on the magnetic field @xmath5 through the spin hamiltonian .",
    "the measurement of the final state conveys information about @xmath5 . ]    the schematic of fig.[schematic]a should not be taken too literally , as it suggests that only pure singlet ( triplet ) radical - pairs can recombine to the singlet ( triplet ) neutral reaction products .",
    "this is not the case , like it is not the case for a two - level atom that only an excited - state atom can decay to the ground state . as in atoms having ground - excited state coherence , radical - pairs",
    "can be in coherent superpositions of singlet and triplet states , continuously evolving by @xmath3 .",
    "a major aspect of our previous work has been to understand the physics of this coherence , its fundamental dissipation properties , and the role thereof in establishing the fundamental master equation , @xmath10 , accounting for the radical - pair reaction s quantum dynamics .",
    "this issue is still hotly debated @xcite .",
    "this work , however , is decoupled from this debate , as we consider only the hamiltonian contribution to the quantum metrology aspect of the reaction .",
    "the non - trivial quantum dynamics previously alluded to mainly appear in the case of unequal recombination rates , @xmath11 .",
    "here we consider the simple exponential model , where @xmath12 and we further neglect the presence of s - t decoherence @xcite , which is unavoidable even in the case @xmath13 .",
    "the rationale of this approach is that it allows a step - wise understanding of the quantum metrology aspect of radical - pair reactions , starting from the most evident features stemming from the coherent spin motion , and progressing to more complex properties of the system , which is an open and leaky quantum system .",
    "earlier works @xcite attempted to explore some metrological aspects of these reactions , however using the traditional ( called haberkorn s ) master equation and considering phenomenological sources of decoherence .",
    "our understanding is ( i ) that haberkorn s master equation scrambles the quantum dynamics of the system and is a phenomenological description valid only in the regime of strong spin relaxation , and ( ii ) consideration of decoherence and its role in this new kind of biochemical quantum metrology is a non - trivial task , intertwined with the understanding of the fundamental master equation .",
    "therefore we opt to first establish the fundamental limits to the magnetic sensitivity of radical - pair reactions in the simple case of equal recombination rates and a purely coherent spin motion .",
    "thus , the only effect of the finite radical - pair s lifetime @xmath14 relevant to this work is that the radical - pair population decays exponentially as @xmath15 .",
    "hence the sensitivity limit @xmath0 @xcite will be shown to be directly dependent on @xmath16 .",
    "this is not unexpected , since measurement time is a central resource in quantum metrology .",
    "in other words , we here explore the equivalence of fig.[schematic]a with fig.[schematic]b , which describes the usual scheme of quantum estimating a classical parameter like a magnetic field .",
    "an initial state @xmath17 evolves under the unitary action of the hamiltonian @xmath3 into @xmath18 . measuring the final state conveys information about @xmath5 . in radical - pair reactions , an initial spin state ( comprising",
    "the spin of the two electrons and the present nuclei ) evolves under @xmath3 , and the recombination process effects the measurement in the singlet / triplet basis , i.e. the measurement stage is naturally inbuilt into the radical - pair mechanism .",
    "we here treat radical - pair reactions as scalar magnetometers , and conclusively address the questions : ( a ) what is the fundamental quantum limit , @xmath0 , to the precision of estimating @xmath5 ?",
    "( b ) is this limit realized when the physical observable carrying the information on @xmath5 is the reaction yield ?",
    "( c ) if not , can we control the reaction in order to better approach the fundamental limit @xmath0 ?      if we consider a radical - pair with @xmath19 nuclear spins in the donor and @xmath20 nuclear spins in the acceptor , the hyperfine hamiltonian in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath21 , where @xmath5 is to be estimated , is _",
    "b =- b(s_dz+s_az)+_j=1^n_d_d_j_j+_k=1^n_a_a_k_k.[ham ] here we denote by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) the electron spin of the donor ( acceptor ) radical , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the @xmath26-th ( @xmath27-th ) nuclear spin of the donor ( acceptor ) radical , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) the hyperfine tensor coupling the @xmath26-th ( @xmath27-th ) nuclear spin of the donor ( acceptor ) radical to the donor s ( acceptor s ) electron . the gyromagnetic ratio of the electrons setting the frequency scale , @xmath30 , has been set to @xmath31 in eq . and",
    "we will keep this convention from now on .",
    "we also set @xmath32 , thus the hyperfine couplings and the magnetic field @xmath5 have units of frequency , while the spin operators are dimensionless . in the following , in order to get actual magnetic field values , one should divide the derived expressions for @xmath5 with @xmath33 .    before embarking on our analysis",
    ", we will first lay out the tools of quantum parameter estimation and apply them to two pedagogical cases , a single electron zeeman interaction and a two - electron zeeman interaction .",
    "these considerations will form a baseline for comparing fundamental sensitivity limits in radical - pairs .",
    "the formalism developed by brun and coworkers @xcite is ideally suited to treat the estimation of @xmath5 , which is not a multiplicative parameter of the radical - pair hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , the authors in @xcite consider the time - evolution operator , @xmath34 , which obviously depends on the parameter @xmath5 we wish to estimate .",
    "if the initial state of the system is @xmath35 , then the time - evolved state will be @xmath36 , where the subscript in @xmath37 reminds us that the time evolved state also depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the generator of @xmath5 translations is then shown to be @xmath38 .",
    "the utility of this generator is that it directly leads to the _ maximum _ quantum fisher information f_b^max=[_max(h_b)-_min(h_b)]^2 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the maximum ( minimum ) eigenvalue of @xmath41 .",
    "the authors in @xcite then derive two general results .",
    "first , knowing the @xmath42 different eigenvalues , @xmath43 , and corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath44 of @xmath3 , where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the degeneracy of eigenvalue @xmath43 , one can obtain @xmath47 from @xmath48 by @xmath49 we denote the projector to the @xmath27-th eigenspace of @xmath3 . secondly , the maximum fisher information is obtained for the initial state = 1(+e^i),[opt_init ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the eigenkets of @xmath41 corresponding to its maximum and minimum eigenvalues , respectively . finally , the uncertainty @xmath0 in estimating @xmath5 is limited by the cramr - rao bound @xcite b,[dbfmax ] where @xmath52 is the number of independent repetitions ( number of radical - pairs in our case ) of the measurement .      before proceeding with radical - pairs ,",
    "we analyze two intuitive and simple examples .",
    "consider first a single electron in a magnetic field @xmath53 , the hamiltonian being @xmath54 .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . since the eigenvectors are @xmath5-independent , the second term in eq .",
    "is zero , while the first term leads to @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath41 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , hence @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we recover the well - known time - scaling limit , namely the magnetic sensitivity resulting from measuring the electron s larmor frequency during a time interval @xmath62 is limited by @xmath63 .",
    "repeating this measurement @xmath52 times , the so - called shot - noise limited sensitivity will be @xmath64 .",
    "we will now demonstrate the particle - number scaling limit by considering a 4-dimensional hamiltonian consisting of the zeeman interaction of two electrons , @xmath65 .",
    "now the eigenvalues are @xmath66 with corresponding eigenstate @xmath67 , @xmath68 with corresponding eigenstate @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , which is doubly degenerate , with corresponding eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 . again",
    ", the eigenstates are @xmath5-independent , hence @xmath73 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are @xmath74 , hence now it is @xmath75 .",
    "the magnetic sensitivity is now @xmath76 .",
    "this is @xmath77 times better than repeating the one - electron measurement two times .",
    "generalizing to an @xmath78-electron system , where @xmath79 , we find @xmath80 .",
    "this is @xmath81 times better than repeating the one - electron measurement @xmath78 times .",
    "this enhancement is due to a possible multi - partite entanglement in the @xmath78-electron state .",
    "that is , a notable feature of @xmath82 is that it automatically takes into account of such a possibility in the system s state preparation .",
    "it should be noted that the scaling with the particle number should not be confused with the scaling with the number @xmath52 of the experiment s repetition . since the experimental realizations are independent , the scaling with @xmath52 is the ordinary statistical scaling @xmath83 .",
    "that is , repeating the 2-electron measurement @xmath52 times , the so - called heisenberg limited magnetic sensitivity will be @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath78-electron system , the heisenberg - limited magnetic sensitivity obtained by averaging @xmath52 independent measurements will be @xmath85 .",
    "as shown previously with the simple scenario of free electrons in a magnetic field , the sensitivity @xmath0 depends on the measurement time @xmath62 . in radical - pair reactions there is a natural time scale limiting the magnetic sensitivity , the radical - pair s lifetime .",
    "this is determined by the recombination rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for the reasons outlined in sec .",
    "ii.a , we here consider the so - called exponential model , where @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath86 , the quantum dynamics of the radical - pair reaction simplify considerably .",
    "this is because , neglecting singlet - triplet decoherence which we understand is inherent in the system ( even when @xmath13 ) , in the exponential model radical - pairs can be considered to evolve unitarily by the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath3 , while their population decays exponentially at the rate @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently , at the single - molecule level , each radical - pair evolves unitarily until the random instant in time when it recombines .",
    "this time follows the exponential distribution @xmath87 , where @xmath14 .    since the quantum fisher information is time - dependent , we have to take into account the fact that from each radical - pair in the ensemble we can extract a different fisher information , depending on the time it recombined .",
    "if @xmath88 is the radical - pair population at time @xmath62 and @xmath89 is the initial population , then in each time interval @xmath90 there will be @xmath91 radical - pairs contributing to @xmath82 . if the variance of the magnetic field estimate resulting from one molecule is @xmath92 , then the @xmath91 molecules contribute independently to the measurement during @xmath90 .",
    "the inverse uncertainties of @xmath5 add in quadrature , hence the inverse variance stemming from those @xmath91 molecules will be @xmath93 . since @xmath94 , the magnetic sensitivity for the whole reaction is b=1.[delta_b_f ] clearly , we are not concerned with the absolute value of @xmath0 as determined by how many molecules participate in the experiment .",
    "we rather focus on optimizing @xmath82 , which depends on the state preparation and measurement scheme .",
    "thus , in the following we will take @xmath95 . for those cases where @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is some constant",
    ", it follows that @xmath98",
    ".    we will first derive exact analytic results for @xmath82 and @xmath0 for a radical - pair with one nuclear spin-1/2 contained in e.g. the donor . the hyperfine hamiltonian is _ b =- b(s_dz+s_az)+a_xs_dxi_x+a_ys_dyi_y+a_zs_dzi_z.as it formally turns out , the maximum quantum fisher information does not depend on @xmath99 . intuitively , this is because the term @xmath100 just produces a shift in the magnetic field `` seen '' by the electron spin @xmath101 along the z - axis and hence does not `` produce '' any information on @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore have to distinguish two cases : @xmath102 and @xmath103 . after dealing with the single - nuclear - spin radical - pair",
    ", we generalize to multiple nuclear spins .      for the spheroidal hyperfine coupling it",
    "b =- b(s_dz+s_az)+as_dxi_x+as_dyi_y+as_dzi_z . a special case , occurring when @xmath104 , is the commonly encountered isotropic hyperfine coupling .",
    "the eight eigenvalues of @xmath3 are given in appendix a , along with the eigenvalues of @xmath41 calculated from eq . .",
    "it is found that the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath41 are @xmath62 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "hence in this case , the maximum quantum fisher information is @xmath75 , leading to the quantum limit b_f=1.[deltab_f ] : the minimum uncertainty , @xmath0 , for determining a magnetic field @xmath5 by using a radical - ion - pair reaction , the single nuclear spin of the radical - pair having a spheroidal hyperfine coupling , is given by eq . .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the maximum fisher information , @xmath106 , is the same with the case of two free electrons studied in section iii.b .",
    "one would perhaps expect that having three particles in the system ( two electrons and one nucleus ) , the optimal sensitivity should gain ( according to the heisenberg scaling ) a factor of 3 compared to the single - electron case , or a factor of 3/2 compared to the two - electron case .",
    "the reason behind the absence of such enhancement is that the nuclear spin does not strongly couple to the magnetic field .",
    "hence it does not provide any independent information on the magnetic field , but only serves to drive the time evolution of the radical - pair s electronic spin state .",
    "the lack of enhancement by the nuclear spin is not because we omitted the nuclear zeeman interaction in the hamiltonian . indeed ,",
    "if we include the nuclear zeeman term in @xmath3 , we find that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio ( scaled to @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus the correction to @xmath109 is on the order of @xmath110 and hence negligible .",
    "however , if it were @xmath111 , then we would get the expected factor of 3 in sensitivity gain compared to the single - electron case of sec .",
    "iii.a . in other words ,",
    "the information about the magnetic field essentially stems from the strength of the field s coupling to the spins .",
    "we will now consider the general hyperfine coupling , where @xmath103 , _ b =- b(s_dz+s_az)+a_xs_dxi_x+a_ys_dyi_y+as_dzi_z .",
    "again , we can find analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath41 , which are given in appendix b. there it is shown that @xmath112 and @xmath113 , hence the resulting maximum quantum fisher information is bound by @xmath106 , which we found previously for the spheroidal hyperfine coupling .",
    "* we thus arrive at our second general result * : for a radical - pair with a single nuclear spin-1/2 , the spheroidal hyperfine coupling ( the isotropic being a special case ) leads to the smallest uncertainty , @xmath0 , for determining a magnetic field @xmath5 along the spheroid s symmetry axis .",
    "this uncertainty depends only on the radical - pair s lifetime @xmath16 , and is given by @xmath114 . as a numerical estimate , for @xmath115 and @xmath116 radical - pairs",
    "we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "radical - pairs contain many ( sometimes tens ) of nuclear spins .",
    "based on the above , we can readily generalize and state * the third general result of this work * : for any radical - pair with a spin - independent lifetime ( i.e. @xmath118 ) , the maximum magnetic sensitivity ( minimum @xmath0 ) that can be obtained with _ any measurement method and any initial state _ is @xmath119 .",
    "this follows from the same physical argument used in sec .",
    "iv.a , namely that the uncertainty @xmath0 is determined just by the two electron spins .",
    "the nuclear spins do not couple to the external magnetic field , i.e. they are spectators just driving the spin state evolution .",
    "a formal proof of this general result follows . for any operator",
    "@xmath120 depending parametrically on @xmath5 , it is @xcite @xmath121 .",
    "we take @xmath122 , calculate the above derivative with @xmath5 and multiply with @xmath123 in order to find @xmath124 .",
    "taking the operator norm we get @xmath125 , hence indeed the maximum ( minimum ) eigenvalue of @xmath41 is smaller ( larger ) or equal than @xmath62 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "typically , when studying the magnetic sensitivity of radical - pair reactions , one considers the singlet reaction yield , which quantifies the percentage of the reactants ( number of radical - pairs starting out in the electronic singlet state at @xmath126 ) ending up in the singlet neutral product state . to define the singlet reaction yield ,",
    "@xmath127 , we first need to introduce two basic operators , the singlet and triplet projectors , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . for a radical - pair with a single nuclear spin they are written as @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "they leave the nuclear spin state untouched and project out of a general state @xmath132 the electronic singlet or triplet component .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath128 in the state @xmath132 is thus @xmath133 , hence the singlet reaction yield is written as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",
    "it is obviously irrelevant whether one chooses to measure the singlet or the triplet reaction yield , since it is always @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "now , since the magnetic field enters @xmath138 through the hamiltonian , the reaction yield is a function of @xmath5 . in particular , in order to find the magnetic sensitivity @xmath0 , we first need to distinguish two cases .",
    "( a ) if one can measure the instantaneous singlet yield given by @xmath139 , one can estimate @xmath5 just from those radical - pairs that recombined into the singlet channel during @xmath90 through the relation @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the variance of @xmath128 at time @xmath62 , and @xmath142 is the magnetic sensitivity of the instantaneous yield .",
    "all such estimates can then be statistically combined ( inverse uncertainties add in quadrature ) to yield the total uncertainty b=^-1/2,[dbin ] where in the expression for the variance of @xmath128 appearing in the denominator of the integrand in eq .",
    "we took into account that @xmath143 , since @xmath128 is a projector .",
    "for this measurement scheme to be realistic , the time resolution of the measurement of the instantaneous yield must be much better than @xmath144 .",
    "if this is not the case , we are led to case ( b ) integration over the whole reaction , i.e. measurement of the total yield @xmath127 .",
    "then the magnetic sensitivity @xmath0 is given by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the precision with which @xmath127 is measured .",
    "this is calculated as follows . in each time",
    "step @xmath90 , the instantaneous yield , proportional to @xmath147 , is a random variable following a binomial distribution with probability @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the total yield follows the sum of binomials having different probabilities , which is the poisson binomial distribution .",
    "its variance is @xmath148 , hence b=^1/2.[dbav ]    it is expected that the magnetic sensitivity of case ( b ) is smaller than case ( a ) , or equivalently @xmath149 , since in case ( a ) we have access to much more information along the reaction than the integrated yield relevant to case ( b ) .",
    "nevertheless , we here opt to provide exact expressions for @xmath0 in the integrated case , as we think that this is most relevant for physiological conditions . for completeness",
    ", we then report the corresponding sensitivities for case ( a ) .",
    "we first consider an isotropic hyperfine hamiltonian , @xmath150 .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 for initial state ( i ) @xmath151 , ( ii ) @xmath152 , and ( iii ) an equal mixture of ( i ) and ( ii ) , which is usually taken to describe the initial state of radical - pair reactions , as it accounts for thermal equilibrium ( practically zero ) nuclear spin polarization .",
    "we denote the respective uncertainties by @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the analytic expressions for these uncertainties follow from the analytic expressions for the reaction yields @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 and their derivatives with respect to @xmath5 entering the denominator of eq . , as well as from the analytic expressions for the respective nominators .",
    "the resulting formulas are too cumbersome to list here . in appendix c",
    "we provide for reference the exact expressions for the reaction yields .",
    "we here use the obtained analytic expressions for the uncertainties @xmath0 to display their inverses as a function of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath5 and @xmath159 in the contour plots of fig.[db](a)-(c ) for the cases ( i)-(iii ) , respectively .",
    "we first note that the minimum of @xmath154 ( see fig.[db]b ) is smaller by about 30% than the minimum of @xmath153 ( see fig.[db]a ) , and both minima appear at a finite ( and different in each case ) value of the hyperfine coupling @xmath159 and at a different field @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the different singlet - triplet mixing frequencies caused by the nuclear spin in the @xmath160 or in the @xmath161 state . in the @xmath161 state",
    "the nuclear magnetic field opposes @xmath5 and hence reduces the mixing frequency , thus its @xmath5-dependence becomes relatively more significant .    in case ( iii ) , shown in fig.[db]c , the minimum of @xmath155 is achieved for @xmath162 .",
    "although the sensitivity @xmath163 is linear in the density matrix , the magnetic sensitivity @xmath0 depends on the absolute value of @xmath163 , hence @xmath155 is not trivially related to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "for example , at low @xmath5 and @xmath159 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are close to their minimum , the respective derivatives @xmath163 are opposite in sign , and this is why @xmath155 is large in this region .    in any case , taking the limit of large @xmath159 we find the exact expression b_s^iso(b)^1/2.the minimum occurs at @xmath164 and takes the value b_s^iso=5.14.[dbs ] : for a radical - pair with one isotropically coupled nuclear spin , the maximum possible magnetic sensitivity obtained by measuring the time - integrated reaction yield is 15 times lower , @xmath165 , than the highest possible sensitivity allowed by quantum physics and given by eq . .",
    "this means that there is ample room for improvement .      by changing to an anisotropic hyperfine interaction",
    "we can already get about a factor of 2 improvement in @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we repeat the calculation for @xmath0 taking @xmath166 .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is minimized either for @xmath167 and @xmath168 or for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "for both cases the minimum is the same for both initial states ( i ) @xmath151 and ( ii ) @xmath152 , and hence the same for ( iii ) the mixed singlet initial state .",
    "this is expected , since both pure initial states are symmetric with respect to the hamiltonian anisotropy .",
    "we thus denote the uncertainty common to all three initial states ( i)-(iii ) by @xmath171 . as in the isotropic case ,",
    "the resulting expressions are long . in appendix c",
    "we provide for reference the reaction yield .",
    "as shown in fig.[db]d , @xmath172 increases with increasing @xmath159 .",
    "like before , we take the limit @xmath162 and find b_s^aniso(b)^1/2.the minimum occurs at @xmath173 , and takes the value b_s^aniso=2.27 , which is still a factor of 6.4 away from @xmath174 . * to summarize our fifth main result * : the measurement of the integrated reaction yield can at best provide 6.4 times worse magnetic sensitivity than the absolute quantum limit , and this is achieved for the maximally anisotropic hyperfine interaction .",
    "the reason the anisotropic coupling outperforms the isotropic in the reaction yield magnetic sensitivity will be given in sec .",
    "vi.a after we introduce the optimal measurement strategy .",
    "furthermore , we stress that for a given magnetic field @xmath5 to be estimated , the optimum reaction - yield sensitivity @xmath0 is obtained for a particular lifetime of the radical - pair on the order of @xmath175 .",
    "the reason will be given in sec .",
    "vii.c .    for completeness",
    ", we produce in figs.[db]e , f the results of eq . , i.e. the case when our measurement time resolution is enough to monitor the instantaneous yield along the reaction .",
    "in both cases studied , isotropic and anisotropic , this kind of measurement yields about a factor of 2 improvement in magnetic sensitivity .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath176 and @xmath177 , obtained for @xmath162 at @xmath178 .",
    "moreover , both minimums become broader , i.e. there is a larger range of @xmath5 values close to the optimal @xmath0 .",
    "the usual measurement scheme of radical - pair reactions , namely the singlet initial state and the measurement of the singlet reaction yield , is enforced by the very nature of these reactions .",
    "as shown in the previous section , this measurement is sub - optimal . towards a possible improvement in magnetic sensitivity",
    ", we first need to point to the optimal initial state and the optimal measurement operator . according to the general result of eq . , the optimal initial state for a single - nuclear spin radical - pair is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state @xmath179 .",
    "clearly , @xmath17 belongs to the triplet manifold , and exhibits maximum tri - partite entanglement .",
    "it is expected that by measuring the electronic spin precession of this state in the magnetic field one would obtain the optimum sensitivity . indeed , for the isotropic hyperfine hamiltonian , which we know already is optimal ( see section iv.a ) , the time - evolved state ( taking @xmath180 ) is @xmath181 .",
    "we choose @xcite as measurement operator @xmath182 .",
    "we will now analyze the two scenarios mentioned in section v , that of a time - resolved measurement and that of an integrated measurement . in the former case we get @xmath183 , hence @xmath184 .",
    "now during @xmath90 there will be @xmath185 molecules contributing to this measurement of @xmath186 .",
    "the resulting inverse variance in @xmath5 is @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the variance of @xmath186 .",
    "thus we find @xmath189 , which is exactly equal to the maximum quantum fisher information , leading to @xmath190 .",
    "it thus follows that with this measurement strategy one achieves the limit @xmath174 at any @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , an integrated measurement is not as capable .",
    "now the integrated @xmath186-``yield '' is @xmath191 , and its magnetic sensitivity is @xmath192 .",
    "the square error in @xmath193 will be the integrated variance of @xmath186 , weighted by the exponential population decay , i.e. @xmath194^{1/2}=[8b^2/(16b^2+k^2)]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "finally , the magnetic sensitivity will be @xmath195^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath196 , with the equality sign valid only for @xmath197 .",
    "that is , in the integrated measurement with the optimal initial state and optimal measurement operator we achieve the optimal sensitivity only at @xmath197 .",
    "the optimum magnetic sensitivity follows from the optimal measurement strategy outlined before , choosing as initial state a maximally entangled state of the triplet electronic manifold , and measuring its spin coherence while it is evolving , always within the triplet manifold .",
    "clearly , this is far from how radical - pairs evolve in reality .",
    "this leads to a natural question that we will affirmatively address in the following section , i.e. can we control the reaction in a chemically and physically realistic way in order to approach the optimum magnetic sensitivity ?      before addressing the previous question",
    ", we will explain the fact that the maximally anisotropic hyperfine interaction gives a factor of 2 improvement in @xmath0 , as was demonstrated in sec .",
    "this can be seen to result from the overlap of the state evolved by the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath3 , which is @xmath198 , with the optimal state @xmath199 previously defined . for the isotropic",
    "hamiltonian the overlap is zero , while for the anisotropic hamiltonian it is @xmath200 .",
    "finally , it might sound as contradicting that on the one hand we obtain the maximum fisher information for the isotropic case , while the maximum _ reaction - yield _ magnetic sensitivity for the anisotropic case .",
    "the latter finding does not contradict the former , as the _ reaction - yield _ sensitivity limit is well below the quantum limit defined by the fisher information .",
    "in section v we have rigorously proved that the singlet reaction yield with a maximally anisotropic hyperfine interaction can at most provide a magnetic sensitivity 6.4 times worse than the absolute quantum limit .",
    "a natural question is , how can one do better ?",
    "in particular , given the discussion of the previous section , how can one do better in a chemically realistic way ?",
    "towards addressing this question we will ( i ) take advantage of a very promising approach of optically switching the conformation of the radical - pair , recently proposed in @xcite , and ( ii ) include a realistic exchange interaction in the hamiltonian , which changes ( a ) the initial spin state before the radical - pair commences its magnetometric state evolution , and ( b ) the effective measurement basis before it recombines .        in summary ,",
    "given the maximally anisotropic coupling that resulted from the optimization of section v.c , the reaction control proposed in @xcite , and the modified initial state and measurement basis we introduce in the following , we will show that the obtained sensitivity @xmath0 is just a factor 2 away from the quantum limit @xmath174 of eq . .",
    "moreover , compared to the approach of @xcite , we reduce @xmath0 by a factor of 3 .      ,",
    "where @xmath201 , for a mixed singlet initial state @xmath202 , and ( a ) an isotropic and ( c ) a maximally anisotropic hyperfine interaction . in ( b ) and ( d ) we depict the corresponding probability per unit time , @xmath203 , for the molecular switches to close by the reaction control laser pulses , which are tuned to coincide with the positive swings of @xmath204 . in the middle of trace ( b )",
    "there are a number of pulses missing , since there the corresponding @xmath204 is on average zero and hence will not contribute to the singlet yield magnetic sensitivity .",
    "for all plots it was @xmath205 and @xmath206.,width=6 ]        we briefly reiterate the method of @xcite , since the added advantage we introduce by the exchange hamiltonian is based on the same method of optically pulsing the conformation of the radical - pair .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite suggest binding the donor and acceptor parts of the radical - pair to the two ends of a molecular switch , the conformation of which can be laser controlled .",
    "schematically , this is shown in fig.[rc ] . the rationale behind this idea is the following .",
    "as shown previously , the magnetic sensitivity depends on @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the so - called singlet fidelity of the radical - pair state at time @xmath62 , and @xmath159 , @xmath5 the hyperfine coupling and the magnetic field . for reference ,",
    "the functions @xmath204 are given in appendix d for the hamiltonians considered in this work . in fig.[pm]a",
    "we plot an example of @xmath209 , which is seen to be symmetric about zero .",
    "thus , when integrated with the exponential population decay , @xmath210 , and the lifetime @xmath144 is long enough to contain many positive and negative swings of @xmath211 , magnetic sensitivity is suppressed .    the idea of @xcite is to pulse the conformation of the molecular switch by an external laser .",
    "when the switch is open , the radical - pair evolves unitarily by the magnetic hamiltonian , which for later use we call @xmath212 .",
    "for example , this would be either @xmath213 for the isotropic or @xmath214 for the anisotropic case . when the switch is closed , the authors in @xcite argue , the short distance between d and a will turn on the exchange interaction @xcite , @xmath215 . for large exchange coupling @xmath216 ,",
    "pertinent to the small d - a separation at the closed switch position , the singlet and triplet energy levels separate by @xmath216 and singlet - triplet mixing is suppressed , so only recombination can take place . if the reaction control laser in turned on at those instances ( fig.[pm]b ) where @xmath211 is positive ( and does not have fast oscillations , as in the middle part of fig.[pm]a ) , then the reaction yield magnetic sensitivity will be enhanced , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the @xmath217 modulation that can be externally controlled by the reaction control laser pulses , we now analyze our measurement scheme approaching the absolute quantum limit @xmath174 . as shown in fig.[scheme ] , we first prepare the radical - pair state in the electron singlet state .",
    "the nuclear spin is usually in an equal mixture of the states @xmath160 and @xmath161 . towards better exhibiting the connection of this biochemical reaction with quantum metrology ,",
    "we take the quantum circuit perspective and depict the electron singlet state as produced from @xmath218 by a hadamard gate followed by a controlled - not gate . in radical - pairs , this state preparation is naturally realized by the electron transfer producing the charge separated state , since the precursor neutral molecule is already in the singlet state . at @xmath126",
    "all molecular switches are in the `` closed '' conformation and the radical - pairs in the state @xmath219 , which describes a singlet state for the electrons and a mixed state for the nuclear spin .",
    "now , while the authors in @xcite open the switch at this time , using a laser pulse strong enough to open all molecular switches , we wait for a time @xmath220 and act on the initial state with the hamiltonian @xmath221 . while the authors in @xcite consider an exchange coupling @xmath216 too large to allow any s - t mixing , we take @xmath216 to be a finite optimization parameter . we thus take @xmath222 .",
    "the duration @xmath220 of the action of @xmath221 is a free parameter , however constrained by @xmath223 , so that the radical - pairs do nt have enough time to recombine through the singlet channel .",
    "essentially , the action of @xmath221 for a time @xmath220 prepares the initial state of the radical - pair in a state other than @xmath35 . at time",
    "@xmath224 a strong reaction control laser pulse opens all molecular switches , and the two radicals are now far apart , so that @xmath225 is a good approximation , given the exponential dependence of @xmath216 on inter - radical distance @xcite . from @xmath224 until @xmath226 the hamiltonian @xmath212 effects the singlet - triplet conversion forming the main magnetometric state evolution . at time @xmath226",
    "a weak reaction control laser pulse closes some of the switches .",
    "the pulse energy is chosen so that the rate of closing is equal to the radical - recombination rate @xmath27 .",
    "this pulse is the first pulse shown in the pulse sequence of fig.[pm]d . now in our model , the hamiltonian @xmath221 will act again until the radical - pairs of those switches that closed recombine . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the radical - pairs just recombine at some time after the switches close without any state evolution taking place before recombination .",
    "the radical - pairs of those switches that did not close in step 3 continue to evolve under @xmath212 .",
    "step 3 is then repeated with the next weak reaction control pulse , and so on .",
    "thus , the pulse repetition period is @xmath227 , which is the envelope period of the function @xmath209 shown in fig.[pm]c , while the pulse width is @xmath228 , so that only the positive swings of @xmath209 contribute to the yield s magnetic sensitivity .",
    "hence for any given radical - pair , the time @xmath229 during which @xmath212 is acting is some odd multiple of @xmath228 , plus the time within the pulse , at which this radical - pair recombines .",
    "the magnetic sensitivity resulting from the quantum circuit of fig.[scheme ] is shown in fig.[result ] in two equivalent ways . in fig.[result]a",
    "we plot the yield sensitivity @xmath230 , in order to directly compare with the result of @xcite . in fig.[result]b",
    "we plot the absolute value of @xmath0 , normalized to the optimum quantum limit @xmath114 .",
    "it is evident that ( a ) the choice of the maximally anisotropic hamiltonian and ( b ) the inclusion of the action of the exchange interaction in @xmath221 leads to an enhancement by a factor of 3 compared to @xcite , and puts the scheme of fig.[scheme ] a factor of 2 away from the absolute quantum limit .",
    "the factor of 3 is equally attributed to ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of the enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by the exchange interaction is the initial phase difference between the singlet and triplet states resulting from the initial action of @xmath221 . due to this phase difference",
    ", the action of @xmath212 fully transforms the @xmath231 into a @xmath232 state , thus sensitively affecting the results of the recombination measurement . without this phase , i.e. setting @xmath233 , the singlet and triplet states both have significant populations at the end of the circuit and dilute the magnetic sensitivity of the recombination products .",
    "our quantum circuit scheme of fig.[scheme ] reminds of ramsey spectroscopy , where an initial @xmath234 pulse produces an atomic hyperfine coherence , which evolves under the clock transition hyperfine hamiltonian , and is refocused by the final @xmath234 pulse . to further clarify the workings of this quantum reaction control the following remarks are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) the pulse sequence of the reaction control laser shown in fig.[pm]d is synchronized with the positive swings of @xmath204 shown in fig.[pm]c .",
    "this necessitates some prior ( and approximate ) knowledge of the magnetic field , a feature common with the reaction control scheme of @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the time interval @xmath220 during which @xmath221 acts before the molecular switch opens is taken @xmath235 , so that radical - pair recombination is negligible ( it actually increases the obtained @xmath0 by 5% ) .",
    "after the switch closes , @xmath221 acts for time @xmath236 before the radical - pairs recombine .",
    "this time is taken to follow the exponential distribution with parameter @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath221 acts for a time as long as the radical - pair takes to recombine on average , i.e. @xmath237 .",
    "\\(3 ) the inclusion of @xmath238 , which includes the exchange interaction was motivated by ( i ) other works @xcite , where a controlled - not gate is shown to be a crucial element in metrology , and ( ii ) the fact that the controlled - not gate is naturally realized by the exchange interaction , as analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we let the exchange coupling @xmath216 be a free optimization parameter .",
    "the minimum @xmath0 was found for @xmath239 . for a typical hyperfine coupling @xmath159 of several gauss ,",
    "the resulting value of @xmath216 is also on the order of several gauss .",
    "now , @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the donor - acceptor distance , and typical values @xcite of @xmath242 and @xmath243 are @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath216 to be on the order of several gauss , the distance @xmath241 in the closed position of the switch must be around 1.8 nm .",
    "this is quite larger than the d - a distance of 0.5 nm in the closed position of azobenzene @xcite , proposed in @xcite as a molecular switch .",
    "so for the reaction control studied here azobenzene is not an ideal candidate .",
    "furthermore , in fig.[result]c we plot the minimum value of the obtained sensitivity , @xmath246 ( i.e. the minimum of the red solid trace of fig.[result]b ) as a function of the exchange coupling @xmath216 .",
    "however , as the exchange coupling depends on inter - radical separation , which is modulated by molecular vibrations , in reality we have to average the trace of fig.[result]c .",
    "indeed , evaluating @xmath240 around @xmath247 , and taking a variation of @xmath241 by 0.05 nm , which is typical for studies on the relaxation effect of @xmath216-modulation due to molecular vibrations @xcite , leads to a factor of 2 change in @xmath216 , similar to the @xmath216-range of fig.[result]c .",
    "we thus obtain a final @xmath248 , i.e. 10% higher than the value for a constant ( and optimum ) @xmath216 .",
    "\\(4 ) further , there are two points that might cause a misunderstanding .",
    "we first note that although the reaction control pulse sequence introduces a timing in the measurement of reaction yields , the measurement is not of the instantaneous type described in sec .",
    "v.a , since we still measure an integrated yield , as does the scheme in @xcite .",
    "secondly , the reader might argue that we use an exchange interaction , which was absent in the optimization presented in secs .",
    "iv and v. however , the exchange interaction is used in @xmath221 , which is just a state - preparation process , changing the initial singlet state and the final measurement basis .",
    "we thus engineer an initial state which is more optimal than @xmath35 , and the actual magnetometry takes place during the action of @xmath212 , which does not include any spin exchange .    , and ( b ) error @xmath0 in the estimation of the magnetic field , normalized by the absolute quantum limit @xmath114 .",
    "the black dashed line reproduces the result of the reaction control scheme of @xcite , while the red solid line is the result of this work .",
    "our reaction control scheme approaches @xmath114 within a factor of 2 .",
    "( c ) the minimum of the red solid line in ( b ) is plotted as a function of the exchange coupling @xmath216 . for @xmath249",
    ", we obtain @xmath250 . but",
    "nearby values of @xmath216 are induced by molecular vibrations , hence averaging trace ( c ) leads to the realistic uncertainty 2.2 times away from @xmath174.,width=8 ]      finally , we elaborate on a subtle point regarding practical implementation . in section",
    "v , evaluating the optimum sensitivity of the reaction yield in case of the maximally anisotropic coupling , we found @xmath171 to be 6.4 times away from the absolute quantum limit @xmath114 .",
    "this optimum , however , is realized for a specific value of @xmath5 , e.g. @xmath251 for the anisotropic case , and a hyperfine coupling @xmath162 .",
    "in other words , if one wants to realize the limit @xmath171 at e.g. earth s field , one needs to find a radical - pair having a lifetime @xmath252 .",
    "we can now explain this earlier finding : because at that lifetime the reaction is almost complete during one ( positive or negative ) swing of the sensitivity function @xmath204 , and further swings do not suppress sensitivity .",
    "now , it is evident by looking at fig.[result]b that the optimum sensitivity @xmath171 we obtain just by using the optimal rp lifetime ( i.e. without any reaction control ) is the same as the one achieved by the authors of @xcite using the reaction control , but taking @xmath253 , which is far from the magnetic field value at which @xmath171 is optimized .",
    "this leads to the following statement summarizing our findings .",
    "one can realize the optimum uncertainty @xmath0 at a desired magnetic field @xmath5 if it is possible to engineer a radical - pair with the specified lifetime and an anisotropic hyperfine coupling approaching the maximal anisotropy .",
    "for example , the lifetime engineering could result from molecular bridges @xcite interleaving the donor and acceptor . on the other hand , if such experimental control of the radical - pair s lifetime is not possible , then the reaction control scheme of @xcite and its modification presented here offer a generally useful alternative .",
    "in this work we introduced the tools of quantum metrology to put formal and fundamental limits to the magnetic sensitivity of radical - pair reactions , a class of spin - dependent biochemical reactions central in the field of spin chemistry and relevant to the avian compass mechanism . knowing what is the fundamental limit is crucial for understanding how successful a particular measurement scheme is , and for motivating the search for new measurement schemes if there is room for improvement . this has been shown to be the case with the reaction yield measurement , which we have shown to be sub - optimal by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "we then took advantage of a recently proposed reaction control scheme , modified the scheme by inclusion of the exchange interaction along the lines of a quantum circuit and ramsey interferometry , and demonstrated a close approach to the absolute quantum limit .",
    "regarding future work , we point to two venues of research naturally following from here .",
    "a recurring discussion @xcite in the quantum dynamics of radical - pair reactions , in particular in relevance to the avian compass , is whether electron spin entanglement is a resource .",
    "in other words , whether the initial singlet electron state , which is maximally entangled , and its subsequent evolution , more or less maintaining the initial entanglement , enhances whatever biological performance radical - pair reactions have . regarding the radical - pair magnetometer we have considered in this work , the answer is clear : considering a radical - pair with a spin - independent lifetime ( @xmath118 ) , and neglecting the intrinsic singlet - triplet decoherence mechanism we introduced @xcite , electron spin entanglement obviously helps _ in principle_. indeed , based on the discussion of sec .",
    "iii.a and sec .",
    "iii.b , for a system consisting of just two _ uncorrelated _ electron spins the optimum magnetic sensitivity is @xmath254 .",
    "allowing quantum correlations one can in principle obtain a @xmath77 improvement , i.e. @xmath255 .",
    "our reaction control scheme of fig.[scheme ] leads to @xmath256 , but this does not imply that entanglement `` does not help '' . in other words , it is not straightforward to arrive at a definitive statement with such comparisons . on the one hand",
    "it is inconceivable how to experiment with two free electron spins in a chemical environment .",
    "radical - pairs offer such a possibility .",
    "similarly , there is no immediate way to controllably `` switch - off '' entanglement within the radical - pair reactions . put differently ,",
    "even though the achieved sensitivity @xmath256 happens to be worse than the two - uncorrelated - spins case , further analysis is required to demonstrate whether or not ( or what part of ) @xmath256 is attributed to entanglement .    moreover , according to our understanding @xcite , singlet - triplet decoherence is an unavoidable feature of the radical - pair mechanism itself , and in the case of equal recombination rates ( @xmath86 ) leads to a master equation for @xmath257 that reads @xmath258-k({{\\rm q}_{\\rm s}}\\rho+\\rho{{\\rm q}_{\\rm s}}-2{{\\rm q}_{\\rm s}}\\rho{{\\rm q}_{\\rm s}})-k\\rho$ ] . in other words , in this work we omitted the second term of the previous equation , firstly because its validity is not generally accepted and we wish to decouple this work from the relevant debate , secondly because omitting it considerably simplifies the calculations , and thirdly we obtain the sought after fundamental limits in the idealized and intuitive physical context of unitary evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the role of decoherence in the magnetic sensitivity @xmath0 ought to be addressed in detail , as it is known that the advantage due to entangled states might deteriorate @xcite .",
    "hence it remains an unsettled issue if entanglement is a resource for this kind of biochemical magnetometers .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to study the fundamental limit @xmath259 in estimating the angle of the magnetic field with respect to a molecular frame of reference .",
    "this is directly relevant to the avian compass function of radical - pair reactions , and the relevant study will be undertaken elsewhere .      for the spheroidal hyperfine interaction @xmath260 considered in sec .",
    "iv.a , the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are @xmath261 ( doubly degenerate ) , @xmath262 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 . taking care of the degeneracy in the calculation of @xmath41 ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are found to be 0 ( doubly degenerate ) , @xmath265 , @xmath266^{1/2}/2(a^2+b^2)$ ] , and @xmath267^{1/2}/2(a^2+b^2)$ ] . by inspection",
    "it is seen that @xmath268 , but due to the cosine term it is not immediately obvious how @xmath269 compares to @xmath270 .",
    "we can prove that for all times @xmath271 .",
    "indeed , take @xmath272 and @xmath273 and subtract from both the common term @xmath59 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath274^{1/2}/2(a^2+b^2)$ ] is less than @xmath59 , or their ratio smaller than 1 .",
    "the maximum value of the term involving the cosine occurs at @xmath275 , where @xmath276 .",
    "then the maximum value of the ratio is @xmath277 for all @xmath42 .",
    "thus the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath41 are @xmath62 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "for the ellipsoidal hyperfine coupling discussed in sec .",
    "iv.b , the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are found to be @xmath278 , @xmath279^{1/2}/[(a_x+a_y)^2 + 4b^2]$ ] , @xmath280^{1/2}/[(a_x+a_y)^2 + 4b^2]$ ] , and @xmath281^{1/2}/[(a_x - a_y)^2 + 4b^2]$ ] .",
    "now it is less straightforward to find the maximum ( and similarly the minimum ) eigenvalue , as for some times @xmath272 is the maximum , while at other times it is @xmath273 .",
    "however , we can prove as in appendix a that _ at any time _ the maximum eigenvalue is smaller or equal than @xmath62 , and similarly the minimum eigenvalue is larger or equal than @xmath105 .",

    "<S> radical - ion pairs and their reactions have triggered the study of quantum effects in biological systems . </S>",
    "<S> this is because they exhibit a number of effects best understood within quantum information science , and at the same time are central in understanding the avian magnetic compass and the spin transport dynamics in photosynthetic reaction centers . </S>",
    "<S> here we address radical - pair reactions from the perspective of quantum metrology . </S>",
    "<S> since the coherent spin motion of radical - pairs is effected by an external magnetic field , these spin - dependent reactions essentially realize a biochemical magnetometer . using the quantum fisher information , we find the fundamental quantum limits to the magnetic sensitivity of radical - pair magnetometers . we then explore how well the usual measurement scheme considered in radical - pair reactions , the measurement of reaction yields , approaches the fundamental limits . in doing so , we find the optimal hyperfine interaction hamiltonian that leads to the best magnetic sensitivity as obtained from reaction yields . </S>",
    "<S> this is still an order of magnitude smaller than the absolute quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that with a realistic quantum reaction control reminding of ramsey interferometry , here presented as a quantum circuit involving the spin - exchange interaction and a recently proposed molecular switch , we can approach the fundamental quantum limit within a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this work opens the application of well - advanced quantum metrology methods to biological systems . </S>"
