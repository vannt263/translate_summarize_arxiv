    "at the end of hydrostatic burning , a massive star consists of concentric shells that are the relics of its previous burning phases ( hydrogen , helium , carbon , neon , oxygen , silicon ) .",
    "iron is the final stage of nuclear fusion in hydrostatic burning , as the synthesis of any heavier element from lighter elements does not release energy ; rather , energy must be used up .",
    "when the iron core , formed in the center of the massive star , grows by silicon shell burning to a mass around the chandrasekhar mass limit of about 1.44 solar masses , electron degeneracy pressure can not longer stabilize the core and it collapses .",
    "this starts what is called a core - collapse supernova in course of which the star explodes and parts of the star s heavy - element core and of its outer shells are ejected into the interstellar medium .    the onset of the collapse and the infall dynamics are very sensitive to the entropy and to the number of leptons per baryon , @xmath1 @xcite . in turn , these two quantities are mainly determined by weak interaction processes , electron capture and @xmath2 decay .",
    "first , in the early stage of the collapse , @xmath1 decreases by electron capture on ( fe - peak ) nuclei , reactions which are energetically favorable when the electrons have fermi energies of a few mev at the densities involved .",
    "this reduces the increase of the electron pressure with density , thus accelerating the collapse , and shifts the distribution of nuclei present in the core to more neutron - rich material ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , upper left panel ) .",
    "second , many of the nuclei present can also @xmath2 decay . while this process is quite unimportant compared to electron",
    "capture for initial @xmath1 values around 0.5 , it becomes increasingly competative for neutron - rich nuclei due to an increase in phase space related to larger @xmath3 values .",
    "electron capture , @xmath2 decay , and partial photodisintegration of iron - group nuclei to alpha particles cost the core energy and reduce its electron density . as a consequence , the collapse is accelerated .",
    "an important change in the physics of the collapse occurs , as the density reaches @xmath4g/@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , upper right panel ) .",
    "then neutrinos are essentially trapped in the core , because their diffusion time ( due to coherent conservative scattering on nuclei ) becomes larger than the collapse time @xcite .",
    "after neutrino trapping , the collapse proceeds essentially homologously @xcite , until nuclear densities ( @xmath6 g/@xmath5 ) are reached . since nuclear matter has a much lower compressibility , the homologous core decelerates and bounces in response to the increased nuclear matter pressure .",
    "this drives a shock wave into the outer core , i.e. the region of the iron core which lies outside of the homologous core and in the meantime has continued to fall inwards at supersonic speed .",
    "the core bounce with the formation of a shock wave is the starting point of a sequence of events that ultimately triggers a supernova explosion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , middle left panel ) , but the exact mechanism of the explosion and the crucial ingredients of this physically appealing scenario are still uncertain and controversial . if the shock wave is strong enough not only to stop the collapse , but also to explode the outer burning shells of the star , one speaks about the ` prompt mechanism ' .",
    "however , it appears as if the energy available to the shock is not sufficient , and the shock uses up its energy in the outer core mostly by the dissociation of heavy nuclei into nucleons .",
    "this change in composition results in even more energy loss , because the electron capture rate on free protons is significantly larger than on neutron - rich nuclei due to the higher @xmath7-values of the latter .",
    "a large fraction of the neutrinos produced by these electron captures behind the shock leave the star quickly in what is called the neutrino burst at shock break - out , carrying away energy .",
    "this leads to further neutronization of the matter .",
    "the shock is weakened so much that it finally stalls and turns into an accretion shock at a radius between 100 and 200@xmath8 km , i.e. , the matter downstream of the shock has negative velocities and continues falling inward ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , middle right panel ) .",
    "all state - of - the - art simulations of stellar core collapse performed in newtonian gravity @xcite , with an approximative treatment of general relativity @xcite , in full general relativity @xcite , and with stiff or soft nuclear equations of state currently available for core - collapse simulations @xcite ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : eos ] ) agree with the models of the 1980 s and 1990 s ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the prompt shock is unable to trigger supernova explosions .",
    "after the core bounce , a compact remnant begins to form at the center of the collapsing star , rapidly growing by the accretion of infalling stellar material until the explosion sets in .",
    "this nascent remnant  the proto - neutron star  will evolve to a neutron star or may eventually collapse to a black hole , depending on whether the progenitor star had a mass below or above roughly 25 solar masses .",
    "the newly born neutron star is initially still proton - rich and contains a large number of degenerate electrons and neutrinos .",
    "the latter are trapped because their mean free paths in the dense matter are significantly shorter than the radius of the neutron star .",
    "it takes a fraction of a second for the trapped neutrinos to diffuse out @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , lower panels ) . on their way to the neutrinosphere ,",
    "the neutrinos are down - scattered in energy space , thus converting their initially high degeneracy energy to thermal energy of the stellar medium @xcite .",
    "the further cooling of the hot interior of the proto - neutron star then proceeds by neutrino - pair production and diffusive loss of neutrinos of all three lepton flavors .",
    "after several tens of seconds the compact remnant becomes transparent to neutrinos and the neutrino luminosity drops significantly @xcite .    in the explosion scenario by the `",
    "delayed neutrino - heating mechanism ' , the stalled shock wave can be revived by the neutrinos streaming off the neutrinosphere .",
    "these neutrinos carry most of the energy set free in the gravitational collapse of the stellar core @xcite and deposit some of their energy in the layers between the nascent neutron star and the stalled shock front mainly by charged - current @xmath9 and @xmath10 captures on free nucleons @xcite , @xmath11 ( fig .  [ fig : snphases ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "this neutrino heating increases the pressure behind the shock and the heated layers begin to expand , creating between shock front and neutron star surface a region of low density but rather high temperature , the so - called ` hot bubble ' @xcite .",
    "the persistent energy input by neutrinos keeps the pressure high in this region and drives the shock outwards again , eventually leading to a supernova explosion .",
    "this may take a few 100 ms and requires that during this time interval a few percent of the radiated neutrino energy ( or 1020% of the energy of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos ) are converted to thermal energy of nucleons , leptons , and photons .",
    "the canonical explosion energy of a supernova is less than one percent of the total gravitational binding energy lost by the nascent neutron star in neutrinos .",
    "the success of the delayed supernova mechanism turned out to be sensitive to a delicate competition of neutrino cooling between the neutrinosphere and the so - called ` gain radius ' on the one hand , and neutrino heating between the gain radius und the shock on the other ( fig .  [ fig : snphases ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "the gain radius is defined as the radial position where the neutrino heating rate per nucleon , @xmath12 and the neutrino cooling rate per nucleon , @xmath13 become equal . in the latter expression",
    "we have used the assumptions that the sum of neutron and proton abundances is unity , @xmath14 , and that the electron and positron degeneracy parameters , @xmath15 , are small : @xmath16 .",
    "the latter approximation is good in the shock - heated layers because the electron number fraction @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the electron and baryon number density , respectively ) and thus the electron degeneracy is rather low and @xmath20 pairs are abundant . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nuheating ] ) , @xmath21 is the radius in @xmath22 cm . the neutrino luminosity @xmath23 ( normalized to @xmath24erg@xmath8s@xmath25 in eq .  [",
    "eq : nuheating ] ) , the average squared neutrino energy @xmath26 ( in units of 15@xmath8mev in eq .",
    "[ eq : nuheating ] ) , and the mean value of the cosine of the angle between the direction of the neutrino propagation and the radial direction , @xmath27 , are calculated from the neutrino phase space occupation function @xmath28 by @xmath29 the quantity @xmath30 is also called flux factor and can be understood as the ratio of the neutrino energy flux , @xmath31 , to the neutrino energy density times @xmath32 . typically , it is close to 0.25 near the neutrinosphere of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and approaches unity when the neutrino distributions get more and more forward peaked in the limit of free streaming with increasing distance from the neutrinosphere .",
    "angle - dependent transport , i.e. , solving the boltzmann transport equation , is necessary to accurately determine the spectral and angular distribution of the neutrinos .",
    "only if the heating is sufficiently strong , depending on the size of the neutrino luminosities and the hardness of the neutrino spectra , an explosion can be triggered @xcite .",
    "the effect is self - enhancing : strong heating of the matter accreted by the shock decelerates the infall and increases the time for matter to absorb neutrino energy , thus raising the efficiency of energy deposition by neutrinos .",
    "this positive feedback leads to further shock expansion and can initiate the final runaway .",
    "strong cooling has the opposite effect .",
    "it accelerates the accretion flow through the gain layer and largely reduces the time matter is exposed to heating , hence diminishing the chance for an explosion @xcite .",
    "the livermore group found the mechanism working successfully only when the neutrino luminosities from the neutron star were assumed to be boosted by neutron - finger convection below the neutrinosphere ( treated by a mixing length theory in the spherically symmetric models ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of neutron - finger instabilities , however , was questioned by independent analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition to this conflicting situation in a crucial aspect of the successful delayed explosion models , there were long - standing concerns that other approximations or numerical deficiencies of the livermore models , e.g.  in the hydrodynamics scheme or resolution , the flux - limited diffusion description of the neutrino transport , and the treatment of neutrino - matter interactions , might have prevented explosions of the models without the controversial neutron - finger convection . for this reason , improved numerical algorithms for one - dimensional simulations were developed .",
    "these are either based on implicit , adaptive - grid solvers for the hydrodynamics and boltzmann transport equations @xcite or use conservative , third - order schemes with a riemann - solver for the explicit integration of the hydrodynamics equations , coupled to an implicit solver for the moment equations of neutrino number , energy , and momentum with a closure relation ( variable eddington - factor ) computed from a model boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is basically newtonian but employs an effective potential to account for the effects of general relativistic gravity , and includes corrections for gravitational redshift and time dilation in the neutrino transport .",
    "core - collapse calculations with both codes were compared and show very good agreement @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has also been spent on implementing weak interaction processes or improvements of the description of such reactions that have been recognized to be of importance in addition to the standard set of processes and their canonical treatment as given by bruenn @xcite . among these extensions and improvements are shell - model based calculations for @xmath2-processes of neutrinos and nuclei ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : nuclbeta ] ) and for inelastic neutral - current neutrino - nuclei scatterings ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : nuclinel ] ) , and the inclusion of ion - ion correlations in coherent neutrino - nuclei scatterings @xcite .",
    "neutrino interactions with free nucleons have been corrected for nucleon thermal motions and recoil @xcite and the weak magnetism @xcite , and have been generalized for including nucleon correlation effects in high - density media @xcite .",
    "of particular importance for the transport of muon and tau neutrinos are nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , @xmath33 @xcite , and neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to pairs of other flavors , @xmath34 @xcite , which dominate @xmath35-annihilation in the production of @xmath36 and @xmath37 pairs @xcite , and to a minor degree also scattering reactions between neutrinos and antineutrinos of different flavors such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "including all these additional reactions and improvements makes the radiated heavy - lepton neutrino spectra much more similar to the spectra of @xmath9 and @xmath10 than previously thought @xcite .",
    "the similarity of these spectra and the corresponding mean energies at later postbounce times can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuspectra ] .",
    "spherically symmetric simulations with the new and more accurate hydrodynamics and neutrino transport codes with or without the extended set of neutrino reactions @xcite , disregarding neutron - finger instabilities and other multi - dimensional effects , agree with the livermore calculations that no delayed explosions can be obtained for progenitors more massive than 10@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , in case of stars with birth masses of 810@xmath0 , which develop instead of an iron core a core of onemg with a thin carbon shell , surrounded by an extremely dilute and only loosely bound he - shell , neutrino heating was found to power explosions in one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulations even without convective luminosity enhancement @xcite .",
    "also this result of the livermore group was confirmed qualitatively by more recent models ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : onemgexplosion ] ) , but the more sophisticated neutrino transport in the new simulations produces less energetic explosions of only 1@xmath40erg ( = @xmath80.10.2@xmath8bethe ) , in agreement with the estimated kinetic energy of the filaments of the crab nebula @xcite . the latter has been suggested as the remnant of the explosion of a star with onemg core because of its small carbon and oxygen abundances and its helium overabundance @xcite .",
    "moreover , the early supernova ejecta develop a proton - excess instead of the former neutron - richness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : onemgexplosion ] , right panel ) .",
    "this removes the problem of a vast overproduction of some rare , very neutron - rich isotopes in this material ( for more discussion of the nucleosynthesis in proton - rich ejecta , see sect .",
    "[ sec : nucl ] ) .",
    "hans bethe in his supernova review of 1990 @xcite already pointed out that the hot - bubble region should be convectively unstable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "a negative entropy gradient behind the accretion shock is generated because neutrino heating is much stronger near the gain radius than at larger distances from the neutrinosphere .",
    "multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations indeed showed that violent convective overturn develops in this layer and enhances the neutrino - energy deposition there @xcite .",
    "neutrino - driven explosions were thus obtained even when spherically symmetric simulations failed @xcite .",
    "a second convectively unstable region was found to exist inside the newly formed neutron star @xcite , also indicated in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : snphases ] .",
    "it is , however , probably less important for the explosion mechanism because the enhancement of the neutrino emission is rather modest @xcite .",
    "the success of the first 2d models with postshock convection could not be reproduced by more recent calculations @xcite where energy - dependent neutrino transport replaced the simple grey diffusion schemes employed previously . with the currently most sophisticated treatment of neutrino transport that is applied in multi - dimensional supernova simulations ( at the same level of refinement in the treatment of neutrino - matter interactions as in the state - of - the - art 1d models ) ,",
    "neutrino heating and postshock convection were found to trigger a ( probably rather weak ) explosion only in case of an 11.2@xmath0 star ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:112explosion ] ) .",
    "the more massive progenitors investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite had much higher densities and larger binding energies in the shells surrounding the iron core . the ram pressure associated with the high mass accretion rate of these infalling dense shells damped the shock expansion .",
    "therefore no explosions were obtained for such stars during the simulated evolution periods of about 300@xmath8ms after core bounce , although a crucial criterion , the ratio of advection timescale to heating timescale , indicates that the critical condition for an explosion was not missed by much ( roughly a factor of two in the 2d , 90-degree simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the onset of the explosion of the 11.2@xmath0 star was aided by a recently discovered generic instability of the accretion shock to non - radial deformation .",
    "this so - called sasi ( standing accretion shock instability ; @xcite ) shows highest growth rates of the @xmath41 modes ( i.e. , the dipole and quadrupole terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics ) and causes a bipolar sloshing of the shock with pulsational strong expansion and contraction .",
    "since the shock is pushed farther out and the time matter stays in the heating layer therefore increases , this strengthens the neutrino - energy deposition and ultimately leads to a globally asymmetric initiation of the explosion .",
    "the rapid growth of this instability can be seeded by the perturbations resulting from the onset of convection in the postshock layer , but occurs also in situations which are convectively stable .",
    "it can be understood by an amplifying ` advective - acoustic cycle ' in which vorticity perturbations created at the shock are carried inward by the accretion flow , create sound waves when the gas falls onto the neutron star , and the sound waves propagating back to the shock cause larger vorticity perturbations there , closing the feedback loop @xcite .",
    "the sasi was found to be present in all two - dimensional ( 2d ) core - collapse simulations when the calculations were performed with a 180-degree grid and the onset of the explosion was delayed for a sufficiently long time ( longer than in the 2d simulations with grey diffusion ) , thus allowing the instability to develop @xcite .",
    "the presence of the sasi by itself , however , does not cause the supernova explosion .",
    "different from simulations without neutrinos , where an accumulation of turbulent energy in the postshock layer was found and led to shock expansion @xcite , this energy accumulation seems to be absent in the neutrino cooled and heated environment of the supernova core .",
    "the role of the low - mode sasi in the successful 11.2@xmath0 model ( and also in other simulations ) is more indirect .",
    "being stronger than convection , it supports shock expansion and thus significantly improves the conditions for efficient neutrino heating .",
    "the potential importance of this instability for understanding observable properties of supernovae and their remnants was demonstrated recently by a large set of two- and three - dimensional simulations in which neutrino - driven explosions were artificially initiated by chosing a sufficiently high value of the neutrino luminosity of the forming neutron star @xcite .",
    "these simulations showed that the explosion asymmetry grows stochastically from initial random seed perturbations , breaking the initial sphericity of the collapsing star on a global scale .",
    "the highly anisotropic explosions due to a dominant @xmath42-mode sasi - instability can lead to a large recoil of the newly born neutron star in the direction opposite to the stronger mass ejection .",
    "while about half of the computed models produced small neutron star kicks with velocities of only around 100@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath25 or less , the mean value of the recoil velocity was found to be several hundred kilometers per second and even cases with more than 1000@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath25 were obtained , in agreement with the measured proper motions of young pulsars .",
    "three - dimensional simulations have revealed the possibility of an unstable @xmath43 spiral sasi mode that can create a strong rotational flow in the vicinity of the accreting neutron star , thus providing a new mechanism for the generation of neutron star spin @xcite .",
    "moreover , the globally asymmetric onset of the explosion with sizable initial shock deformation ( axis ratios of more than 2:1 were obtained ) triggers strong hydrodynamic instabilities at the composition interfaces of the progenitor when the shock propagates outward to the stellar surface .",
    "this leads to large - scale element mixing in the exploding star .",
    "iron - group nuclei , silicon , and oxygen , as well as radioactive isotopes are carried from their production sites near the nascent neutron star into the hydrogen envelope , while hydrogen and helium are mixed deep into the expanding ejecta .",
    "supernova simulations in which the sasi - deformed explosion was continuously followed from its initiation by the neutrino - heating mechanism until several hours later for the first time achieved to explain the anisotropies , element mixing , and high nickel velocities observed in supernova 1987a without invoking artificial and ad hoc assumptions @xcite .",
    "a unified picture therefore seems to emerge in which hydrodynamic instabilities in the supernova core during the first seconds of the explosion help starting the explosion , create the seed for the ejecta asymmetries observed later on , and are essential for explaining the measured kick velocities and rotation rates of pulsars .",
    "but , of course , these conclusions are based on simulations in which neutrino - driven explosions were obtained by a suitable choice of the neutrino luminosities rather than fully self - consistent modeling .",
    "what is the missing ingredient why such self - consistent models for progenitor masses larger than about 12@xmath0 have not produced explosions ?",
    "the situation is currently not clear .",
    "three - dimensional simulations with sophisticated energy - dependent neutrino transport have not been performed yet but are definitely indispensable to judge about the viability of the neutrino - heating mechanism in the more massive progenitor stars , in particular because the critical timescale ratio suggests that the 2d models do not fail by much . in three dimensions",
    "the flow dynamics might reveal important differences compared to axisymmetric models , in particular with respect to the growth of convective and rayleigh - taylor instabilities , the possibility of non - radial , non - axisymmetric instability modes , or the development of local fluid vortices .",
    "three - dimensional simulations with energy - dependent neutrino transport , however , have such high cpu - time demands that supercomputers ten to hundred times more powerful than currently available will be needed , and numerical codes are necessary that are able to efficiently use thousands of processors .",
    "moreover , although current 2d models do not show a large luminosity boost by neutron star convection @xcite , the question whether convective or mixing processes below and around the neutrinosphere could more strongly enhance the neutrinospheric neutrino emission and thus significantly strengthen the neutrino heating behind the shock , must still be considered as unsettled : doubly diffusive instabilities @xcite , neutrino - bubble instabilities @xcite , or magnetic buoyancy instabilities @xcite deserve further investigation by multi - dimensional modelling .    or do explosions require a different mechanism to be at work , for example invoking very rapid rotation of the collapsing stellar core and the amplification of magnetic fields through compression and wrapping , @xmath44-@xmath45 dynamo action , or the magneto - rotational instability in the shear flow at the periphery of a differentially rotating nascent neutron star ( for a review , see @xcite ) ? the fields could then convert the free energy of the differential rotation of the forming compact remnant to kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta either by magnetic forces ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) or viscous heating behind the shock in addition to the energy input there by neutrinos @xcite . such scenarios , however , seem currently disfavored for ordinary supernovae because of the slow rotation of their progenitors predicted by stellar evolution calculations @xcite . instead , magnetohydrodynamic effects are likely to be the mechanism by which accretion energy is converted to the extreme energy output of hypernovae and the jetted outflow in gamma - ray bursts",
    ".    recently burrows _",
    "et al . _ , based on results from their 2d core - collapse simulations , proposed a new acoustic mechanism for launching and powering the explosion @xcite .",
    "due to anisotropic accretion , the neutron star in their models is exited to strong g - mode oscillations .",
    "the large - amplitude core motions then create powerful sonic activity in the neutron star surroundings by which energy is transported to the shock , driving the explosion .",
    "the source of this energy is the gravitational binding energy of the accreted gas , converted to sound by the rapidly ringing neutron star , which thus acts like a transducer .",
    "_  attribute their discovery to the use of a new  according to their arguments superior because linear momentum conserving  treatment of the effects of gravity in their code and the use of a computational grid without the coordinate singularity that is present at the stellar center in the commonly used polar grids .",
    "they speculate that the combination of both aspects allows them to see the excitation of the @xmath46 g - mode oscillations in their 2d simulations , while other groups for numerical reasons can not .",
    "this reasoning , however , is questioned by the fact that the 2d models of the garching group show the presence of this mode and of the higher ( @xmath47 ) modes in the neutron star as well , all of them with similar , but a factor 10100 smaller , amplitudes than in the calculations of burrows _ et al .",
    "_ moreover , experiments with the code setup used for supernova simulations by the garching group reveal that a large - amplitude core g - mode , when artificially instigated , can very well be followed over many periods .",
    "so the question arises , whether a large - amplitude oscillation as seen by burrows _ et al . _",
    "is really excited in the supernova core . and",
    ", in particular , will it also be excited when simulations are performed in three dimensions , i.e. , without the enforced axial symmetry and associated preferred axis - direction of 2d simulations ? moreover , the core g - mode in the calculations by burrows _ et al . _   gains sufficient strength for powering the explosion only at very late postbounce times ( @xmath48s ; @xcite ) .",
    "neutron stars with large masses are the consequence , and the acoustic mechanism will have its chance only if no other mechanism achieves to explode the star faster ( as neutrino heating does , e.g. , in case of the exploding 811@xmath0 models of figs .",
    "[ fig : onemgexplosion ] and [ fig:112explosion ] ) . and",
    "even then , the core oscillation energy that is potentially available for the explosion might be rather low , possibly too low to account for explosion energies in agreement with supernova observations .",
    "significant improvements of all numerical codes currently in use and again 3d simulations will be needed to finally confirm or reject the exitation of strong g - mode @xmath46 oscillations in the neutron star .",
    "also further improvements of the neutrino transport methods will have to be implemented in the long run @xcite , because the best energy - dependent schemes that have been applied in full - scale supernova simulations so far either do not couple the energy bins @xcite or use approximations to the neutrino transport in non - radial directions @xcite .    only recently , collective @xmath49-flavor conversion was discovered to be of potential relevance between neutrinosphere and supernova shock @xcite .",
    "different from matter - enhanced mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) neutrino oscillations , which are suppressed in the dense medium of the supernova core unless the neutrino mass difference is in the ev to kev range  which requires the uncertain existence of a sterile neutrino  , the new flavor transformation process depends only on the presence of a dense neutrino radiation field .",
    "its implications for the supernova explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis , however , are still unclear and subject of ongoing research .    finally , but certainly of crucial importance , all further steps of improving supernova simulations must be accompanied and supported by the improvement of the microphysics that plays a decisive role in the supernova core .",
    "electron captures on nuclei , for example , govern the reduction of @xmath1 during the core collapse phase and thus decide about the shock formation radius and subsequent shock expansion .",
    "similarly , the nuclear equation of state , which is still incompletely known , also influences strongly the shock formation and initial shock strength by its incompressibility at core bounce .",
    "the nuclear eos , moreover , determines the compactness and thus the size and contraction of the nascent neutron star , which in turn influence the shock evolution after bounce . in the following , we will therefore discuss in more detail the nuclear physics input needed for supernova models .",
    "on general grounds the structure of nuclear matter is determined by a competition between the short - ranged surface force and the long - range coulomb force .",
    "the surface energy is reduced with aggregation as this decreases the ratio of surface area to volume . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb energy is reduced by dispersion as this decreases the inter - proton repulsion . as a result ,",
    "for densities smaller than about @xmath50 , nucleonic matter consists of individual nuclei , where @xmath51 g/@xmath5 is the uniform nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "however , at larger densities the equilibrium configuration of nuclear matter is achieved by diverse geometrical forms in a competition of uniform nuclear matter and the vacuum @xcite .    during",
    "most of stellar evolution the nuclear composition is determined by a network of nuclear reactions between the nuclei present in the stellar environment .",
    "electromagnetic reactions of the type @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 , and once free neutrons are produced , also @xmath54 , play a particularly important role to fuse nuclides to successively larger nuclei . as the stellar environment has a finite temperature @xmath55 ,",
    "these reactions are in competition with the inverse dissociation reactions ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ) ) and for temperatures exceeding @xmath59 , where @xmath7 is the threshold energy ( q - value ) for the dissociation process to occur , a capture reaction and its inverse get into equilibrium .",
    "similarly also nuclear reactions mediated by the strong and electromagnetic interaction get into equilibrium with their inverse once the temperature is high enough for the charged particles to effectively penetrate the coulomb barrier . for supernovae",
    "this has the important consequence that for temperatures exceeding a few 100 kevs , all reactions mediated by the electromagnetic and strong interaction are in equilibrium with their inverse and the nuclear composition becomes independent of the rates for these reactions .",
    "it is given by nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) with the constraints that the total mass and charge of the composition is conserved .",
    "the latter condition reflects the fact that charge can only be changed by reactions via the weak interaction which , however , are not in equilibrium as neutrinos can leave the star ( until neutrino trapping is effectively reached ) . due to the two conserved quantities ( mass , charge neutrality ) there exist two independent chemical potentials which are conventionally chosen as @xmath60 and @xmath61 for neutrons and protons , respectively . in nse the chemical potential for a nucleus with charge number @xmath62 and mass number @xmath63 is then given by @xmath64 the nuclei obey boltzmann statistics .",
    "thus the number density @xmath65 of a nucleus ( mass @xmath66 ) is related to its chemical potential via    @xmath67 \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ]    with the nuclear partition function @xmath68 where the sum runs over all nuclear states with excitation energy @xmath69 and total angular momentum @xmath70 . upon inserting ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) into ( [ eq : chempot ] )",
    ", one obtains the saha equation which relates the abundance ( @xmath71 ) of a nucleus to the proton and neutron abundances    @xmath72    with @xmath73 and the constraints @xmath74 ( conservation number nucleons ) and @xmath75 ( charge neutrality ) , where the sum runs over all nuclei present in the composition and @xmath1 is the electron - to - nucleon ratio .",
    "due to charge neutrality , this is identical to the proton - to - nucleon ratio .",
    "the fact that temperatures are high enough in the late stage of stellar evolution to drive matter into nse facilitates simulations significantly as the matter composition becomes independent of the rates for reactions mediated by the electromagnetic and strong interaction . in practice",
    ", stellar evolution is studied in two steps : the star is followed through its various hydrostatic core and shell burning stages considering an appropriate nuclear network and taking advantage of the fact that neutrinos can leave the star unhindered and thus serve only as a source for energy losses .",
    "the simulations stop once the star reaches the _ presupernova _ stage ; i.e. the inner stellar core collapses with velocities in excess of 1000 km / s , which is achieved when the central density and temperatures are of order @xmath76g/@xmath5 and @xmath76k ( 860  kev ) @xcite .",

    "however , it has been found that so - called @xmath152 shell model calculations , which account for all two - nucleon correlations of the valence nucleons within one major oscillator shell , overestimate the measured gt strengths by a constant factor ( which lead to the introduction of the effective axial - vector coupling constant as discussed above ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of the quenching is mainly due to higher - shell admixtures in the ground state wave function which causes a portion of the gt strength to be shifted to moderately high excitation energies .",
    "in fact , by detailed ( p , n ) reaction studies on @xmath153zr gt@xmath88 strength has been identified up to excitation energies of order 90 mev @xcite .    while the gt data from the ( p , n ) and ( n , p ) experiments have been inexpensible for the understanding of gt distributions in nuclei , these probes have relatively poor energy resolution , in particular the ( n , p ) experiments . nowadays",

[ fig : supcore ] ]    we note that the shell model weak interaction rates predict the presupernova evolution to proceed along a temperature - density-@xmath1 trajectory where the weak processes are dominated by nuclei rather close to stability . thus it will be possible , after radioactive ion - beam facilities become operational , to further constrain the shell model calculations by measuring relevant beta decays and gt distributions for unstable nuclei .",
    "@xcite identifies those nuclei which dominate ( defined by the product of abundance times rate ) the electron capture and beta decay during various stages of the final evolution of a 15@xmath171 , 25@xmath171 and 40@xmath171 star .",
    "the continuous electron captures in the core do not only reduce the electron - to - nucleon ratio , and hence the pressure which the electron degeneracy can stem against the gravitational collapse , it also shifts the nuclear composition in the core to more neutron - rich and heavier nuclei ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : nseabund ] . as noted by fuller",
    ", this tendency might significantly reduce the electron captures once nuclei with neutron numbers @xmath173 are abundant @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on the independent particle model ( ipm ) : gt transitions can only proceed to the same nuclear orbital or to the spin - orbit partner in the same harmonic oscillator shell . consequently , for nuclei with charge - numbers @xmath174 , but neutron numbers @xmath173 gt transitions are completely blocked by the pauli principle within the independent particle model @xcite . hence it has been assumed for many years that electron captures during the collapse phase occur on free protons rather than on nuclei , although the abundance of free protons is noticeably smaller than the one of nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ipm picture is not applicable . at first",
    ", the core has a sizable finite temperature which can lead to thermal unblocking of gt transitions @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the energy gap between the pf - shell ( @xmath175 ) and the lowest orbital of the next ( sdg ) shell ( @xmath176 ) is only 23 mev .",
    "the residual interaction thus mixes nucleons in these orbitals leading to neutron holes in the pf - shell or to proton excitations to sdg ( mainly @xmath176 ) orbitals .",
    "both effects unblock gt@xmath89 transitions .",
    "in fact , recent experiments have observed a non - vanishing gt@xmath89 strength for @xmath177ge and @xmath178se @xcite which should be exactly zero in the ipm .",
    "an additional complication arizes for the calculation of the stellar electron capture rates due to the finite temperature of the core . at a typical core temperature of @xmath179 mev ,",
    "the internal excitation energy of a nucleus with mass number @xmath180 is about 8 - 10 mev , i.e. much larger than the energy gap between the pf- and sdg - shells .",
    "hence , one expects that at the stellar temperatures the unquenching of gt@xmath89 transitions is more effective than for the ground state .",
    "unfortunately , diagonalization shell model calculations , which have been successfully applied to the evaluation of electron capture rates for lighter ( i.e. pure pf - shell ) nuclei can not be employed for the required multi - shell calculations due to the extreme dimensions of the model spaces involved ( for @xmath177ge a calculation within the pf - sdg model space contains about @xmath181 configurations ) . to overcome this problem ,",
    "a hybrid model has been suggested @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "the nucleus is described by a slater determinant with temperature - dependent occupation numbers for the valence orbitals .",
    "these occupation numbers are determined within the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach which allows the calculation of thermally - averaged properties of nuclei in extremely large model spaces ( here the full pf - sdg shells ) and considering the relevant correlations among nucleons @xcite .",
    "although the smmc allows in principle the calculation of gt strength distributions , such calculations are numerically quite challenging and usually enable only the determination of the first 2 moments of the distribution which is insufficient for the calculation of stellar electron capture rates @xcite .",
    "therefore , the capture rates are derived in a second step from the gt@xmath89 strength distributions calculated within the random phase approximation built on top of the temperature - dependent slater determinant . using the hybrid model , capture rates",
    "have been determined for about 200 nuclei and , combined with the rates for pf - shell nuclei @xcite , a rate table for the appropriate collapse temperatures , densities and @xmath1 values has been compiled .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) treats nucleon - nucleon correlations only on the 1-particle-1-hole level and hence misses higher - order correlations , which are considered within the shell model and which are important to reproduce details of the gt strength like fragmentation and the low - energy tail of the strength ( which is particularly important for the calculation of @xmath2-decay rates ) .",
    "however , the rpa is known to give a reasonable account of the centroid of strength distributions as well as of the total gt@xmath89 strength .",
    "thus , one should be cautious to use the hybrid model for stellar conditions for which the electron chemical potential is similar to the nuclear q - value as then the capture rate will be quite sensitive to the detailed gt@xmath89 strength distribution ( shell model and hybrid model rates can then easily deviate by factors 23 @xcite ) .",
    "luckily , @xmath182 occurs at core densities at which the core composition is still dominated by nuclei @xmath183 for which large - scale shell model rates exist @xcite . at higher densities ,",
    "when nuclei with @xmath184 , for which diagonalization shell model calculations are not possible and the capture rates have to be estimated by the hybrid model , are abundant , the electron chemical potentials is noticeably larger than the typical nuclear @xmath7-values . under these conditions",
    "capture rates are mainly sensitive to the centroid and the total strength of the gt@xmath89 distributions which are reasonably well described within the rpa . at even higher densities ,",

    "it has been customary to simulate the explosion and the effects of the shock wave by igniting a thermal bomb in the star s interior or by initiating the explosion by a strong push with a piston .",

    "in fact , we are currently experiencing decisive advances in nuclear modelling with the development of many - body models , which , based on microscopic nuclear wave functions and realistic ( or reasonable ) nucleon - nucleon interactions , describe the low - energy nuclear spectra and properties .",
    "furthermore , attempts are on the way to combine the progress in nuclear structure with the dynamics of reaction models .",
    "certainly these models benefit from ever growing computational power , but they will decisively improve once the next generation of radioactive ion - beam facilities like ribf at riken and the facility for antiproton and ion research fair at gsi are operational . these facilities will allow the experimental determination of the properties of many of the unstable nuclei that are essential in many explosive astrophysical scenarios , including core - collapse supernovae",
    ". in particular , these facilities will advance our understanding of the isospin degree of freedom in nuclei and , more specifically for one of our major themes in this review , experiments with radioactive ion - beams will improve and constrain the nuclear models required to calculate the weak - interaction rates on nuclei during the core collapse by determining the single - particle structure and ground - state gamow - teller distributions for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "while radioactive ion - beam facilities will only indirectly contribute to the nuclear physics during the collapse , they will provide direct and essential nuclear data for supernova nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "such crucial improvements range from precise mass measurements of heavy nuclei with @xmath251 , which will determine whether the @xmath247 process is indeed capable of producing the light p - nuclides @xcite , to mass and halflive measurements for many r - process nuclei , hopefully removing the largest uncertainties in simulations of r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "certainly we see the break of dawn of a new and exciting era in nuclear astrophysics in general and in supernova modelling in particular",

    "<S> advances in our understanding and the modeling of stellar core - collapse and supernova explosions over the past 15 years are reviewed , concentrating on the evolution of hydrodynamical simulations , the description of weak interactions and nuclear equation of state effects , and new insights into the nucleosynthesis occurring in the early phases of the explosion , in particular the neutrino - p process . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is enabled by the proton - richness of the early ejecta , which was discovered because of significant progress has been made in the treatment of neutrino transport and weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this progress has led to a new generation of sophisticated newtonian and relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> based on these , it is now clear that the prompt bounce - shock mechanism is not the driver of supernova explosions , and that the delayed neutrino - heating mechanism can produce explosions without the aid of multi - dimensional processes only if the progenitor star has an onemg core inside a very dilute he - core , i.e. , has a mass in the 810@xmath0 range . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamic instabilities of various kinds have indeed been recognized to occur in the supernova core and to be of potential importance for the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino - driven explosions , however , have been seen in two - dimensional simulations with sophisticated neutrino transport so far only when the star has a small iron core and low density in the surrounding shells as being found in stars near 1011@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the explosion mechanism of more massive progenitors is still a puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> it might involve effects of three - dimensional hydrodynamics or might point to the relevance of rapid rotation and magnetohydrodynamics , or to still incompletely explored properties of neutrinos and the high - density equation of state .    </S>",
    "<S> hardly any other astrophysical event is as complex and physically diverse as the death of massive stars in a gravitational collapse and subsequent supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> all four known forces of nature are involved and play an important role in extreme regimes of conditions . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic plasma dynamics in a strong gravitational field sets the stage , weak interactions govern the energy and lepton number loss of the system via the transport of neutrinos from regions of very high opacities to the free - streaming regime , electromagnetic and strong interactions determine the thermodynamic properties , and nuclear and weak interactions change the composition of the stellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> supernova explosions thus offer a fascinating playground of physics on most different scales of length and time and also provide a testbed for new or exotic phenomena . naturally , these spectacular astrophysical events have attracted  and have deserved  the interest and attention of researchers with very different backgrounds . to the advantage of the field , </S>",
    "<S> also hans bethe has preserved for many years his interest in the large diversity of physics problems posed by supernovae .    in this article we will discuss some of the progress that has been made in the simulations of stellar core collapse and supernova explosions on the one hand , and in the description of the microphysics input of such models on the other , since hans bethe published his grand review article in 1990 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field is very broad and has experienced also a great expansion after long - soft gamma - ray bursts have been discovered to be linked to extraordinarily energetic explosions of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> a single article can therefore hardly cover all interesting developments satisfactorily . for recent reviews of the theory and observations of stellar collapse events , focussing on different aspects , </S>",
    "<S> see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will concentrate here on some selected topics , chosen according to our preference but also by their links to contributions from hans bethe and his coworkers . after giving a summary of the physical processes and evolutionary stages that lead from stellar core collapse to supernova explosion </S>",
    "<S> , we will briefly review the current status of modeling supernovae and of our present understanding of the explosion mechanism , in particular we will also highlight the open ends of the current research . </S>",
    "<S> in the subsequent parts of our article we will then concentrate on nuclear and weak interaction physics that plays an important role for developing better numerical models , and we will report new insights brought by such model improvements about the nucleosynthesis during supernova explosions . </S>"
