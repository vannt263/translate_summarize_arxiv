    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are appealing models in which the three gauge groups are unified at a high energy scale .",
    "the precise measurements of the lep experiments seem to suggest that the three gauge couplings are unified at about @xmath5 gev with particle contents of the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however , one of the most serious problems to construct a model of guts is how to realize the mass splitting between the triplet and the doublet higgs particles in the higgs sector .",
    "this problem is so - called triplet - doublet ( td ) splitting problem .",
    "recently , a new idea for solving the td splitting problem has been suggested in 5 dimensional ( 5d ) @xmath6 gut where the 5th dimensional coordinate is compactified on an @xmath7 orbifold @xcite-@xcite , where only higgs and gauge fields can propagate in 5 dimensions .",
    "the orbifolding makes the @xmath6 gauge group reduce to the sm gauge group and realizes the td splitting since the doublet ( triplet ) higgs fields have ( not ) kaluza - klein zero - modes .",
    "following this new idea , a lot of works are made progress in the directions of larger unified gauge symmetry and higher space - time dimensions@xcite-@xcite . in these models ,",
    "gauge symmetry and supersymmetry are broken through orbifold projections and/or the scherk - schwarz mechanism@xcite .",
    "especially , the reduction of @xmath0 gauge symmetry and the td splitting solution are discussed in 6d theory in refs.@xcite@xcite .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields propagate in 6 dimensions , and the suitable orbifolding and boundary conditions on the fixed points can induce the gauge symmetry reduction , @xmath8 , and realize the td splitting by the similar mechanism as the 5d @xmath6 gut on @xmath7 .",
    "as for the trial of inducing the fermion mass hierarchies , two scenarios have been proposed so far .",
    "the first scenario has been discussed in the model of a 6d @xmath9 susy @xmath6 gut@xcite , where all matter multiplets including higgs multiplets are assumed to reside on 4d or 5d space - time , not on 6d space - time . in this scenario ,",
    "the origin of fermion mass hierarchies exists in the volume suppression of wave functions of matter fields .",
    "however , it is difficult to extend the gauge symmetry to @xmath0 and put matter fields in 6 dimensions as commented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second scenario of inducing the fermion mass hierarchies has been considered in flipped @xmath10 gut@xcite in 5 dimensions in ref.@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the suitable fermion mass hierarchies are realized , since only fields which correspond to the * 10 * representation matter fields of georgi - glashow @xmath6 gut@xcite have kaluza - klein zero - modes .",
    "however , the small parameter which produces the fermion mass hierarchies has nothing to do with the extra dimension , since it is a free parameter representing the mixing angle between the ordinal chiral generations and extra vector - like fields .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to suggest more natural mechanism of producing fermion mass hierarchies by combining above two scenarios .",
    "we consider an @xmath11 susy ( ( 1,0)-susy ) @xmath0 gut in 6 dimensions where the 5th and 6th dimensional coordinates are compactified on a @xmath1 orbifold@xcite .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields live in 6 dimensions while ordinal chiral matter fields are localized in 4 dimensions .",
    "@xmath11 susy ( ( 1,0)-susy ) in 6 dimensions requires the gauginos to have opposite chirality from the matter fermions which must all share the same chirality @xcite@xcite .",
    "this feature strongly constrains our model when discussing 6d gauge anomaly .",
    "the orbifolding and boundary conditions make the @xmath0 gauge group be broken to @xmath2 and realize the td splitting .",
    "in addition to the three - generation chiral matter fields , we will introduce extra three sets of vector - like matter fields : two sets of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and four @xmath14 representation fields representation matter fields should have the same 6d chirality as @xmath14 representation higgs fields for the 6d gauge anomaly cancellation@xcite . ]",
    "propagate in 6 dimensions , and chiral fields which couple to @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined as the 1st generation , and one set of @xmath12 and @xmath13 propagates in 5 dimensions and chiral fields which couple to them are defined as the 2nd generation .",
    "we will introduce the @xmath12 and @xmath13 higgs multiplets on the 4d brane which break the @xmath15 gauge symmetry .",
    "we assume the gut scale of @xmath15 breaking , then suitable scale of majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos are obtained .",
    "the mixing angles between the chiral fields and extra generations will be determined by the volume suppression factors .",
    "the suitable fermion mass hierarchies will be generated by integrating out these extra vector - like heavy fields .",
    "moreover , the large ( small ) flavor mixings in the lepton ( quark ) sector will be naturally explained in order .    in section 2 ,",
    "we show the field contents of this model and discuss an orbifold compactification . in section 3",
    ", we will discuss @xmath15 symmetry breaking , majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos , and masses of vector - like matter fields . in section 4 , we will see the mechanism of generating the fermion mass hierarchies .",
    "section 5 gives summary and discussions .",
    "let us show the structure of the extra dimensions at first .",
    "the extra dimensions are compactified on a torus @xmath16 , whose coordinates can be represented by the complex plane , @xmath17 .",
    "the structure of extra 2d spaces are characterized by reflection @xmath18 and translations @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . under the reflection",
    ", @xmath21 is transformed into @xmath22 , which corresponds to the @xmath23 rotation on the complex plane .",
    "the translation symmetry is defined by two vectors @xmath24 . under the translation , @xmath21 is transformed into @xmath25 .",
    "we define ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) = ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , in which @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the two radii of @xmath16 .",
    "when the following identifications for the transformations are imposed on the 6d scalar field @xmath32@xcite as @xmath33 the scalar field @xmath34 is divided into @xmath35 according to the eigenvalues @xmath36 of the @xmath37 parity , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are @xmath40 or @xmath41 by definition .",
    "notice that only @xmath42 in eq.([zero ] ) has a massless zero - mode and survives in the low energy .",
    "other scalar fields in eqs.([1])-([2 ] ) have kaluza - klein masses . the physical space can be taken as @xmath43 and @xmath44 . there are four fixed points at @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the @xmath1 orbifold . we put four 3-branes ( @xmath49- , @xmath50- , @xmath51- , @xmath52-brane ) at these fixed points as in fig .",
    "[ complex plane ] .",
    "next we show the 6d bulk action of gauge multiplet@xcite , which is described in terms of 4d @xmath53 vector @xmath54 and chiral @xmath55 supermultiplet as @xmath56 \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\int d^4\\theta { 1 \\over k g^2 }       { \\rm tr } \\biggl [ ( \\sqrt{2 } \\partial^\\dagger + \\phi^\\dagger )       e^{-v } ( -\\sqrt{2 } \\partial + \\phi ) e^{v } +       \\partial^\\dagger e^{-v } \\partial e^v   \\biggr ] \\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59=k\\delta^{ab}$ ] and @xmath60 .",
    "the orbifold @xmath37 parity shows @xmath61 since @xmath62 and @xmath63 have opposite @xmath37 parity eigenvalues with each other .",
    "when we take the @xmath37 parity operator as @xmath64 and impose the @xmath37 invariance , 6d @xmath11 susy is broken into 4d @xmath11 susy since @xmath63 in eq.([phi ] ) vanishes on the 4d brane ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "as for the translations , we require the following identifications : @xmath65 if @xmath19 acts non - trivially on the @xmath0 gauge symmetry , the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken into its subgroups on the fixed points . in this paper",
    "we adopt the translations as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which commute the generators of the georgi - glashow @xmath69 and the flipped @xmath70 groups , respectively .",
    "as shown in table [ fixed points ] and fig .",
    "[ complex plane ] , the georgi - glashow @xmath69 and the flipped @xmath70 symmetries remain on @xmath50- and @xmath51-brane , respectively . since @xmath71 , there is the pati - salam @xmath72 symmetry@xcite on @xmath52-brane .",
    "note that only an intersection of gauge symmetries on @xmath50- and @xmath51-branes , which is @xmath73 , can survive in 4d branes@xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken down to the @xmath74 gauge symmetries@xcite@xcite . for @xmath75@xcite . however , in order to realize the fermion mass hierarchies by the mechanism which we will propose , we must choose @xmath76 for @xmath38 .",
