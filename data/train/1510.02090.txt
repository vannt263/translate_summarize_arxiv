    "with the number of known exoplanets climbing into the thousands , exoplanet research is at a truly exciting time .",
    "it has already been established that the planet occurrence rate per sun - like star is more than 50% for planets larger than earth and smaller than neptune and with orbital periods of less than about 100 days @xcite , which makes these so called super - earths and mini - neptunes the most abundant planets in our galaxy known to date .",
    "super - earths and mini - neptunes frequently show evidence for large hydrogen and helium envelopes containing several percent of the planet s mass @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the mean densities for exoplanets with measured masses and which have radii , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the earth .",
    "panel a ) shows the mean densities as a function of stellar flux , @xmath2 , received by the planets .",
    "a large spread in mean densities spanning more than one order of magnitude is apparent for fluxes of less than about 200 @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the flux from our sun at 1  au .",
    "the deficit of low mean densities for @xmath4 is well explained by photo - evaporation which can strip significant fractions of the gaseous envelopes of highly irradiated planets @xcite .",
    "and although it has been clearly shown that photo - evaporation can lead to large changes in a planet s mean density and that this may explain the diverse densities in the kepler 11 system @xcite , it likely ca nt account for the large spread in mean densities of planets with low stellar fluxes for which it should not be important .",
    "panel b ) in figure 1 displays the mean densities as a function of planet mass , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the earth .",
    "it illustrates clearly that super - earths and mini - neptunes of a given mass display a large range in mean densities .",
    "this is surprising because formation models would naively predict a single mass - radius relationship @xcite and one would need to appeal to a diversity in formation environments to account for the large scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is especially unsatisfactory for planets in multiple systems which display a large diversity in mean density [ e.g. kepler-20 @xcite , kepler-36 @xcite , kepler-48 @xcite , and kepler-68 @xcite ] .    in this letter",
    "we propose that the large range of observed mean densities may be caused by one or two giant impacts that occurred once the gas disk dissipated .",
    "such giant impacts are expected to be common because they are needed to provide long - term orbital stability of planetary systems and occur typically on timescales between 10 and 100  myrs @xcite .",
    "we calculate the planetary radii as a function of mass for ages of 10 to 100  myrs and use these as input parameters in our one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations in which we calculate the envelope fraction lost due to giant impacts for initial envelope fractions of 1 - 10% .",
    "we demonstrate that a single collision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the envelope - to - core - mass ratio by a factor of two . by following the planets thermal evolution over several gyrs",
    ", we show that this leads to a corresponding increase in mean densities by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in section 2.1",
    ", we construct our own thermal evolution model to calculate the planet radii for a given core mass as a function of time .",
    "we show in section 2.2 that giant impacts can significantly reduce the envelope - to - core - mass ratio and demonstrate in section 2.3 that this results in a large increase in a planet s mean density .",
    "our discussions and conclusions follow in section 3 .",
    "@xcite independently proposed the idea that giant impacts may be responsible for the large diversity in exoplanet densities ; their paper investigates the mass loss for two specific giant impacts using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and their paper was posted on the arxiv as we were preparing this manuscript for submission",
    ".     +   +   +",
    "@xcite has shown by modeling the composition of planets with measured radii and masses that the majority of planets larger than @xmath7 have significant gaseous envelopes .",
    "this implies that these planets likely formed and interacted with the primordial gas disk .",
    "this interaction is expected to have resulted in migration and efficient damping of their eccentricities and inclinations leading to densely packed planetary systems regardless of their exact formation location .",
    "as the gas disk disappears on timescales of 1 - 10  myrs @xcite , secular excitation in densely packed planetary systems will lead to eccentricity growth culminating in one or two giant impacts producing planetary systems with long term stability @xcite .",
    "a large number of multiple planet systems discovered by kepler may therefore have undergone one or two large collisions after the gas disk disappeared .",
    "the radii of planets with significant gaseous envelopes will shrink with time as the planets cool and their envelopes contract .",
    "we evolve the contraction of an envelope of fixed mass @xmath8 about a core with mass @xmath9 over time using the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "we use the term ` core ' here to mean the rocky part of the planet .",
    "typically , for such evolutionary models , the entropy of the envelope when contraction begins is set at an initial , high value ( `` hot start '' ) , and the planet is then allowed to cool @xcite . here",
    "we assume the envelope starts off with an arbitrary high intrinsic luminosity , and we solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium iteratively to determine the radius corresponding to a given @xmath10 pair .",
    "we do the same for a range of luminosities , so that by linking the radius change to a change in internal luminosity and the energy budget of the envelope , we can track the evolution of envelope radius with time .",
    "we choose the initial luminosity to be @xmath11 , although we find the results are generally insensitive to the exact choice of this initial condition for @xmath12 ( @xcite ; see also section 2.3 below ) .    for the super - earths and mini - neptunes with large hydrogen - helium adiabats",
    "the temperature and pressure at the core surface exceed several thousand kelvin and many kilobars , respectively .",
    "these values imply that the rocky core should be partially or fully molten enabling easy heat transfer between the rocky core and the gaseous envelope @xcite .",
    "since for super - earths and mini - neptunes most of the mass is in there core , the core can contribute significantly to the overall energy budget .",
    "for the heat capacity of the core we assume @xmath13 @xcite . we do not include heating from radioactive decay , which we found to have little impact on our results .",
    "we set our initial pressure boundary condition to @xmath14 , suitable for the viewing geometry of optical transits @xcite .",
    "our outer temperature boundary condition is set by assuming a stellar flux of @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are supplemented with those of energy transport .",
    "we assume that when the schwarzschild instability criterion is satisfied , then energy transport is convective , and that when it is not , energy transport is due to radiative diffusion [ see @xcite for further details ] . in the latter case ,",
    "energy transport is governed by the local optical depth .",
    "our opacities are determined from opal opacity tables @xcite .",
    "we assume a metallicity of @xmath16 with hydrogen and helium mass fractions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , yielding a mean molecular mass of 2.3 proton masses .",
    "we ignore mass loss due to photo - evaporation . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show an example of the cooling history of a planet with a @xmath19 core and different envelope mass fractions . envelopes with larger masses contract over longer timescales since they have a larger energy budget and hence longer kelvin - helmholtz timescales .",
    "using one dimensional hydrodynamical simulations , we calculated the envelope - mass - loss resulting from a giant impact .",
    "we only model the adiabatic part of the envelope , since the thin isothermal outer - layer contains negligible mass .",
    "we track the propagation of a shock launched into the envelope due to local ground motion by solving the hydrodynamic equations with a finite - difference , lagrangian scheme .",
    "each mass parcel is tracked , and if it reaches velocities greater than its initial , radius - dependent escape velocity from the planet , it is considered lost .",
    "we determine the global envelope - mass - loss fraction by integrating the local mass loss over the entire surface of the planet where we account for the global distribution of the different ground velocities .",
    "the ground velocities were calculated by relating the impactor mass , @xmath20 and impact velocity , @xmath21 , to the resulting ground motion at the various locations of the planet by approximating the impacts as point like explosions on a sphere .",
    "such explosions result in self - similar solution of the second type @xcite .",
    "assuming momentum conservation @xcite we find that the velocity component of the shocked fluid perpendicular to the planet s surface is given by @xmath22},\\ ] ] @xcite where @xmath23 is the radius of the planet and @xmath24 the distance that the shock has transversed from the impact point .",
    "we compared our envelope - mass - loss results with those reported in @xcite and @xcite who used 3d impact simulations to determine the surface velocity field .",
    "for the parameters corresponding to the various moon - forming scenarios investigated in their work , we find good agreement between their envelope - mass - loss results and ours .",
    "further details of our model can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the impacts are triggered once the gas disk has disappeared , they typically happen when the planetary system is between 10 - 100  myrs old .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig2 ] , the planetary radii at these early times are significantly more extended than at ages of a few gyrs by when they had time to cool and contract ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when estimating the envelope - mass - loss fraction due to a planetary collision we therefore determine the loss fraction for a range of planetary radii .",
    "we note here that a giant impact can significantly modify the radial profile of the envelope .",
    "however , since the envelope profile after thermal evolution over gyr timescales is generally insensitive to the exact conditions during the first few tens of millions of years , the collision is not expected to leave any significant long - term signatures in the planet s envelope .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows the resulting mass loss as a function of impactor momentum from our hydrodynamical simulations for envelope mass fractions of 1% and 5% .",
    "the planetary radii were chosen such that they correspond to systems that are 50  myrs of age ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "an adiabatic index of @xmath25 was used in this simulation because when examining the planet s thermal and density profiles during the accretion and cooling phase , it has been found that @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this low value of @xmath27 is due to the dissociation of hydrogen , which we find is marginally important for super - earths and mini - neptunes .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is interesting because it determines how the mass is distributed inside the gaseous envelope .",
    "since the density , @xmath28 , of an envelope dominated by convection scales as @xmath29 , we find that its mass is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the height in the envelope .",
    "hence , for @xmath26 , the mass in an adiabatic envelope is concentrated towards the core , whereas for values of @xmath32 , which applies for diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom ( @xmath33 ) and monoatomic gas with three degrees of freedom ( @xmath34 ) , the mass is concentrated towards the radiative - convective boundary .",
    "how the mass distribution in the gaseous envelope affects the global mass loss is shown in figure [ fig3]b , which displays the envelope - mass - loss fraction for @xmath33 and @xmath25 .",
    "for identical planet masses and radii more mass is lost for the @xmath25 than the @xmath33 case because in the former the mass of the envelope is concentrated towards the core such that the shock that is launched into the envelope from the core can impart a larger momentum onto the envelope .",
    "figure [ fig3]c displays the mass loss dependence on the envelope radius . for @xmath33 we find that for identical collision parameters less mass is lost for larger envelope radii .",
    "this result arises because for @xmath33 the envelope mass is concentrated towards the edge of the envelope and larger radii result in lower envelope densities at the core , which in turn implies that the shock travels with a smaller momentum into the envelope .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath35 case , the mass loss dependence on envelope radius would be weaker , because most of the envelope mass is concentrated towards the core .",
    "finally , figure [ fig3]d shows how much the envelope - mass - loss could be increased for very close - in planets because of their small hill radii .",
    "when calculating the envelope - mass - loss fraction a fluid parcel is lost when it was accelerated to velocities greater or equal to its original escape velocity . for very close - in planets the mass loss can be increased because it is sufficient for a fluid parcel to reach velocities to reach to the hill radius , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the semi - major axis and @xmath38 the mass of the star . the velocity needed for escape",
    "is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the escape velocity at a given position @xmath31 in the envelope before the impact and @xmath31 is measured from the center of the core .",
    "usually , the hill radius is much larger than the radius of the planet such that @xmath41 , but for extended envelopes and small semi - major axis the planets radius can become comparable to the hill radius .",
    "an example of such a case is shown in figure [ fig3]d , where the planet s radius is chosen such that it is equal to its hill radius .    using the results presented in figure [ fig3 ] we can read off the envelope - mass - loss fraction , @xmath42 , for given impact parameters . for an impactor with mass @xmath43 and radius @xmath44 and target of mass @xmath5 and radius @xmath23",
    "the impact velocity is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mutual escape velocity .",
    "we therefore find that a collision between comparable mass planets with @xmath47 that about half of the gaseous envelope of both target and impactor is lost .",
    "this yields a final planet with a core mass that is about twice the original mass and an envelope - to - core - mass ratio that is reduced by a factor of two .      to relate this reduction in @xmath48 to observed mean densities we obtained the mean density for planets of various masses for different @xmath48 .",
    "we did this by calculating the contraction of the planet s radius as a function of time and then obtained for a given planet mass and @xmath48 the corresponding radius at an age of 1 gyr ( see section 2.1 details ) .",
    "figure [ fig4]a displays the resulting exoplanet densities as a function of @xmath48 and planet mass from our thermal evolution models .",
    "it shows that a reduction of @xmath48 by a factor of 2 due to a comparable mass merger results in a corresponding increase in the mean density by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "for instance , a planet with @xmath49 and @xmath50 has a mean density of 0.8 @xmath51 .",
    "after a giant impact with an equal mass core that ejects half the envelope mass ( such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , the mean density is @xmath54 , which is an increase by a factor of 3.5 . for a similar collision but for an initial atmosphere of @xmath55 , the resulting mean",
    "density of the final planet is increased by a factor of 2 .",
    "this demonstrates that one or two giant impacts can give rise to a large spread in mean densities . in figure",
    "[ fig4]b , we show a comparison of planet mass vs. mean density of observed exoplanet systems and display as blue dashed lines density contours for various envelope - to - core - mass ratios .",
    "the mean densities we find after @xmath56 of cooling agree with those of @xcite typically to within about 10 - 25% for core masses @xmath57 . at lower core masses",
    "@xmath58 , we find , similar to @xcite , somewhat larger planetary radii than reported by @xcite .",
    "specifically , we find radii that are up to 50% larger than those calculated by @xcite and which result in lower mean densities for small planets .",
    "we suspect that these discrepancies are likely due to the different initial conditions used [ fixed luminosity in this work , fixed entropy in @xcite , and fixed radii in @xcite ] all of which have the greatest impact on the thermal evolution of low mass planets @xmath59 .",
    "we note that our density results for neptune - mass planets with low mean densities suggest that these planets possess roughly 20% of their mass in gaseous envelopes .",
    "this is interesting because planets with envelope mass fractions in excess of about 20% are expected to undergo runaway gas accretion leading to the formation of a gas giant instead @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that giant impacts between similarly - sized planets can easily reduce the envelope - to - core - mass ratio by factors of two and that this leads to an increase in mean density by factors of 2 - 3 . since late giant impacts",
    "are frequently needed to achieve long - term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has disappeared @xcite , we propose here that a small number of giant impacts may have given rise to the large spread observed in mean densities . furthermore , giant impacts naturally yield a large diversity in densities in a given planetary system , because they are stochastic in nature and because typically only a small number of giant impacts is needed to achieve long - term stability .",
    "we suggest that the observed diversity in densities amongst members of multiplanet systems such as kepler-11 , kepler-20 , kepler-36 , kepler-48 , and kepler-68 may be the result of such late - stage giant impacts",
    ".    the envelope - mass - loss that we calculate in section 2 may be enhanced by photo - evaporation and via a parker wind @xcite both of which should most strongly affect planets with low surface gravity on small semi - major axis @xcite . as the number of mass measurements increases for planets at larger semi - major axis one should be able to disentangle the contribution of envelope - mass - loss due to or enhanced by photo - evaporation and that due to collisions . the fact that figure 1 shows a large spread in mean densities for low stellar fluxes already suggests that photo - evaporation is likely not the main cause for this diversity ."
