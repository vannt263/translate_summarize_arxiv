    "gravitational lensing is the study of the effects of matter on the propagation of light .",
    "the most obvious observational results are the production of multiple images ( as first seen with the multiply imaged quasar 0957 + 561 by walsh , carswell & weymann ) , the creation of giant luminous arcs ( first identified in the galaxy clusters abell 370 and cl  2244 by lynds & petrosian and , independently , in abell 370 by soucail et al . ) and the large magnifications of source flux seen in microlensing events ( for example , brightening of a single image of the multiply - imaged quasar 2237 + 0305 due to compact objects in the lensing galaxy , first detected by irwin et al . ) .    the paths of light rays from a source to the observer",
    "are conveniently described with the gravitational lens equation ( below ) .",
    "this equation is highly non - linear , so that , except for a small number of specific cases , there are no analytic solutions . in particular , there is no straightforward result which determines the image locations or magnifications for an ensemble of many lenses .",
    "this presents a serious problem when we wish to study the lensing properties of a complex lensing structure such as the universe .",
    "fortunately , a number of approximate numerical methods have been developed which allow us to calculate magnifications and other properties of a collection of lenses .",
    "foremost amongst these are the ray shooting methods , introduced by paczyski and kayser , refsdal & stabell and developed by schneider & weiss , kayser et  al . and lewis et al . .",
    "for a discussion of other methods , such as the use of a scalar deflection potential , and the optical scalar equations , see schneider , ehlers & falco .    in this paper , we present an alternative technique for calculating the magnification properties of an ensemble of lenses  the ray bundle method ( rbm ) .",
    "the rbm is particularly well suited to studies of the weak lensing limit , where we are not concerned with the creation of multiple ( comparably bright ) images . like the ray shooting method",
    ", the rbm uses backwards propagation of light rays from the observer to the source , which are deflected by the distribution of lenses , and are mapped to the source plane . whereas the ray shooting method collects the deflected light rays within a rectangular grid of pixels , we consider an infinitesimal bundle of rays which form a circular image , and maintain this association to the source plane .    at first sight ,",
    "the ray bundle method may seem to be less computationally efficient than the ray shooting method , as a grid based technique lends itself to ( fast ) hierarchical calculations @xcite .",
    "however instead of requiring @xmath0 light rays per source grid to reduce the statistical error , we need only use a bundle of @xmath1 rays to obtain magnifications which are correct to better than 5 per cent for an equivalent source size .    with a ray shooting method , we have both image and source pixels , but can not easily determine the correspondence between them . by keeping track of the individual light bundles with the rbm",
    ", we are able to monitor the shape distortions of the beam caused by the shear and convergence of a lens ensemble .",
    "this is of particular interest when the rbm is applied to multiple lens plane geometries ( as are conventionally used for studying cosmologically distributed lenses ) .",
    "details of the beam shape allows for the opportunity to make comparisons between results calculated with the gravitational lens equation , and those using the optical scalar equations ( which are more easily applied to smooth mass distributions , or approximate mass distributions such as the swiss cheese model @xcite ) .    in",
    "we introduce various basic results of gravitational lensing , particularly with regards to magnification and the magnification probability distribution .",
    "the ray bundle method is introduced in and compared in detail with analytic solutions for the schwarzschild lens model . by obtaining the magnification probability distribution with both the ray bundle and ray shooting methods for a variety of lens geometries",
    ", we demonstrate the general applicability of the rbm .",
    "we do not discuss applications of the rbm here , but reserve details for fluke , webster & mortlock ( in preparation ) where the ray bundle method is used to investigate weak lensing within realistic cosmological models ( generated with n - body simulations ) .",
    "we present here a number of important results from gravitational lensing which we will require : the gravitational lens equation , the magnification of source flux and the magnification probability distribution .",
    "several excellent sources exist which describe gravitational lensing far more comprehensively than may be discussed here , for example schneider et  al . and",
    "narayan & bartelmann .",
    "the deflection of a light ray by a massive object is conveniently expressed with the gravitational lens equation ( gle ) , which may be derived from simple geometrical arguments ( as demonstrated in ) .",
    "the gle relates the impact parameter , @xmath2 , in the lens ( deflector ) plane , the source position , @xmath3 , in the source plane and the deflection angle , @xmath4 , of the light ray : @xmath5 the distances ( @xmath6 ) in are angular diameter distances between the [ o]bserver , [ d]eflector and [ s]ource planes . for a given source position ,",
    "an image will occur for each value of @xmath2 which is a solution of .",
    "we define the lens axis as the line from the observer through a single lens ( at the origin of the lens plane ) , and which is perpendicular to both the lens and source planes .",
    "the gle may be recast into a dimensionless form by introducing the scaling lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "defining @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the dimensionless deflection angle @xmath11 it follows that @xmath12      for a bundle of light rays passing through a transparent lens , the number of photons is conserved , ie .",
    "gravitational lensing does not change the specific intensity of the source .",
    "a change in flux , however , can occur as the cross - sectional area of a bundle of light rays will be affected by a gravitational lens .",
    "the change in the apparent luminosity is entirely due to the change in the solid angle that the image covers ( at the expense of the rest of the sky )  with a lens present , more photon trajectories are brought to the observer s eye than if there were no lens @xcite .",
    "if the flux at a frequency @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the specific intensity and @xmath16 is the solid angle subtended by the source at the observer s location , then the magnification is @xmath17 with primes denoting quantities when the lens is absent .",
    "it is usual to measure the magnification with respect to either a ` full beam ' or an ` empty beam ' .",
    "the full beam refers to the case where matter is smoothly distributed everywhere ( inside and outside of a bundle of light rays ) , so that there is no shear and the magnification is due entirely to convergence .",
    "an empty beam corresponds to the case where there is a smooth distribution of matter ( on average ) external to the beam , and no matter within the beam .",
    "the empty beam is the maximally divergent beam , as there is now no magnification due to convergence , and the minimum magnification is @xmath18 .",
    "the addition of material outside of the beam will result in a total magnification @xmath19 due to shear @xcite . in the work that follows , we will calculate magnifications with respect to an empty beam .",
    "the ( differential ) magnification probability , @xmath20 , is the probability that the total magnification of a source at redshift @xmath21 will lie in the range @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the probability is subject to the constraints @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean magnification . for a universe where the matter is smoothly distributed , @xmath27 , while for the empty beam magnifications considered here , @xmath28 . provides the normalisation of the probability , while expresses the conservation of flux @xcite .",
    "these constraints are only strictly true when we consider the magnification probability over the whole sky  in the tests we conduct here , we use artificial lens distributions that do not cover the entire celestial sphere .",
    "the probability distribution provides a straightforward way of making a comparison between different techniques for solving the gle . although we might expect the calculation of the magnification along a particular line - of - sight to vary slightly ( depending on source geometry , etc ) , the statistical properties of a distribution of sources should be essentially independent of the method .    in practice",
    ", we will use a histogram of the probability as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "this involves summing over a range of magnifications from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , so that each histogram bin represents @xmath31 in the following , we will refer to this as the magnification probability histogram ( mph ) .",
    "the gle is highly non - linear , and in general there are multiple solutions for the image locations for a single source position . as a result , analytic solutions ( where we can invert the gle to solve for all @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 ) exist for only special lens geometries and models , which may not always be realistic or practical . instead",
    ", various numerical methods have been developed which enable solutions to the lens equation to be found accurately and efficiently .",
    "some of the most widely used methods are those based on the concept of ray shooting .",
    "the basic principle of the ray shooting method ( rsm ) is to use to propagate light rays backwards from the observer through a sequence of one or more lens planes to the source plane , where the rays are collected on a rectangular pixel grid .",
    "typically @xmath32 pixels are required , with an average of @xmath33 rays per source plane pixel . the magnification in each source",
    "pixel @xmath34 is then proportional to the density of rays collected therein : @xmath35    a shooting region in the lens plane is chosen such that only a few rays from outside of this grid are mapped onto one of the sources , otherwise there would be missing flux . by using a uniform grid of image rays , the relative error is approximately @xmath36 @xcite , which is better than the poisson error if a random distribution of image rays was used ( however a regular grid may introduce systematic errors ) . as a consequence of this error , it is possible to get magnifications @xmath37 , violating the condition on the total magnification ( ) , which is entirely a numerical effect .",
    "early versions of this method were introduced by paczyski and kayser et  al . and developed by schneider & weiss and kayser et  al . .",
    "hierarchical tree methods were applied to microlensing scenarios by wambsganss and wambsganss , paczyski & katz .",
    "the hierarchical methods approximate the effects of lenses which are far from a light ray , and allow the inclusion of many thousands of lenses at a low computational cost ( o(@xmath38 ) for a tree - code with n lenses , versus o(@xmath39 ) when the contribution of every lens is explicitly calculated ) .",
    "an improvement on conventional ray shooting methods for obtaining statistical properties of microlensing light curves can be made with the efficient one - dimensional contour following algorithm of lewis et al . .",
    "we now introduce the ray bundle method as an alternative to the rsm .",
    "the ray bundle method ( rbm ) is similar to the rsm , in that the lens equation is used to propagate light rays backwards from the observer to the source plane .",
    "however we now consider a bundle consisting of a central ray ( the null geodesic ) surrounded by @xmath40 light rays , which create an image shape ( usually circular ) .",
    "as the ray bundle passes through the lens distribution , its shape will be distorted due to shear ( stretching along an axis ) and convergence ( focusing due to matter within the beam ) . for an ` infinitesimal ' ray bundle ,",
    "the magnification is determined from by calculating the area of the bundle in the image plane ( @xmath41 ) and the source plane ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "since we are using backwards ray - tracing through a single image position , we do not know where other images may occur  hence any measurement of the magnification using the rbm will underestimate the total magnification .",
    "however , this is only a significant problem when we consider images located near the critical curves , when the contribution to the total magnification due to any other images becomes important ( see below ) .",
    "the rbm was developed for applications in the weak lensing limit , and should be used with caution for strong lensing cases .",
    "we can investigate the validity of the rbm by comparison with the various analytic solutions which exist for the schwarzschild lens ( see for a summary ) .",
    "consider first a circular source of radius @xmath43 with centre at @xmath44 .",
    "the circumference of the source is then described by the set of vectors @xmath45 with @xmath46 where @xmath47 .    for each @xmath48",
    ", we can solve for the two solutions , @xmath49 , with . in this case",
    "we are using the gle to map from the source plane to the image plane . a source",
    "far from the lens axis produces one highly demagnified image ( @xmath50 ) located near the lens axis ( at @xmath51 ) .",
    "the second image will have a magnification @xmath52 , and an angular position near the source ( at @xmath53 ) .",
    "as the source is moved towards the lens axis , the images are stretched in the tangential direction , which corresponds to a tangential critical curve at @xmath54 ( the einstein ring ) . ] and become comparable in brightness ( @xmath55 as @xmath56 ) . when @xmath57 , the two images merge into a highly magnified ring ( the einstein ring ) with total magnification given by .",
    "now consider a circular image of radius @xmath58 centred on the location of the bright image , @xmath59 , with circumferential points @xmath60 @xmath61 this time , the gle maps in the opposite direction  from the image plane to the source plane .",
    "the source shape we obtain is stretched along the radial direction , and differentially compressed in the tangential direction .",
    "demonstrates the differences between the shape and locations of a circular source ( solid line ) , for which the circumferential points may be determined for both images , and a circular image and its corresponding source ( short dashed line ) . in this example , we have considered a source which is near the einstein radius where strong lensing effects dominate , and there may be a significant contribution to the flux from the second image . in all cases where we will apply the rbm , the image is chosen to be well away from the einstein radius ( critical curve ) , and so the flux lost from the second image is not important , as we now show .",
    "we now look at how accurately the rbm approximates the total magnification , even though it includes the contribution of only one image .",
    "if we set @xmath62 , as we expect only small changes to the shape and hence radius of the image in the weak lensing limit ( @xmath63 ) , then this is a two parameter problem ( @xmath64 ) .    defining the rbm magnification in terms of the ray bundle image and source areas ( @xmath65 ) as @xmath66 and the true ( total ) magnification as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the areas of the two images , then the relative error in @xmath70 is @xmath71    due to the circular symmetry of the schwarzschild lens model , we need only determine the radius , @xmath72 , within which the rbm produces a relative error @xmath73 per cent .    by using @xmath40 rays in the image and source bundles",
    ", we are approximating the shape of a circular image / source by a polygon with @xmath40 sides .",
    "clearly , when @xmath74 , we will have a reasonable approximation to the true shape of the image / source .",
    "however , to improve the speed of the ray bundle method ( at the cost of a small error ) , we ideally want to select a small value of @xmath40 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the areas are calculated as a sum of triangular components within the image / source polygon , where each triangle has a common vertex at @xmath76 or @xmath77 ( ie .",
    "the null geodesic ) .",
    "we need to first check that the calculated @xmath78 is not significantly in error using a particular value of @xmath40 .",
    "this was achieved by numerically integrating , and comparing with @xmath78 for @xmath79 . the relative error in @xmath78",
    "was found to be independent of the choice of @xmath40 , and was well below the percentage cut - off level selected for @xmath70 at the same radii .",
    "for source positions which are near the lens axis , it is difficult to keep track of which solutions @xmath80 belong to which of the images , particularly when merging of images is taking place . in these cases",
    ", @xmath78 is a misnomer , as it can be significantly higher than the total magnification from , as may be seen in .",
    "@xmath70 is subject to a similar error , as the areas here are also being calculated on the basis of @xmath40 rays .",
    "we can proceed under the assumption that @xmath78 is sufficiently accurate for comparison with @xmath70 when the two images are separable .    by randomly selecting @xmath81 source ( rbm image ) locations ,",
    "we calculate @xmath78 and @xmath70 .",
    "shows the dimensionless radius , @xmath72 , within which @xmath82  per  cent for a range of source radii ( @xmath83 ) . for a given value of the relative error , these results are essentially independent of both the source radii and @xmath40 in the range @xmath79 .",
    "the choice of @xmath1 appears to be the best compromise between accuracy and speed for our later investigations of the rbm .",
    "the smaller @xmath40 , the fewer total deflection calculations which need to be made , yet we retain high accuracy for @xmath70 in the weak lensing limit . with 8 rays",
    ", we have a symmetric image with a quadrupole component , so it is possible to determine the distribution of image ellipticities .    in , we plot @xmath70 ( thick solid line ) , @xmath78 ( thin solid line ) and @xmath84 , the solution of ( dashed line ) , as functions of the source impact parameter ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the source / image bundle radius in this case was @xmath86 .",
    "we have used a larger radius than would be practical for the rbm in order to show in more detail what the high magnification behaviour is like near @xmath87 . as",
    "the source is comparable in size to the einstein radius , the calculated magnifications near @xmath88 are noisy . in this case",
    ", a circular source should produce a pair of highly distorted arcs , but this is not well represented by the use of triangular components within the ray bundle ( ie .",
    "parity changes can occur in the individual triangles which make up the bundle ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line shows where the relative error in @xmath70 is accurate to @xmath89 per cent , at @xmath90 or @xmath91 ( note that these values are higher than in due to the larger source radius ) .",
    ".[tbl : fluxlost ] position of source , @xmath92 , at which the relative error in @xmath70 ( compared to the true magnification ) is first @xmath93  per  cent , caused by neglecting flux from second image .",

    "values in the table are for source radii @xmath94 and @xmath79 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     a cut - off was imposed on image locations for the rbm at @xmath95 einstein radii .",
    "the two distributions are qualitatively very similar , when the various caveats described above are considered .",
    "imposing a larger value of @xmath72 serves to reduce the maximum magnification with the rbm . the poor sampling in the highest @xmath22 bins for the rsm is clearly demonstrated .",
    "the dashed line shows the expected @xmath96 power law slope of the mph at large @xmath22 ( see ) , and both distributions have this approximate form ( although for the rsm the statistical significance of the histogram bins with @xmath97 is low ) .",
    "as expected , the rsm produces magnifications which are @xmath98 ( when @xmath99 is expected ) due to numerical effects .",
    "the sample mean and variance of the two distributions are @xmath100 and @xmath101 for ray shooting , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the ray bundle method , see end of ) . ] .",
    "the ray shooting method provides higher accuracy at high magnifications , but at magnifications @xmath104 , the ray bundle method is more accurate _ even though _ flux from additional images is neglected .",
    "one aspect of the mph we have not yet discussed has to do with the weighting we apply to each ray bundle .",
    "for the rsm , every source is a pixel with the same area . for the rbm ,",
    "the initial ray bundles ( images ) have the same area , but the resulting sources must have different areas ( by the definition of a magnification ) .",
    "it is sufficient to weight each ray bundle in the mph by the area of the resulting source .",
    "shows the rbm ( thin line ) with no weighting compared with the correct area weighting ( thick line ) .      for an ensemble of @xmath105 lenses in the lens plane , each with mass @xmath106 , the total deflection angle generalises to @xmath107 where the @xmath108 are the impact parameters to each lens .",
    "consider the case where lenses are restricted to lie within a rectangular region .",
    "light rays passing through one of the corners of the shooting region will necessarily be deflected inwards by the mass distribution .",
    "this is appropriate for an isolated configuration of lenses , such as in studies of the microlensing effect of many stars which make up a galaxy ( where the contribution to the deflection by an external mass distribution may be modelled by adding a shear term to the lens equation ) .",
    "however , for an investigation of the lensing due to large scale structure , where the mass distribution is assumed to be continuous and homogeneous in all directions about a ray , we may introduce an artificial shear on rays near the shooting boundary .",
    "for the rbm , we choose to calculate each of the deflection angles explicitly , with an increase in the computational time over an equivalent hierarchical method . by making the direct calculation of the deflection",
    ", we are free to choose the geometry of the region within which we include lenses .",
    "the most natural choice for a distribution which is homogeneous and isotropic beyond some length scale @xmath109 is to include lenses within a circular region around each ray out to the radius @xmath110 . for the isolated lens geometries we examine here ,",
    "we need only set @xmath111 to encompass the rsm image plane .",
    "a discussion of the appropriate choice for @xmath109 in cosmological lensing scenarios is reserved for fluke et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    as a final test here , we now consider a random distribution of @xmath112 lenses ( with the same lens positions for both the rsm and rbm ) .",
    "the resulting mph is shown in and various parameters in .",
    "for both methods we use a total of @xmath113 bundles / sources , but discarding bundles within @xmath114 einstein radii for the rbm reduces this to @xmath115 bundles for the histogram .",
    "the sample mean and variance are @xmath116 , @xmath117 for the rbm and @xmath100 , @xmath118 for the rsm .",
    "using an ensemble of lenses introduces a new length scale to the problem , so that sub - structure at intermediate magnifications ( @xmath119 ) is seen in the mph using the rsm ( but not with the rbm ) .",
    "the ` bump ' in the mph occurs for a planar distribution of lenses , and has been studied both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite , and is believed to be due to the caustic patterns of pairs of point lenses . if this is a caustic - induced feature , ie . a region of high magnification ,",
    "then the rbm will not provide the ` correct ' magnification .",
    "we feel the feature may be in part due to the low resolution with which the complex caustic structure was mapped with the rsm on a regular grid ( @xmath120 pixels ) , however a discussion of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the ray bundle method provides a computationally fast , accurate and flexible alternative to the ray shooting method for studies of the weak gravitational lensing limit .",
    "a wide variety of lens models are easily incorporated  we have considered here only the case of the schwarzschild lens , but changing to a different model involves modifying only @xmath121 in the gle .",
    "one alternative to ray based methods requires solving for the scalar lensing potential , but it may not always be possible to find an analytic solution for all lens models .",
    "the rbm also allows us to avoid artificial shear introduced by grid based methods for light rays which pass near the shooting boundary , when a small portion of an otherwise homogeneous and isotropic distribution is used .",
    "the point source limit may be approached as values of @xmath58 may be selected without the restriction of introducing a finer source grid , and a corresponding increase in the density of rays required ( provided we can relax the constraint that the source plane must be completely covered by sources with the rbm ) .",
    "the rbm should only be applied with caution to strong lensing scenarios , where the rsm is far superior . as only one image",
    "is followed to the source , there will be an error in the total magnification when the image is near a critical curve .",
    "the rbm is , however , particularly well suited to problems were we want to investigate in detail individual lines - of - sight for various lens geometries and models .",
    "an important advantage of the rbm is that we can associate a particular image position and shape with the corresponding source position and shape .",
    "this provides us with the opportunity of following the development of the shape of a ray bundle through a sequence of lens planes , as used in models of cosmological lensing ( for example , wambsganss , cen & ostriker ) .",
    "an important application of weak lensing is to determine the effect of small changes in the magnification of standard candle sources ( such as type ia supernovae ) on the derived values of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the high accuracy of the rbm in the weak lensing limit makes it a value tool for such studies .",
