    "we consider euclidean type iia string theory , compactified on an arbitrary calabi - yau manifold @xmath0 . around @xmath0 , we wrap one or more euclidean ns five - branes , so that these objects are pointlike in the remaining four directions .",
    "we turn on a background rr - field @xmath1 which satisfies @xmath2 along the directions of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we take a double scaling limit where we send both the distance between the five - branes and the string coupling constant to zero in such a way that their ratio becomes infinite .",
    "the reason to study this system is twofold .",
    "first of all , the world - volume theory on an ns - five - brane is the so - called little string theory , which is still not completely understood . as shown by giveon and kutasov @xcite , in the above double scaling limit this theory turns into a weakly coupled field theory .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the partition function of this system could teach us something about little string theory . secondly , in calabi - yau compactifications there are instanton corrections to several four - dimensional quantities , coming from wrapped ns five - branes .",
    "our computation could be helpful in determining these instanton corrections .",
    "the bosonic part of the low - energy field theory on the ns five - brane contains a self - dual two - form field and five scalar fields . for clarity",
    ", we will not take the fermions  which are completely determined by supersymmetry  into consideration here .",
    "also , the scalar fields do not contribute to the classical partition function .",
    "four of them , corresponding to the position of the ns five - brane , are fixed while the fifth one can not have any winding numbers since the calabi - yau does not have any closed one - cycles .",
    "therefore , we want to study the classical partition sum of a self - dual two - form @xmath3 coupled to a flat background three - form field @xmath1 . ignoring the subtleties of the self - duality ,",
    "this system can be described by the action @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the field strength of the two - form field .",
    "the field @xmath6 has quantized fluxes around the conjugate three - cycles @xmath7 , @xmath8 of the calabi - yau : @xmath9 similarly , we denote the ( fixed ) periods of the @xmath1-field around these cycles by @xmath10 , and the fluxes of the holomorphic @xmath11-form on @xmath0 around the @xmath12-cycles ( defining its complex strcture ) are denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "note that the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not quantized .",
    "the partition sum is now a sum over the fluxes @xmath16 , which can be evaluated using a poisson resummation .",
    "it is well - known how to incorporate self - duality in such a calculation @xcite : basically , one has to choose a spin structure @xmath17 on the manifold and take a holomorphic root of the resulting expression .",
    "the result of this somewhat lengthy but straightforward calculation of the classical partition function is @xmath18 i.  e.  a modified theta - function depending on the background field fluxes @xmath19 and on the periods @xmath13 .",
    "the sum over the fluxes @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( only one sum is left because of the holomorphic root ) has turned into the usual sum inside the theta function . for the full expression for @xmath22 ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "it is known that after a transversal t - duality , the ns five - branes ( which are four - dimensional instantons for the @xmath23 field ) , turn into gravitational instantons . more specifically , it has been shown in @xcite that the t - dual system in four dimensions is a taub - nut space ( without five - branes ) which in the limit where we let the compactification circle grow to infinite size becomes an ale - space of type @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of five - branes in the original picture .    comparing the limits on both sides of the t - duality",
    ", we find that the double scaling limit corresponds to a weak coupling limit with small planck length , i.e.  we can use an @xmath26 supergravity approximation on the type iia side .",
    "the three - form field on the calabi - yau obtains a leg in the four remaining directions after the t - duality , so for every three - cycle @xmath7 on the calabi - yau , we obtain a vector field with field strength @xmath27 in the supergravity limit .",
    "( the cycles @xmath8 correspond to the hodge duals of these forms . )",
    "in the @xmath28 supergravity theory , we can again calculate the classical partition function of a single five - brane by summing over the fluxes of the gauge fields @xmath27 , and one finds exactly the result ( [ eq : classicalresult ] ) .",
    "however , the interesting thing is that on this side one can also calculate the quantum contributions to the partition function .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that the supergravity action obtains quantum corrections of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the anti - self - dual part of the curvature , @xmath31 is the anti - self - dual part of the graviphoton field strength ( which is one of the gauge field strengths in our description above ) , and the @xmath32 are topological string amplitudes at genus @xmath33 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the integral over the curvature gives a factor of @xmath34  corresponding to the number of five - branes  and @xmath35 and @xmath31 in our scaling limit combine into an effective coupling constant @xmath36 , so the final result for the partition function of a single five - brane is @xmath37",
    "two important open questions arise from our calculations .",
    "first of all , since @xmath25 five - branes correspond to an @xmath24-singularity , it is not clear what happens in the case of a single five - brane .",
    "in fact , the result we get for @xmath25 five - branes in the coulomb phase on the supergravity side seems to be the @xmath38 power of the result ( [ eq : fullresult ] ) . in our paper @xcite , we give some arguments for the fact that there is indeed a `` missing five - brane '' at infinity in the supergravity calculation .",
    "however , it would be nice to see this explicitly , for example by doing the calculation on the taub - nut space instead of the ale space .",
    "the second open problem stems from the fact that the classical and quantum parts of [ eq : fullresult ] satisfy conjugate `` holomorphic anomaly equations '' @xcite , i.  e.  they are not truly holomorphic quantities in @xmath15 , but they are holomorphic in a background independent sense as explained by witten in @xcite .",
    "integrating over the c - field fluxes @xmath14 would give a truly holomorphic result .",
    "it would be nice to understand these facts and the relation to topological theories better ."
