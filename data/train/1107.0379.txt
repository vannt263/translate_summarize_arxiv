    "then the set of berge knots of types vii @xcite ( the set of berge knots of types viii , respectively ) is the set of @xmath13 and their mirror images ( the set of @xmath14 and their mirror images , respectively ) .",
    "berge knots of types vii and viii are characterized that they can be situated on the fiber surfaces of the trefoil and the figure eight knot respectively .",

    "moreover since @xmath29 is invertible , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also invertible .",
    "hence we study hyperbolicity and identification problem of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath30 .",
    "t.  saito and m.  teragaito @xcite asked hyperbolicity of @xmath0 , and showed that some infinite sequences of the knots are hyperbolic by using the necessary and sufficient condition for hyperbolicity of a berge knot due to saito @xcite , and by elementary number theoretical results on fibonacci series . in the present paper , we show that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are hyperbolic for @xmath30 ( theorem [ thm : hyp ] ) .",

    "* theorem 1.1 ) , it is shown that there are infinite pairs of two distinct knots in @xmath31 whose same integer surgeries yield homeomorphic lens spaces ( theorem [ thm : st ] ) . we point out that the resulting lens space up to orientations by an odd integer surgery along a hyperbolic berge knot of type vii or viii identifies the standard parameter and the knot itself up to mirror images ( lemma [ lm : lens ] , corollary [ co : mirror ] ) . we show that a pair of the odd surgery coefficient and the degree of the alexander polynomial , which is equivalent to the seifert genus in this case , identifies a berge knot of type vii or viii up to mirror images ( theorem [ thm : detect ] , corollary [ co : pg ] ) .",
    "y.  yamada @xcite defined @xmath0 and @xmath1 for every coprime pair @xmath7 , and discussed equivalence among them up to orientations and mirror images . for every element of the extended class , there is one representative with @xmath22 ( see lemma [ lm : primitive ] ( 3 ) ) .",
    "since a double torus knot is strongly invertible , a non - trivial torus knot is non - amphicheiral , and a non - torus knot yielding a lens space is non - amphicheiral by the cyclic surgery theorem @xcite , the extended class can be also classified completely ( see also remark [ rem : yam ] ( 2 ) ) .",
    "we ask whether one of the odd surgery coefficient @xmath32 and the half of the degree of the alexander polynomial @xmath33 of a berge knot of type vii or viii determines uniquely the standard parameter or not . for the case of @xmath32 ,",
    "we give the complete answer which has been already described in @xcite by a theory of quadratic fields ( lemma [ lm : prime ] ) .",
    "we make a complete table of @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 for @xmath35 . by the table",
