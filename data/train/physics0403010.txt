    "in the present paper we consider the statement of the flow problem of barotropic fluid .",
    "if compressibility of the fluid tends to zero , we obtain an incompressible fluid .",
    "we consider the incompressible fluid as a special case of the barotropic fluid , when its compressibility tends to zero . in the passage to limit the dynamic equations , describing evolution of density @xmath0 and that of the velocity potential @xmath1 , lose temporal derivatives and turn into constraints on the state of the incompressible fluid .",
    "@xmath2 as a result the statement of the flow problem appears to be different for barotropic fluid and for the incompressible one . on one hand , the description of the incompressible fluid is simpler , than that of barotropic one . on the other hand ,",
    "the incompressible fluid is a nonphysical fluid , because the speed of sound is infinite , and constraints on the state of the incompressible fluid appear to be nonphysical constraints . as a result",
    "the statement of the flow problem for the incompressible fluid appears to be complicated , than for the barotropic one .",
    "nonstationary flows are too difficult for calculations , and as a rule one considers stationary flows , which do not contain temporal derivatives .",
    "this fact complicates statement of the flow problem , because the problem can not be considered to be an evolutional problem .",
    "finally , the rotational stationary flows are too difficult for calculation also , and one considers usually stationary irrotational flows of the incompressible fluid . statement of the problem for rotational flows of the incompressible fluid and for the irrotational ones appear to be quite different . in particular , the stationary irrotational flow of incompressible fluid is determined uniquely by the boundary conditions .",
    "the rotational stationary flow may contain stream lines , which do not cross the boundaries , and one can not set the flow problem , using only boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the statement of the flow problem , starting from the simple case of the arbitrary flow of the barotropic fluid , when the statement of the problem is very simple .",
    "imposing in series the constraints of incompressibility and of stationary , we follow the evolution of the flow problem statement .",
    "in our investigation we use essentially the fact that dynamic equations for the ideal barotropic fluid can be integrated @xcite .",
    "indefinite functions appear in dynanic equations as a result of this integration . as a rule ,",
    "the investigation of integrals of differential equations is simpler and more effective , than the investigation of differential equations themselves , and we use this circumstance .",
    "integration of hydrodynamic equations is connected closely with a use of generalized stream function ( gsf ) @xcite and with gsf - technique which allows one to realize this integration .",
    "we obtain hydrodynamic equations for barotropic fluid from the variational principle , which can be written in the form @xcite @xmath3=\\int \\left\\ {   \\frac{\\mathbf{j}^{2}}{2\\rho } -\\rho e - p_{k}\\left ( j^{k}-\\rho _ { 0}\\left (   \\mathbf{\\xi } \\right ) \\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial \\xi _ { 0,k}}\\right ) \\right\\ } dtd\\mathbf{x }   \\label{h1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the 4-flux of the fluid , @xmath0 is the density and @xmath5 is its velocity .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the fluid internal energy per unit mass , which depends only on the density @xmath0 .",

    "the quantities @xmath28 are useful , because they satisfy identically to the relations @xmath34 identifying the fluid 4-flux @xmath35 with the quantity @xmath36 @xmath37 we obtain from two first equations ( [ h1.4 ] ) that the 4-flux @xmath35 satisfies the continuity equation @xmath38 here and in what follows a summation over two repeated greek indices is produced @xmath39 .",
    "it follows from the second identity ( [ h1.4 ] ) that the quantities @xmath8 are labels of the fluid particles , and their substantial derivatives vanish @xmath40 a use of designation ( [ h1.5 ] ) is very useful , and we have introduced this designation in the variational principle ( [ h1.1 ] ) by means of the lagrange multipliers @xmath41 ,  @xmath16 .    to obtain hydrodynamic equations we should vary the action ( [ h1.1 ] ) with respect to variables @xmath42 ,  @xmath16 .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is fictitious , and a variation with respect to @xmath33 gives identity .",
    "dynamic equations have the form @xmath43 as far as the variable @xmath33 is fictitious , dynamic equation ( [ h1.8 ] ) with @xmath44 is to be an identity in force of other dynamic equations .",

    "these equations can be solved independently of dynamic equations ( [ h1.23 ] ) , which describe labeling of the fluid particles and the character of the fluid particle motion along its trajectory .",

    "what information is necessary for determination of the unique rotational flow ?",
    "it is believed that in the case of the rotational flow the same information is sufficient as in the case of the irrotational flow .",

    "it is simply equal to zero , and this information is perceived usually as an absence of information .    why is it necessary to give the vorticity in addition to the velocity in the stationary case",
    "? why may we not give the vorticity in the nonstationary case ?",
    "in reality , we need to give the vorticity in both cases , but in the nonstationary case the vorticity is determined by the initial velocity field @xmath226 , given in the whole volume @xmath174 . in the stationary case the velocity is given only on the boundary @xmath173 , and the vorticity can not be determined on the basis of this information . in this case",

    "the vorticity @xmath206 is to be given on any stream line , labeled by @xmath211 , @xmath185 .",
    "if the fluid flow contains closed stream lines , which do not cross the boundary @xmath173 , one can not determine the vorticity @xmath206 on these stream lines , giving boundary conditions . in this case",
    "one needs an additional information other than the boundary condition . we can obtain the stationary flow as a result of establishing process . in this case",
    "we are to give initial velocity @xmath226 in the whole volume @xmath174 , and the vorticity on the closed stream lines is determined by the initial velocity @xmath226 . using different establishing processes ,",
    "we obtain different stationary flows at the same stationary boundary conditions .",
    "experimenters dealing with rotating fluid flows know this fact very well .",

    "finally , equation ( [ h7.4 ] ) can be resolved with respect to @xmath258 in the same way , as the equation ( [ s5.7 ] ) has been resolved with respect to @xmath213 .",
    "we obtain @xmath259 where @xmath196 is some function of arguments @xmath207 and the jacobian @xmath260 is considered as a function of arguments @xmath261 . in particular , if @xmath262 , @xmath263    using relation ( [ h7.12 ] ) or ( [ h7.14 ] ) , we can eliminate variables @xmath258 and @xmath264 from equations ( [ h7.10 ] ) .",
    "we obtain the system of dynamic equations for variables @xmath265 in the two - dimensional space of coordinates @xmath203 with variable @xmath212 , considered as an evolutional variable ( time )",
    ".    equations ( [ h7.10 ] ) , ( [ h7.14 ] ) are rather complicated , especially because of the equation ( [ h7.14 ] ) , which contains the operation of transition from independent variables @xmath266 to independent variables @xmath267",
    ". properties of this operation are investigated slightly .",
    "apparently , this operation is an attribute of incompressible fluid , because this operation is present in dynamic equations ( [ s5.16 ] ) , written in the eulerian coordinates .",
    "indefinite functions @xmath268 describing vorticity are functions of independent variables in the equations ( [ h7.10 ] ) , whereas they are functions of dependent variables in equations ( [ s5.16 ] ) . from this viewpoint the equations ( [ h7.10 ] ) are more convenient for investigation of vortical flows .",
    "we have seen that the statement of the flow problem is more complicated for stationary flows , than for nonstationary ones , although dynamic equations for nonstationary flows are more complicated .",
    "stationary boundary conditions do not destine a unique stationary flow , even if they determine vorticity on any stream line crossing the boundary of the considered flow region .",
