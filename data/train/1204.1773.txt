    "the theory of relativistic hypercomputation ( i.e. , the investigation of relativity theory based physical computational scenarios which are able to solve non - turing - computable problems ) has an extensive literature and it is investigated by several researchers in the past decades , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for an overview of different approaches to hypercomputation ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that hypercomputation is not possible in special relativity in the usual sense ( i.e. , the sense of malament  hogarth spacetimes ) , see , e.g. , @xcite . in this paper , we show that it is possible to perform relativistic hypercomputation via ordinary computers ( turing machines ) in special relativity if there are faster than light ( ftl ) signals , e.g. , particles .",
    "we will also show that there have to be ftl signals if relativistic hypercomputation is possible in special relativity ( via turing machines ) , see thm.[thm - hc ] .",
    "it is interesting in and of itself to investigate the ( logical ) consequences of the assumption that ftl objects exist , independently of the question whether they really exist or not in our actual physical universe .",
    "logic based axiomatic investigations typically aim for describing all the theoretically possible universes and not just our actual one .",
    "moreover , so far we have not excluded the possibility of the existence of ftl entities in our actual universe ; and from time to time there appear theories and experimental results suggesting the existence of ftl objects .",
    "recently , the opera experiment , see @xcite , raised the interest in the possibility of ftl particles .",
    "contrary to the common belief , the existence of ftl particles does not lead to a logical contradiction within special relativity . for a formal axiomatic proof of this fact , see @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , in contrast with this result , the impossibility of the existence of ftl inertial _ observers _ follows from special relativity , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the investigation of ftl motion in relativity theory goes back ( at least ) to tolman , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since then a great many works dealing with ftl motion have appeared in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to mention only a few .",
    "it is well - known that we can send information back to the past if there are ftl particles , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is natural to try using this possibility to design computers with greater computational power .",
    "we will show that uniformly accelerated relativistic computers can compute beyond the church ",
    "turing barrier via using ftl signals . in this section ,",
    "we show this fact informally . in sect.[sec - hc ] , we reconstruct our informal ideas of this section within an axiomatic theory of special relativity extended with accelerated observers .",
    "our first observation is that if we can send out an ftl signal with a certain speed , we also have to be able to send out arbitrarily fast signals , by the principle of relativity .",
    "prop.[prop - nolim ] is a formal statement of this observation . to informally justify this statement ,",
    "let us assume that we can send out an ftl signal by a certain experiment , say with speed @xmath0 .",
    "according to special relativity , for any ftl speed , say @xmath1 , there is a inertial reference frame ( moving relative to our frame ) according to which our signal moves with this speed . by the principle of relativity , inertial frames are experimentally indistinguishable ,",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , pp.149 - 159 ) , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so the experiment which is configured in our reference frame as our original experiment is seen by this moving inertial frame as yielding an ftl signal moving with speed @xmath1 in our frame .",
    "therefore , in our ( or any other inertial ) reference frame , it is possible to send out an ftl signal with any speed .",
    "let us see the construction of our special relativistic hypercomputer .",
    "let the computer be accelerated uniformly with respect to an inertial observer , see fig.[fig - hc ] .",
    "there is an event @xmath2 with the following property : any event @xmath3 on the worldline of our uniformly accelerated computer is simultaneous with @xmath2 , according to the inertial observer comoving with the computer at @xmath3 , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "let us set the computer to work on some recursively enumerable but non turing - computable problem , say the decision problem for the consistency of zf set theory ; the computer enumerates one by one all the consequences of zf .",
    "let us fix an event @xmath4 on the worldline of the programmer which is later than @xmath2 according to him .",
    "now , if the computer finds a contradiction , let it send out a fast enough signal which reaches the programmer before event @xmath4 .",
    "such signal exists since , by our first observation , the computer can send out a signal which is arbitrarily fast with respect to his coordinate system ( i.e. , any half line in the `` upper '' half space determined by the comoving observer s simultaneity can be the worldline of the signal ) .",
    "therefore , if the programmer receives a signal between events @xmath2 and @xmath4 , he knows that zf is inconsistent ; and if there is no signal between @xmath4 and @xmath2 , he knows that the computer has not found any contradiction , so after event @xmath4 the programmer can conclude that there is no contradiction in zf set theory . the same way , by this thought experiment using ftl signals , we can decide ( experimentally ) any recursively enumerable set of numbers .    if there are no ftl signals , then the whole computation has to happen in the causal past of the event when the programmer learns the result of computation .",
    "however , in special relativity , the computer remaining within the causal past of any event has only finite time to compute by the twin paradox theorem . that is why hypercomputation is not possible in special relativity without ftl signals .",
    "this argument is also the basis of proving that minkowski spacetime is not a malament  hogarth spacetime .",

    "for example , the larger the distance the more difficult to aim with a signal .",
