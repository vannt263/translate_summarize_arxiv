    "energy can be transferred more rapidly between two atoms when the process is _ resonant _ : one atom gives its energy to another , without a change in the kinetic energy of either atom .",
    "although resonant energy transfer often relies on serendipity , the large stark shifts of rydberg atoms may allow the resonant condition to be exactly obtained by application of an electric field @xcite .",
    "the resonant energy transfer process between rydberg atoms is driven by the electric dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "transition dipole moments between nearby rydberg states can be large , typically scaling as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the principal quantum number @xcite . as a consequence , resonant energy transfer collision cross - sections scale as @xmath11 , and are large compared to typical collision cross - sections for less excited atoms  usually by many orders of magnitude @xcite .    stoneman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that the fields at which resonant energy transfer occurs may  under certain conditions ",
    "be used for precise rydberg energy level spectroscopy .",
    "they examined the resonant energy transfer process : @xmath12 , in potassium . since the shifts of the rydberg energy levels with field are relatively well - understood , they were able to use the resonance fields to determine improved zero field atomic energy levels .",
    "in particular , they determined a substantially more precise value for the quantum defect of the @xmath13-series of potassium .",
    "the range of electric fields or `` width '' over which significant resonant energy transfer can be observed is important in this type of experiment , as it dictates the precision to which line centers can be determined . by reducing the spread in the velocity distribution of their sample stoneman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite were able to significantly narrow the width of their observed resonances .    with the development of laser cooling , rydberg atom samples with much narrower velocity distributions",
    "could be studied @xcite . in general , the resulting narrowness of the resonant energy transfer resonances has not been exploited for spectroscopic purposes . instead , work has concentrated on the dynamical aspects of resonant energy transfer between cold rydberg atoms .",
    "for example , carroll _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently studied how the relative orientation of the electric field with respect to the spatial orientation of two rydberg atoms influences their dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "they used cold rb atoms obtained from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) to study the process : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents the stark - states centered around @xmath16 .",
    "the stark states are superpositions of high angular momentum states ( @xmath17 in this case ) exhibiting energy shifts which are linear in the applied electric field strength .",
    "strong resonant energy transfer was observed between @xmath18 to @xmath19 , and was fully explained by a stark map calculation , which took into account the energy shifts of the participating atoms .",
    "however , a series of peaks at approximately @xmath20 were not reproduced in the calculations ( these peaks were not relevant to the main point of their paper ) .    in this paper we demonstrate that the resonances observed at low field are due to the process : @xmath21 which is an allowed electric dipole - dipole interaction , due to the @xmath4 character that the @xmath5 state acquires in the electric field . in the spirit of the work of stoneman _",
    "et al . _",

    "@xcite have reported a preliminary observation of two - photon @xmath22 microwave transitions in @xmath6rb .",
    "however , we are unaware of any other work on the @xmath7 rydberg series of rb .",
    "the essence of the experiment is to measure the electric fields required for efficient resonant energy transfer between cold @xmath1 @xmath6rb atoms . some details of our apparatus",
    "have been previously described @xcite .",
    "a standard vapor cell mot is used as the source of cold @xmath6rb atoms .",
    "these atoms are excited to 32@xmath23 rydberg states using a two - photon , two - color process with 480 nm light , and the nearly resonant , red - detuned 780 nm light used for cooling and trapping .",
    "the 480 nm light is obtained by frequency doubling a 960 nm cw ring ti : sapphire laser , which is frequency stabilized using the technique described in ref .",
    "the experiment is done at a @xmath24 repetition rate , with an acousto - optic modulator used to produce pulses of light .    for energy level determination from resonant energy transfer",
    "spectroscopy it is critical to zero out any stray electric fields , and then be able to apply accurately known electric fields .",
    "two stainless steel electrode plates , separated by @xmath25 , are located to either side of the trapped atoms . by varying the voltages on these plates and the voltage of the rb dispenser source with respect to the grounded chamber ,",
    "it is possible to compensate the stray electric field in all three directions .",
    "the single - photon transition @xmath26 in @xmath6rb is used for this purpose .",
    "this general procedure has been described by osterwalder and merkt @xcite . since the single photon transition is sensitive to magnetic fields , the inhomogeneous magnetic field necessary for mot operation",
    "is shut - off prior to photoexcitation to rydberg states . at the time of the experiment the residual magnetic field inhomogeneity over the sample is less than @xmath27 .",
    "the details of this shutting off procedure are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once the stray electric field is compensated , the plate voltages may be used to produce deliberate fields .",
    "we calibrate these fields by observing the shifted frequencies of the @xmath26 transition and comparing them to the frequencies expected from a stark map calculation @xcite .",
    "the stark map calculation uses the most recent quantum defect data for @xmath6rb @xcite .",
    "although quantum defects for @xmath28 are not known , these do not significantly influence the calculated transition frequencies .    to observe resonant energy transfer between rydberg atoms with known electric fields",
    ", we produce the fields in exactly the same way as during calibration using the @xmath26 transition .",
    "the inhomogeneous magnetic field is also shut - off in an identical manner . after a light excitation pulse of @xmath29 duration",
    ", the electric field is ramped from zero to the desired value in @xmath30 .",
    "the atoms may interact during a waiting period of @xmath31 .",
    "final rydberg state populations after the waiting period are analyzed by selective field ionization ( sfi ) @xcite . in this case",
    "sfi is only able to distinguish states differing by energies equivalent to a change of approximately one principal quantum number .",
    "the 34@xmath32 rydberg states are ionized at a lower field than both the @xmath1 initial states and 30@xmath33 final states . by changing the applied electric field and recording the 34@xmath32 population ,",
    "resonant energy transfer spectra may be obtained ( see fig .",

    "@xcite , using @xmath38 and for @xmath39 , @xmath40 . ]",
    "the striking difference in the three spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra ] is the presence of the low - field resonances in the @xmath1 case , but not in the others .",
    "_  have also observed similar resonances in @xmath41 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but not for @xmath42 ( ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "energetics @xcite rule out the process : @xmath43 as a possible explanation for these low - field resonances .",
    "the final state @xmath44 is at an energy less than the initial state in zero electric field , and this difference increases with increasing field , due to the @xmath4 state polarizability .",
    "there are no processes involving the well - characterized low - angular momentum rydberg states ( @xmath45 ) of rb which would account for the low field resonances in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]c .",
    "we need to consider higher angular momentum states .",
    "the non - penetrating high angular momentum states of rydberg atoms have quantum defects which scale like @xmath46 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "thus a rough estimate of the @xmath7-series quantum defect may be obtained from the @xmath47-series quantum defect @xcite : @xmath48 .",
    "a preliminary calculation with this estimated quantum defect shows that a resonance will occur for the process : @xmath49 at an electric field of @xmath50 .",
    "this is very close to the lowest field resonance observed in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]c .",
    "however for the @xmath34 case , the energy of the two - atom state @xmath51 is less than the initial state @xmath52 , and this difference increases with increasing field ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : spectra]b ) .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of observed low - field resonances in the @xmath34 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]a ) .    in the case of the @xmath35 ,",
    "the electric field does shift @xmath53 closer in energy to @xmath54 .",
    "however , the @xmath55 state reaches the @xmath56 stark manifold at approximately the same field ( fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]f ) .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observations in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]e .    the calculations in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra ] consider only @xmath57 magnetic sublevels .",
    "however , electric fields break the magnetic sublevel energy degeneracy ; therefore , there should be different resonance fields corresponding to the different possible magnetic sublevels for the states in eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] .",
    "the largest splittings are due to the magnetic sublevels of @xmath58 .",
    "the four peaks observed at low fields in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]c correspond to @xmath59 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ( the @xmath59 0 and 1 resonances are unresolved ) . the splittings due to the magnetic sublevels of the other states are much less than the widths of each of these four peaks .",
    "similarly , the three peaks observed between 0.6 and @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]e correspond to the magnetic sublevels of @xmath55 .",
    "all four observable resonances should be explainable by the same @xmath7-series quantum defect ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "figure [ fg : fine]a illustrates calculated resonance fields as a function of a variable @xmath61 , centered around the estimated @xmath62 ( see above ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : fine ] , all four resonances are consistent with the same quantum defect , to better than the widths of the resonances .",
    "we consider this as strong evidence that the process in eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] is the explanation for the low field resonances .",
    "a ) resonance fields calculated for variable @xmath61 ( vertical axis ) .",
    "the five lines correspond to different magnetic sub - levels ( @xmath63 ) for the @xmath58 state .",
    "the calculated fields are shown on the horizontal axis to allow a direct comparison to the experimental data below .",
    "b ) the same @xmath64 resonant energy transfer spectrum as fig .",
    "[ fg : spectra]c ) , shown on an expanded scale . ]    as fig .",
    "[ fg : fine ] suggests , we can extract an estimate of the quantum defect from each one of these four resonances .",
    "the uncertainty may also be estimated for each of these experimentally determined quantum defects from the derivatives @xmath65 evaluated at the estimated quantum defects ( where @xmath66 is the electric field strength ) .",
    "the electric field zeroing and calibration procedure is estimated to have a @xmath67 uncertainty of less than @xmath68 at the resonance fields . from the four resonances we determine @xmath8 , which is consistent with a preliminary report of @xmath69 from han _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "as demonstrated , energetics strongly support eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] as the explanation for the low - field resonances .",
    "however , what drives this process ?",
    "resonant energy transfer between rydberg atoms is typically a dipole - dipole interaction , with the coupling between the two - atom states given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the separation of the two atoms , @xmath72 is a unit vector pointing between them , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are _ transition _ dipole moments evaluated on each of the individual atoms ( a and b ) . in zero electric field the process given in eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] can not be driven by the dipole - dipole interaction , since @xmath75 , given the @xmath76 selection rule for transition dipole moments .",
    "however , when a weak electric field is applied , the @xmath77 quantum number is no longer good .",
    "instead , it serves to label the dominant character of a state until it reaches the stark manfold . in particular",
    ", the mixing of @xmath58 with @xmath78 gives @xmath79 at @xmath3 , where @xmath80 is the atomic unit of electric dipole moment .",
    "the @xmath1 to @xmath81 coupling is allowed in zero field , and is much stronger .",
    "for example at @xmath3 , @xmath82 ( which differs little from its zero field value ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the expected signal strengths for the resonance in eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] with other resonances that have been studied in similar experimental set - ups .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we compare our transition dipole moments to those for the @xmath6rb , @xmath83 process observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we would expect to have to wait approximately 10 times longer to see the equivalent amount of collision signal ( at the same density ) . since typical waiting times are @xmath84 in ref .",
    "@xcite _ vs. _  @xmath31 in our case , this is consistent .    in the quasi - static picture",
    "@xcite the collision signal is expected to scale with the square of the density for a dipole - dipole interaction , and to a higher power for higher - order multipole processes ( for small collision signals ) .",
    "experimentally , we observe square law behavior",
    ". it does not appear necessary to consider higher - order multipole interactions ( see , for example , ref .",
    "resonant energy transfer spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a useful tool for the determination of unknown energy levels differences . in particular ,",
    "prior to the work of han _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , no spectroscopy of the rb @xmath7-series had been performed .",
    "although resonant energy transfer spectroscopy is not a general technique for the determination of energy levels , there may be more possibilities for the observation of resonances than previously thought .",
    "in particular , at first glance the resonance studied in this paper ( eq .",
    "[ eq : us ] ) does not appear to be allowed by the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "however , the mixing of the @xmath5-state with the nearby @xmath4-state allows this process to be observed .",
    "it is expected that similar scenarios exist in rb and other atoms .",
    "microwave transitions have been used to calibrate the applied electric fields in this work .",
    "however , there is a great deal of flexiblity in the particular transition ( and corresponding microwave frequency ) that can be used for this calibration .",
    "a precise microwave source is not required for the actual spectroscopic measurement .",
    "this may be considered to be a significant advantage .",
