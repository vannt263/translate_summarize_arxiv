    "we develop an approach to the stability analysis based on an averaging lyapunov criterion .",
    "more precisely , we consider a discrete - time markov chain @xmath8 with values in a general state space which has two components , @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the first component @xmath10 forms a markov chain itself .",
    "we further assume that the markov chain @xmath11 is harris - ergodic , i.e. there exists a unique stationary distribution @xmath12 and , for any initial value @xmath13 , the distribution of @xmath14 converges to the stationary distribution in the total variation norm : @xmath15    in many known models in applied probability , the time evolution of the process describing the state of the system may be expressed as a multi - component markov chain where one of the components is either a markov chains itself ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) or , more generally , behaves asalmost stable \" , changing only relatively slowly , while the other component changes more rapidly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to formulate and prove a stability criterion for the two - component markov chain @xmath16 by making links to an auxiliary markov chain @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence with common distribution @xmath12 .",
    "first , one can recall a standard approach to the stability analysis which may be used for this model and which is based on the following two - step scheme . to simplify the explanation ,",
    "assume that the first - component markov chain @xmath11 is regenerative with regeneration times @xmath19 , so that all values @xmath20 are equal to , say , @xmath21 .",
    "_ step 1_. consider an embedded 2-component markov chain @xmath22 at the regenerative epochs @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 , the sequence @xmath25 also forms a markov chain . for this chain one may show that , under appropriate assumptions and for an appropriate test ( lyapunov ) function @xmath26 , the drift @xmath27 is bounded from above by the same constant for all values of @xmath28 and is also uniformly negative if @xmath28 is outside of a certain `` bounded '' set , and hence this bounded set is positive recurrent . for that",
    ", it is necessary to find or estimate from above the average drift of @xmath29 over a typical cycle , say @xmath30 . by introducing further smoothness condition(s ) , one can then ensure that the markov chain @xmath25 is also harris ergodic .",
    "_ step 2_. according to step 1 , one can say that the markov chain @xmath31 is regenerative , then verify its aperiodicity and conclude that it is harris ergodic .",
    "however , the first step of the proposed scheme may not be implementable if the transition function is not sufficiently smooth ( and , in particular , has discontinuities ) as then it may be difficult to find / estimate the value of the average drift of @xmath32 during a typical cycle .",
    "another approach to proving stability is the use of fluid limits ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and chapter 10 of @xcite ) . to apply this method",
    ", one needs to prove the convergence of an appropriately scaled version of the process , establish the dynamics of the limit , show that these dynamics are in some sense stable and then prove that this `` stability '' of the limit implies stability of the original markov chain .",
    "this is however often rather cumbersome and technically involved and moreover requires additional assumptions on the markov chain .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a different approach which is based on the following idea .",
    "first , we find the ( unique ) stationary distribution @xmath12 for the @xmath2-component .",
    "second , we introduce an auxiliary ( time - homogeneous ) markov chain @xmath33 with transition probabilities @xmath34 this markov chain can also be viewed as an outcome of the following recursive construction of a two - dimensional markov chain @xmath35 whose first components @xmath36 have common distribution @xmath12 .",
    "first , for each @xmath37 , we determine @xmath38 as a random variable which does not depend on all r.v.s @xmath39 , and has distribution @xmath12 .",
    "second , we determine @xmath40 as a random variable which is + ( a ) conditionally independent of @xmath41 given @xmath38 and @xmath42 , and + ( b ) has distribution @xmath43 then , indeed , @xmath33 forms a ( time - homogeneous ) markov chain with transition probabilities given by .    in this paper , we formulate and prove general stability criteria in terms of averaging lyapunov functions .",
    "in particular , we introduce natural conditions for the following implication to hold : if the markov chain @xmath11 is harris ergodic then the markov chain @xmath33 is positive recurrent . the same conditions are then proved to imply that the markov chain @xmath44 is positive recurrent too .",
    "we formulate and prove general stability results ( theorems 1 and 2 ) in section 2 . in theorem 1",
    "we obtain a `` one - dimensional '' result and then in theorem 2 its multivariate analogue . then in section  3 we study the stability of two systems with multiple access random protocols in a changing environment . the proofs for their stability are carried out by applying theorem 2 and using the monotonicity arguments . in these particular scenarios",
    "we also show that the stability conditions are necessary ( if they do not hold , then the system under consideration is unstable ) .",

    "we also assume that the transmission channel is such that , at a given time slot , at most one red and at most one green message may be transmitted .",
    "note also that any single station can not transmit two messages ( red and green ) simultaneously during the same time slot .",
    "summarising , in any time slot , there may be no transmissions at all .",

    "hence the state  @xmath363 may be reached in a finite number of steps from any other state .",
    "now consider the system which differs from the system described above only in the following : we assume here that a station which is transmitting a red message can also attempt a transmission of a green message and , if that happens , these two transmissions collide .    now",

    "the only difference is that one needs to bound the markov chain representing the state of the system under consideration by a markov chain representing the state of the system where each station with an empty green queue transmits a  dummy \" message with probability  @xmath268 .",
    "note that in this case the first component ( counting the number of red messages ) of the initial markov chain describing the state of the system is not a markov chain itself , so theorem  [ th : stability_multi ] can not be applied directly .",
