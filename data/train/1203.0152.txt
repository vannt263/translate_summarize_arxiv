    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an experiment observing at multiple frequencies , one method of separating the signals is to parameterize the synchrotron and dust , and to fit for these components , in addition to the cmb , over the region of sky where galactic emission is lowest . while demonstrated to work for e - mode polarization @xcite , the signal of interest is the much smaller b - mode signal from inflation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a concern with using such methods is that an incorrect model can lead to bias in the estimated cmb signal .",
    "the _ planck _ satellite mission , launched in may 2009 , is measuring the polarization signal of the cmb in seven channels over the frequency range 30 - 353 ghz @xcite . while _ planck _",
    "will produce polarization data , which offer a multitude of opportunities including possible recovery of inflationary b - modes at large scales and greater understanding of the polarized nature of galactic foregrounds , it also comes with great challenges .",
    "for an all - sky experiment like _ planck _ , component separation of the polarization signal is more difficult than for the temperature counterpart , in part because the ratio of the foreground signal to cmb signal is higher .    in many simulated tests of component separation ,",
    "the simulations of the galactic emission are well matched to the model used to describe them . using a bayesian component separation method which allows us to assume different models of the galactic signal , we explore the effect on the recovery of the cmb in varying scenarios of mismatch between the model and simulation .",
    "we use the recovered cmb map and its covariance to estimate two cosmological parameters : the optical depth to reionization , @xmath1 , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", we can directly quantify the bias generated in the parameter estimation as a result of any particular model - simulation mismatch .",
    "both the bayesian component estimation method and the simulated skies used in this paper were first used and described in a previous paper , @xcite .",
    "there we examined the prospects for large - scale polarized map and cosmological parameter estimation with simulated _ planck _ data for a single model - simulation combination .",
    "this paper is a natural extension in which we use the same methods to recover maps and estimate parameters , while varying the simulated data and separation model .",
    "in  [ sec : methods ] , we provide a brief overview of the gibbs sampling method , the subsequent processing of the sampled distribution , and the likelihood estimation method . in  [ sec : psm ] , we explain how the data are simulated .",
    "a detailed account of the mismatch tests that we examine , and their resulting parameter estimates , is then presented in ",

    "we then discuss the results and methods for mitigating possible biases in  [ sec : discuss ] , and conclude in s[sec : conclude ] .",
    "in the bayesian parameter estimation method of foreground removal , the emission models of the cmb and foregrounds are parametrized based on our understanding of their frequency dependence . focusing on polarization analysis , a sampling method",
    "is then used to estimate the marginalized cmb q and u stokes vector maps ( and additionally the marginalized foreground maps ) in every pixel over the sky . in general",
    "this extends template - removal methods to allow for spatial variation of the foreground spectral indices , and was first used to clean wmap polarization data in @xcite . in this analysis , we use healpix @xcite @xmath10 maps containing @xmath11 pixels .",
    "we use a code called _ commander _ ( see @xcite and @xcite ) to perform the gibbs sampling .",

    "as in @xcite , we assume that the polarized galactic emission is dominated by synchrotron and dust emission , arising due to the orientation of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . we define a parametric model for the total sky signal in antenna temperature for a three - component model ( @xmath20 for cmb , @xmath21 for synchrotron emission , and @xmath22 for thermal dust emission ) as @xmath23where @xmath24 are amplitude vectors of length @xmath25 and @xmath26 are diagonal coefficient matrices of side @xmath25 at each frequency .",
    "once our model , and priors on the model parameters , are defined , we estimate the joint cmb - foreground posterior @xmath27 from which we can then obtain the marginalized distribution for the cmb map vector , @xmath28 and similarly for the other model parameters .    for the multivariate problem that we are considering",

    "we are considering constraints from the large - scale reionization bump , using @xmath3675% of the sky .    by varying only the optical depth to reionization , and fixing the temperature anisotropy power at the first acoustic peak ( @xmath37 ) ,",

    "this is significant compared to the @xmath5 b - mode signal , so a bias is expected . similarly for dust , with a pivot at 353  ghz , a dust emissivity index too steep by @xmath162 would underestimate the dust at 100  ghz by up to @xmath163k in antenna temperature ; significant compared to the @xmath5 signal .",
    "this specific case where the prior is systematically different to the input by up to 1@xmath88 everywhere on the sky is a pessimistic scenario , but not implausible . to avoid the risk of bias",
    ", one must therefore take care in how the foreground model is parameterized . in the bayesian framework",
    ", our chosen model has too many free parameters , given the low signal - to - noise ratio , so the result is being driven by the prior . to mitigate this",
    ", there are several ways of increasing the signal - to - noise ratio in the indices : including ancillary data from complementary experiments like _ wmap _ and _ c - bass _ @xcite , assuming common temperature and polarization spectral indices , using larger pixels to define the indices , or defining spectral indices in harmonic space to allow spatial coherence .",
    "we consider two of these possible improvements .",
    "each three - degree pixel can have a distinct spectral index for i , q , and u. the first natural improvement is to fix the q and u spectral indices to be common in each pixel , @xmath164 .",
    "physically this is reasonable ; the polarized signal comes from the same region of the galaxy for both q and u - type , and can be expected to have the same frequency dependence , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "we repeat tests f and g with this condition ( tests f2 and g2 ) , and show the recovered index map in fig .",
    "[ fig : betas_maps ] , with the likelihoods for @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : additional_data ] .",
    "the index map now has a higher signal - to - noise ratio , and the bias on @xmath0 reduced from more than @xmath149 to @xmath121 ( for a prior of @xmath165 ) .",
    "fixing the temperature and polarization indices to be common is less physically motivated so we do not consider this here ; depolarization effects could lead to different regions of the galaxy contributing to the integrated polarization signal .     for the baseline simulation with mean synchrotron index input @xmath166 , and gaussian priors @xmath144 or @xmath145 ( test f and g ) .",
    "the prior - dependent biases are reduced when the signal - to - noise is increased by assigning q and u common indices ( top , f2 ) , or adding low - frequency data from _ wmap _ or c - bass ( bottom , f3 ) .",

    "the prior - dependent biases are reduced when the signal - to - noise is increased by assigning q and u common indices ( top , f2 ) , or adding low - frequency data from _ wmap _ or c - bass ( bottom , f3 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the signal - to - noise ratio can also be improved by adding ancillary data that better traces the foregrounds .",
    "since the synchrotron signal dominates at lower frequencies , additional data at the low frequency range will increase the synchrotron signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we repeat test f again ( f3 ) , adding simulated data from the _ wmap _ 23  ghz k - band channel , and projected _ c - bass _ data at 5 ghz , to the simulated _ planck _ data from 30 - 353 ghz .",
    "figure [ fig : betas_maps ] shows the significantly improved estimate of the synchrotron index in this case , which translates into a reduction in bias on @xmath0 from @xmath149 to @xmath121 for a prior of @xmath65 . with the low frequency data , the indices are better constrained by the data .    a final obvious way to reduce the model freedom",
    "is to allow less spatial variation in the indices . in the limit of no spatial variation , this reduces to template cleaning @xcite , with one spectral index over the whole sky .",
    "however , a concern with these methods is that they may not capture realistic spatial variation .",
    "the optimal balance is likely in between , requiring fewer than @xmath363000 parameters to describe the spatially varying frequency dependence .",
    "such an approach has been considered for polarization analysis in e.g. , @xcite , where 48 synchrotron spectral index parameters were used for _ wmap _ component separation . in making this choice with real data",
    ", it will be important to test that results do not depend on the prior placed on frequency dependence .",
    "if so , the number of parameters should be reduced , or external data included where available .",
    "in section [ sec : wrong_model ] we found that over - simplifying the frequency dependence of the two components can also lead to a bias in recovered parameters .",
    "modeling the synchrotron as a power law everywhere on the sky , when it actually has a spectral curvature of @xmath167 , results in a @xmath168 bias high in @xmath0 .",
    "as in sec [ subsec : priors ] , this can be understood as an overestimation of synchrotron at the 100  ghz range by up to @xmath169k in antenna temperature , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_depend ] .",
    "since some steepening is expected from synchrotron cooling , a strategy to prevent this bias would be to additionally marginalize over a curvature parameter .",
    "if the estimated cmb power does not change significantly with its inclusion , and the curvature is consistent with zero , this would justify neglecting the additional complexity .",
    "while we have examined only the case for synchrotron having a negative spectral curvature , there is some evidence to suggest that the spectral curvature could be positive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is not unexpected since multiple spectral components can give a flattening of the effective synchrotron index . with real data , a positive curvature as large as @xmath123",
    "could be realistically considered .    at the high frequency end ,",
    "thermal dust emission is typically modelled as a modified black - body , characterized by an emissivity and temperature , with @xmath170 , and similarly for q and u. this corresponds to our ` one - component ' dust model .",
    "a more complicated model has a sum of two or more components with different temperatures . in sec [ sec : wrong_model ] we found that modelling a two - component dust model as a one - component dust model has only a small effect on the estimated cmb signal .",
    "this reflects that the sum of two modified black - bodies , one sub - dominant , scales with frequency similarly to a single black - body .",
    "a larger bias was found for a modified black - body modelled as a power law . in this case",
    "we find a 1@xmath88 shift in recovered @xmath0 , with the power - law model typically over - subtracting dust .",
    "the effect is similar to neglecting synchrotron curvature . while it is unlikely in practice that the dust would be modelled as a pure power - law , it is possible that one could make the wrong choice for the dust temperature . in these tests",
    "we fixed the temperature to the input value that was common over the whole sky , and varied just the emissivity in each pixel .",
    "to check for a possible bias with real data , one would ideally additionally fit for the dust temperature .",
    "another approach to determine the dust temperature would be to use the temperature data , including the higher - frequency unpolarized channels of _ planck _ ( 545 and 857  ghz ) , and iras / dirbe data up to @xmath171  ghz .",
    "the dust temperature could then be assumed to be common for the polarization data .",
    "we find that neglecting sub - dominant polarized free - free and spinning dust components has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "this can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_depend_ff_sd ] .",
    "the simulations include a 1% polarized signal , with the rms signal of each component , averaged outside the galactic mask , shown to be sub - dominant to an @xmath5 signal in the range @xmath172  ghz .",
    "the true polarization of these components is unknown , but is not expected to exceed this level .",
    "observations of the ophiuchi and perseus cloud limit the polarization of spinning dust to be less than 2% at 20 - 30  ghz @xcite , and wmap observations limit it to less than 1% over the whole sky .",
    "these levels are consistent with the spinning dust model by @xcite . for this mask ,",
    "spinning dust polarization has a slightly larger effect on @xmath0 than free - free polarization .",
    "the spinning dust component is currently the most uncertain , so will be worth re - visiting with real data .",
    "there are fewer observational constraints on the polarization of free - free emission .",
    "however , it should be intrinsically unpolarized because the scattering directions are random .",
    "secondary polarization can be generated at the edges of bright free - free features from thomson scattering @xcite , but leading to less than @xmath173% polarization at high galactic latitudes .",

    "extracting robust estimates for the tensor - to - scalar ratio rely on modelling and subtracting polarized foregrounds . since the polarized cmb signal is many times smaller than the foreground emission , the need to get this right is particularly acute .",
    "many methods have been considered and implemented for foreground removal , but given the lack of data , the simulations are usually simple in form .    in this paper",
    "we have begun to quantify the impact on estimates of @xmath0 of incorrect foregound modelling .",
    "the tests were aimed at a detection of a signal with @xmath5 , but the goal of future missions is to reach @xmath175 or lower , so we also consider an @xmath3 model .",
    "we conclude that neglecting a non - power - law frequency dependence of foregrounds may have a non - negligible effect on @xmath0 ; whereas neglecting a small free - free or spinning dust component is likely not to .",
    "we found that over - parameterizing the spectral indices had significant consequences ; in the limit of a low signal - to - noise ratio the result can be highly prior - dependent .",
    "we discussed methods of mitigating possible bias , through model comparison as more complexity is added to the foreground model , and through increasing the signal - to - noise ratio on spectral parameters by reducing their number and using ancillary data .",
    "we did not cover all scenarios of mismatch , but the approach of checking the goodness - of - fit through model comparison , and checking for a dependence of results on priors should be generally applicable .",
    "we did not explore the effects of different masks although this will be important to investigate with data ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
