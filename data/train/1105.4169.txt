    "1 are used for calculating @xmath12 when we use only @xmath1 , while additional diagrams as illustrated by fig . 2",

    "the @xmath2 interaction depends explicitly on the fermi momentum @xmath55 which is well defined for nuclear matter . but",

    "as shown by the lower curve of the figure , @xmath103 and @xmath104 both vary monotonically with the density when only @xmath1 is employed . with increasing density , @xmath103 becomes incresingly more negative and @xmath104 increasingly larger , exhibiting no saturation ( up to 3.0 @xmath17 ) .",
    "the trend is quite different for the upper curve where the three - nucleon force is included .",
    "here @xmath104 still monotonically increases with density , but @xmath103 arises after saturation , approaching zero at some higher density .",
    "it is of interest that @xmath2 has a large effect in raising the chemical potential of nucleons in high density nuclear matter ; this raise of the chemical potential may play an important role in enabling such nucleons decaying into other baryons such as hyperons .    as indicated by fig .",
    "4 , our ring - diagram calculations with the inclusion of the nnn force @xmath2 have described well the nuclear matter saturation properties . it would be useful and of interest to check if this approach is also satisfactory for describing closed - shell nuclei whose nucleons are mainly embedded in a similar nuclear medium of densities near @xmath19 , the nuclear matter satturation density . to study this possiblity ,",

    "7 the matrix elements of the @xmath5-shell effective interactions calculated from @xmath1 with and without @xmath2 , denoted respectively as nn+nnn and nn , are compared .",
    "as seen , the two sets of matrix elements are rather similar to each other , with the magnitudes of those including @xmath2 being slightly larger .",
    "the low - lying spectrum of @xmath7 and @xmath8 calculated with the above interactions are presented in figs . 8 and 9 .",
    "the main effect of the ` nnn ' force is a small downward shift for the ground states of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while leaving the other states largely unchanged .",
    "this trend is consistent with what we have observed for nuclear matter calculations ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , namely the effect of @xmath2 is slightly attractive at low densities . with the inclusion of thre nnn force ,",
    "the ground - state energy of @xmath8 is in good agreement with experiment while that for @xmath7 is slightly overbound .",
    "the agreements of the other states with experiments for @xmath7 are better than @xmath8 .    using the method outlined in section ii and @xcite",
    ", we have also calculated the effective interaction for a @xmath6 two - shell space using @xmath1 with and without the inclusion of @xmath2 . in figs . 8 and 9 ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained with the former effective interaction are also presented ( two - shell , nn+nnn ) .",
    "as seen , the two - shell and one - shell results are rather similar to each other . to further study the effects of the three - nucleon force @xmath2 , we have extended the calculations of figs . 8 and 9 to nuclei @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with results presented in figs .",
    "10 and 11 . here ,",
    "similar to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the ground - state energies of @xmath9 and @xmath10 obtained with @xmath1 only are both too high compared with experiments ( see the nn columns ) .",
    "as shown by the nn+nnn columns , the inclusion of @xmath2 slightly lowers these energies . the one - shell and",
    "two - shell results are rather close to each other for @xmath9 .",
    "but they are slightly different for @xmath10 , with the nn+nnn ground - state energy noticebly lower than the nn one .    as shown in figs .",
    "8 - 11 , although there are qualitative agreements between the calculated and experimental spectra of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , there are significant disagreements between them .",
    "for example , the orderings of the calculated low - lying states of @xmath9 are in fair agreement with the experimental ones , but their relative spacings are not .",
    "as shown by the figures , the effects from @xmath2 are generally small and attractive , mainly slightly lowering their ground - state energies while having nearly no influence on the relative spacings of the calculated spectrum",
    ". it should be useful to further study how to reduce the above disagreements .",
    "we have employed a low - order approximation for the @xmath57-box , including only 1st- and 2nd - order diagrams .",
    "the inclusion of higher - order diagrams may alter our results . as carried out by by holt et al .",
    "@xcite , certain classes of planar diagrams of the @xmath57-box can be summed up to all orders using the kirson - babu - brown induced interaction method .",
    "we plan to extend our present calculations by including these planar diagrams , and study their effects to the shell - model description of these nuclei . ?",
    "we have carried out shell - model calculations for nuclei @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 using effective interactions derived from the chiral two- and three - nucleon potentials .",
    "we start from the @xmath15 two - nucleon potential @xmath1 together with an in - medium three - nucleon potential @xmath145 which is a density - dependent effective interaction derived from the lowest - order chiral three - nucleon force @xmath3 by holt , kaiser and weise @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 low - momentum interactions are then derived from these potentials , and are used in a folded - diagram expansion for calculating the @xmath12 interactions for both the degenerate @xmath5 and non - degenerate @xmath6 model soaces . the well - known lee - suzuki iteration method @xcite is used for the derivation of the @xmath5 effective interactions , while the recently developed iteration method of okamoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is employed for the @xmath6 ones .",
    "we have studied the effects of @xmath2 , which is an effective two - body interaction depending on the medium density @xmath16 , at various densities near and below the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath19 .",
    "we first apply the @xmath2 interaction to nuclear matter calculations for which the medium density is uniform and well defined .",
    "a ring - diagram method for nuclear matter has been employed .",
    "the low - energy constants @xmath106 and @xmath107 , of respectively the one - pion and contact terms of the leading - order chiral three - nucleon potential @xmath3 , are not well known .",
    "we have chosen these constants by requiring that their use in our nuclear matter calculations with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is derived from @xmath3 , satisfactorily reproduces the saturation properties of nuclear matter . as indicated in fig .",
    "4 , the inclusion of @xmath2 has largely improved our nuclear matter results comparing with those given by @xmath1 alone , and the resulting nuclear matter saturation propertiesa are in good agreement with the empirical values .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath5 and @xmath6 effective interactions with the inclusion of the above @xmath2 , and apply them to nuclei @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "an ambiguity here is the determination of the local density @xmath123 felt by the valence nucleons of these nuclei .",
    "this density should be small compared with the saturation density @xmath19 of nuclear matter , but it is difficult to determine its value precisely .",
    "we have estimated this value based on the density profile of @xmath11 given by a simple @xmath125 shell - model wave function .",
    "this is an approximation which should be further investigated and improved upon . in our calculations for these nuclei , we have adopted the estimation of @xmath146=0.15 . as indicated by figs .",
    "8 - 11 , the main effect of @xmath2 is to lower the ground - state energies of these nuclei slightly , making them in better agreements with experiments than the energies given by @xmath1 alone .",
    "the effects of @xmath2 to these nuclei are general small , mainly because their valence nucleons are in a low - density medium .    the above @xmath2",
    "has also been applied to a shell - model calculation of closed - shell nucleus @xmath11 .",
    "the nucleons in closed - shell nuclei are embedded in nuclear medium of much larger density than that for the valence nucleons mentioned above . for them",
    "the effect of @xmath2 is expected be more important .",
    "indeed this is confirmed by our calculations .",
    "as illustrated in table i , the inclusion of this interaction has been essential for satisfactorily reproducing the empirical binding energy of @xmath11",
    ". it should be useful and of interest to further study this in - medium three - nucleon potential by applying it to closed - shell nuclei and those with a few valence holes .",
