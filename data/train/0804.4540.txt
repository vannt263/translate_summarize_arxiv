    "high - precision measurement is an essential component of any advanced technology , be it classical or quantum . in the case of the emerging quantum technologies , however ,",
    "constraints on our ability to make precise measurements are imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "it is often the case that the measurement objective is simply to estimate a single parameter of the hamiltonian of a system  @xcite .",
    "for example , in atomic clocks the objective is to estimate the resonant frequency of a given electronic transition  @xcite . in the case of an optical interferometer ,",
    "the objective is to estimate an optical phase shift produced by some mechanism of interest , which changes the relative path length .",
    "as the parameter varies , the dynamics of the system changes , and precise determination of the parameter requires that the change in the dynamics of the system be resolvable with sufficient sensitivity to the parameter .",
    "the precision with which the parameter can be determined depends on the initial state of the system , the nature of the hamiltonian describing the system s evolution , and the measurements to be performed on the system .",
    "most work on parameter estimations assumes that system quanta are coupled independently to the parameter , meaning that the coupling is quadratic in the field variables , which leads to equations of motion that are linear in the field variables . for such linear couplings , the optimal precision in a parameter estimate scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the number of system quanta used in the measurement , a scaling known as the heisenberg limit  @xcite . achieving the heisenberg limit with a linear coupling requires using an entangled initial state  @xcite . if one is restricted to using product states , then a linear coupling can only achieve a @xmath3 scaling , which is called the shot - noise limit or the standard quantum limit .",
    "it was recently shown that quantum parameter estimation with scaling better than @xmath2 could be attained by using a coupling to the parameter that is _ nonlinear _ in field variables  @xcite ; such super - heisenberg scalings can be obtained even with an initial product state  @xcite .",
    "the use of product states , as opposed to entangled states , circumvents the difficulty of creating the entangled states and also makes the scheme considerably more robust against the deleterious effects of decoherence . in a related development ,",
    "a measurement of a phase shift of an optical field  @xcite , using an adaptive measurement scheme that requires no entanglement , has achieved a heisenberg - limited sensitivity in terms of number of interactions of photons with the phase shifter , rather than just the number of photons .",
    "flexural nanomechanical resonators have an intrinsic _ duffing nonlinearity _ due to extension on bending  @xcite ; technology is progressing towards the point where such resonators can be cooled to near their quantum ground state  @xcite .",
    "thus nanoresonators might provide a system in which parameter estimation beyond the @xmath2 heisenberg limit could be demonstrated , in this case measurement of the nonlinear coefficient for the duffing nonlinearity .",
    "other candidates for the first experimental demonstration of super - heisenberg scalings in parameter estimation include the measurement of phase in a nonlinear optics setting  @xcite , the measurement of a magnetic field in atomic magnetometry @xcite , and the measurement of atomic scattering strength in coupled bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .     or the @xmath4 quadrature , of one or both output modes ( denoted `` @xmath5 '' and `` @xmath6 '' ) .",
    "though not shown in the circuit , we have also considered the effect of dissipation accompanying the nonlinear evolution . ]    quite apart from any fundamental considerations , the ability to make high - precision measurements of the duffing nonlinearity of a nanomechanical resonator might be of considerable practical interest .",
    "the duffing nonlinearity of a nanomechanical resonator is an expression of the applied strain  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) have already been used to make highly sensitive mechanical strain sensors and accelerometers , with applications to engineering and biomedical systems  @xcite .",
    "high - precision measurements of the duffing nonlinearity would also have implications for ultra - sensitive nanomechanical mass and force detection  @xcite .",
    "we consider two parallel , flexural nanomechanical resonators , each with an intrinsic duffing nonlinearity and with a switchable , electrostatically - actuated beamsplitter - like coupling between them .",
    "the measurement proceeds as follows : one nanoresonator is excited into a large - amplitude coherent state , the beamsplitter interaction is pulsed on so that the coherent - state excitation is split equally between the two resonators , the nanoresonators evolve independently under the nonlinearities ( and standard linear dissipation ) , the beamsplitter interaction is pulsed in the same way again , and a homodyne measurement of the nanoresonator quadratures is performed .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ fig0 ] , this scheme effectively realizes a nonlinear interferometer  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the precision with which such a scheme can estimate the nonlinear coefficient of one nanoresonator and demonstrated that the precision scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean phonon number of the initial coherent state .",
    "each nanoresonator can be regarded as a thin bar of length @xmath7 and lateral width @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the fundamental mode of vibration of each nanoresonator in the lateral direction .",
    "each fundamental mode is described by a position - momentum pair , @xmath9-@xmath10 , where @xmath11 labels the resonators . with a time - dependent capacitive coupling dependent on the displacements from the equilibrium positions , @xmath12 , and duffing nonlinearities characterized by coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath11 ,",
    "the system can be described classically by a hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 specifies the coupling voltage pulses .    in current experiments ,",
    "the nonlinear coefficient @xmath16 of a nanoresonator is estimated  @xcite by measuring the critical amplitude @xmath17 at which the forced oscillations become bistable  @xcite and the quality factor @xmath18 of the oscillator and then using the relation @xmath19 .",
    "achievable values of these parameters are @xmath20 nm and @xmath21 , giving a nonlinear coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "we use this value of @xmath16 as a typical value in the following .",
    "we assume that the nanoresonators are capacitively coupled to nearby bias conducting surfaces in such a way that for small displacements , the capacitance can be expanded as @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the capacitance when the oscillators are at their equilibrium positions .",
    "the capacitive coupling must be balanced so that there is no net force on the resonators when the coupling is switched on ( i.e. , no linear terms in the expansion ) .",
    "this leaves the quadratic terms as the dominant effect of the coupling . in the quadratic terms , @xmath25 nm is a characteristic lateral separation between the resonators and the other conducting surfaces and @xmath26 is a factor of order unity .",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath26 depend on the specific design of the capacitive coupling .",
    "provided @xmath28 we can neglect the renormalization of the resonator frequencies during the pulsing of the capacitive coupling , retaining only the coupling between the resonators . with these assumptions ,",
    "the capacitive term in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hcl ] ) can be replaced by @xmath29 , which gives rise to the desired beamsplitter coupling .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa ] ) , characterizes the strength of the beamsplitter coupling .",
    "now we quantize by introducing the operators @xmath31 satisfying the usual commutation relations , and similarly for nanoresonator @xmath32 . transforming to an interaction picture and using the rotating - wave approximation",
    ", we find @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the half - width of the ground - state wave function .",
    "the use of the rotating - wave approximation requires that the time scale @xmath36 over which the coupling is varied in @xmath15 be significantly longer than the periods of the nanomechanical resonators . since @xmath37 ,",
    "this is the requirement , already introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa ] ) , that @xmath38 .    at low temperatures ,",
    "nanoresonator damping is thought to be mostly due to coupling to a bath of two - level systems , but this mechanism is not fully understood .",
    "therefore we do not try to model this mechanism , but rather treat dissipation using a quantum optics master equation ( with a zero - temperature bath ) , with the expectation that this generic model of damping provides a reasonable account of the effect of dissipation on parameter estimation .",
    "then the evolution of the density matrix describing the state of the two nanoresonators is given by @xmath39 + \\frac{\\gamma_a}{2 } ( 2a\\rho a^\\dagger - a^\\dagger a \\rho - \\rho a^\\dagger a ) + \\frac{\\gamma_b}{2 } ( 2b\\rho b^\\dagger - b^\\dagger b \\rho - \\rho b^\\dagger b)\\;. \\label{me}\\ ] ]    experimentally reasonable values for the system properties are @xmath40 , @xmath41 nm , @xmath42 kg , @xmath43rad / s , @xmath44 nm , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath45af , and @xmath46v . these correspond to @xmath47fm , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( we use @xmath50 as a typical value in the following ) , and @xmath51 . the quantity @xmath52 is roughly the number of phonons required to make the quartic nonlinearity as large as the harmonic potential ; it corresponds to an oscillation amplitude @xmath53 nm .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : precision ] we analyze estimation of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath54 of oscillator  @xmath8 , assuming that oscillator  @xmath32 has no nonlinearity ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "other operating conditions are possible and yield similar results , but the figures in the remainder of the paper refer to the @xmath55 case .",
    "we consider a fiducial evolution time @xmath56s , so that @xmath57 , meaning that the effects of dissipation are large , but not overwhelming , and we consider a fiducial initial phonon number @xmath58 , so that the nonlinear phase shift @xmath59 is about @xmath60rad .",
    "we investigate values within about an order of magnitude of these fiducial values .",
    "notice that a phonon number @xmath58 corresponds to an oscillation amplitude @xmath61 nm .",
    "this amplitude is close to the value we assumed for @xmath17 , not by accident , but because the two oscillation amplitudes quantify , one for free oscillations and one for forced oscillations , the same measure of the relative strengths of the nonlinearity and the damping .",
    "our assumptions about the switchable beamsplitter coupling require that @xmath38 , so that we can make the rotating - wave approximation , and that @xmath62 , so that we can regard the beamsplitter pulses as essentially instantaneous .",
    "both of these inequalities are well satisfied by the above values .",
    "now suppose that nanoresonator @xmath8 is excited into a coherent state with amplitude @xmath63 , assumed real . the ( product ) state of the two nanoresonators is then given , in the @xmath18 representation  @xcite , by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if we pulse on the beamsplitter interaction for a time @xmath66 , the state of the system is a product of two equal - amplitude coherent states ; in other words , we have a `` balanced '' beamsplitter .",
    "the pulse time @xmath36 is sufficiently short that the effect of nonlinearities and dissipation are negligible .",

    "the scaling behavior is maintained in the presence of feasible levels of dissipation , although there is a marked deterioration in sensitivity .    in practice ,",
    "the initial state of the excited nanoresonator would be better described by a displaced thermal state .",
    "provided that the thermal width of this state is small compared with the amplitude of the displacement , a condition that would be well satisfied by an excitation at the level we are considering , the primary effect of an initial thermal distribution would be simply to increase the output quadrature variances , leading to a reduction in sensitivity , but not to change in the scaling behavior . in the strong damping regime ,",

    "a more severe difficulty lies in performing quantum - limited homodyne detection of the output quadratures , though it is conceivable that such measurements could be performed using coupled microwave cavities  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the precision with which the nonlinearity of a nanomechanical resonator can be estimated , using a nanomechanical analogue of a nonlinear interferometer . for an input coherent state ,",

    "this scaling behavior is maintained in the presence of dissipation , which we modeled using a quantum optics master equation , and it is expected that this scheme is reasonably robust to increases in temperature .",
    "quantum - limited homodyne detection of the nanoresonator quadratures is , however , a very challenging experimental task .",
    "an alternative scheme would use a single nonlinear nanomechanical resonator coupled to the field in a superconducting microwave cavity , which would act as the second `` arm '' of an interferometer .",
    "the nonlinearity would then only be in the mechanical arm of the interferometer .",
    "the initial state would be excited by driving the cavity , and read - out would be performed by quantum - limited homodyne detection of the cavity output . a beamsplitter - like interaction between the cavity and nanoresonator",
    "could be realized by driving the cavity on its red sideband  @xcite .",
    "this beamsplitter coupling would be continuous , so the analytical results obtained here are not directly applicable . investigating the achievable sensitivity of this cavity - nanoresonator scheme is the subject of ongoing work .",

    "<S> we consider a nanomechanical analogue of a nonlinear interferometer , consisting of two parallel , flexural nanomechanical resonators , each with an intrinsic duffing nonlinearity and with a switchable beamsplitter - like coupling between them . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the precision with which the strength of the nonlinearity can be estimated and show that it scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean phonon number of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> this result holds even in the presence of dissipation , but assumes the ability to make measurements of the quadrature components of the nanoresonators . </S>"
