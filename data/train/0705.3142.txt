    "hence if @xmath152 belongs to a stratum that does not consist entirely of hyperelliptic flat surfaces , then we can choose @xmath152 such that @xmath275 is not in a hyperelliptic connected component .",
    "the hypothesis on the genus , the theorem of kontsevich - zorich and the theorem of lanneau imply that this arguments works except when @xmath152 belongs to @xmath48 , @xmath295 , @xmath65 , or @xmath67 .",
    "we remark that if @xmath296 , then @xmath260 must have nontrivial linear holonomy and no interior singularities . according to the list of configurations for hyperelliptic connected components given in section @xmath95",
    ", this can not happen .",
    "we exhibit in figure [ b_case ] three explicit surfaces with boundary that corresponds to the three cases left .",
    "we represent these three surfaces as having a one - cylinder decomposition and by describing the identifications on the boundary of that cylinder .",
    "the length parameters can be chosen freely under the obvious condition that the sum of the lengths corresponding to the top of the cylinder must be equal to the sum of the lengths corresponding to the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "bold lines represents the boundary of the flat surface .",
    "now we remark that a nontrivial isometric involution must preserve the interior of the cylinder , and must exchange the boundary components .",
    "this induces some supplementary relations on the length parameters .",
    "therefore , we can choose them such that there is no nontrivial isometric involution .",
    "[ lem_c ] let @xmath6 be a flat surface of genus @xmath297 with nontrivial linear holonomy that belongs to a hyperelliptic connected component and let @xmath298 be a maximal collection of omologous saddle connections on @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath97 is connected , then there exists @xmath280 that has the same configuration as @xmath281 , with @xmath275 in the complementary component of the same stratum .",
    "since @xmath99 is connected , the graph @xmath87 contains a single vertex , and it has valence four . according to theorem [ confighyp ] , two different cases appear :    \\a ) the surface @xmath299 has one boundary component . in this case",
    "we start from a surface in @xmath300 and perform a local surgery in a neighborhood of the singularity , as described in figure [ local4 ] ( see also @xcite , section @xmath4 ) .",
    "we get a surface and a pair of small saddle connections of length @xmath301 that have the same configuration as @xmath71 .",
    "the stratum @xmath300 admits non - hyperelliptic components and the same argument as in the previous lemmas works : if we start from a generic surface in a non - hyperelliptic component , then the resulting surface after surgery does not have any nontrivial involution .",
    "\\b ) the surface @xmath299 has two boundary components , each of them consists of a pair of saddle connections with boundary singularities of order @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "we construct explicit surfaces with the same configuration as @xmath71 , but that have no nontrivial involution .",
    "let @xmath304 and we start from a surface @xmath260 of genus @xmath305 in @xmath306 , that have a one - cylinder decomposition and such as identification on the boundary of that cylinder is given by the permutation @xmath307 when @xmath305 is even , and otherwise by the permutation @xmath308    we assume that @xmath188 and @xmath189 are odd and we perform a surgery on @xmath260 to get a surface @xmath129 with boundary as pictured on figure [ c_case ] .",
    "the surface @xmath129 admits two boundary components that consist of two saddle connections each and which are represented by the bold segments .",
    "each symbol , , ,   represents a different boundary singularity .",
    "it is easy to check that the boundary angles corresponding to   and   are both @xmath219 and that the angles corresponding to   and   are @xmath220 .",
    "hence after suitable identifications of the boundary of @xmath129 , we get a surface @xmath275 and a pair of omologous saddle connections @xmath77 that have the same configuration as @xmath281 .",
    "however , @xmath275 does not admit any nontrivial involution if the length parameters are chosen generically .",
    "note that this construction does not work when @xmath309 , but according to section @xmath95 , and since @xmath188 and @xmath189 are odd , we have @xmath310 , which is greater than or equal to @xmath95 by assumption .    the case @xmath188 and @xmath189 even is analogous and left to the reader ( note that in this case , @xmath311 , and the construction works also for @xmath309 ) .",
    "here we improve lemma [ genre ] and give the relation between the genus of a surface and the genera of the connected components of @xmath97 , where @xmath71 is a collection of omologous saddle connections .    we first remark that this relation depends not only on the graph of connected components , but also on the permutation on each of its vertices ( _ i.e. _ on the ribbon graph ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider a pair of omologous saddle connections that decompose the surface into two connected components @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "then either both @xmath129 and @xmath130 have only one boundary component , or at least one of them has two boundary components .",
    "in the first case , @xmath6 is the connected sum of @xmath221 and @xmath222 , so @xmath312 , while in the second case , one has @xmath313 .",
    "let @xmath281 be a flat surface with a collection of omologous saddle connections .",
    "pure _ ribbon graph associated to @xmath281 is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained from the ribbon graph by forgetting the graph @xmath87 , as in figure [ purerg ] .",
    "here we do not assume that the collection @xmath71 is necessary maximal .",
    "when @xmath87 has a single vertex , then we prove the proposition using direct computation and the description of the boundary components corresponding to each possible ribbon graph .",
    "we refer to @xcite for this description",
    ". then our goal is to reduce ourselves to that case by removing successively from the collection @xmath322 some @xmath91 whose corresponding edges joins a vertex to a distinct one .",
    "we define a new graph @xmath323 , which is a deformation retract of the pure ribbon graph : the vertices of @xmath323 are the boundary components of each @xmath100 , while the edges correspond to the saddle connections in @xmath71 ( see figure [ exemple_genre_exact ] ) . for each vertex",
    ", there is a cyclic order on the set of edges adjacent to the vertex consistent with the orientation of the plane . if the initial pure ribbon graph does not embed into the plane , then it is also the case for @xmath323 . by construction ,",
    "the euler characteristic of @xmath323 is the same as the pure ribbon graph associated to @xmath281 , and is easier to compute .",
    "let @xmath87 contains at least two vertices .",
    "choose a saddle connection representing an edge joining two distinct vertices of @xmath87 , and up to renumeration , we can assume that this saddle connection is @xmath72 .",
    "let us study the resulting configuration of @xmath324 .",
    "the saddle connection @xmath72 is on the boundary of two surfaces @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "then the connected components of @xmath327 are the same as the connected component of @xmath99 except that the surfaces @xmath325 and @xmath326 are now glued along @xmath72 , and hence define a single surface @xmath328 .",
    "the genus of @xmath328 ( after gluing disks on its boundary ) is @xmath329 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath72 was in a boundary component of @xmath129 ( resp .",
    "@xmath130 ) defined by the ordered collection @xmath331 ( resp .",
    "@xmath332 ) .",
    "then the cyclic order in the corresponding boundary component of @xmath328 is defined by @xmath333 .",
    "therefore @xmath330 is obtained from @xmath323 by shrinking the edge corresponding to @xmath72 and removing an isolated vertex that might appear ( see figure [ exemple_genre_exact ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the difference @xmath334 between the euler characteristic of @xmath323 and its number of connected component is constant under this procedure .",
    "one can also remark that if @xmath323 is connected and does not embed into the plane ( case @xmath24 of the proposition ) , then this is also true for @xmath330 .",
    "forgetting successively these @xmath91 will lead to the case when @xmath87 has a single vertex . at each steps of the removing procedure ,",
    "the numbers @xmath314 and @xmath335 do not change , and the sum of the genera associated to the vertices does not change either .",
