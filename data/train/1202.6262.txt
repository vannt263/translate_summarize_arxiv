    "the theory of thermal transport dates back to the works of debye and peierls@xcite who studied the heat transfer within solids . in recent years",
    "the study of heat transfer in nano systems is very active due to the need in device applications .",
    "one approach is to look at the classical properties of heat transport using molecular dynamics@xcite .",
    "this technique gives good insight in the high - temperature regime but can not be applied to low temperatures .",
    "the low - temperature regime can be probed using nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) techniques , which are inherently quantum mechanical , but they suffer from the drawback of being suitable only to harmonic systems@xcite .",
    "anharmonic systems on the other hand provide a tool to control heat transfer in nano systems with potential technological applications , e.g. , a thermal diode@xcite and a thermal transistor@xcite .",
    "some systems are purely anharmonic like the spin boson model@xcite , a paradigm in condensed matter and quantum computation .",
    "thus , it is important to study the effect of anharmonic interactions in thermal transport from a fundamental point of view .",
    "untill now , most of the works dealing with anharmonic interactions concentrate on the classical properties like the derivation of fourier s law@xcite or its validity@xcite as a function of system size@xcite and dimension@xcite",
    ". although these results are essential to our understanding of thermal transport , they are only valid for mesoscopic systems at relatively high temperatures .    at low temperatures and",
    "small system sizes where quantum effects could play a crucial role wang has developed quantum molecular dynamics that can probe into the moderate temperature regime but can not be extended to very low temperatures@xcite .",
    "segal et  al . have developed a master equation approach that is valid for all temperatures but their technique employs the pauli master equation,@xcite which neglects possible coherent effects .",
    "techniques based on the green - kubo formula and the quantum master equation have also been developed@xcite , which should be valid only for large system sizes .",
    "velizhanin et  al .",
    "have combined the green s function technique with the master equation approach but face the problem of non - conservation of energy@xcite . mingo@xcite and",
    "wang et  al.@xcite have also developed techniques purely based on green s function that treat the anharmonicity perturbatively .    despite these various advances",
    ", the master equation approach seems the most suited tool to study thermal transport in anharmonic systems for arbitrary strength of anharmonicity under weak coupling to the baths . in this approach",
    ", the heat current is calculated using the reduced density matrix along with an appropriate heat current operator .",
    "the reduced density matrix is typically calculated using a variety of master equations@xcite out of which the redfield quantum master equation ( rqme ) is the most general equation with only the weak coupling approximation .",
    "the pauli and the lindblad master equations can be derived from it by introducing further approximations@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will derive an explicit form of the heat current operator using standard perturbative techniques ( for weak coupling ) that along with the zero - order reduced density matrix from the redfield equation will allow us to calculate heat currents for anharmonic systems .",
    "one of the advantages of our formalism is that it can be used to study transients and it conserves energy in the steady state ( without the need to symmetrize the heat current ) . in this work",
    ", we will not address the problem of transients ; we will focus on the calculation of the steady - state heat current for mono and diatomic molecules either confined in a double - well potential or connected by an anharmonic spring and having a non - linear on - site potential .",
    "for molecules confined in a double - well potential we find that by varying the height of the barrier , we observe negative differential thermal conductance ( ndtc ) not only in the classical regime ( high @xmath0 ) but also in the quantum regime ( low @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , in the problem with non - linear on - site potential and the anharmonic spring , we find different behaviors of thermal conductance in all temperature ranges .",
    "specifically , at low temperatures , thermal conductance is drastically affected by the non - linear on - site potential whereas in the same temperature regime anharmonicity plays almost no role .",
