    "in the _ hamiltonian path completion problem _ ( for short , _ hp - completion _ ) we are given a graph @xmath0 ( directed or undirected ) and we are asked to identify a set of edges ( refereed to as an _ hp - completion set _ ) such that , when these edges are embedded on @xmath0 they turn it to a hamiltonian graph . the resulting hamiltonian graph @xmath2 is referred to as the _ hp - completed graph _ of @xmath0 .",
    "when we treat the hp - completion problem as an optimization problem , we are interested on an hp - completion set of minimum size .",
    "when the input graph @xmath0 is a planar embedded digraph , an hp - completion set for @xmath0 must be naturally extended to include an embedding of its edges on the plane , yielding to an embedded hp - completed digraph @xmath2 .",
    "in general , @xmath2 is not planar , and thus , it is natural to attempt to minimize the number of edge crossings of the embedding of the hp - completed digraph @xmath2 instead of the size of the hp - completion set .",
    "we refer to this problem as the _ hp - completion with crossing minimization problem _ ( for short , _ hpccm _ ) .",
    "the hpccm problem can be further refined by placing restrictions on the maximum number of permitted crossings per edge of @xmath0 .",
    "when the input digraph @xmath0 is acyclic , we can insist on hp - completion sets which leave the hp - completed digraph @xmath2 also acyclic .",
    "we refer to this version of the problem as the _ acyclic hp - completion problem_.    a _ k - page book _ is a structure consisting of a line , referred to as _ spine _ , and of @xmath3 half - planes , referred to as _ pages _ , that have the spine as their common boundary .",
    "book embedding _ of a graph @xmath0 is a drawing of @xmath0 on a book such that the vertices are aligned along the spine , each edge is entirely drawn on a single page , and edges do not cross each other . if we are interested only on two - dimensional structures we have to concentrate on 2-page book embeddings and to allow spine crossings .",
    "these embeddings are also referred to as 2-page _ topological _ book embeddings .    for acyclic digraphs ,",
    "an upward book embedding can be considered to be a book embedding in which the spine is vertical and all edges are drawn monotonically increasing in the upward direction . as a consequence , in an upward book embedding of an acyclic digraph the vertices appear along the spine in topological order .    the results on topological book embedding that appear in the literature focus on the number of spine crossings per edge required to book - embed a graph on a 2-page book .",
    "however , approaching the topological book embedding problem as an optimization problem , it make sense to also try to minimize the number of spine crossings .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the problem of _ acyclic hamiltonian path completion with crossing minimization _",
    "( for short , _ acyclic - hpccm _ ) for planar embedded acyclic digraphs .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that edge - crossing minimization is studied in conjunction with the acyclic hp - completion problem .",
    "then , we provide a characterization under which a triangulated @xmath1-digraph is hamiltonian . for an outerplanar",
    "triangulated @xmath1-digraph @xmath0 , we define the _ @xmath1-polygon decomposition of @xmath0 _ and , based on the decomposition s properties , we develop a linear - time algorithm that solves the acyclic - hpccm problem with at most one crossing per edge of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , for the class of @xmath1-planar digraphs , we establish an equivalence between the acyclic - hpccm problem and the problem of determining an upward 2-page topological book embeddig with a minimal number of spine crossings .",
    "based on this equivalence , we can infer for the class of outerplanar triangulated @xmath1-digraphs an upward topological 2-page book embedding with minimum number of spine crossings and at most one spine crossing per edge .",
    "again , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that an optimal algorithm with respect to spine crossing minimization is presented for upward topological book embeddings .      let @xmath4 be a graph .",
