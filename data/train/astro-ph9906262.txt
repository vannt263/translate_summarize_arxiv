    "many double - barred galaxies  those with a smaller , concentric bar inside the main bar  have been found in recent years ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "@xcite find secondary bars in at least 20% of their sample of barred s0sa field galaxies .",
    "wozniak et al .  ( 1995 , hereafter @xcite ) and @xcite noted three galaxies that appeared to have _ three _ concentric bar - like structures .",
    "bars - within - bars have been advocated as a way to bring gas into the nucleus of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied dissipative motion in a system with the inner bar rotating faster than the outer one , while maciejewski & sparke ( 1997 ) showed how these might be modeled as self - consistent dynamical systems , with particle orbits reproducing the shape of the potential . here , we present optical images from our survey with the 3.5 m wiyn telescope and archival optical and near - ir images from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) for two of @xcite s triple - bar candidates , ngc 3945 and ngc 4371 , and a third galaxy , ngc 2681 .",
    "images were analyzed using the iraf ellipse package , which fits ellipses to isophotes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we identified bars by visual inspection of the images and by looking for peaks in isophote ellipticity that were accompanied by stationary values of the position angle , as described by @xcite .",
    "we also created unsharp masks , to look for subtle , small - scale brightness variations and structures not otherwise readily apparent .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the main features we found .    *",
    "ngc 2681 , figure  1 : * this galaxy is close to face - on ; outer disk isophotes have ellipticity @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the three barlike structures can not be projection effects .",
    "the outermost bar is relatively large , though not outside the range for early - type galaxies found by @xcite .",
    "although this structure is relatively faint , the pa is nearly stationary at @xmath1 for @xmath2@xmath3 ( 1c ) . at these radii ,",
    "the isophotes have the squared - off ends ( 1a , d ) characteristic of bars in early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we feel reasonably confident that this _ is _ a bar .",
    "the nicmos image confirms the existence of a third bar  tentatively identified by @xcite and @xcite as the galaxy s secondary bar .    *",
    "ngc 3945 , figure  2 : * interpretation of structures in this galaxy depends strongly on what inclination is assumed .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath4 , and that the galaxy is triply barred . for two reasons , we feel that an inclination of @xmath5 is more likely , and that their secondary bar is probably an axisymmetric structure . the primary bar ( @xmath6 )",
    "is surrounded by outer and inner rings ( 2d , g ) ; both appear perpendicular to the bar .",
    "inner rings are almost always elongated _ parallel _ to the bar ( buta 1986 , 1995 )",
    ". if the inner ring is intrinsically circular , then @xmath7 ; @xmath8 for a typical axis ratio ( b / a = 0.78 , @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematics also imply a high inclination : @xcite measured stellar speeds of @xmath9 in the lens region , while the h@xmath10i profile has a half - width of 340 ( @xcite ) . if @xmath4 , then the circular velocity reaches an astonishing @xmath11 , higher even than in the fastest - rotating disk galaxy known , ugc 12591 ( @xcite , @xmath12 ) . for @xmath13",
    ", we would have @xmath14 .",
    "our fits ( 2c ) show _ seven _ ellipticity peaks  including the outer and inner rings  all but two of which are within position angles 155@xmath15 . at least some of the latter structures are probably near - axisymmetric , viewed at an inclination of @xmath16 . kormendy ( 1993 )",
    "has pointed out that the fast rotation and relatively low velocity dispersion in the `` bulge '' region ( @xmath17 ) of this galaxy suggest a disk rather than a bulge .",
    "the structure @xcite called a `` secondary bar '' ( the ellipticity peak at @xmath18 ) is thus probably intrinsically round and flat  an inner disk . assuming that it is vertically thin , the measured ellipticity of 0.36 deprojects to a circle if @xmath13 .",
    "unsharp masking ( 2e , f ) shows a nuclear ring or tight spiral with @xmath19 . at @xmath20@xmath21 , the wfpc2 images show a possible foreshortened secondary bar crossing the ring .",
    "the weak innermost ellipticity peak at @xmath22 , @xcite s `` tertiary bar '' , shares the common system alignment ; the galaxy center is probably mildly oblate rather than barred .",
    "the color map ( 2h ) shows complex dust structures within the nuclear ring .    *",
    "ngc 4371 , figure  3 : * @xcite identified a `` secondary bar '' at @xmath18 , aligned to within a few degrees of the outer disk ; they noted that it could be a projection effect , due to the galaxy s high inclination .",
    "our unsharp mask ( 3e ) shows that this feature is a smooth nuclear ring , rather than a bar , with no signs of dust or ongoing star formation .",
    "kormendy ( 1982 , 1993 ) noted disk - like dynamics in the bulge region ; the ring may be partially responsible .",
    "the stellar ring is marginally bluer than the surrounding bulge , or may be surrounded by a weak dust ring ; cf .  the red ring noted by @xcite .",
    "the very center of the galaxy shows twisted , spiral isophotes ( 3f ) , possibly due to a dusty nuclear disk .",
    "at hst resolution , ngc 2681 proves to have three distinct bars ; ngc 3945 has two .",
    "the relative orientation of the nested bars appears random , as expected if the components rotate independently , and in line with the findings of @xcite .",
    "both galaxies with multiple bars have liner nuclei , while ngc 4371 does not ; this is weak evidence in favor of shlosman et al.s ( 1989 ) thesis that inner bars can enhance nuclear fuelling ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "`` bars '' closely aligned with outer - disk isophotes must be treated with suspicion : they may be flat , axisymmetric structures in projection . combining unsharp masking with ellipse fits",
    ", we find a nuclear ring in ngc 4371 and a bright disk - plus - ring in the inner regions of ngc 3945 .",
    "neither ring shows signs of current star formation ; they may be part of a previously overlooked population of older , stellar nuclear rings in early - type galaxies . a dynamically `` hot '' stellar system like a bulge , where the velocity dispersion @xmath23 is of the same magnitude as the rotation speed @xmath24 ,",
    "does not form bars or rings ; these are characteristic of `` cool '' disks , where @xmath24 is at least a few times larger than @xmath23 .",
    "so the wealth of features revealed in these high - resolution images reinforces @xcite suggestion : the bright inner regions of many galaxies may be dominated by dynamically cool disks rather than dynamically hot bulges .",
