    "gravitational waves are a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity .",
    "many efforts have been done so far to detect them , but due to the intrinsic experimental difficulties involved in the process of detection and in the data analysis no definite result has been yet obtained .",
    "supernova core collapse , binary systems involving compact objects , like double black holes , double neutron stars or double white dwarfs are , amongst others , promising sources of gravitational waves  see schutz ( 1999 ) for a comprehensive review on the subject .",
    "moreover , with the advent of the current generation of terrestrial gravitational wave detectors , like ligo ( abramovici et al .",
    "1992 ) , virgo ( acernese et al . 2004 ) , geo600 ( willke et al .",
    "2004 ) , or tama ( takahashi et al .",
    "2004 ) , and of space - borne interferometers like lisa ( bender et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) , gravitational wave astronomy will probably be soon a tangible reality .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves are galactic binary systems containing at least one compact object .",
    "galactic binaries , such as neutron stars binaries , cataclysmic binaries or close white dwarf binaries , are guaranteed sources for lisa ( mironowsky 1965 ; evans , iben & smarr 1987 ) , provided that the sources are at sufficiently close distances .",
    "in fact , emission from galactic close white dwarf binary systems is expected to be the dominant contribution to the background noise in the low frequency region , which ranges from @xmath0 up to @xmath1  hz ( bender et al .",
    "1998 ) . additionally , from very simple considerations about the initial mass funtion , it is easy to see that galactic close white dwarf binaries must be quite common ( hils , bender & webbink 1990 ) and , consequently , if the amplitude of the gravitational waves is large enough we should be able to eventually detect them during the operation of lisa",
    ". moreover , the merging of two white dwarfs by emission of gravitational radiation will be the final destiny of a good fraction of this type of binary systems . since during the merging process",
    "a sizeable amount of gravitational waves is expected to be produced ( guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ) it is important to characterize which would be the gravitational wave emission of such process and to assess the feasibility of dectecting them .",
    "the process of formation of close white dwarf binaries involves two mass transfer episodes of the progenitor stars when each of the components of the binary system evolves off the main sequence . depending on when during the lives of the binary components the mass transfer episodes occur the components may have different core compositions . in particular , we may have he - he systems with a total mass @xmath2 , he - co for those systems with masss within the range @xmath3 , co - co for masses larger than @xmath4 and even he - one or co - one systems when one of the white dwarfs is a massive one . although the astrophysical scenarios in which a merger of two white dwarfs in a close binary system can occur and their relative frequencies have been relatively well studied",
    " see , for instance , yungelson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001a , 2001b ) , and references therein  the process of merging itself has received little attention until very recently .",
    "indeed , one of the probable reasons for this lack of theoretical models is the heavy computational demand involved in the simulation of an intrinsically three - dimensional phenomenon .",
    "however , in sharp contrast , the coalescence of two neutron stars has been extensively studied  see , for instance , rosswog et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , rosswog & davies ( 2002 ) , and rosswog & liebendrfer ( 2003 ) , and references therein , for some of the most recent works on this subject .    in a recent paper ( guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ) we thoroughly studied the merging of white dwarf binary systems for a wide range of masses and compositions . in doing this we used an up - to - date _ smoothed particle hydrodynamics _ code .",
    "this method was first proposed by lucy ( 1977 ) and , independently , by gingold & monaghan ( 1977 ) . the fact that the method is totally lagrangian and does not require a grid makes it specially suitable for studying an intrinsically three - dimensional problem like the coalescence of two white dwarfs . in the present paper we will not discuss the simulations presented there .",
    "the interested reader can find them in mpeg format at the following url : ftp://ftp.ieec.fcr.es/pub/astrofisica/sph .",
    "instead , in this paper we compute the gravitational wave signature expected from the merging of two white dwarfs as obtained from those sph calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the main ingredients of our sph code , whereas in  3 we summarize the physics of the emission of gravitational waves . in ",
    "4 we discuss the calibration and consistency checks we have done in order to assess the reliability of our results , whereas in  5 and  6 we present our results .",
    "finally , in  7 we summarize our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "we follow the coalescence of the binary system using a lagrangian particle numerical code and , more specifically , a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "our sph code has been described at length in guerrero et al .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness we provide here a short description of the main input physics and numerical techniques .",
    "our code follows closely the prescriptions of benz ( 1990 ) , where the basic numerical scheme for solving the hydrodynamic equations can be found .",
    "we use the standard polynomic kernel of monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) .",
    "the gravitational forces are evaluated using an octree ( barnes & hut 1986 ) . the artificial viscosity adopted in this work is that of balsara ( 1995 ) . regarding the integration method we use a predictor - corrector numerical scheme with variable time step ( serna , alimi & chieze 1996 ) , which turns out to be quite accurate .",
    "the adopted equation of state is the sum of three components .",
    "the ions are treated as an ideal gas but taking into account the coulombian corrections .",
    "we have also incorporated the pressure of photons . finally , the most important contribution is the pressure of degenerate electrons which is treated as the standard zero temperature expression plus the temperature corrections .",
    "the nuclear network adopted here ( benz , hill , & thielemann 1989 ) incorporates 14 nuclei : he , c , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , ti , cr , fe , ni and zn .",
    "the reactions considered are captures of @xmath5 particles , and the associated back reactions , the fusion of two c nuclei , and the reaction between c and o nuclei .",
    "all the rates are taken from rauscher & thielemann ( 2000 ) .",
    "the thermal evolution of the system is followed in two ways . on the one hand",
    "the variation of the internal energy is followed according to :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the smoothing kernel and the rest of the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the smooting length adopted in in this work is the linear average of the particles considered in the corresponding calculation ; that is @xmath8.on the other , we simultaneously compute the temperature variation according to :    @xmath9_j \\vec{v_{ij}}\\vec{\\nabla_i}w(r_{ij},h)\\ ] ]    if in the region under study the temperature is below @xmath10  k or the density is smaller than @xmath11  g/@xmath12 we use equation ( 2 ) otherwise we use equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we have found that in this way energy is better conserved .",
    "we compute the gravitational wave emission in the slow - motion , weak - field quadrupole approximation ( misner et al .",
    "the dimensionless wave strain , @xmath13 , in the transverse - traceless gauge is given by :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the retarded time , @xmath16 is the distance to the observer and @xmath17 is the reduced quadrupole moment of the mass distribution , which is given by :    @xmath18    the rest of the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "it is useful to express the time derivative of the quadrupole moment in the following way ( nakamura & oohara 1989 ) :    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    is the transverse - traceless projection operator onto the plane ortogonal to the outgoing wave direction , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the gravitational potential .",
    "now , one can express eq .",
    "( [ sol_retarded ] ) in the following way :    @xmath23    where the polarization tensor coordinate matrices are defined as :    @xmath24\\cr & & \\\\ \\textbf{e}_{\\times\\ , jk}&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(\\textbf{e}_{x})_j ( \\textbf{e}_{y})_k+(\\textbf{e}_{y})_j(\\textbf{e}_{x})_k],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the dimensionless amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the two independent modes of polarization in the transverse - traceless gauge , and the amplitudes are respectively given by    @xmath27    for @xmath28 , and    @xmath29    for @xmath30 .",
    "in our case we have a collection of @xmath31 individual sph particles .",
    "consequently , eq",
    ".  ( [ mom_derivative ] ) must be discretized and it is computed according to the following expression :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the mass of each sph particle , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , its position , velocity and acceleration .     and",
    "@xmath37 are measured in units of @xmath38 .",
    "the source is located at a distance of 10  kpc . ]",
    "we have done two tests , gravitational wave emission from a single , isolated star , and gravitational wave emission from a close white dwarf binary system in a circular orbit . for both cases there",
    "exist analytical solutions to which we can compare our numerical results . in the first case ,",
    "we have followed the time evolution of an isolated @xmath39 star using @xmath40 sph particles of the same mass . for the second test",
    "we have followed the evolution of a binary system made of two white dwarfs of the same mass ( @xmath39 ) in a circular orbit .",
    "each one of the white dwarfs was simulated using @xmath40 sph particles of the same mass .",
    "the first of our tests was designed to set the zero point of our calculations . since in sph simulations",
    "the particles are allowed to move freely under the action of their own gravitational potential and of the pressure forces , and since the mass of each particle is relatively large it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether or not a stable relaxed configuration radiates gravitational waves .",
    "figure  [ graf_zero ] shows the dimensionless strains for the case of an isolated white dwarf .",
    "we only show times larger than 60  s , for which the star is already relaxed to its final configuration . the relaxation procedure consisted in allowing the initial configuration ( which consisted in randomly distributing the sph particles according to the density profile of a zero temperature white dwarf of the same mass ) to evolve for a long enough time until the oscillations of the resulting configuration were completely negligible . in this way we check whether or not the numerical noise produces a negligible emission of gravitational waves . and",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "as it can be seen the emission of gravitational waves is negligible , as it should be , given that the relaxed configuration presents spherical symmetry  see eq .",
    "( [ mom_quadrupolar ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath37 are measured in units of @xmath41 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the theoretical solution whereas the dots correspond to our numerical solution .",
    "again , the source is assumed to be at a distance of 10  kpc . ]    with regard to the second test , it is worth recalling that the emission of gravitational waves from a binary system , can be obtained quite easily by assuming that both stars are point - like mass distributions . by doing so , from eqs .",
    "( [ sol_retarded ] ) and ( [ mom_quadrupolar ] ) one obtains    @xmath42    and    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the angular velocity of the stars , @xmath45 is the reduced mass , @xmath46 is the mass of the white dwarfs , and @xmath47 is the observation angle with respect to the orbital plane .    in our sph simulations we have chosen the binary system to have a separation of @xmath48 or , equivalently , @xmath49 .",
    "the two white dwarfs describe circular orbits and no mass is transferred between both components .",
    "moreover , the two white dwarfs preserve their initial spherical symmetry .",
    "hence , and according to eqs .",
    "( [ att1orbit ] ) and ( [ att2orbit ] ) , we should expect to obtain dimensionless strains which are sinusoidal functions with a period equal to half of the orbital period . as it can be seen from figure  [ graf_orbit ] , the numerical solution matches very well the theoretical one .",
    "in particular , both the amplitude and the frequency ( @xmath50  hz ) show an excellent agreement between theory and simulations . to further illustrate this overall excellent agreement , in figure  [ difs ] we show the residuals between the theoretical solution and the gravitational wave emission of the close white dwarf binary system in circular orbit . note that the scale in this case is one order of magnitude smaller than that of figure  [ graf_orbit ] .",
    "hence , we conclude that our sph simulations can accurately compute the emission of gravitational waves from coalescing white dwarfs .    .",
    "note that the dimensionless strains @xmath51 and @xmath37 are measured in units of @xmath52 , one order of magnitude smaller than the scale of fig .",

    "the number of sph particles for the simulations of the first section of the table is @xmath53 , whereas for the last simulation is @xmath54 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to check whether or not lisa would be able to detect a close white dwarf binary system we have proceeded as follows .",
    "we have already shown that the most prominent feature of the emitted signal is its sudden disappearance in a couple of orbital periods and that the gravitational wave emission during the coalescence phase does not increase noticeably .",
    "hence , the gravitational wave emission is dominated by the chirping phase .",
    "hence , we have assumed that the orbital separation of the two white dwarfs is exactly that of our binary system _ when mass transfer starts_. we have done so because , as explained before , we have added a small artificial acceleration term to the initial configuration in order to avoid an excessive computational demand at the very beginning of our simulations .",
    "this acceleration term is suppressed once the secondary begins to transfer mass onto the primary .",
    "note , however , that the mass transfer starts when the secondary fills its roche lobe and , consequently , this orbital separation is physically sound .",
    "we have further assumed that the integration time of lisa will be one year .",
    "we have checked that during this period the variation of the orbital separation is negligible ( see also figures  [ graf_hmerger1 ] and [ graf_hmerger2 ] ) .",
    "of course , should the integration time be smaller the signal - to - noise ratio derived below would smaller .",
    "hence , our results should be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath55 , is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the sensibility of lisa , @xmath58 is the integration period , and @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the dimensionless strain . it can be easily shown that for a monocromatic gravitational wave @xmath60 .",
    "the maximum distance , @xmath61 , at which lisa would be able to detect a close white dwarf binary system is then :     sph particles ) was used .",
    "the right panels show the same quantities when a high resolution was adopted ( @xmath62 sph particles ) .",
    "see text for further details . ]",
    "@xmath63    where @xmath64 is the frequency of gravitational wave , and @xmath46 is the chirping mass .",
    "@xmath65    being @xmath66 the reduced mass , and @xmath67 the total mass .",
    "in order to evaluate the maximum distance at which lisa would be able to detect the close white dwarf binary systems studied here we have adopted @xmath68 . we have furthermore used the integrated sensibility of lisa as obtained from http://www.srl.caltech.edu/@xmath69shane/sensitivity .",
    "the results are given in table 2 , where the frequency of the close white dwarf binary system when the secondary overflows its roche lobe , the chirping mass , the maximum distance at which lisa would detect them for a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 and one year integration , and the signal - to - noise ratio at 10  kpc for one year integration are shown .",
    "also shown in table 2 are the peak amplitude at 10  kpc of the dimensionless strain ( in units of @xmath41 ) and the total radiated energy in the form of gravitational waves .",
    "we stress that if the merger occurs during the one year integration period the signal - to - noise ratio would be smaller .",
    "it is worth noticing as well that the energy radiated away from the binary system during the coalescence in the form of gravitational waves is of the order of @xmath70  erg , much smaller than the total energy of the system and , hence , totally negligible in the energy budget , so no back reaction should be taken into account and the procedure used here is robust .",
    "note as well , that for the case of @xmath71 system , in which two resolutions were used the maximum distance at which lisa would be able to detect the coalescence is very similar for both the high resolution simulation , 12.8  pc , and the low resolution simulation , 13.0  pc .",
    "the energy released during the coalescence is very similar as well in both cases , 0.63 and @xmath72  erg , respectively .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ graf_snr ] we compare the signal produced by the close white dwarf binary systems studied in this paper , when a distance of 10  kpc is adopted , with the spectral distribution of noise of lisa for a one year integration period . as it can be seen , all of them will be eventually detected , at different signal - to - noise ratios , ranging from @xmath73 for the @xmath74 system to @xmath75 for the @xmath76 system .",
    "we have computed the emission of gravitational waves of merging white dwarf binaries , for a wide range of masses and compositions of the components of the binary system . for that purpose",
    "we have used a sph code which allowed us to follow the temporal evolution of the coalescing white dwarfs .",
    "we have shown that the most noticeable feature of the emitted signal is a sudden disappearance of the gravitational strains .",
    "by contrast the chirping phase will be easily detectable by future space - borne interferometers like lisa .",
    "in fact , it can be said that the most relevant signature of the merger will be the absence of any signature and the sudden disappearance of the source .",
    "since the frequency coverage of lisa will range from @xmath77 to @xmath78  hz , the detection of chirping close white dwarf binary systems is guaranteed ( farmer & phinney 2003 ; nelemans et al .",
    "moreover , at frequencies of @xmath79  hz most close white dwarf binary systems will be spectrally resolved ( cornish & larson 2003 ) .",
    "typically , lisa will be able to detect @xmath80 binaries at these frequencies ( seto 2002 ) .",
    "additonally , it has been recently shown ( cooray , farmer & seto 2004 ) that the typical error box of lisa for these kind of systems will be @xmath81  deg@xmath82 , and that , given that many of the detected sources will be eclipsing binaries with a period equal to that of the gravitational waves , optical follow - up campaigns will allow us to further constrain the location of the sources .",
    "hence , by combining optical observations and gravitational wave data , and taking into account that the gravitational wave signal for such mergers suddenly vanishes  or , equivalently , that during the integration period the signal - to - noise ratio stops growing  we should be able to gain insight into the physics of merging and to obtain precise information of the properties of the progenitor systems .",
    "moreover , it should be taken into account that for a typical merger  namely , the @xmath83 case  the volume accesible to lisa is @xmath84  pc@xmath85 . since the volume of the galaxy is @xmath86  pc@xmath85 , lisa would be able to detect all the mergers occuring in our galaxy during its operation period . however , the typical rate of white dwarf mergers is @xmath87  yr@xmath88 ( nelemans 2003 ) and , hence , although there is an uncertainty of a factor of 5 in the rate of white dwarf mergers , the expected detection rate is consequently small .",
