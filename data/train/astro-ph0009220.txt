    "the first sign of cosmic evolution among infrared ( ir ) galaxies was detected by hacking , condon and houck ( 1987 ) in the iras 60@xmath0 deep survey ( hacking and houck 1987 ) .",
    "this was subsequently confirmed by later studies of iras galaxy populations ( franceschini et al .",

    ", deep mir - fir surveys have been carried out using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) ( kessler et al .",
    "these include isocam surveys at 15@xmath0 , 12@xmath0 and at 6.7@xmath0 ( see elbaz et al .",
    "1998b for a summary of these observations ) , isophot surveys at 90@xmath0 ( oliver et al .",

    "; puget et al . 1999 ; dole et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the results from these surveys ( aussel et al . 1999 ; puget et al . 1999 ; dole et al .",
    "2001 ; clements et al . 1999 ; elbaz et al . 1999 ; serjeant et al .",
    "2000 ; xu 2000 ) indicate strong cosmic evolution in the population of infrared - emitting galaxies , confirming the earlier results based on smaller samples and less sophisticated analyses ( e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ; kawara et al .",
    "this is consistent with the results of scuba surveys ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ; blain et al . 1999 ) and with the scenario hinted at by the newly discovered cosmic ir background ( cib ) ( puget et al . 1996",
    "; hauser et al . 1998 ; dwek et al . 1998 ; fixsen et al . 1998 ) , while challenging the results from uv / optical surveys in the sense that substantially more ( i.e. a factor of 3  5 ) star formation in the earlier universe is required to match the ir / submm counts and the cib ( see , e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ) compared to that derived from the uv / optical surveys ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; pozzetti et al . 1998 , steidel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is attributed to dust extinction which may hide much of the star formation in the early universe from the uv / optical surveys ( see lonsdale 2000 for a review ) .",
    "compared to the uv and optical surveys , the infrared surveys are superior in their insensitivity to dust extinction , but are inferior in angular resolution ( a few arcsecond compared to the sub - arcsecond resolution of optical surveys ) .",
    "this not only limits the ir surveys by confusion , but also makes the study of the ir morphology of faint ir sources impossible . in order to reveal the true nature of faint ir sources , identifications in other bands , especially in optical and nir bands where",
    "the sources can be resolved easily with current instruments , are usually needed .",

    "( 1997 ) and aussel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and of the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) field by flores et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that , compared to their optical counterparts , the isocam sources have significantly redder ( i - k ) colors ( flores et al . 1999 ) , and are much more likely to be in the interacting / merging systems . on the other hand ,",
    "such studies are necessarily confined to ir sources that are relatively bright in the optical ( e.g. @xmath12 mag , flores et al .",
    "1999 ) , while many ir bright galaxies are optically faint due to heavy dust extinction .",
    "iras studies showed that galaxies of different nature in the local universe have distinct ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "galaxies with bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) usually have significantly lower @xmath13 ratios ( de grijp1985 ; fang et al .",
    "1998 ) than other galaxies .",
    "interacting / starburst galaxies such as m82 have systematically high @xmath14 and @xmath15 ratios than normal galaxies such as the milky way ( e.g. helou 1986 ) . in principle , these different characteristics in the ir seds for different populations of galaxies should facilitate a tool for identifications of ir galaxies when multi - band ir surveys are available , independent of the optical identifications . for iso surveys",
    "this may not be very relevant because the isophot fir surveys do not match the isocam mir surveys in depth due to severe degradation of the sensitivity of isophot detectors .",
    "however , when the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) is launched in mid 2002 , simultaneous deep surveys in seven mir - fir bands ( 3.6@xmath0 , 4.5@xmath0 , 5.8@xmath0 , 8.0@xmath0 , 24@xmath0 , 70@xmath0 , and 160@xmath0 ) will be possible ( bicay et al .",
    "these will include the guaranteed time observer programs with mips and irac ( sirtf.caltech.edu/roc/titles_abstracts.html ) , the large - area legacy survey swire ( lonsdale _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; and the very deep legacy survey goods ( dickinson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "significant k corrections will occur in the observed seds of faint sources in deep ir surveys . in particular , in the rest frame wavelength range between 320there",
    "are several broad band features ( see puget and lger 1989 for a review ) , often referred to the unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) , which are ubiquitously present in the mir spectra of local galaxies with equivalent widths up to several microns ( helou et al .",
    "2000 ) , with the exception of type 1 seyferts ( clavel et al .",
    "if these features are also present in the seds of high redshift galaxies , substantial k - corrections will result in when any of the features redshifts in or out of the band pass of an ir filter .",
    "these effects may indeed be beneficial rather than annoying , for they may facilitate ir photometric redshift techniques .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter paper i ) studied the effect of k - corrections due to uibs on number counts of mir surveys . in that work ,",
    "a three - component model , with empirically determined mir sed templates of ( 1 ) a cirrus / pdr component ( 2 ) a starburst component and ( 3 ) an agn component , is developed for infrared ( 3120 ) seds of galaxies .",
    "the model is then applied to a complete iras 25selected sample of 1406 local galaxies ( @xmath16 ; shupe et al .",
    "results based on these 1406 spectra show that the mir emission features cause significant effects on the redshift dependence of the k - corrections , which in turn affect deep counts and redshift distributions in mir surveys . in a subsequent paper , xu ( 2000 , hereafter paper ii ) found that indeed the sharp peak at about 0.4mjy in the euclidean normalized differential counts at 15@xmath0 ( elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ) can be explained by the effects of uibs , together with an evolution rate significantly stronger than derived in previous iras studies , eliminating the need for a hypothetical new population ( elbaz 1998a ) .    in this paper , we expand the models in paper i in several aspects .",
    "\\(1 ) first of all , the analytical algorithm of the number count model which includes a proper treatment of the k - correction ( eqs ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) in paper i ) is replaced by a monte - carlo algorithm , in which every source ( galaxy ) in a volume of given redshift and in a given luminosity bin is assigned an sed appropriately selected from the sed library ( 837 seds ) .",
    "the source s flux densities in different bands are then calculated by convolving the redshifted sed with the band passes of filters . in this way",
    ", we effectively simulate a virtual sky for a given evolution model .",
    "this not only enables the simultaneous comparison of counts in different bands , but also preserves the correlations between flux densities of different bands . this latter feature allowing us to predict color - color diagrams of different populations as a function of redshift , facilitating the exploration of photometric redshift indicators .",
    "\\(2 ) in the backward evolution model , instead of treating all ir sources as a single population , in this work they are separated into three populations , in a similar spirit as in the model of franceschini et al .",
    "( 1988 ; see also roche and eales 1999 ) : ( 1 ) normal late - type galaxies , ( 2 ) interacting / starburst galaxies , and ( 3 ) galaxies with agns .",
    "these different populations are assumed to have different cosmic evolution rates .",
    "\\(3 ) the wavelength coverage of our sed library is expanded from 3120@xmath0 to 1000  20 cm .",
    "this is done by collecting from the literature the optical / nir ( b , j , h , ks bands ) magnitudes and the radio continuum ( 20 cm ) flux densities for galaxies in our sed sample , and by extrapolating from iras 60@xmath0 and 100@xmath0 bands to submm bands using empirically determined correlations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a set of comprehensive backward evolution models ( a category of galaxy evolution models in which number densities and other properties , e.g. luminosities in different bands , of local galaxies are evolved backward in time from the present  i.e. with increasing redshift  according to some parametric prescriptions , see lonsdale 2000 for a review ) for future multi - band surveys , in particular those to be conducted with sirtf .",
    "the model parameters will be constrained by observations available in the literature .",
    "this not only includes the iso deep surveys , but also the optical / nir surveys , scuba surveys and radio deep surveys , because our seds now cover all of these wavebands .",
    "constraints derived from the cosmic ir background ( cib ) will also be incorporated .",
    "the strength of models being constrained by such wide range of data has already been demonstrated in several previous papers ( e.g. blain et al .",
    "1999 ; trentham , blain and goldader 1998 ; adelberger and steidel 2000 ; rowan - robinson 2001 ) .",
    "the model focuses on ir - bright galaxies , and therefore is not expected to match observed number counts in any band for which there is a substantial contribution from ir - quiet populations , eg . the k band , because e / s0 populations are missing from our model , and the bright radio counts , which are dominated by radio galaxies .    throughout the paper , the cosmology model specified by the following parameters",
    "is adopted : h@xmath10=75 km sec@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath17 .",
    "as in paper i , our sed sample is drawn from the iras 25selected sample ( complete down to @xmath18  jy ) by shupe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and contains 1455 galaxies , 1406 of them with redshifts @xmath19 . as pointed out by spinoglio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the mir luminosities correlate well with the bolometric luminosities",
    ". therefore mir selected samples , such as ours , have fair representations of different populations of ir sources",
    ". however e / s0s , which are @xmath20 of optically selected galaxy samples but mostly undetected by iras , are not included in our sed sample .    in paper",
    "i , a three - component ( cirrus / pdr , starburst , and agn ) mir - sed model is applied to these galaxies , predicting an sed from 3120for each of them . in order to expand the seds to the optical and nir bands , b ( 4400 ) , j ( 1.0 ) , h ( 1.6 ) , and ks ( 2.2 ) , we searched the literature .",
    "b magnitudes of 1339 galaxies were found in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the nir magnitudes are taken mainly from the 2mass second incremental data release via the irsa facility where j , h , and ks magnitudes of 790 galaxies were found .",
    "in addition , nir magnitudes of 413 galaxies in our sample are given in spinoglio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , 244 of which are overlapped with the 2mass matchs . whenever nir magnitudes are available from both 2mass and spinoglio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , 2mass data take precedence .",
    "altogether , j h and ks magnitudes are found for 959 galaxies in our sample .",
    "the radio continuum flux densities at 20 cm , @xmath21 , were searched for in both the nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) and first ( becker et al . 1995 ) catalogs of nrao . among 1406 galaxies in our sample 1170",
    "are found in one of these two surveys ( the rest are in the sky area not visible by vla ) .",
    "it is found that 854 galaxies in our sample have b , j , h , ks magnitudes and radio continuum flux at 1.4ghz . after excluding 17 galaxies which were undetected by iras both in the 60and 100bands ( whose ir seds are highly uncertain ) , we select a final sed sample of 837 galaxies . note that the 569 galaxies in the original sample ( 1406 galaxies ) that do not make it into the final sed sample are mostly galaxies without nir magnitudes",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that data for nir sources in a large fraction of the sky has not been releaseded by the 2mass survey ( the major source of the nir data ) yet .",
    "since both the 2mass survey and the vla surveys are much deeper than the iras survey , the nir magnitudes or the 20 cm flux density is missing for a source in the 25@xmath0 selected sample only when the sky region is missing in the corresponding database . therefore no bias is introduced into the final sed sample when sources without nir or radio fluxes are excluded .    for each galaxy in the sed sample ,",
    "the broad - band uv - optical - nir ( 1000  4 ) sed is estimated by a spline fit of the fluxes in b , j , h , ks bands , altogether with the predicted 4flux density from the mir sed model ( paper i ) . it should be noted that at the uv wavelengths ( 1000  4000 ) the predicted fluxes are extrapolations from the available data , and caution should be applied when these predictions are used .",
    "this aspect of the model will be improved in the next paper , using the new uv data that are just now becoming available for ulirgs and other ir - bright galaxies .",
    "the mir ( 4  16@xmath0 ) sed is determined using the mir sed model developed in paper i , including a full treatment of the uib features ( absent in type 1 agn ) .",
    "then the sed in the wavelength range 16  1200 @xmath0 is specified by a spline fit of iras data at 25 , 60 , 100 , together with the 16flux density predicted by the mir sed model , and the 170@xmath0 , 240@xmath0 , 450@xmath0 , 850@xmath0 and 1200@xmath0 flux densities predicted by empirical correlations between the given submm band flux and the iras 60@xmath0 and 100@xmath0 fluxes which are derived from available submm data collected from the literature ( appendix ) .",
    "the radio continuum flux density at 20 cm ( @xmath21 ) is extrapolated to 6.2 cm ( @xmath22 ) and 2.8 cm ( @xmath23 ) using the mean spectral indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , found for shapley - ames galaxies ( niklas et al .",
    "these radio flux densities are then linked to the end of the ir / submm sed at 1200@xmath0 by spline fit .    in fig.1",
    "we show the seds which are binned according to population ( see the next section ) and the 25@xmath0 luminosity ( table  1 ) . for each bin ,",
    "the mean sed and its 1@xmath26 dispersion are also plotted in the corresponding panel in fig.1 , and the values are listed in table 2 .",
    "as examples , in fig.2 observational data of twelve well known galaxies are compared with model seds .",
    "the data are collected from the literature , and the sources are    * broad band optical magnitudes : ned ; * nir magnitudes : 2mass and spinoglio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; * fir / submm flux densities : iras , benford ( 1999 ) , dunne et al .",

    "( 1986 ) , andreani and franceschini ( 1996 ) , roche and chandler ( 1993 ) ; * radio continuum flux densities : niklas et al . ( 1995 ) , condon et al . ( 1990 ) .",
    "the agreements between the data and the model seds are remarkably good in general .",
    "in paper i and paper ii , it is assumed that all ir sources evolve as a single population . here",
    "we improve on that formulation by adopting a model in which ir sources can be separated into three populations , in a similar spirit as in the model of franceschini et al .",
    "( 1988 ; see also roche and eales 1999 ) : ( 1 ) normal late - type galaxies , ( 2 ) interacting / starburst galaxies , and ( 3 ) galaxies with agns .    to enable these different galaxy populations to evolve at different rates",
    ", the model requires a local luminosity function ( llf ) for each component .",
    "we began with the 25@xmath0 flux density - limited sample of 1455 galaxies of shupe et al .",
    "although classifications of many of the galaxies as agns , normal galaxies , etc .",
    "are available in databases such as ned , to treat the sample in a more uniform way , we use ir - color - based criteria to divide our sample into different populations ( see paper i and fang et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "we chose the following iras color boundaries :    *  agns \" : @xmath27 *  starbursts \" : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . *",
    " normals \" : @xmath28 and @xmath30 .    this division results in 356 galaxies classified as",
    " agns \" , 456 galaxies as  normal \" , and 643 galaxies as  starburst \" .",
    "we note that our color - selection method for agn will not be appropriate for heavily obscured objects in which even the @xmath31 color may be affected by reddening ; instead any such ir - red agn will be found in the ` starburst ' sample .",
    "also , for many agns as defined above , much of the ir radiation can be due to the emission of dust heated by stars in the host galaxy in addition to the dust emission associated with the agn .",
    "for example , according to eq(1 ) of paper i , an ir source of @xmath32 ( an ` agn ' by the above definition ) has a half of its 25@xmath0 emission from dust heated by stars . in reality , seyfert galaxies such as ngc  4945 ( spoon et al .",
    "2000 ) can have the ir emission predominantly powered by the nuclear starburst rather than by the agn .",
    "this explains why the seds of some sources in the agn subsample of our sed library show significant broad band mir emission features ( fig.1a ) which should be absent in a typical type 1 agn sed ( e.g. fig.3 of paper i ) .",
    "at the same time , as shown in fig.2 , the uib features are indeed absent in the model seds of agns such as mrk  231 amd ngc  7479 , consistent with the fact that the emission in these sources is dominated by the agn .",
    "it should also be noted that in our sed model ( paper i ) , we do not distinguish type 1 and type 2 agns , which have significantly different mir seds ( clavel et al .",
    "many type 2 agns have strong uib features even when their ir emission may be predominantly from dust associated with agn , because an edge - on torus may heavily extinguish the mir part of the agn - associated emission and therefore the detected mir emission is mostly from dust in the ism of the host galaxy ( clavel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "luminosity functions were then computed for each of these populations according to the maximum - likelihood method described in yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and used in shupe et al .",
    "this method calculates the shape of a parametric luminosity function described by the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 independent of density variations .    with the shape parameters in hand ,",
    "the normalization of each luminosity function must be estimated by other methods . since the normalization of the total 25 micron luminosity function was estimated in shupe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the normalizations of the three population lfs are chosen so that the the number of galaxies implied by the sum of the component lfs is about the same as the total lf .",
    "the difference between the total lf and summed lf is also constrained to be less than a few percent at all luminosities .",
    "we have adjusted the normalizations of the component lfs to satisfy these criteria .",
    "these relative weightings of the component lfs can be adjusted by ten to twenty percent while still satisfying the criteria , but can not be made vastly different from the nominal values .    a plot of the component luminosity functions , the sum of the component lfs , and the total lf is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the computed parameters for each population are given in table 3 .",
    "note that the lfs are calculated using the whole sample ( 1455 galaxies ) of shupe et al .",

    "1999 ; serjeant et al . 2000 ) , where the deepest and the most comprehensive iso surveys have been conducted . due to significant effects caused by the uibs , certain features in the mir counts can help to constrain the rate of luminosity evolution and that of density evolution separately ( paper i ) .",
    "if the sharp peak at @xmath97 in the euclidean normalized differential counts is indeed due to the uibs in 6  8 @xmath0 ( paper ii ) , which are redshifted into the 15@xmath0 band when @xmath98 , then a 15@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 at 15@xmath0 ) could be inferred for a typical z=1 isocam galaxy .",
    "this imposes a strong constraint to the luminosity evolution rate of the major population of the isocam sources , which under our assumptions ( section 3.3 ) are the starburst galaxies , at @xmath101 .    in fig.7a and fig.7b , we compare the simulations of two evolution models , one has @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath73 and @xmath104 ( model 1 , ` peak model ' ) and the other @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath73 and @xmath105 ( model 2 , ` flat model ' ) with the number counts of isocam 15@xmath0 data surveys ( elbaz et al . 1999 ; serjeant et al .",

    "however , since the redshift data are not complete and the high redshifts are more likely to be missing ( more difficult to measure ) , and since the hdf - north is such a tiny field that any cluster at a given redshift ( e.g. at @xmath115 ) can affect the redshift distribution significantly , we feel this discrepancy is not inconsistent with our models .",
    "the cfrs survey is shallower ( and wider ) than the hdf - north survey , but its redshift distribution is more skewed toward the high z end , supporting our argument that the z distribution of the isocam sources in the hdf - north field might not be representative for @xmath116 sources .",

    "it appears that the model prediction is significantly below the counts of k @xmath128 , though there are only two data points there .",
    "a tentative comparison with hst nicmos h band deep counts ( storrie - lombardi , private communication ) shows that the ` peak model ' predicts about 50% of the nir counts down to h=26.5 mag .    in fig.16 , we compare predicted contributions from ir sources to the b band counts . since the e / s0 galaxies constituent only @xmath20 of the optical galaxies ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is a general result holding even for a very faint sample down to @xmath129 mag ( driver et al . 1995 ) , ir - bright sources should dominate the b band counts . the discrepancy near the bright end ( @xmath130 ) could be explained by the local density enhancement ( local super - cluster ) . at the faint end ( @xmath131 ) , the ` peak model ' also slightly under - predicts the counts by @xmath132 .",
    "it should be noted that at these faint b band flux levels , where many sources have high redshifts and the b band flux is actually due to the rest frame uv emission , the model predictions suffer large uncertainties because the uv seds used in the calculation are not well constrained ( section 2 ) .",
    "this will be the focus of our next paper .    in the radio continuum 20 cm band ,",
    "the bright sources ( @xmath133 ) are mostly due to the early - type radio galaxies ( condon 1984 ) which are not ir emitters , while the faint , sub - mjy sources are mostly late - type galaxies ( condon 1984 ) .",
    "this is indeed what the ` peak model ' predicts ( fig.17 ) : at flux levels brighter than 1 mjy , the ir sources contribute less than 10% of radio counts . at faint flux levels ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "they can fully account for the radio counts .",
    "in this section we will make predictions using our best - fit model ( ` peak model ' ) .",

    "all three mips bands ( 24@xmath0 , 70@xmath0 , 160@xmath0 ) and all four irac bands ( 3.6@xmath0 , 4.5@xmath0 , 5.8@xmath0 and 8@xmath0 ) bands are considered . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume all sirtf bandpasses are 10% ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "we note that , since the e / s0 galaxies are not included in the model , we may significantly underpredict the counts in the irac bands , particularly for the shorter wavelength bands ( i.e. the 3.6@xmath0 , 4.5@xmath0 , and 5.8@xmath0 bands ) . therefore , our predictions for the counts and the confusion limits in these bands should be treated as lower limits .",
    "in fig.18 we plot the predicted integral counts for the three mips bands and three irac bands ( 3.6@xmath0 , 5.8@xmath0 and 8@xmath136 ) . in all mips bands , the counts are dominated by the starburst component ( including any heavily obscured agn ) . in the irac bands , normal spirals and galaxies with agns give significant contributions to counts brighter than 0.3mjy ( in the 3.6@xmath0 and 5.8@xmath0 bands they out - number the starbursts ) . at fainter flux levels ( @xmath137 )",

    "specifically , an effective diameter of 82 cm is used for 5.8@xmath0 , and 51 cm is used for 3.6@xmath0 .",
    "as noted above , the confusion limits for the short wavelength irac bands such as the 5.8@xmath0 and the 3.6@xmath0 bands should be treated as lower limits because of the omission of the contribution from counts due to e / s0 galaxies .",
    "also for the mips 160@xmath0 band , confusion caused by galactic cirrus may be significant , especially in high cirrus regions ( gautier et al . 1992 ; helou and beichman 1990 ) .    in fig.19 redshift distributions predicted by the best - fit model ( ` peak model ' ) and by the ` flat model ' are plotted . for a 24@xmath0 survey limited at @xmath138 ( 5@xmath139 ) ,",
    "the best - fit model predicts a prominent peak at about z=1 .",
    "the starburst component overwhelmingly dominates the counts at @xmath140 , while the normal galaxies dominate the small z end .",
    "the contribution from galaxies with agns is never important ( @xmath141 ) , although it could be significantly higher for obscured agns classified here as `` starbusrts '' due to their colors .",
    "the shape of the redshift distribution predicted by the ` flat model ' is very different , with a second peak at @xmath117 , caused mainly by the prominent uib features between 6  8@xmath0 ( paper i ) .",
    "this peak is cut off in the ` peak model ' because of the steep decrease of the star - formation rate at z@xmath1421.5 .",
    "however , the turn - over redshift @xmath66 , which has been assumed to be 1.5 in all our models presented here , is poorly constrained because iso surveys are too shallow whereas the scuba and cib are more sensitive to sources at @xmath143 .",
    "if in reality @xmath144 , then it will be revealed by the second peak at @xmath117 in the redshift distribution of sirtf 24@xmath0 sources .      in fig.20a and fig.20b",
    "we plot the @xmath145 vs. @xmath146 color - color diagrams predicted by the ` peak model ' and the ` flat model ' , respectively .",
    "simulations of both models are confined to 1 deg@xmath147 with the following flux limits : @xmath148 ( 5@xmath139 ) and @xmath149 ( 2@xmath139 ) .",

    "galaxies with agns are mostly in the relatively low @xmath150 ratio region ( @xmath151 ) , while starburst galaxies dominate the high @xmath150 ratio region ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "normal galaxies , with relatively low luminosities and therefore seen only with @xmath153 , are concentrated in the low @xmath145 ratio region .",
    "it should be pointed out that these trends are closely related to our definitions of the three populations ( section 2 ) , which are separated according to the iras color ratios of @xmath31 and @xmath154 . while the criteria adopted are based on empirical correlations ( fang et al .",
    "1998 ; paper i ) , the clear boundaries in the definitions of the different populations will have artificially enhanced the trend shown here .",

    "the symbols are the same as in fig.20 . in these plots , in addition to the flux cut - offs of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , it is also required that @xmath158 ( 2@xmath139 ) .",
    "the simulations cover 10 deg@xmath147 .",
    "most high z galaxies ( large crosses in the plots ) are concentrated in the high @xmath159 end ( @xmath160 ) , due to the k - correction effect associated with the curvature in the 20160@xmath0 wavelength range in most of the seds in our library .",
    "the apparent ` tracks ' in these figures are a result of the manner in which an sed is selected for each simulated galaxy from the sed library . as luminosity increases with increasing z ( for luminosity evolution models ) a model galaxy",
    "is assigned a random sed from the relevant luminosity bin .",
    "some bins contain small numbers of seds so the ` tracks ' reflect single seds randomly assigned to model galaxies at higher and higher z ( and therefore l ) .",
    "the ` tracks ' can discontinue when model populations ` jump ' to higher sed library luminosity bins .",
    "although small random scatter could be incorporated into these model colors , we have chosen not to do that so that the figures can be more easily analyzed .",
    "the irac color - color diagrams , such as @xmath161 vs. @xmath162 diagram , are affected by the exclusion of e / s0 galaxies in our current models .",
    "also the nir spectral features considered by simpson and eisenhardt ( 1999 ) , e.g. the 1.6@xmath0 h@xmath163 opacity minimum and the 2.3@xmath0 co bandhead , are not considered in our sed model ( section 2 ) , therefore the changes in the irac colors due to the k - correction caused by these features are absent in our model predictions .",
    "improvements in these aspects will be addressed in our next paper .",
    "three new features separate the models presented here from the previous models in paper i and paper ii :    \\(1 ) an approach even more empirical than that used in paper i is adopted in this work .",
    "realistic seds of local galaxies are attached to sources of all redshifts .",
    "this not only enabled reliable k - corrections , but also linked the surveys in different bands coherently . because of this feature , our model is the first in the literature that can predict the correlations and the dispersions in color - color diagrams for multi - band surveys .",
    "\\(2 ) the mir - fir seds in the sed sample are extended to a much wider range covering from uv ( 1000 ) to radio ( 20 cm ) .",
    "this links the model predictions for ir surveys to the optical and radio continuum surveys .",
    "because of the wide wavelength coverage , our model can calculate the contributions from the ir sources to the cosmic background from optical to radio bands .",
    "\\(3 ) instead of evolving all ir sources as a single population , they are divided into three populations ( normal late - types , starbursts , and galaxies with agn ) which are assumed to evolve differently . given the observational evidence ( aussel et al .",
    "1999 ; elbaz et al . 1999 ; flores et al . 1999 ) , most of the evolution is attributed to the starburst ( interacting ) galaxies .    in paper ii , it was found that a pure luminosity evolution of form @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) can fit the isocam 15@xmath0 surveys and iras 60@xmath0 surveys best ( both surveys are insensitive to the evolution at @xmath108 ) .",
    "this evolution rate is significantly stronger than those derived in previous iras studies ( @xmath166 ) , while at same time it confirms that luminosity evolution models fit the data better than density evolution models ( e.g. pearson and rowan - robinson 1996 ) .    in this paper , while assuming that normal late - types and galaxies with agns undergo pure luminosity evolution ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively ) , we found that a model assuming that both the luminosity and the density of starburst galaxies evolve significantly ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) before the turn - over redshift ( z=1.5 ) , fits the data best .",
    "a model with more luminosity evolution and less density evolution ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) predicted a peak in the euclidean normalized differential counts at 15@xmath0 too shallow and too bright compared to the data ( fig.7c ) .",
    "another model with less luminosity evolution and more density evolution ( @xmath168 and @xmath173 ) , while fitting well the 15@xmath0 counts , predicted too much ir background ( fig.7d and fig.8a ) .",
    "the prediction of our best - fit model of a density evolution of starburst galaxies on the order of @xmath174 is consistent with the theoretical prediction ( carlberg et al .",
    "1994 ) and with previous observations ( infante et al .",
    "1996 ; roche and eales 1999 ; le fvre et al",
    ". 2000 ) of the evolution of merger rate .",
    "it is also very consistent with the close relation between starbursts and galaxy interactions / mergers ( see sanders and mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "the constraints on the evolution of ir sources at @xmath108 are set by the cib and the 850@xmath0 scuba counts .",
    "because of the negative k - correction , high redshift galaxies contribute significantly to the source counts and the cosmic background in the submm bands .",
    "it is found that in order to avoid over - predicting the cib and the scuba counts , a steep decrease after z=1.5 , in the form of @xmath6 , in the evolution of ir sources is required .",
    "this is different from the result in paper ii , where the ` flat model ' ( luminosity and density remain constant after z=1.5 ) can fit the cib satisfactorily ( fig.7 of paper ii ) .",
    "this is due to the difference in the submm seds adopted in these two papers . in paper ii a single template for the submm seds is adopted for all sources , specified by t=40k and @xmath175 ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this paper , the submm seds are determined using empirical correlations between iras fluxes and the submm fluxes .",
    "this results in a higher submm luminosity for a given mir luminosity ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "since little is known about the ir - submm seds of high z sources , and we can not test our assumption that the correlations between the ir and submm fluxes of local galaxies can be applied to high z galaxies , the rapid decrease of the sfr predicted by our best - fit model is highly uncertain .    because of the steep decrease after z=1.5 , our best - fit model predicts a redshift distribution with a single peak at z@xmath114 for a survey with @xmath177 ( 5@xmath139 ) .",
    "this is very different from the double peaked distribution predicted by the ` flat model ' ( fig.19 , see also fig.14c of paper i ) .",
    "this provides a straightforward test to distinguish these models once the redshifts of a sample of sirtf 24@xmath0 sources are obtained .      in the multi - ir - band model of roche and eales ( 1999 )",
    ", a density evolution of @xmath178 is also assumed .",
    "however , the luminosity evolutionary rate of starburst galaxies found by roche and eales ( 1999 ) , @xmath179 ( @xmath153 ) , is significantly weaker than predicted by our best - fit model : @xmath180 ( @xmath93 ) .      compared to the other two populations ( normal late - types and galaxies with agns ) , our best - fit model predicts much stronger evolution for z@xmath1811.5 in the starburst galaxies population .",
    "this is similar to the model of dole et al .",
    "however , they confine their starburst component , called ulirgs , to galaxies with @xmath182 . in order to fit the iso counts they have to evolve the ulirg population significantly , resulting in a break in the evolved luminosity function at z=2.5 ( fig.3a of dole et al .",

    "while rr01 predict that most of these sources ( cirrus and starbursts ) have @xmath193 ( median @xmath194 ) , our best - fit model predicts the opposite , namely most of sources ( starbursts ) have @xmath140 ( median @xmath114 ) .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the different evolution rates of normal - spirals ( cirrus galaxies ) in the two models : in our best - fit model , the evolution rate of the normals is rather low ( evolution index = 1.5 ) .",
    "since the normals dominate sources in the local universe , the evolution rate of overall ir sources at low z is low in our best - fit model .",
    "only when the starbursts overtake the normals as the dominant population , which occurs at @xmath195 , does the high evolution rate of the starbursts start to significantly affect the ir sources on the whole . on the other hand , in rr01 ,",
    "all populations evolve with the same rate .",
    "so the evolution index is @xmath196 at small redshifts for normal spirals .",
    "consequently , as shown in the upper panel of fig.23 , the star formation rate ( roughly proportional to the luminosity density ) of rr01 is about a factor of 2 higher than our best - fit model at @xmath197 .",
    "the sfr predicted by our best - fit model starts to catch up with rr01 at larger z and then overshoots until z@xmath198 .",
    "it follows that a redshift survey of sirtf sources in the 70@xmath0 band will serve as a good test to distinguish the models .",
    "it should be noted that for the sample of faint iras 60@xmath136 sources ( @xmath199 mjy , oliver et al .",
    "1996 ) , our best - fit model predicts too many ( about a factor of 10 ) sources with z@xmath200 compared to the observations ( 6 out of 1400 : rowan - robinson , private communication ) . however , it is not very clear to what extent the discrepancy is due to biases introduced by large scale structures and by the incompleteness of the redshift survey ( see the end of section 4 ) .",

    ", our model predicts that the ir - submm cib is predominantly due to the starburst galaxies .",
    "the best - fit model of rr01 predicts that most of the cib is due to cirrus galaxies ( close to normals in our model ) which , because they are assumed to evolve as strongly as starburst galaxies , maintain their dominance to the ir emission from the local universe throughout the high - z universe .",
    "both of our models predict negligible contributions from agns to the cib ( @xmath201 at any given wavelength ) , although the ` starburst ' model populations could include a significant heavily obscured segment of the agn population that are thought to contribute significantly to the cosmic xray background ( xrb ; eg .",

    "then the so - called `` madau - diagram '' has been revised many times through various improvements , including ( 1 ) the corrections for the effect of dust extinction on uv / optical luminosities ( madau et al . 1998 ; pozzetti et al .",
    "1998 , steidel et al . 1999 ) , ( 2 ) results from less extinction sensitive balmer line surveys ( gallego et al . 1995 ; tresse and maddox 1998 ; yan et al . 1999 ; glazebrook et al . 1999 ) , ( 3 ) results from submm scuba surveys ( barger et al . 1999 ) .    adopting the conversion factor of kennicutt ( 1999 ) , sfr ( @xmath202 yr@xmath11)=@xmath203 ( erg s@xmath11 )",

    "is compared with the survey data found in the literature . not surprisingly , the model prediction is in very good agreement with the results from isocam surveys ( flores et al .",
    "1999 ) because at @xmath204 the model is constrained by the isocam data . on the other hand ,",
    "the model prediction is slightly higher than the results of the uv / optical and h@xmath33 surveys of @xmath93 . after the turn - over redshift",
    ", our best - fit model predicts a quick decrease , similar to what have been suggested by the uv data of lyman - break galaxies .    the ` flat model ' , represented by the dashed line , predicts too much cib ( fig.9 ) and too many counts in the scuba 850@xmath0 band ( fig.10 ) .",
    "the sfr of z@xmath205 galaxies predicted by the ` flat model ' is about a factor of 7 higher than those derived from the uv data of lyman - break galaxies , even after the uv data are corrected for the extinction ( about a factor of 3 , steidel et al .",
    "although we can not rule out the ` flat model ' because of the uncertainties associated with the evolution of the submm seds , and those associated with the extinction corrections of the uv data , it is certainly disfavored by our results .",
    "on the other hand models between the ` peak model ' and the ` flat model ' , such as the model 5 plotted by the dotted line ( see also fig.9 ) , are certainly allowed by our results .      the most important assumption in this work concerns the applicability of the sed vs. ir luminosity relation , found for local ir galaxies ( soifer and neugebauer 1991 ; fang et al . 1998 ) , for high z galaxies . namely we assume that the seds do not evolve with time for a given luminosity .",
    "note that this is different from assuming that the seds of galaxies do not evolve at all , because our models indeed predict strong luminosity evolution for ir galaxies and therefore , under our assumption , more galaxies in the early epochs have seds similar to local luminous ir galaxies which are significantly different from the seds of local l@xmath206 galaxies .",
    "this assumption is not very well constrained .",
    "not much is known about the ir seds of high z galaxies , in particular no current fir ( @xmath207 ) instrument is sensitive enough to detect them in the fir bands .",
    "a few @xmath208 galaxies have been identified in the isocam surveys ( predominantly in isocam 15@xmath0 surveys , aussel et al .",
    "et al . 1999 ; flores et al . 1999 ) , and the optical seds of some of them have been obtained using hst images ( flores et al .",
    "the submm scuba surveys ( hughes et al . 1998 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 ; blain et al . 1999 ) may have detected quite a few high z galaxies .",
    "but the positional uncertainties of the scuba sources are so large that it is very difficult to make cross identifications in other bands .",
    "in fact so far only a handful ( 3  5 , frayer : private communication ) high z scuba sources have published high confidence optical identifications and redshifts ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al . 1999 ; frayer et al .",
    "the most recent results of ivison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that indeed the seds of these galaxies have similar shapes to local ulirgs such as arp  220 or mrk  231 .",
    "high - z galaxies seen in deep surveys are high luminosity galaxies .",
    "thus , to the extent that they have similar seds to their local counterparts , our results will be valid .",
    "namely , intrinsically _ faint _ galaxies at high z may have different seds than their local counterparts , but this wo nt have any significant effect on the predictions for number counts and the cib .",
    "it is likely that in high z ulirgs the luminosities in all bands are predominantly radiated in localized starburst regions and/or agns , where the physical processes determining the luminosity and the sed ( e.g. agn related processes , star formation , radiative transfer , etc . )",
    "are similar to those in local ulirgs .",
    "in particular , both the theoretical arguments and observational evidence ( soifer et al . 1998 ; armus et al .",
    "1998 ) show that dust is produced rapidly after the first star formation episode in galaxies . therefore those high luminosity galactic nuclei in the early universe are likely to be optically thick ( soifer et al .",
    "1998 ; armus et al .",
    "1998 ) , similar to their local counterparts .",
    "it is expected that for large samples of galaxies seds covering 4000 160@xmath0 will be available when sirtf deep surveys and follow - up optical / nir surveys are carried out .",
    "then the assumption that the sed vs. ir luminosity relation of local ir galaxies also holds for high z galaxies will be fully tested .    throughout this paper , we have assumed the @xmath7 cosmology ( @xmath186 , @xmath185 ) , which is favored by recent observations of type i supernovae in distant galaxies ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; garnavich et al .",
    "compared to the standard @xmath188 , @xmath187 einstein - de sitter cosmology , the co - moving volume corresponding to a given z is significantly larger in the @xmath7 cosmology ( carroll et al .",
    "althogh this volume factor is partially balanced by relatively fainter flux for a given luminosity and given z in the @xmath7 cosmology , it still affects significantly the predictions of the scuba counts and the submm cib , where the contribution from high z sources is large .",
    "this is one of the reasons why a steep decrease after z=1.5 is favored by our best - fit model ( fig.26 ) . if the einstein - de sitter cosmology were adopted , a flatter sfr at early epochs would have been obtained .",
    "the assumptions for the evolution rates of normal late - type galaxies and of galaxies with agns ( section 3.3 ) are based on the results of optical and nir surveys of these sources .",
    "whether they also apply to the ir bands will have to be tested with future ir surveys ( e.g. sirtf surveys ) .",
    "nevertheless , if indeed most of the evolution in ir bright galaxies is due to starburst galaxies ( and possibly also highly obscured agn ) , as suggested by isocam surveys ( elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ; flores et al .",
    "1999 ) , these uncertainties will have minimal effects on our results for the overall ir evolution .    finally , the prominent peak at @xmath92 in the sfr v.s .",
    "redshift plot ( fig.25 ) is an artifact due to the simple two - step power - law function form adopted for the evolution functions ( eq(7 ) and eq(8 ) ) .",
    "however the sfr at z@xmath1811.5 is mostly constrained by the isocam 15@xmath0 surveys , which indeed reach as deep as z=1.5 . as was argued in paper ii",
    ", a very strong evolution all the way back to z@xmath209 is needed to explain the sharp peak at @xmath210 mjy in the euclidean normalized differential 15@xmath0 counts ( elbaz 1999 ) .",
    "we have developed empirical ` backward - evolution ' models for multiband ir surveys .",
    "a new monte - carlo algorithm is developed for this task .",
    "it exploits a large library consisting of realistic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 837 local ir galaxies ( iras 25@xmath0 selected ) from the uv ( 1000 ) to the radio ( 20 cm ) , including iso - measured 313@xmath0 unidentified broad features ( uibs ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the local correlation between seds and mid - infrared ( mir ) luminosities can be applied to earlier epochs of the universe .",
    "a @xmath7-cosmology ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) has been assumed through out the paper . by attaching an sed appropriately drawn from the sed library to every source predicted by a given model ,",
    "the algorithm enables simultaneous comparisons with multiple surveys in a wide range of wavebands .",
    "ir galaxies are divided into three populations : ( 1 ) normal late type galaxies ( normals ) , ( 2 ) starburst / interacting galaxies ( starbursts ) , and galaxies with agns ( agns ) .",
    "different cosmic evolution is assumed for these different populations . parameterized ( power - law ) luminosity evolution functions ( @xmath53 ) and density evolution functions ( @xmath52 ) of the form @xmath211 @xmath212",

    "the ` flat model ' , which is the same as the ` peak model ' at @xmath204 but @xmath105 at @xmath213 , over - predicts significantly the scuba counts and the cib .",
    "remarkably , the best - fit model ( ` peak model ' ) gives good fits simultaneously to all data ( both number counts and redshift distributions ) obtained from ir surveys , including isocam 15@xmath0 , isophot 90@xmath0 , 175@xmath0 , iras 60@xmath0 , and scuba 850@xmath0 .",
