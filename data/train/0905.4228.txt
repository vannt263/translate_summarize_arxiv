    "we start with a brief summary of the present status about the pentaquark baryon @xmath8 . since the leps collaboration announced the evidence of the @xmath8  @xcite , being motivated by diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite ( dpp ) , there has been a great deal of experimental and theoretical works on the @xmath8 ( see , for example , reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the clas collaboration reported null results of finding the @xmath8  @xcite in various reactions . in this",
    ", we also want to mention the earlier work @xcite .",
    "these null results from the clas experiment imply that the total cross sections for photoproductions of the @xmath8 should be very small . the kek - ps - e522 collaboration  @xcite found a bump at around @xmath9 mev but with only @xmath10 statistical significance .",
    "a later experiment at kek ( kek - ps - e559 ) , however , has observed no clear peak structure for the @xmath8 in the @xmath11 reaction  @xcite .    in the meanwhile ,",
    "the diana collaboration has recently brought news on a direct formation of a narrow @xmath12 peak with mass of @xmath13 mev .",
    "the width of @xmath14 mev was also found  @xcite .",
    "compared to the former measurement  @xcite , the decay width was more precisely measured , the statistics being doubled .",
    "the svd experiment has also announced a narrow peak with the mass , @xmath15 mev in the inclusive reaction @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the leps collaboration has reported again the evidence of the @xmath8  @xcite : the mass of the @xmath8 is found at @xmath17 mev and the statistical significance of the peak turns out to be @xmath18 .",
    "the differential cross section was estimated to be @xmath19 in the photon energy ranging from 2.0 gev to 2.4 gev in the leps angular range . in connection to the new leps results , diakonov and petrov recently discussed further thoretical aspects of the @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "based on these experimental results , regardless of the existence of the @xmath8 or not , one can come to the following three main conclusions :    1 .",
    "the decay width of the @xmath8 is very small ( @xmath20 mev ) , which indicates that the @xmath6 coupling should be tiny .",
    "the total cross section of the @xmath8 photoproduction is small .",
    "it implies that the @xmath21 coupling constant should be also very small .",
    "3 .   finding the @xmath8 may be reaction - dependent .",
    "we need to understand this smallness of the @xmath6 and @xmath21 coupling constants theoretically . in this",
    ", we will present results of recent investigations on the two coupling constants from the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath22qsm )  @xcite and of the application of these results to the photoproduction of the @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the present talk is schetched as follows : in section 2 , we review briefly the general formalism of the @xmath22qsm to show how to calculate the vector and axial - vector form factors . in section 3 , we present the results and discuss them .",
    "we also predict the decay width of the @xmath8 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the connection of the present reported results to the original work by dpp . in section 5",
    ", we describe the photoproduction of the @xmath23 using the results from the @xmath22qsm .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and conclusions of the present reported work .",
    "we start with the @xmath23-to - neutron transition matrix elements of the vector and axial - vector currents defined as : @xmath24u_{n}(\\bm{p})\\,\\,\\,,\\label{eq : vector - current}\\\\    & & \\langle\\theta(p^{\\prime})|\\bar{s}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5 u |n(p)\\rangle   = \\bar{u}_{\\theta}(\\bm{p}^{\\prime } ) \\left[g_{1}^{n\\theta}(q^{2 } )    \\gamma^{\\mu } + g_{2}^{n\\theta}(q^{2 } ) q^{\\mu } +    g_{3}^{n\\theta}(q^{2 } ) p^{\\mu}\\right]\\gamma^{5}\\ , u_{n}(\\bm{p})\\,\\,\\,,\\label{eq : axial - vector - current } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath25 denotes the spinor of the @xmath23 ( neutron ) with the corresponding mass @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 stands for the momentum transfer @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the total momentum @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for real transition form factors that will be related to the strong coupling constants for the @xmath2 and @xmath6 vertices with the help of the vector - meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite and goldberger - treiman relation .    in the vmd , the vector - transition current can be expressed as the @xmath33 current by the current field identity ( cfi ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote , respectively , the mass of the @xmath33 meson , @xmath37 mev , and decay constant defined as @xmath38 the decay constant @xmath39 for the rho meson can be determined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the electromagnetic fine - structure constant .",
    "the @xmath42 is determined by the experimental data for @xmath43-meson , @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 kev  @xcite , for which we obtain the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    using the cfi",

    "these relations yield immediately the strong coupling constants as @xmath51 using the generalized goldberger - treiman relation , we can get the strong coupling constant @xmath52 for the @xmath6 vertex as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for the kaon decay constant .    in the rest frame of the @xmath8 , the form factors @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vector - current],[eq : axial - vector - current ] ) can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of the vector and axial - vector currents with their time and space components decomposed in the @xmath8 rest frame , respectively @xmath58 where the electromagnetic - like sachs form factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are written as @xmath61 the vector and tensor coupling constants are therefor obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) as : @xmath62    we are now in a position to evaluate the form factors within the self - consistent @xmath22qsm .",
    "this model has the following virtues .",
    "there are only three free parameters among which two are fixed in the mesonic sector and just one remains for the whole baryon sector .",
    "this allows to calculate the @xmath8 transition form factors in the same frame as was used for the proton electromagnetic form factors .    the model is featured by the following effective low - energy partition function with quark fields @xmath63 with the number of colors @xmath64 and the pseudo - goldstone boson field @xmath65 in euclidean space : @xmath66= \\int\\mathcal{d}u\\exp ( -{\\bf \\mathcal{s}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}[u ] ) , \\label{eq : part}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath67 where @xmath68 the current - quark mass matrix is defined as @xmath69 .",

    ".the results for the @xmath21 and @xmath80 coupling constants at @xmath81 with and without @xmath82 corrections .",
    "the constituent quark mass @xmath71 is taken to be @xmath72 mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the stong influence of the @xmath82 corrections on these observables lies in a cancelation effect between the leading order and @xmath0 corrections .",
    "this effect was already observed in the work of dpp and led to the original prediction of the small @xmath8 decay width .",
    "note that the vector coupling constant @xmath83 vanishes in exact su(3 ) symmetry due to the generalized ademollo - gatto theorem , which will be explained below .",
    "the value of @xmath83 with su(3 ) symmetry breaking comes solely from the wavefunction corrections , so that the dirac transition form factor turns out to be @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the mixing parameter defined as @xmath86 with a symmetry - breaking part of the hamiltonian @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 denotes the mass of the antidecuplet neutron .",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ eq : ag ] ) as the generalized ademollo - gatto theorem .",
    "the results listed in table  [ tab : coup ] were obtained by using the value of the constituent - quark mass @xmath72 mev . however ,",
    "if we calculate the coupling constants with @xmath71 varied from 400 mev to 450 mev , we get the vector and tensor @xmath21 coupling constants as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the smallness of these coupling constants can be understood by comparing them with the @xmath89 coupling constants @xmath90 which were derived within the same framework .",
    "thus , the @xmath91 coupling constants are indeed very tiny , which is in agreement with the conclusion of recent experimental data  @xcite . using the value of @xmath7 .",
    "we immediately obtain the decay width of the @xmath8 as @xmath5 mev which is in qualitative agreement with the data of the diana collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants for the proton can be obtained easily by considering isospin factors .",
    "note that there is a sign difference in the coupling constants for the neutron and proton : @xmath92 and the same for the @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the decay width of the @xmath8 : @xmath94 mev , based on the experimental data for the @xmath95 coupling constant and @xmath96 where terms proportional to @xmath97 and @xmath98 were neglected .",
    "however , the coupling constant @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath99 , so that it is not possible to determine it by the @xmath100 only .",
    "thus , dpp  @xcite have taken the results from the @xmath22qsm calculations  @xcite . a recent work  @xcite uses the same formalism as refs .",
    "@xcite but several parts have been further elaborated .",
    "the symmetry - conserving quantization @xcite was established after the publication of ref .",
    "since then , many observables of the baryon octet have been recalculated .",
    "the quark densities of the axial - vector current were also calculated  @xcite and the ratio @xmath101 can be found to be @xmath102 .",
    "had dpp  @xcite used the ratio @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 , the decay width would have turned out to be @xmath105 mev , which is much smaller than the value @xmath106 mev published in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas @xmath107 would remain unchanged . even though we consider the criticism of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath103 , one will get the decay width of the @xmath23 which is also smaller than predicted in ref .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we draw the total cross sections for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 reactions with and without the @xmath33-exchange contribution , respectively , in the left and right panels .",
    "the @xmath33 exchange contributes to the total cross section for the neutron target by about @xmath115 whereas for the proton target it is almost everything .",
