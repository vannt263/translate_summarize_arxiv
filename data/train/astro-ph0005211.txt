    "1998 ) , and statistics and age considerations , these sources are likely to be young neutron stars under mass inflow from a remnant disk formed by fallback material from the supernova explosion ( chevalier , 1989 , lin , woosley & bodenheimer 1991 , mineshige , nomoto & shigeyama 1993 ) .",

    "the scenario of accretion from a remnant disk , preceded with a propeller phase , has been explored also by chatterjee , hernquist & narayan ( 1999 ) , who have employed specific thin disk evolution models for the time dependence of the mass inflow from the remnant disk , while marsden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have evaluated the supernova associations of axps and sgrs to argue that what unites these sources is their atypical snr environments rather than an intrinsic property of the neutron stars like superstrong magnetic fields . under the working hypothesis of the present work , that all supernovae form neutron stars with conventional @xmath12 10@xmath0 g magnetic fields , the differences between the dtns , axps and sgrs are due to their different mass inflow environments and histories . at the highest mass inflow rates we have the rqnss . these are propellers whose pulse periods are not observable because of accumulated circumstellar material that is optically thick to electron scattering .",

    "1993 ) we obtain the lower bound i@xmath39i@xmath40=10@xmath41 gm @xmath38 rad s@xmath6 .",
    "this lower bound is independent of the details of the glitch models and rests only on the assumption that the large glitches involve angular momentum exchange within the neutron star .",
    "further , as the mode of angular momentum transfer inside the star depends only on neutron star structure , the same parameter i@xmath42 would determine the energy dissipation rates in all neutron stars under external torques , also when the source of the external torque is not magnetic dipole radiation .",

    "is a possibility that has already been explored ( mereghetti & stella 1995 , van paradijs , taam & van den heuvel 1995 , ghosh , angelini & white 1995 ) and will be pursued below . in connection with the dtns",
    ", we note that a neutron star subject to mass inflow will experience high spindown rates even when the inflowing mass is not accreted , because of the star s centrifugal barrier ( the propeller effect ) ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "we propose that rxj 0720.4 - 3125 and the other dtns are neutron stars with magnetic fields of the order of 10@xmath0 g , spinning down under propeller torques .",
    "there is no accretion yet in the propeller phase .",
    "the luminosities of the dtns are produced by energy dissipation in the neutron star .",
    "these luminosities are dimmer , by several orders of magnitude , than the accretion luminosities that would have been produced if the mass inflow were accreted .",
    "the propeller torques depend on the magnetic moment of the neutron star and on the rate of mass inflow . using the spindown rates estimated from the energy dissipation luminosities together with order of magnitude expressions for propeller torques ,",
    "we show that the neutron star has a dipole magnetic field of the order of 10@xmath0 g. the estimated range of mass inflow rates coincides with the range of mass accretion rates inferred from the x - ray luminosities of the accreting axps and sgrs , suggesting that the dtns are in the propeller stage and the axps and sgrs in the accretion phase under similar mass inflow circumstances .",
    "occasional quiescent states of some x - ray transients are likely examples of the propeller phase ( cui et al 1997 , zhang et al 1998 , campana et al 1998 , menou et al .",
    "sources that are persistently in the propeller phase have not been detected previously .",
    "this is understandable since they are not lit up with an accretion luminosity .",
    "thus rxj 0720.4 - 3125 , rxj185635 - 3754 and other dtns are the first observed examples of propellers , observed only through their dissipation luminosities , only as the nearest members of the dtn class , and only by rosat , in view of their surface temperatures in the soft x - ray band .    in the propeller phase",
    "there is a spindown torque exerted on the neutron star , through the interaction of its magnetosphere with the ambient material .",
    "the order of magnitude of this spindown torque is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the magnetic moment of the neutron star with surface dipole magnetic field b and radius r , and @xmath49 is the alfven radius ( lipunov 1992 , frank , king & raine 1992 ) . here",
    "@xmath50 denotes the magnetic moment in units of 10@xmath51 g @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the mass inflow rate in units of 10@xmath11 gm s@xmath6 and m is the neutron star mass in solar mass units .",
    "the propeller phase will last until accretion starts when a critical rotation period is reached .",
    "this critical period is of the order of , but somewhat smaller than the equilibrium rotation period @xmath54 which obtains when the star s rotation rate equals the keplerean rotation rate of ambient matter at the alfven radius ; that is , when the corotation radius r@xmath55 = ( gm)@xmath56 becomes equal to r@xmath57 . in the propeller",
    "phase the source settles to an asymptotic spindown towards the equilibrium .",
    "a source is most likely to be observed during its asymptotic phase .",
    "since in the asymptotic regime r@xmath55 is close to r@xmath57 we can estimate the magnetic moment of a propeller from its spindown rate , and rotation rate , without knowing the mass inflow rate , simply by substituting r@xmath55 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath58 we take the dtn rxj0720.4 - 3125 , with p = 8.4 s , as our typical example ( haberl et al .",
    "the other dtn with a reported rotation period , rxj 0420.0 - 5022 , p = 22.7 s ( haberl , pietsch & motch 1999 ) , yields similar results . for rxj0720.4 - 3125",
    "we obtain @xmath59 using the bounds on the spindown rate , eq.(2 ) .",
    "thus if rxj0720.4 - 3125 is a propeller it has a conventional magnetic field , @xmath60 using eq.(6 ) and setting the observed period to be equal to the equilibrium period , we can now obtain bounds on the mass inflow rates : @xmath61 this yields @xmath62 for the mass inflow rate for rxj0720.4 - 3125 .",

    "for most dtns and for all rqnss , which , as we propose below , are also propeller candidates , we do not have observed rotation periods . for these sources , setting the rotation period to be equal to the equilibrium period , @xmath65 from eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) . with the range of @xmath66 obtained from dtn luminosities ( eqn .",
    "( 3 ) ) , @xmath67 is obtained for these dtns for @xmath50 = 1 .",
    "if the source of mass inflow is not depleted , the propeller phase is followed by an accretion phase starting at some critical period .",
    "the neutron star will continue to spin down , now as an accreting source , as its period evolves from the critical period towards the equilibrium period .",
    "similarity of the rotation periods of the axps with the 8.4 s period of the dtn rxj0720.4 - 3125 suggests that the approach to rotational equilibrium is an asymptotic process extending through the propeller phase on to the accretion phase .",
    "these sources are asymptotically close to their individual equilibrium rotation periods , which lie in a narrow range determined by their magnetic moments and mass inflow histories .",
    "the mass accretion rates inferred from the x - ray luminosities of the axps and sgrs all fall in the range @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic moments for accreting sources near rotational equilibrium are in the 10@xmath0 g range given the 5 - 15 s rotation periods : @xmath69    to summarize , ( i ) the spindown rates inferred for the dtn sources through the interpretation of their luminosities as due to energy dissipation ( eqs.(1)-(3 ) ) agree with the observed spindown rates for the axps and sgrs to order of magnitude .",
    "( ii ) estimates of the magnetic moment , from the spindown rates for the dtns as propellers close to rotational equilibrium , coincide in the same range as the magnetic moments inferred from the mass accretion rates implied by the x - ray luminosities of axps and sgrs as accretors asymptotically close to rotational equilibrium .",
    "this is the conventional 10@xmath0 g range of most young neutron stars observed as rotation powered pulsars and in high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "( iii ) furthermore , the mass inflow rates inferred for the dtns from the assumption that they are close to rotational equilibrium , agree with the accretion rates of the axps and sgrs .",
    "these observations strongly support the unifying hypothesis that the sources are related instances of asymptotic spindown near similar equilibrium periods .",
    "we now turn to a simple model for the asymptotic spindown . a neutron star in the presence of inflowing matter experiences both spindown and spin - up torques .",
    "the long term evolution is determined by the balance between these , described by a function @xmath70 ( ghosh & lamb 1991 ) which goes through zero when @xmath71 where @xmath72 is of order one , and @xmath73 . in accretion from a disk ,",
    "the relative specific angular momentum brought in by the accreting material to spin the neutron star up is @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "since the dimensional torque is @xmath75 , spindown near equilibrium can be modelled as @xmath76 where t@xmath77 = @xmath78 . here",
    "the zero of the torque ( the end of the spindown era ) is taken to be at @xmath79 rather than @xmath80 , for simplicity .",
    "the axps and sgrs must then be sources that have emerged from propeller spindown and started to accrete while still under a net spindown torque as they have not yet reached rotational equilibrium .",
    "another simplifying assumption we make is that the mass inflow rate is constant in each source . in a more realistic model the mass inflow rate should be time dependent , especially if its source is a remnant disk with a finite lifetime , rather than a binary companion .",
    "a decaying @xmath7 leads to a natural explanation for the prevalence of spindown in an accreting source : the equilibrium period increases as @xmath7 decreases , and the source will be spinning down as its period tracks the equilibrium period ( ghosh , angelini & white 1997 , chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 1999 ) , answering the criticism of accretion models raised by xi ( 1999 ) .",
    "chatterjee , hernquist & narayan ( 1999 ) have employed an @xmath7 decaying as a power law in time , corresponding to the viscous evolution of a thin disk ( mineshige , nomoto & shigeyama 1993 , canizzo et al 1997 ) .",
    "the actual situation warrants taking into account propeller boundary conditions .",
    "the propeller activity could probably support a thick disk or corona .",
    "it would also lead to a different characteristic time dependence of @xmath7 . here",
    "we take a constant @xmath7 to represent an average of the actual @xmath7(t ) .    even under constant mass inflow rate , the torque history must be more complicated . in x - ray binaries ,",
    "the occurrence of spindown and spinup torques of comparable magnitudes , and torque reversals on all timescales signals the importance of electromagnetic torques .",
    "the real torques could lead to initial power law decays of @xmath81 as a function of time .",

    ". this may be the reason why the numbers of axps and sgrs are much less than the number of dtns . by the same token , mass inflow rates @xmath97 3.2 @xmath1 10@xmath3 gm s@xmath6",
    "are not inferred : at lower mass inflow rates the duration of the propeller phase exceeds the lifetime of the mass inflow source .",
    "the rare axps and sgrs are thus the young objects born with conventional magnetic fields but in circumstances of large enough mass inflow towards the neutron star , so that the time t@xmath77 , which scales with @xmath98 , is short compared to the lifetime of the mass supply : these are the rare sources which have gone through the propeller phase in time to start accretion before the matter supply is depleted .",
    "the more common source is the dtn , in a propeller phase of duration 10@xmath19 yrs , surviving the disappearance of the supernova remnant .",
    "while it is reasonable to expect that the lifetime of the mass supply increases at the lower mass inflow rates , one needs a model of the disk evolution to make the comparison with the propeller spindown quantitative .",
    "if dtns are born at a rate comparable to the total supernova rate , then a significant fraction of snrs must leave the neutron star under conditions of low enough @xmath7 . if all axps are to be descendants of dtns , either the propeller phase lasts 1000 times longer than the axp accretion phase , or only 10@xmath99 of dtns turn into axps , according to the comparison of total numbers of these two types of sources in the galaxy . taking into account the evidence for possible association with supernova remnants , and",
    "the agreement between snr ages and the age estimates the asymptotic model , mass supply from a debris disk around a single neutron star seems to be the likely scenario , rather than mass supply from a binary companion .",
    "the sgrs are like the axps in their x - ray properties .",
    "both classes of sources are detectable throughout the galaxy , and their comparable numbers suggest the sgrs are also in the same rare or relatively short beginning accretor phase as the axps .",
    "the claimed associations of most sgrs with snrs are less certain than the axp - snr associations .",
    "unlike the axps the sgrs are located at the outskirts of their candidate snr associations .",
    "nevertheless these snrs are of the same atypical dense class as the snrs associated with the axps ( marsden et al 1999 ) .    for the sgrs",
    "the magnetar hypothesis is on a different , stronger footing than is the case for the axps , in that it provides the energy store and a detailed dyamical model for the soft gamma ray bursts .",
    "while the present work does not address the mechanisms of the gamma ray burst phenomenon , it is nevertheless intriguing that as wang and robertson ( 1985 ) have noted propellers ( and probably their descendants the early accretors ) can support relativistic particle luminosities and gamma ray production in the surrounding accumulated matter .",
    "the energy source could be sporadic accretion of accumulated circumstellar mass released through instabilities .",
    "the remnant disk scenarios were first recalled in connection with the problem of planet formation around pulsars ( lin , woosley & bodenheimer 1991 ) , and disk instabilities involving planet - like masses ( mineshige , nomoto & shigeyama 1993 ) are consistent with the luminosities of the sgrs .",
    "it may not be unreasonable to speculate that sgrs are also a class of neutron stars with conventional fields undergoing disk instabilities .",
    "why is it that the axps are observed as pulsars while the lmxbs are not ?",
    "the important single exception is the recently discovered source xte j1808 - 369 .",
    "the explanation for the rarity of lmxb pulsars has been that comptonization by circumstellar material will destroy pulses by washing out the beams emerging from the neutron star if the material is optically thick to electron scattering ( lamb et al . 1985 ) .",
    "this was noted in connection with the axps by ghosh , angelini & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "the present picture is consistent with this : the axps are observed as pulsars because they are in the beginning stages of accretion , and the corona around them does not have significant optical thickness @xmath100 1 to destroy the beaming .",
    "work in progress to test this hypothesis by modelling the axp spectra as unsaturated comptonization and estimating the optical thicknesses will be reported separately .",
    "the radio quiet neutron stars found in centers of the supernova remnants cas a , puppis a , rcw 103 and 296.5 + 10 ( chakrabarty et al . 2000 , gaensler , bock & stappers 2000 , petre , becker & winkler 1996 , gotthelf , petre & hwang , 1997 , gotthelf , petre & vasisht 1999 , mereghetti , bignami & caraveo 1996 , vasisht et al .",
    "1997 ) may be the propeller sources for which the cumulative effect of the mass inflow has indeed set up a corona of @xmath100 1 around the neutron star .",
    "the source properties are very similar .",
    "variability of the flux ( gotthelf , petre & vasisht 1999 ) favours accretion or propeller driven energy dissipation rather than the cooling luminosity of an isolated neutron star .",
    "the low luminosities , l@xmath101 10@xmath102 - 10@xmath103 erg s@xmath6 suggest that these sources are in the propeller phase .",
    "accretion would imply @xmath13 10@xmath104 - 10@xmath3 gm / s , which can accrete onto the neutron star only if the rotation period is longer than 50 s ( eq.(6 ) ) for b @xmath12 10 @xmath0 g. but then at these low accretion rates there is no reason that we should not see pulses at the rotation period .",
    "blackbody effective areas of 1 km@xmath105 also enhance the expectation of coherent pulsations at the rotation period from these sources while upper limits of 13% and 25% have been obtained for the rqnss in rcw103 and cas a respectively ( gotthelf , petre & vasisht 1999 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "2000 ) . taking the rqnss to be propeller sources with l@xmath106 = @xmath27 ,",
    "as we did for the dtns , leads to @xmath10710@xmath108 - 10@xmath109 rad s@xmath20 .",
    "since the rotation periods of the rqnss are not known , we use eq.(10 ) with b @xmath12 10 @xmath110 g , and obtain @xmath111 for the rqnss the mass inflow rates @xmath7 are indeed higher than those inferred for the dtns and axps , consistent with the proposal that the radio quiet neutron stars are the high @xmath7 end of our spectrum of neutron stars under mass inflow from remnant disks .",
    "model parameters for the rqns in cas a are displayed in table 1 .",
    "the luminosity is typical of the rqnss . as a propeller with luminosity arising from energy dissipation , taking @xmath112 3 @xmath113 10@xmath108 rad s@xmath20 with @xmath114 = 1 and",

    "p@xmath1171 s , corresponding to the high mass inflow rate . the unobserved periods of the rqnss are smaller than the observed range of periods of the axps and dtns .",
    "for both the dtns and the axps there will be another source of energy dissipation in the disk or circumstellar material , due to accretion down to @xmath84 : @xmath118 near rotational equilibrium , l(r@xmath119 ) = i@xmath120 , the power expended on the star by the spindown torque .",
    "for the axps this luminosity is smaller than the accretion luminosity by a factor @xmath121 noting that the mass inflow may not be all accreted even in the axps . for the dtns l(r@xmath119 ) is actually larger than the observed luminosity @xmath27 by a factor latexmath:[\\[l(r_a)/\\dot{e}_{diss } \\sim ( i \\omega |\\dot\\omega|)/ ( i_p \\omega    dissipated entirely at the boundary region , r @xmath12 r@xmath119 , the effective temperature is : @xmath123 if the disk temperature lies in the euv range this would be extremely difficult to detect , but being nearby sources , dtns with low neutral hydrogen column density might provide a chance of looking for a disk luminosity as a test of the present model . for the thin disk model employed by chatterjee ,",
    "hernquist & narayan ( 1999 ) calculations of the expected disk spectrum and lumionosity are reported by perna , hernquist & narayan ( 2000 ) . for t(r@xmath119 ) in the optical or ir , observational upper limits for disks around the axps ( coe and pightling 1998 , hulleman et al 1999 ) pose a problem for thin disk models .",
    "the upper limits allow thin disks with disk outer radii @xmath12 10@xmath124 cm , which requires a very young age , t @xmath12 100 yrs , in terms of the viscous evolution of an isolated thin disk .",
    "however several considerations suggest that the remnant disks may be consistent with the observational upper bounds .",
    "the propeller effect might well lead to boundary conditions that alter the disk evolution . the work done on the inflowing material by the propeller , at the rate i@xmath120 , may lift and sustain the material at distances much larger than r@xmath119 .",
    "the emerging radiation may have a lower effective temperature , from a larger effective area .",
    "the remnant disk may be a thick disk , and it may be enshrouded in a comptonizing corona , as we invoked above .",
    "modelling of remnant disks and circumstellar material with propeller boundary conditions , and future observations on the spectra of dtns , axps and radio quiet neutron stars will help to resolve these issues .",
    "a unified picture is proposed to account for all neutron stars formed in supernovae , and to include rqnss , dtns and axps and perhaps sgrs .",
    "the salient features of this picture are :    \\(i ) the signature of a young neutron star depends on the presence and nature of the mass inflow of fallback material from the supernova explosion .",
    "the related classes of sources represent different pathways under different mass inflow rates and histories .",
    "\\(iv ) the similarity in the rotation periods of these sources is not a coincidence but rather a consequence of the asymptotic approach to rotational equilibrium under a wide range of mass inflow rates .",
    "\\(v ) with low @xmath7 the spindown is too slow for the source to go through the propeller stage and reach the accretion stage before the circumstellar mass is depleted .",
    "these sources , observed as dtns , are propellers for as long as 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath19 yrs , and make up the most numerous class .",
    "\\(viii ) the observability of the rotation period in the axps but not in the lmxbs can be explained qualitatively in terms of comptonization as supported by an interpretation of their spectra .",
    "the rqnss are the young neutron stars for which comptonization washes out beaming so that the rotation period is not observable .",
    "\\(vi ) with low @xmath7 the spindown is too slow for the source to go through the propeller stage and reach the accretion stage before the circumstellar mass is depleted .",
    "these sources , observed as dtns , are propellers for as long as 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath19 yrs , and make up the most numerous class .",
    "arguments that axps and dtns are magnetars are based on the grounds that isolated neutron stars with ordinary 10@xmath0 g fields can not have spun down to @xmath12 10 s periods within the estimated ages .",
    "the above picture obviates the need to postulate magnetars for axps and dtns . for",
    "the sgrs the required energy budgets and dynamical arguments make a case for the magnetar hypothesis .",
    "marsden et al ( 1999 ) have noted that axps and sgrs share a common morphology of their associated supernova remnants , which they link with the high density of the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "these authors argue that the common properties of these classes of sources must therefore be due to a common set of environmental factors , rather than intrinsic neutron star properties like superstrong magnetic fields . whether the large spindown rates observed are due to spindown by interaction with ambient matter , as proposed here , as well as by chatterjee , hernquist & narayan ( 1999 ) and marsden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or to spindown by a magnetar can be decided by detailed analysis of the fluctuations ( noise ) in the spindown process , as the timing noise characteristic of accretion powered neutron stars is quite distinguishable from the timing noise in the typically much quieter isolated rotation powered pulsars .",
    "this analysis will require frequently sampled timing observations of the axps and sgrs . the recently reported extended quiet spindown phases in 1e2259 + 586 and 1rxs j170849.0 - 400910 ( kaspi , chakrabarty & steinberger 1999 ) is not sufficient to conclude that this source is undergoing spindown under magnetic dipole radiation since the quiet spindown phase was preceded by episodes of higher spindown rates with large timing noise strengths ( baykal & swank 1996 ) . whether such changes in the torque repeat periodically as foreseen for a precessing magnetar ( melatos 1999 ) remains to be checked in future timing observations . a well known accreting source , the lmxb 4u1626 - 67 , has exhibited similar quiet episodes as well as intervals of strong timing fluctuations that are typical of accreting sources ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "it is encouraging from the unified point of view of this work that during the quiet spindown epoch that would allow the dtection of glitches , 1e 2259 + 586 has indeed exhibited a glitch that is very similar to the glitches of the vela pulsar and other radio pulsars ( kaspi , lackey & chakrabarty 2000 ) .",
    "if the axps are confirmed as accreting sources , the glitch from 1e2259 + 586 will constitute strong support for our starting hypothesis that all neutron stars have the same internal dynamics and the associated energy dissipation rates .",
    "observation of a spindown rate in the expected range from rxj0720.4 - 3125 or periods and spindown rates from other dtns would constitute strong evidence for the propeller hypothesis .",
    "the framework proposed here leads to a program of related issues to be reported in subsequent work .",
    "these include models of the disk and circumstellar material , the emerging spectrum and pulse content , the time evolution of the mass inflow and the resulting spindown .",
