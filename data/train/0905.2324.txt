    "<S> we discuss several similarities and differences between the concepts of electric and magnetic dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the relation between the magnetic dipole and a current loop and show that in the limit of a pointlike circuit , their magnetic fields coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the presentation is accessible to undergraduate students with a knowledge of the basic ideas of classical electromagnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a magnetic dipole describes the long distance limit of the field produced by a steady current flowing in a small loop of wire.@xcite the word `` dipole '' is borrowed from electrostatics but when used in magnetostatics , this terminology is somewhat deceptive because a magnetic dipole is physically very different from its electric counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to discuss the similarities and differences of these concepts .    </S>",
    "<S> recall the definition of an electric dipole . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a configuration in which two charges @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the electric dipole is obtained by taking the limit @xmath5 keeping fixed the quantity @xmath6 which is called the _ electric dipole moment_. the dipole electric field @xmath7 can be obtained from the potential @xcite @xmath8 so that @xmath9    it might be tempting to define a magnetic dipole with moment @xmath10 in a similar way : that is , the object which generates the magnetic field @xmath11 however , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) is inconsistent with the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles , as described by the maxwell equation @xmath12 because @xmath13 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we used the result@xcite@xmath14    the failure to satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ due ] ) is not surprising because @xmath15 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> was constructed as the limit of zero separation between monopole and anti - monopole , which in the magnetic case do not exist .    a modification of eq .  ( [ 4 ] ) at the origin </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath16 fixes the problem and gives a divergenceless field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the field given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 7 ] ) is no longer conservative ( irrotational ) , in contrast to its electric counterpart , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between electric and magnetic fields is that , in a stationary situation , the electric field is conservative as a consequence of the faraday equation @xmath17 whereas the magnetic field , which is divergenceless , can not also be irrotational ( unless it is identically zero ) .    in a world without monopoles , a magnetic dipole must be defined in terms of current distributions only . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic effects of a steady current density @xmath18 are described by ampere s equation @xmath19 from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we can calculate the magnetic field @xmath20 provided the condition , @xmath21 which is equivalent to conservation of charge in the steady case , is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ uno ] ) shows that the non - conservative part of the magnetic field is located at the points at which the current density is nonzero .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore in the magnetic dipole case , eq .
