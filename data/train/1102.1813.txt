    "models of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type  @xcite have a long history and have been extensively used to describe the dynamics of lightest hadrons and the thermodynamic properties of excited matter ( see the review articles @xcite ) . in the `` classical '' versions such schematic models incorporate the chiral symmetry of two - flavor qcd and its spontaneous breakdown at temperatures below the critical one , @xmath1 .",
    "they offer a simple and practical illustration of the basic mechanisms that drive the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , a key feature of qcd in its low - temperature , low - density phase .",
    "however , in spite of their widespread use , the njl models suffer from the major shortcoming that the reduction to global color symmetry prevents quark confinement .    in the polyakov - loop - extended njl ( pnjl )",
    "model  @xcite@xcite , the quarks are coupled simultaneously to the chiral condensate , to be an order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking , and to a homogeneous gauge field representing polyakov loop dynamics , which serves as an order parameter for the transition from the low - temperature , symmetric , confined phase to the high - temperature , deconfined phase .",
    "the model has proven successful in reproducing lattice data on qcd thermodynamics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we confront general properties of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons as well as thermodynamics at finite temperature @xmath4 and baryon chemical potential @xmath5 calculated within the two - flavor njl model with those of the pnjl one .",
    "to describe the coupling between quarks and the chiral condensate in the scalar - pseudoscalar sectors , the two - flavor njl model  @xcite is used with the following lagrangian density @xmath6~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the coupling constant , @xmath8 is the vector of pauli matrices in flavor space , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the quark fields ( color and flavor indices are suppressed ) , @xmath11 is the diagonal matrix of the current quarks masses , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    the grand canonical thermodynamic potential can be obtained from this lagrangian in systematic approximations . in the mean - field approximation",

    "this corresponds to the following defintion of the physical pressure @xmath82    within the pnjl model with @xmath83 the reduced pressure and energy density exhibit reasonable behavior consistent with the recent lattice qcd results for the vanishing chemical potential  @xcite ( see fig .",

    "this was the reason to consider the thermodynamic functions for @xmath86 .",

    "are not only underestimated due to the missing gluon contribution , but also essentially shifted toward lower temperatures because of the lack of a confining mechanism for the dynamical quark degrees of freedom .    within njl - like models",
    "there are several characteristic temperatures .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 entering the effective potential ( [ ueff ] ) of the pnjl model has been noted above .",
    "three other scales are the pseudo - critical temperature for chiral crossover @xmath91 defined by the maximum of @xmath92 , the pseudo - critical temperature for the deconfinement crossover @xmath93 which can be found from the maximum of @xmath94 , and @xmath95 defined for pnjl model as the average of two transition temperatures @xmath91 and @xmath93  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath91 at large @xmath5 is higher than those for finite mass but both temperatures coincide when @xmath1040 for both the njl and pnjl models . for the case",
    "@xmath1050 both models show the critical end point at the temperature @xmath106 below which the chiral phase transition is of first order . at this point ( @xmath107 ) the phase transition changes from first order to crossover  @xcite . for the chirally symmetric case in the pnjl model the first order phase transition ends at a tricritical point above which , for @xmath108 , the chiral transition is of the second order . in the njl model",
    "@xcite the topology of the phase diagram is the same as in the pnjl case , only @xmath106 and @xmath109 are situated at higher temperatures . in accordance with other calculations , the temperature of the tricritical point is above that of the critical end point .    within the pnjl model",
    "the positions of critical points are @xmath110(95,320 ) and @xmath111(160,265 ) mev .",
    "these numbers are quite close to those in @xcite for the set with similar parameter values ( set b , the case i ) .",
    "one should emphasize that critical properties of observables are significantly influenced by the chosen parameter set and regularization procedure as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we have compared the thermodynamics of njl and pnjl models . in agreement with previous results , it is shown that the inclusion of coupling between chiral symmetry and deconfinement essentially improves the description of thermodynamic bulk properties of the medium .",

    "effects of the polyakov loop move the cep to higher @xmath4 and lower @xmath5 than in the njl case  @xcite .",
    "the position of the calculated cep in the @xmath101 plane is still far from the predictions of lattice qcd and empirical analysis .",
