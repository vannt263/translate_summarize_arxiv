    "the development of intense spallation neutron sources @xcite has made possible the measurement of neutron capture cross sections on submilligram samples @xcite .",
    "this is a necessary development for neutron cross section measurements of rare isotopes , especially radioactive isotopes .",
    "the new capabilities of these neutron sources are applicable to basic research on the nature of the neutron capture process , applied research in support of the accelerator transmutation of radioactive waste ( atw ) , research in support of nuclear astrophysics research , as well as other applications .",
    "the neutron energy range over which cross sections need to be measured for our specific applications is below 1 mev , where the capture cross sections are generally large , where the atw schemes often have large neutron fluxes , and where astrophysical nucleosynthesis takes place for producing s - process isotopes and in the later stages of the r and p processes .",
    "these applications make certain demands on the overall performance of the neutron time - of - flight spectrometer , including the @xmath2-ray detector array",
    ". the spectrometer must be able to make accurate measurements of neutron capture on small targets , e.g. submilligram , because the isotopes are inherently difficult to produce and in some cases have a very high specific radioactivity .",
    "high detector efficiency is desired for good counting statistics , for minimizing corrections for missed events , and for measuring the total energy emitted as @xmath2-rays . with good energy resolution and a well defined efficiency response function",
    ", true capture events can be distinguished from the random @xmath2-rays emitted from radioactive targets and from many sources of background capture events simply by demanding that the detected total energy of the gamma rays be equal to the q - value of the desired capture reaction plus the kinetic energy of the incident neutron .    of particular importance also is the sensitivity of the detector to neutrons , both those scattered from the target and target backing as well as background from other sources . with pulsed monoenergetic sources ,",
    "the background from neutrons scattered by the sample can often be separated cleanly from the capture @xmath2-ray events by time - of - flight ( tof ) techniques .",
    "even if the detector captures the scattered neutrons , these events come much later than @xmath2-rays from neutron capture on the sample .",
    "for example , the flight time of a 100 kev neutron over a 10 cm path is 22.9 ns , entirely adequate for distinguishing it from a capture @xmath2-ray .",
    "unfortunately , this technique can not be applied to neutron tof spectrometers with so - called `` white '' neutron sources because of the wide range in neutron energy ( subthermal to several hundred mev ) . with a white neutron source",
    ", scattered neutrons can arrive at the detector at the same time as capture @xmath3-rays from slower neutrons .",
    "a very instructive example of this has been given by guber et al . @xcite .",
    "the design must therefore compensate for this shortcoming in order to make measurements of the accuracy previously achieved with monoenergetic or nearly monoenergetic sources @xcite .    despite this disadvantage of white neutron sources , they have very strong advantages .",
    "resonance properties can be studied thoroughly as the neutron energy sweeps through the resonances ; the energy range is continuous from subthermal to well over 1 mev ; and techniques are well developed for measurements of neutron flux and various sources of backgrounds .",
    "white neutron sources are based on electron linear accelerators or medium or high energy proton accelerators , which produce neutrons by spallation reactions .",
    "although a proper comparison depends on many parameters , spallation sources typically have intensities greater than those of electron linacs by several orders of magnitude in the region below a few tens of kev .",
    "a comparison of the lansce spallation neutron source with those based on electron linacs has been given previously @xcite .",
    "a further advantage is that the `` gamma flash '' of electron linacs is significantly reduced in spallation sources , although the latter do produce a large flux of high energy ( up to several hundred mev ) neutrons .",
    "although present spallation sources , designed mostly for condensed matter research , have a worse time spread than electron linac sources , this is not an inherent limitation , and future sources @xcite could be designed to reduce this difference . because of the advantages of spallation neutron sources , we focus our discussion on them , although many characteristics of the detectors in our design would be useful also at other white neutron sources .    to effectively use the new capabilities of spallation neutron sources , new techniques and new detectors",
    "will be required . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the potential for a highly segmented array of baf@xmath1 detectors surrounding the sample in which the capture cross section is to be measured .",
    "this detector array is segmented so that it can handle the radiations from the radioactive decay which might have the intensity of a curie ( 3.7@xmath410@xmath5 bq ) or more .",
    "we prefer an array that acts as a calorimeter in the sense that the total @xmath2-ray energy from a capture event is measured ; this approach is very useful in separating capture events on the sample from those on other materials in the region .",
    "in this paper we first discuss the general requirements for a 4@xmath0 detector .",
    "we then compare the results of a geant simulation to the measured parameters of the karlsruhe 42-detector array to validate the calculational approach .",
    "finally , we apply geant to simulate a proposed 162-element baf@xmath1 array for use at the lansce spallation neutron source , and a similar array proposed for use at cern .",
    "other 4@xmath0 arrays of scintillators have been developed , e.g. for research in light and heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "originally , these detector arrays have relied on nai(tl ) or csi(tl or pure ) as the scintillation materials .",
    "our designs are based to a large extent on the geometries of those arrays . in neutron",
    "capture reaction studies , an array of 8 elements of baf@xmath1 was developed previously for use at lansce @xcite , and baf@xmath1 has been used also in single or small arrays with lower efficiency @xcite .",
    "the 4@xmath0 array of 42 detectors at karlsruhe @xcite in use with a low energy neutron source has proved to be extremely productive in the field of cross section measurements for nuclear astrophysics , and we base much of our design considerations on that instrument .    with the simulations reported here , we believe that greater confidence can be had in the choice of design of the new detector systems .",
    "the principle of using a 4@xmath0 detector with high @xmath2-ray efficiency and reasonably good resolution is a complete detection of the prompt @xmath2-ray cascade emitted in a capture reaction .",
    "this concept offers the advantage of obtaining a clear signature for capture events via the sum energy of @xmath2 cascades , which reflects the binding energy of the captured particle .",
    "provided that the detector is segmented into a sufficiently large number of independent modules , valuable additional information on event multiplicities and hit patterns can be obtained as well . accordingly",
    "true capture events can be reliably distinguished from @xmath2-backgrounds which are inherent to neutron experiments .    in this respect",
    "4@xmath0 arrays differ completely from the simpler approach based on the detection of single capture @xmath2-rays .",
    "this category uses detectors with @xmath2-ray efficiencies which are linearly increasing with @xmath2-energy .",
    "it includes moxon - rae type detectors @xcite , where this feature is approximated by a @xmath2-ray converter followed by a thin plastic scintillator , as well as the commonly used and confusingly named `` total energy '' detectors .",
    "the latter design is based on c@xmath6d@xmath6 or c@xmath6f@xmath6 liquid scintillators of typical 1 l volume , which allow the detection of capture events with @xmath720% efficiency but require an external weighting function for obtaining the linear relationship between @xmath2-ray energy and efficiency @xcite .",
    "these detectors , which are currently in use at electron linear accelerators @xcite , do not provide sufficient gamma - ray energy information to differentiate capture on the sample from capture of scattered neutrons on nearby materials .",
    "hence , corrections for the various backgrounds discussed below are much more difficult to determine .",
    "the main problem in using 4@xmath0 arrays results from their much larger detector volume and from the fact that the chemical composition of the inorganic scintillator may include isotopes with relatively large cross sections for neutron capture .",
    "this makes them much more sensitive to neutrons scattered by the sample . particularly for kev neutron energies , where scattering in the sample dominates over capture , subsequent capture of the scattered neutrons in the scintillator can increase the overall systematic uncertainty .",
    "these effects reduce the number of suitable scintillator materials .",
    "for example , nai and csi have to be excluded from this application because of the large iodine ( n,@xmath2 ) cross section .",
    "several suitable scintillators are listed in table[tab_scint ] , all being composed of low cross section materials .",
    ".characteristics of some scintillator materials [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     shields of 5 mm lead and especially of 20 mm gold influence significantly the @xmath2-ray resolution of the detector as shown for the detector response to @xmath8au@xmath9 cascades , in fig.[fig_degr ] .",
    "-shieldings on the @xmath8au@xmath9 spectrum .",
    "[ fig_degr ] ]    in spite of this degradation in energy resolution , the total efficiency for capture events is much less affected . in the ideal case",
    "considered , it drops from 100 % ( without shielding ) to 98.5 % for a 5 mm lead absorber .",
    "however , the massive gold shielding would result in a reduction to 54 % and would imply that the full energy peak disappears completely .",
    "but even in this extreme example the spectrum exhibits still enough events at high sum energies to allow for background discrimination .",
    "collimation of the neutron beam for high energy neutrons ( up to several hundred mev ) is much more difficult than collimation of lower energy neutrons . to investigate the problem of a beam halo produced by collimating the beam upstream of the sample",
    ", we assumed a beam core diameter of 30 mm ( umbra ) , a penumbra of 80 mm diameter and an umbra / penumbra ratio of 2 x 10@xmath10 .",
    "the umbra was assumed to cover a gold sample 30 mm in diameter with a thickness of 100 @xmath11g/@xmath12 for a total mass of 0.7 mg .",
    "the penumbra , after passing the sample position , was incident on the baf@xmath1 .",
    "even with this very small beam halo , the halo background was comparable to the neutron capture signal on the gold .",
    "good collimation of the spallation neutron beam is therefore of great importance .",
    "we have considered a 4@xmath0 array of baf@xmath1 scintillators as a detector for neutron cross section measurements at a spallation neutron source .",
    "many design options have been included in the monte carlo geant simulations .",
    "we find that this type of detector , which detects the total @xmath2-ray energy following the capture event , has significant advantages over other detectors in that capture on the sample can be differentiated from other events simply by the q - value of the reaction .",
    "the energy resolution of the array must be good to take advantage of this essential feature .",
    "factors that would worsen the resolution , such as incomplete energy collection or using only a fraction of the light ( such as just the fast component from baf@xmath1 crystals ) or interaction of the @xmath2-rays with components ( such as the beam pipe , neutron absorbers , and aluminum and teflon reflectors around the scintillators ) are quantified .",
    "if further discrimination against background is required , the hit patterns on highly segmented detectors can be used .",
    "effects of neutrons scattered from the sample can be significant , especially for those samples that have large scattering - to - capture ratios .",
    "the effects are particularly pronounced above 100 kev , where for most nuclei , the capture cross sections become quite small .",
    "although baf@xmath1 has a relatively small capture cross section , other scintillators such as cef@xmath13 and c@xmath6f@xmath6 can have even smaller cross sections , and their appropriateness for a given experiment should be kept in mind .",
    "segmentation of the baf@xmath1 was found to be a useful approach to identifying capture events from the sample and for discriminating against capture of scattered neutrons in the scintillator .",
    "the detector designed here has many attractive features not only for neutron capture experiments but also for the study of @xmath2-ray production in neutron- induced fission and neutron inelastic scattering .",
