    "nonlinear spatially inhomogeneous waveguides give rise to a number of effects which are of interest by themselves , and also find important applications in such diverse fields as optical _ dispersion - decreasing fibers _ ( ddf ) @xcite and natural waveguides for internal waves in the ocean with a shear - flow background @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand that most nontrivial effects take place in the vicinity of a critical point , where the waveguide s dispersion or nonlinear coefficient changes sign .",
    "the critical points corresponding to the wave propagation of the nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) type were classified earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the most interesting one is that at which the sign of the dispersion coefficient @xmath0 changes .",
    "however , unlike the case when the nonlinear coefficient in the corresponding nls equation changes its sign , this case is not amenable to a consistent analytical consideration , hence systematic numerical simulations are necessary .    in a very recent paper @xcite , the propagation of a wave pulse in this model was simulated for a situation when @xmath0 changes its sign , in a self - focussing medium , from anomalous ( admitting the existence of bright solitons ) to normal ( for which bright solitons do not exist ) .",
    "accordingly , disintegration of an initial soliton - like pulse into radiation wave fields was considered . despite the apparent simplicity of the process ,",
    "a number of quite nontrivial features were found and qualitatively explained , the most interesting one being a double - humped structure in the region of the normal dispersion .    for applications , particularly for those related to nonlinear optics of fibers and planar waveguides , especially relevant",
    "is the reverse process , i.e. , formation of a soliton from a wave pulse crossing into the anomalous - dispersion region from the normal - dispersion one .",
    "previously , this process was considered by one of the present authors in @xcite in a purely analytical approximation , based on a variational technique . as we will demonstrate in this work , the system of ordinary differential equations derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from the underlying variable - coefficient nls equation by means of the variational approximation , indeed provides for quite an accurate description of the pulse s dynamics in a parametric region where the approximation is relevant .",
    "nevertheless , most results to be reported in the present work were produced by systematic direct simulations of the nls equation .",
    "a modified nls equation , valid near the zero - dispersion point for the nonuniformly guided nonlinear wave propagation , was introduced in the previous works @xcite : @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the distance along the waveguide and the so - called reduced time ( see , e.g. , the derivation of the corresponding nonlinear schrdinger equation for optical fibers in the book @xcite ) , @xmath3 is the above - mentioned sign - changing variable dispersion coefficient , and @xmath4 is the third - order - dispersion ( tod ) coefficient which , generally , should be included in the case when the usual dispersion becomes very weak @xcite .    here",
    "we consider solutions to eq . for a model with a continuous piecewise - linear dispersion : @xmath5 which takes into regard saturation of the dispersion after it has changed sign .",
    "this particular configuration can be easily realized in experiments with ddf and , generally , adequately represents the situation that we aim to consider .",
    "we will consider the evolution ( for @xmath6 ) of a pulse represented by the following natural initial configuration , @xmath7 simulations demonstrate that the evolution of other smooth , _ unchirped _ initial pulses is very similar to that which is studied in detail below for the initial condition .",
    "if tod is negligible , eq . takes a simpler form , @xmath8 and the momentum @xmath9 these equations admit a lagrangian representation . in particular , for the simplified equation , the _ lagrangian density _",
    "is @xmath10    thus for zero tod and @xmath3 chosen as per eqs . and",
    ", the pulse evolution is governed by the equations    [ vnls ] @xmath11    the evolution can be characterized by the two parameters , amplitude @xmath12 and inverse size @xmath13 of the initial pulse , or , alternatively , by its conserved energy and initial `` mass '' .",
    "the `` mass '' , which is _ not _ a conserved quantity of the nls equation , is defined as @xmath14 for the initial condition , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "since dispersion is constant for @xmath17 , the system can be considered as an initial - value problem for the focussing nls equation , with the initial condition at @xmath18 .",
    "thus the asymptotic solution will consist of a finite number of solitons represented by the discrete spectrum , and dispersive radiation represented by the corresponding continuous spectrum .",
    "the number of solitons can be found via the inverse scattering transform for the nls equation by solving the zakharov - shabat ( zs ) eigenvalue problem . to this aim , we define @xmath19 assuming that @xmath20 decays as @xmath21",

    "the spectrum of the eigenvalue @xmath25 consists of its continuous part on the real axis and discrete eigenvalues , for which nontrivial solutions exist with functions @xmath24 and @xmath26 decaying exponentially as @xmath27 .",
    "the number of the discrete eigenvalues in the upper half - plane is then equal to the number of solitons that will evolve from the wave packet @xmath28 .",
    "these discrete eigenvalues , in general , have a nonzero imaginary part .    note that , for a symmetric @xmath29 , which is the case here , if @xmath25 is an eigenvalue , so also is @xmath30 .",
    "solitary purely imaginary eigenvalues then correspond to a single zero - velocity nls soliton , while multiple ones give rise to stationary _",
    "breathers_. if @xmath25 has a nonzero real part , then the pair @xmath31 corresponds to a pair of counter - propagating solitons having velocities of equal magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "thus , a two - stage process can be used to solve eqs . .",
    "firstly , eq . is integrated from @xmath32 to @xmath18 , using a standard pseudo - spectral in @xmath2 and fourth - order in @xmath33 numerical method to obtain @xmath28 at @xmath18 .",

    "between 9095% of the energy of the initial pulse is transmitted to the breather.,width=415 ]    within the framework of the zs eigenvalue problem , generic transitions that lead to the formation of a pair of counter - propagating solitons take place when two eigenvalues appear out of the continuous spectrum , such as occurs for the @xmath110 transition , or two imaginary eigenvalues collide and subsequently reshape into a pair of complex eigenvalues , which occurs for the @xmath111 transition .",
    "no evidence has previously been reported of a transition where a single imaginary eigenvalue splits into a pair of complex eigenvalues .",

    "this result appears counter - intuitive , as one would expect the number of solitons to monotonically increase with the energy .",
    "however , this transition can be explained by the influence of the pulse s chirp at @xmath18 .",
    "as @xmath98 is increased , the strength of the chirp increases too .",
    "thus , while for small values of @xmath98 the chirp may have little effect on the pulse and one soliton is able to form , for larger values of the energy the chirp becomes strong enough to split the single soliton into a pair of solitons @xcite .",
    "for even larger values of the chirp , this pair is destroyed .",
    "a possibility could be to split the two solitons into four moving ones ; however , because the mass at @xmath18 is not sufficient to form four solitons , the pulse decays into radiation .",
    "in this section , we consider solutions to eq . , supplemented by eqs . and , under the assumption that @xmath4 is small ( @xmath117 ) but finite .",
    "therefore , the pulse evolution is now governed by the system    [ vmnls ] @xmath118    for @xmath17 , we are again dealing with a constant - coefficient equation , which is , however , no longer integrable ( note that this equation , with both constant and periodically modulated coefficient in front of the usual dispersion term , has attracted a lot of attention in nonlinear fiber optics , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , only direct numerical simulations can be used to obtain the solutions .    in the consideration of the transition from the anomalous to normal dispersion ( i.e. , focussing to defocussing ) , which was the subject of ref .",
    "@xcite , the pulse width achieved a minimum at the zero - dispersion point @xmath119 , and consequently tod was becoming more important as this point was approached .",
    "however , in the present case the pulse width achieves a _ maximum _ at @xmath119 and , in general , a minimum near @xmath18 .",
    "thus , due to the the underlying assumption @xmath120 , it would not be expected that tod would be significant until well into the focussing ( anomalous - dispersion ) region .",
    "hence the effect of tod on the pulse can be estimated by comparing the magnitude of the two constant - coefficient dispersion terms . if the pulse width is @xmath121 , then @xmath122 from figs .",
    " it is apparent that , for all the cases , @xmath123 , therefore tod can be neglected if @xmath124    when tod is taken into regard , it manifests itself in three ways .",
    "firstly , tod destroys the symmetry of the pulse .",
    "this is most dramatically seen if one considers the effect of tod on the radiative solutions , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] for a small value of the tod coefficient , @xmath125 . in the defocussing ( normal - dispersion ) region ( @xmath126 ) ,",
    "it is apparent that tod has little effect .",

    "[ radsoln ] , it is apparent that , nevertheless , the effect of tod far away from the zero - dispersion point does not change the radiative type of the solution .     for the solution of eq . with @xmath76 , @xmath105 and @xmath128 , demonstrating the effect of the third - order dispersion on the radiative solution which was shown , for the @xmath129 case , in fig .",
    "[ radsoln].,width=415 ]    the second effect of tod , which is now well known , is that solitons are no longer localized , but rather generate a small - amplitude co - propagating oscillatory tail ( such nonlocal solitary waves have been termed `` nanopterons '' by boyd @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we consider in detail the self - trapping of a soliton from a wave pulse that passes from a defocussing region into a focussing one in a spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear waveguide , described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation in which the dispersion coefficient changes its sign from normal to anomalous . </S>",
    "<S> the model has direct applications to _ dispersion - decreasing _ nonlinear optical fibers , and to natural waveguides for internal waves in the ocean . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , depending on the ( conserved ) energy and ( nonconserved )  mass \" of the initial pulse , four qualitatively different outcomes of the pulse transformation are possible : decay into radiation ; self - trapping into a single soliton ; formation of a breather ; and formation of a pair of counterpropagating solitons . </S>",
    "<S> a corresponding chart is drawn on a parametric plane , which demonstrates some unexpected features . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is found that any kind of soliton(s ) ( including the breather and counterpropagating pair ) eventually decays into pure radiation with the increase of the energy , the initial  mass \" being kept constant . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noteworthy that a virtually direct transition from a single soliton into a pair of symmetric counterpropagating ones seems possible . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation for these features is proposed . in two cases </S>",
    "<S> when analytical approximations apply , viz . , a simple perturbation theory for broad initial pulses , or the variational approximation for narrow ones , comparison with the direct simulations shows reasonable agreement . </S>"
