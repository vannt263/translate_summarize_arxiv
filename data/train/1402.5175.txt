    "<S> predicting , observing and characterizing this transition has been an experimental and theoretical goal since the 1980 s . </S>",

    "<S> the importance of the @xmath5 chiral symmetry of qcd for the phase transition has motivated the widespread use of staggered fermions in lattice studies of qcd thermodynamics because this formulation possesses one exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing , broken only by the quark mass . however , the flavor symmetry of the staggered fermion formulation is complicated showing an @xmath13 `` taste '' symmetry that is broken by lattice artifacts and made to resemble the physical @xmath5 symmetry by taking the square root of the dirac determinant , a procedure believed to have a correct but subtle continuum limit for non - zero quark masses .    because of these limitations , it is important to study these phenomena using a different fermion formulation , ideally one which supports the full @xmath5 chiral symmetry of qcd at finite lattice spacing . </S>",

    "<S> the good agreement with experiment for @xmath21 and @xmath22 computed at our largest lattice spacing and a comparison of zero temperature results at our @xmath23 lattice spacing with results from two smaller lattice spacings  @xcite , suggest discretization errors of @xmath24 in our results . in contrast , the less costly staggered fermion calculations are performed using @xmath1 , 10 , 12 and 16 . </S>",
