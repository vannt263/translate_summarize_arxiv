    "bipolar outflows and highly collimated jets are nearly ubiquitous features associated with stellar mass loss . from young stellar objects ( ysos ) to luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) - the stellar cradle to the grave - there exists clear evidence for collimated gaseous flows in the form of narrow high velocity streams or extended bipolar lobes ( fig 1.1 ) . in ysos ,",
    "lbvs and pne these collimated hypersonic outflows are observed to transport prodigious amounts of energy and momentum from their central stars - enough to constitute a significant fraction of the budgets for the entire system .",
    "thus outflows and jets are likely to play a significant role in the evolution of their parent stars .",
    "it is remarkable that such different objects , separated by billions of years of evolution and decades of solar mass , should drive phenomena so similar .",
    "the similarity of jets and bipolar outflows across the h - r diagram must tell us something fundamental and quite general about the nature of stellar evolution as well as the interaction of stars with their environments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review our current understanding of bipolar outflows . as we will see there is a unique synergy between theory and observations in this field providing a window into fundamental processes such as shocks , instabilities , ionization dynamics and chemistry .",
    "these systems are , however , more than astrophysical laboratories .",
    "the tension between an extensive multi - wavelength database and increasingly sophisticated theoretical tools allows bipolar outflows to act as an archimedean lever yielding insights directly into the birth and death of stars .",
    "bipolar outflows consitute an exciting field of study with rapidly expanding frontiers .",
    "the goal of this review is to act as a tutorial in bipolar outflow studies as well as focusing attention on particularly pressing unanswered questions .",
    "remarkable progress in understanding bipolar outflows has been achieved in the last two decades .",
    "observationally , the triad of morphologic , kinematic and spectroscopic studies have provided detailed portraits of bipolar outflows both individually and as a class of astrophysical object .",
    "morphological studies using both the hst and ground based instruments reveal bipolar outflows assuming a wide variety of large scale ( @xmath1 ) _ global _ configurations .",
    "spherical and elliptical outflows are observed in evolved systems such as pne , wolf - rayet nebulae and lbvs ( schwarz 1992 ; marstson 1994 ; nota 1995 ) .",
    "true bipolar outflows , which appear as two opposing lobes joined at narrow waist ( centered on the star ) occur in both young and evolved systems .",
    "the bipolar lobes exhibit different degrees of collimation ranging from wide figure * 8 * shapes to long , narrow jets . fig 1.2 shows a sample of pne and underscores the extraordinary diversity of outflow shapes .",
    "the appearence of _ point symmetry _",
    ", where all features are reflected across a central point as in an * s * ( ngc 5307 , fig 1.2 lower right ) , is a particularly intriguing feature to emerge from recent observations .",
    "morphological studies also reveal an array of small scale features ( @xmath2 ) which go by a variety of suggestive labels : ansae , knots , arcs , and cometary globules ( balick 1994 , odell & handron 1996 ) .",
    "kinematical studies of bipolar outflows ( using long slit echelle or fabret - perot observations ) reveal flow patterns that simultaneously possess high degrees of symmetry and complexity ( bryce 1997 ) .",
    "the most important point for this review is the clear presence of _ globally axisymmetric expansion patterns _ ( corradi & schwartz 1992b , lada & fitch 1996 ) .",
    "the velocities of the bipolar lobes are larger than local sound speeds indicating that outflow physics will be dominated by processes inherent to hypersonic shock waves .",
    "spectroscopic studies of line emission provide detailed snapshots of the microphysical state in the outflows .",
    "ionization of the lobes can occur in different ways .",
    "low mass young stars are too cool to produce significant ionizing flux so bipolar outflows associated with these stars can only be collisionally ionized by shocks .",
    "outflows from evolved stars and those associated with high mass young stars are , however , often photoionized by strong stellar uv fluxes . in addition to ions , most classes of bipolar outflow show some evidence for the presence of molecules and molecular chemistry ( latter 1995 , bachiller & gutierez 1997 ) .",
    "when spectroscopic studies of ionic and molecular transitions are coupled with shock emission / photoionization models , physical conditions in the outflows ( density , temperature , ionization and molecular fractions ) can be determined ( hartigan , morse & raymond 1993 , balick 1994 , dopita 1997 ) .",
    "rapid progress has also been made in the theory of bipolar outflows .",
    "analytical and numerical studies have recovered many of the observed features of outflows through what we will call the generalized wind blown bubble ( gwbb ) paradigm . in this scenario",
    "a fast wind from the central source expands into a strongly aspherical ( toroidal ) environment .",
    "the interaction of the wind and environment produces an expanding bubble bounded by strong shocks .",
    "the bubble s velocity is highest in the direction of lowest density . thus it is the density gradient in the environment which establishes a preferred axis for the bipolar lobes .",
    "we will explore this mechanism in considerable detail in section 2.2 and 2.3 .",
    "here we simply emphasize that this theoretical picture has been remarkably successful at explaining the properties of bipolar outflows in evolved stars .",
    "it has also found some success in explaining the properties of bipolar outflows in ysos but there the issues are more complex .",
    "one aspect of ysos which muddies the waters is the presence of both highly collimated jets and wider bipolar molecular outflows .",
    "the gwbb model provides a robust means of collimating jets ( discussed in section 2.4 and 2.5 ) and may , therefore , be relevant to both the manifestations of outflows in ysos .",
    "the gwbb paradigm has been applied to almost all forms of bipolar outflows .",
    "models which include both hydrodynamics and microphysics have been able to recover the global morphology , kinematics and ionization patterns in many pne ( frank & mellema 1994b ) and sn87a ( martin & arnett 1995 ) .",
    "strong correspondences also exist between gwbb models and the shapes and kinematics of wr nebulae ( garcia - seguria & maclow 1993 ) , lbvs like @xmath0 carinia ( frank , balick & davidson 1995 ) and symbiotic stars like r aquarii ( henny & dyson 1992 ) . in section 3",
    "we will discuss the applications of the gwbb theory in more detail including its relevance to ysos .",
    "the gwbb scenario has enjoyed enough success in describing outflows from evolved stars that , in this regime at least , one can speak of a _ classical _ gwbb model .",
    "numerous variations on its basic theme have been already explored . in an observational science familiarity",
    "can breed contempt and the limits of the gwbb scenario are already being revealed .",
    "new observational aspects of evolved star bipolar outflows such as point - symmetry have been discovered which the gwbb scenario may have difficulty recovering .",
    "models invoking mhd processes have been proposed which may be capable of addressing these issues better than the gwbb model ( chevalier & luo 1994 ) .",
    "we will discuss these models in section 2.8 .",
    "mhd processes are also believed to produce yso jets via accretion disks .",
    "these models may be relevant for pne ( soker & livio 1994 ) but may not be as useful for lbvs , wr bubbles and sn87a - type outflows ( cf washimi 1996 ) .      while bipolar outflows offer an unparalleled view into many important physical processes the ultimate purpose of their study is to understand stellar evolution .",
    "the details of stellar birth and death are often hidden from view , shrouded behind dense dusty circumstellar veils .",
    "bipolar outflows and jets are , on the other hand , easily observed and have dynamical ages long enough to span important evolutionary transitions in the life of a star . thus , bipolar outflows contain a `` fossil '' record of the central star s history .",
    "the simultaneous development of high resolution observational tools and detailed numerical models has allowed unprecedented contact between theory and reality in bipolar outflow studies .",
    "thus there exists the possibility of reading the history of an individual star or class of stars from the outflows .",
    "this is the most exciting aspect of bipolar outflow studies however currently it remains in its infancy . in section 4",
    "we will consider what is required to build accurate stellar wind paleontological investigations .",
    "a note on definitions is warranted before we venture any further . in what follows",
    "we explore bipolar outflows primarily as a _ hydrodynamic _ phenomena . while we focus on jets and jet collimation we approach this issue in the context of the collimation of bipolar outflows as a whole .",
    "i am , therefore , interested in systems in which both jets and bipolar outflows arise and examine the question : can both these outflow phenomena be driven by the same underlying hydrodynamic collimation process .",
    "there are a number of excellent reviews of mhd collimation of jets ( pudritz 1991 , shu 1997 ) . here",
    ", however , the focus is first on bipolar outflows and second on jets .",
    "thus i will not address the relativistic beams associated with neutron stars and black holes .",
    "it is quite possible that the hydrodynamic mechanisms discussed in this review will have some relevance to those systems as well ( eulderink & mellema 1994 ) .",
    "in this section we review the basic theory of bipolar wind blown bubbles ( wbbs ) .",
    "we begin with a star embedded in some form of unmagnetized ambient medium .",
    "the star produces a strong wind which expands into the ambient gas . to follow the interaction of the wind and ambient material we must model a multi - dimensional , time - dependent gaseous flow .",
    "we should include heating and cooling of the gas due to radiation .",
    "a proper treatment of energy source terms requires calculation of the microphysical state ( ionization , chemistry , level populations ) .",
    "thus a complete solution of the bipolar wbb problem requires solving the radiation - gasdynamic equations , the euler equations , coupled to radiation transfer and microphysical rate equations . in what follows",
    "we will not write expressions for the transfer of radiation or the rate equations for chemistry , ionization and level populations .",
    "the form of these equations depends too strongly on assumptions made in each environment .",
    "instead we have used an asterisk to denote those terms which depend on the radiation field and/or microphysical state ( schmidt - voight & koeppen 1984 , frank & mellma 1994a , suttner 1997 ) .",
    "the euler equations take the form ( shu 1994 )    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    where    @xmath6    and    @xmath7    in the above equations @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the density , velocity , pressure , temperature and energy density respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the mean mass per particle and @xmath11 is the ratio of specfic heats . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the volumetric heating and cooling rates .",
    "we have also ignored processes involving heat conduction , radiation pressure on grains and molecular and turbulent viscosity .",
    "these process may or may not be important depending on the environment ( soker 1994 ) .",
    "we first consider spherical wind blown bubbles to clarify basic dynamical issues .",
    "when both the wind and the ambient medium are isotropic the euler equations reduce to a system of pdes in time and one spacial dimensional ( spherical radius @xmath14 ) . in",
    "what follows i borrow liberally from a number of excellent treatments of spherical wbb theory ( pikelner 1968 , dyson & de vries 1972 , weaver 1977 , kwok 1978 , dyson & williams 1981 , kahn 1983 , koo & mckee 1992 )    when a stellar wind `` turns on '' it initially expands ballistically until enough ambient material is swept up for significant momentum to be exchanged between the two fluids .",
    "a triplet of hydrodynamic discontinuities then forms defining an `` interaction region '' bounded internally ( externally ) by undisturbed wind ( ambient ) gas .",
    "one can imagine the interaction region as a spherical shock wave layer cake . at the outer boundary",
    "is an outward facing shock .",
    "it accelerates , compresses and heats ambient material as it propagates .",
    "we refer to this feature as the _ ambient shock _ and denote its position as @xmath15 .",
    "the inner boundary is defined by an inward facing shock which decelerates , compresses and heats the stellar wind .",
    "we refer to this feature as the _ wind shock_. its position is @xmath16 . a _ contact discontinuity _ ( cd ) , @xmath17 , separates the shocked wind and shocked ambient material . in the 1 dimensional ( 1-d ) bubble these discontinuities form a sequence in radius : @xmath18 ( fig 2.1 ) .",
    "the compressed gas behind either or both shocks will emit strongly in optical , uv and ir wavelengths producing a bright shell which defines the observable `` bubble '' .",
    "the dynamics of the bubble and its emission characteristics are defined by the strength of post - shock shock cooling .",
    "here we consider radiative processes due to collisional excitation to be the dominant cooling processes . behind each shock",
    "we can define a cooling timescale @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the thermal energy density of the gas .",
    "to first order , radiative heating , often from a stellar radiation field , contributes only by establishing a `` floor '' in the temperature .",
    "we therefore ignore heating in what follows .",
    "radiative cooling can be expressed in terms of a cooling curve : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of the gas and function @xmath23 is a sum over many radiative processes emitting a variety of wavelengths .",
    "the bubble has both cooling and dynamical timescales defined as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the speed of the ambient shock and we have assumed ( as we shall throughout this paper ) that @xmath26 .",
    "comparison of @xmath27 and @xmath28 separates wbbs into two classes : radiative ( also known as momentum conserving ) and adiabatic ( a.k.a .",
    "energy conserving ) .",
    "understanding bubble dynamics requires considering each shock separately . if @xmath29 then the gas behind a shock does not have time to cool before the bubble evolves appreciatively .",
    "if cooling is weak the gas retains thermal energy gained after passing through the shock transition and we refer to shock as _ adiabatic_. shu ( 1994 ) has correctly pointed out that a better term would be _ non - radiative _ since energy not entropy is the issue .",
    "we will bend to convention , however , and continue using the label adiabatic .",
    "high pressure behind an adiabatic shock limits the post shock gas compression ( @xmath30 . in some cases this can lead to a large separation between the shock and the cd .",
    "if @xmath31 then the gas cools quickly relative to the bubble s growth . in this case",
    "the shock is _ radiative_. the loss of thermal energy behind a radiative shock means the loss of pressure support as well .",
    "the shock collapses back towards the contact discontinuity ( in a frame moving with the shock ) producing a thin dense shell .",
    "there is no intrinsic limit to the post shock compression behind a non - magnetized radiative shock ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) .    in almost all cases of interest in this review the densities in the ambient medium",
    "are high enough to ensure that a wbb s ambient shock will be radiative .",
    "thus @xmath32 and the bubble will have a thin outer shell .",
    "the properties of the wind , and the wind shock , can however vary appreciatively from one application to another .",
    "the nature of wind shock will depend upon the wind s speed @xmath33 and mass loss rate @xmath34 .",
    "the density in a steady wind takes the form    @xmath35    thus winds with high @xmath33 and low @xmath36 are tenuous .",
    "since @xmath37 the cooling timescale for shocked wind material can be quite long . in addition , winds with high @xmath33 produce high post - shock temperatures .",
    "if the wind shock expands slowly then @xmath38 in the wind s reference frame .",
    "the post - shock temperature is then    @xmath39    which further extends the cooling time .",
    "when @xmath40 for material behind the wind shock , the bubble interior fills with hot gas .",
    "thus an adiabatic wind shock produces an _ energy conserving bubble_. we note that in the literature the terms energy conserving bubble and adiabatic bubble are often used interchangeably . in the co - moving frame of the cd",
    "the wind shock is pushed back towards the star , @xmath41 . in energy conserving bubbles it is the thermal energy ( pressure ) of the shocked wind which drives the expansion of the bubble as a whole .",
    "the region between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is often refered to as `` the hot bubble '' .    in the other extreme",
    "the shocked gas can cool effectively and the wind shock collapses onto the contact discontinuity , @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the bubble consists a double layered thin shell .",
    "the expansion is now driven directly by the ram pressure of the stellar wind @xmath43 and the bubble is referred to as momentum conserving or radiative .    the expansion speed of energy conserving ( adiabatic ) and momentum conserving ( radiative ) bubbles can be easily determined .",
    "we begin with a spherically symmetric environment characterized as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a constant determined by the parameters of the environment . in a uniform environment ( @xmath46 ) @xmath45 is the actual density ( koo & mckee 1992 ) .",
    "for an environment created by a previously deposited wind , ( @xmath47 ) @xmath45 is proportional to the mass loss rate in the wind divided by the wind speed ( equation [ r2law ] ) . from dimensional arguments alone",
    "( shore 1995 ) it is easy to show that an energy conserving bubble driven by a stellar wind with mechanical luminosity @xmath48 expands as    @xmath49    one can also show that a momentum conserving bubble driven by a stellar wind with momentum input @xmath50 expands as    @xmath51    notice that @xmath15 increases more rapidly for the energy conserving bubble .",
    "thus the energy lost to radiation in the momentum conserving case strongly effects bubble dynamics .",
    "we will see this again when we consider bipolar bubbles .    when the bubble is radiative , the wind and ambient shocks lie close to each other and they expand with the same speed . in the adiabatic case",
    "the wind shock expands more slowly .",
    "the wind shock s location is determined by the balance of wind ram pressure and hot bubble thermal pressure .",
    "dimensional arguments can again be employed to find the expansion speed of the wind shock    @xmath52    koo & mckee 1992 have shown that wbbs can evolve through a sequence of configurations from fully radiative to fully adiabatic .",
    "most bubbles of interest in this review begin in the radiative regime .",
    "as the bubble expands the density of the wind at @xmath16 becomes low enough to push @xmath29 .",
    "instead of making a direct transition to an energy conserving bubble , koo & mckee 1992 conjectured that another evolutionary state lay between the adiabatic and radiative configuration which they called the partially radiative bubble ( prb ) . in a prb",
    "the cooling time for the gas is shorter than the age of the bubble but longer than the time it takes for the unshocked wind to reach the wind shock i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 . in the prb stage",
    "most of the shocked wind will have cooled but material which has recently passed through the shock will remain hot enough to keep @xmath55 ( fig 2.1 ) . while the existence of prb s has yet to be confirmed in numerical simulations , koo & mckee s paper",
    "is highly recommended as it provides a clear analytic map of the cooling and dynamical evolution in spherical wbbs .",
    "the wbb paradigm can be extended to embrace elliptical and bipolar nebulae by generalizing the model to include an aspherical environmental density distribution @xmath56 .",
    "we imagine that @xmath57 describes a toroidal density distribution with a equator to pole density contrast defined as @xmath58 .",
    "we always take @xmath59 . in what follows we consider axisymmetric bubbles ( @xmath60 dimensions or 2.5-d ) . when an isotropic stellar wind encounters the gaseous toroid _ inertial gradients _ ( as opposed to pressure ) allows the ambient shock to expand more rapidly along the poles ( fig 2.2 ) . to see the dominant role of inertia consider an isothermal toroidal ambient medium .",
    "the highest pressures in environment are achieved in the equator where @xmath61 .",
    "the temperature in the environment will , in general , be low ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus the pressure at the equator will always be orders of magnitude lower than the driving ram pressure or thermal pressure achieved in the hot bubble with @xmath63 .",
    "only the inertia of the ambient medium will affect the shape of the bubble .",
    "in his study of energy conserving gwbb dynamics ( in the context of interacting stellar winds ) icke ( 1988 ) derived an expression for the evolution of the ambient shock geometry @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65    where the above expression comes from kompaneets ( 1960 ) formalism and    @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 describes the angular variation of the ambient density .",
    "equation [ komp ] shows that @xmath68 can be defined as a local acceleration parameter for the ambient shock .",
    "therefore the run of @xmath69 determines the asphericity of the bubble .",
    "the kompaneets approximation assumes that the hot bubble is _ isobaric _",
    ", i.e. @xmath70 is constant in the region between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the angular variation of density ( inertia ) in the ambient medium , @xmath67 , determines the angular dependence of @xmath71 and , therefore , the shape of the bubble .",
    "in general , analytical determination of the properties of aspherical wbbs is difficult .",
    "the problem involves partial differential equations which must be solved in two spatial dimensions and time .",
    "dyson ( 1977 ) and kahn & west ( 1985 ) provided the analytical solutions for bipolar energy conserving nebula using the gwbb paradigm .",
    "icke s 1988 investigation explored a wider range of solutions demonstrating that strongly collimated solutions for @xmath72 could be generated if the torus had a narrow opening angle . in a study of r aquarii ,",
    "henny & dyson ( 1992 ) used a model based on momentum conservation in the shell and included emission characteristics of the bubble for both shock excited and photo - ionized emission . working off a novel method proposed by giuliani ( 1982 ) ,",
    "dwarkadas , chevalier and blondin ( 1996 ) produced similarity solutions for bipolar wbbs .",
    "these solutions were quite powerful in that they predicted not only the shape of the bubble , but also the mass motions along the shell of swept up ambient gas .",
    "tangential motions along the shell can lead to substantial modifications of shell density ( kahn & west 1985 , wang & mazzali 1992 )    any study of the gwbb formalism must include specification of the ambient density distribution .",
    "the physics which generates asphericity in the environment will depend on the application and we will discuss specific mechanisms in more detail in section 3.6 . here",
    "we note that most investigations have used ad - hoc seperable functions to control the ambient density distribution @xmath73 .",
    "three examples which have been used extensively in the literature are the icke , inverse icke and luo & mccray functions ( icke , balick & preston 1989 , luo & mccray 1991 , dwarkadas , chevalier and blondin 1996 ) .",
    "these take the form    @xmath74^{-1 }   \\label{ad1}\\ ] ]    @xmath75   \\label{ad2}\\ ] ]    @xmath76    the parameter @xmath77 controls the pole to equator density contrast ( which in turn defines @xmath78 ) while @xmath79 controls the steepness of the turnover from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "there is no physics inherent to eqs [ ad1 ] - [ ad3 ] .",
    "they are simply useful for controlling the shape of the ambient medium .",
    "more recent studies ( garcia - segura 1997 , collins 1998 ) have attempted to incorporate specific physical models for the creation of the toroidal environment into gwbb calculations .",
    "this is one of the most important paths for future research efforts to follow .      in this section",
    "we will consider multi - dimensional numerical models of wbbs .",
    "the inherent complexity of the gwbb problem make simulations a necessary tool for explicating the true range of hydrodynamic flow patterns possible in these systems .",
    "the evolution of 2.5-d bipolar outflows under the gwbb scenario has now been well studied with computer models .",
    "we note that 1-d spherically symmetric numerical models that have also been extensively explored .",
    "these models have reached a fairly high degree of sophistication in terms of their treatments of both hydrodynamics and microphysical processes .",
    "the interested reader should consult the following references ( schmidt - voight & koeppen , 1987 ; marten & schoneberner 1991 ; frank 1994 ; mellema 1994 ; arthur , henny & dyson 1996 )    the first and most frequent application of numerical gwbb models has been to pne . in this section",
    "we focus on these studies since pne constitute the archetypical interacting stellar wind bipolar bubble . in pne",
    "the ambient density distribution is assumed to form from a slow , ( @xmath82 ) , dense , ( @xmath83 ) , wind expelled when the central star was on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , @xmath84 in equation [ amden ] ) .",
    "the stellar wind has a high velocity , ( @xmath85 ) , and low mass loss rate , ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "soker & livio ( 1989 ) were the first to explore the time - dependent evolution of bipolar pne with the gwbb formalism .",
    "they confirmed the ability of the paradigm to produce bipolar bubbles in time - dependent calculations . using higher order methods and higher resolution grids mellema , eulderink & icke ( 1991 ) and icke , balick & frank ( 1992 ) explored the hydrodynamic flow pattern in bipolar wind",
    "blown bubbles in more detail .",
    "their results provided a more extensive mapping of parameter space articulating the dynamics of the ambient / wind shocks in greater detail .",
    "the formation of highly collimated jets in the hot bubble was one of the most surprising results of these simulations . while it is now recognized that pne are also jet - bearing systems ( livio & soker 1994 ) these simulations showed how jets could effectively form within pne wbbs ( rozyczka & tenorio - tagle 1985 ) .",
    "we will address the issue of jet collimation again in the following sections .",
    "radiative losses were not included in the simulations cited above .",
    "thus both the wind and ambient shocks were adiabatic .",
    "given the high wind speeds this was appropriate only for the wind shock .",
    "in addition , without radiative losses these simulations could not be directly compared with observations . in a series of papers by frank & mellema ( frank & mellema 1994a , frank & mellema 1994b , mellema & frank 1995 , mellema 1995 )",
    "a numerical code was developed which included hydrodynamics , microphysics and radiation transfer from the hot central star .",
    "these models tracked cooling and emission behind the ambient shock .",
    "fig 2.3 shows a series of simulations from frank & mellema ( 1994 ) which illustrates the dependence of outflow geometry on initial conditions .",
    "fig 2.3 displays the evolution of density in four pne simulations .",
    "the equator to pole density contrast , @xmath78 , increases as one moves down the figure . for low values of @xmath78 , ( @xmath87 ) ,",
    "the bubble becomes mildly elliptical .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath78 , ( @xmath88 ) , produce distinct equatorial and polar regions of the ambient shock ; bipolar lobes develop .",
    "larger values of @xmath78 produce bubbles that are highly collimated .",
    "fig 2.3 demonstrates the ability of the gwbb model to produce different bubble shapes .",
    "the proof of the pudding is in the confrontation with observations and we will consider that aspect of the problem in the section on pne ( 3.1 ) .",
    "for now we simply state that these models recover many of the observed morphological , kinematic and ionization structures seen in real bipolar wbbs .",
    "the expansion speed of agb slow winds is often of the same magnitude as the ambient shock speed at the equator ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this is true of most situations where a wbb forms from a cooler star evolving into hot star ( sn87a ) .",
    "dwarkadas , chevalier & blondin ( 1996 ) recognized that this presented a problem and explored the effect of slow wind speeds on bipolar wbb evolution .",
    "their results demonstrated that the effects of a density contrast in the ambient medium are washed out if the ambient gas is expanding too fast . when the ambient shock and slow wind velocities are comparable , bubbles tend towards spherical or elliptical configurations .",
    "this occurs because the bubble shell is always `` catching up '' to the slow wind and no inertial constraint can be imposed .    dwarkadas .",
    "chevalier & blondin also provided the most detailed comparison between numerical simulations and analytical models available so far .",
    "their results confirm that the two approaches yield similar bubble shapes as long as the gas in the `` hot bubble '' remaines isobaric ( fig 2.4 ) .",
    "deviations from the isobaric condition produces bubbles which are narrower and more collimated than self - similar solutions predict . in most bipolar wbb models departures from the isobaric condition",
    "could be traced to the development of an aspherical wind shock .",
    "asphericity in the wind shock was not uniformly anticipated by researchers developing analytical models .",
    "most analytical studies have assumed a spherical wind shock while almost all simulations of bipolar wbbs produce wind shock s with prolate geometries .",
    "prolate wind shocks can be seen , for instance , in the all but the first simulation presented in fig 2.3 .",
    "the implications of aspherical wind shocks for bipolar wbbs dynamics has proven to be profound as we discuss in the next section .",
    "hydrodynamic jet collimation has , for the most part , fallen out of favor .",
    "currently the consensus in the astrophysical community holds that jets are collimated via mhd processes associated with accretion disks ( knigl 1989 , pudritz 1991 , shu 1997 ) .",
    "previous attempts to develop hydrodynamic jet collimation mechanisms relied primarily on delaval nozzles ( knigl 1982 , smith 1983 ) .",
    "a delaval nozzle is a means of turning random thermal motions into bulk supersonic flow by forcing hot gas to pass through a narrow constriction ( shu 1994 ) .",
    "the simulations discussed in the last section revived the issue of hydrodynamic jet collimation by demonstrating that jets could be effectively generated in bipolar wbbs .",
    "the collimation relies on the development of an aspherical wind shock to focus post - shock streamlines towards the axis .",
    "the role of the inner shock as a hydrodynamic lens was anticipated in analytical studies by both eichler 1982 and icke 1988 .",
    "the process seen in the simulations , termed shock focused inertial confinement ( sfic ) , appears to be one of the most effective and robust hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms currently known ( icke 1992 ) .",
    "it has been explored in a number of contexts including low and high mass ysos ( section 3.4 ; frank & mellema 1996 , mellema & frank 1998 , york & welz 1996 ) and relativistic jets from agn ( eulderink & mellema 1994 ) .",
    "the sfic mechanism relies primarily on the behavior of oblique shock waves . when the inward facing wind shock assumes a prolate geometry the radially streaming wind encounters the shock face at an oblique angle .",
    "only the normal component of the wind velocity feels the effect of the shock .",
    "tangential components of the velocity remain unchanged . in this way",
    "post - shock velocity vectors are tipped away from the shock normal and wind material is focused into a collimated beam .",
    "icke ( 1988 ) and frank & mellema ( 1996 ) presented analytical models for this process under the assumption of an elliptical inner shock .",
    "their results demonstrated that even mildly aspherical wind shocks could produce significant flow focusing .",
    "one of the most striking results of the analytical models was the prediction that _ supersonic _ post shock speeds can be achieved with out a delaval nozzle .",
    "frank & mellema dervied equations for the mach number behind an prolate elliptical wind shock .",
    "their results showed that supersonic collimated flows occur behind strongly aspherical adiabatic wind shocks .",
    "they also found that even mildly aspherical wind shocks can produce supersonic focusing if the post - shock flows cool effectively .",
    "this means that supersonic highly collimated jets can be formed even when no delaval nozzles are present .    in fig 2.5 we present results of a sfic jet collimation simulation from mellema & frank 1997 . in these simulations , appropriate to ysos",
    ", a spherical wind is driven into a stationary gaseous torus .",
    "radiation losses are included .",
    "the wind shock , apparent at the base of the flow , is strongly aspherical .",
    "this produces supersonic post - shock flow and initiates shock focusing which can be seen in a velocity vectors near the top of the wind shock .",
    "the overall collimation of the shocked wind into a narrow jet is clearly evident .",
    "note the presence of shocks within the beam which indicates that the jet is supersonic .",
    "the internal shocks are expected from the classical theory of supersonic jet dynamics ( norman 1993 ) .",
    "the bubble shown in fig 2.5 is effectively energy conserving and the jet is composed of relatively hot shocked wind gas . since the jet is supersonic the role of thermal energy in driving the bubble is relatively unimportant and the dynamics of the global flow pattern lies between that of a jet and a wbb .",
    "an additional hydrodynamic collimating mechanism becomes available in momentum conserving bubbles .",
    "when the wind shock is radiative post - shock material is compressed into a thin shell bounded on the outside by the contact discontinuity .",
    "if the bubble becomes prolate , wind material which passes through the inner shock is focused towards the poles as in the sfic mechanism . in a prolate radiative bubble",
    ", however , the narrow width of the shell constrains the post - shock flow .",
    "material is forced to stream along the contact discontinuity forming a _ converging conical flow _ as it reaches the poles .",
    "the opposing streams meet directly over the poles producing a shock that redirects gas into a jet .",
    "fig 2.6 presents a schematic of the process .",
    "since we are considering radiative shocks , converging conical flows will produce dense cold jets .",
    "this process was first investigated by cant & rodrguez ( 1980 ) .",
    "smith ( 1986 ) studied a similar version of the idea .",
    "cant , tenorio - tagle &  ryczka ( 1988 ) and tenorio - tagle ( 1988 ) used idealized analytical and numerical models treating the converging beams as initial conditions to explore the jet formation in greater detail . peter & eichler ( 1996 )",
    "have performed similar simulations in the context of converging disk winds .",
    "the simulations of mellema & frank ( 1997 ) placed the development of these flows in the context of global bipolar wbb evolution .",
    "their simulations demonstrated that such flows are a natural and robust consequence of the interaction between a wind and the surrounding material .",
    "fig 2.7 shows a the results of borkowski , blondin & harington ( 1997 ) who performed simulations of a wind expanding into a pressure stratified environment .",
    "their models were targeted at explaining the jet bearing pne he3 - 1475 .",
    "fig 2.7 shows that jets form as a natural consequence of aspherical radiative wbbs .",
    "recall that as a bubble expands the density in the wind immediately interior to the shock decreases as @xmath90 ( eqn . [ r2law ] ) .",
    "thus at some finite radius the wind shock will change from momentum conserving to energy conserving .",
    "if the geometry of the ambient medium takes the right form one can expect a era of jet collimation via converging conical flows followed by an energy conserving phase during which the sfic mechanism may operate .",
    "such a transition was observed in the models of mellema & frank ( 1997 ) and has been proposed to explain jets and ansae in pne by frank , balick & livio ( 1996 ) .",
    "recent calculations by dwarkadas & balick ( 1998a ) have shown that for some evolving winds cases instabilities along the shell can disrupt the converging flow .    while the studies cited above have all demonstrated that converging conical flows are a promising jet collimation mechanism there is an important caveat .",
    "it is not yet clear if the flow patterns are an artifact of the 2.5-d geometry used the simulations . in axisymmetric models",
    "the axis is a rigid boundary .",
    "converging flows have no choice but to refect off the axis . in 3-d",
    "the convergence point could be unstable .",
    "if material is not perfectly focused to a point a time - variable spray rather than a tightly collimated beam may result .",
    "it is therefore important not to be carried away by highly symmetric results from highly symmetric models .",
    "the final judgement will require 3-d models .",
    "care must be taken here as well .",
    "low resolution 3-d models may not adequately answer the question as material will have to fragment on size scales larger than a computational cell . achieving high resolution will be particularly important for determining the efficacy of radiative hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms .",
    "the gwbb model relies on the presence of an aspherical environmental density distribution - a dense torus .",
    "there is evidence for the existence of such distribution in both young and evolved stars .",
    "toroidal distributions with high pole to equator contrasts have been observed in the predecessors of pne ( meixner 1997 ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that many agb stars show spherical circumstellar envelopes up until the very end of the agb phase .",
    "the existence of disks and flattened density distributions surrounding ysos is also well established ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 , cabrit 1996 ) .    for ysos the orgin of toroidal density distributions",
    "is easily explained via the collapse of a rotating or magnetized cloud or the collapse of a filament ( tereby , cassin & shu 1984 , li & shu 1996 , hartmann , calvet & boss 1996 ) .",
    "the density distribution in these systems will take the form of a thin disk on small scales with thicker toroids perhaps existing on larger scales ( close 1997 ) .",
    "for evolved stars however , the origin of the toroids poses a serious and interesting challenge . a number of _ single star _",
    "processes have been proposed including dust formation instabilities ( dorfi & hoefner 1996 ) and star spots ( frank 1995 , soker 1998 ) .",
    "these mechanisms almost all rely on rotation in one way or another ( asida & tuchman 1995 )    the wind compressed disk ( wcd ) mechanism of bjorkman & cassinelli 1992 has been one of the most promising single star models explored to date ( owocki , cranmer & blondin 1994 ) .",
    "wcd formation is effective for rotating stars .",
    "wind streamlines are deflected towards the axis in the competition of radial radiation pressure forces and the coriolis effect .",
    "the wcd mechanism produces an `` excretion disk '' which flows away from the star .",
    "though the model was originally intended for b[e ] stars it has been applied to other classes of objects including agb stars ( ignace , bjorkman & cassinelli 1996 ) . in most cases the rotation rate of the star needs to be a signifigant fraction of the critical rotation rate for signifigant wind compression to occur .",
    "garcia - segura , langer & maclow ( 1997 ) have noted that the critical rotation rate depends on the luminosity of the star via    @xmath91    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "@xmath94 may approach the actual rotation rate of the star as its luminosity increases .",
    "thus the wcd mechanism may be particularly effective for stars close to their eddington limit ( lbvs ) .",
    "the greatest advantage of the wcd model is that it links the properties of the stellar progenitor directly to the bipolar bubble .",
    "the wcd model produces density and velocity distributions for the ambient medium which can be fed directly into gwbb models ( garcia - sequra , langer & maclow 1997 ; collins 1998 ) .",
    "recent research has however casts some doubt on the effectivelness of the wcd mechanism in line driven winds ( owocki 1996 ) .",
    "its fate in other contexts remain a important area of research .    the work of livio , soker and collaborators ( livio & soker 1988 ; soker & livio 1994 ; rasio & livio 1996 ; soker 1997 ) has provided strong support for the role of binary companions in producing the equatorial density enhancements . as these authors have shown , red giant rotation rates are too low to allow any of the mechanisms explored to date to produce dense slowly expanding toroids .",
    "thus spin - up of the stars is most likely required to produce the required rotation speeds for mechanisms such as the wcd model .",
    "this can be accomplished via tidal interactions or the spiraling - in of a companion in a common envelope phase .",
    "a binary merger can also dump enough energy into the atmosphere of the primary to eject it .",
    "numerical models of the process demonstrate that much of the envelope mass is ejected into the orbital plane of the binary producing the required pole to equator density contrast ( terman , taam & hernquist 1994 , 1995 , sandquist 1998 ) .",
    "soker ( 1997a ) has concluded that the distinction between binary and single star models may be a semantic since even brown dwarf companions or giant planets can lead to aspherical environments . in particular ,",
    "soker 1996 has shown that a jupiter sized planet could contribute enough spin - up to distort a giant star wind into a configuration whereby the gwbb scenario would produce an elliptical nebula .",
    "how important are binary companions for the formation of a slow torus ?",
    "this is one of the critical issues facing bipolar ouflow studies .",
    "while there is obervational evidence for the presence of binaries in bipolar pne ( pollacco 1998 ) it is not yet clear if single star bipolars greatly outnumber binary bipolars .",
    "the lack of sufficent binaries may be answered by appeals to coalesence in a common envelope phase .",
    "if this is true it would be useful to find an obervational signature of coalesence in the central star , do pne central stars which are the product of a merger look different from the products of single star evolution ?",
    "another issue which must be addressed is the speed of the slow torus in a binary ejection model .",
    "simulations seem to indicate that the when the giant s envelope is ejected in a binary merger the highest speeds are obtained at the equator . as dwarkadas , chevalier & blondin",
    "have shown , this could reduce the effectiveness of the gwbb process . in spite of these problems",
    ", it appears that the presence of some form of companion will be required to produce slow torii and , hence , bipolar outflows .",
    "thus far we have focused on models where the shaping of the bipolar bubbles is accomplished solely though hydrodynamic forces .",
    "the development of a preferred axis for the bubble s expansion can , of course , occur in other ways .",
    "the most likely alternative is a magnetic field .",
    "pascoli ( 1985 , 1997 ) and gurzadyan ( 1996 ) have both proposed models where fields embedded in the ambient medium ( a previously ejected wind ) produce the bipolar morphologies .",
    "evidence for the existence of these fields remains ambiguous .",
    "motivated by the desire to find a model which could produce bipolar outflows without the need of a companion star chevalier & luo ( 1994 ) developed a model which relied on hydromagnetic forces in the stellar wind itself .",
    "using the sun as a template they argued that rotation of the star produces a stellar wind with a dominantly toroidal field ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "when the magnetized wind passes through the wind shock compression strengthens the field .",
    "if the initial field is strong enough , magnetic pinch forces , also known as _ hoop stresses _ , from the toroidal field constrain the expansion of the bubble along the equator .",
    "no such force inhibits the bubble along the poles and a bipolar bubble develops without a dense torus .",
    "a critical parameter for these models is the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy in the wind ,    @xmath96    where the @xmath97 subscripts refer to values at the stellar surface and @xmath98 is rotation velocity of the star .",
    "the expression on the right hand side of equation [ sigeq ] is based on the assumed form of the magnetic field . using an analytical formulation of the problem chevalier & luo ( 1994 ) demonstrated that magnetic forces in the hot bubble ( they assumed an adiabatic wind shock ) could produce significant departures from spherical morphologies . for a strong bipolar morphology to develop they found that @xmath99 ( soker 1997a ) .",
    "axisymmetric ( 2.5-d ) numerical models of this mechanism have been calculated by rozyczka & franco ( 1996 ) and gracia - segura ( 1997 ) .",
    "these models confirmed the feasibility of the luo & chevalier scenario ( fig 2.8 ) and demonstrated that realistic bipolar shapes could be obtained .",
    "new features were also seen including the potential for jet collimation via the magnetic hoop stresses .",
    "fully 3-d models have been presented by garcia - sequra 1997 . in these simulations",
    "precession of the star s magnetic axis produced precession in the bubble as a whole including a jet which formed within the bubble ( fig 2.9 ) .",
    "the resulting shapes were quite similar to the point - symmetric morphologies observed in some pne ( schwarz , corradi & melnick 1992 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy however that garcia - sequra was forced to include a slow torus ( calculated via the wcd formalism ) in his calculations in order to form narrow jets .",
    "in addition , a rather particular sequence of two or three winds were invoked to produce the desired results .    the _ magnetized wind bubble _ ( mwb ) models outlined above offer an strong alternative to the `` classic '' gwbb formalism for producing bipolar outflows in evolved stars .",
    "if , however , the gwbb scenario has already proven to be effective one can ask what purpose is served by invoking magnetic fields .",
    "the question is particularly relevant since evidence for the existence of strong fields in bipolar wbbs does not yet exist while the presence of gaseous toroids has been established .",
    "one of their most attractive features the mwb scenario is its ability to impose large scale non - axisymetric patterns such as point symmetry on bipolar bubbles . while it may be possible to achieve such patterns in purely hydrodynamic flows by invoking a `` wobble '' in the gaseous torus , magnetic fields are `` stiffer '' and",
    "can offer a longer lever arm for achieving coherence across large length scales .",
    "other mhd mechanisms such as collimated accretion disk winds offer similar advantages ( soker & livio 1994 , livio & pringle 1997 ) .",
    "criticism of the mwb models hinges both on the strength and topology of the field ( soker 1997a , livio 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the mwb model have used very high values of the field , @xmath100 , to achieve strong collimation ( garcia - segura 1997 ) . as soker 1997a has pointed out these values where chosen based on conditions in the sun where the wind is driven by the magnetic field .",
    "the winds which produce bipolar wbbs surrounding evolved stars however are radiatively driven making the sun is a poor template . for bipolar pne ,",
    "chevalier & luo 1994 point out that only a small fraction of white - dwarfs show magnetic fields strong enough to justify the values of @xmath101 used in the numerical simulations .",
    "soker 1997a has also raised the issue of field topology .",
    "the mwb model requires the the field to circle the star in the planes parallel to the equator . in the solar wind",
    "however this is not the case . the magnetic field in the solar wind",
    "is composed of distinct sectors across which the field reverses sign ( livio 1997 , bieber & rust 1995 , gosling 1996 ) .",
    "a similar problem arises for the direction of the field across the equatorial plane .",
    "both solar observations and dynamo models show that @xmath102 has opposite polarity between the two hemispheres ( weis 1994 ) .",
    "thus the field must go through zero at the equator , just where it is needed most . in his 3-d models garcia - segura ( 1997 ) chose @xmath103 giving the field its maximum value at the equator .",
    "even if the @xmath102 transition is narrow the field reversal at the bubble s equator should be unstable to tearing mode instabilities and reconnection ( priest 1984 ) .",
    "diffusive processes such as reconnection convert magnetic energy needed for collimation into thermal energy and pressure which would inflate equatorial regions .",
    "estimation of the reconnection time in a mwb is difficult because the processes which drive reconnection are not clearly understood ( lazarian & vishniac 1998 ) .",
    "there is a long standing debate concerning the existence of `` fast '' reconnection processes ( parker 1979 ) . in general",
    "the reconnection rate should go as @xmath104 where l is a characteristic size scale and @xmath105 is the speed with which flux can be driven into the reconnection zone .",
    "when collisional effects alone are considered the resistivity in cosmic plasmas is very low .",
    "when theoretical models such as the sweet - parker process ( cowley 1985 ) use these forms for the resitivity they yield @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the local alfvn velocity .",
    "while many theoretical arguments produce extremely slow reconnection speeds observational evidence from solar flares , indicates that @xmath108 ( dere 1996 , innes 1997 ) .",
    "if such scalings hold in the hot bubble of a mwb then the time scale over which magnetic energy in the equatorial regions will be dissipated , @xmath109 can be calculated .",
    "since the size scale of field reversal region @xmath110 , is unknown we will calculate the timescale @xmath111 for all the magentic flux in a mwb of size @xmath14 to be convected into and dissipated within the reconnetion zone ,    @xmath112    where @xmath113 . note that unless @xmath114 a large scale gradient in @xmath115 would exist which would negate the fields ability to produce collimation .",
    "thus @xmath116 and @xmath111 represents a upper limit to the time - scale for reconnection to be important .",
    "the alfvn velocity can be determined from the initial conditions for the bubble . since",
    "magnetic forces are expected to be comparable to gas pressure forces we may assume equipartion such that @xmath117 . in this way one may show that    @xmath118    ( _ cf _ dagni & soker 1998 ) . if we use canonical values of @xmath119 cm and @xmath120 we find @xmath121 y. this is comparible to the dynamical timescale for many pne .",
    "thus it is possible that reconnection will play an important role in the evolution of a mwb by changing the field topology and converting magnetic energy into heat and hence thermal pressure .",
    "in the last section we discussed physical processes which shape bipolar outflows . the physics was generic and could be obtained in any bipolar wbb . in what follows we consider applications of these ideas focusing separately on each class of stellar environment in which bipolar wbb occur .",
    "pne have a long history of serving as laboratories for new astrophysical processes ( forbidden lines are the most famous example osterbrock ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "they have played a similar role in understanding bipolar outflows . as we have discussed in preceding sections ,",
    "pne are interacting wind systems - a fast tenuous wind from a hot central star expands into slow dense wind expelled during the star s agb phase ( kwok 1979 , kahn 1983 ) .",
    "kahn & west 1985 were the first to consider a gwbb model for pne . compiling a catalog of pne with various shapes balick ( 1987 ) expanded on the theme outlining a broad gwbb paradigm which embraced the majority of pne observations .",
    "balick s conjecture was successfully explored for the first time in icke , balick & preston ( 1989 ) via an analytical kompaneets ( 1960 ) formalism .",
    "the numerical models discussed section 2.3 confirmed the validity of the gwbb model for pne . as was discussed in section 2.6",
    "the equatorial density enhancement in the agb wind required for balick s scenario is likely to occur via the effects of a companion star .",
    "confrontaion between pne models and reality became possible with the advent of radiation - gasdynamic simulations .",
    "the simultaneous computation of hydrodynamics and radiative / microphysical processes allowed _ synthetic observations _ of the models to be computed by rotating 2.5-d emissition maps about the symmetry axis and projecting them on the sky at different inclinations .",
    "fig 3.1 shows a figure from frank 1993 where a single pne model projected at six different angles is compared with six real pne .",
    "the rings apparent in the synthetic observations are high density regions formed where the shock outlining the lobes intersects with the shock defining the equatorial regions of the bubble .",
    "as the projection angle increases the rings come to dominate the synthetic shapes producing `` eyes '' like those seen in the owl nebula .",
    "fig 3.1 demonstrates that when projection effects are included even a single gwbb model can embrace many of the observed pne shapes .",
    "we must note an inherent danger in creating synthetic observations from 2.5-d simulations .",
    "when instabilities such as corrugations occur in the shell of an axisymmetric simulation these features will , upon rotation and projection , appear as rings .",
    "it must be emphisized that such rings are entirely unrealistic .",
    "there is no apriori reason to believe locally driven instabilities will take so a coherent a form when allowed to evolve in 3 dimensions . when considering the effect of instabilities on the _ appearence _ of of bipolar wbbs fully 3-d models are required .",
    "a successful model must also account for the kinematics of pne .",
    "fig 3.2 shows a series of synthetic position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams for the simulation shown in fig 3.1 . in each of the 6 panels the slit",
    "is placed along the long axis of the bubble . as the projection angle of the bubble",
    "is increased a skewed figure * 8 * pattern emerges .",
    "the skewing of the pv pattern emerges as high velocity material at the top ( bottom ) of the bubble is blue ( red ) shifted in projection onto the line of sight .",
    "such patterns have been well documented in observations ( balick , preston & icke 1987 , odell , weiner & chu 1990 , corradi & schwarz 1993abc ) .",
    "together with synthetic images these kinematical predictions show that the gwbb model offers quite a good match to a large subset of the observational database .",
    "one would expect that alternative models for bipolar pne offer at least as good a match without increasing the number of input assumptions .",
    "schwarz , corradi & melnick ( 1992 ) and manchado ( 1997 ) have produced more extensive catalogs of pne shapes .",
    "statistical studies with this enlarged sample allow inferences to be drawn about the relation between pne and their central stars ( stanghellini , corradi , schwarz , 1993 ) .",
    "one intriguing conclusion of this work is that strongly bipolar pne tend to originate from more massive stars .",
    "such a correlation may originate in the rapid evolution ( @xmath122 y ) of pne central stars from a cool ( @xmath123 k ) giant to a hot ( @xmath124 k ) dwarf configuration ( schonberner 1986 ) .",
    "since the ionizing flux increases with @xmath125 and the velocity of the central star wind is radiation driven , the wind evolves along with the star ( kudritzki , pauldrach & abbott 1989 ) .",
    "stellar evolution models show the fastest evolution for more massive central stars .",
    "mellema ( 1995 ) included the evolution of both the central star and stellar wind in his numerical models . during the early stages of evolution in his simulations , ionization fronts deposited enough energy and momentum in the agb wind to change its geometry before the bubble reached a bipolar configuration .",
    "the ionization of the agb torus produces a strong pressure gradient .",
    "gas is driven off the torus towards the pole decreasing the density contrast ( mellema & frank 1995 ) . mellema ( 1997 ) demonstrated that this effect leads to a morphological segregation between pne from high and low mass stars .",
    "more massive stars evolve quickly and produce higher velocity winds relatively early compared with their lower mass cousins . in the higher mass case the ambient shock reaches large radii quickly before the pre - shaping of the environment by ionization is significant .",
    "thus massive star bubbles experience the full effect of the initial density contrast in the agb wind and attain strongly bipolar configurations .",
    "rotation of the central star during both its agb and pne phase may play an important role . in the models of garcia - segura ( 1997 )",
    "rotation in the agb envelope produces a equatorial enhancement via the wcd model ( section 2.6 ) .",
    "rotation of the star is also necessary to produce the strong fields needed for the mwb models .",
    "the use of the wcd model for red giant stars is a very promising avenue of research which can be applied to other classes of bipolar wbbs ( sn87a , section 3.3 ; collins 1998 ) .",
    "it is worth noting here however that it not yet clear how the wcd mechanism will work in giant star envelopes .",
    "models of agb winds rely on radiation pressure on dust while the wcd mechanism was formulated for line - driven winds .",
    "this issue should be addressed in detail in future research .    many pne exhibit well collimated jets or pairs of high velocity knots aligned along the major axis of the nebula .",
    "some of these features , known as ansae ( aller 1947 ) , are part of a broader class of structures called fliers ( fast moving low ionization emission regions ) which exist in many pne ( balick 1993 , 1994 , hajian 1997 ) .",
    "the origin of the jets and ansae is currently a subject of considerable debate .",
    "hydrodynamic mechanisms such as sfic or converging conical flows have been proposed by mellema 1996 and frank , balick & livio ( 1996 ) .",
    "mhd mechanisms based on the chevalier & luo mwb model have also been explored ( garcia -segura 1997 ) . in livio and soker ( 1994 ) and livio & pringle ( 1996 )",
    "the jets have been linked to magento - centrifugal processes associated with an accretion disk .",
    "the disk forms around either the binary companion or around the primary .",
    "mellema ( 1998 ) and hajian ( 1998 ) have also explored a model where ansae result from photoionized clumps of gas experiencing the oort - spitzer rocket effect .",
    "the fact that many jets and ansae appear outside the apparent position of the ambient shock argues that they formed before the onset of a classical gwbb phase .",
    "the focus then shifts to the elusive proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) .",
    "these are objects currently making the transition from agb to pne .",
    "many ppne such as the egg nebula ( crl2688 sahai 1998a , 1998b ) already show highly collimated high speed ( @xmath126 ) outflows .",
    "the occurrence of bipolar outflows so early in the transition may pose a problem for both the gwbb and mwb models because the star is too cool to produce a high speed wind .",
    "if magnetized accretion disks form in these systems it might solve the problem via some kind of disk wind .",
    "there are however examples of pne which show jets forming from an evacuated cavity where no disk is apparent ( he3 - 1357 ; bobrowsky 1998 ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that much of the agb mass loss surrounding bipolar ppne appears spherically symmetric .",
    "this indicates that the toroidal wind or accretion disk occurs very late in the agb phase ( livio 1997 ) .",
    "the origin of bipolar ppne outflows constitutes one of the most important issues currently facing pne and bipolar outflow studies .    in the years since balick published his catalog",
    "it has become clear that point - symmetry is a characteristic in many pne .",
    "the * s * shaped morphology of the jet bearing pne fl 1 ( lopez , meaburn , & palmer 1993 ; palmer , lopez , meaburn , & lloyd 1996 ) is the archetypical example of this class of pne .",
    "many point - symmetric pne exhibit the morphology solely in a series of opposing knots .",
    "cliffe ( 1995 ) have modeled these systems as as episodic precessing jets .",
    "lopez , vazquez & rodriguez ( 1995 ) have proposed that the systems represent a separate class of pne defined as bipolar rotating episodic jets or _",
    "brets_. the origin of these point symmtreic patterns is one of the most intriguing aspects of pne studies .",
    "as we discussed in section 2.7 it would seem that models which invoke magnetic fields near the source may provide a better means for generating point symmetry in jets than hydrodynamic models .",
    "this point needs to be explored further .",
    "there are also a number of bipolar pne which show a point - symmetric brightness distribution imposed on their opposing lobes even though no jet is visible ( hb 5 , corradi & schwarz 1993c ) .",
    "these systems are particularly puzzling and their origin remains relatively unexplored .",
    "cliffe ( 1995 ) conjectured that the bipolar lobes in these systems represented _ global _ bow shocks surrounding precessing jets .",
    "this raises the issue that pne jets may not always appear as the bright central beams like those associated with ysos .",
    "there are highly collimated pne ( m2 - 9 ; balick , icke & mellema 1998 ) and ppne ( bobrowsky 1998 , trammell & goodrich 1996 ) which appear hollow .",
    "why only some pne would produce visible jets is unknown .",
    "inspection of the catalog of schwarz corridi & melnick 1992 shows that in total at least 7% of all pne exhibit either the _ s _ shaped jets or the point symmetric brightness pattern .",
    "in addition other classes of bipolar outflows ( lbvs ; weis 1996 , ysos ; reipurth , bally & devine 1997 ) show point symmetry making the issue rather pressing for future studies .",
    "luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are massive unstable stars known to experience mass ejections and dramatic increases in luminosity ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "recent observations have revealed a number of lbvs or lbv candidates to be surrounded by extended aspherical outflows .",
    "the most extraordinary of these is the markedly bipolar nebula surrounding @xmath0 carinae ( `` the homunculus '' : hester 1991 ebbets 1993 humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "other lbvs show nebulae with varying degrees of asphericity from elliptical ( r127 ) to strongly bipolar ( hr carinae : nota 1995 ; weis 1996 ) .",
    "these shapes are quite similar to what has been observed in planetary nebulae ( pne ) leading to the suggestion that both families of objects are shaped in similar ways .",
    "so far the homunculus of @xmath0 car is the best studied of all lbv bipolar outflows .",
    "@xmath0 car is an extraordinary star , one of the massive known in the galaxy @xmath127 . in the 1840s it became the second brightest star in the sky",
    "outburst _ must have been accompanied by a rapid and dramatic increase in mass loss .",
    "proper motion studies of the homunculus ( currie 1996a ) indicate that the bipolar nebula was expelled during the giant outburst .",
    "one of the most suggestive features in early hst images of the homunculus was an apparent disk of material surrounding the waist of the bipolar lobes .",
    "this configuration has been described as an `` ant in a tutu '' by davidson ( private communication 1995 ) .",
    "the presence of a disk naturally suggested that the bubble was formed via the gwbb process .",
    "in frank , balick & davidson ( 1995 hereafter : fbd ) a gwbb model for @xmath0 car was presented in which a spherical _ outburst wind _ expelled during the 1840 outburst expanded into a toroidal ( disk - shaped ) _ pre - outburst wind_. fbd showed that the resulting bipolar outflow could recover both the gross morphology and kinematics of the homunculus .",
    "nota , livio clampin & schulte - ladbeck ( 1995 hereafter nlcs ) presented one of the first catalogs of lbv nebulae . using a model similar to the one invoked by fbd , they presented a unified picture of the development of lbv outflows .",
    "garcia - segura , langer & maclow 1997 ( hereafter glm ) presented a model for @xmath0 car which also relied on the gwbb scenario but changed the order of importance of the winds .",
    "the novel aspect of glm s study was to include the effects of stellar rotation . using the wcd model for the first time in a bipolar bubble calculation",
    ", glm showed that a strong equator to pole density contrast would likely form _ during the outburst _ when a star is close to the eddington limit , @xmath128 .",
    "since the critical rotation speed goes as @xmath129 stars close to their eddington luminosity do not have to be spun up to produce a wind compressed disk .",
    "thus in the glm model the outburst wind creates the slow torus and the _ post - outburst _ mass loss ( which was not considered in either fbd or nlcs ) acts as the fast wind inflating the bipolar bubble .",
    "glm s models also included initial seed perturbations which drove thin shell instabilities ( vishniac 1983 , 1994 ) .",
    "these fragmented the shell in ways which may , in a fully 3-d model , lead to small scale structures similar to the `` worms '' , corrugations and dark lanes seen on the surface of the @xmath0 car s bipolar lobes ( morse 1998 ) .",
    "as more detailed images and analysis of the homunculus have become available ( morse 1998 ) it has become clear that disk surrounding @xmath0 car is not cylindrically symmetric . rather than a continuous structure it appears to be a discontinuous clumpy `` skirt '' of debris .",
    "the large angular gaps in the skirt make any gwbb model which invokes an extended disk difficult to support .",
    "it is hard to image how such a structure could simultaneously confine a spherical outflow and become highly fractured on large angular scales . in addition",
    "morse 1998 and currie 1996b have shown that the morphology of the lobes is more like that of two flasks connected at their necks rather than two osculating bubbles .",
    "we note that ag car shows a similar morphology ( ncls ) .",
    "to rectify this situation and embrace the full range of lbv nebulae frank 1998 have performed simulations which further generalize the gwbb scenario .",
    "these models turn the gwbb scenario on its head by considering the case of an _ aspherical fast wind _ interacting with a _",
    "isotropic slow wind_. frank 1998 imagined a fast wind ejected with higher velocity along the poles than along the equator .",
    "there is both observational and theoretical support for this idea .",
    "lamers & pauldrach 1991 have demonstrated that rotation induced changes in optical depth can produce a bistable wind with high velocity and low density in the poles and low velocity and high density in the equator .",
    "observations of the wind of ag carinae ( leitherer 1994 ) imply a pattern of densities and velocities from pole to equator much like that described in lamers & pauldrach 1991 .",
    "owocki 1996 have also shown that fast poleward directed winds may be a natural consequence of hot rapidly rotating stars .",
    "the simulations of frank demonstrated that bipolar outflows which matched the shapes of lbv nebulae could be produced via aspherical fast winds .",
    "fig 3.3 shows a comparison of the models of frank and mcl with the lbvs @xmath130 car and ag car .",
    "note that the aspherical fast winds appear to produce a flask morphology better than the models involving a wcd .",
    "clearly one drawback of the frank scenario is the lack of an equatorial spray in a nebulae like @xmath0 car .",
    "recent evidence however suggestes that the equatorial spray was formed during a later smaller outburst in 1890 ( smith & gertz 1998 ) .",
    "more recently dwarkadas & balick 1998 have attempted to deal with the issue of eta car s equatorial region by assuming the existence of dense ring of gas on scales of @xmath131 cm .",
    "the ring is confined to a narrow region in the equator so that ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "these models recover the flask shape with out an extended disk .",
    "in addition as the ring is accelerated outward it fragments due to dynamical instabilities ( jones , kang , & tregillis 1994 ) .",
    "since it is easier to destroy a thin ring via non - axisymmetric instabilities than an extended disk this model holds the promise of of creating both the flask shaped bipolar lobes and the equatorial spray .",
    "of course the issue then becomes the origin of the ring .",
    "we have not considered wolf - rayet nebula extensively in this review because they are generally spherical or ellipitical rather than bipolar there are exceptions however ( ngc 6888 , garcia - segura & maclow 1995 ) .",
    "this raises the question : why are there no strongly bipolar wr bubbles ?",
    "the answer may lie in the evolutionary considerations .",
    "a connection between wr stars and lbvs has been proposed by langer 1994 and the evolution of the star and the wind has been linked to instabilities in wbb shells ( garcia - sequra , mac low & langer 1996 ) .",
    "it is possible that wr stars are too far from the eddington limit for rotation to induce the wcd mechanism .",
    "if the star evolves into a near eddington - limit lbv an equatorial density enhancement may form which then will lead to a bipolar bubble .",
    "this is an attractive idea however it begs the question of why so many pne exhibit bipolar shapes when they are not close to their eddington luminosities .",
    "further research is needed on this point and currently the lack of bipolarity in wr bubbles remains a mystery .",
    "the rings surrounding sn87a ( burrows 1995 ) provide yet another example of a circumstellar bipolar outflow .",
    "the intense scrutiny applied to sn87a make it a unique laboratory for studying the connection between bipolar outflow and stellar evolution .",
    "recently brander 1997 have discovered a bipolar outflow surrounding sher 25 a star is similar to the progenitor of sn87a .",
    "thus it is possible that sn87a defines a new class of bipolar outflows .",
    "when the central ring of sn87a was discovered it was quickly interpreted as the waist of a bipolar wbb ( luo & mccray 1991 , wang & mazzali 1992 ) . in these models",
    "the ambient medium is taken to be a toroidal shaped wind deposited by sn87a s progenitor in a red supergiant ( rsg ) stage .",
    "the bubble was subsequently inflated by a fast wind from the star s penultimate incarnation as a blue supergiant ( bsg ) .",
    "the first numerical simulations of this process were carried out by blondin & lundqvsit 1993 ) who used an inverted form of the icke function ( equation [ ad2 ] ) for the slow rsg wind .",
    "blondin & lundqusit 1994 were quite successful in demonstrating the feasibility of the gwbb paradigm for sn87a .",
    "the low expansion speed of the central ring ( @xmath133 ) presented a problem however . to create a model with the correct kinematics , blondin & lundqusit",
    "were forced to adopt rather low values of both the rsg and bsg wind wind velocities .",
    "their value of the rsg wind speed , @xmath134  seemed particularly anomalous .",
    "canonical values for the rsg wind speeds is of order 20 km / s .",
    "blondin & lundqusit were also forced to take an equator to pole density contrast of @xmath135 which at the time seemed large .",
    "the size of @xmath78 was one reason cited by mccray and lin 1992 in their arguments that the ambient density distribution represented a remnant protostellar disk rather than a stellar wind .",
    "the discovery of additional upper and lower rings of sn87a both confirmed and confused the image of sn87a s nebula as a bipolar outflow .",
    "initially the extra rings were interpreted as traces of a precessing jet ( burrows 1995 ) .",
    "martin and arnett ( 1994 ) carried out gwbb simulations similar to blondin and lundqvist and claimed that the upper and lower rings were limb brightened projection of the bipolar lobes .",
    "martin and arnett s models were noteworthy in that they included the transport of radiation from the supernova and followed the concomitant microphysics ( ionization , etc . ) in the nebula .",
    "they confirmed blondin & lundqusit s results including the need for low rsg wind speeds @xmath136 km / s .",
    "while their conclusion concerning the upper and lower rings was based on the production of synthetic images ( fig 3.4 ) it does not mesh well with the detials of the observations .",
    "fig 3.4 shows the star at the center of the two nested ellipses formed by the projection of the lobes .",
    "this is identical to what was seen the models of frank 1993 ( fig 3.1 ) .",
    "there is , however , a striking lack of symmetry in the upper and lower rings of sn87a not present in the synthetic image .",
    "the real rings are considerably off center with respect to the star .",
    "martin and arnett were cognizant of these issues and suggested that motion of the nebulae through the ambient medium might distort the lobes in and beak the symmetry of the rings .",
    "this conjecture will need to be tested using 3-d models .",
    "consideration of the hst images also shows that in addition to the symmetry breaking the rings do not exactly close on each themselves .",
    "finally it is not clear if the actual intensity structure of the rings can be identified with limb brightening of a lobe .",
    "thus is appears that the rings are a real density or emissivity structure inherent to the lobes and a number of authors have developed models for their formation    dwarkadas & chevalier 1995 considered the effect of the uv flux from the blue supergiant proposing that the upper and lower rings are the location of an ionization front breakout .",
    "photons escape from the low density polar sector of the lobes but are trapped at lower latitudes .",
    "the rings have also been explained via pre - shaping of the rsg envelope via ionization ( meyer 1997 ) or the action of a binary companion ( podsiadlowski , 1991 ; lloyd , oobrien & kahn 1995 ) .",
    "none of these scenarios has proven more compelling than the others and the upper and lower rings remain one of the fundamental mysteries of sn87a .",
    "their nature may become more apparent when the supernova blast wave overtakes the central ring and illuminates the rest of the nebula ( luo 1994 ) .",
    "the existence of the aspherical rsg wind has led a number of authors to posit the existence of a binary companion for the progenitor of sn87a . using arguments from stellar evolution theory along with",
    "the need for a high equator to pole contrast , podsiadlowski ( 1992 ) has calculated a likely progenitor mass of 3 to 6 with the progenitor taking values of 16 . in a recent calculation collins 1998 attempted to form a direct link between the shape of the bipolar wbb and the binary status of progenitor . using the wcd model to specify the shape of the rsg wind and the guiliani solution to calculate the bubble evolution collins demonstrated that a wind compressed environment could reproduce correct shape of sn87a s nebula including the kinematics of the inner ring .",
    "a rsg wind of @xmath137 km / s could be used since the wcd model naturally produces low velocities in the equator .",
    "the rotation speeds needed by the wcd model were too high ( @xmath138 ) to be explained by single star models .",
    "thus a companion was required to spin up the star . using a simplified analysis of the merger of the progenitor with mass @xmath139 and a companion with mass @xmath140 seperated initially by a distance @xmath141 , collins used conservation of angular momentum to derive the following equation @xmath142 @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 correspond to the moment of inertia , mass and radius of the envelope of the merged star respectively and @xmath146 . solving the above for the mass ratio of the two stars allowed collins to set a lower limit on the companion mass of @xmath147 . while the actual mass of a companion is likely to be larger than this ,",
    "the low mass predicted is consistent with the lack of an observed binary in sn87a ( crotts , kunkle & heathcote 1995 ) .",
    "as stars evolve to the main sequence they experience vigorous episodes of mass loss .",
    "observations have shown that outflows from ysos take two striking and fairly ubiquitous forms .",
    "molecular outflows define the first class .",
    "these are large - scale bipolar flows of material seen primarily in the lines of molecules such as @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "typical speeds of the outflows are on the order of @xmath150 km / s .",
    "the second generic class of outflow are highly collimated jets , visible primarily , in the optical .",
    "the jets are also bipolar in the sense that opposing `` counter jets '' are often seen .",
    "these jets have proper motions which indicate velocities of order @xmath151 .",
    "both the jets and outflows show features which imply variations in the outflow direction and velocity .",
    "yso jets and molecular outflows have been the subject of intense research activity and a number of excellent review articles exist ( bachiller 1996 , reipurth 1997 ) .",
    "the connection between these objects and other classes of bipolar stellar outflow has not been explored however . in this section",
    "we will briefly review two issues concerning ysos which are relevant to bipolar outflows as a broad class of phenomena : ( 1 ) jet collimation ; ( 2 ) the origin of molecular outflows .    *",
    "jet collimation * as was discussed in previous sections the current consensus holds that yso jets are launched and collimated by mhd processes .",
    "the most popular models rely on magneto - centrifugal forces in either an accretion disk ( `` disk - winds '' ; knigl 1989 , pudritz 1991 ) or at the disk - star boundary ( `` x - winds '' ; shu 1997 ) .",
    "these studies have been quite successful in articulating the physical properties of mhd collimation processes . indeed , numerical simulations ouyed & pudritz 1997 have recently demonstrated the ability of disk - wind models to produce both steady and time dependent jets .",
    "models which rely on the interaction of a dipole stellar field tied to an accretion disk have also shown promise ( lovelace , romanova , bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 , goodson winglee & bohm 1997 ) .    in spite of these successes",
    "many questions remain .",
    "the existence of a variety of working models makes it uncertain which mechanism ysos choose if mhd is the dominant launching _ and _ collimation process .",
    "there are also questions as to the effectiveness of _ collimation _ in mhd models .",
    "shu 1995 point out mhd collimation can be a slow process occurring logarithmically with height above the disk .",
    "ostriker 1997 has pointed out self - similar mhd disk winds have low asymptotic speeds in cases where they become fully ( cylindrically ) collimated with @xmath152 decreasing faster than @xmath153 with radius .",
    "in addition , a different set of numerical simulations ( romanova 1997 ) found that while the magneto - centrifugal process was effective at launching a wind , it did not produce strong collimation of the wind into a jet .",
    "along with these issues , the pure hydrodynamic sfic and converging conical flow mechanisms discussed in section 2.4 and 2.5 can be surprisingly effective at producing jets in yso environments .",
    "hydrodynamic collimation in ysos is not a new subject .",
    "knigl ( 1982 ) presented a very complete study of delaval nozzles as a means for producing collimation in yso outflows .",
    "raga & cant ( 1989 ) explored the role of cooling in delaval nozzles appropriate to ysos .",
    "the original work on conical converging flows by cant and collaborators was directed towards ysos . in many of these studies a stellar wind interacting with environmental _ pressure _ gradients produced a stationary aspherical wind blown cavity .",
    "the strongest objection to these models was the collimation scale length ( knigl & ruden 1993 ) .",
    "observations show that in many jets collimation must occur on scales of order @xmath154 ( ray 1996 ) .",
    "this is too small for pressure confinement .",
    "the more recent studies of frank & mellema ( 1996 ) and mellema & frank ( 1997 ) which applied time - dependent wbb hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms to ysos attempted to address these issues .",
    "these papers demonstrated that the sfic and converging conical flow processes could generate well collimated supersonic jets in environments appropriate to the earliest or `` class 0 '' protostars . in mellema & frank ( 1997 )",
    "the effects of both inertial and ram pressure confinement from the inflowing cloud where also considered . using a simple model for the evolution of a bubble driven by a _ time - dependent wind",
    "_ it was demonstrated that infall ram pressure created a bubble which oscillated or collapsed back onto the star . in this way",
    "wbbs could hydrodynamically collimate jets on the correct scales .",
    "wilkin and stahler ( 1998 ) have applied a quasi - static shell model to hydrodynamic yso collimation .",
    "they find the changes in the geometry of the enviroment will also produce a bipolar outflow .",
    "their timescales for bubble evolution were too long however and they also suggested oscillation via time - dependence in the wind .",
    "we note that frank & mellema separated the issues of launching a wind from collimating it into a jet .",
    "the luminosity associated with low mass stars is too small for produce a radiation driven outflow .",
    "thus the winds from low mass protostars probably require mhd processes .",
    "the collimation of the wind into a narrow jet , however , may require interaction with the environment . for high mass protostars",
    "there is no need to invoke a strong magnetic field to either launch or collimate observed jets / outflows ( shepherd & churchwell 1996 , churchwell 1997 )",
    ". the strong uv flux from massive stars may also play an important role in driving hydrodynamic collimation .",
    "yorke & weltz 1996 and richling & york 1997 have shown that hot material flowing off a ionized accretion disk can effectively constrain a stellar wind .",
    "the gas streams off the disk in those regions where the escape speed is comparable to the sound speed .",
    "these _ thermal disk winds _ can constrain the stellar wind and lead to aspherical wind shocks .",
    "flow focusing of post - shock wind material into a jet occurs in a manner similar to sfic process .",
    "it is likely that mhd processes play a significant role in producing launching many yso jets .",
    "the results presented above however show that the environment needs be considered in models of the collimation process spanning the different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions associated with star formation .",
    "the effect of the environment can also be inferred from observations .",
    "some jets systems show collimation increasing with distance from the source ray ( 1996 ) , an indication the environment is helping narrow the jet as it propagates .",
    "the existence of cavities at the base of some jets has also been observed suggesting the presence of a wider outflow on smaller scales ( close 1997 , cabrit 1996 ) .",
    "the shocks required for hydrodynamic collimation may also be inferred from ionization fractions in jets which tend increase close to the protostellar source ( bacciotti 1997 ) .",
    "evidence of strong non - thermal emission due to shocks exists close to the source of at least one jet system ( reid 1995 , wilner 1997 ) .    *",
    "driving molecular outflows * the second issue connecting yso phenomena to other bipolar outflows is the jet / molecular outflow connection ( cabit 1997 ) .",
    "after almost two decades of study it is still unclear if the yso jets and molecular outflows are causally related or simply co - extensive .",
    "competing models invoke either `` wide - angle wind '' or a jet to drive the molecular outflows .",
    "gwbb scenarios for the origin of the molecular outflows have been invoked since their discovery ( snell , loren & plambeck 1980 , knigl 1992 ) . in shu 1991",
    "a momentum conserving interaction between a gaseous torus and an aspherical central wind was explored .",
    "given a description for the asphericity of the environment , @xmath155 , and the wind , @xmath156 , the shu model allows the shape and speed of the outflow to be simply characterized :    @xmath157    where @xmath158 is the accretion rate and @xmath159 is the sound speed in the infalling gas .",
    "fig 3.5 shows the shape of a wbb formed when a spherical wind expands into a collapsing filament ( delemarter , frank & hartmann 1998 , hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "the alternative sceario holds that molecular outflows are driven not by winds but by fully formed jets .",
    "masson & chernin 1993 explored the ability of straight constant velocity jets to drive molecular outflows via `` prompt entrainment '' at a bow shock .",
    "`` steady entrainment '' jet driven models where outflows result from viscous boundary layers at the jet / ambient - medium interface have also been explored ( raga _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; stahler 1993 ) .",
    "there are two characteristics of molecular outflows that are particularly vexing for either theoretical scenario to explain satisfactorily .",
    "\\1 ) the degree of collimation varies among different objects .",
    "some outflows have been observed to be highly collimated , with length to width ratios of as great as 20:1 .",
    "others are very wide , with this ratio near unity .",
    "\\2 ) the momentum in the outflows is primarily _",
    "forward driven_. this means most of the velocity vectors in the flow are oriented along the long axis of the lobes .    while gwbb models can produce wide outflow lobes they have difficulty producing the correct momentum distribution in the lobes .",
    "if the molecular outflows are formed as `` energy conserving '' wbbs the forward - driven characterstics would be difficult to achieve ( masson & chernin 1993 ) .",
    "in such a case the lobes would be inflated by the pressure of shocked stellar wind material . since thermal pressure always acts normal to the surface of the lobe significant velocities transverse to the axis of the lobe should be observed .",
    "observationally these transverse motions would appear as both red and blue shifted velocity components from _ each _ lobe of a bipolar outflow .",
    "studies of molecular outflows , however , have not revealed the presence of transverse motions . in general ,",
    "blue ( red ) shifted material dominates in the blue ( red ) shifted bipolar lobe .",
    "a recent study by lada & fich ( 1995 ) emphasized this point as their observations of ngc 2064 g reveal 20:1 ratios of blue to red - shifted gas in the blue lobe .",
    "even momentum conserving models shu 1991 would have difficulty producing strong forward driven flows .",
    "masson & chernin 1992 examined the observational consequences of the shu 1992 momentum conserving wbb model .",
    "they found that unless extreme distributions for @xmath160 and @xmath161 were adopted , the model failed to recover the line profiles and momentum distributions observed in molecular outflows . on the other hand calculations by li & shu ( 1996 ) have shown that magnetized clouds can collapse to form dense toroids providing very steep @xmath160 distributions .",
    "the `` wide angle '' flows produced by the x - wind model also producestrongly focused @xmath161 distributions . together the x - wind and collapsed magnetized clouds models may make the gwbb scenario more effective .",
    "jet driven outflow models of molecular outflows have thier own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "jets can produce the correct `` forward driven '' momentum distribution better than wide angle winds however they have difficulty explaining the different degrees of outflow collimation .",
    "masson & chernin ( 1993 ) and chernin & masson ( 1995 ) have suggested that wandering or precessing jets may produce outflows which fit the observational constraints . in the wandering jet model",
    "the jet head drives different parts of the ambient cloud as the propagation direction changes .",
    "both cliffe , frank & jones ( 1996 ) and suttner ( 1997 ) have demonstrated that precessing jets will in fact produce a wide global bow shock enveloping the entire `` corkscrew '' of the jet ( biro & raga 1994 ) . if this global bow shock structure can be identified with molecular outflows it may allow jet driven models to recover the spectrum of outflow shapes as the result of different `` wandering '' angles .",
    "velocity variations ( raga & cabrit 1993 ) in the beam have also been used as a means for widening jet driven outflows . in these models",
    "the bow shock is inflated via pressure from gas``squirted '' out the sides of internal shocks .",
    "finally it should be noted that the shu 1994 x wind model is distinctive in that the jets are actually an optical illusion due to density stratification in a wide angle winds .",
    "such a model has advantages when considering the need to create both jets and molecular outflows .",
    "the studies reviewed in this paper demonstrate bipolar outflow formation is a common process associated with stellar evolution . moreover , the similarieties between structural components of the outflows from low and high mass , evolved and young stars would seem to imply that similar processes shape them all . such an implication is still open to debate however and it is useful to briefly consider what outflows at different ends of the evolution and mass spectrum have in common .",
    "bipolar outflows from evolved stars share many properties .",
    "wide - lobed bipolar planetary nebulae ( pne ) , luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) nebulae and supernova 1987a are quite similar in both their kinematics and shape . given what is already understood about mass loss from these stars the generalized wind blown bubble paradigm seems an approprate approach for describing the formation of bipolar outflows in many these stars .",
    "the existence of non - axisymmetric features in some bubbles however argues that this model requires either additional inputs ( ionization effects , clumpy flows hartquist & dyson 1996 , etc . ) or a move to mhd scearios .",
    "the relation between bipolar outflows in evolved stars and young stellar objects is more complicated . in ysos",
    "the outflows are most likely associated with accretion disks . while low mass stars would not be able to produce any form of outflow without a strong magnetic field ,",
    "high mass ysos may not require magnetic fields to launch or collimate winds .",
    "the presence of long narrow jets _ and _ bipolar outflows presents a twin challenge for theories which might link evolved and young stellar systems .",
    "as we have seen gwbb models can produce both extended outflows and narrow jets but it is not clear if it can produce both simultaneously .",
    "recent studies of pne and proto - pne revealing the presence of jets in evolved stars systems offer the hope of finding links betweeb evolved staroutflows and ysos .",
    "pne jets often bear strinking resembelnce to those in yso often appearing as smaller , shorter versions hh systems and displaying similar point - symmetric shapes .",
    "for some of these systems hydrodynamic collimation models may work quite well ( dopita 1996 ) .",
    "in others the magnetized wind bubble scenario may be more attractive alternative .",
    "the suggestion that accreation disks form in binary agb systems ( livio & soker 1994 ) provides yet another potential link between evolved and yso bipolar outflows .    along with physical processes",
    "different classes of bipolar outflows are connected by the tools and methodology used to study them .",
    "both observational diagnostics / techniques and numerical models can often be readily adapted between different classes of outflow . in some cases the types of questions that can be asked are identical .",
    "for example the study of lbv nebula has led to questions about the geometry of the fast stellar wind which can be answered by examination of the mass and momentum distributions in the bipolar lobes .",
    "such a procedure was used by masson & chernin 1992 in their examined of the wbb model of yso molecular outflows .",
    "given their ubiquity what do bipolar outflows teach us about stellar evolution ? one of the most compelling reasons for studying outflows is the stellar history encoded in their structure .",
    "the outflows trace the history of mass loss in the star . for systems where",
    "the succesive wind phases form extended circumstellar evelopes , the bipolar outflows can provide clues to evolutionary changes in @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "for some systems the structure of the outflows can reveal properties of the pre - existing environment .",
    "thus the outflows can teach us about the history and physics of the stars themselves .    the high quality of observational data available combined with the variety of `` lookback '' timescales ( @xmath28 , equation [ bas ] ) inherent to the outflows ( @xmath162 ) offers the possibilty that key transitions in an individual star s history might be recovered if we learn where and how to look . the use of collimated outflows as fossils can succeed if researchers can identify issues which provide a reasonably unique and unambiguous bridges between nebular stucture / dynamics and stellar evolution .",
    "the development of nebular palentological studies is still in its infancy .",
    "researchers have , however , learned enough that one can point to examples of what such a investigation might look like .",
    "sn87a and @xmath0 carinae are both unique objects . in each case",
    "the intense scrutiny the outflows have received has allowed their histories and the history of the central stars to be specfied in some detail .",
    "there are so many pne and ysos that a similar critical mass of data has not accumulated around many of these objects as of yet .",
    "the nebula surrounding sn87a is a particularly good example to consider .",
    "the properties of the central ring are known with enough accuracy that gwbb models can place strong constraints on the mass loss rates of both the blue supergiant and red supergaint winds .",
    "assuming that the upper and lower rings are associated with the bipolar lobes then the geometry of red supergaint wind and the equator to pole density contrast can also be constrained .",
    "this , in turn , leads to some limitation on the stellar rotation rate and the potential properties of a binary companion .",
    "new studies of the extended circumstellar environment reveal a mild aspherical geometry on with lookback timescales of @xmath163 ( crotts & heathcote 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible that these data may provide futher evidence of evolution of rotation and binary interactions . while many of the conclusions rely on the application of specfic models ( gwbb , wind compressed disks ) , as research progresses one would expect alternative models to be explored with as much detail .",
    "the studies of @xmath0 carinae have also allowed the history of the enigmatic central star to be sketched out .",
    "the expansion patterns of the lobes clearly link them to the outburst of 1843 .",
    "the attention focused on the equatorial ejecta however allows very different models for the history and geometry of the pre - outburst , outburst , and post - outburst winds to examined in detail .",
    "it should also be possible to link the strutures which mottle the surface of the homunculus to instabilites dependant upon the the form of @xmath164 and @xmath165    with these examples it is not unresonable to expect that progress in bipolar outflows studies will someday allow the evolution of fundemental stellar properties to be read off the outflows .",
    "the effect of mass loss , rotation , magnetic fields , and binary companions on stellar birth and death are all questions of fundemental importance .",
    "the rapid progress being made in bipolar outflow studies will produce insights not only into hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic phenomena in general but also provide direct links from the physics of these nebulae to the properties of the stellar sources .",
    "taken together these prospects will make the study of bipolar outflows an exciting field for years to come .",
