    "very recently , the icecube collaboration famously announced the discovery of extraterrestrial neutrinos , including 3 events with well - measured energies around @xmath4  gev , but notably no events have been observed above about @xmath5  gev  @xcite . at @xmath6  gev ,",
    "one expects to observe a dramatic increase in the event rate for @xmath7 in ice due to the `` glashow resonance '' in which greatly increases the interaction cross section  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the detection effective area for @xmath7 at the resonant energy is about 12 times that of off - resonance ( @xmath8 ) events .",
    "this implies that the falling power law of the incident neutrino spectrum ( @xmath9 ) is effectively cancelled and that resonant @xmath7 events could have been seen  @xcite .",
    "various candidate source models have been proposed to explain the icecube energy spectrum  @xcite . in these models",
    "neutrinos originate dominantly in the decay of pions , kaons , and secondary muons produced by ( photo)hadronic interactions .",
    "consequently , the expectation for the relative fluxes of each neutrino flavor at production in the cosmic sources , ( @xmath10 ) , is nearly @xmath11 .",
    "after neutrino oscillations decohere over the astronomical propagation distances the flavor conversion is properly described by the mean oscillation probability . as a result , the flux of `` pionic '' cosmic neutrinos should arrive at earth with democratic flavor ratios , @xmath12 .",
    "if this were the case , then only 1/6 of the total neutrino flux would be subject to the enhancement at the glashow resonance .",
    "this relaxes the physical significance of the apparent cutoff .",
    "the obvious question to ask is whether the flavor ratio @xmath13 is supported by the data .",
    "the icecube event topologies have been classified as muon tracks and showers .",
    "the full 988-day sample contains 37 veto - passing events ( 9 tracks and 28 showers ) with deposited energies in the range @xmath14 . taken at face value the @xmath15 track - to shower ratio appears consistent with the canonical @xmath13 .",
    "however , this is not the case when the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds are properly accounted for .",
    "the expected background from atmospheric muons is @xmath16 and that from atmospheric neutrinos is @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "altogether , the background expectation for tracks is about @xmath18 events , suggesting that the cosmic component overwhelmingly produces showers inside the detector . for an unbroken power law energy spectrum with @xmath19",
    ", a recent statistical analysis indicates that the @xmath13 ratio is disfavored at the 92% c.l .",
    "the constraint is lessened by the softer spectra favored by the most recent icecube data  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a spectrum @xmath20 , the @xmath13 flavor ratio is disfavored at 86% c.l .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the possible deficit of muon tracks ( as well as the apparent energy gap between @xmath21  @xcite ) is due to some non - standard physics which favors earthly ratios nearly @xmath22 , e.g. , neutrino decay  @xcite , cpt violation  @xcite , pseudo - dirac neutrinos  @xcite , enhancement of neutrino - quark scattering by a leptoquark that couples to the @xmath23-flavor and light quarks  @xcite , sterile neutrino altered dispersion relations due to shortcuts in extra dimensions  @xcite , and exotic very - soft interactions of cosmogenic neutrinos  @xcite . in this note",
    "we provide a more mundane explanation , in which a @xmath24 flux of antineutrinos originates via neutron @xmath0-decay  @xcite .",
    "the typical energy for the @xmath7 in the lab is that of the parent neutron times @xmath25 ( the @xmath26-value for @xmath0-decay is @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , to produce pev antineutrinos we require a flux of eev neutrons .",
    "herein we show that to accommodate icecube observations it is necessary that only about 1% to 10% of the emitted cosmic rays in the energy decade @xmath28 , yielding antineutrinos on earth ( @xmath29 ) , are observed .",
    "such a strong suppression can be explained assuming magnetic shielding of the secondary protons which diffuse in extragalactic magnetic fields of strength @xmath2 and coherence length @xmath3 . before proceeding ,",
    "we explore the required assumptions on parameters characterizing the neutron - emitting - sources ( nes ) .",
    "we assume that the production of neutrons and photons by cosmic ray accelerators is a consequence of photo - disintegration of high - energy nuclei , followed by immediate photo - emission from the excited daughter nuclei . by far the largest contribution to",
    "the photo - excitation cross section comes from the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) at @xmath30 in the nuclear rest frame .",
    "the ambient photon energy required to excite the gdr is therefore @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the boost factor of the nucleus ( of mass number @xmath33 and charge @xmath34 ) in the lab .",
    "the gdr decays by the statistical emission of a single nucleon , leaving an excited daughter nucleus .",
    "the probability for emission of two ( or more ) nucleons is smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "the excited daughter nuclei typically de - excite by emitting one or more photons of energies @xmath35  mev in the nuclear rest frame .",
    "the lab - frame energy of the @xmath36-ray is then @xmath37 . to produce neutrons in the energy range of interest",
    "we require a thermal photon background in the far infrared , @xmath38 .",
    "there are two channels other than photo - disintegration that might contribute to @xmath36-ray and neutrino production",
    ". these are photo - hadronic ( @xmath39 ) and pure hadronic ( @xmath40 ) interactions . in both cases , @xmath36-rays ( neutrinos )",
    "are produced after @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) decays ; neutrinos carry on average @xmath44 of the initial cosmic ray energy per nucleon . to avoid overproduction of neutrinos in the eev energy range",
    "we assume that collisions of the relativistic nuclei with the cold ambient interstellar medium are strongly suppressed , due to an extremely low gas density .",
    "photo - meson production has a very high energy threshold , being only relevant for very high energetic beams or in very hot photon environments . even in these extreme cases ,",
    "the fact that this reaction turns on at so high energies implies that the photons and neutrinos from decaying pions are produced at very high energies too .",
    "the energy threshold for gdr excitation is more than one order of magnitude below the threshold for photopion production , @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in the energy decade of interest ( @xmath46 ) our choice of source parameters automatically suppresses photo - meson production .",
    "though all cosmic rays experiments point to a dominance of protons below the `` ankle '' of the cosmic ray spectrum ( that is @xmath47 , there is a significant disagreement in interpretation of depth of shower maximum measurements above this energy , with hires  @xcite and ta  @xcite preferring nearly pure protons and auger  @xcite preferring a transition to heavies",
    ". to remain consistent with the non - observation of events at the glashow resonance , the contribution to the cosmic ray flux from nes can not extend beyond @xmath48 .",
    "this maximum energy is not inconsistent with the maximum observed energies if one assumes ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are heavy nuclei , e.g. , for iron nuclei @xmath49 . in the scenario envisaged here neutron emission from nuclei",
    "photo - disintegration dominates the spectrum below the ankle .",
    "the steeply falling neutron spectrum is overtaken by the harder proton spectrum above about @xmath50 , where the escape of charged particles becomes efficient .",
    "these overlapping spectra could then carve the ankle into the spectrum . the spectrum above the ankle exhibits a progressive transition to heavy nuclei , as @xmath51 reaches the proton escape energy .",
    "if , on the other hand , the observed spectrum is dominated by protons above the ankle , we should then assume that there are two different types of sources contributing below and above the ankle  @xcite .",
    "this in turn provides a simple interpretation of the break in the spectrum ; namely , a new population of sources emerges which dominates the more steeply falling nes population .",
    "we turn to the calculation . compared to cosmic distances",
    ", the decay of even the boosted neutron may be taken as nearly instantaneous .",
    "therefore , the basic formula that relates the neutron flux at the sources to the antineutrino flux observed at earth @xmath52 is  @xcite :    @xmath53 , \\label{nuflux}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the antineutrino and neutron energies in the lab , @xmath56 is the antineutrino angle with respect to the direction of the neutron momentum in the neutron rest - frame , and @xmath57 is the antineutrino energy in the neutron rest - frame . the last three variables are not observed by a laboratory neutrino - detector , and so are integrated over",
    ". the observable @xmath58 is held fixed .",
    "the delta - function relates the neutrino energy in the lab to the three integration variables , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lorentz factor and as usual @xmath61 is the particle s velocity in units of @xmath62 . here",
    ", @xmath63 is the neutron emissivity , defined as the mean number of particles emitted per co - moving volume per unit time per unit energy as measured at the source . in general",
    ", the emissivity may evolve and so depend on time or redshift , but we will ignore this here .",
    "we sum the sources out to the edge of the universe at distance @xmath64 ( note that an @xmath65 in the volume sum is compensated by the usual @xmath66 fall - off of flux per source ) .",
    "finally , @xmath67 is the normalized probability that the decaying neutron produces a @xmath7 with energy @xmath68 in the neutron rest - frame .",
    "note that the maximum @xmath7 energy in the neutron rest frame is very nearly @xmath26 and the minimum @xmath7 energy is zero in the massless limit . for the decay of unpolarized neutrons",
    ", there is no angular dependence in @xmath67 .    performing the @xmath69 -integration in ( [ nuflux ] ) over the delta - function constraint leads to @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "an approximate answer is available if we take the @xmath0decay as a @xmath73 process of @xmath74 in which the antineutrino is produced mono - energetically in the rest frame , with @xmath75  mev , where @xmath76  mev is the neutron - proton mass difference . setting the beta - decay neutrino energy @xmath68 equal to its mean value @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 . in the lab ,",
    "the ratio of the maximum @xmath7 energy to the neutron energy is @xmath79 and so the boosted @xmath7 s have a spectrum with @xmath80 when the delta - function is substituted into ( [ nuflux2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the neutron energy from a photo - disintegrated nucleus at threshold .- dependence .",
    "this could influence the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum around @xmath84 , where a spectral feature called the `` second knee '' has been reported . ]    next we must relate @xmath85 to an observable .",
    "establishing a connection between the secondary flux of protons @xmath86 and the neutron emissivity is really simple because the @xmath0-protons , with energies @xmath87 , travel undeterred through the universal radiation backgrounds permeating the universe .",
    "however , it is possible that some protons are shielded by the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "this will restrict the number of contributing sources to the cosmic ray spectrum . including here energy red - shifting by @xmath88",
    ", we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a suppression factor defined as the ratio of the observed flux to the one that would be obtained for a continuous source distribution without magnetic shielding .",
    "the two observables in ( [ ndk ] ) and ( [ protons ] ) , @xmath0-antineutrino and proton spectra at earth , are related by the common source .",
    "the relation is made explicit by assuming a functional form for @xmath91 .",
    "if we assume a power law with index @xmath92 , as shown in  @xcite the integrals are easily done . for @xmath93",
    ", we obtain @xmath94 \\ , \\ \\frac{df_{\\rm cr } ( e_{\\rm        th}^{\\rm gdr})}{de_{\\rm       cr } } \\ , , \\label{znz}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 on the other hand , for @xmath96 , the @xmath97 spectrum is flat @xmath98 because all the free neutrons have sufficient energy , @xmath99 , to contribute equally to all the @xmath7 energy bins below @xmath100 .",
    "taking @xmath101 as a reasonable example ( [ znz ] ) yields @xmath102 substituting the observational value  @xcite , @xmath103 into ( [ quecagada ] ) and comparing it with the energy square weighted flux reported by the icecube collaboration , @xmath104  @xcite , we require @xmath105 to accommodate our proposal",
    ".    the propagation of cosmic ray protons in the extragalactic magnetic field would be diffusive if the distance from the source(s ) to earth is much larger than the scattering length .",
    "depending on the magnetic field strength and diffusion length , a significant fraction of the `` emitted '' protons can have trajectory lengths comparable to the hubble radius @xmath64 .",
    "however , if the average separation between the sources ( @xmath106 ) in a uniform distribution is much smaller than the characteristic propagation length scales due to diffusion and energy loss , the observed cosmic ray flux will be the same as that obtained for a continuous distribution of sources in the absence of magnetic field effects  @xcite .",
    "in other words , even at energies for which faraway sources do not contribute , as long as the observer lies within the diffusion sphere of the nearby sources the spectrum is unchanged .",
    "on the other hand , the flux of protons would be suppressed if _ ( i ) _ particles are unable to reach the earth from faraway sources and _ ( ii ) _ particles take a much longer time to arrive from the nearby sources than they would following rectilinear propagation .",
    "it is therefore important to study in detail the suppression effect on the closest sources .    following  @xcite we assume diffusion in a random @xmath107-field with maximum coherent length @xmath108 .",
    "this assumption yields two different propagation regimes depending on the relation between the larmor radius @xmath109 and the coherence length .",
    "the transition energy between these two regimes , @xmath110 , is determined by the condition yielding @xmath111 . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the suppression factor can be approximated by @xmath113 \\",
    ", , \\label{efe}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figura ] we show three illustrative examples for which the required range of the value of @xmath90 can be easily entertained .",
    "the approximation in ( [ efe ] ) assumes the magnetic field power to be distributed homogeneously in space . for inhomogeneous extragalactic magnetic fields , the parameters in ( [ efe ] ) vary significantly depending on the strength of magnetic fields in the voids of the large scale structure distribution , which is subject to large uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "we note that further suppression of the cosmic ray flux can be obtained if some neutrons decay inside the source , resulting in protons which remain trapped until attaining the escape energy .",
    "next , we estimate the @xmath36-ray flux produced when the photo - dissociated nuclear fragments de - excite .",
    "these @xmath36-rays create chains of electromagnetic cascades on the microwave and infrared backgrounds , resulting in a transfer of the initial energy into the so - called _",
    "fermi_-lat region , which is bounded by observation  @xcite to not exceed @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we can finesse the details of the calculation by arguing in analogy to the work already done .",
    "the photo - disintegration chain produces one @xmath0-decay antineutrino with energy of order 0.55  mev in the nuclear rest frame , for each neutron produced  @xcite . multiplying this result by 2 to include photo - disintegration to protons in addition to neutrons",
    "correctly weights the number of steps in the chain .",
    "each step produces on average one photon with energy @xmath120  mev in the nuclear rest frame . in comparison ,",
    "about 12 times more energy is deposited into photons . including the factor of 12 relating @xmath121 to @xmath122",
    ", we find from ( [ quecagada ] ) that the photo - disintegration / de - excitation energy emitted in @xmath36-rays , @xmath123 , is below the _ fermi_-lat bound .",
    "is just the area under the @xmath124 versus @xmath125 curve  @xcite . ]",
    "the analysis described here is subject to several caveats .",
    "we have ignored effects of energy red - shifting of the neutrino and possible source evolution .",
    "a more careful analysis would yield in ( [ nuflux ] ) an additional factor : @xmath126 .",
    "will reduce the energy of protons and neutrinos by about 50% and at @xmath127 by about 30% .",
    "if one includes @xmath128 production the energy of the protons will be reduced by about 5% at @xmath129 ; see fig .  3 of  @xcite .",
    "given that protons lose energy during propagation scattering off the radiation fields while neutrinos do not , the value of @xmath90 should in fact be somewhat larger than computed in the analysis presented here . additionally calculating @xmath90",
    "precisely requires knowledge of the source evolution .",
    "] we have assumed that not only the nuclei undergoing acceleration remained magnetically trapped in the source , but also the secondary protons released in the photo - disintegration process .",
    "this may decrease @xmath90 by a factor of about 2 .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the picture outlined above is driven by the canonical fermi index of @xmath130 . for @xmath131 ,",
    "@xmath90 is reduced by a factor of five and for @xmath132 , @xmath90 is reduced by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "given the current level of uncertainties on the source evolution and the magnetic horizon , shifting our assumed spectral index from @xmath130 to @xmath133 will have little impact on the arguments concerning energetics explored herein . in the future , improved measurements all - round will require a considerably more elaborate analysis , including detailed numerical simulations .",
    "it is worth commenting on an additional interesting aspect of this analysis .",
    "note that @xmath100 can be shifted to lower energies by considering a thermal photon background in the near infrared , @xmath134 .",
    "since the cosmic ray spectrum @xmath135 is softer than the neutrino spectrum @xmath136  @xcite , the source energetics discussed herein would also easily accommodate the recently proposed _ two - component _ flux model  @xcite , in which a steeply falling flux of electron antineutrinos populates the `` low - energy '' range of the cosmic neutrino spectrum observed by icecube , and is overtaken at `` high energy '' by a population of neutrinos produced through pion decay with a harder spectrum .",
    "we have presented a model that can accommodate the apparent deficit of muon tracks in icecube data without the need of invoking unknown physics .",
    "the model seems unnaturally fine - tuned as it would be more likely for neutrinos to originate from pion decay ; in particular , the energetics requirement would be more easy to satisfy",
    ". however , nature is often more subtle than we might like and all options should be considered . in particular , if the significance of the muon deficit increases as icecube collects more data the model presented here will gather plausibility .",
