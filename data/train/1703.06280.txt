    "non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) or strange metal phase is often observed to precede many correlated phases , such as antiferro- or ferromagnetism , and unconventional superconductivity.@xcite it is characterized by deviation from the well - defined fermi - liquid ( fl ) predictions , such as the resistivity - temperature exponent ( @xmath1 ) being @xmath51 , while @xmath6 is expected from the fl theory .",
    "systematic studies in various superconducting families have also revealed that superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) increases as the exponent @xmath1 decreases , i.e. , as the system deviates farther from the fl behavior.@xcite therefore , nfl state is considered an important problem towards the understanding of unconventional superconductivity .    in the phase diagram , nfl state",
    "is often seen to arise near the boundary between an order phase and the fl state , where superconductivity is optimized.@xcite yet , considerable counter - examples are also present where a nfl phase is present without a quantum phase transition@xcite or superconductivity.@xcite therefore , it has remained a ` chicken - and - egg ' type problem whether a quantum critical point drives the nfl state or vice versa , and how they conspire into superconductivity .    to definitely answer this issue",
    ", one can approach the nfl state from the fl regime .",
    "the transition from the fl to nfl state is very adiabatic , i.e , the resistivity exponent @xmath1 _ continuously _ changes from 2 ( fl ) to 1 or even below 1 in the nfl state at a given temperature .",
    "theoretical models , relying on either critical fluctuations,@xcite or marginal fluctuations,@xcite or other quantum fields,@xcite predict that when quantum fluctuations become gapless ( critical ) , the low - energy excitation spectrum becomes linear in energy in the entire brillouin zone ( bz ) , and the quasiparticle description fully breaks down . in such a case , the transport relaxation rate behaves as @xmath7 , giving a linear resistivity exponent ( @xmath1 = 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak correlation in the fl regime gives a quadratic energy dependence of the excitations , and the corresponding low - energy quasiparticles produce @xmath6 .",
    "model descriptions thus treat these regimes separately , and often unable to reconcile the adiabatic crossover between the fl to nfl states within a unified , self - consistent framework.@xcite    here we present a theory of the nfl phenomena arising from the _ momentum _ dependent self - energy due to canonical density - density fluctuations .",
    "the many - body self - energy is calculated based on the momentum - resolved density - fluctuation ( mrdf ) model within the fluctuation - exchange approximation.@xcite the method is known to be appropriate for the intermediate coupling region where quantum fluctuations are of the order of the kinetic energy , stipulating a dynamically frustrated system .",
    "we apply the result in various cuprate materials .",
    "we find that the dominant source of the nfl state stems from large degeneracy in the quasiparticle density .",
    "the nfl strength is incipiently controlled by the position of the dos degeneracy from the fermi level ( @xmath8 ) as well as its occupied momentum space volume ( i.e. the amount of degeneracy ) at a given condition",
    ". one of our key results is that even in the extreme nfl state where @xmath91 ( near the optimal doping in cuprates ) , not all electronic states in the bz become incoherent .",
    "conversely , in the fl state ( in overdoped region ) , not all quasiparticles are necessarily long - lived .",
    "this can be understood from the behavior of the @xmath0-dependent self - energy @xmath10 , allowing a @xmath0-dependent exponent @xmath11 .",
    "we find that @xmath11 strongly varies in the bz : the high - density region ( ` hot - spots ' ) governs @xmath12 , while the low - density region ( ` cold - spots ' ) gives @xmath13 .",
    "this allows a coexistence and competition between the nfl and fl physics in the same system .",
    "the spectral weight transfer between the ` hot- ' and ` cold - spots ' , caused by doping , temperature , and other parameters , manifests into an adiabatic transition between the fl and the nfl state .",
    "the results are applicable to a wider class of correlated materials in which large density of states is caused by van - hove singularity ( vhs ) , or liftshitz points ( as in pnictides ) , spin - orbit couping ( in heavy - fermions and actinides ) and leads to strong anisotropic self - energy effects .    we also make direct comparison with corresponding experiments . a recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    "experiment also observed a similar @xmath0-dependence in the electronic life - time in la - based cuprate.@xcite it was found that the inverse of the quasiparticle lifetime changes from quadratic to linear as we move from nodal to the antinodal region , even in the overdoped sample where the transport data suggest a simple fl behavior .",
    "again , angle - dependent magnetoresistance ( admr ) measurements on overdoped tl - based cuprate also exhibited the similar behavior , in that the scattering rate becomes quadratic to linear - in-@xmath14 as we moves from the nodal to the antinodal region of the sample.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the robustness of the results against the value of the hubbard interaction @xmath15 is demonstrated in the appendix  [ apx : u ] .",
    "cuprate is a prototype of correlated superconducting family where the interplay between nfl , unconventional superconductivity , and various intertwined orders leads to a complex doping dependent phase diagram ( see fig .  [ fig1]).@xcite yet , the band structure is rather straightforward with a single and strongly anisotropic band passing through the fermi level .",
    "we consider a realistic band structure including upto fourth order tight - binding hoppings ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) as @xmath20 . the second nearest neighbor hopping @xmath21 has a special importance in cuprates as it controls the flatness of the band near @xmath22 and its equivalent points .",
    "this generates paramount degeneracy in the doss at the vhs position .",
    "interestingly , an earlier density functional theory ( dft ) calculation demonstrated that the optimal @xmath4 in different cuprates scales almost linearly with the corresponding @xmath23 ratio.@xcite it is also known that the energy of the vhs in a given system moves closer to the fermi level with increasing doping , and crosses it in the vicinity of the optimal doping , see fig .",
    "these results give an important clue that the density fluctuation driven nfl is concentrated at the vhs region , while the other parts of the bz continue to be fl - like .",
    "their competition is controlled by chemical potential ( doping ) and @xmath21 ( materials , pressure ) .",
    "the density fluctuations dominate in the magnetic channel , giving paramagnon excitations in cuprates .",
    "these excitations are strongly dispersive , and present at all dopings.@xcite the coupling between density fluctuations and electrons gives rise to a complex self - energy , which can be calculated in a variety of numerical techniques.@xcite here we invoke a self - consistent momentum - resolved density fluctuation ( mrdf ) technique@xcite which is suitable for the intermediate coupling regime where kinetic energy and dynamical correlations are comparable .",

    "admr technique has the ability to probe the angle - variation of the resistivity by tilting the magnetic field with the sample orientation .",

    "an earlier admr study on overdoped tl@xmath72ba@xmath72cuo@xmath73 found that @xmath74 varies as @xmath75 in the nodal region ( @xmath76 ) and it gradually changes to @xmath14 in the antinodal region ( @xmath77).@xcite this result is consistent with out finding of quasiparticle life - time variation shown in fig .",
    "note that even the overall resistivity exponent is close to 2 in the overdoped region , however , its local variation reveals that both the single - particle life - time and scattering rate consistently remains incoherent in the antinodal region .",
    "the celebrated paper by pavarini _ et al._@xcite pointed out an intriguing relationship between the @xmath78 ratio obtained in different materials with their @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath78 triggers higher degeneracy in the dos ( see appendix b3 ) , and hence it is natural to expect that the strength of the nfl state would also increase .",
    "we calculate the resistivity exponent @xmath1 for different values of @xmath23 by fixing the vhs at the @xmath79 , and the result is plotted in fig .",
    "indeed , we find that with increasing @xmath23 , @xmath1 decreases , that means , the system becomes more nfl like .",
    "with increasing @xmath78 , both the dos at vhs increases and the bandwidth decreases ( see appendix b3 ) , and thus the nfl phenomena also increases .",
    "it is already known that the optimal @xmath4 increases with increasing @xmath23,@xcite and with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , it is also observed that as @xmath1 decreases , the residual resistivity , @xmath80 as @xmath81 , also decreases , and @xmath4 increases .",
    "this phenomena is consistently observed in various cuprates , pnictides and heavy - fermions.@xcite our results thus give the microscopic insight into this empirical observation .",
    "finally , we discuss various other phenomena in cuprates and their impact on our conclusions .",
    "the doping dependence of the dynamical correlation is different from that of the static correlation .",
    "the dynamical correlation , arising from the density fluctuation is determined by the strength of degeneracy ( here vhs ) .",
    "it becomes dominant near the optimal doping where the vhs lies at @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "static correlation is determined by the onsite coulomb interaction ( @xmath15 in eq .  ) and it gives rise to a mott insulator state at half - filling . while the static correlation decreases with doping , kinetic frustration increases and becomes maximum near the optimal doping at the vhs point .",
    "kinetic frustration also introduces other competing phases such as antiferromagnetism , charge - density wave order , and other orders , and can modify the results in the underdoped region . yet , without including any order parameter or quantum critical point , we get a good , quantitative agreement between the theory and experiment in the entire doping regime , suggesting that the dominant nfl physics stems from the df fluctuations in these systems .",
    "we have also studied all the results presented here for different values of @xmath15 , and shown that the momentum profile of @xmath11 , doping dependence of @xmath1 etc .",
    "remain the same for different values of @xmath15 , except that their overall strength decreases with decreasing @xmath15 , i.e. , the system moves towards fl - like as static correlation decreases .",
    "the fl state is recovered in the weak - coupling region ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the important message of our result is that for strongly anisotropic materials where the dynamical fluctuations have significant momentum dependence , the resistivity - temperature exponent is not a robust measure of the full correlation spectrum of the underlying quasiparticle states .",
    "we found that even in the underdoped and overdoped regions , where resistivity exponent n@xmath822 , there are considerable amount of nfl - like incoherent states lying in the antinodal regions and vice versa .",
    "similarly , in the extreme nfl region near the optimal doping regime ( determined by n@xmath51 ) , the nodal quasiparticles continue to behave fl - like ( with @xmath83 ) . both as a function of temperature and doping ( and other tunnings )",
    ", the spectral weight is transfered between the nfl and fl regions and the system adiabatically transforms from a dominant nfl to a fl - like state , as seen in experiments .",
    "our work suggests that the microscopic and macroscopic landscapes of the nfl behavior can be characteristically different and that a direct correspondence between @xmath0-resolved spectroscopy ( such as arpes , and quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) pattern ) and the transport , and thermodynamical properties are necessary to deduce the global and local nfl behavior of a given system",

    "we find that both the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath11 increases with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "in addition we also notice that the @xmath0-space area of the nfl region ( @xmath861 ) also decreases with decreasing @xmath15 , reflecting that the system moves towards fl as correlation weakens .",

    "[ figb3 ] .",

    "therefore , the system becomes more nfl - like as @xmath78 increases .",
    "this conclusion remains intact as we tune the values of @xmath15 . for different values of @xmath15 , the general trend in @xmath1 with @xmath78",
    "remains the same , however the overall range of @xmath1 increases with decreasing @xmath15 as we also found in figs .",
    "[ figb1 ] and [ figb2 ] before .",
    "we start with the standard definition of spin / charge susceptibility @xcite which is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the spin / charge density where indices i , j denote different components ( for example x , y , z components ) in case of spin susceptibility . charge and spin densities @xmath89",

    "@xmath92 is the dressed quasi - particle creation operator ( sometimes called dyson orbitals ) at bloch momentum @xmath50 and spin @xmath93 .",
    "since the ground state is spinless , both transverse and longitudinal spin - densities , as well as the charge density term yields the same bare susceptibility .",
    "in general , we can write eq .   as @xmath94 where the momentum conservation is imposed .",
    "we can decompose the four - field terms into bi - linear terms within wick s theorem , and allow the spin - conservation condition for the ground state .",
    "then we obtain , @xmath95 where we have identified the terms in the brackets as self - energy dressed green s functions such as @xmath96 the fourier transform of green s function is defined as @xmath97 and that of the susceptibility as @xmath98 here @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequencies , respectively .",
    "finally , we get @xmath101 from here onwards we drop the index @xmath93 and assume an implied sum over @xmath93 index .",

    "<S> non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) state represents an ensemble of incoherent quantum fluids arising from the coupling between electrons and massless ( critical ) excitations , and is separated by phase boundary from the quasiparticle behavior in the fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that such sharp distinction breaks down in cuprates , and that both nfl and fl states coexists in different momentum ( @xmath0 ) regions at all dopings . </S>",
    "<S> their coexistence originates from the strong anisotropy in the many - body self - energy , arising from dispersive density - density fluctuations . the self - energy attains maxima ( nfl - like ) in the region where density degeneracy is optimum ( antinodal region ) , while the nodal region remains fl - like at all dopings . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the global nfl / fl behavior via the calculation of the resistivity - temperature exponent ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that the entire brillouin zone becomes neither fully incoherent , nfl - like even at optimal doping with @xmath2 , nor fully fl - like even at overdoping ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as density degeneracy increases in different materials with increasing superconducting @xmath4 , @xmath1 decreases ; providing a microscopic explanation to this intriguing relationship . </S>",
    "<S> all results , including coexistence of nfl- and fl - self - energies in the @xmath0-space , and their doping , materials dependencies are compared with available experimental data , followed by definite predictions for future studies . </S>"
