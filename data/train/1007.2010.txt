    "this paper outlines a study of the non - abelian theta functions that arise in chern - simons theory by adapting the method used by andr weil for studying classical theta functions @xcite .",
    "we discuss the case of the gauge group @xmath0 , which is important because it corresponds to the witten - reshetikhin - turaev topological quantum field theory , and hence is related to the jones polynomial of knots @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the methods can be applied to more general gauge groups , which will be done in subsequent work .    in weil s",
    "approach , classical theta functions come with an action of the finite heisenberg group and a projective representation of the mapping class group . by analogy ,",
    "our point of view is that the theory of non - abelian theta functions consists of :    @xmath2 the hilbert space of non - abelian theta functions , namely the holomorphic sections of the chern - simons line bundle ;    @xmath2 an irreducible representation on the space of theta functions of the algebra generated by quantized wilson lines ( i.e. of the quantizations of traces of holonomies of simple closed curves ) ;    @xmath2 a projective representation of the mapping class group of the surface on the space of non - abelian theta functions .    the representation of the mapping class group intertwines the quantized wilson lines ; in this sense the two representations satisfy the exact egorov identity .",
    "non - abelian theta functions , quantized wilson lines , and the projective representations of the mapping class groups of surfaces have each been studied separately ; we suggest that they should be studied together .",
    "one should recall one instance when these were considered together : the proof of the asymptotic faithfulness of the reshetikhin - turaev representation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our prototype is the quantization of a one - dimensional particle .",
    "the paradigm is that _ the quantum group quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on a surface and the reshetikhin - turaev representation of the mapping class group are the analogues of the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg group and of the metaplectic representation_. the schrdinger representation arises from the quantization of the position and the momentum of a one - dimensional free particle , and is a consequence of a fundamental postulate in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is a unitary irreducible representation of the heisenberg group , and the stone - von neumann theorem shows that it is unique .",
    "this uniqueness implies that linear changes of coordinates ( which act as outer automorphisms of the heisenberg group ) are also quantizable , and their quantization yields an infinite dimensional representation of the metaplectic group .",
    "weil @xcite observed that a finite heisenberg group acts on classical theta functions , and that the well known hermite - jacobi action of the modular group @xmath3 is induced via a stone - von neumann theorem .",
    "then it was noticed that classical theta functions , the action of the heisenberg group , and of the modular group arise from the weyl quantization of jacobian varieties . as such ,",
    "classical theta functions are the holomorphic sections of a line bundle over the moduli space of flat @xmath4-connections on a surface , and by analogy , the holomorphic sections of the similar line bundle over the moduli space of flat @xmath5-connections over a surface ( where @xmath5 is the lie algebra of a compact simple lie group ) were called non - abelian theta functions .",
    "witten @xcite placed non - abelian theta functions in the context of chern - simons theory , related them to the jones polynomial @xcite and conformal field theory , and gave new methods for studying them .",
    "this had a great impact in the guise of the verlinde formula which computes the dimension of the space of non - abelian theta functions .",
    "we explain how within witten s theory one can find the non - abelian analogues of weil s constructs .",
    "this is done for the group @xmath0 .    because the work joins methods from the theory of theta functions , quantum mechanics , representation theory , and low dimensional topology , we made it as self - contained as possible . at the heart of the paper",
    "lies a comparison between classical theta functions on the jacobian variety of a complex torus and the non - abelian theta functions of the gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "we first review the prototype : the schrdinger and metaplectic representations . then , we recall the necessary facts about classical theta functions from @xcite , just for the case of the torus .",
    "we point out two properties of the finite heisenberg group : the stone - von neumann theorem , and the fact that its group algebra is symmetric with respect to the action of the mapping class group of the torus .",
    "each is responsible for the existence of the hermite - jacobi action by discrete fourier transforms on theta functions .",
    "these properties have non - abelian counterparts , which we reveal later in the paper .",
    "we then rephrase theta functions , the schrdinger representation , and the discrete fourier transform in topological language following @xcite , using skein modules @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fact that skein modules can be used to describe classical theta functions is a corollary of witten s feynman integral approach to the chern - simons theory for the group @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , witten has explained in @xcite that the topological quantum field theory of any lie group gives rise to skein relations , hence it should have a skein theoretic version .",
    "for example , the skein theoretic version for the gauge group @xmath0 was constructed in @xcite .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the skein modules of the abelian theory arise naturally from quantum mechanics , without relying on quantum field theory .",
    "we then recall the construction of non - abelian theta functions from the quantization of the moduli space of flat connections on a surface , and present in detail the case of the torus , where the moduli space is the pillow case .",
    "the paper continues with a description of the quantum group quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on a surface , rephrased into the language of the skein modules .",
    "we deduce that the quantum group quantization is defined by the left action of a skein algebra on a quotient of itself . because we are interested in the multiplicative structure , we use the skein relations of the reshetikhin - turaev invariant instead of those of the kauffman bracket , since the latter introduce sign discrepancies .",
    "we recall our previous result @xcite that on the pillow case , the quantum group and weyl quantizations coincide .",
    "then we prove a stone - von neumann theorem on the pillow case .",
    "an application is to deduce the existence of the reshetikhin - turaev representation on the torus as a consequence of this stone - von neumann theorem .",
    "we show how the explicit formula for this representation can be computed from quantum mechanical considerations . as such we arrive at the element @xmath7 by which one colors knots as to allow kirby moves along them .",
    "this element is the fundamental building block in the construction of quantum @xmath1-manifold invariants ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and we give a natural way to derive its existence .",
    "we conclude by explaining how the reshetikhin - turaev representation of the mapping class group of a surface is a non - abelian analogue of the hermite - jacobi action given by discrete fourier transforms .",
    "in this section we review briefly the schrdinger and the metaplectic representations . for a detailed discussion",
    "we suggest @xcite and @xcite .    in the canonical formalism , a classical mechanical system is described by a symplectic manifold @xmath8 , which is the phase space of the system .",
    "the classical observables are @xmath9 functions on @xmath10 .",
    "to each @xmath11 one associates a hamiltonian vector field @xmath12 on @xmath13 by @xmath14 this vector field defines a hamiltonian flow on the manifold which preserves the form @xmath15 .",
    "the symplectic form defines a poisson bracket by @xmath16 .",
    "there is a special observable @xmath17 , called the hamiltonian ( total energy ) of the system .",
    "the time evolution of an observable is described by the equation @xmath18    quantization replaces the symplectic manifold by a hilbert space , real - valued observables @xmath19 by self - adjoint operators @xmath20 called quantum observables , hamiltonian flows by one - parameter groups of unitary operators , and the poisson bracket of @xmath21 by @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is planck s constant and @xmath24 $ ] is the commutator of operators .",
    "dirac s conditions should hold : @xmath25 and @xmath26+o(\\hbar).\\ ] ] the second condition is phrased by that the quantization is performed in the direction of the poisson bracket .",
    "the time evolution of a quantum observable is described by schrdinger s equation @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a fundamental example is that of a particle in a @xmath28-dimensional space , which we discuss in the case where planck s constant is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the phase space is @xmath29 , with coordinates the position @xmath30 and the momentum @xmath31 , and symplectic form @xmath32 .",
    "the associated poisson bracket is @xmath33 the symplectic form @xmath15 induces a nondegenerate antisymmetric bilinear form on @xmath34 , also denoted by @xmath15 , given by @xmath35 .",
    "the lie algebra of observables has a subalgebra generated by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , called the heisenberg lie algebra .",
    "abstractly , this algebra is defined by @xmath39=e , [ p , e]=[q , e]=0 $ ] .",
    "it is a postulate of quantum mechanics that the quantization of the position , the momentum , and the constant functions is the representation of the heisenberg lie algebra on @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 here @xmath42 denotes the operator of multiplication by the variable : @xmath43 .",
    "this is the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg lie algebra .",
    "the lie group of the heisenberg lie algebra is the heisenberg group .",
    "it is defined as @xmath44 with the multiplication rule @xmath45 it is standard to denote @xmath46 . by exponentiating the schrdinger representation of the lie algebra one obtains the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg group : @xmath47 specifically , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 meaning that @xmath50 acts as a translation , @xmath51 acts as the multiplication by a character , and @xmath52 acts as the multiplication by a scalar .",
    "this is the rule for quantizing exponential functions .",
    "specifically , @xmath53 is the quantization of the function @xmath54 . extending by linearity one obtains the quantization of the group ring of the heisenberg group .",
    "this was further generalized by hermann weyl , who gave a method for quantizing all functions @xmath55 by using the fourier transform @xmath56 and then defining @xmath57 where for @xmath58 he used the schrdinger representation .    * theorem * ( stone - von neumann ) the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg group is the unique irreducible unitary representation of this group such that @xmath52 acts as @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "there are two other important realizations of the irreducible representation that this theorem characterizes .",
    "one comes from the quantization of the plane in a holomorphic polarization .",
    "the hilbert space is the bargmann space , @xmath61    for the other one has to choose a lagrangian subspace @xmath62 of @xmath63 ( which in this case is just a one - dimensional subspace ) .",
    "then @xmath64 is a maximal abelian subgroup of the heisenberg group .",
    "consider the character of this subgroup defined by @xmath65 the hilbert space of the quantization , @xmath66 , is defined as the space of functions @xmath67 on @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 and such that @xmath70 is a square integrable function on the left equivalence classes modulo @xmath71 .",
    "the representation of the heisenberg group is given by @xmath72    if we choose an algebraic complement @xmath73 of @xmath62 , meaning that we write @xmath74 , then @xmath66 can be realized as @xmath75 . under a natural isomorphism , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the standard symplectic form on @xmath63 . for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,",
    "one obtains the standard schrdinger representation in the position representation . for @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "one obtains the schrdinger representation in the momentum representation : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the stone - von neumann theorem implies that if we change coordinates by a linear symplectomorphism and then quantize , we obtain a unitary equivalent representation of the heisenberg group .",
    "hence linear symplectomorphisms can be quantized , giving rise to unitary operators , although they do not arise from hamiltonian flows .",
    "irreducibility implies , by schur s lemma , that these operators are unique up to a multiplication by a constant .",
    "hence we have a projective representation @xmath85 of the linear symplectic group @xmath86 on @xmath87 .",
    "this can be made into a true representation by passing to the double cover of @xmath86 , namely to the metaplectic group @xmath88 .",
    "the representation of the metaplectic group is known as the _ metaplectic representation _ or the segal - shale - weil representation .",
    "the fundamental symmetry that weyl quantization has is that , if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 for every observable @xmath55 , where @xmath20 is the operator associated to @xmath19 through weyl quantization . for other quantization models this relation holds only mod @xmath91 , ( _ egorov s theorem _ ) . when it is satisfied with equality , as it is in our case , it is called the _ exact _ egorov identity .",
    "an elegant way to define the metaplectic representation is to use the third version of the schrdinger representation discussed in the previous section , which identifies the metaplectic representation as a fourier transform ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath92 be a linear symplectomorphism of the plane , then let @xmath93 be a lagrangian subspace of @xmath63 and @xmath94 .",
    "define the quantization of @xmath92 as @xmath95 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the measure induced on the space of equivalence classes by the haar measure on @xmath98 . to write explicit formulas for @xmath99",
    "one needs to choose the algebraic complements @xmath100 and @xmath101 of @xmath93 and @xmath102 and unfold the isomorphism @xmath75 .",
    "for example , for @xmath103 if we set @xmath104 with variable @xmath31 and @xmath105 with variable @xmath30 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 , then @xmath108 the usual fourier transform , which establishes the unitary equivalence between the position and the momentum representations . similarly , for @xmath109 if we set @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , then @xmath113 which is the multiplication by the exponential of a quadratic function .",
    "these are the well known formulas that define the action of the metaplectic group on @xmath114 .",
    "the cocycle of the projective representation of the symplectic group is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the maslov index .",
