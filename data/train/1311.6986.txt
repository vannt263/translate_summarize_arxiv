    "recent observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , such as wmap and planck satellites @xcite show very good agreement of the observational data with the prediction of standard inflationary cosmology where primordial fluctuations generated from quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the most recent observations by the planck @xcite show that the primordial curvature perturbation has nearly scale invariant and follows almost perfect gaussian statistics .",
    "the non - gaussianity of primordial fluctuations is a powerful probe to discriminate inflationary models and also distinguish among different models ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , if any tiny signature from these observations will be detected , it can tell us important information on the physics behind inflation .",
    "the planck data @xcite have measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the so - called local type and equilateral type of non - gaussianity , respectively , at the 2@xmath3(95% ) confidence level .",
    "these observations show that the primordial curvature perturbation follows almost perfect gaussian statistics , however it may be detected at smaller scales and also as some tiny localized feature in the bispectrum .",
    "especially , although the quantity @xmath4 is now constrained very strongly , the possibility still remains that non - gaussianity of equilateral shape has localized features .",
    "if ever detected , it would tell us important properties of the curvature perturbation and be a probe to distinguish the models of inflation .",
    "the gradient expansion approach @xcite to discuss the evolution of nonlinear curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales is a powerful tool on calculation as well as the second - order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the lowest order in the expansion is the so - called @xmath0-formalism @xcite .",
    "but in order to analyzing local features of the equilateral bispectrum , this formula is not suitable since it leads to that nonlinearity of curvature perturbations on long - wavelength scales over horizon always generates the local shape of bispectrum",
    ". therefore we focus on the nonlinear theory valid to the next - leading order in the expansion .",
    "it called the beyond @xmath0-formalism and it is able to give us not only the local , but also the equilateral shape of bispectrum in contrast to @xmath0-formalism , even though the expansion technique is taken on superhorizon scales @xcite .",
    "our nonlinear theory of the next - leading order in the expansion includes such subhorizon effect corresponding to the equilateral shape by matching a superhorizon curvature perturbation and subhorizon one suitably .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the situation where effective sound speed changes with a finite duration time and analyze whether features can appear in the bispectrum , in particular of the equilateral shape by using our nonlinear perturbation theory .",
    "the previous papers have studied the models of varying sound speed both in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum @xcite ( see also _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for the heavy physics , related to the same purpose and references therein ) , where one basically assumed a sudden change , however , we particularly focus on the effect of a finite duration time . as a simple application of beyond @xmath0-formalism , we will consider a single scalar field whose effective sound speed will change in time due to a non - canonical kinetic term . as a first step , we will assume the background evolution follows a simple slow - roll inflation , although more realistic situation would be realized for a more complicated coupled kinetic term on multi - scalar system , such as the curvaton scenario @xcite , otherwise the slow - roll conditions will be also violated .",
    "however in this paper in order to extract the effects of the change of sound speed alone , we study the case of varying sound speed without affecting the background evolution as a simple tractable example , as same setup as in ref .",
    "@xcite and see the appendix therein for more detailed discussion .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review beyond @xmath0-formalism and especially , focus on the point that the master equations of curvature perturbation in linear and nonlinear theory show similar forms and derive the calculations .",
    "then we discuss the possible example as the case of varying sound speed in sec .",
    "iii and derive featured power spectrums and bispectra of the curvature perturbations affected by such changes .",
    "section iv is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the gradient expansion technique has been applied up to second order in the expansion to a universe dominated by a single @xcite and multi - scalar field @xcite , yielding the formalism `` beyond @xmath0 '' .",
    "the formulae have been also extended to be capable of a universe filled with a most generic non - canonical scalar field @xcite , which can give the so - called g - inflation . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a single scalar field as a simple example , whose kinetic term is a non - canonical , whose lagrangian takes the form ; @xmath5 where @xmath6 because we will later discuss the situation the effective sound speed : @xmath7 changes in time where the subscript @xmath8 represent derive with respect to @xmath8 and notice that the lagrangian denoted by @xmath9 plays the role of the pressure as shown in ref @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will briefly review beyond @xmath0-formalism for a single scalar field in this section .",
    "this system is characterized by a single scalar degree of freedom , and hence one expects that a single master variable governs the evolution of scalar perturbations even at nonlinear order . by virtue of gradient expansion",
    ", one can indeed derive a simple evolution equation can be reduced to a same form with a extended definition of @xmath10 . ] for an appropriately defined master variable @xmath11 on comoving hypersurfaces : @xmath12={{\\cal o}}(\\epsilon^4)\\,,\\label{ieq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath9 denote energy density and pressure of a scalar field , respectively , the prime represents differentiation with respect to the conformal time @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the small expansion parameter , and @xmath17 $ ] is the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath8 .",
    "hereafter we attach the superscript @xmath18 to a quantity of order of gradient expansion : @xmath19 and take the metric as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the lapse function , while the shift vector is vanishing at the next - leading order @xmath22 , then @xmath17 $ ] can be given by @xmath23=\\ ,   { -2 ( 2 \\delta \\ell^{(0)}+\\delta^{ij}\\partial_i \\ell^{(0 ) } \\partial_j \\ell^{(0)})e^{-2 \\ell^{(0)}}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{def : r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equation ( [ ieq1 ] ) is to be compared with its linear counterpart : @xmath24 from which one notices the correspondence between the linear and nonlinear evolution equations . in order to calculate the evolution equations in fourier space , we have to take the replacement @xmath25 .",
    "it is important notice that the structures of both ( [ ieq1 ] ) and ( [ ieq2 ] ) are similar forms , except for last terms in the left hand sides .",
    "this point is advantage in order to estimate evolutions of curvature perturbations in linear and nonlinear theory since same calculation is valid on following the evolution equation .",
    "we will see the details later .      to obtain the power spectrum",
    ", we will use the linear theory of the curvature perturbation in this subsection . the above equation ( [ ieq2 ] )",
    "has two independent solutions ; conventionally called a growing mode and a decaying mode .",
    "we assume that the growing mode is constant in time at leading order in the spatial gradient expansion .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the linear solution valid up to @xmath26 can be obtained as @xmath27u^{(0)}_{\\bm{k}}\\ , , \\label{sol : linear rc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integrals @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been given as @xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote an initial time of gradient expansion and the conformal hubble parameter @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the integrals in ( [ int - tildf ] ) represent a decaying and growing mode solution , respectively .    note that @xmath35 that is just a constant solution , while @xmath36 .",
    "thus if the factor @xmath37 is large , it represents an enhancement of the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales due the @xmath26 effect .",
    "here it is useful to consider an explicit expression for @xmath38 in terms of @xmath39 and its derivative at @xmath40 .",
    "the result is @xmath41    in order to relate our calculation with the standard formula for the curvature perturbation in linear theory , we introduce @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) which denotes the time at which the comoving wavenumber has crossed the hubble horizon , @xmath44 the power spectrum at the horizon crossing time is given by @xmath45 by inverting @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 as shown in @xcite , we can show the final value of the linear curvature perturbation as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 the formula ( [ eqn : alphau ] ) will be used in the next subsection .",
    "the power spectrum at the final time is thus enhanced by the factor @xmath51 as @xmath52      using the linear solution of the curvature perturbation given by ( [ sol : linear rc ] ) , here we can derive the nonlinear solution by matching the two at @xmath40 .",
    "the main purpose of the matching is to make it possible to analyze superhorizon nonlinear evolution valid up to the second order in gradient expansion , starting from a solution in the linear theory . in particular",
    ", we would like to evaluate the bispectrum induced by the superhorizon nonlinear evolution .",
    "for this purpose , we need to have full control over terms up not only to @xmath26 but also to @xmath53 , where we suppose that the linear solution is of order @xmath54 . therefore , the matching condition at @xmath40 should be of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions of @xmath32 and spatial coordinates .",
    "while the linear solution @xmath58 is considered as an input , i.e. , initial condition , the additional terms , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are to be determined by the following condition .",
    "the terms of order @xmath53 in @xmath61 and @xmath62 should vanish at the horizon crossing when @xmath63 .",

    "here we can notice that in order to the final values of curvature perturbation both in linear ( [ eqn : alphau ] ) and in nonlinear theory ( [ sol : infty rreal ] ) , all one have to do is to estimate the same integrals shown in both theories as @xmath75 and @xmath74 in @xmath76 .",
    "the reason why is that the master equations ( [ ieq1 ] ) and ( [ ieq2 ] ) for both theories have the same structures of evolution equation as described before .    in this subsection",
    ", we calculate the bispectrum of our nonlinear curvature perturbation by assuming that @xmath77 is a gaussian random variable .",

    "the final result ( [ sol : infty rreal ] ) can be reduced to @xmath78 by assuming the gaussian statistics for @xmath77 , it is easy to calculate the power spectrum shown as ( [ eqn : powerspectrum ] ) with ( [ eq : power spectrum for r ] ) and the bispectrum of primordial curvature perturbation : @xmath79 .    the dimensionless bispectrum @xmath80 is expressed in terms of the fourier transformation of the three point function as @xmath81 where @xmath82 means that it extracts out only connected graphs .",
    "we use the dimensionless quantity @xmath83 to represent the amplitude of the bispectrum with the uncorrected power spectrum @xmath84 , which has been defined by @xmath85 .",

    "the power spectrum of @xmath77 is written as ( [ eq : power spectrum for r ] ) .",

    "we can introduce a new parameter @xmath100 , which represents the ratio of sound speed before and after the transition .",
    "if we take the width of duration very small @xmath101 , the model results in the previous study of sudden varying sound speeds as in @xcite . throughout this paper , we set @xmath102 , but the results do not depend on specifying the choice of the parameter .",

    "we can see the featured bispectrum in fig.[feq ] where we take small values of @xmath122 as @xmath124 and @xmath125 , pointing @xmath126 within the recent constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "the cases for other values of @xmath122 show no such feature in fig.[feq - t ] , where the equilateral bispectrum increases(decreases ) towards super(sub)horizon scale as seen in the left(right ) panel .",
    "we can also see small feature at subhorizon scale @xmath127 for large value of @xmath128 , however this value of amplitude of the feature is too small to be detectable .",

    "takes an advantage to calculating the correlated features for power spectrum and bispectrum since the calculation is basically as same as solving the power spectrum .    as one application of our formalism for a single scalar field",
    ", we investigate the case of varying sound speed .",
    "the previous studies @xcite have done for a sudden changing , but in this paper we studied a changing with a finite duration time need to solve numerically ( see @xcite , which also studied such mild transit in the speed of sound and also @xcite for recent analysis by using planck data ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze whether the features can appear in the bispectrum , in particular of equilateral shape by using our nonlinear perturbation theory .",
    "the case is more suitable to calculate by using our formalism than by using the in - in formalism .",
    "we discuss local features of primordial power and bispectrum generated by the effect of varying sound speed .",
    "as shown in @xcite by using a similar way , we have also investigated one application of the beyond @xmath0 for analyzing the featured bispectrum affected by a sharp change in the inflaton s potential slope .    as shown in fig.[feq ] , we can see a local feature like a bump at @xmath129 for a small value of @xmath130 in the equilateral bispectrum , which has a peak value of non - gaussianity ; @xmath131 at most , consistent within the recent observational constraint by planck .",
    "however , such parameters also lead to the features in the power spectrum , which are excluded from the observations since the current cmb experiment gives a strong constraint , which is sensitive to @xmath132 by cmb temperature power spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this study is one toy model as a first step to investigate more realistic situation , that is for example , including a background evolution , extending to multi - field system , etc .",
