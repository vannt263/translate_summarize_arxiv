    "one of the most exciting astrophysical applications of gravitational lensing is the determination of the cosmological distance scale .",
    "the technique of measuring the hubble constant in multiply imaged variable sources was developed by refsdal ( 1964 ) , who realized that the time delay between variations of the individual images is inversely proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "so far , two accurate time delays have been reported in the literature , one in the double quasar q  0957 + 561 ( kundi et  al .",
    "1996 ) and the other in the quadruple quasar pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter et  al .",
    "1997 ) , yielding consistent values of the hubble constant .",
    "however , before refsdal s method is universally accepted as a competitor to the traditional distance ladder approach , it has to be applied to a statistically significant sample of systems with different image morphologies and source and lens redshifts to verify the validity of the lensing models ( blandford & kundi 1997 ) .",
    "one of the systems that shows good promise for extending the time delay work is the quadruple quasar b  1422 + 231 .",

    "similar groups have been found by hickson ( 1982 ) and studied in detail by hickson et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) . while the lensing group in the b  1422 + 231 system has a higher velocity dispersion than is typical of hickson s compact groups ( hcgs ) , it is still within the range of hickson s sample .",
    "as we mentioned above , most of the velocity dispersion is contributed by the brightest group galaxy g3 , whose rest - frame velocity is @xmath31 km s@xmath3 higher than the median velocity of the group .",
    "this galaxy would be excluded by hickson et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) from the sample of accordant members , which must have velocities within 1000 km s@xmath3 of the group median .",

    "however , because of its magnitude and central location within the group we retain g3 in the subsequent analysis .    there are at least three other qso gravitational lens systems where the primary lens is surrounded by a group or a cluster : the double quasar q  0957 + 561 ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) , the quadruple quasar pg  1115 + 080 ( weymann et  al.1980 ) , and the recently discovered radio quad mg  0751 + 2716 ( lehr et  al .",
    "1997 ) . in the largest - separation confirmed lens system , q  0957 + 561 , the primary lens is positioned near the center of a medium - rich cluster with the velocity dispersion of @xmath33 km s@xmath3 ( angonin - willaime , soucail , & vanderriest 1994 ) .",
    "both pg  1115 + 080 ( kundi et  al .",
    "1997 ) and mg  0751 + 2716 are lensed by compact groups of galaxies , although the redshifts of the mg  0751 + 2716 group galaxies are not yet available .    in table",
    "[ groups.tab ] we compare properties of the two lensing groups that have been spectroscopically investigated at keck : pg  1115 + 080 and b  1422 + 231 .",
    "both systems are similarly compact , but the velocity dispersion is much higher in b  1422 + 231 as a result of the large velocity difference between g3 and the rest of the group . assuming that these lensing groups are self - gravitating , their masses can be estimated using the virial theorem ( e.g. heisler , tremaine , & bahcall 1985 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the line - of - sight velocity of the @xmath36th galaxy relative to the centroid of the group , and @xmath37 is the projected separation of galaxies @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "the virial estimates , as well as the light - weighted group centroids , are listed in table  [ groups.tab ] .",
    "these values should be treated with caution , because of the small number of galaxies used to derive them .",
    "the assumptions inherent in the virial mass estimate ( eq .  [ virial.eq ] ) and its accuracy in reproducing the masses of simulated groups are discussed by heisler et  al .",
    "these authors find that 75% of mass estimates lie within 10@xmath39 of the correct value for groups with 5 members .",
    "frequent occurrence of groups and clusters near the primary lens is an important clue for statistical studies of gravitational lensing .",
    "keeton , kochanek , & seljak ( 1996 , hereafter kks96 ) have convincingly shown that external shear is a more fundamental parameter for the lensing models than the radial distribution of mass in the primary lens .",
    "external sources of shear thus warrant careful observational scrutiny .",
    "shortly after discovery of b  1422 + 231 , lens models of this system were constructed by hogg & blandford ( 1994 , hereafter hb94 ) and by kormann , schneider , & bartelmann ( 1994 ) .",
    "it was realized by both groups that a substantial ellipticity in the potential is required to successfully reproduce the observed morphology of the system .",
    "however , the two sets of models disagree on the relative importance of external shear and internal ellipticity in breaking the circular symmetry of the lens potential .",
    "hb94 rely on strong external shear from two nearby bright galaxies , g2 and g3 , while kormann et  al .",
    "make g1 highly elliptical .",
    "subsequent _ hst _ observations of the lens ( impey et  al .",
    "1996 ) showed that its optical axis ratio @xmath40 is smaller than the ratio predicted by the kormann et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) models , @xmath41 .",
    "the observations can only be reconciled with the models if the dark matter distribution in the lens is significantly flatter than its optical isophotes .",
    "more recently , kks96 modeled b  1422 + 231 as part of their investigation of shear and ellipticity in gravitational lenses . a new observational input for these models was a precise position of the primary lens g1 provided by the _ hst _ imaging ( impey et  al.1996 ) . kks96",
    "distinguish between two classes of models : single - shear and multiple - shear .",
    "single - shear models feature only one source of ellipticity which is provided either by the primary lens or by an external shear field . in the two - shear models , there are two independent sources of ellipticity with major axes that are generally misaligned",
    ". based on previous work ( kochanek 1991 , wambsganss & paczyski 1994 ) and their own models , kks96 argue that adding additional parameters to the radial distribution of a model generally does little to improve the fit . on the other hand , kks96",
    "show that including additional sources of shear often results in dramatic improvements .",
    "unfortunately , this is not true for b  1422 + 231 .",
    "the @xmath42 of the one - shear model , in which the primary lens is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere perturbed by a quadrupole shear potential , is 40.3 for 6 degrees of freedom and 9 parameters .",
    "the corresponding two - shear model , consisting of a singular isothermal ellipsoid in an external shear field , has a @xmath42 of 33.7 and 4 degrees of freedom ( kks96 ) .",
    "the justification of adding new parameters to the model can be assessed with a standard f - test ( e.g. lupton 1993 ) .",
    "according to this test , the probability of @xmath42 decreasing from 40.3 to 33.7 when two _ arbitrary _ parameters are added to the model is 76% , suggesting that the second shear does not significantly reduce the @xmath42 .",
    "normally , the extra parameters would be accepted only if the f - test probability were smaller than 5% .",
    "another reason to doubt the importance of the second shear term is the alignment of the two axes in the two - shear model : the angle between them is only 4@xmath43 ( kks96 ) .",
    "we are left with the conclusion that the best current model of the system consists of a singular isothermal sphere in the external shear field of the group , which is essentially the original hb94 model .",
    "there are , however , two potential problems with the hb94 model : it requires large external shear from a massive perturber , and it fails to reproduce the flux ratio of images a and b at radio wavelengths .",
    "we consider these two problems in turn .    in the previous section",
    ", we estimated the lensing group mass using the virial theorem .",
    "we can divide this value with the combined @xmath19 luminosity of group members , and compare the resulting near - infrared mass - to - light ratio of the lensing group with optical ratios of local groups .",
    "the total near - infrared luminosity of the lensing group galaxies , corrected by @xmath44 mag to account for the light outside of the @xmath45 aperture , is @xmath46 . at the redshift of @xmath47 ,",
    "this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath50 .",
    "we applied a @xmath51-correction of @xmath52 mag ( poggianti 1997 ) and neglected the evolutionary corrections and the difference between the @xmath19 and @xmath51 bands . using the absolute magnitude of the sun , @xmath53 ( allen 1973 )",
    ", we find that the near - infrared mass - to - light ratio of the group is 40@xmath54 in solar units . in a large sample of nearby groups",
    "ramella et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that their blue mass - to - light ratios range between 160@xmath54 and 330@xmath54 .",
    "taking into account that the mass - to - light ratio of an old stellar population is 6 - 8 times higher in blue than it is in @xmath51 ( worthey 1994 ) , we conclude that the b  1422 + 231 lensing group fits well within the ramella et  al .  sample .    for the purpose of lens modeling , we can directly use the measured velocity dispersion of the group , but we have to make certain assumptions about the mass profile .",
    "if we model the group as a singular isothermal sphere , its velocity dispersion of 550 km s@xmath3 acting at an angular distance of @xmath55  arcsec will produce the dimensionless shear of @xmath56 at the position of the lens .",
    "this shear is consistent with the value expected in the hb94 model and the related one - shear kks96 model .",
    "it is also worth noting that group galaxies g2g6 are so close to the line of sight to the qso that they undoubtedly contribute to the convergence ( dimensionless surface mass density ) as well as the shear .",
    "if the lensing group has singular isothermal sphere profile , the convergence @xmath57 is equal to the shear @xmath58",
    ". a uniform convergence term in the model does not affect the observed image positions and relative fluxes ; however , it will affect the inferred distance to the lens when the time delays are measured ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ) .",
    "we have accounted for the presence of a massive perturber , but the fact that the hb94 model fails to reproduce the radio flux ratio of images a and b remains a serious problem . in the refined model of hb94",
    "the relative magnification of these two images is 0.77 , many standard deviations away from the radio measurement of @xmath59 ( patnaik et  al .",
    "however , optical and near - infrared measurements have consistently produced lower flux ratios clustering around 0.8 ( lawrence et  al .  1992 , remy et  al .",
    "1993 , yee & ellingson 1994 , hammer et  al .  1995 , akujor et  al.1996 , impey et  al .",
    "1996 , yee & bechtold 1996 ) .",
    "it is difficult to explain the difference between the radio and the optical as a result of absorption along the line of sight to the quasar because the flux ratio is nearly identical in all bands between @xmath60 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is also unlikely that it can be explained by microlensing since the ratio has not changed over at least a year ( yee & bechtold 1996 ) and even longer if data taken by different observers are included .",
    "regardless of which ratio represents the true relative magnification of the two images , it is important that we explain the observed discrepancy , as it may have profound consequences for models of other gravitational lens systems .",
    "based on keck spectroscopy of the gravitational lens system b  1422 + 231 , we conclude that the primary lens and four nearby objects belong to a compact group of galaxies at @xmath61 .",
    "the virial mass of this group , inferred from its median projected radius of 35 @xmath1 kpc and its velocity dispersion of @xmath2 550 km s@xmath3 , amounts to @xmath62 .",
    "this concentration of mass , located some @xmath63 from the quasar images , is sufficient to produce the observed image configuration in a simple lens model consisting of a singular isothermal sphere in a strong external shear field .",
    "the same model successfully accounts for the optical and near - infrared flux ratios of the images , although it remains inconsistent with the relative magnification of images a and b in radio .",
    "an accurate lens model for this system is of great importance because photometric monitoring shows the source to be intrinsically variable on the timescales comparable to the predicted time delay between the triplet abc and image d ( hjorth et  al.1996 , yee & bechtold 1996 , turner et  al .",
    "1997 ) . using the lens redshift of @xmath64 ,",
    "the hb94 model predicts this time delay to be about 15 @xmath1 days .",
    "the delays between images a , b and c are all smaller than a day  too short to measure at optical and radio wavelengths .    by trimming down model space and reducing the uncertainty in predicted time delays ,",
    "the observations presented here improve the chances of using this system to measure the hubble constant .",
    "together with the spectroscopic observations of pg  1115 + 080 ( kundi et  al.1997 ) , they also suggest that a number of gravitational lens systems are influenced by significant external shear .",
    "the external shear provided by galaxies associated with the primary lens naturally explains why many lens models require potentials that are more elliptical than the images of the primary lensing galaxy would suggest .",
    "external shear could also be responsible for the large number of quadruple lenses relative to the doubles ( king et  al .",
    ". a spectroscopic survey of the fields around other gravitational lenses would thus provide valuable observational input for estimates of external shear in these systems .",
