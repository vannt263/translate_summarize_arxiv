    "high precision or high energy are necessary to study the matter at short distances .",
    "the most powerful accelerators are the cosmic ones in the outer space . we know that the earth is hit by cosmic rays of very high energy , which means that there have to be astrophysical mechanisms capable of accelerating protons to those high energies .",
    "it is then also possible that the same mechanisms could produce neutrinos of high energy or that the protons and radiation produced interact with matter to originate extremely high energy neutrinos .",
    "some candidate neutrino sources are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , which are the central regions of certain galaxies where the radiation emitted is comparable to the total radiation from the entire galaxy , and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite , that are the most powerful explosions since the big bang resulting usually from the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "the integrated effect over all astrophysical sources in the sky where such producing mechanisms may operate , is expected to lead to a diffuse neutrino flux that could be detected by icecube @xcite .",
    "this next - generation neutrino telescope is planned to have a good directional resolution , a fact that will be useful for our purposes .",
    "another source of neutrinos that contributes to a diffuse flux is given by the collisions of cosmic rays with the nucleons of the atmosphere , however for energies above @xmath0 gev , the extraterrestrial diffuse flux should start to dominate over the atmospheric spectrum .",
    "these high energy neutrinos coming from different sources can be used to look for new physics effects in neutrino - nucleon interactions using the nucleons of the earth as targets . in order to bound such effects ,",
    "the different observables that have been studied , basically arise from comparing the upward - going flux that survives after passing through the earth ( which is strongly dependent on the neutrino - nucleon cross section ) to the standard model prediction @xcite .",
    "in this work we define the observable @xmath1 in the following way . considering only upward - going neutrinos , that is , the ones with arrival directions @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath4 the angle such that the number of events for @xmath5 equals the number of events for @xmath6 . clearly , the value of @xmath4 is energy dependent . at low energies",
    "the cross section is lower and the earth is essentially transparent to neutrinos . in this case , @xmath7 since for a diffuse isotropic flux this angle divides the hemisphere into two sectors with the same solid angle . obviously , for extremely high energies where most neutrinos are absorbed , @xmath8 , and for intermediate energies @xmath4 varies accordingly between these two limiting behaviors .",
    "we will consider only the diffuse neutrino flux from extraterrestrial origin and assume that it is isotropic .",
    "the use of the observable @xmath1 reduces the effects of the experimental systematics and initial flux dependence .",
    "the functional form of @xmath1 sharply depends on the interaction cross section neutrino - nucleon . in this conditions , if physics beyond the standard model operates at these high energies , it will become manifest directly on the function @xmath1 .",
    "if we take into account a diffuse neutrino flux and for simplicity we consider it as decreasing with energy ( an example is the given by the waxman and bacall @xcite ) , then in a first analysis we can safely neglect the regeneration effects and approximate the surviving neutrino flux by @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of nucleons per unit area in the neutrino path through the earth , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the initial neutrino flux , @xmath13 is the avogradro number , @xmath14 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath2 is the nadir angle taken from the downward - going normal to the neutrino telescope .",
    "upward - going neutrinos can originate , though cc @xmath15 interactions , energetic muons that will traverse the detector .",
    "this is the traditional observation mode , in which the background due to atmospheric muons is eliminated .",
    "simulations based on amanda data indicate that the direction of muons can be determined to sub - degree accuracy and their energy can be measured to better than @xmath16 in the logarithm of the energy .",
    "the important advantage of this mode is the angular sub - degree resolution . on the other hand , as it was recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , in icecube we will have sufficient energy resolution to separately assign the energy fractions in the muon track and the hadronic shower allowing the determination of the inelasticity distribution and the neutrino energy .",
    "recently , the possibility to measure the inelasticity distribution was used to study the possibility to place bounds to new effects coming from leptoquarks or black - hole production over kinematic regions never tested before @xcite . in our particular case , the possibility of independently measuring the muon energy and the hadronic shower energy will allow us to have a reasonable @xmath17-energy determination .",
    "hence , in the following we shall take the @xmath17-energy bin partition interval as @xmath18 .    to a good approximation ,",
    "the expected number of events at icecube in the energy interval @xmath19 and in the angular interval @xmath20 is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the number of target nucleons in the effective volume , @xmath23 is the running time , and @xmath24 is the neutrino - nucleon cross section . in our analysis",
    "we are interested only in cc contained events , for which an accurate measurement of the inelasticity can be obtained .",
    "we take as the detection volume for contained events the instrumented volume for icecube which is roughly 1 km@xmath25 and corresponds to @xmath26 .    since the definition of @xmath4 is the equality between two number of events , then to a good approximation for each energy bin",
    "all the previous factors cancel except the integrated fluxes at each side .",
    "thus , @xmath4 can be defined by the equation    @xmath27    which is numerically solved to give the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfsm ] .",
    "there we have considered the standard model cross section as it was calculated in @xcite , and for @xmath10 we use eq .",
    "[ tau ] with the earth density as given by the prem @xcite .",
    "both the sm predictions for the total cross section and the earth density have uncertainties that propagate into the observable @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfa ] , where the new physics effects on @xmath1 are shown , the effects of the mentioned uncertainties of the observable are also included .    to reduce background , one looks for upward - moving muons produced when neutrinos coming from the opposite side of the earth interact with the nucleons in their path .",
    "directional reconstruction of these tracks suppresses the atmospheric muons background . by selecting the neutrino events that are upward - going it is possible to eliminate the atmospheric muons since they are downward - going",
    "in order to model in a general way the new physics effects on @xmath1 , we consider general 4-fermion interactions as given by an effective operator that includes also the sm fields involved in the neutrino - nucleon scattering with left - handed neutrinos .",
    "if there are new interactions between quarks and leptons , then the new effects should appear at an energy enough high .",
    "we call this characteristic energy scale for the new interactions @xmath28 . at energies below @xmath28 ,",
    "these interactions are suppressed by an inverse power of @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig : diag ] for charged and neutral currents .",

    "the usual benchmark here is the so - called waxman - bahcall ( wb ) flux for each flavor ,    @xmath61    which is derived assuming that neutrinos come from transparent cosmic ray sources @xcite , and that there is adequate transfer of energy to pions following @xmath62 collisions .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that if there are in fact hidden sources which are opaque to ultra - high energy cosmic rays , then the expected neutrino flux will be higher .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the experimental bound set by amanda . a summary of the bounds can be found in refs . @xcite and",
    "a representative value for it is    @xmath63    however , with the intention to estimate the number of events we have considered an intermediate flux level slightly below the present amanda experimental bound ,    @xmath64    which is the flux that we have used to estimate the uncertainties on the angle @xmath4 .    in fig .",

    "we also include the uncertainties in the standard model prediction coming from the ones in the event numbers ( shaded region ) .    in the same context , we can define another observable related to @xmath66 .",
    "we consider the hemisphere @xmath3 divided into two regions by the angle @xmath52 , @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
