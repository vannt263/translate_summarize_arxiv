    "the hypothesis of cosmological inflation in the early universe is useful in answering several fundamental questions of cosmology such as why the energy - matter distribution in the universe is homogeneous ; problem of fine - tuning of the initial velocities of the energy - matter ( the flatness problem ) , the magnetic monopole problem and the horizon problem .",
    "moreover the inflaton that drives the inflation serves as the harbinger of seed fluctuations for later large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure ( lss ) are used to determine the spectrum of primordial seed fluctuations .",
    "this makes cmb and lss experiments the only probes of the very early universe .",
    "current observations are in excellent agreement with the basic inflationary predictions : the universe has an almost scale - invariant gaussian power spectrum @xcite . to have a better view on the essence of the late time cosmic acceleration , one geometrical approach is to use the @xmath1 gravity .",
    "this theory was proposed by buchdahl as a mathematical extension of the einstein gravity in a very simple and systematic form @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include a non - zero cosmological constant or dynamical dark energy models @xcite .",
    "different aspects of dark energy models have been discussed recently ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "curvature is not a unique description of the gravity .",
    "going beyond the riemannian geometry , one can use torsion as an alternative for geometrical description of the gravity @xcite .",
    "general relativity is constructed using a symmetric levi civita connection whereas teleparallel gravity is constructed from a skew - symmetric weitzenbock connection . in recent years",
    "attentions have been focused on the generalizations of this idea as teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "different cosmological aspects of @xmath0 gravity such as resolution of dark energy and dark matter problems with torsion have been discussed in literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) . also some black holes solutions are also derived in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "conventional inflation model has two distinct stages of evolution .",
    "the first stage is governed by the rapid accelerated expansion driven by the inflaton with negligible kinetic energy and a stable potential energy . in the second stage ( called reheating )",
    ", the inflaton decays into matter and radiation fields which is a kind of a hot big bang .",
    "the main problem is how we can join the universe towards the end of this era , successfully .",
    "although both stages are driven by different physical mechanisms , the idea of warm inflation amazingly unifies them @xcite . here",
    "inflation is described as a decay of the field into thermal component via weak and strong dissipation regimes . in this scenario",
    ", it is assumed that the radiation ( produced during the inflation ) keeps a constant density .",
    "this constant energy density preserves the form of the cosmological solution as a transition phase in the form of the de - sitter universe . to validate this proposal ,",
    "we need a dissipative formalism .",
    "the dissipation coefficient @xmath2 is necessary to explain this heating phase completely .",
    "the full consistent model to construct this dissipation functions is fulfilled by quantum field theory tools using a two stage mechanism , applied on the interactions @xcite .",
    "we need warm inflationary epoch to stop the inflation in a finite time .",
    "dynamics of the warm inflation has some interesting features .",
    "the main aspect is , during the radiation production , some microscopic ( micro - statistical ) procedures happen .",
    "the average time of this cascade process goes faster than the velocity ( here hubble parameter ) of the background .",
    "if we denote by @xmath3 a typical decay rate of one of these process , than it means that @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the quantum photon productions slows - down the dynamics of the cosmological background .",

    "this idea has motivations from the tachyonic field as well @xcite , the hawking radiation @xcite and via holographic principle @xcite .",
    "the scale factor of the cosmological background through the inflationary era must be a power law or exponential of an intermediate form .",
    "such forms of the scale factor possess exact solutions for fields ( vector , scalar , .. ) .",

    "the intermediate inflationary scenario has been proposed as solution for a constrained inflaton potential function in the form @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "it turns out that cosmic inflation was de sitter - like with @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) @xcite . to model a cosmic accelerated expansion in very early universe , it is convenient to use scalar fields and we employ the same strategy .",
    "such cosmic inflaton is quasi - stable and can decay to other forms of energy like radiation and matter in the process of reheating as discussed in conventional inflationary models .",
    "moreover the quantum fluctuations in a quantum inflaton will serve as seeds for later structure formation .",
    "the dynamical equations are described by : @xmath52 here @xmath53 may be taken general as a function of the inflaton @xmath24 , or the average temperature @xmath54 , or both @xcite .",
    "furthermore we suppose that @xmath55 , as the second law of thermodynamics must be valid even in the inflationary era . in inflationary epoch , the friedmann equation ( [ frw1 ] ) reduces to @xmath56 the perturbations of the scalar field at the quantum level were the initial seeds in the universe and which culminated in the large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "it is believed that quantum field theoretic version of warm inflation resolves the horizon and flatness problem @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath57 as the decay ( or dissipation ) rate defined by @xmath58 here the decay rate @xmath57 is a dynamical quantity . to estimate @xmath57",
    "we need the form of @xmath2 . in accordance to the results of the qft the interacting supersymmetric theory @xcite , the decay rate can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 in which @xmath61 . here",

    "it is one possible form of the dissipation parameter .",
    "other forms are different and they need separate calculations ( beyond the scope of our work ) .",
    "we study two models : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is bath s temperature . just as a historical fact",
    "we mention here that in the original proposal of warm inflation , the authors at that time , could not specify the precise form of @xmath2 due to the lack of a detailed model @xcite . later on taking motivation from super - string theory and quantum field theoretic approach ,",
    "a suitable forms of @xmath2 were derived @xcite .    from eqs .",
    "( [ red1 ] ) and ( [ red ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 here the choice of @xmath0 must be astrophysically viable which means that it must be in conformity with the observational data .",
    "we assume that in inflationary epoch , radiation is prone to decay on average on certain cosmic time scales i.e. @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . from ( [ red2 ] )",
    "we get the modified radiation density as @xmath68 in other words , if the decay is much rapid than cosmic expansion @xmath69 , ( keeping @xmath70 to avoid ghosts ) the radiation density will keep on increasing . in warm inflationary scenario , the period of inflation continuously ( but very rapidly ) dilutes to the radiation density .",
    "but due to presence of dissipation , the depletion of radiation is compensated . inserting ( [ dotphi ] ) in ( [ rhor ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath71 which can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 . here",
    "@xmath74 denotes the countable numbers of relativistic degeneracy of states and @xmath64 is the average temperature for the background of thermal bath given by @xmath75    now from ( [ frw1 ] ) and ( [ rhor2 ] ) we obtain the inflaton scalar potential @xmath76 we consider the following model of modified gravity @xcite @xmath77 the first linear term indicates the lagrangian for @xmath0 gravity and is dynamically equivalent to the general relativity at the level of action .",
    "the second term denotes a ghost dark energy and performs a role of cosmological constant and the last term @xmath78 is a constant .",
    "we mention here that @xmath0 represents the geometrical part of our model .",
    "there is no dark energy in our model . strictly speaking , in the warm inflation scenario and in inflationary era when the inflation is driven by inflaton field",
    ", we can safely neglect the dark energy density .",
    "so , the only thing which we need is a background with a definite geometry , here is the spacetime with torsion and radiation and inflaton .",
    "so , this @xmath0 can be considered just as geometry .",
    "it is not necessary for @xmath0 model to mimic the equation of state of any kind of dark energy .",
    "but it can be reconstructed mathematically as a toy model of a type of dark energy ghost dark energy if and only if we neglect all matter fields . in our context",
    ", we used this form of @xmath0 because it is a viable model .",
    "however we redefine the field equation in terms of effective frw field equations as the following : @xmath79 we observe that in the absence of any matter field ( beyond our inflationary scenario with matter fields like radiation , inflaton ) ( [ ft ] ) gives us @xmath80 .",
    "it has the meaning of a mathematical reconstruction of a type of dark energy which is not interesting for us in this paper .",
    "if we investigate dark energy this form of energy density makes us worry . but here in inflationary era , we do not need any dark energy component .",
    "further more @xmath81 does not indicate any dark energy .",
    "so absence of such variable @xmath81 does not sense any problem for our model .",
    "we used @xmath0 just for gravity of the model . for dynamical evolution",
    "we have inflaton and radiation .",
    "note that in inflationary models , radiation and inflaton are the most important fields .",
    "the action ansatz ( [ ft ] ) is different form a pure cosmological constant .",
    "it can be reconstructed from different points of view @xcite .",
    "so this form of @xmath0 is one of the most physically viable models of @xmath0 proposed by us as the first time @xcite .",
    "it reduces to the tegr with a cosmological constant .",
    "even if we treat with @xmath0 as a model of dark energy this simple model is able to explain warm inflation in a generalized teleparallel gravity .    in order to recover the intermediate scenario",

    "the scale factor and hubble parameter is suitably chosen so that it is consistent with the @xmath0 gravity and the intermediate expansion .",
    "the scale factor is necessary to perform the analysis and therefore working with a hypothetical scale factor may not be consistent with the inflationary scenario .",
    "hence we picked the intermediate scale factor which is also consistent with astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "the slow - roll parameters which provide a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for inflation are defined as @xcite @xmath92 in the present context , using ( [ ansatz ] ) , the slow - roll parameters yield @xmath93 the first very interesting observation from ( [ epi ] ) is that the ratio between two slow - roll parameters remains constant , free from the model of @xmath0 or time evolution of the hubble parameter i.e. @xmath94 also since always @xmath95 , so to have a small set of the parameters we must have @xmath96 . since @xmath97 , our model implies two possible situations : either @xmath98 ( it corresponds to the @xmath99 ) and finite @xmath100 or @xmath101 and @xmath102 is finite .",

    "we need also a perturbation theory for our model .",
    "in the flat frw background , this perturbation can be computed just using the perturbation of the inflaton @xmath24 . in the warm inflation",
    "the expression of the fluctuations of the inflaton reads @xmath113 now for power spectrum of the primordial cosmic radiation , a more general expression reads as the following @xcite @xmath114 here , the starred quantities correspond to the evaluated parameters at horizon crossing @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite , that in the regime when particle production is not so high",
    ", it is possible to ignore @xmath115 from the power spectrum calculations .",
    "this power spectrum is a function of the wavelength .",

    "the early cobe experiment results turned out to be in agreement with the above prediction @xcite .",

    "our model predicts a non - gaussianity of cmb which varies for differently picked e - folding numbers . here",
    "i.e. wave number interval is related with number of e - fold parameter .",
    "following @xcite , if the tensor perturbations are generated during inflation , than it would produce gravitational wave .",

    "<S> we calculate the relevant inflationary observables such as scalar - tensor ratio , power - spectrum indices of density perturbations and gravitational waves and the e - folding parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a ratio of slow - roll parameters to be constant . </S>",
