    "the driven pendulum is a generic model used for studying nonlinear dynamics in mechanics @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "its geometric nonlinearity can be modeled reliably ( in contrast to other nonlinear effects such as friction ) , and mechanical pendula are amenable to experimental investigations .",
    "the dynamical properties of the classical parametrically driven pendulum , such as resonances , escape from a potential well , symmetry - breaking , and periodic and chaotic attractors , have been explored in detail experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "this paper studies what happens to the well - studied bifurcation scenarios of the parametrically excited pendulum if the driving of the pivot of the pendulum follows a narrow upright ellipse ; see figure  [ fig : parapendulum ] .",
    "one motivation for studying elliptic excitation is that only the elliptic component of an arbitrarily shaped periodic excitation has an effect on a rotating pendulum for large excitation frequencies ; see section  [ sec : reduce ] for an explanation .",
    "moreover , elliptic excitation is typical if the pendulum base is floating on water waves : a small freely floating body moves along an ellipse .",
    "this effect is similar to the elliptic motion of an off - center surface point of a plate excited by a circular traveling bending wave ( a principle that is exploited in rotary ultrasonic motors @xcite ) .",
    "we say that the pendulum _ rotates _ if the long - time average of the angular velocity is non - zero .",
    "stable periodic rotations occur naturally over a large range of excitation parameters in the parametrically driven pendulum @xcite .",
    "thus , a rotating pendulum provides a unique mechanism for generating a uniformly one - directional rotation from a bounded excitation .",
    "this is a potential physical principle for harnessing the energy of vibrations , which are not necessarily purely in the vertical direction .",
    "the other motivation for focusing on rotating attractors is that the rotating pendulum is ideal for developing and testing non - invasive bifurcation and chaos control methods @xcite in a real experiment : periodic rotations are reliably controllable by superimposing feedback control onto the excitation without changing the shape of the excitation .",
    "this is not true in general for small - amplitude oscillations around the hanging - down position @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless equation of motion for the elliptically excited pendulum is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dimensionless viscous damping coefficient , @xmath2 is the scaled excitation amplitude , @xmath3 the rescaled excitation frequency , and @xmath4 is the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical diameter of the upright ellipse traced out by the pivot during each period ( see figure  [ fig : parapendulum ] ) .",
    "the classical parametrically excited pendulum corresponds to the setting @xmath5 .",
    "the two main effects of a small non - zero ellipticity @xmath4 of the excitation are :    1 .",
    "[ tongues ] the classical resonance tongues for the 1:2 and the 1:1 resonance of the parametrically excited pendulum @xcite merge into a single region of instability of the small - amplitude period - one libration around the hanging - down position of the pendulum .",
    "[ pref ] if the ellipticity @xmath4 is non - zero the pendulum is no longer symmetric with respect to reflection @xmath6 , which causes a preference for rotations that have the same direction as the motion of the pivot .",
    "effectively , the range of possible excitation frequencies and amplitudes where rotations are supported increases for increasing ellipticity . the preferred direction of rotation has the same sense ( clockwise or anti - clockwise ) as the motion of the base around the ellipse ( for example , clockwise rotation is preferred if the pivot moves clockwise around the ellipse ) because this rotation picks up energy from the additional excitation in the horizontal direction",
    ".    these two observations are , in short , the key findings of the paper .",
    "point  [ pref ] is , for large frequencies , universal for all shapes of excitation that have a dominant vertical component .",
    "this will be shown in section  [ sec : reduce ] by averaging the equation of motion for a pendulum with arbitrary periodic excitation .",
    "section  [ sec : reduce ] also gives an approximate expression for the onset of rotations that is valid for all shapes of excitation if the forcing frequency @xmath3 is large .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] shows how the non - dimensionalized equation of motion is related to the original equation of motion describing a physical pendulum driven by a slider along an ellipse .",
    "section  [ sec : bifoverview ] and section  [ sec : rot ] give two - parameter overviews of changes to the classical structure of resonance tongues and to the existence regions of rotations .",
    "section  [ sec:1d ] shows one - parameter bifurcation diagrams ( for increasing forcing amplitude ) to illustrate how the different attractors are connected by the bifurcations shown in the figures [ fig : paraspaces_oscs ] and [ fig : paraspaces_rots ] .",
    "let us assume that the pivot of the pendulum is driven periodically with high frequency along an arbitrary path",
    ". then the inclination angle @xmath7 of the pendulum is governed by the equation of motion @xmath8 where the two coordinates of the force on the pendulum bob caused by the displacement of the pivot and by gravity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , have period @xmath11 .",
    "the high - frequency regime is the parameter range where the frequency @xmath3 is large .",
    "the effect of high - frequency elliptic excitation on small amplitude oscillations has been studied analytically recently using averaging techniques @xcite . in the high - frequency regime",
    "the excitation forces are typically large , even if the excitation amplitude of the pivot ( for example , the size of the ellipse in figure  [ fig : parapendulum ] ) is small .",
    "thus , we have put the scaling factor @xmath3 expressly in front of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and assume that @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of order @xmath16 ( this corresponds to an excitation amplitude of order @xmath17 for the pivot ) .",
    "rotations of the pendulum in the positive direction ( @xmath18 ) with a frequency close to the forcing frequency are solutions of for which the quantity @xmath19 is bounded for all times .",

    "all coefficients in are at most of order @xmath16 , and the periodic terms that have been dropped in the averaging procedure are of order @xmath17 .",
    "thus , for a large frequency @xmath3 , only the first fourier coefficients of the excitation , @xmath26 , have an influence at the leading order .",
    "we can assume that one of the four leading fourier coefficients is zero without loss of generality ( we can shift time to make , for example , @xmath27 ) , and introduce three parameters to describe the other three coefficients : @xmath28 where @xmath29 can be large ( of order @xmath3 ) and @xmath30 $ ] .",

    "the stability properties of the equilibrium @xmath36 also transfer to the rotation @xmath7 : if @xmath36 is stable then @xmath7 is stable , if @xmath36 is a saddle then @xmath7 is a rotation of saddle - type .",
    "moreover , bifurcations of the equilibria of are also transferred : since is dissipative , only saddle - node bifurcations can occur .",
    "indeed , if @xmath40{1 +      { e}^2 - 2{e}\\sin\\alpha}}$ ] then the averaged equation has a saddle - node bifurcation , which implies that the original system has a saddle - node bifurcation of rotations at parameters nearby .",
    "if we replace @xmath33 by @xmath41 in then the equilibria of correspond to periodic rotations in the negative direction ( that is , to solutions @xmath7 of satisfying @xmath42 for all @xmath22 ) , and the sign in front of @xmath43 changes to @xmath44 in the condition for the saddle - node bifurcation . thus , for large frequency @xmath3 , periodic rotations of satisfying @xmath45 are born in a saddle - node bifurcation defined ( up to terms of order @xmath17 by @xmath46{1 +        { e}^2\\mp2{e}\\sin\\alpha}}\\ ] ] if @xmath1 and @xmath47 are of order @xmath16 and @xmath2 is of order @xmath3 .",
    "one of the rotations emerging from the saddle - node is stable and remains stable for arbitrarily large @xmath2 as long as the averaging approximation is valid .",
    "this implies that the curve of period doublings of rotations which we observed numerically ( see figure  [ fig : paraspaces_rots ] in section  [ sec : results ] ) has to grow super - linearly in @xmath2 for increasing @xmath3 . in summary , for large frequency @xmath3",
    ", we have :    1 .",
    "if the force amplitude is at most of order @xmath3 then the existence and stability of rotations is entirely determined by the first fourier mode of the excitation .",
    "2 .   a stable and a saddle - type periodic rotation satisfying @xmath48",
    "are born in a saddle - node bifurcation near parameter values given by where @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath33 define the amplitudes of the first fourier mode as given in .",
    "3 .   the stable rotation remains stable for increasing @xmath2 over a large region of parameter values of @xmath2 ( as long as @xmath2 is of similar magnitude to @xmath3 and the averaged equation is a valid approximation ) .",
    "the difference between the positive and negative directions of rotation is maximal for @xmath49 in expression for the onset of rotations .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the first harmonics form an upright ellipse .",
    "we note that one can extend the averaging technique to frequencies @xmath3 of order @xmath16 : for small damping @xmath1 and small forcing @xmath2 ( and @xmath50 ) one can average along the integral curves of the unforced and undamped pendulum .",
    "this technique was used in @xcite for the model of a parametrically driven pendulum ( @xmath5 ) and can be applied also for a forcing of general harmonic shape ( such as the elliptically driven pendulum ) . using this refined averaging we found that for small damping ( @xmath51 ) the expression for the saddle - node bifurcation of rotations is a good approximation for @xmath52 ( if all quantities refer to the non - dimensionalized equation where @xmath53 ) .",
    "the numerical results in section  [ sec : results ] discuss what happens if the forcing of the pendulum deviates from the classical parametrically driven pendulum and the forcing frequency is near the main resonance tongues known from the parametric case .",
    "we excite the pendulum harmonically along a narrow ellipse .",
    "this corresponds to a choice of @xmath54 in . in and we use the convention that the angle @xmath55 corresponds to the hanging - down position of the pendulum such that the force due to gravity contributes a positive constant term to the coefficient @xmath56 in front of @xmath57 but nothing to @xmath58 .",
    "if we assume that the vertical component of the forcing is dominant then @xmath31 is significantly less than @xmath16 such that the overall forcing amplitude @xmath59{1+{e}^2}}$ ] is controlled to first order of @xmath47 by @xmath2 only since @xmath60{1+{e}^2}}\\right]_{e=0}=0\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] and @xmath47 controls the ellipticity .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 controls the inclination of the ellipses ranging between excitation along a straight line ( @xmath61 ) and the family of upright ellipses ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath33 is not identical to the inclination angle of the ellipse : for example , for @xmath61 the inclination of the straight line is determined by @xmath4 .        the extreme case of parametric excitation corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "the other extreme case of horizontal excitation , which would be singular ( @xmath63 ) with our choice of parameters , has been studied theoretically in  @xcite .",
    "the approximate expression for the onset of rotations shows that the difference betwen both directions of rotation is most prominent if the parametric excitation is perturbed into an upright ellipse ( @xmath53 in ) .",
    "thus , we restrict our numerical study in section  [ sec : results ] to the specific model , which corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "this gives rise to equation   for the elliptically excited pendulum as proposed in the introduction .",
    "figure  [ fig : parapendulum ] shows a mechanical representation of this model : a pendulum having mass @xmath64 and length @xmath65 is driven by a slider on an elliptic kinematic constraint .",
    "the slider is connected to the pendulum rod via a pin joint .",
    "the non - dimensional parameters and the non - dimensional time of model can be obtained from the corresponding quantities of the mechanical representation by the scaling @xmath66 in @xmath67 is the amplitude of the vertical displacement excitation @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the amplitude of the horizontal displacement excitation @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the driving frequency , @xmath72 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath73 is the linear natural frequency of the pendulum at the hanging - down angle @xmath55 , @xmath65 is the length of the ( mass - less ) pendulor arm , @xmath64 is the mass of the pendulum bob , and @xmath74 is the viscous damping coefficient in the mechanical representation shown in figure  [ fig : parapendulum ] .",
    "in this section we analyse how the introduction of a nonzero ellipticity @xmath47 changes the resonance structure by constructing two - parameter bifurcation diagrams in the @xmath75-plane .",
    "we also use cross - sections of these diagrams ( one - parameter bifurcation diagrams ) at constant frequencies @xmath3 to make the connection between the different dynamical regimes visible . throughout our study",
    "the bifurcation parameters are the excitation frequency @xmath3 , the excitation amplitude @xmath2 and the ellipticity @xmath4 of the excitation .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 perturbs the reflection symmetry of the parametrically driven pendulum in the following way : if @xmath76 is a solution for @xmath4 then @xmath77 is a solution for @xmath78 .",
    "thus , for any ellipticity @xmath4 the bifurcations obtained for @xmath4 are identical to those obtained for @xmath78 .",

    "direct bifurcation analysis for experiments is a challenging task that may require the development of entirely new experimental methods .",
    "apart from this lack of experimental verification , other open questions are : the high - frequency approximation suggests that for a circular excitation ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) rotations against the base excitation are impossible regardless of the level of forcing and damping .",
    "this is not true in general for lower frequency and sufficiently small damping .",
    "thus , we expect that , depending on the shape of the excitation , there must be a critical damping level below which rotations against the excitation direction become possible for a suitable range of the excitation amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "the small dissipation restricts the type of bifurcations and regimes encountered in the system ( for example , torus bifurcations are impossible ) .",
    "we expect that even a small amount of interaction between the pendulum and the base ( @xcite ) will lead to large regions in the frequency - forcing plane where one can observe quasi - periodicity .",
    "escape from a potential well tends to lead to indeterminacy as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the precise sequence of heteroclinic tangencies leading to escape from the potential well is still largely unknown even for the parametrically excited pendulum .",
