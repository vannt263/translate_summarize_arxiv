    "the theory of gibbs states in physics and mathematics led to the notion of the pressure function and its variational formula for dynamical systems ( ruelle 1967 , @xcite and walters 1975 , @xcite ) .",
    "since then a variety of results has been published to clarify existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states maximizing the pressure , and this note is in the same spirit .",
    "the classical condition for uniqueness of the equilibrium state requires summable variations and was relaxed by bowen ( @xcite ) using a condition which is named after him .",
    "this has been further investigated by walters 1978 ( @xcite ) who introduced a slightly stronger condition , which is referred to as walters condition , see also @xcite .",
    "yuri in 1998 ( @xcite ) coined the term weak bounded variation and also showed uniqueness . for many classes of maps on compact spaces uniqueness",
    "has been proved as well , as a recent examples for this , climenhaga and thompson in 2013 ( @xcite ) used a restricted bowen condition , and iommi and todd ( @xcite ) studied the existence of phase transitions for grid potentials ( see @xcite ) on full shift spaces .",
    "we finally mention sarig s work in 2001 ( @xcite ) which opened a new field of studying this question on countable subshifts ( the non - compact case ) using gurevic pressure , or , for a more general approach to pressure , the notion introduced by stratmann and urbaski in 2007 ( @xcite ) .    in expansive dynamical systems an equilibrium state always exists , leading to the problem of uniqueness and continuity properties of the density of the equilibrium state with respect to _ canonical _ measures .",
    "these canonical measures may be defined as conformal measures ( in many cases the eigenmeasure of the ruelle operator associated to the normalized potential or simply gibbs measures on shift spaces ) or - as we show below - product measures ( for example a bernoulli measure on shift spaces ) .    in this note",
    "we deal with a dynamical system @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the shift transformation on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a finite or countable set , called the alphabet of the dynamics , and where @xmath9 is equipped with the product topology of pointwise convergence and the associated borel @xmath10-field .",
    "we consider potential functions @xmath11 which can be written in the form @xmath12 and call these functions of product type ( see section [ sec : producttype ] ) , where @xmath13 are fixed functions so that the sum converges .",
    "although @xmath0 is given by a sum ( possibly a series ) the terminology product type is convenient because the function @xmath14 appearing in the ruelle operator can be naturally represented by a product ( possibly an infinity product ) .    given a function @xmath15 the ruelle operator @xmath16 acts on bounded measurable functions if @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "the initial motivation for the present note was to show the existence of positive measurable eigenfunctions of @xmath19 and obtain criteria for its continuity ( see @xcite for details ) . in section [ notb ] , we show that , for a continuous potential @xmath0 less regular than a bowen potential , the eigenfunction might oscillate between @xmath20 and @xmath21 on any open set ( see theorem [ theorem : oscilation ] ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is of product type , the function @xmath22 appearing in the ruelle operator ( [ eq : ruelle ] ) has indeed a product structure .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath19 and its dual act on functions with a product structure and product measures , respectively .",
    "these basic observations permit explicit representations of eigenfunctions , conformal measures and equilibrium states ( which are of possible interest in connection with computer experiments or applications in mathematical physics ) .",
    "there are examples of potentials of product type which belong to bowen s and walters class ( see @xcite ) , but also examples having less regularity properties than potentials in these two classes .",
    "we consider the following classes of potentials of product type .",
    "we say that @xmath22 is _ @xmath23-bounded _",
    "if @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 and is _ summable _ if @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 is a _ balanced potential _ , if @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "note that the first condition is equivalent to the condition that @xmath30 is uniformly bounded .",
    "combined with summability , this implies that @xmath31 , independently of @xmath8 being finite or not .",
    "a balanced potential may be considered as a kind of normal form for potentials of product type .",
    "these conditions on potentials of product type can be used to describe the properties of the corresponding ruelle operator .",
    "we obtain the following results for the existence of conformal and equilibrium measures under rather weak assumptions .",
    "if @xmath32 , then there is an explicitly given product measure which is @xmath33-conformal ( theorem [ theo : existence ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath27 is summable and @xmath23-bounded , then there exists an explicitly given bernoulli measure which is an equilibrium state .    in order to obtain uniqueness of these measures",
    ", we have to impose bowen s condition .",
    "we say that @xmath22 is in _",
    "bowen s class _ if @xmath34 is of locally bounded distortion ( see proposition [ prop_walters_bowen_yuri ] ) .",
    "that is , there exists @xmath35 , referred to as index , such that @xmath36 if bowen s condition holds for @xmath37 , observe that a summable and balanced potential automatically is locally bounded . under these assumptions , we show that there exists an explicitly given continuous eigenfunction of @xmath38 ( theorem [ theo : eigenfunction - abstract ] ) and , if @xmath8 is finite , that the conformal measure and the equilibrium state are unique ( theorems [ theo : uniqueness ] , [ theo : equilibrium ] ) .    beyond bowen",
    "s condition , the situation is very different .",
    "if @xmath39 is finite and for some @xmath40 , @xmath41 there are three canonical measures , first the conformal measure @xmath42 for @xmath33 , secondly the equilibrium measure @xmath43 and last the measure of maximal entropy @xmath44 .",
    "all three measures are bernoulli ( i.e. the coordinate process is independent ) and @xmath42 and @xmath45 are absolutely continuous with respect to each other .",
    "moreover , there exist functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 which may exist only almost surely , but these functions are eigenfunctions for the action of the operator on @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) , respectively .",
    "the relationship between @xmath51 and the equilibrium measure is explained by ergodicity of a natural operator on @xmath52 defined by @xmath43 .    in order to illustrate the results we will study an explicit example in section [ exa ] . in there",
    ", we consider the potential @xmath1 of the form @xmath53 which is a summable , locally bounded and balanced potential for @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is in bowen s class , and for @xmath56 , condition is satisfied .",
    "for the latter case , we obtain that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are locally unbounded and therefore discontinuous .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath59 , these eigenfunctions do not exist and the measures @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are pairwise singular .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : topology ] , we recall the regularity classes of bowen , walters and yuri adapted to the setting of potentials of product type . in our setting , the classes of bowen and walters coincide , and in particular , the existence of conformal measures and continuous eigenfunctions for finite @xmath8 could also be obtained by results in @xcite . for completeness ,",
    "we give conditions for a potential of product type to be in yuri s class , although we do not prove results under this regularity hypothesis in this paper .",
    "this is due to the fact that the results by yuri rely on a tower construction whose associated potential is of bounded variation - or , from a more abstract viewpoint , on the existence of an isolated critical set or isolated indifferent fixed points .    in section [ sec : producttype ]",
    ", we then provide a very general condition for the existence of a conformal measure and a condition for uniqueness .",
    "these results essentially rely on the observation that the radon - nikodym derivative of a measure of product type is a function of product type , and an ergodicity argument , respectively . in section [ sec : eigenfunctions of product type ] , we explicitly construct eigenfunctions and equilibrium states , including the existence only @xmath44-almost everywhere when bowen s condition is not satisfied and where @xmath44 denotes the measure of maximal entropy . this",
    "is extended in the following section to the action of the ruelle operator on @xmath60 for certain product measures and a condition for the uniqueness of @xmath51 is given .",
    "section [ exa ] is then dedicated to the analysis of the above mentioned example .",
    "in order to adapt the conditions by bowen , walters and yuri to functions of product type we begin specifying a metric on @xmath7 . for @xmath61 , let @xmath62 as it is well known , @xmath63 generates the product topology of pointwise convergence and @xmath64 is a complete metric space which is compact if and only if @xmath39 is finite .",
    "the cylinder sets form a basis of this topology , where , for a @xmath40-word @xmath65 , the associated cylinder set is defined by @xmath66 : = \\{(y_n)_{n\\ge 1 } \\in x : y_i = x_i \\forall i=1,\\ldots , k\\}$ ] .",
    "the shift on @xmath9 is defined by @xmath67 and , as it is well known , is a continuous transformation which expands distances by 2 . in order to put emphasis on the underlying topology and borel @xmath10-algebra , we will refer to @xmath68 as a _ topological bernoulli _ shift over the alphabet @xmath39 .    using a slightly different notation as in @xcite , for a function @xmath69",
    "we let @xmath70 denote the variation of @xmath71 over cylinders of length @xmath72",
    ". then @xmath71 has summable variations ( @xcite ) if @xmath73 to simplify the notation we write @xmath74 . in the sequel",
    "we define some regularity classes in terms of the decay of @xmath75 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath76 belongs to    1 .",
    "walters class ( @xcite ) if @xmath77 , 2 .   bowen s class ( @xcite )",
    "if @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , 3 .",
    "yuri s class ( @xcite ) if @xmath80 .",
    "it has been remarked in @xcite that the definition of bowen s class given here is equivalent to bowen s original definition .",
    "observe that for shift spaces , walters condition is equivalent to equicontinuity of the family @xmath81 , whereas bowen s condition provides a uniform local bound on the local distortion of @xmath82 .",
    "yuri s condition is also known as weak bounded variation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now deduce necessary conditions for functions of product type to belong to these classes .",
    "assume that @xmath83 is of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a sequence such that @xmath86 converges for all @xmath87 and set @xmath88    [ prop_walters_bowen_yuri ] for @xmath0 of product type as above , the following holds .    1 .   if @xmath89 then @xmath0 has summable variation .",

    "moreover , the estimate @xmath106 implies that @xmath107 . in particular , @xmath108 .",
