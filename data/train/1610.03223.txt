    "growing interest is manifesting itself in nonequilibrium processes during electron transport in , or through , small systems in photon cavities.@xcite diverse aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum systems have often been investigated using master equations of various types , tailored to the task at hand.@xcite for the description of the transient time regime , immediately following a `` switch - on '' of a perturbation of the environment such as coupling to leads , or a photon / phonon bath , generalized master equations ( gme ) have prevailed .",

    "[ eigenspectrum_l ]         for a closed system the liouville spectrum has only real eigenvalues reflecting all possible bohr frequencies of the system .",
    "in the case of an open system we can view the spectrum as displaying all transitions and their respective life times . with this in mind",

    "in this article we present a general computational framework for calculating a markovian solution of a nakajima - zwanzig equation in liouville space for a complex open quantum system .",
    "this framework is diligently derived by observing how the markov approximation can be expressed algebraically such that an algorithmic composition becomes evident . using this framework",
    "we can effectively calculate the time evolution of the system at all time scales without having to resort to a time consuming numerical integration of the equation of motion .",
    "we have displayed the value of this approach for an electron system weakly coupled to external leads , but strongly coupled to far - infrared photons of a cavity , in which the electron system is embedded .",
    "both the weak coupling to the leads and the frequency of the cavity photons can lead to very long relaxation times that can not be ignored in the system .",
    "even though we implement the markovian approximation and the mapping of the problem to liouville space for a particular model in the weak coupling to the environment , nothing in our scheme is dependent on this model .",
    "the markovian solution becomes attainable by introducing a matrix of dirac measures which selects the relevant many - body state transitions describing the evolution of our system .",
    "the fact that we can analyse the time evolution of an open electron system by `` exactly interacting '' few electrons and many photons in a nontrivial geometry opens up the possibility to investigate many regimes of interesting physical phenomena that are not easily accessible to simpler model systems .",
    "in this appendix , we explain how the sparse matrix representations of dissipative factors in liouville space can be generated computationally .",
    "this is accomplished by showing that the block matrix structure of these factors , which emerges from the markovian form , can be derived in a clear and an efficient manner .",
    "it can be seen that the dirac measures enforce a diagonal dominance in the sparse matrix structure , by eliminating either off - diagonal block matrix components or off - block - diagonal elements .",
    "this property can be exploited to derive a simple algorithm for the compilation of dissipative terms in the truncated liouville space .",
    "first , we give a comprehensive description of how the nakajima - zwanzig equation can be compiled by disseminating the total liouvillian @xmath0 into its respective terms .",
    "the sparse matrix representation of the generator @xmath0 is obtained as a linear combination of kronecker tensor products describing the unitary evolution of the system , as well as the dissipative factors given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zi ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) .    for this , we shall describe the process explicitly in terms of the block matrix structure of the factors of @xmath0 .",
    "not only does this provide a mathematical convenience , it also reveals a simple structure which can be explored in a computational manner .",
    "first , blockmatrix @xmath156 of the positive term , given by the unitary evolution for the system is expressed as , @xmath157 i.e.  as a block diagonal matrix .",
    "here , each block matrix on the diagonal represents the hamiltonian for a given transition in liouville space .",
    "the block matrices are elements in a subspace of the @xmath72-truncated fock space .",
    "the negative term of the unitary evolution is expressed by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the identity and @xmath160 is the @xmath161 component of the system hamiltonian . here ,",
    "each of the block matrices is an @xmath72 diagonal blockmatrix containing information about the states corresponding to its block matrix number .",
    "the dissipative terms can also be written in this way from the sparse markovian description given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zi ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "whereas , a mixed multiple of factors such as , @xmath162 , would , in the non - markovian case , break down the ` simple ' sparse description given for the unitary evolution , the diagonal action of the dirac matrix eliminates components which would otherwise contribute to the evolution .",
    "moreover , this elimination of terms can be exploited , for each of the dissipative factors such that they can be compiled effectively with time complexity @xmath163 .",
    "importantly , this compilation can be performed in parallel for all factors thus enabling very fast calculations .",
    "here , a diagonal dirac blockmatrix @xmath165 measures any transition to the many body state @xmath86 . acting from the left",
    ", it applies the measure to each column of an operator , but to each row if acting from the right . for the transpose of the dirac delta , diagonal blockmatrix number @xmath166 measures",
    "any transition from the many - body state @xmath86 .            from this description",
    "it can be seen that the block matrices of @xmath170 are block - diagonal matrices given by , @xmath171 and their components are as given by the description provided in eq .",
    "( [ eq : componentdescription ] ) .",
    "the way this can be accomplished is seen from the block matrix structure of the components presented in eq .",

    "@xmath176 in liouville space , for each bohr frequency .",
    "this results in a registry of @xmath177 many values , denoted by taureg . for the scalar function @xmath175 we have a registry of @xmath73 , denoted by dreg .",
