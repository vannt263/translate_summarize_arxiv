    "computing resources available for simulations of lattice qcd are now powerful enough to investigate unquenching effects .",
    "ukqcd has embarked on a programme of studying these effects in the light hadron spectrum , static quark potential , glueball spectrum and topological sectors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate unquenching effects in the first of these areas .",
    "it is well known that the lattice cut - off is a function of _ both _ the gauge coupling , @xmath0 , and dynamical quark mass , @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the philosophy we have chosen is to simulate at points along the `` matched '' trajectory in the @xmath2 plane i.e. defined by_fixed _ lattice spacing , @xmath3 .",
    "this then disentangles lattice spacing artefacts with unquenching effects .",
    "any variation of a physical quantity along this trajectory can sensibly be attributed to unquenching effects rather than lattice systematics .",
    "this work has been published in full in @xcite .",

    "this paper attempts to uncover unquenching effects in the dynamical lattice qcd simulations at a fixed ( matched ) lattice spacing ( and volume ) and various dynamical quark masses .",
    "this approach allows a more controlled study of unquenching effects without the possible entanglement of lattice and unquenching systematics .    however , we see no significant sign of unquenching effects in the meson spectrum . this is presumably since our dynamical quarks are relatively massive , and",
    "so the meson spectrum is dominated by the static quark potential .",
    "this potential is , by definition , matched amongst our ensembles at the hadronic length scale @xmath4 , and so any variation of the meson spectrum within our matched ensemble must surely be a `` higher '' order unquenching effect which is beyond our present statistics .",
    "we have however shown that unquenching effects exist in the static quark potential , and other work ( using the same ensembles ) has shown interesting unquenching effects in the glueball and topological sector @xcite ."
