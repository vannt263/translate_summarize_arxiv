    "recently , there have been interesting discussions on the information loss problem of black holes @xcite .",
    "it has been clearly exposed that one can not consistently hold on to general relativity , semi - classical quantum field theory , area - entropy relation , and unitarity all at the same time @xcite .",
    "this means that for a certain stage some of the well - established physical principles should breakdown , not only at singularities but also at very large scales . among various ideas to address this problem ,",
    "there is a proposal to drop general relativity introducing the so - called firewall @xcite .",
    "however , if there is a firewall , then it should affect the future infinity and hence that seems very problematic @xcite .",
    "an interesting approach to investigate this problem is via the wave function of the universe that satisfies the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "if the universe is in the ground state , then the wave function can be computed by an euclidean path - integral .",
    "one can approximate the path - integral as a sum over on - shell histories which are either lorentzian or euclidean , where the latter are called instantons .",
    "namely an instanton is a classical trajectory over the complexified time that connects the initial state to one of the final states . for a given initial state",
    ", the wave function behaves as a propagator and the final state will be a superposition of various semi - classical states .    according to maldacena @xcite and hawking @xcite ,",
    "if one of the histories has a trivial topology , namely that there is no horizon nor singularity in the lorentzian sense , then the information will be eventually conserved through the history , even though the probability is suppressed on the order of the entropy .",
    "this might explain why there is no information loss for the entire wave function of the universe , yet a semi - classical observer , who can see a definite geometry , would effectively detect the loss of information .",
    "it might well be that a unitary observer , if any , who lives in the superspace , could approximately describe classical observables as expectation values , where these expectation values do not have to satisfy the classical equations of motion . in this sense",
    ", there could be a violation of general relativity .",
    "but in this scenario there is no physical firewall for a semi - classical observer @xcite .    while this framework from the path - integral , so - called the _ effective loss of information _ , is very appealing ,",
    "more justifications are needed .",
    "possible issues of the effective loss of information are the following :    * is the existence of an instanton that mediates a trivial geometry _",
    "generic _ ?",
    "* can one technically demonstrate the _ expectation values _ of observables in terms of a unitary observer ?",
    "* is the existence of a trivial geometry really _ sufficient _ to explain unitarity ?    if we can answer these questions positively , the effective loss of information will be a genuine answer for the information loss paradox .    in this paper ,",
    "we want to address the first question : _ is the existence of such an instanton generic _ ?",
    "up to now , we are not yet able to answer this question , but we can at least find interesting and quite generic examples regarding this within the thin - shell approximation @xcite . if a shell is self - gravitating and has a time - symmetric solution , then there is a hope to find a tunneling channel that links a collapsing shell to a bouncing shell toward a trivial geometry @xcite . in order to obtain a trivial geometry within the thin - shell approximation",
    ", we need the following conditions :    * there should be time - symmetric collapsing and bouncing solutions . * at the bouncing point , the extrinsic curvature of the shell should be positive .",
    "* the shell should start with a regular initial condition and approach to a time - symmetric collapsing solution .",
    "the existence of thin - shell solutions that satisfy c1 and c2 has already been shown in the literature @xcite , while c3 was simply put in by hand . however , in order to make our argument more generic , we need to weaken these conditions . regarding c3 , for realistic star interiors , there exist various repulsive effects that can be well approximated by a modification of the tension term ( for more detailed analytic descriptions of gravitational collapses , see @xcite ) . in this paper , by modifying the tension around the star regime , we see that the realization of a regular initial condition that smoothly approaches a maximum radius is definitely reasonable and possible .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bri ] , we briefly summarize the idea on the effective loss of information . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] , we investigate true vacuum bubbles in asymptotic anti - de sitter ( ads ) and minkowski backgrounds .",
    "we construct some examples that have stable or unstable stationary points by varying the tension term . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , we summarize our results and discuss on future topics . some useful but supplementary analyses are given in appendix . throughout this paper , we assume the units @xmath0 , while in some special cases we explicitly recover the constants .",
    "the propagator from the initial state @xmath1 to the final state @xmath2 can be described by the path integral @xmath3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the metric , @xmath5 is a matter field , and @xmath6 is the lorentzian action .",
    "the final state , which is located at future infinity , is represented by a superposition of classical states @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 , if one assumes the classicality of the wave function for an asymptotic observer .    in general , this lorentzian path integral badly diverges .",
    "however , according to hartle and hawking @xcite , an analytic continuation of the time from lorentzian signatures to euclidean signatures will improve its behavior and the analytically continued path integral will correspond to the ground state wave function .",
    "this euclidean path integral is presented by @xmath9},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath10 is the euclidean action and we sum over all euclidean paths that connect @xmath1 to @xmath7 .",
    "still , the whole path integral is difficult to solve exactly .",
    "nevertheless , one can extract information about the ground state of the wave function by using the steepest - descent approximation , since in a semiclassical regime , euclidean classical solutions ( instantons ) give the dominant contribution . in this approximation ,",
    "one sums over instantons , namely @xmath11 thus , the exponential gives a rough estimation on the tunneling rate from @xmath1 to @xmath7 .    to be concrete , imagine a situation where the initial state defined on the past infinity @xmath1 contains a collapsing matter that will classically form a black hole , and let us call it @xmath12 .",
    "note that under the path integral approach , @xmath12 will not be in general the unique final state ; in other words , @xmath1 may undergo quantum tunneling .",
    "ideally , if there exists a history with a trivial geometry , say from @xmath1 to @xmath13 , which has no singularity nor event horizon , then every information of the initial state @xmath1 will be conserved through this history . in fact ,",
    "this point was previously discussed by maldacena @xcite and hawking @xcite .",
    "the main idea is as follows : although the probability for @xmath13 is exponentially suppressed compared to @xmath12 , the two point correlation function between inside and outside the horizon does not decay to zero .",
    "thus , information will be eventually recovered through the trivial geometry @xcite .",
    "if this idea is general enough , then we might say that a unitary observer who can see the superposition of states @xmath2 will restore all information , while a semiclassical observer will see a particular classical state , say @xmath7 , and will effectively lose information .",
    "this is the reason why this approach is called the _ effective loss of information_. it should be noted that a unitary observer need not satisfy classical equations of motion ( general relativity included ) .",
    "now , the question is whether the previous idea could be applicable for generic matter - gravity systems .",
    "we devote the following sections to find concrete examples where an instanton connects a collapsing matter to a trivial geometry .",
    "we consider a spherical thin - shell located at @xmath14 that divides two spacetime regions with the spherical symmetric metric ansatz ( for a review of the thin - shell formalism , see @xcite ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 refer to outside ( @xmath17 ) and inside ( @xmath18 ) the shell , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic metric of the thin - shell is given by @xmath19 we take the metric ansatz for outside and inside the shell to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass parameters of each region and @xmath23 is the parameter due to the vacuum energy @xmath24 . in this section ,",
    "we focus on minkowski and ads background and consider true vacuum bubbles , but it can be easily generalized to a ds background . for our purposes",
    "we assume @xmath25 , unless stated otherwise , and therefore the internal manifold does not have a singularity .",
    "the equation of motion of the thin - shell is determined by the junction equation @xcite : @xmath26 where an overdot refers to the derivative with respect to the shell time @xmath27 , @xmath28 denote the outward normal direction of outside and inside the shell , respectively , and @xmath29 is the surface energy density or tension of the shell .",
    "it should be noted that the tension @xmath29 is in general a function of @xmath14 , which satisfies the conservation of the energy that is given by @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface pressure .",
    "the behavior of the tension with respect to @xmath14 is determined once an equation of state is given ( for a study of the thin - shell dynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions for various equations of state see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if we assume a constant equation of state , i.e. @xmath32 , then we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "in addition , if the shell is constructed by a couple of fields with various equations of state , then we can further generalize it as @xmath35 where @xmath36s are constants and @xmath37 corresponds equations of state .",
    "the most natural realization of this model comes from a scalar field that gives the condition @xmath38 ( and hence a constant tension ) @xcite . for the large @xmath14 limit",
    ", this gives the dominant contribution .",
    "however , for the small @xmath14 regime , there could be important contributions from other fields with different equations of states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after some calculations , we reduce the junction equation to a simpler formula @xcite : @xmath39 this effective potential determines the dynamics of the shell , where the classically allowed region is limited by @xmath40 . thus , the number of zeros of the potential especially determines the details .",
    "if there is no zero , then the only allowed solution is an _",
    "asymmetric _ expanding or collapsing shell that connects between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , if there are four zeros ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pots ] ) , then these zeros would determine the turning points of the motion of the shell , i.e. , where @xmath43 . due to presence of these turning points",
    ", we find the following possibilities ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pots ] ) :    * _ symmetric collapsing solution _ : starting from @xmath41 at @xmath44 , approaching the turning point ( maximum radius ) , and finally going to @xmath41 at @xmath45 . *",
    "_ symmetric bouncing solution _ : starting from @xmath42 at @xmath44 , approaching the turning point ( minimum radius ) , and finally going to @xmath42 at @xmath45 .",
    "* _ oscillatory solution _ : oscillating between two turning points ( a minimum and a maximum radius ) .",
    "in addition , we add two extreme cases of the last possibility where two turning points merge into a single one ( lower left and right of fig .  [",
    "fig : pots ] ) :    * _ stable stationary solution _ : a solution where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "such a stationary solution is classically stable but will eventually either collapse or expand due to quantum effects . * _ unstable stationary solution _ : if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then the solution is stationary at a certain radius , but an infinitesimally small perturbation will induce either collapse or expansion ; sometimes such a solution may be relevant as a thermal instanton @xcite .",
    "examples of effective potentials , where there are two ( upper left ) , three ( lower ) , and four ( upper right ) zeros . ]    in this paper , we mainly focus on a tunneling channel corresponding to a bouncing solution that results in a trivial geometry without a singularity or an event horizon . previously , several authors have found some examples @xcite , but these examples were associated with a symmetric collapsing solution .",
    "one potential problem with the symmetric collapsing solution is that it should start from @xmath41 and hence from a singularity and a white hole .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such a region is not physical ; if it does not have to satisfy the singularity theorem , then there can be a way to smoothen such an initial condition so that the initial state can be void of singularity .",
    "on the other hand , the initial condition for the gravitational collapse of a real star is very complicated . to avoid such complications , we focus on the role of oscillatory and stationary solutions .",
    "these of course are not realistic models of gravitational collapse .",
    "nevertheless , studying them is still meaningful in that it can explicitly deal with gravitational collapse geometries from regular initial configurations .",
    "our task is therefore to find a model where its effective potential @xmath50 has four zeros to allow for symmetric collapsing solutions , symmetric bouncing solutions , and oscillating solutions ; then as extreme cases , we can obtain a stable or unstable stationary solution .    before going in depth ,",
    "let us explicitly recover the signs of @xmath51 parameters by comparing extrinsic curvatures : @xmath52 it is easy to see that whenever @xmath53 @xmath54 is positive .",
    "we will make use of these fact in following sections .",
    "we dedicate this section to analyze the system and to build the previously discussed solutions .",
    "essentially , we need to take into account two facts . first , the classification of solutions is directly related to the number of zeros of the potential .",
    "second , the causal structure is determined by the sign of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "thus , we are interested in the case when the potential has four zeros ( or three zeros with one degenerate zero ) and the extrinsic curvatures on both sides of the shell are positive for @xmath14 larger than the event horizon , i.e. @xmath55 for @xmath56 where @xmath57 .    in other words ,",
    "we want a stationary or oscillating thin - shell to tunnel to a trivial geometry with the resultant shell located at somewhere outside of the original shell and expanding to infinity , which is the one relevant to the future observer .",
    "below , we first discuss how to tune the tension @xmath29 so as to fulfill the above conditions .",
    "then we present a couple of specific examples .",
    "solutions to @xmath58 under the mentioned requirements are reduced to those satisfying @xmath59 thus , if one looks for @xmath60 zeros , one must choose the tension @xmath29 such that it satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeros ] ) @xmath60 times .",
    "let us have a rough intuition on the qualitative behavior of the function @xmath61 in a near horizon , intermediate and far regions .",
    "we assume @xmath62 for simplicity . near the event horizon @xmath63 , since we have @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65 on the other hand , in the intermediate region where @xmath66 , a series expansion yields @xmath67",
    "lastly , for large @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 where it should be noted that the right - hand side is positive because @xmath70 for true vacuum bubbles . in this way , we have a crude idea on how @xmath61 behaves and we can extract some conditions on the tension .    before going into details , let us review the asymptotically flat case @xcite , namely @xmath71 , and graphically explain the tension building as we base our intuition on this set up . first , by a simple analysis , it can be shown that in the asymptotically flat case one can always find a constant tension which yields two zeros of the potential .",
    "necessary _ condition extracted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym22 ] ) is @xmath72 for the asymptotically ads case , we expect a similar condition on @xmath73 , namely @xmath74    as seen explicitly from fig .",
    "[ fig : qualitative ] , a constant tension line ( dashed black line ) crosses @xmath61 ( red curve ) twice , one in the large @xmath14 region and the other in the @xmath66 region where @xmath61 starts to behave as @xmath75 .",
    "let us denote the positions of these two zeros by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the blue curve shows the upper bound on @xmath79 so that the extrinsic curvature is positive at any @xmath14 greater than @xmath80 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper ] ) ) . that ensures the presence of two zeros . in fact",
    ", since @xmath81 for @xmath82 and the equality holds only at the horizon , the existence of a zero in the large @xmath14 region guarantees that of another zero in the intermediate region .",
    "thus we first choose the constant part of the tension that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond2 ] ) .",
    "afterwards , we modify the tension at @xmath83 , around the @xmath75 region , so as to have the resulting curve ( black curve ) intersect the red curve two more times , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : qualitative ] .",
    "this can be achieved if one choose the tension to behave as @xmath84 with @xmath85 at @xmath83 and , hence , the product @xmath86 has a steeper gradient than @xmath61 as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "this condition is equivalent to requiring the equation of state of the shell to cross the value @xmath87 , as one can see from evaluating @xmath88     qualitative behavior of @xmath89 ( red ) , @xmath90 ( blue ) and @xmath79 ( black ) for true vacuum bubbles in ads background .",
    "a constant tension @xmath29 ( black dashed line ) can give rise to two zeros of the potential at most .",
    "four zeros could be obtained by modifying the tension at small @xmath14 ( black line ) .",

    "what we achieved in this paper can be summarized as follows :    * in the time - symmetric solution , there is a part of the initial singularity and the white hole horizon .",
    "however , the initial singularity is _ not _ the essential feature ; we can explicitly construct a model that does not start from an initial singularity . * for realistic gravitational collapse",
    ", there can be much diverse ( maybe , infinite number of ) branching channels toward a trivial geometry , where each process will be exponentially suppressed with the exponent given by the order of the entropy @xmath163 .",
    "* we constructed a classically stable thin - shell example . in this case , the probability that forms a black hole and that expands to infinity will be _ both _ exponentially suppressed ( though that depends on the tension ) .",
    "the two probabilities will be unsuppressed and of the same order when the mass becomes the planck scale , i.e. , when the `` fuzziness '' of the geometry becomes important .",
    "we found various parameters that allow both collapsing and bouncing solutions .",
    "while this may not be the most general case , these parameters seem quite natural and therefore allowed .",
    "this suggests that we may go one step forward toward a _",
    "generic _ behavior of the wave function of the universe .",
    "one must bear in mind that we are dealing with a broad class of examples but still it is no definite proof that there always exists an instanton that mediates a trivial geometry . however , if this generic statement were to be proven someday , then we might reach a solution to the information loss paradox through the euclidean path integral approach .",
