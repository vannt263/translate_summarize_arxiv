    "the type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) is one of the brightest events in the universe , and plays an important role as a cosmological distance indicator .",
    "it is widely accepted that an sn  ia is a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) , and that the explosion is triggered by interaction between the co  wd and its companion star @xcite .",
    "however , it is still controversial whether the companion star is a non - degenerate star ( single degenerate scenario ; sd ) @xcite , or a degenerate star ( double degenerate scenario ; dd ) @xcite .",
    "there are other scenarios , for example , core degenerate ( cd ) scenario in which the companion is an asymptotic giant branch core @xcite , and collisional dd scenario in which two co  wds collide in a dense stellar cluster , or in a multiple stellar system @xcite .",
    "the sd scenario has been well tested by recent observations ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "there are multiple observational indications , some of which are for the sd scenario and the others are against it , for different objects .",
    "the observational studies against the sd scenario include the following : @xcite have detected no red giant star in the deep pre - explosion images of the site of sn  2011fe .",
    "@xcite have reported that no main sequence or red giant stars are observed at the central region of an sn  ia remnant , snr  0509 - 67.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations supporting the sd scenario include the following : @xcite have observed sn ia ptf  11kx , and have found the evidence of a strong interaction between the sn ejecta and circumstellar matter ( csm ) . here , the csm is thought to originate from a symbiotic nova , which consists of a wd and a red giant star .",
    "as described above , the sd scenario has been directly tested by many studies . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the ` observational ' support for the dd scenario indeed come from ` non - detection '  it is supported since the sd scenario is ruled out for particular objects .",
    "it is therefore necessary to assess the dd scenario directly , based on theoretical predictions of what should be observed if the dd scenario is the case . for this purpose",
    ", the following two questions should be answered : ( 1 ) whether a co  wd which accretes materials from a companion co  wd results in a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "( 2 ) whether such an explosion is observed as an sn  ia .",
    "many previous studies have focused on the first question , finding many possible paths in which a primary co  wd could explode .",
    "these models can be generally divided into the chandrasekhar mass and sub - chandrasekhar mass models . in the chandrasekhar mass model , the co  wd reaches the central density higher than a critical density to ignite explosive carbon burning , whereas it is not the case for the sub - chandrasekhar mass model .    in the chandrasekhar mass model ,",
    "two co  wds merge , and the merger remnant evolves hydrostatically after the merger toward an explosion . whether the merger remnant explodes as an sn ia depends on the structure of the merger remnant .",
    "this structure has been intensively investigated by means of two different numerical schemes : smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations @xcite and mesh - based hydrodynamics simulations @xcite . among these works",
    ", @xcite have found a path to the sn ia explosion .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite have performed large parameter surveys for various binary co  wd parameters , and have searched for the systems which can explode as an sn ia .",
    "the sub - chandrasekhar mass model can be subdivided into several categories .",
    "first , @xcite have suggested a ` carbon - ignited violent merger model ' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model , hotspots appear in the course of the merger of binary co  wds , and generate carbon detonation leading to an explosion .",
    "second , @xcite have also propounded a ` helium - ignited violent merger model ' . in this model , a helium layer accreted onto a primary co  wd from a companion wd rises in temperature .",
    "it is suggested that the helium detonation occurs at some point in this layer , and then the shock compression triggers the carbon detonation inside the primary co  wd , leading to an explosion .",
    "this is an analog to the double detonation model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for the nature of the helium donor .",
    "finally , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have argued that binary co  wds could explode shortly after the merger due to magnetohydrodynamical effects .    in this paper , we investigate the helium - ignited violent merger , carbon - ignited violent merger , and chandrasekhar mass models from two points of view : ( 1 ) the first point is whether these models lead to a successful ignition to initiate an explosion . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform sph simulations of a merger of binary co  wds .",
    "however , we can not directly follow initiation of its explosion ; in order to follow the initiation , we need sph simulation with impossibly high space resolution , say @xmath9  cm . instead , we judge success or failure in the explosion from the density and temperature obtained through the sph simulation . especially , to investigate various possibilities in the ignition process , we adopt the following strategy : even when we infer the success of a particular mode of the ignition , we do not stop our simulation , and the sph simulation results from the subsequent evolution are used to test another mode of the ignition .",
    "this is because our inference for a particular ignition mode is not decisive , and because we want to test several models with different ignition conditions .",
    "as described above , we use temperature to infer the success or failure .",
    "however , temperature is vulnerable to random noises in sph simulations . in order to obtain robust inference ,",
    "we carefully treat temperature in the following two ways .",
    "first , we adopt two types of temperatures : raw and smoothed temperatures ( described in detail later ) .",
    "second , we do not solve nuclear reactions , which are sensitive to random noises , and could increase temperature in an unstable manner .",
    "\\(2 ) the second point is whether the expected outcome of the explosion is consistent with observations of sne  ia . for this purpose ,",
    "we adopt several observational indications .",
    "the first test is the progenitor radii of sn  2011fe and sn  2014j .",
    "the former and latter radii are inferred to be less than @xmath10 @xcite and more than @xmath11 @xcite , respectively . as another test",
    ", we discuss @xmath12ni distribution and the ejecta geometry , both of which are thought not to be highly asymmetric for nearby sne @xcite and for sn remnants .",
    "we mainly investigate a merger of a binary consisting of two co  wds with masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath13 . for a benchmark",
    ", we also follow evolution of a binary with masses of @xmath14 co  wd and @xmath15 co  wd . other combinations are investigated elsewhere @xcite .    in sum",
    ", we find that for the particular binary parameters studied in this paper , the helium- and carbon - ignited violent merger models lead to an explosion , while the chandrasekhar mass model does not , according to our inference .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , our inference is not decisive due to various uncertainties .",
    "we therefore suggest a way of evaluating our inference and constrain the fates of wd mergers , based on the insights obtained through the sph simulations .",
    "if the system indeed does not immediately lead to an sn ia explosion , the binary merger should leave its merger wd remnant and the unbound materials ejected from the system during the dynamical phase of the merger process ( hereafter ` merger ejecta ' ) .",
    "the merger ejecta interact with interstellar medium ( ism ) , and form a shell ( hereafter merger shell ) , which is analogous to formation of an sn remnant .",
    "if we find these merger remnants and merger shells , we can dismiss our inference and alternatively we can use these observational counterparts against the violent merger scenarios leading to an sn ia .",
    "we discuss the detectability of such events , in particular the merger shell .",
    "we thereby suggest that it is possible to detect such events .",
    "this discussion has another benefit .",
    "the merger shell can be detected not only from pre - explosion images of a site of an sn  ia , but also in the post - explosion observations , if the sn  ia happens in the chandrasekhar mass model .",
    "the detection of the merger shell can therefore directly support the chandrasekhar mass model as a result of the wd merger .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe the methods of our simulations . in section  [ sec : results ] , we show the results from our simulations . in section  [ sec : verification ] , we assess whether our binary co  wds can explode , and whether the explosion can be observed as an sn  ia . in section",
    "[ sec : detectability ] , we discuss the detectability of the merger remnant and merger shell .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the methods of our simulations . in section  [ sec : sph ] , we briefly present schemes in our sph simulations . in section  [ sec : define ] , we define several quantities used throughout the paper . in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we show how to set up an initial condition of binary co  wds . in section  [ sec : run ] , we summarize a set of physical and numerical parameters used in this study . in section  [ sec : environment ] , we introduce our computing environment .",
    "we solve lagrangian hydrodynamics equations with self gravity by means of sph simulations .",
    "each sph particle is evolved by the following equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the velocity , specific internal energy , pressure , and ( mass ) density of @xmath21-particle , respectively , and @xmath22 is gravity exerting on @xmath21-particle .",
    "the over - dots indicate the first time derivative .",
    "the nabla symbol means an operator of @xmath23 .",
    "we briefly explain our sph formulations . in our sph simulations",
    ", we solve the ` vanilla ice ' sph equations .",
    "we adopt a cubic spline kernel for the sph kernel interpolation .",
    "the sph kernel is modified in the same way as @xcite . similarly to @xcite , we adopt the treatment of time - dependent artificial viscosity @xcite , combined with a recipe which suppresses the viscosity from shear motion @xcite .",
    "this is described in detail in appendix  [ sec : viscosity ] .",
    "we set the length of the sph kernel of a particle , such that the arithmetic average number of neighbor particles over all the particles , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter , `` @xmath26 '' indicates an arithmetic average of quantities over all the particles .",
    "neighbor particles of @xmath21-particle , @xmath27 , are defined as particles whose distances from @xmath21-particle is less than the kernel length of @xmath21-particle .",
    "we use an equation of state ( eos ) as functions of @xmath20 and @xmath18 in order to get not only @xmath19 , but also raw temperature @xmath28 and sound speed @xmath29 . for the eos",
    ", we adopt the helmholtz eos @xcite .",
    "this eos includes thermal radiations , an ideal gas of ions , an electron - positron gas with an arbitrary degree of relativity and degeneracy .",
    "the eos requires chemical compositions of fluids .",
    "we assume that the chemical composition is uniformly fixed to @xmath30 percent of carbon , and @xmath30 percent of oxygen in the number fraction .",
    "the chemical composition is fixed during the whole simulations , since we do not consider nuclear reactions .",
    "the gravity is calculated as follows .",
    "the gravity @xmath22 is the sum of the newtonian gravity on @xmath21-particle exerted by all the other particles .",
    "we introduce so - called plummer softening to the newtonian gravity .",
    "thus , it is expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the mass and position vector of @xmath34-particle , @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath36 is the gravitational softening , fixed to @xmath37  cm . in practice , we calculate the gravity with an octree algorithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in such algorithms , gravity exerted on @xmath21-particle by distant particles is approximated as its multipole moment .",
    "we consider the multipole moment up to dipole moment . in order to define",
    "whether particles are distant or not , we use multipole acceptance condition ( mac ) .",
    "we choose the same mac as introduced by @xcite .",
    "the mac has one accuracy parameter , @xmath38 , which is the same notation as in @xcite .",
    "the accuracy parameter @xmath38 has the dimension of mass divided by square of length .",
    "as @xmath38 becomes smaller , gravity is calculated with a higher degree of accuracy . at the beginning of our simulation",
    ", we determine @xmath38 from @xmath22 at the initial time , such as @xmath39 where a relative error of gravity on a particle is ensured to be less than @xmath40 . except for @xmath41",
    ", we adopt @xmath42  g@xmath43 , which corresponds to @xmath44 . at @xmath41",
    ", we adopt @xmath45  g@xmath43 .",
    "the reason why @xmath38 at @xmath41 is extremely smaller than @xmath38 at @xmath46 is as follows .",
    "we do not know the gravity @xmath22 at @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we do not know what @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath47 at @xmath41 .",
    "in order to avoid obtaining the gravity with a relative error larger than @xmath48 , we use sufficiently small @xmath38 at @xmath41 . as a result of the calculation of the gravity at @xmath41 ,",
    "it becomes clear that @xmath49  g@xmath43 corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , we calculate the gravity with a relative error much less than @xmath48 at @xmath41 .      in this section , we define several quantities used throughout this paper .",
    "we define two types of temperatures : raw and smoothed temperatures .",
    "the raw temperature of a particle , @xmath51 , is directly obtained from the helmholtz eos as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath18 , as described in section  [ sec : sph ] .",
    "using @xmath51 , the smoothed temperature of a particle , @xmath52 , is calculated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sph kernel .",
    "this smoothed temperature is similar to `` sph - smoothed temperature '' in @xcite .",
    "we define a timescale of a nuclear reaction , @xmath55 , as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath58 is an energy generation rate per unit mass for the nuclear reaction , and @xmath59 is either the raw or smoothed temperature .",
    "we indicate @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the timescale of a nuclear reaction , when we calculate the timescale with the raw and smoothed temperatures , respectively . we replace the subscripts `` nuc '' in equation  ( [ eq : tta ] ) with `` @xmath62 '' for the triple - alpha reaction , and `` cc '' for the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction .",
    "we calculate an energy generation rate by the triple - alpha reaction in the same way as @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65  [ erg  g@xmath66  s@xmath66 ] , @xmath68 is the weak electron screening factor @xcite , @xmath69 is the mass fraction of helium , and @xmath70 , which is the same choice as @xcite .",
    "we also define an energy generation rate by @xmath63c + @xmath63c as @xmath71 where @xmath72 [ erg  mol@xmath66 ] , @xmath73 is a screening factor @xcite , @xmath74 [ s@xmath66  @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77k ) , and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we calculate carbon abundance as @xmath79 [ g@xmath66 ] , where @xmath80 is the number density of carbon , and @xmath81 is avogadro constant .",
    "we define the local dynamical timescale as @xmath82 which is the same choice as that of @xcite .",
    "we introduce a shock detector of a particle in order to search for shock - heated regions .",
    "the shock detector is defined as @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is balsara switch ( see appendix  [ sec : viscosity ] ) .",
    "this indicates how strongly a fluid element is compressed .",
    "the element is compressed when @xmath85 , and is extended when @xmath86 .",
    "the critical value between shocked and unshocked regions is about unity , but is not severe .",
    "although it is just an indicator , it should be useful to grasp where fluid elements are compressed by shock waves .",
    "we present the definition of merger ejecta as follows .",
    "we consider a specific orbital energy of a particle at the time @xmath87 as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are a specific potential energy and velocity of the particle at the time @xmath87 .",
    "if a particle has @xmath91 , it is unbound at the time @xmath87 . a particle which keeps @xmath92 during @xmath93",
    "is defined as a merger ejecta at the time @xmath87 .",
    "this means that a particle unbound temporarily is not counted as a merger ejecta .",
    "we also show the definition of a terminal velocity of a merger ejecta : @xmath94 we can interpret the terminal velocity as a velocity of a particle at infinity .",
    "we set up an initial condition in our sph simulations in three steps .",
    "our setup method is the same as that of @xcite , unless otherwise noted . in the first step ,",
    "we generate two single co  wds individually . in the second step , we choose particles from each of the single co  wds , and assume that these particles consist of pure helium .",
    "in the third step , we combine the two co  wds in the same frame , and form binary co  wds .",
    "we explain these steps in detail in the following .",
    "we can divide the first step into five substeps . in the first step ,",
    "we make 1-dimensional density profile of a fully - degenerate co  wd with uniform temperature of @xmath95  k. in the second substep , we map particles in such a way that their mass densities and specific internal energies are consistent with the single co  wd . in the third substep , we relax these particles as follows .",
    "we evolve these particles for @xmath96  s in the simulation time by means of sph simulation which is different from that described in section  [ sec : sph ] in two points .",
    "one is that a specific internal energy of each particle is fixed . in other words",
    ", we do not solve equation  ( [ eq : eou ] ) .",
    "the other is that each particle receives a damping force against its motion .",
    "the damping force on @xmath21-particle is added to the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) , and given by @xmath97 where we set @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "we adopt @xmath100 experientially .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath101 does not have the impact on the structure of the co  wd .",
    "the structure of the co  wd in the case of @xmath100 is almost the same as that in the case of @xmath102 . in the fourth substep , we relax these particles again by evolving them during @xmath103  s by means of sph simulation described in section  [ sec : sph ] .",
    "the purpose of this substep is to avoid mixing of the helium and carbon - oxygen particles .",
    "this substep has not been done in @xcite . in the fifth substep",
    ", we shift the center of mass in the positions of the sph particles to the origin of coordinates , and the center of mass in the velocities to zero .    in the second step ,",
    "we choose the outermost particles of each of the single co  wds , and assume these particles consist of pure helium .",
    "we call these particles ` helium particles ' .",
    "we define a helium fraction , @xmath104 , as the ratio of helium mass to co mass in these particles .",
    "we note that the eos of these helium particles is _ not _ helium one , but carbon - oxygen one , but it would not introduce a large error for our purposes .",
    "we compare the radius of a pure co  wd with that of a co  wd with helium ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 ) by performing 1-dimensional hydrostatic calculation , and find that the difference among their radii is at most @xmath9 percent .",
    "proactively , we show that the helium particles are not mixed carbon - oxygen ones without merging .",
    "figure  [ fig : init_helium ] indicates the distribution of the helium and carbon - oxygen particles . particularly , as seen in the companion",
    "wd which does not accrete materials , the helium particles keep staying on the surface of the companion wd .",
    "we can divide the third step into two substeps . in the first substep , we put two single co  wds in the same frame .",
    "hereafter , we call the more massive co  wd ` the primary ' , and the less massive one ` the companion ' . we set a separation between the primary and companion , such that the companion s roche - lobe radius is @xmath108 times larger than the companion s radius .",
    "we estimate the roche - lobe radius from an approximate formula of @xcite .",
    "we can express the separation between the primary and companion , @xmath109 , as @xmath110^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the companion s radius , and @xmath112 is the ratio of the companion s mass ( @xmath113 ) to the primary s mass ( @xmath114 .",
    "we set @xmath115 in this study .",
    "hereafter , we define the separation between the primary and companion as the distance between their centers of mass .",
    "they are on an circular orbit around the origin of coordinates .",
    "in the second substep , we relax the configuration of particles composing the binary co  wds , and simultaneously decay the orbit of the binary . for the relaxation",
    ", we again introduce the damping force given by equation  ( [ eq : damp ] ) .",
    "we decay their orbit at every @xmath116 seconds .",
    "the extent of the decay is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the binary separation before the decay .",
    "we can write @xmath119 as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the overall mass density of the companion before this relaxation and orbital decay , and written as @xmath122 .",
    "we adopt @xmath123  s and @xmath124 . in this relaxation and orbital decay ,",
    "we take a co - rotating frame of reference .",
    "therefore , we add centrifugal and coriolis terms to equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) , expressed as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the angular velocity vector , and @xmath127^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we stop this process , @xmath128 after their separation is decreased to less than a critical separation @xmath129 .",
    "this is different from the setup method of @xcite , who stop this process when any particle exceeds the roche lobe .    in figure",
    "[ fig : init_carbonoxygen ] , black dots show the potential energies of particles in the frame corotating with the binary .",
    "this figure corresponds to figure  3 of @xcite .",
    "the blue curves ( @xmath130 ) indicate the potential energies of the field , where the primary and companion are approximated to be point mass at their center of mass .",
    "the potential energies are expressed as @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the position of the center of mass of the primary and companion , respectively .",

    "the potential energies are expressed as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the potential energies among particles .",
    "the binary is tidally locked .",
    "we simulate mergers of two types of binary co  wds : pairs of @xmath137 and @xmath138 co  wds , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 co  wds .",
    "the latter is used for a benchmark , since such a pair of co  wds has been widely investigated in various studies , such as @xcite .",
    "we perform the simulations for binary co  wds with masses of @xmath137 and @xmath138 as follows .",
    "we set a separation between the primary and companion , such that @xmath139  cm .",
    "we choose the helium fraction as @xmath140 , and @xmath141 for both the primary and companion .",
    "we adopt various mass resolutions , where the numbers of sph particles used to resolve @xmath142 are @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 ) .",
    "the total numbers of particles in each model are therefore about @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "we name these models ` model @xmath152 m ' ( @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ) after the total number of particles used in each run .",
    "we follow the evolutions of binary co  wds for @xmath155  s of the simulation time , except for model @xmath154 m . in all the models , they merge after the binary components orbit around each other several times . in all models but for model @xmath154 m , the simulation is followed until the merger remnants reach a dynamically steady state .",
    "we stop the simulation of @xmath154 m just after their merger , since the simulation time is quite long .    for binary co  wds with masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we separate the primary and companion by @xmath156  cm .",
    "the number of sph particles to resolve @xmath142 is @xmath143 ; the total number of particles is about @xmath157 . we evolve it for @xmath158  s. at that time , it reaches a dynamically steady state .",
    "we use a code called otoo @xcite , which stands for ` octree on opencl ' . the otoo code ( hereafter , otoo )",
    "supports a variety of astronomical particle simulations , such as @xmath159-body and sph simulations .",

    "the binaries rotate around each other at least @xmath185 times before the dynamical merger , since their periods are about @xmath186  s. it is difficult to avoid such different merger times for different resolutions , since the mass transfer from the companion to the primary is quite unstable and chaotic .",
    "the separation oscillates with the periods of the binaries from the initial time to the merger time .",
    "this is due to non - zero eccentricities of the orbits of these binaries .    in our simulation ,",
    "the merger time is relatively smaller than previous studies , such as those of @xcite",
    ". this may be because we stop the relaxation process of the binary when the binary separation becomes smaller than a critical separation .",
    "we may make the binary separation too small . in section  [ sec :",
    "verification ] , we discuss this effect on whether the thermonuclear explosion becomes successful or not .    we follow the time evolution of the inner mass distribution ( @xmath187 90 percent lagrangian radii ) of model @xmath150 m as an example .",
    "this is instructive , since the mass distribution in other models is similar to that in model @xmath150 m , except their merger times . in model @xmath150 m , the @xmath8 and @xmath30 percent lagrangian radii",
    "are not changed throughout the simulation .",
    "these radii represent the primary s material .",
    "this means that the merger has little effect on the mass distribution of the primary . on the other hand , the @xmath168 ",
    "@xmath172 percent lagrangian radii are drastically decreased around the merger time ( @xmath188  s ) .",
    "these radii contain the companion s mass .",
    "this means that most of the companion s mass is accreted to the primary at once at the merger time . during about @xmath30",
    "s after the merger time , the mass distribution of the accreted material is still changing . during this time , the @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 percent lagrangian radii decrease gradually , whereas the @xmath103 , and @xmath172 percent lagrangian radii expand rapidly .",
    "after this time , the materials below the @xmath170 percent lagrangian radii keep constant in their radii , while the materials outer than this in the mass coordinate expand slowly .",
    "we conclude that the mass distribution , in particular the interior of the ` merger remnant ' , is dynamically steady at the end of our simulation ( @xmath189  s ) .    below , the evolution of the outer mass distribution , above than @xmath172 percent lagrangian radii .",
    ", is explained for model @xmath150 m . the @xmath175 and @xmath176 percent lagrangian radii rapidly increase well in advance of the merger time .",
    "similarly , the @xmath173 and @xmath174 percent lagrangian radii rapidly increase around the merger time .",
    "the evolution of these lagrangian radii means that a substantial amount of materials is ejected before / at the merging process , which surround the binary system .",
    "this matter can / should affect observations of outcome of the merger , e.g. , an explosion , as discussed in detail in section  [ sec : verification ] .",
    "the highest raw temperature is achieved for @xmath96  s following the merger time in each model .",
    "hereafter , this peak of temperature is called ` first peak ' .",
    "the temperature at the first peak is @xmath190  k , @xmath191  k , @xmath192  k , and @xmath193  k for models @xmath148 m , @xmath149 m , @xmath150 m , and @xmath154 m , respectively .",
    "this temperature seems to converge to @xmath193  k toward the higher resolution .",
    "the smoothed temperature also reaches a high value around the first peak .",
    "in fact , the smoothed temperature at the first peak is the highest among the values obtained for the whole evolution of the system , in each of models @xmath149 m , @xmath150 m , and @xmath154 m .",
    "it is @xmath194  k , @xmath195  k , and @xmath196  k for models @xmath149 m , @xmath150 m , and @xmath154 m , respectively .",
    "this temperature however does not converge even with the highest resolution among our runs .",
    "moreover , this smoothed temperature is much lower than the raw temperature at the first peak .",
    "if the mass resolution becomes extremely high , the smoothed temperature at the first peak may converge , and may become consistent with the raw temperature at the first peak .",
    "we do not discuss the convergence of the smoothed temperature anymore in this paper , but we keep in mind that we may underestimate temperature when we adopt the smoothed temperature .",
    "both of the raw and smoothed temperatures in each model have another peak about @xmath96  s after the first peak .",
    "hereafter , this peak is called the ` second peak ' .",
    "this peak is achieved for materials in the range of density @xmath197 ",
    "@xmath198  @xmath199 in all the models . at the second peak",
    ", model @xmath148 m achieves the highest smoothed temperature .",
    "the raw and smoothed temperature at the second peak converge to @xmath200  k and @xmath201  k , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : maximum_temperature ] summarizes the properties of the first and second peaks .",
    "the first peaks of the raw and smoothed temperatures are not coincident . since the time lag between the first peaks is at most @xmath185  s ,",
    "being sufficiently smaller than the orbital time ( @xmath186  s ) , these peaks appear at the same merging phases .",
    "this is true for the second peaks of the raw and smoothed temperatures , except for model @xmath154 m .",
    "however , in model @xmath154 m , the smoothed temperature at the time of the second peak of the raw temperature gets as high as @xmath202  k , comparable to the smoothed temperature at its second peak . accidentally , the former smoothed temperature is slightly smaller than the latter smoothed temperature .",
    ".properties of the first and second peaks : their type of temperature , temperature , density , and time . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we consider whether the helium detonation can trigger the carbon detonation in the core of the primary .",
    "the helium detonation is thought to trigger the carbon detonation in either of two ways . in one way",
    ", the helium detonation hits the core of the primary , and directly ignites the carbon detonation there .",
    "this is called a ` direct drive ' mechanism . in the other way",
    ", the shock wave created by the helium detonation propagates into the core with little or no carbon burning .",
    "if the helium detonation region encloses the core , the shock wave then could converge somewhere in the core , and could become sufficiently strong to initiate the carbon detonation .",
    "this is called a ` converging shock ' mechanism . for the direct drive mechanism ,",
    "a substantial amount of helium is required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is unlikely that this mechanism triggers the carbon detonation in our models , since @xmath203 is small .",
    "we therefore focus on the converging shock mechanism , to assess if our system could lead to an explosion by this mode , i.e. , the helium - ignited violent merger .    for the converging shock mechanism to successfully operate",
    ", a helium layer needs to enclose the core of the primary .",
    "we investigate the distribution of helium at the initiation time of the helium detonation , as shown in figure  [ fig : helium_view ] . in the cases of @xmath204 and @xmath205 ,",
    "the helium particles enclose the core of the primary , regardless of a choice of the raw or smoothed temperature to define the initiation time of the helium detonation .",
    "however , in the cases of @xmath206 , the helium particles are sparse on the orbital plane , again regardless of a choice of the raw or smoothed temperature .",
    "a reason for this sparseness can be explained as follows . the mass accretion from the companion to the primary proceeds in the following way ; the helium particles first fall , and subsequently the carbon - oxygen particles do so .",
    "the carbon - oxygen particles have already started falling onto the surface of the primary at the initiation time of the helium detonation .",
    "these carbon - oxygen particles hitting the surface of the primary on the orbital plane push the helium particles away .",
    "when @xmath203 is smaller , the helium particles are distributed more sparsely on the orbital plane at the initiation time of the helium detonation for two reasons : first , because of the smaller @xmath203 , all the helium particles are more easily pushed away from the orbital plane .",
    "second , as @xmath203 becomes smaller , the initiation time becomes closer to the merger time ( see table  [ tab : helium_time ] ) .",
    "as the initiation time is closer to the merger time , the carbon - oxygen particles are accreted by the primary more violently ( see figure  [ fig : hotspot_ov ] ) , pushing the helium particles away more easily .    from the above ,",
    "we conclude that only in the case of @xmath207 , the helium detonation can potentially succeed in triggering the core carbon detonation , and can lead to an explosion . in @xcite ,",
    "the helium detonation encloses the core of their primary in @xmath208 .",
    "this result is consistent with our results .",
    "as described above , our binary can potentially explode through the helium - ignited violent merger model , if @xmath209 .",
    "hereafter we consider expected observational outcome , focusing on brightness just after the explosion , hereafter called `` early brightness '' . in this phase ,",
    "the optical photons are basically powered by the thermal energy content produced by the shock heating following the sn explosion , in the envelope of the exploding star .",
    "this energy reservoir is sensitive to the structure of the binary , especially to the size of the envelope of the exploding progenitor .",
    "figure  [ fig : debris_sdis_helium ] shows the matter distribution of our binary system at the initiation time of the helium detonation .",
    "it has a tidal - tail structure at @xmath210 and @xmath211  s , and a disk structure at @xmath212 and @xmath213  s. the materials spread out to @xmath214 away from the center of the primary .",
    "the early brightness is also affected by a radius of the companion , through the interaction between the sn ejecta and the companion .",
    "the radius of the companion at the initiation time of the helium detonation is similar to that at the initial time .",
    "then , the companion radius is about @xmath215  cm ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "moreover , the early brightness can be partly powered by radioactive decay of @xmath12ni synthesized by the helium detonation .",
    "we estimate an amount of @xmath12ni as follows .",
    "the helium detonation synthesizes @xmath12ni when the density is higher than a critical density , @xmath217 , after the helium detonation passes . taking into account the shock compression , we assume that the helium particles with @xmath218 at the initiation time of the helium detonation are converted to @xmath12ni . we show the amount of @xmath12ni as estimated in this way , in all the cases in the fourth column of table  [ tab : helium_time ] .",
    "we qualitatively compare the expected early brightness resulting from the helium - ignited violent merger model of our binary with the early brightness of sn  2011fe and sn  2014j , in terms of radii of the primary and companion at the time of the helium ignition , and @xmath12ni mass after the helium detonation .",
    "the expected light curve will be much fainter than the light curve of sn  2014j .",
    "following the analysis of its early brightness @xcite , sn  2014j is suggested to have either a large primary radius ( @xmath5 ) , a larger companion radius ( @xmath219 ) , or a large amount of @xmath12ni mass near the surface ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "all of these are larger than found in the results of our simulation .",
    "another test is provided by sn  2011fe .",
    "the expected early brightness may likely be brighter than the light curve of sn  2011fe ; the progenitor of sn  2011fe is suggested to have a small radius , @xmath221@xcite .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that our ` envelope ' has tidal - tail and disk - like structures , which has not been taken into account in models to connect the size of the progenitor and the early brightness .",
    "this structure should affect the expected early brightness ; the light curve may be fainter than we expect above because of the small opening angle of the envelope from the primary , and may be consistent with that of sn  2011fe .",
    "in order to quantitatively compare the early brightness resulting from our binary with those of sne 2014j and 2011fe , we have to follow the explosion of our binary by means of numerical simulations .",
    "this is our future work .",
    "another test is provided by properties of sn remnants .",
    "@xcite have investigated expected properties of sn ejecta from an exploding co  wd with a helium wd companion . in their model , the separation is @xmath222 , and the helium wd has a radius of @xmath223 .",
    "the resulting sn remnant does not have a spherically symmetric shape , since the ejecta of the sn prevents from moving beyond the helium wd in this direction .",
    "we anticipate that an sn remnant resulting from the explosion of our binary through the helium - ignited violent merger model has a similar shape to that of @xcite .",
    "this is because their and our binaries have similar opening angles of the companion from the primary , i.e. , @xmath224 degree in @xcite and @xmath225 degree in our case .",
    "the sn remnant with a non - spherically symmetric shape is generally not consistent with a large fraction of sn  ia remnants , which tend to be spherically symmetric .",
    "this section is summarized as follows : when @xmath209 , our binary can explode through the helium - ignited violent merger model .",
    "however , the expected explosion has different features from sn  ia in several respects .",
    "the explosion has the early brightness much brighter than that of sn  2011fe , and much fainter than that of sn  2014j .",
    "note that the light curve may be fainter than we expect , and may be consistent with that of sn  2011fe .",
    "in addition , the explosion will lead to an sn remnant with a non - spherically symmetric shape , which is inconsistent with shapes of a large fraction of sn  ia remnants .",
    "we note that it is unclear whether the other mass combinations can explode through this mode , and whether the explosions can be observed as an sn  ia .",
    "if the system survives with no or insufficient energy injection from the helium detonation , there is a chance that the carbon detonation initiated at a hotspot leads to an explosion , i.e. , the carbon - ignited violent merger model .",
    "a successful explosion in this mode depends on whether the hotspot appears in which the nuclear reaction proceeds rapidly to lead to the carbon detonation .",
    "a necessary condition for this mode to lead to a successful explosion is the following : for the carbon detonation to take place , the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction should proceed rapidly to lead to thermonuclear runaway .",
    "therefore , a heating rate by the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction should exceed a cooling rate due to an adiabatic expansion .",
    "in other words , timescale of the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction should be shorter than local dynamical timescale , i.e. @xmath226 .",
    "we call materials which satisfy this condition the hotspots .",
    "we search for hotspots in our simulation at the time when any particle has the density of @xmath227  @xmath199 and the raw temperature of @xmath228  k , and at the time of the first peak ( see section  [ sec : overview ] ) .",
    "the former time is the same as the time of the creation of the hotspots defined by @xcite , which is based on results of @xcite .",
    "we call this time `` pakmor s time '' . in figure",
    "[ fig : hotspot_ccdy ] , we show the densities and temperatures of particles at pakmor s time ( left ) and the time of the first peak ( right ) in model @xmath154 m .",
    "curves in the top and bottom panels indicate contours of @xmath229 .",
    "note that the criterion of @xcite are stronger than even @xmath230 , since it considers the decay of the carbon detonation .",
    "although we use @xmath231 for the criterion of the hotspots below , we also consider whether the hotspots appear if we choose the constraints of @xcite .    at pakmor s time , there are particles satisfying @xmath232 ( the top left panel ) , but none with @xmath233 ( the bottom left panel ) , where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are evaluated using the raw and smoothed temperatures , respectively . on the other hand , at the time of the first peak , @xmath232 ( the top right panel ) and @xmath236 ( the bottom right panel )",
    "therefore , the creation of the hotspots at pakmor s time depends on the numerical treatment of the temperature , while at the time of the first peak the hotspots are created robustly irrespective of the treatment of temperature in an sph simulation .",
    "we note that , if we use the criterion of @xcite for the creation of the hotspots , the hotspots are not created even at the first peak from the point of view of the smoothed temperature .    in our simulation",
    ", the merger time is relatively shorter than previous studies .",
    "however , the time to the merger does not affect the peak temperature throughout the merging process @xcite .",
    "the above discussion whether the hotspots are created is robust .",
    "hereafter we adopt model @xmath150 m to investigate the formation mechanism of these hotspots . in model @xmath150 m , pakmor s time is @xmath237  s as shown in figure  [ fig : hotspot_hstr ] .",
    "black dots indicate the hotspots .",
    "the hotspots are formed as follows .",
    "just before @xmath237  s , the companion is tidally disrupted .",
    "subsequently , a large amount of the disrupted debris is rapidly accreted onto the primary . this can be seen in the top panel .",
    "the center of the primary is located on the red region , and the debris extends in the direction of the top left from the primary in this figure .",
    "the accretion of the debris forms a shocked region at the surface of the primary .",
    "the shocked region can be seen from @xmath238 to @xmath239 in the bottom panel . in this region ,",
    "the materials are compressed , and the resulting high raw temperatures lead to the creation of the hotspots .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively in agreement with the results by @xcite where a system of binary co  wds with masses of @xmath0 and @xmath14 , similar to our case , is considered .",
    "as seen in their figure  1 , their hotspots are generated at the primary s surface at the time just after the companion is tidally disrupted .    in order to investigate the effects of the alpha process",
    ", we draw the positions of the helium particles when @xmath240 .",
    "the reason why we choose @xmath241 is that the binary explodes in the case of @xmath242 before this time through the helium - ignited violent merger mode ( see section  [ sec : double ] ) . as seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : hotspot_hstr ] ,",
    "the helium particles are far away from the hot particles indicated by the black dots",
    ". the alpha process does not affect the carbon - ignited violent merger mode at this time .",
    "next , we investigate the creation of the hotspots at the time of the first peak .",
    "actually , at the time of the first peak in model @xmath150 m , even the particles with the highest temperature does not satisfy the necessary condition to form the hotspots if we adopt the smoothed temperature . despite of the absence of the hotspots in model @xmath150 m ( for the smoothed temperature ) , we adopt this model for further investigation for the following reasons : we unfortunately do not follow the evolution of model @xmath154 m until its merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state , since the simulation of model @xmath154 m is highly time - consuming . as a result",
    ", we can not assess the chandrasekhar model and investigate merger ejecta , using model @xmath154 m . in order to assess all the explosion models with the same simulation model",
    ", we assess the carbon - ignited violent merger model , using model @xmath150 m .",
    "indeed , the particles in model @xmath150 m obtain high smoothed temperatures through the same mechanism as the hotspots found in model @xmath154 m . regarding these particles with the high smoothed temperature as the hotspots ( which should satisfy the condition for the hotspots in the corresponding higher - resolution simulation ) , we investigate the formation mechanism of these particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : hotspot_hsts1_view ] shows the states of particles around at the time of the first peak .",
    "the black dots indicate particles with the smoothed temperature exceeding @xmath201  k at @xmath243  s. the number of these particles is @xmath244 .",
    "we regard these particles at @xmath243  s as the hotspots .",
    "note that these particles are different from those regarded as the hotspots at pakmor s time .    similarly",
    "to pakmor s time ( see figure  [ fig : hotspot_hstr ] ) , we draw the helium particles ( @xmath245 ) on the top right panel of figure  [ fig : hotspot_hsts1_view ] .",
    "the reason why we choose @xmath245 is the same as the case of pakmor s time .",
    "similarly to pakmor s time , the helium particles are far away from the hot particles indicated by the black dots .",
    "therefore , the alpha process does not affect the carbon - ignited violent merger mode at this time .",
    "we follow trajectories of these particles . at @xmath246",
    "s , they are caught between the primary and a tidal tail . a collision between the primary and the tidal tail forms a shocked region .",
    "when the particles pass across the shocked region , their kinetic energies are converted to the internal energies .",
    "after @xmath246  s , these particles orbit around the primary . at @xmath243",
    "s , these particles irrupt into a clump created by a debris of the tidally disrupted companion .",
    "the clump has a high density , @xmath247 , despite that it is separated from the center of the primary by @xmath248  cm .",
    "its surroundings have a lower density , @xmath249 . when the particles irrupt into the clump , they are compressed ( nearly adiabatically ) , and achieve the highest smoothed temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig : hotspot_asym ] shows the creation and evolution of the clump quantitatively .",
    "the horizontal axes in all but the top right panel indicate @xmath250 , which is an angle between a line segment connecting the coordinate origin and a given point , and one connecting the coordinate origin and the initial position of the center of mass of the primary . at @xmath41",
    "s , the densities are almost independent of @xmath250 at density exceeding @xmath251 .",
    "however , it is not the case at @xmath252  s , @xmath25  s , and @xmath253  s , during several tens of seconds after the merger time .",

    "s , the density becomes independent of @xmath250 again , announcing that the clump has disappeared .",
    "@xcite have found a hotspot formed through a spiral mode instability in the accretion disk consisting of the debris of the companion .",
    "such a hotspot and spiral possibly appear in our simulation .",
    "we can see a spiral in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : hotspot_hsts1_view ] .",
    "also , a particle with the highest temperature at the second peak in our simulation are similar to the hotspot in @xcite ; our particle has density of @xmath259  @xmath199 and temperature of @xmath196  k in @xmath150 m ( see table  [ tab : maximum_temperature ] ) , while the hotspot has density of @xmath197  @xmath199 and temperature of @xmath260  k. our particle has slightly smaller temperature than the hotspot , since nuclear reactions are not solved in our simulation .",
    "we do not discuss the hotspot ( or the particle with the highest temperature at the second peak ) anymore .",
    "since we consider only the necessary condition to lead to the initiation of the carbon detonation and do not deal with subsequent evolution following the detonation , it is not clear whether this binary system explodes in the end or not .",
    "also , it is uncertain whether the explosion is initiated at pakmor s time or at the time of the first peak  both are possible but our understanding is currently limited by numerical difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , we investigate what the explosion should look like as we did for the helium - ignited violent merger model , especially considering two situation where the explosion occurs either at pakmor s time or at the time of the first peak .",
    "we again focus on the expected early brightness and @xmath12ni distribution within the hypothesized sn ejecta .",
    "figure  [ fig : debris_sdis_carbon ] shows the material distribution of our binary at pakmor s time and at the time of the first peak .",
    "the materials spread out beyond @xmath261 , and reach up to @xmath262 .",
    "the system has a disk structure , similar to the material just before an explosion in the helium - ignited violent merger model ( see section  [ sec : double ] ) .",
    "however , the disk in this case is more massive and thicker than in the case of the helium - ignited violent merger model .",
    "following the same argument as presented in section  [ sec : double ] but applied to the expected pre - sn structure for the carbon - ignited violent merger model , we expect that this mode results in the early brightness much brighter than that of sn  2011fe , and much fainter than that of sn  2014j .",
    "this is because the envelope has a radius of @xmath262 , which is much larger than that inferred for sn  2011fe ( @xmath263 ) , but much smaller than that for sn  2014j ( @xmath264 ) .",
    "the situation is similar to that for the helium - ignited violent merger model , and again our comparison suffers from the limitation of the spherically symmetric structure assumed in the estimates of the progenitor radii for these sne .",
    "the envelope has disk - like structure ( see figure  [ fig : debris_sdis_carbon ] ) , and this should be taken into account for detailed comparison .",
    "qualitatively , the small opening angle of the envelope from the primary should make the early brightness fainter than we expected above , and the light curve may be consistent with that of sn  2011fe .",
    "this should be quantitatively investigated by means of numerical simulations , similarly to the early brightness resulting from the helium - ignited violent merger model ( see section  [ sec : double ] ) .",
    "next we discuss @xmath12ni distribution synthesized at the hypothesized explosion .",
    "if the explosion is initiated at pakmor s time , its distribution is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , @xmath12ni is expected to be absent in the central region of the sn ejecta in the following reason : since the companion is burned later than the primary , the ashes of the companion are expected to be located at the central region in the sn ejecta . at the same time , the low density there results in little amount of @xmath12ni . on the other hand , if the explosion is initiated at the time of the first peak , @xmath12ni is present at the central region of the explosion in the following reason .",
    "since the companion has been largely disrupted already , the system is more spherically symmetric in this case than at pakmor s time .",
    "the hotspots are created at the surface of the primary , and the explosion is initiated at the off - center region .",
    "this configuration is similar to that in gravitationally confined detonation model @xcite or the off - center delayed - detonation model @xcite , in which a large amount of @xmath12ni is synthesized near the center of the sn ejecta .",
    "the difference of @xmath12ni distribution comes from whether the companion is disrupted or not at the time of the explosion .    from an observational view point ,",
    "a model where the explosion is initiated at the time of the first peak is more favorable , since sn  ia contains @xmath12ni ( or other fe - peak elements ) near the center of the explosion .",
    "however , even in this case , after the explosion the @xmath12ni distribution is expected to evolve to an hourglass - like shape , since @xmath12ni is prevented from moving toward the direction of the orbital plane as blocked by a debris of the companion @xcite .",
    "this is not consistent with the @xmath12ni distribution generally inferred for sn  ia which is a spherically symmetric shape @xcite .",
    "this section is summarized as follows : in the carbon - ignited violent merger model , we confirmed that the hotspots appear .",
    "therefore , an explosion can potentially occur through this mode .",
    "however , it is expected that the resulting early brightness is much brighter than sn  2011fe and much fainter than sn  2014j .",
    "note that the small opening angle of the envelope from the primary should make the light curve fainter than we expect , and that the light curve may be consistent with that of sn  2011fe .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the @xmath12ni distribution does not have a spherically symmetric shape , also being inconsistent with @xmath12ni distribution generally inferred for sn  ia",
    ". the expected observational outcome will apply to any explosions through this mode , since the explosions can potentially occur only from the wd mass combinations similar to one studied in this paper @xcite .",
    "an explosion in the carbon - ignited violent merger model happens around the merger time , while an explosion in the chandrasekhar mass model happens @xmath265 years after the merger time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . between these two epochs ,",
    "an explosion through other models possibly happens , given that the system does not experience the explosion through the helium- and carbon - ignited violent merger models .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have suggested an explosion triggered by magnetohydrodynamical effects in this phase . in this section",
    ", we do not assess whether the explosion happens in such a model as it is beyond what we can discuss based on our pure hydrodynamic simulation , but discuss what the explosion should look like , assuming that the explosion does happen .",
    "the appearance of the explosion will be affected by the nature of merger ejecta .",
    "figure  [ fig : ejecta_sdis ] shows the spatial and velocity distributions of the merger ejecta at @xmath155  s. the merger ejecta spread almost isotropically , except that they are relatively deficient on the orbital plane ( see also figure  [ fig : ejecta_shck ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the covering factor of the merger ejecta around the merger remnant is almost unity .    @xcite",
    "have also studied effects of merger ejecta on observations of a putative sn taking place in this phase / mode . however , they have focused only on the tidal ejecta for the merger of binary co  wds with masses of @xmath266 and @xmath267 . on the other hand ,",
    "our binary model consists of @xmath268 and @xmath269 co  wds . since our binary has more massive components and a mass ratio closer to unity , our binary merges more violently than theirs @xcite .",
    "consequently , our merger ejecta are dominated by the shocked ejecta ( see section  [ sec : overview ] ) . therefore , the expected effects of the merger ejecta on the observational features are partly different from those described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that naid absorption features are potentially observed with a probability of @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath30 percent if the explosion occurs @xmath270  s  @xmath271",
    "yr or @xmath272  yr  @xmath273  yr after the merger time .",
    "the probability corresponds to the covering factor of their merger ejecta .",
    "however , in the case of our binary , the naid absorption features are potentially observed in almost all the cases .",
    "this result is complementary with the discussion in section  3.4 and 3.6 of @xcite .    finally , we point out that , if an explosion does happen at @xmath189  s , the explosion might look like sn  2014j in the early brightness . at @xmath189",
    "s , the envelope of our binary model spreads out beyond @xmath274 , as seen in figure  [ fig : debris_rho ] .",
    "the horizontal axis indicates the spherical radius .      in this section",
    ", we explore a possibility of an explosion in the chandrasekhar mass model , which might take place if the system does not undergo an explosion through the mechanisms investigated by the previous sections .",
    "after the remnant reaches a dynamically steady state , it gradually loses the thermal energy by neutrino cooling , and increases its central density and temperature .",
    "if its central density and temperature exceed critical values as set by the balance between the nuclear reaction timescale and dynamical or convection time scale , the remnant is likely to explode as an sn ia ( ` the chandrasekhar mass model ' ) assuming the central region consists of carbon . on the other hand",
    ", it likely collapses to a neutron star as triggered by the electron capture , if the remnant has become an oxygen - neon - magnesium wd before reaching to this phase .",
    "the presence of carbon in the remnant depends on whether carbon is quiescently burned .",
    "all of carbon in the remnant are burned , if the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reactions proceed faster than the neutrino cooling at the time when the remnant reaches a dynamically steady state @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : chandra_rhot ] shows mass density and temperature of particles at @xmath189  s in model @xmath150 m . at that time , the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state . in many particles ,",
    "the timescale of the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction is shorter than the timescale of the neutrino cooling , where we calculate the neutrino cooling rate using a public code available at f.  x.  timmes website which is based on @xcite .",
    "however , the timescale of @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction is longer than the dynamical timescale",
    ". therefore , the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction does not trigger the carbon detonation , but will convert the merger remnant to an oxygen - neon - magnesium wd on thermal timescale .",
    "we conclude that , after the remnant evolves on thermal timescale , the remnant would not explode in the chandrasekhar mass model , rather collapses to a neutron star .",
    "we should keep in mind that this result may be affected by the short merger time in our simulation . according to @xcite ,",
    "the maximum temperature in the merger remnant becomes high when the binary suddenly merges .",
    "therefore , if the time to the merger is longer , the maximum temperature in the merger remnant may be lower , and the @xmath63c + @xmath63c reaction rate is lower than the neutrino cooling rate .",
    "then , the remnant could explode in the chandrasekhar mass model .",
    "if binary co  wds ( or its merger remnant ) fail to explode in all but the chandrasekhar mass model , the merger ejecta have at least @xmath275  yr of time during which the ejecta expand into the ism .",
    "an expanding shell is formed as the merger ejecta sweep up its surrounding ism , analogous to an sn remnant .",
    "also , the merger remnant still exists during this phase , analogous to a neutron star in a core - collapse sn remnant .",
    "for this situation , we estimate a detectability of the merger remnant and merger shell .",
    "in particular , we focus on the merger shell , estimating its luminosity .    the evolution of a merger shell is divided into three phases .",
    "the first phase is a ` free expansion phase ' , where the amount of ism swept up by the merger ejecta is negligible .",
    "once the shell sweeps up ism mass comparable to the mass of the merger ejecta , the shell is substantially decelerated entering into the ` sedov phase ' .",
    "materials are thermalized behind the shock wave .",
    "because of the high temperature , the shell loses only a negligible fraction of energy through radiation approximately conserving the total energy content .",
    "once the shell is cooled down , a significant amount of energy is lost by radiation , where the momentum is approximately conserved .",
    "this phase is called a ` snowplow phase ' .",
    "a luminosity of the shell is notated by @xmath276 , and given by @xmath277 where @xmath278 is a cooling function , and @xmath279 is the volume of the shell .",
    "the volume @xmath279 can be expressed as @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is a radius of the shock wave in front of the shell , and @xmath282 is the thickness of the shell .",
    "we give the cooling function @xmath278 as follow : @xmath283 where @xmath284 and @xmath285 are the number densities of electrons and hydrogen atoms in the shell , @xmath286 is the temperature in the shell , and @xmath287  erg@xmath288s@xmath66k@xmath289 @xcite .",
    "note that this cooling function takes into account metal emission lines , and is applicable in the range of @xmath290 .",
    "since hydrogen atoms are perfectly ionized after they pass through the shock wave , the number densities @xmath284 and @xmath285 can be expressed as @xmath291 .",
    "we estimate the shell luminosity at the free expansion . at the free expansion phase ,",
    "the radius of the shock wave @xmath292 , and the thickness @xmath293 is constant .",

    "<S> we perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations for merging binary carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) with masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 , until the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state . using these results </S>",
    "<S> , we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclear explosion , and whether the explosion could be observed as a type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate three explosion mechanisms : a helium - ignition following the dynamical merger ( ` helium - ignited violent merger model ' ) , a carbon - ignition ( ` carbon - ignited violent merger model ' ) , and an explosion following the formation of the chandrasekhar mass wd ( ` chandrasekhar mass model ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> an explosion of the helium - ignited violent merger model is possible , while we predict that the resulting sn ejecta are highly asymmetric since its companion star is fully intact at the time of the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the carbon - ignited violent merger model can also lead to an explosion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the envelope of the exploding wd spreads out to @xmath3 ; it is much larger than that inferred for sn  2011fe ( @xmath4 ) while much smaller than that for sn  2014j ( @xmath5 ) . for the particular combination of the wd masses studied in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the chandrasekhar mass model is not successful to lead to an sn  ia explosion . besides these assessments , we investigate the evolution of unbound materials ejected through the merging process ( ` merger ejecta ' ) , assuming a case where the sn  ia explosion is not triggered by the helium- or carbon - ignition during the merger . </S>",
    "<S> the merger ejecta interact with the surrounding interstellar medium , and form a shell . </S>",
    "<S> the shell has a bolometric luminosity of more than @xmath6 lasting for @xmath7  yr . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , milky way should harbor about @xmath8 such shells at any given time . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the shell(s ) therefore can rule out the helium - ignited and carbon - ignited violent merger models as major paths to sn  ia explosions . </S>"
