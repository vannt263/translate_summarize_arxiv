    "the construction and arguments given here show that there always exists a function of the form given by ( [ phidef ] ) which approximates two given distributions with a specified degree of accuracy provided our assumptions ( 1 - 3 ) are satisfied .",
    "for successively higher degrees of accuracy , the method allows construction of a sequence of approximating functions but this sequence may not necessarily converge , say in @xmath16 , to a limiting function .",
    "a modification of our approach or a similar method based not on the sinc function but on some other basis or wavelet series @xcite might be used to approximate the two distributions and converge to a limiting function .",
    "for example , one might attempt to use the hermite polynomials multiplied by the appropriate gaussian function as a basis .",
    "it remains speculative , however , whether our approach can be modified so as to approximate arbitrary pairs of distributions with a basis other than the sinc functions .",
    "further speculation about this potential generalization is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we would like to stress that the main goal of the present work is not to find the best numeric approximation ( though we can always meet an increasing demand in accuracy ) but to establish the existence of an algorithm allowing uniform approximation of the cumulative distributions .",
    "we sketch the derivation of ( [ claim1 ] ) and ( [ claim11 ] ) .",
    "first we write down the fourier transform of @xmath158 : @xmath159 in ( [ ftrans ] ) @xmath160 is a rectangular function : @xmath161 we consider @xmath162 the integral of @xmath163 over the interval @xmath164 $ ] , for each @xmath165 . using expression ( [ ftrans ] ) ,",
    "rescaling the integration variable , and using definition of integer @xmath166 , for this integral we obtain : @xmath167 where @xmath168^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "property ( [ rr ] ) of the rectangular function @xmath160 implies that each @xmath169 term in the integrand is either 0 for the full range of integration or vanishes for all but a subinterval of length 1 .",
    "the latter holds only if @xmath170 and we have : @xmath171 if and only if @xmath172 , for some integer @xmath83 . after interchanging the order of integration and summation , each integral in the sum is 0 due to the factor @xmath173 , unless @xmath174 . on the other hand , if @xmath174 the integral is just @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we can write ( @xmath176 ) : @xmath177 where we recall the definition of @xmath88 : @xmath88 is the set of all @xmath178 for which @xmath179",
    ".    there are @xmath37 terms @xmath180 of the form given in ( [ f trans1 ] ) ; the approximation given by inequality ( [ claim1 ] ) will be proven if we can show that for @xmath181 the following relation holds : @xmath182 either inequality ( [ f trans2 ] ) holds for @xmath183 , and we are done , or there is a smallest @xmath49 violating ( [ f trans2 ] ) , say @xmath184 , such that @xmath185 .",
    "this implies that @xmath186 , where @xmath187 .",
    "indeed , if this were not the case ( i.e. @xmath188 ) , than @xmath189 would have been defined by the algorithm described in section 3 as @xmath184 since @xmath190 and @xmath191 would also have been in @xmath192 .",
    "this would be a contradiction since @xmath193 was supposed to be the largest element of @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , @xmath186 .    by choice of @xmath43 in section 3 , requirement ( [ c4 ] ) : @xmath194 is less or equal @xmath195 and because @xmath10 integrates over the interval @xmath196 $ ] to at least @xmath197 ( assumption 3 ) , we have : @xmath198 since @xmath15 is a probability density function and by assumption 3 and the algorithm described in section 3 : @xmath199 the last inequality above is simply inequality ( [ f trans3 ] ) . by the construction , @xmath200 for every @xmath49 . this fact and ( [ f trans4 ] )",
