    "we show that this approximation in classical electrodynamics provides a direct analogy with the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite for electrons except that the eigenvalue is mapped to the inverse - polarizability of individual nanoparticles . without any pole approximation of the polarizability",
    ", we find that those localized plasmonic modes are topologically protected and the mode frequency is insensitive to the separation distances within a unit cell .",

    "<S> we study the topological edge plasmon modes between two `` diatomic '' chains of identical plasmonic nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> zak phase for longitudinal plasmon modes in each chain is calculated analytically by solutions of macroscopic maxwell s equations for particles in quasi - static dipole approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation provides a direct analogy with the su - schrieffer - heeger model such that the eigenvalue is mapped to the frequency dependent inverse - polarizability of the nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the edge state frequency is found to be the same as the single - particle resonance frequency , which is insensitive to the separation distances within a unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> finally , full electrodynamic simulations with realistic parameters suggest that the edge plasmon mode can be realized through near - field optical spectroscopy . </S>"
