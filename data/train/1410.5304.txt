    "in the past several decades , the covariant density functional theories have achieved great successes in exploring the finite nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "one of the most outstanding schemes is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory with a limited number of free parameters @xcite . because of its covariant formulation of strong scalar and vector fields , the rmf theory is able to self - consistently describe the nuclear spin - orbit effect .",
    "however , important degrees of freedom associated with the @xmath0 and tensor-@xmath1 fields are missing in the limit of hartree approach .",
    "in fact , the dominant part of one - pion exchange process is the nuclear tensor force component @xcite that plays significant roles in nuclear structure @xcite , excitation and decay modes @xcite , and symmetry energy @xcite .    as an important ingredient of nuclear force",
    ", the tensor force , together with the spin - orbit coupling , characterizes the spin dependent feature @xcite .",
    "it was firstly recognized by the discovery of electric quadrupole moment of the deuteron @xcite . from the viewpoint of the meson exchange picture of the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite , the nuclear tensor force",
    "was thought to be originated from the exchange processes of the @xmath0 and tensor-@xmath1 fields , corresponding to the long and short range parts , respectively @xcite . in general ,",
    "the nuclear tensor force is identified by the following form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a rank-2 irreducible tensor well defined in the non - relativistic quantum mechanics , with the momentum transfer @xmath4 . in recent years",
    ", the nuclear tensor force was shown to play an essential role in determining the shell evolution from the stable to exotic nuclear systems , either by the nonrelativistic or relativistic calculations @xcite , although some suspicious remains due to the fact that the particle - vibration couplings were not included @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of the nuclear tensor force also brought substantial impact on understanding the nature of the nuclear excitations and decay modes @xcite .",
    "for the density - dependent behavior of nuclear symmetry energy  the key quantity to understand the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and relevant astrophysical processes @xcite , the tensor effects have also been revealed to be among the physics responsible for the uncertainty of the symmetry energy at supranuclear densities @xcite .",
    "although the nuclear tensor force has been well identified with the form , researchers encounter some difficulties due to the evident model dependence in determining its coupling strength based on the well - developed energy functionals such as the skyrme forces @xcite . within the covariant density functional theory founded on the meson exchange picture of the nuclear force , people attempt to investigate the tensor effects by including the lorentz tensor couplings , e.g. , in terms of @xmath5-tensor couplings @xcite . however , such so - called `` tensor '' is just pure central - type contributions in the limit of hartree approach .",
    "the solution is to introduce explicitly the fock diagrams of the meson - nucleon couplings , so that the degrees of freedom associated with the @xmath0 and tensor-@xmath1 fields can be efficiently taken into account , for instance by the density - dependent relativistic hartree - fock ( ddrhf ) theory @xcite . within ddrhf",
    ", substantial improvements due to the tensor effects have been revealed in reproducing the shell evolution without additional adjusted parameters @xcite .",
    "what is more , the relativistic representation of the nuclear tensor force was proposed very recently , with the new origin associated with the fock diagrams of the isoscalar scalar @xmath6- and vector @xmath5- couplings @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed that the spin - dependent feature  the nature of the nuclear tensor force  can be extracted and quantified almost completely by the proposed relativistic formalism @xcite .    in this work , we will study the effects of the nuclear tensor force components which hide in the fock diagrams of the meson - nucleon couplings , particularly the isoscalar scalar @xmath6- and vector @xmath5-couplings , on the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars .",

    "it is seen that the tensor coupling constants in @xmath108 and @xmath109 channels tend to certain values at high density , whereas due to the exponential density - dependent behavior of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , those from the isovector @xmath1-v , @xmath1-t and @xmath0-pv channels vanish at the supranuclear density region where the tensor effects become notable .      in understanding the cooling mechanism of neutron stars , the proton fraction @xmath115 is a key quantity which carries significant information of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter .",

    "following the triangle inequality for momentum conservation and charge neutrality condition @xcite , it is easy to obtain the threshold of the proton fraction @xmath118 as @xmath119 .    within the density range of static and @xmath120-equilibrium neutron star matter",

    "[ fig : esym ] ( a ) , it can be concluded that the tensor effects on the mass - radius relation of neutron star and on the density dependence of symmetry energy are congruous with each other . due to the fact that the tensor edfs depend on the momentum @xmath100",

    "that is , the presence of the nuclear tensor force leads a neutron star to be more compact . from the lower panel of table [ tab : mr ] , one can also find similar systematical changes due to the nuclear tensor force .",
    "with the relativistic representation of the nuclear tensor forces that originate from the fock diagrams of the meson - nucleon coupling , we studied the self - consistent tensor effects on the saturation mechanism , the equation of state , the density - dependent behavior of the symmetry energy and the neutron star properties . within the density - dependent relativistic hartree - fock ( ddrhf ) theory , two types of the calculations were performed to reveal the tensor effects , i.e. , the ones with the full ddrhf functional and those dropping the tensor terms .",
    "it is found that if removing the tensor force components in the ddrhf functionals the saturation mechanism of nuclear matter is notably influenced . due to the fact that the tensor edfs depend on the momentum essentially , the tensor effects become more and more distinct with the density increasing . due to the naturally involved tensor force components in the fock diagrams , the density - dependent behavior of the symmetry energy",
    "is fairly softened and consequently it leads neutron stars to be more compact . moreover , for the direct urca ( du ) process that cools the neutron star rapidly , the threshold density is raised by the nuclear tensor force .",
