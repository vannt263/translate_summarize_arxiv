    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are among the most luminous sources in the universe , with infrared luminosities of @xmath3 .",

    "both of these alternatives suffer from the same difficulty of requiring the ionizing radiation to penetrate almost 1 kpc through the disk in order to produce the large scale emission observed .",
    "if indeed star formation is occurring on a scale of @xmath59 kpc  as the h@xmath11 emission indicates  then iras  08311@xmath52459  boasts star formation on a significantly larger scale than the 100300 pc typically seen among ulirgs in mid - infrared studies @xcite .",
    "if the narrow , rotating component of the pa@xmath1 line is produced by young stars in a disk , the implied star formation rate ( sfr ) is @xmath60 @xmath61  yr@xmath7 , assuming an intrinsic h@xmath62pa@xmath1 line flux ratio of 8.6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* case b with @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 k ) and a conversion between h@xmath1 luminosity and sfr following @xcite .",
    "this estimate only includes the flux in the narrow gaussian component to the pa@xmath1 line , as portrayed in figure  [ fig : paspect ] .",
    "of course , this conversion takes into account neither the extinction at pa@xmath1 , nor the contribution of the central agn to the narrow pa@xmath1 line flux  both of which may be significant in this system , yet would affect our sfr estimate in opposite senses . unpublished visible light spectra of iras  08311@xmath52459indicate an extinction to the disk of @xmath66 mag , comparing the pa@xmath1 and h@xmath50 emission , leading to 0.16 mag of extinction at pa@xmath1 .",
    "the agn contribution may exceed this value , such that the above sfr estimate likely represents an upper limit .",
    "if the entire far - infrared luminosity in iras  08311@xmath52459  were attributable to star formation , then one may compute the expected total star formation rate by two methods .",
    "the first , from @xcite , puts a lower bound on the bolometric luminosity by assuming that the luminosity is dominated by stars converting protons to he via the cno cycle , and that the rate of mass reduction is the rate at which stars are forming .",
    "this approach yields an expected sfr of @xmath67 @xmath61  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the other method , from @xcite , integrates the total stellar luminosity output to produce an estimated sfr of 650 @xmath61  yr@xmath7 , assuming all of the stellar luminosity is reprocessed into infrared emission ( @xmath68 in their model ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that either there is a large amount of star formation that remains obscured at 2 @xmath21 m , or that the hidden agn is a substantial contributor to the infrared luminosity in this system . given the presence of the unresolved , relatively strong [ emission we favor the latter interpretation , though with an estimated sfr of @xmath2375 @xmath61 yr@xmath7 , star formation could clearly contribute a significant portion of the total luminosity .",
    "integral field spectroscopy of the suspected agn - powered ulirg , iras  08311@xmath52459 , provides important constraints on the nature of the line emitting regions in this galaxy .",
    "the evidence presented can be reasonably explained by the presence of a bona - fide quasar embedded within a disk of star formation in the post - merger system .",
    "both components contribute significantly to the total energy production in the galaxy .",
    "the salient points derived from these data are :    1 .",
    "the low velocity emission of pa@xmath1 , along with h@xmath11 , has been identified with a rotating disk of material with a diameter of @xmath59 kpc .",
    "it is likely that widespread star formation is responsible for the observed narrow line emission from this region .",
    "moderately broad emission is seen in both pa@xmath1 and [ , with a projected fwhm@xmath69 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the broad emission is spatially unresolved ( @xmath51 pc ) in both species .",
    "both lines are spectrally symmetric , and there is no observed spatial offset between the red and blue wings of the broad pa@xmath1 emission .",
    "outflow phenomena are therefore unlikely to account for the high velocity emission , with an agn being the preferred source of the [ and broad pa@xmath1 emission .",
    "we thank michael strauss for his role in the early stages of the caltech effort in studying ulirgs .",
    "the wavelength reference for the [ line was provided by james graham .",
    "we also thank the night assistant at palomar , rick burruss , for assistance in the observations .",
    "is supported by the nasa graduate student researchers program , and the lewis kingsley foundation",
    ". this research is supported by a grant from the national science foundation .",
    "functional line fits have been applied to the extracted nuclear spectra of iras  08311@xmath52459 , and displayed in figures  [ fig : paspect ] and [ fig : h2spect ] . in each case , the continuum is fit with a linear function , and all lines except for pa@xmath1 are fit with a single gaussian profile . attempting to fit pa@xmath1 with a single gaussian resulted in an obviously inadequate fit , but the resulting parameters are useful in fitting weaker atomic lines .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the weaker lines does not justify the use of multiple component fits , yet their underlying profiles are expected to closely resemble pa@xmath1 . the single - fit pa@xmath1 has a central velocity of 30147 km  s@xmath7 and a fwhm of 415 km  s@xmath7 ; accounting for an instrumental resolution of 230 km  s@xmath7 , this translates to an intrinsic line width of 345 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these numbers become the constraints used , where necessary , for the low ionization atomic lines .",
    "the pa@xmath1 spectrum contains three observable emission features , fit with four gaussian profiles  two for pa@xmath1 itself .",
    "it was found to be necessary to fix the line center and width according to the single - gaussian pa@xmath1 values as discussed above , leaving only the flux as a free parameter .",
    "the two components in the pa@xmath1 line fit were unconstrained , and tended to repeatably settle to the same parameters despite factors of two modifications to the initial estimated values .",
    "the h@xmath11  10 s(4 ) line was constrained to share the 380 km  s@xmath7 line width found for the h@xmath11  10 s(3 ) line , as discussed below .",
    "the plot of fit residuals at the bottom of figure  [ fig : paspect ] shows that the two - gaussian fit for pa@xmath1 does a passable job , but excess emission on the blue side well above the noise level demonstrates the approximate nature of the fitting business .",
    "for this reason , the separate components in the pa@xmath1 fit are not to be taken as individual , distinct physical components , but rather as a tool for gaining a qualitative feel for the nature and symmetry of the broad emission .",
    "table  [ tab : fits ] lists the line properties and their fit parameters .",
    "the h@xmath19 [ spectrum contains three lines , each fit with a single gaussian profile .",
    "the fit was performed placing no constraints on the three parameters of each line fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2spect ] shows the result of the combined fit , and table  [ tab : fits ] gives the properties of the individual line fits .",
