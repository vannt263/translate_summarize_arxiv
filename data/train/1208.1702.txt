    "in this paper we introduce the theory of a device that can in principle extract energy from an external magnetic field . the idea for the device came to us from the theoretical analysis of the 1913 wilson & wilson @xcite experiment ( wwe ) described in section 5 . since the correct theoretical explanation of the experiment gave rise to controversies in the literature due to difficulties in properly applying maxwell theory in rotating frames we decided to give a very pedagogical presentation for the problem of expressing maxwell equations in a coordinate invariant way using the theory of differential forms .",
    "then , using that formalism and the correct jumping conditions for the electromagnetic field variables between moving boundaries separating two different media we get in a very clear way the electromagnetic field as measured in the laboratory in the wwe .",
    "we think that our approach clears up immediately what is wrong with some other attempts to find a correct description of the wwe in the sample of papers quoted .",
    "the description of the machine to extract energy from an external magnetic field is given in section 6 where it is observed that the machine once puts in motion makes electromagnetic angular to be stocked in the electric plus magnetic fields in the opposite direction of the mechanical angular mechanical of the device ( when @xmath1 ) and thus due to angular momentum conservation the machine has its mechanical angular momentum increased .",
    "of course , all the conservation laws are in operation in our device and the energy being generated comes from the external electromagnetic field .",
    "the formulation of maxwell equations in intrinsic form requires as preliminary mathematical structures :    \\(i ) a @xmath2-dimensional orientable a global @xmath2-form @xmath3 .",
    "if the manifold is not orientable then it is necessary to use besides the concepts of _ pair _ form fields also the concepts of _ impair _ form fields .",

    "we now propose a way to extract energy from a magnetic field using the results just obtained above . in order to do that we first recall that",
    "when the magnetic insulator in figure 1 which has momentum of inertia @xmath157 is put in rotation with constant angular velocity @xmath396 it acquires an angular momentum@xmath397 for the preliminaries theoretical considerations in this section we suppose that there are no energy losses due to friction of the rotating magnetic insulator with its supporters nor losses due to joule effect on electric wires . as a consequence",
    "the  total angular momentum of the system ( i.e. , the rotating dielectric plus the electromagnetic field ) must be conserved .",
    "we suppose moreover that the system does not dissipate energy through radiation . under these conditions",
    "the total angular momentum of the system is @xmath398 where by @xcite abraham s formula @xmath399 we choose our coordinate system such that the origin lives in the middle of the rotating axis of the dielectric . under these conditions",
    "@xmath400 then@xmath401 thus the integral corresponding to the @xmath402 component vanishes and we have @xmath403 where @xmath404 is the height of the cylindrical dielectric . when @xmath405@xmath406    it is a remarkable fact that @xmath407 points in the opposite direction of @xmath408 if @xmath409 ( as it is the case in the wilson & wilson experiment according to @xcite .",
    "since the total angular momentum of our system must be conserved we see that @xmath410 must increase if there is no energy losses due to friction and joule effect in the wires and we could use the potential @xmath389 given by eq.([v ] ) to power an electric machine .",
    "of course the energy powering the electric machine can only be coming from the energy _",
    "stocked _ in the external magnetic  field .",
    "it will work while the external magnetic field is presented . of course extracting energy from the magnetic field",
    "will make the value of @xmath411 to decrease and with this decrease the potential @xmath389 will also decrease and at the end the machine will stop working .    if @xmath412 the electromagnetic angular momentum is in the same direction of the mechanical angular momentum , which must start to decrease after the device is put in rotation .",
    "then , the electric field will decrease also making the electromagnetic momentum to decrease whereas the mechanical angular momentum must then start to increase again .",
    "it is not clear at this moment if the system will oscillate between a minimum and maximal mechanical angular momentum or will stabilize .    * * real world machine**__. _ _ in the real world where friction and joule effect are always present in order to extract energy from the magnetic field we need a machine like the one in figure 2 where the potential difference @xmath389 given by _",
    "eq.([v ] ) _ is used first ,  if necessary , to power  in a compensator motor just enough to restore eventual losses due to friction and joule effect on the electric wires , and secondly @xmath389 is also used to power a motor to generate useful work .",
    "in this paper we recalled how to correctly solve maxwell equations in order to find the electric field in the famous wilson & wilson experiment using the theory of differential forms with permits an intrinsic formulation of the problem .",
    "we present also the correct jump conditions for the @xmath39 and @xmath87 fields in an invariant way  when the boundary separating two media is in motion .",
    "we give enough details for the paper to be useful for students and researchers .",
    "moreover we use the theoretical results to present a surprising result which for the best of our knowledge is new : _ a machine that can extract energy from an external magnetic field_. under appropriate conditions ( @xmath409 ) the machine once puts in motion will start increasing the electromagnetic angular momentum stocked in the electromagnetic field in the direction contrary to the original mechanical angular momentum of the device which thus will start increasing ( theoretically ) its angular speed until @xmath413 , thus generating a big potential even in a small external magnetic field which can be use to produce useful work .",
    "of course , a machine like this one if in orbit around a neutron star can produce a lot of energy in a simple way than the hypothetical machine described , e.g. , in page 908 @xcite projected to extract energy from black holes by throwing garbage on it",
