    "stars of low and intermediate mass evolve through the planetary nebula phase . by the ejection of their outer layers the planetary nebulae ( pne )",
    "contribute to the enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "spectroscopic studies of pne are essential to better understand and quantify this enrichment . until the launch of the spitzer space telescope it was impossible to fully study pne in the infrared outside the galaxy s chemical environment because of the faintness of extragalactic targets .",
    "reaching targets in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) is particularly appealing because they have known distances and arise in a lower metallicity environment than galactic targets .",
    "since the distance is known the enrichment of expelled nebular material can be combined with accurate knowledge of the central star s luminosity .    in this letter ,",
    "the infrared spectrum of the lmc planetary nebula smp83 , taken with the irs spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope , is presented .",
    "the nature of the central star of smp83 is not yet well known and has been the subject of several studies .",
    "@xcite , using hst imagery , conclude that smp83 is a type  i pn with a very massive progenitor star of 6  , close to the progenitor mass limit for a pn .",
    "@xcite reported the sudden development of wolf - rayet ( wr ) features in the line at @xmath14686 in the nebula . during 1993 and 1994",
    "the central star experienced an increase in luminosity which was studied by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "the latter showed that the chemical composition of the atmosphere is that of incompletely processed cno material .",
    "they suggest several scenarios for the nature of the central star , including a low or high  mass single star or a low or high  mass binary system .",
    "@xcite conclude that binary systems present the fewest contradictions when explaining all the central star peculiarities .",
    "@xcite indicated that the fast variations of the stellar parameters are similar to those expected in the initial phase of the _ born  again _ scenario in which stars undergo a final helium flash .",
    "@xcite presented optical spectroscopy for 30  pne in the lmc including smp83 .",
    "they found that the densities obtained with the lines were slightly lower than those derived with the lines . @xcite",
    "made spectroscopic observations of several galactic and lmc pne , including smp83 . using collisionally excited lines they derived densities , temperatures and ionic abundances for the objects in their sample .",
    "@xcite and @xcite combined optical and ultraviolet ( iue ) data with ionization models to derive the composition of the nebula .",
    "they found that the c and o abundances were under ",

    "the infrared region of the spectrum is very useful for several reasons .",
    "the lines seen in the infrared are not sensitive to the temperature , making them reliable indicators of the chemical composition of the nebulae .",
    "the peak of dust emission occurs in the infrared and features such as pahs and silicates ( when present ) can only be studied in this part of the spectrum .",
    "the observations were made with the irs spectrograph @xcite on board the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained during the in - orbit checkout phase of the satellite , on 2003  nov  9 ( observation number 7857664 ) .",
    "the diameter of the nebula is @xmath2 and therefore can be calibrated as a point source .",
    "the observations at smp83 consisted of spectra from short  high ( sh ) , long - high ( lh ) , and the first order of short  low ( sl1 ) modules . the wavelength coverage for each module is ; sl1 ( from 7.514.2  ) , sh ( from 1019.5  ) , lh ( from 19.337  ) .",
    "the high  resolution modules provide a spectral resolution of @xmath3600 and the low  resolution @xmath390 .",
    "the `` staring '' observation mode was used , with two nod positions for each module .",
    "the observation times were 180 , 240 and 480 seconds for sl1 , sh and lh respectively .",
    "these total integration times represent the co  addition of shorter individual ramps .",
    "the data were processed through a copy of the spitzer science center s pipeline reduction software ( version s9.1 ) maintained at cornell . from that point",
    "the reduction and extraction techniques were carried out as follows : the mean of the flux estimates from each ramp cycle were combined .",
    "the two nod positions in sl1 were subtracted to eliminate the contribution from the background .",
    "the resulting images were extracted using the cornell - developed software package smart @xcite .",
    "the high  resolution spectra were calibrated by dividing the extracted spectrum of the source by the spectrum of the standard star hr6348 ( observation number 7834624 ) and multiplying by its template @xcite .",
    "remaining spikes were removed manually .",
    "the resulting spectra in sh and lh at the second nod position are shown in figure  [ spec_f ] .",

    "these are presented in the last column of table  [ fluxabun_t ] . in order to derive the ionic abundances with respect to hydrogen ,",
    "we have made use of the observed h@xmath6 flux given by @xcite ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that @xcite and @xcite give a much different observed value ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is unclear why these authors quote such different values . @xcite and @xcite derived the h@xmath6 flux using a filter centered on the line",
    ". it may be that they are also measuring part of the stellar flux .",
    "@xcite measured the nebular h@xmath6 flux in three different epochs and obtain very similar values ( the differences are only due to the smaller slit apertures used ) . the larger aperture used by @xcite is big enough to contain the nebula .",
    "because of the consistency between the three values they quote and the fact that they separate the contribution from the star and the nebula , we have opted to use that of @xcite .",
    "the derived  in the previous section involves the combination of infrared and optical lines ( where the latter are given relative to h@xmath6=100 ) and the good agreement seen for all the values supports the choice of the h@xmath6 flux made in this letter .",
    "we note however that using the h@xmath6 flux from @xcite or @xcite will bring the ionic abundances derived from the infrared lines down by a factor @xmath32 .",

    "almost all important stages of ionization in neon ( except ) and sulfur ( except ) have been measured . to account for the unobserved stages of ionization the optical lines at @xmath14729 and @xmath14728 ( for ) by @xcite and at @xmath16717 and @xmath16731 ( for ) by @xcite have been used . by adding the abundances of different stages of ionization ,",
    "the total abundances of neon and sulfur are found to be 8.6@xmath9 and 4.8@xmath10 respectively .",
    "most of the absolute error in these abundances comes from the uncertainty in the fluxes @xcite and therefore the uncertainties in the abundances are @xmath335% .",
    "it is interesting to compare the neon and sulfur abundances to average lmc abundances of hii regions , [ s / h]=5.2@xmath10 and [ ne / h]=5.4@xmath9 @xcite . @xcite",
    "noticed with this comparison that the sulfur and neon abundances they derived where systematically lower than those of the lmc regions they compared to . in this paper",
    "the sulfur abundance in smp83 agrees with that of the lmc .",
    "this is important because @xcite pointed out that the sulfur abundance of the galactic pne that they studied was lower than solar .",
    "they suggested that either the solar sulfur abundance was overestimated or that sulfur could be destroyed in the course of evolution , contrary to evolutionary modeling . since the sulfur abundance derived in this paper is consistent with that of the lmc , there is support for the hypothesis of an overestimated solar sulfur abundance . it would be interesting to derive the sulfur abundance for more lmc pne to confirm this .",
    "the neon abundance found here is higher than in previous studies @xcite . a small part of the difference comes from the ionic abundances of and whose contributions were neglected in previous studies since it was not observed .",
    "nonetheless , the infrared data show that its contribution to the total neon abundance is important .",
    "the larger difference however comes from the contribution from . in this letter",
    "this contribution is found to be 2 times higher than that derived by @xcite and @xcite who used the optical lines at 3868 and 3967   .",
    "this difference is similar to what has been seen in other nebulae ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem depends on the adopted .",
    "the  obtained when using the ratio of the 15.55  and 3869    lines is 12000 k. there are several galactic nebulae for which these lines give a much lower temperature than that of the lines ( i.e. , ngc6302 , ngc6537 , ngc7027 ) . if a higher temperature is used the ionic abundances derived from the optical lines decrease .",
    "however the low ",
    "level infrared lines are not affected by this problem since they hardly depend on the temperature and give better estimates of the ionic abundance . the neon abundance seems larger than that in the lmc , although this is arguable considering the errors . if real , this enrichment must have taken place likely via @xmath11-captures starting from @xmath12n during dredge - up .",
    "this mechanism marginalizes the @xmath13 reactions expected to occur during thermal pulses , and extinguishes the he - burning shell .",
    "this could explain the lack of carbon at the surface of smp83 @xcite .",
    "a confirmation of the neon enrichment could lead to important constraints in the nature of the progenitor star of smp83 . in massive stars ( @xmath14 ) , which are convectively unstable",
    ", the ne production occurs through the chain reaction @xmath15 and the observed abundances will depend on whether further @xmath11 capture through @xmath16 has occurred , and on core enrichment from the surface by rotational mixing @xcite .",
    "neon enhancement in the massive stars thus coincides with carbon and oxygen enhancements and hydrogen depletion in the core .",
    "this leads spectroscopically at the surface to wc - type wolf - rayet stars , according to the evolutionary models and observational tests of massive stars in early and later post - main sequence stages @xcite .",
    "thus , if the neon enrichment is confirmed , the abundance pattern in the nebula and at the surface of smp83 most likely excludes the central star as a population i wolf - rayet star , as one of the scenarios proposed by @xcite , and is more consistent with an alternate hypothesis of an intermediate mass star that has experienced efficient dredge - up in the post - agb phase .",
    "mid infrared spectra of lmc planetary nebula smp83 have been presented for the first time using the irs spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope .",
    "the spectrum of smp83 shows high excitation lines and no signs of dust or a continuum associated with the nebula .",
    "the emission lines have been used with optical spectra from the literature to derive the electron temperature for several ions in the nebula .",
    "there is a correlation of the electron temperature with ionization potential .",
    "the abundances for several ions have been derived .",
    "the total neon abundance , with additional contributions from states seen only in the infrared , is higher than the optically - determined abundance , which is more sensitive to the temperature .",
    "the neon abundance seems larger than the adopted average neon lmc abundance .",
    "this could suggests that some neon enrichment must have taken place in the course of evolution .",
    "if the neon enrichment is confirmed , this could favor the scenario of smp83 having evolved from an intermediate mass star instead of a massive wolf ",
    "rayet star as some studies have suggested .",
    "the sulfur abundance agrees with that of the lmc .",
    "this might indicate that the problem of the low sulfur abundance found in galactic pne relative to solar comes from an overestimation of the latter , but this should be confirmed with more studies on the sulfur abundance in pne in the lmc .",
