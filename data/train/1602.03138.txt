    "<S> mott insulators can be portrayed as  unsuccessful metals \" : systems in which a strong coulomb repulsion prevents charge conduction notwithstanding the metal - like density of conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to unlock such large density of frozen carriers with an electric field offers a tantalizing opportunity to realize new mott - based microelectronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> here we explicitly unveil how such unlocking happens by solving a simple , yet generic , model for correlated insulators using dynamical mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that the electric breakdown of a mott insulator can occur via a first - order insulator - to - metal transition , characterized by an abrupt gap - collapse in sharp contrast to the zener tunneling mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the switch - on of charge conduction is due to the energetic stabilization of a metallic phase that preexists as metastable state in equilibrium and is disconnected from the stable insulator . </S>",
    "<S> our findings rationalize recent experimental observations and offer a guideline for future technological research .    </S>",
    "<S> the conventional description of electric breakdown , i.e. the field driven formation of a conductive state in an otherwise insulating system , is based on the well - known landau - zener mechanism of quantum tunnelling across the insulating gap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of the collective nature of their gap , mott insulators recently emerged as ideal candidates to replace semiconductors  @xcite , whose gap is , on the contrary , fixed by their chemistry and lattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments in several mott insulators  @xcite have reported a whole novel scenario for the electric breakdown , including for instance anomalously small threshold fields , which can not be reconciled with the smooth carrier activation predicted by quantum tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> these findings rather suggest a genuine field - induced insulator - to - metal mott transition , which can be phenomenologically described  @xcite through the competition between a stable insulating phase and a metastable metallic one . </S>",
    "<S> however , theoretical studies within the single - band hubbard model , the paradigm of strongly correlated systems , have only shown a breakdown due to tunnelling across the mott gap , as if the latter was as rigid as the band gap in semiconductors  @xcite , in disagreement with the experimental observations .    here </S>",
    "<S> we reveal a novel mechanism for the electric breakdown , which is compatible with the above experimental evidences and can be realized as soon as extra degrees of freedom commonly active in real materials are taken into account  @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we disclose this scenario in the non - perturbative solution of a simple two - orbital model for mott insulators , which it is found to undergo a discontinuous transition from an insulator to a gap - collapsed metal at threshold fields much smaller than those expected in a zener breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon arises on the insulating side of the first - order equilibrium mott transition where the stable insulator coexists with a metastable metal , and it is evidently the more pronounced the greater the difference in physical properties of the two coexisting phases . </S>",
    "<S> we argue the latter is the actual crux for this phenomenon to be observable , as it entails wider coexistence regions and stronger metastability .        </S>",
    "<S> our model features two orbitals lifted by a crystal - field splitting @xmath0 that are broadened by intra- and inter - orbital hopping into two bands of equal width . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons interact via a local coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the density is set to two electrons per site ( half - filling ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy unit is such that the intra - orbital hopping is @xmath1 . we solve the model by means of dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite ( see supplementary informations ) .    at equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> the model undergoes a first - order mott transition for a critical value of @xmath2 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) . for the sake of definiteness , in the following we shall fix @xmath3 , for which @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath5 the insulating solution is stable , but the metal continues to exist as a metastable solution up to the spinodal point @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the state variable that better characterizes the transition is the orbital polarization @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath8 , the model describes a partially polarized metal ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a finite interaction @xmath10 induces a repulsion between occupied and unoccupied states , leading to an effective crystal field larger than the bare value @xmath11 , i.e. increasing @xmath12 . at the first - order transition </S>",
    "<S> the metal turns abruptly into a fully polarized ( @xmath13 ) insulator  @xcite , with a finite gap separating the two bands  @xcite : a sort of mott insulator `` disguised '' as a conventional band insulator  .    in order to study the effect of an applied electric field we consider a layered slab of our idealized material subject to a static and uniform electric field @xmath14 ( coulomb gauge ) directed along the slab direction ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) .    starting from the equilibrium insulator at @xmath15 we increase the electric field @xmath16 until a _ conducting _ </S>",
    "<S> state is established at a threshold value @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this field - induced conducting state has strikingly different properties depending on the distance of the zero - field system from the first - order mott transition point , see fig.[fig1](c)-(d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> deep in the mott insulating region ( @xmath18 ) we observe the gradual formation of a conducting path through the slab . </S>",
    "<S> this is the result of the progressive bending of the gapped spectral density eventually leading to the formation of two metal regions at the two ends of the slab . </S>",
    "<S> as the field grows , the two regions extend towards the center until they touch and a conductive path through the sample is established . during such evolution the insulating gap </S>",
    "<S> is rigidly preserved and the conduction happens because the field leads to a sizeable hole- and electron - doping on the two sides . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is not dissimilar from the landau - zener mechanism in band insulators , as already discussed for correlated systems in different contexts  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely novel scenario is encountered when the system is perturbed near the equilibrium mott transition ( @xmath19 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a sharp insulator - to - metal transition occurs at the threshold field @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the sudden change of the layer - resolved spectral density across the resistive transition reported in panel ( d ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . as the @xmath17 value is crossed </S>",
    "<S> the gap abruptly collapses : a metallic state characterized by a sizeable spectral weight at the fermi level suddenly appears without any precursor on the insulating side .    </S>",
    "<S> these qualitative differences reflect on the quantitative aspects of the transition . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c)-(d ) it is possible to observe that the field strength needed to induce a conductive channel through the slab is much smaller for the sharp resistive transition with respect to the tunnel breakdown case . </S>",
    "<S> this is readily appreciated in panel ( e ) , showing the threshold field @xmath20 in units of the zero - field insulating gap @xmath21 as a function of the distance from the _ equilibrium _ mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> a clear break is observed in the curve around @xmath22 separating the two breakdown regimes . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the strong variations of @xmath17 are independent on the gap value , which weakly varies in the whole region .     of the metallic ( blue circles and line ) and the insulating ( red diamonds and line ) solutions , as a function of the electric field @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the filled / open symbols mark the stable / metastable character of the solution for each value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) hysteresis loop for the orbital polarization @xmath7 across the zero - bias mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> the red and blue arrows define the directions of continuous evolution for the insulating and metallic phases respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the big green arrow indicates the electric - field induced switch between the stable insulator and the metastable metal . </S>",
    "<S> _ inset _ : effective crystal field @xmath24 in units of the bandwidth @xmath25 as a function of the correlation strength @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic state is destabilized for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) polarization profile for the metastable metal for increasing electric field strength ( grey arrow ) . </S>",
    "<S> red diamonds / blue circles refer to a system with an insulating / metallic ground state . ]    our findings for the resistive transition are directly related to the competition between the two phases that characterize the equilibrium metal - insulator transition , as we explicitly show below . at @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> the insulating solution has a lower internal energy and is separated from the metastable metal by a small energy difference @xmath28 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the metallic solution is more charge - polarizable hence it rapidly gains energy as @xmath16 is increased , whereas the energy of the incompressible mott insulator remains constant . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the two energy curves eventually cross at the threshold field @xmath17 and the metallic phase becomes stable . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) we report the equilibrium orbital polarization of the two phases near the mott transition point . an hysteresis loop is realized as a function of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the two solutions , characterized by different values of @xmath12 for any value of the model parameters , are not adiabatically connected across the mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the applied field can transform the stable insulator into the metastable metal  @xcite only through a genuine first - order transition , as highlighted by the sudden collapse of the insulating gap reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) we show that , as long as the system is able to sustain a metallic solution with partial orbital polarization , @xmath29 , the field drives the resistive switch reducing the orbital charge imbalance of the metastable metal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the net effect of the electric field is essentially to move in the phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) as if @xmath10 or better the crystal field @xmath0 were reduced by the field . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> when correlations destabilize any partially polarized metal ( @xmath30 ) the field can only continuously modify the insulating state leading to the formation of the tunnel conducting paths observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) .    besides unveiling the above unconventional breakdown mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , these results also explain why , at least within dmft , the single - band model fails in describing a true resistive transition towards a gap - collapsed metal . in this model metallic and insulating solutions around the mott transition </S>",
    "<S> do not differ by any extensive observable that can be tuned by means of an external field , but simply for the existence ( metal ) or not ( insulator ) of a very narrow quasiparticle peak at fermi that can accommodate only a few percent of carriers . </S>",
    "<S> for that same reason , the region of parameters where an insulator is stable while a metal does exist as a metastable state is extremely narrow , actually vanishing at zero temperature , and essentially the whole stability region of the insulator behaves like our solution in the deep mott insulator beyond the spinodal point .    on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly demonstrate that the coexistence of two distinct phases with a sharp difference in the value of the orbital polarization is the key to observe a genuine resistive transition . </S>",
    "<S> a similar mechanism could be active in a wide class of models for which the `` polarization '' of another , model dependent , degree of freedom starkly distinguishes the metal from the insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the application of an external field would change the polarization favoring the metallic state , ultimately driving the resistive transition . </S>",
    "<S> we thus argue that the results we obtained for a specific model are in fact generic to essentially every `` narrow gap '' mott insulator as long as it is sufficiently close to a first - order mott transition to host a metastable metallic solution competing with the insulating ground state . </S>"
