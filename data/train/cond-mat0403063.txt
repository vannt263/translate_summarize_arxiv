    "despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies , understanding of the electronic properties and magnetic coupling of eub@xmath1 still provides challenges . while having a simple crystal structure , consisting of a simple cubic lattice of eu atoms with a b@xmath1 octahedron located in the center of each cubic cell , nevertheless the transport and magnetic properties of this system are complex .",
    "eub@xmath1 orders ferromagnetically at 15.1 k , which is accompanied by a huge decrease of resistivity and a significant blue shift of the reflectivity plasma edge.@xcite at 12.7 k another phase transition takes place , which is observed as a broad peak in the specific heat or an anomaly in the resistivity.@xcite the origin of this transition is still unclear , with possible explanations including spin reorientation @xcite or a long - wavelength modulation of the spin density.@xcite besides these properties , eub@xmath1 exhibits a rather sluggish increase of magnetization with decreasing temperature @xcite and unusual pressure dependence of the curie temperature with strong increase up to 70 kbar and a flat dependence at higher pressures.@xcite    the lda electronic structure of eub@xmath1 was previously investigated by hasegawa and yanase @xcite and massida _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite small overlap of conduction and valence bands was found resulting in fermi surface pockets centered at the x point of the brillouin zone .",
    "isostructural cab@xmath1 and srb@xmath1 have similar bandstructures , which have seemed to be consistent with their observed transport properties @xcite ( although they are not understood in any detail ) .",
    "recently cab@xmath1 has been studied with several variants of the gw method : the conventional pseudopotential gw,@xcite and all - electron gw,@xcite and a self - consistent gw method.@xcite while there are differing results among these , the majority of them predict the opening of a gap of the order of 1 ev , making the lda conclusions about the groundstate of divalent hexaborides questionable .",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission measurements @xcite reported a bandgap in cab@xmath1 , and only recently has it been demonstrated that synthesis from ultrapure boron@xcite leads to transport properties that are characteristic of a semiconductor rather than a semimetal . for the paramagnetic phase of eub@xmath1 , a bandgap was also observed,@xcite below an occupied electron pocket at the x point that was interpreted as carriers resulting from ( a high density of b ) vacancies .",
    "recently the transport properties have been interpreted in terms of a similar model.@xcite    as usual in lda - based band structure calculations of rare earth systems , the 4@xmath0 states must be treated in a special way in order to insure their correct filling . in order to enforce the correct filling the @xmath3 states were treated separately from the rest of the system in ref . , neglecting any hybridization involving the @xmath0 states and thus giving no insight into magnetic coupling mechanisms in eub@xmath1 .",
    "here we use the lda+u method , which obtains the correct @xmath3 state filling while keeping these @xmath3 states in the same hilbert space as the rest of the system , and so allows for mixing of @xmath3 states with the valence states .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the effective exchange interaction between the localized @xmath0 moments and the band electrons . for this purpose",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the orbital character and dispersion of the states close to the fermi level . based on this analysis",
    "we suggest an unusual two band kondo lattice model to be the relevant picture for understanding the magnetic behavior of eub@xmath1 .",
    "the calculations were performed using the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - waves ( flapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite the lda+u method was used with the double - counting scheme of anisimov and collaborators.@xcite the standard parametrization of the on - site coulomb interaction involves two parameters u and j. however , since we are dealing with the eu@xmath4 @xmath5 ion , which has completely filled spin - up @xmath0 shell and completely empty spin - down @xmath0 shell , the role of j reduces to merely renormalizing the u value .",
    "therefore we can set j=0 and quote just the u value .",
    "all the presented calculations were performed with lda exchange - correlation potential in the parameterization of perdew and wang.@xcite the calculations were performed without spin - orbit coupling in the scalar relativistic approximation as implemented of wien2k code .",
    "the following computational parameters were used .",
    "the atomic radii were 2.7 and 1.5 bohr for eu and b respectively .",
    "the apw+lo basis set @xcite , with additional local orbitals for eu @xmath6 and @xmath7 states , was characterized by plane - wave cut - off @xmath8 .",
    "we used 56 k - points in 1/48 irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the numerical convergence of the total energy was better than 0.1 mry .",
    "the internal parameter was relaxed so that the corresponding force was smaller than 1 mry / a.u .",
    "we have performed total energy vs. volume calculations in order to ( i ) determine the theoretical equilibrium volume and bulk modulus and ( ii ) investigate the influence of pressure on the band structure .",
    "for each value of lattice constant we have optimized the nearest - neighbor b - b distance ( the only free internal parameter ) using atomic forces . the calculated energy vs. volume curve is shown in fig .",
    "the inset shows the scaling of b - b distances with the lattice constant indicating that the bonds within b - octahedra are more rigid than the nearest - neighbor ( inter - octahedra ) b - b bond .",
    "the calculated equilibrium volume of 70.1 @xmath9 is about 96 % of the experimental value.@xcite the calculated bulk modulus of 161 gpa is agrees very well with the experimental value.@xcite the present results were obtained with u=7 ev , however similar calculations performed for u=6 , 8 , and 9 ev ( without optimization of the internal parameter ) showed that the bulk properties are insensitive to the value of u.      in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] we show the spin - polarized bandstructure obtained at the experimental lattice constant with u=7 ev . taken literally , the bandstructure indicates a metallic ground - state with band overlap ( negative gap ) around x point in both spin channels .",
    "more importantly the overlap of majority ( spin up ) bands is strongly enhanced in comparison to minority ( spin down ) bands .",
    "the origin of the different band overlap is the opposite sign of the up / down exchange splitting induced in the conduction and valence band .",
    "while lowering of the energy of the spin - up conduction band with respect to the spin - down band points to parallel coupling of conduction electrons to the local @xmath0 moments , the energy of the spin - up valence band is higher than that of the spin - down band indicating antiparallel coupling to the local @xmath0 moments . in the following we investigate in detail origin of this particular effective exchange coupling",
    "there are 6 symmetry related x points in the brillouin zone of simple cubic structure .",
    "the following analysis is performed particularly for x=(0,0,1/2 ) and all references to spatial orientation the orbitals are with respect to this choice .",
    "also , we do not distinguish between directions in real and k - space , which is not confusing for orthogonal unit cell .",
    "the modulus of the wave - function corresponding to valence band maximum at the x point is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : val1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : val2 ] we show the schematic plot of the same wave function in terms of b-@xmath2 and eu-@xmath0 orbitals .",
    "let us make several observations : ( i ) @xmath2-orbitals of b atoms at ( 1/2,1/2,z ) do not contribute to this wavefunction while the other b atoms ( which lie in the z=1/2 plane ) contribute their @xmath10 or @xmath11 orbitals , ( ii ) hybridization between @xmath2 orbitals in the neighboring unit cells ( in x - m direction ) is forbidden by symmetry at the x point , ( iii ) dispersion in the @xmath12-x direction in enhanced by hybridization with eu @xmath0 orbital of xyz symmetry ( note that this hybridization is allowed due to a phase shift of @xmath13 between adjacent eu layers and thus is forbidden at @xmath12 point ) .",
    "together points ( ii ) and ( iii ) explain the convex dispersion of the valence band with the top at the x point .",
    "the hybridization with eu @xmath0 also explains the antiparallel coupling of the valence electrons to the local @xmath0 moments .",
    "the spin up valence orbital hybridizes strongly with the occupied @xmath0 state localized close to the fermi level and thus its energy is increased due to band repulsion .",
    "the hybridization shift ( level repulsion ) in the spin down channel is much weaker and of opposite sign , since the unoccupied @xmath0 are localized high above the fermi level due to the on - site coulomb repulsion . as a result",
    "we obtain an effective antiferromagnetic exchange interaction of kinematic origin in the way described by the periodic anderson model.@xcite    similar analysis is performed now for conduction band . by analyzing the orbital contributions to the conduction band we find that it contains a mixture of b-@xmath2 and eu-@xmath14 states , where the @xmath14 content decreases when going away from the x point and vanishes at the @xmath12 point .",
    "we show the calculated modulus of the wave - function corresponding to the conduction band at the x point in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond1 ] and the corresponding schematic plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond2 ] .",
    "we make following observations : ( i ) the only orbitals that contribute significantly are @xmath15 orbitals localized on b atoms in the z=1/2 plane and eu @xmath16 orbitals , ( ii ) at the x point the @xmath2 orbitals in the neighboring unit cells ( in x - m direction ) form a bonding orbital , which can hybridize with eu @xmath16 orbital , going away in the x - m direction introduces a phase shift between @xmath2 orbitals in neighboring cells a reduces hybridization with the @xmath14 states , eventually at the m point the @xmath2 orbitals form an antibonding combination and hybridization with @xmath14 s is suppressed , ( iii ) looking along x-@xmath12 direction we find that the phase shift of @xmath13 at x point allows the @xmath2 states to hybridize with eu @xmath16 states while this mixing is forbidden at @xmath12 point . in conclusion the points ( ii ) and ( iii ) explain the concave dispersion of the conduction band with bottom at the x point .",
    "the conduction band originates from the b @xmath2 band which mixes strongly with eu @xmath16 band close to the x point .",
    "this picture is corroborated by the bandstructure of the empty boron lattice ( without eu atoms ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cage ] , which contains a similar conduction band but with greatly reduced dispersion .",
    "the exchange interaction of the electrons in the conduction band with local @xmath0 moments is of ferromagnetic @xmath17 intra - atomic origin .",
    "both the reduced value of the exchange splitting as compared to higher lying @xmath14-bands and decrease of the exchange splitting when going away from x point are easily explained by variable content of the eu @xmath14 in the conduction band states as described in ( ii ) and ( iii ) .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that the mechanism of exchange with the local @xmath0 moments is rather different for conduction and valence electrons .",
    "the conduction electrons are polarized through intra - atomic exchange interaction between the eu @xmath14 and @xmath0 states .",
    "the strength of the interaction is determined mostly by the content of the @xmath14 orbital in a particular wavefunction and is independent of the energy of @xmath0 states .",
    "the polarization of valence electrons arises from different hybridization splitting in spin - up and spin - down channel .",
    "since the hybridization is negligible in the minority channel , the strength of the effective exchange is determined by hybridization shift of the majority valence states .",
    "this shift is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the @xmath0 and valence band .",
    "the position on the energy scale of the @xmath0 states is therefore crucial for determining the strength of the effective exchange .",
    "the position of the lower and upper @xmath3 bands is determined by two factors within the lda+u approach : ( i ) the center of gravity of the lda @xmath0 bands , ( ii ) the screened on - site coulomb interaction u. the center of gravity of the @xmath0 bands depends on charge transfer , but its lda position suffers from well - known self - interaction error .",
    "the additional terms in the lda+u hamiltonian enforce the splitting into lower and upper hubbard band and in an approximate way correct for the self - interaction error in the lower band . to calculate the precise value of u ,",
    "besides the fact that it is defined in a somewhat loose sense , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the typical u quoted for @xmath3 electrons after accounting for screening is between 7 and 9 ev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : splt ] we show the band overlap in the majority spin channel as a function of u from 6 to 9 ev .",
    "we point out that u around 7 ev yields the @xmath0 bands approximately 1 ev below the fermi level , which is the position deduced from optical experiments @xcite and therefore we assume the results for this value to be most realistic .",
    "the effect of applied pressure amounts to overall broadening of the bands and thus enhanced overlap of the conduction and valence bands at the x point . for a unit cell volume increase of about 10%",
    "a gap in the minority spin channel opens , while an appreciable overlap remains in the majority spin channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : splt ] ) .      in the previous sections we have described the origin of dispersion and effective exchange coupling with local @xmath0 moment in both valence and conduction bands . based on the band structure",
    "we suggest the following model hamiltonian to provide a reasonable description of the low energy physics : @xmath18      -\\\\ \\frac{1}{l}\\sum _ {     \\substack{i,{\\mathbf k}{\\mathbf k } ' \\\\ \\alpha\\beta } }     \\bigl [     j_{i,{\\mathbf k}{\\mathbf k}'}^v{\\mathbf s}_i\\cdot v_{{\\mathbf k}\\alpha}^{\\dagger }     { \\boldsymbol \\sigma}_{\\alpha\\beta}v_{{\\mathbf k}'\\beta }    + \\\\     j_{i,{\\mathbf k}{\\mathbf k}'}^c{\\mathbf s}_i\\cdot c_{{\\mathbf k}\\alpha}^{\\dagger }     { \\boldsymbol \\sigma}_{\\alpha\\beta}c_{{\\mathbf k}'\\beta }     \\bigr ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to valence and conduction bands respectively , @xmath21 is a total spin operator of the local @xmath0 moments and @xmath22 is the number of unit cells in the normalization volume .    obtaining parameters of the model hamiltonian from the bandstructure is not a straightforward task , in particular the choice of the reference non - interacting state is tricky .",
    "it was shown by schiller and nolting @xcite and further discussed by mller and nolting @xcite that in case of k - independent exchange parameter @xmath23 , the majority - spin band is rigidly shifted with respect to its non - interacting counterpart , while the minority - spin band is modified beyond the rigid shift due to interaction with the local moments .",
    "the situation in eub@xmath1 is more complicated since , as discussed below in detail , the exchange parameter is strongly k - dependent for purely chemical reasons ( hybridization ) .",
    "it is therefore not possible to distinguish unambiguously the deviation of the exchange splitting @xmath24 from a rigid band shift arising from the correlation effects in the minority - spin band from that originating in the chemical k - dependence of the exchange parameter @xmath23 . since the k - dependence of the exchange splitting @xmath24 along the x-@xmath12 and x - m directions is very pronounced and can be qualitatively understood in terms of k - dependent exchange parameter @xmath23 we neglect the correlation effects in the minority spin channel .    the non - interacting dispersion relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 obtained from the bandstructure ( fig . [ fig : band ] ) are considered separately .",
    "the interaction of the conduction electrons with the local moments is dominated by the @xmath17 intra atomic exchange depending only on the @xmath14 content in a particular conduction state .",
    "the non - interacting conduction band is then approximated by an average of the spin - up and spin - down bands . since the hybridization in the majority band is the source of the exchange splitting in the valence band , the non - interacting valence band is well approximated by the spin - down band .",
    "the fermi level is located close to the top , resp .",
    "bottom , of the valence , resp .",
    "conduction , band and so the low energy bandstructure can be parametrized by anisotropic effective masses and the band overlap .",
    "the effective mass tensor for an ellipsoid of revolution is characterized by only two independent parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to x - m and x-@xmath12 dispersion respectively .",
    "the effective masses obtained by parabolic fit from the bandstructure ( fig . [ fig : band ] ) are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the band overlap of the non - interacting bands at x point is 0.34 ev .",
    "we point out that using the spin - up conduction band as a non - interacting reference ( rigidly shifted ) does not lead to significant modification of the effective masses .",
    "since the mechanisms of effective exchange with local moments are different we have to discuss determination of the corresponding coupling constants @xmath33 separately . the @xmath34 dependent coupling constants can not be determined directly from the bandstructure and additional assumptions must be made .",
    "we start with the conduction band .",
    "we mentioned earlier that the conduction band coupling to the local moment is mostly due to intra - atomic @xmath17 exchange described by @xmath35 which leads to @xmath36 however , the conduction band is not a pure @xmath14-band , but contains a mixture of @xmath14 and @xmath2 orbitals @xmath37 . treating @xmath38 as a first order perturbation leads to an effective coupling of the conduction of the form @xmath39 here @xmath40 can be chosen at convenience as real and positive .",
    "finally we make connection to the band structure by observation that the k - dependent exchange splitting of the conduction band is given by @xmath41 finally putting ( [ eq : jc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : jc2 ] ) together we obtain @xmath42 the k - dependent exchange splitting of the conduction band is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] .",
    "vanishing of the exchange splitting when the @xmath12 and m points are approached can be understood in terms of simple nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping picture .",
    "the k - dependent hybridization between @xmath2 and @xmath14 bands vanishes at @xmath12 and m , and thus the valence states have a pure @xmath2 character at these points .",
    "the @xmath43 nn hopping in the conduction band has the same symmetry as the @xmath44 hopping in the valence band leading to the same k - dependence of the hybridization ( [ eq : hyba ] ) and ( [ eq : hybb ] ) discussed below .    for the valence band",
    "the effective exchange coupling arises by schrieffer ",
    "wolff transformation @xcite from anderson lattice hamiltonian with the @xmath45 hopping term @xmath46 the corresponding exchange parameter for states close to the fermi level ( i.e. far enough from the @xmath0 band ) is given by @xmath47 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the energy of the occupied @xmath0 states and @xmath49 is the energy of the unoccupied @xmath0 states .",
    "as in the case of the conduction band we have to make additional assumption in order to extract information about @xmath50 from the bandstructure .",
    "the natural assumption in terms of the local orbitals is to expect non - zero hopping @xmath51 only between the nearest neighbor @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( xyz ) orbitals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : val2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : delta ] we show the k - dependent exchange splitting together with the expected k - dependence . for the x - m direction",
    "we show only the region close to the fermi level .",

    "field should be realistic in many respects .",
    "a similar approach was taken by korenblit@xcite without providing detailed results .",
    "we focus on the role of the exchange enhanced band overlap and its consequences . in the mean field approximation",

    "the quantities @xmath67 are the occupations of the bands . going to the hole picture of the valence band and using the charge neutrality condition to determine the fermi level we obtain the following set of equations @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the brillouin function for @xmath70 .",
    "we have solved the mean field equations using the effective masses listed above . to make the analysis as simple as possible we approximate the coupling parameters @xmath23 with a single k - independent constant ( with opposite sign for the valence and conduction bands ) . to assess sensitivity of the model to the choice of @xmath23",
    ", we have used two values : ( i ) @xmath71 ev corresponding to the x point exchange splitting of 0.28 ev ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and ( ii ) @xmath72 ev used by korenblit.@xcite the calculated ordered moment vs. temperature @xmath73 curves are shown in fig .",
    "there are two distinct regimes .",
    "\\(i ) for band overlap @xmath74 ( i.e. bandgap of @xmath75 ) there is a minimum ordered moment @xmath76 necessary to establish the overlap of spin - up bands . below this value",
    "the magnetization can not be self - stabilized since the corresponding effective field @xmath77 is zero .",
    "solution of equation ( 15 ) can be visualized as the intersection , on the interval ( 0,7/2 ] , of the right - hand side @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 , given by ( 14 ) , and the straight line @xmath80 of the left - hand side .",
    "the right - hand side is zero for @xmath81 and , from definition of @xmath69 , less or equal to 7/2 .",
    "this means that curve representing the right - hand side must cross the line representing the left - hand side an even number of times since it is continuous and its initial and final points are in the same half - plane determined by the left - hand side .",
    "therefore there must be an even number of non - zero solutions of ( 15 ) for @xmath74 and a given temperature . in our case",
    "it means either zero or two solutions .    in order to identify , in the two solution case , the solution with lower free energy we approximate the total free energy by the sum of the free energy of non - interacting valence and conduction electrons evaluated with the selfconsistent value of the effective field @xmath77 and the free energy of non - interacting local moments in the effective field @xmath77 at a given temperature . in all cases we find that the solution with larger ordered moment corresponds to the lower free energy .",

    "nonmagnetic one .",

    "one of the controversial questions concerning divalent alkaline earth hexaborides is whether the groundstate is insulating or metallic at stoichiometry .",
    "the experimental as well as theoretical evidence is controversial .",
    "recent lda calculations by massidda _",
    "et al _ @xcite neglecting the magnetic order yield a metallic band structure for eub@xmath1 similar to that of cab@xmath1 or srb@xmath1 with a small band overlap of about 0.3 ev . the selfconsistent gw calculation @xcite finds cab@xmath1 to be a semiconductor with a band gap of the order of 1 ev , as does the more conventional pseudopotential gw calculation.@xcite the gw method is known to provide good bandgaps for many semiconductors where the lda gaps are strongly underestimated or even vanishing .",
    "the effect of gw self - energy corrections on the eub@xmath1 bandstructure is expected to be similar , thus reducing the band overlap and possibly opening a band gap by shifting the conduction band upwards .",
    "an important difference between eub@xmath1 and cab@xmath1 is the presence of @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "we have shown that the exchange interaction with the band electrons is opposite in sign for the valence and conduction bands , so magnetic order can significantly increase the overlap of the majority spin band while it has opposite effect for the minority spin .",
    "although the effective exchange with the valence band depends on the position of the @xmath3 states and thus varies somewhat with the parameter u , general experience with rare earth systems as well as optical measurements on eub@xmath1 @xcite indicate that u of 7 ev ( placing the eu @xmath3 1 ev below the fermi level ) is realistic .",
    "based on these arguments it is plausible that the realistic ground state picture of stochiometric eub@xmath1 is that of a _ half metallic semimetal_. this unprecedented band structure would result from a ferromagnetic gw calculation in which the band shifts ( relative to the static lda+u ) are large open a gap in the minority spin channel , but not so large as to open a gap in the majority spin channel .",
    "such a scenario has some experimental support .",
    "van alphen data provide clear indication of fermi surfaces , but only two pockets are seen.@xcite this number of sheets is contrary to the expected four pockets suggested by lda ( and lda+u ) band structure , but two sheets are exactly what is expected of a half metallic semimetal .",
    "the observed behavior of the resistivity is also consistent with such a picture . in the magnetically ordered state , metallic conduction takes place in the majority spin channel . just above the magnetic ordering temperature",
    "the system can be viewed as consisting of disordered magnetic domains ( due to short range ferromagnetic correlations ) , and the increase of resistivity upon disordering is due to mismatch of the conducting spin channels between these domains ( like the  intergrain tunneling mechanism \" of giant magnetoresistance materials ; see _ e.g. _ ref . ) .",
    "increasing the temperature further leads to breakdown of the short range order , the paramagnetic bandstructure becomes increasingly appropriate , and the inter - domain magnetoresistance effect disappears , as observed .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission data @xcite do not seem to fit well into this picture , but further photoemission studies in the ordered phase , and identifying the position and influence of the @xmath0 states , seems to be necessary to clarify several remaining questions .",
    "the very large number of electron carriers that the photoemission data , if assumed to be representative of the bulk , does not fit so well with data that suggest rather clean single crystals .",
    "if the carriers are due to unbalanced surface charge , then the observed bands are not representative of the bulk .",
    "finally , the broken inter - octahedron b - b bonds should give rise to surface states ( or bands ) , and the implication of the photoemission data will never be unambiguous until the surface electronic structure is identified and understood .",
    "finally we discuss briefly our mean field treatment of the two band kondo lattice model hamiltonian .",
    "we expect that the least reliable quantity obtained from the electronic structure calculation is the band overlap , and we have treated it as a parameter in the mean field study .",
    "the two band hamiltonian even in mean field approximation leads to a strongly temperature dependent coupling between the local moments , which is reflected by unusual magnetization dependences distinct from the canonical behavior of the heisenberg hamiltonian in mean field .",
    "the solutions for small positive band overlap exhibit a slow approach to saturation as observed,@xcite as well as an increase of the ordering temperature with pressure,@xcite _ i.e. _ with increasing band overlap .",
    "the ordering temperatures obtained with the _ ab inito _ value of the exchange parameter @xmath23 are , however , too low compared to experiment .",
    "we mention several possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , we have completely neglected the k - dependence of the exchange parameter @xmath23 .",
    "second , equation ( 8) shows that the value of @xmath87 is quite sensitive to the position of the occupied @xmath3 levels , which we know only approximately . and finally , some mechanisms of effective exchange between the local moments arising from the anderson model are lost when transformed to the kondo model ( e.g. superexchange ) .",
    "these mechanisms might be of importance in the @xmath74 case leading to removal of the first order transition .",
    "the mean field study does serve to demonstrate the potential usefulness of the two - band hamiltonian and to stimulate further studies by more advanced techniques , such as the green s function approach of nolting _",

    "<S> with a treatment of the 4@xmath0 states of eub@xmath1 based on lda+u method , the mixing of eu @xmath0 states with b @xmath2 states around the x point of the brillouin zone is shown to have unexpected consequences for the effective exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the orbital character of electronic states close to the fermi level and discuss the effective exchange between the itinerant electrons and the local @xmath3 moments . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis suggests that the ordered phase may provide the first example of a _ half metallic semimetal _ , and that the physics of eub@xmath1 should be described in terms of a two band kondo lattice model with parallel ( ferromagnetic ) coupling of the conduction electrons and antiparallel ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling of the valence electrons to the local @xmath3 moments . </S>"
