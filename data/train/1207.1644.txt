    "there has always been curiosity in obtaining exact solutions in einstein s theory that contain new sources to encompass the underlying spacetime curvature .",
    "this covers sources such as scalar ( charged , uncharged ) , cosmological constant , electromagnetism ( linear , non - linear , electric , magnetic ) , yang - mills ( ym ) fields plus others as well as their combinations .",
    "the necessity of enrichment in sources can be traced back to gauge / gravity duality , but may find better justification from the more recent holographic superconductivity analogy .",
    "once spherical symmetry and asymptotic flatness in the spacetime ansatz are assumed severe restrictions on possible solutions are inevitable .",
    "the uniqueness theorems and no - hair conjectures are a few of such restrictions that the solutions obtained must comply with .    in a recent study",
    "minimally coupled scalar field has been considered in einstein - maxwell theory with anti - de sitter ( ads ) asymptotics @xcite - a ( more recently , the same authors studied also the static , planar solutions of einstein - scalar gravity which results an anti - de sitter vacuum @xcite - b ) .    in @xcite beside kinetic lagrangian terms due to the scalar and maxwell fields an additional potential @xmath4 constructed from scalar field has been supplemented .",
    "constancy of such a potential can naturally be interpreted as a cosmological term . in some specific cases the scalar field",
    "is assumed to be of the form @xmath5 and upon this choice the potential @xmath4 can be determined from the dynamical equations . among other things",
    "the model is shown to admit asymptotic lifshitz black holes .    in this paper",
    "we add yang - mills ( ym ) field instead of maxwell to the einstein - minimally coupled scalar field system and search for the resulting solutions .",
    "our pure magnetic ym field is added through the wu - yang ansatz which was introduced before @xcite , and is known to extend easily to all higher dimensions .",
    "our model of einstein - scalar - ym system contains an indispensable potential function @xmath4 as a function of the scalar field . with the exception of specific dimensions and scalar field our solutions",
    "do not admit immediately recognizable asymptotes . in @xmath3dimensions , for instance",
    "we obtain an eym - scalar solution which asymptotes to an anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "although spherical symmetry allows more general ansatzes our choice in this paper will be such that @xmath6 , while the coefficient of the unit angular line element @xmath7 is an arbitrary function @xmath8 .",
    "the asymptotic flatness condition requires that @xmath9 , which should be discarded in the present case since it annules the scalar field through the field equations .",
    "we observe also that non - trivial scalar and ym fields must coexist only by virtue of a non - zero potential @xmath4 .",
    "the choice @xmath10constant ( or zero ) admits no scalar solution .",
    "overall , our solutions can be interpreted as hairy black holes in an asymptotically non - flat spacetime . by setting the scalar field to zero",
    "we recover the eym black holes obtained before @xcite .",
    "our model is exemplified with specific parameters of scalar hair .",
    "next , in @xmath11dimensional bulk spacetime we define a @xmath12dimensional domain - wall ( dw ) as a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe by the proper boundary ( junction ) conditions given long ago by darmois and israel @xcite .",
    "we establish such a dw universe and explore the conditions under which the frw universe has double bounces .",
    "that is , the radius function of frw universe will lie in between the minimum and maximum values .",
    "we had shown previously the existence of such double bounces in different theories @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our formalism of eym system with a scalar field and potential is introduced in section ii .",
    "section iii presents exact solution to the system under certain ansatzes .",
    "section iv gives a solution with a different scalar field ansatz in 6-dimensional spacetime that asymptots to anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "domain wall dynamics in our bulk space is introduced in section v. our conclusion appears in section vi .",
    "following the formalism given in @xcite with the same unit convention ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) the @xmath11dimensional einstein - yang - mills gravity coupled minimally to a scalar field @xmath1 is given by @xmath14\\]]in which @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is an arbitrary function of the scalar field @xmath1 .",

    "it is needless to restate that the roles of @xmath87 and @xmath71 change , i.e. @xmath71 becomes a time - like coordinate .",
    "the asymptotic metrics ( 35 ) and ( 37 ) suggest also that we have no lifshitz @xcite asymptotes .",
    "in this section we consider a different ansatz for the scalar field which reads@xmath89 in which @xmath90 and @xmath91 are some real constants .",
    "we plug @xmath1 into ( 14 ) to find @xmath92 in which @xmath93 is an integration constant and @xmath94 we note that due to this condition @xmath95 remains bounded as@xmath96and consequently@xmath97the general solution given for @xmath98 unfortunately is not integrable in closed form for a general dimension @xmath99 and for a general @xmath95 .",
    "but one can see that in @xmath99 dimension a specific choice for i.e. , @xmath100 yields @xmath101which in turn must give the general eym solution for @xmath102 this , of course , implies @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 which casts the solution into@xmath106also the corresponding potential @xmath107 reads@xmath108which means that @xmath109 represents the cosmological constant .",
    "another case that we can integrate ( 23 ) is @xmath88 with @xmath110 ( consequently @xmath111 ) giving@xmath112for @xmath113 we add also that to get the correct flat limit we set @xmath114 and @xmath115 our other integration constant @xmath116 is related to the mass of the black hole solution so we set it as @xmath117 . here",
    "it worths to see @xmath118 which clearly implies that the solution admits an event horizon and therefore the solution is a black hole .",

    "let s impose now the following condition @xmath141 in which the location of the dw is given by @xmath142 , with the proper time @xmath143 .",
    "therefore the line element on the dw becomes @xmath144which is a frw metric in @xmath133dimensions with the radius function @xmath145 .",
    "imposing the boundary conditions i.e. , the darmois - israel conditions on the wall @xcite leads to @xmath146where @xmath147is the surface energy - momentum tensor on the dw .",
    "note that a bracket ( @xmath148 ) denotes a jump across @xmath132 .",
    "the latter yields @xmath149which after ( 50 ) and ( 52 ) , gives the energy density @xmath37 and the surface pressures @xmath150 for generic metric functions @xmath151 and @xmath32 with @xmath142 .",

    "using above with some manipulation we obtain the one - dimensional equation @xmath167where the effective potential is defined by @xmath168 in order that ( 62 ) admits a solution as the radius on the dw universe we must have @xmath169 , which naturally restricts the probable forms of the potential function @xmath0 .",

    "ansatz the picture may change entirely .",

    "specifically , we are interested to construct a dw brane as a frw universe which admits both a minimum and a maximum bounces .",
    "we have shown that this is possible , so that once our world is such a brane it will oscillate between these limits ad infinitum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . finally , since a constant potential amounts to a cosmological term a space - filling uniform scalar field may be the cause of the cosmological constant .",
