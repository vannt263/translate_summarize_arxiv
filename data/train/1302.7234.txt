    "in experiments that measure general relativistic effects , some parameters characterizing the spacetime have to be determined .",
    "the multipole moments are one set of such parameters .",
    "they are measured in the exterior region of astrophysical objects like neutron stars or galaxies but also planets and describe the gravitational field near spatial infinity .",
    "they will be called here _ asymptotic multipole moments _ ( amm ) .",
    "the bending of light and the gravitational lensing proofed particularly useful for their measurement , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "but what information can be gathered about the matter distribution and the metric in its interior by their measurement ? what does it mean to measure a quadrupole moment of a certain amount ?",
    "in newtonian theory , the answers are provided by the source integrals of the amm .",
    "these integrals determine the asymptotic multipole moments by an integration over the mass density .",
    "in general relativity , similar expressions for the amm are only known in approximations to general relativity , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "we will present source integrals of the amm for static and axially symmetric spacetimes in full general relativity . at the same time",
    "these provide quasi - local definitions of _ all _ asymptotic multipole moments .",
    "in this section , we shortly review several concepts necessary in the derivation of the source integrals .",
    "we use throughout this article geometric units @xmath0 and the signature of the metric is @xmath1 .",
    "we concentrate on axially symmetric and static spacetimes of the weyl form , i.e. , @xmath2 we do not restrict the type of matter except in that the line element can be introduced , see @xcite .",
    "the metric functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be expressed by the timelike killing vector @xmath5 and the killing vector of the axial symmetry @xmath6",
    "@xmath7    let us choose a sphere @xmath8 of finite radius @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) that covers the entire matter distribution , cf .",
    "[ fig : curves ] . outside of @xmath8 ,",
    "canonical weyl coordinates ( @xmath11 ) are introduced by virtue of one of the vacuum field equations .",
    "this allows still a shift in the @xmath12coordinate , which enables us later to move the origin with respect to which the amm are measured .",
    "the vacuum field equations read in canonical weyl coordinates @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 is determined via a line integration , cf .",
    "the last two equations of , once @xmath16 is known .",
    "hence , only a laplace equation for @xmath16 remains to be solved in practise .",
    "an example of the physical situations discussed here : the surfaces of the individual matter components are denoted by @xmath17 with @xmath18 and their respective volumes by @xmath19 .",
    "the surface @xmath20 describes a circle with sufficiently large but finite radius enclosing all matter components , cf .",
    "[ sec : line_element ] . ]",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] an example of a physical situation that will be covered by the subsequent considerations .",
    "the relevant surfaces and volumes are defined there as well . for simplicity , we allow only non - singular sources .",
    "however , such can be incorporated into the formalism as we showed in @xcite .",
    "the 3-dimensional projection of the matter region into an hypersurface of constant killing - time @xmath21 is obtained by an rotation around the @xmath12axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] . in this way",
    ", the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined starting from @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .      for asymptotically flat and static spacetimes a geometric definition of amm was given by geroch in @xcite .",
    "this definition was generalized and applied by many authors , see the reviews @xcite and references therein . in the axially symmetric case with the line element , geroch",
    "s multipole moments @xmath28 can be obtained by an expansion of @xmath16 along the symmetry axis in @xmath29 : @xmath30 the @xmath28 follow uniquely from weyl s multipole moments @xmath31 and vice versa as was shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider only the @xmath31 here .",
    "lastly , we shortly review the inverse scattering technique ( ist ) , see e.g. @xcite for a recent account .",
    "even though the laplace equation is linear and the use of the ist seems artificial , the ist proves nonetheless beneficial , because it is easily generalizable to the non - linear case of the ernst equation .",
    "this equation is of special interest in relativistic astrophysics , since it describes the exterior of rotating stars .",
    "the starting point of the ist in the present setting , i.e. the linear problem of the laplace equation , is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , the spectral parameter @xmath34 , @xmath35 and a bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the complex valued function @xmath36 depends on @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the integrability condition of eqs . is the laplace equation for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , having a solution @xmath36 of eq .",
    "yields also a solution @xmath16 of the laplace equation and vice versa .",
    "the main technical steps of the ist as described in @xcite are to integrate along @xmath39 , along a circle with sufficiently large radius and along a compact curve connecting @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "this scheme can be carried out partially and we quote only the results ( simplified to the static case ) , which are relevant for us , from @xcite :    [ eq : axis_values_sigma ] @xmath42 the function @xmath43 is given for @xmath44 with @xmath45 by @xmath46    the integration along @xmath47 does not enter the derivation of these formulas and it forms the crucial part of our considerations in the next section .",
    "the derivation of the source integrals consists of several steps .",
    "first , the amm are expressed as line integrals along @xmath20 .",
    "this is the most important step , because it makes it possible to determine the amm quasi - locally .",
    "then these integrals will be rewritten in a coordinate independent form as surface integrals over @xmath48 by virtue of the axial symmetry .",
    "subsequently , stokes theorem is used to rewrite these as volume integrals over @xmath49 . in the final step",
    ", it is shown that the contributions in the vacuum regions vanish .",
    "thus , the steps from before can be retraced to obtain the contributions in source integral form of each individual matter component .",
    "we suppress the details of these derivations and show only the crucial steps .",
    "the linear problem is well - defined along @xmath47 and reads : @xmath50\\sigma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the tangential and the ( outward pointing ) normal derivative of @xmath16 along @xmath20 with respect to a parametrisation @xmath53\\to \\mathcal s_0^{(2)}$ ] . the indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to the values of a parameter or function at the `` north '' and `` south '' pole of @xmath56 , i.e. , to the intersection points @xmath57 of @xmath20 and the symmetry axis .",
    "is easily integrated using the boundary values from eq .",
    ": @xmath58 if we expand this equation in @xmath59 , we obtain expression for weyl s multipole moments in terms of a line integration .",
    "let us introduce the abbreviations @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the expansion coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 to order @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "after a lengthy but straightforward calculation they evaluate to @xmath65    the @xmath66 order in @xmath59 of eq .",
    "is satisfied trivially and will not be considered subsequently .",
    "the orders @xmath67 of eq .",
    "yield the desired quasi - local definitions of weyl s multipole moments : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the tangential and normal derivatives along @xmath20 with respect to the unit tangent vector and the unit normal vector , which are defined with the induced metric on @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath71 denotes the proper distance along @xmath47 .",
    "the functions @xmath72 and @xmath16 are to be read as functions along @xmath47 , i.e. as functions of @xmath73 .    to make the coordinate independence apparent , we express @xmath74 and @xmath75 by scalars build from the killing vectors .",
    "firstly , observe that eq .",
    "holds everywhere and that in vacuum we have @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , the 1-form @xmath76 is well - defined and hypersurface orthogonal everywhere as well as exact in the vacuum region .",
    "hence , there exist a potential @xmath77 and an integrating factor @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 in the exterior of @xmath81 . in the vacuum region and in canonical",
    "weyl coordinates , we find @xmath82 .",
    "since we can shift the @xmath75-coordinate freely , we can drop the constant of integration , which specifies the origin with respect to which the amm are measured .",
    "thus , @xmath4 and @xmath77 coincide with @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the vacuum region and can be used as their continuation into the interior of the matter .",
    "this choice is not unique and other continuations are possible , although they do not alter the values of the source integrals , which we present below .    using @xmath4 and @xmath77 along @xmath47 instead of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively",

    "the last equality is due to einstein s equations , which imply that the integrand vanishes in vacuum .",
    "the integrals are the desired source integrals .",
    "they determine the amm from the geometry inside the matter regions alone .",
    "of course , stokes theorem can again be used to rewrite the source integrals as surface integrals over @xmath23 of the respective matter component . in turn ,",
    "these can be reformulated as line integrals , cf .",
    "[ sec : applications ] . that the contributions of the individual matter components @xmath24 to the asymptotic multipole moments superpose linearly is due to the choice of weyl s multipole moments",
    ". if we employ the method from @xcite to calculate geroch s multipole moments @xmath28 from weyl s multipole moments @xmath31 , we obtain a mixing of the contributions @xmath86 of the individual matter components with @xmath87 in the @xmath28 .",
    "this is already apparent for the quadrupole moment @xmath88 , which depends non - linearly on @xmath89 : @xmath90    the geroch mass @xmath91 equals @xmath89 and is given by the ( negative ) komar integral .",
    "this follows also from eq . with @xmath92",
    "we conclude the paper discussing one possible application of the source integrals .",
    "assume a matter distribution is given , where the metric is known in the interior or the dirichlet and the neumann data for @xmath16 are known at the surface .",
    "even then it is far from trivial ( at least in the stationary case , see @xcite ) to obtain a global asymptotically flat solution , if it exists .",
    "the source integrals for the amm provide a tool to solve this task . as a simple example serves here the case of static dust without any surface distributions . in weyl",
    "coordinates ( not necessarily canonical ) the energy momentum tensor is given by @xmath93 the contracted bianchi identities imply @xmath94 in the interior and , thus , the gradient of @xmath16 vanishes at @xmath23 in all coordinates . using the line integrals for weyl s amm , which follow from eq . ,",
    "we get : @xmath95 thus , all amm vanish and the spacetime is flat in the exterior .",
    "this contradicts the presence of a dust distribution with positive mass density . of course ,",
    "this result is already known and more general non - existence results for dust including the rotating case can be found in @xcite and references therein . although the non - existence is proved here , this example shows in a concise way how the source integrals can be applied in more difficult physical situations like rotating stars .",
    "this and other applications , e.g. to tidal distortions of black holes , will be investigated in future work .",
