    "cool neutral hydrogen ( ) , the raw material for star formation , is traced through the absorption of radio continuum radiation by the atoms undergoing the 21-cm spin - flip transition .",
    "the continuum can by intercepted by gas _ associated _ with the host galaxy of the radio source or within a galaxy _ intervening _ the line - of - sight to a more distant source .. a damped lyman-  absorber ( dla ) is defined as having a neutral hydrogen column density exceeding @xmath2 atoms per  and dlas could account for more than 80 per - cent of the neutral gas content in the universe @xcite . ] as well as tracing the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) back to @xmath3 , observations of  give insight into the mass assembly and distribution of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , a means of detecting the epoch of re - ionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) , in addition to the potential to obtain highly accurate measurements of the fundamental constants of nature at large look - back times ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of distant galaxies through 21-cm absorption is a science goal of the forthcoming square kilometre array ( ska , @xcite ) , which , through its large instantaneous bandwidth and large field - of - view , will avoid observational biases introduced by the conventional requirement of an optical redshift to which to tune the receiver :    * for the associated systems , the optical pre - selection biases toward high ultra - violet luminosities in the source rest - frame , which can be sufficient to ionise all of the neutral gas within the host galaxy @xcite , causing the observed paucity of associated 21-cm absorption at high redshift @xcite .",
    "* for the intervening absorbers , pre - selection using optical redshift biases against optically obscured sight - lines ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as absorbers rich in molecular gas @xcite .",
    "these are of particular interest since molecular lines provide excellent probes of the physical and chemical conditions of the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as the potential to obtain accurate measurements of the fundamental constants from a single species ( the oh radical ) , thus eliminating line - of - sight effects which could mimic an apparent change in the constants @xcite .    in order to obtain an unbiased census of the distribution and abundance of the cool neutral gas along each sight - line",
    ", it is therefore necessary to dispense with the optical pre - selection of targets which has dominated previous 21-cm absorption searches , in favour of using wide instantaneous bandwidths free of frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "coverage of the whole redshift space to @xmath4 is already possible with the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap , @xcite ) , although dispensing with optical spectroscopy does present an obstacle in determining the nature of the absorber ( see @xcite ) .    in both the near - by and redshifted active galaxies , 21-cm absorption profiles",
    "are often found to be broad ( @xmath5 , @xcite ) , due either to more than one deep component @xcite or additional broad , shallow `` wings '' to either side of the main component @xcite .",
    "this broadening of the additional shallow component is believed to arise from cold gas in the sub - pc , fast rotating central black hole accretion disk / obscuring torus , invoked by unified schemes of active galactic nuclei ( agn , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fast rotating / disturbed gas in the narrow - line region can lead to the broadening of the  profile in agn ( e.g. @xcite ) , whereas its absence in the more quiescent intervening absorbers results in generally narrower and less complex profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate the potential of using these differences in the associated and intervening profiles to classify the nature of a newly identified absorption in the absence of complementary optical data .",
    "such a method could provide an invaluable tool in forthcoming spectral scans with the next generation of large radio telescopes .",
    "as mentioned above , the use of optical redshifts can bias against the detection of 21-cm absorption and this , in conjunction with radio flux limits , the narrow bandwidths free of rfi and the limited frequency coverage of current telescopes , means that the detection of 21-cm absorption at @xmath0 ( look - back times of @xmath6 gyr ) is currently relatively rare , limited to 57 associated and 50 intervening cases ( fig .",
    "[ distbn ] ) .    however , we limit our analysis to these redshifts since we are interested in developing a technique to classify absorbers for future redshifted 21-cm surveys .",
    "exclusion of low redshift absorption also has several advantages :    * minimising contamination of the sample introduced by differences between the near - by and distant absorption profiles .",
    "even if there are no intrinsic evolutionary differences , the inclusion of spatially resolved absorption / emission , giving several sight - lines , is expected to confuse the analysis of the unresolved sources of interest .",
    "* dilution of the absorption profile by 21-cm emission , which is very faint beyond these redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this effect will be minimal where the spatial resolution is finest , although , again , the mixture of unresolved and resolved features could add confusion . *",
    "due , at least in part , to the optical pre - selection of 21-cm absorption searches , near - by intervening absorption is limited to 90 sight - lines ( see @xcite and reference therein ) , whereas the near - by associated absorbers have not been compiled .",
    "limiting the analysis to @xmath7 ensures approximately equal numbers of associated and intervening absorbers , which is important for class recognition by machine learning models ( see sect .",
    "[ mlr ] ) .      unlike at lower redshifts ,",
    "most of the @xmath0 detections are already compiled ( in tables [ ass_fits ] & [ int_fits ] , which are updated from @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . however , the raw data were generally unavailable and so the spectra were acquired from the literature by digitising the available figures . for this we used the getdata graph digitizer package for all the spectra , except those in @xcite , which were constructed from gaussian parameters presented .",
    "this process was successful for 55 associated and 43 intervening spectra , with unsuccessful acquisition resulting from noisy data or low - quality figures .",
    "the axes were then normalised by converting the ordinate to observed optical depth ( sect . [ rams ] ) and the abscissa to velocity dispersion , which was defined relative to the optical depth weighted mean velocity of the absorption profile , @xmath8 . for a spectrum sampled over @xmath9 components",
    "this is @xmath10 which is used to shift the abscissa so that @xmath11 .    in order to allow the spectra to be inter - compared and averaged , each was oversampled and then re - binned to a common spectral resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] ) .    ) . ]    since the spectra were shown over a variety of velocity ranges , generally proportional to the line - width , in order to ensure that the full mean velocity range was evenly weighted , we added the typical noise level of @xmath12 to each end of each spectrum to give each the same velocity range .",
    "half of the original spectra were presented as single or multiple gaussian fits and so , in order to include these , gaussian fits were applied to all of the over - sampled spectra . representing the spectra by gaussians was also useful in parameterising the spectra for comparison through machine learning ( sect .",
    "[ sec : fs ] ) . generally , the number of gaussian components quoted by the authors was used and when this was not given we used the minimum number necessary for a fit .",
    "fitting was done using the fityk 0.9.8 package which utilises the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , a least - squares fitting routine developed in particular for non - linear fitting .    in fig .",
    "[ weight ] we show the digitised spectra ,        from which we see a large variation in profile shapes , although the intervening tend to have narrower velocity dispersions .",
    "highlighting this , in fig .",
    "[ fwhm ] we show the distribution of the effective profile widths of the individual spectra ,    from which , we see that the associated are , on average , three times wider than the intervening profiles .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test gives a probability of @xmath13 that the associated and intervening velocity distributions are drawn from the same population , which is significant at @xmath14 , assuming gaussian statistics .",
    "it is therefore clear that the profile width is related to the absorption type : the narrower profile widths of the intervening absorbers being possibly due to the absence of the high dispersion component , in addition to the possibility that intervening absorption may be more favourably detected in galactic disks of high inclination ( close to face - on , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the associated absorbers are seen to be roughly equally distributed over the whole range of widths , which makes it difficult to predict the nature of the absorption based upon the fwhm distribution alone .",
    "although the profile widths of the individual spectra are too varied to effectively predict the absorber type , we can average the spectra in order to explore any strong statistical difference between the types .",
    "since the peak optical depth is not necessarily the centroid of the absorption , we average the spectra by the mean weighted absorption , where the zero velocity offset is defined by the median of the velocity integrated optical depth ( equ .",
    "[ equ : weight ] ) , giving a more consistent measure of redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .    from the mean spectra ( shown by the thick traces in fig .",
    "[ weight ] ) , it is clear the associated spectrum has additional low optical depth gas at large velocity dispersions ( @xmath15 ) . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , it has been hypothesised that this is due to additional fast moving neutral gas close to the nucleus , probably associated with the obscuring torus / accretion disk . in order to model this additional absorption , as a starting point in fig .",
    "[ 4-smooth ] ( top left ) we show the mean profiles , where the blue and redshifted components have been averaged .",
    "we then convert each optical depth ",
    "dispersion distribution to a column density  radial distribution , by quantifying how the velocity of the gas is expected to vary with galactocentric radius . in fig .",
    "[ 4-smooth ] ( top right )    we fit a polynomial to the velocity distribution of the milky way @xcite . being a large spiral this may not represent an accurate depiction of the large - scale rotation curve of an agn host .",
    "however , although early - type galaxies exhibit a variety of rotation curves , many exhibit similar curves to that of the milky way @xcite . furthermore , since we are interested in comparing the associated and intervening absorbers ( which themselves may arise in a wide variety of galaxy types , e.g. @xcite ) , the milky way provides a classic example of the rapid velocity increase within the central @xmath16 pc , before reaching velocities of @xmath17   at @xmath18 pc @xcite",
    "since the rotation curve of the milky way is only well mapped beyond @xmath19 pc , we supplement this with data from the circinus galaxy , a near - by spiral in which the rotation curve at inner radii is readily available .",
    "circinus is known to host a seyfert2 nucleus @xcite and so may at least provide a reasonable model of the inner regions of the associated absorbers . in order to match the velocities between the two galaxies ,",
    "each of the circinus values have been upscaled by a factor of 1.7 , which is close to the value expected based upon the scaling ratio between the nuclear black hole and host galaxy mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) , cf .",
    "@xmath20  for circinus @xcite .",
    "assuming circular orbits , this gives @xmath21 . ]",
    "once the velocity is mapped , the column density is obtained from @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the spin temperature of the gas , which is a measure of the excitation from the lower hyperfine level @xcite , and @xmath24 is the velocity integrated optical depth of the absorption .",
    "the observed optical depth is related to this via @xmath25 where the covering factor , @xmath26 , is a measure of the fraction of observed background flux ( @xmath27 ) intercepted by the absorber . in the optically thin regime ( where @xmath28 ) , equ .",
    "[ enew_full ] can be rewritten as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the dispersion of the absorption .",
    "assuming that the peak of the absorption occurs , on average , in the centre of the galaxy and that the gas is dynamically coupled to the sub - kpc rotation , the dispersion is related to the rotational velocity via @xmath31 .",
    "to obtain the column density , we assume a constant @xmath32  k across the disk , since this is a constant 250400  k across the milky way @xcite and a constant @xmath33  k ( @xmath34  k ) across external galaxies @xcite , with a mean of @xmath35  k ( @xmath36  k ) at higher redshift ( in damped lyman-  absorbers ) .",
    "higher spin temperatures close the agn , would lead to higher column densities in the associated absorbers and so those derived ( fig .",
    "[ 4-smooth ] , bottom left ) should be considered lower limits . for the covering factor",
    "we assume full coverage ( @xmath37 ) for the mean face - on ( @xmath38 ) disk , so that @xmath39 @xcite .    assuming that the gas remains sufficiently cool and neutral to exhibit detectable 21-cm absorption within the inner @xmath40  pc , where the kinematics are dominated by keplerian rotation around a massive compact object ( the central black hole )",
    ", this simple model does indeed suggest that additional high dispersion gas in the associated absorbers arises from a central component , rather than being dominated by orientation effects ( sect .",
    "[ sec : samp ] ) .    furthermore , the high column densities for the low inclination associated absorbers are consistent with what we expect from the milky way , in which the volume density of the neutral gas exhibits an exponential decrease with galactocentric radius according to @xmath41 , where @xmath42  and the scale - length @xmath43 kpc @xcite . from @xmath44 ,",
    "the column density has a maximum at @xmath45 , given by @xmath46 , which remains high to large radii , since this is the total volume density integrated over the path length .",
    "in addition to any possible differences in the intervening and associated profiles due to the presence of gas in close proximity to the agn , it is also possible that differences could be introduced by redshift evolution .",
    "unfortunately , the associated absorbers are predominantly at @xmath47 , due to higher redshifts preferentially selecting the most uv luminous sources ( sect .[intro ] ) . for the intervening absorbers ,",
    "however , the sample is split in half at @xmath4 , which , at a look - back time of lbt@xmath48  gyr , is close to half the age of the universe , which allows us to compare the profiles between these two epochs . from the distribution of profile width with redshift ( fig .",
    "[ int - z ] ) ,    we see no evidence of any evolution . if the thermal broadening is comparable to that introduced by the gas kinematics ( sect . [ rams ] ) , this would suggest no mean evolution in the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath49 .",
    "the intervening absorbers are not subject to the same broadening mechanisms as the associated absorbers , where gas kinematics , turbulence and radiative heating can be significant , leading to possible line broadening ( see fig .",
    "[ fwhm ] ) .",
    "that is , in thermodynamic equilibrium the spin temperature is coupled to the kinetic temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is given by @xmath50\\lapp 22 \\delta v^2 [ \\text{k for $ \\delta v$ in \\kms}],\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant . from the binned line - widths ( fig .",
    "[ int - z ] ) , we obtain @xmath53  k at lbts @xmath54 gyr and @xmath55  k at lbts @xmath56 gyr .",
    "the limit arises due to other possible broadening mechanisms , although the absence of any increase in profile width with redshift does not support the argument that there is an increase in temperature with redshift ( @xcite , where the @xmath57 assumption is used ) .",
    "this is consistent with the argument that the larger @xmath58 ratios measured at high redshift are dominated by lower covering factors @xcite , through the geometry effects of an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this study was to determine whether the absorber type can be predicted from the profile properties without _ a priori _ knowledge of the emission redshift from an optical spectrum .",
    "as seen in fig [ weight ] , however , the individual spectra are too varied to permit this , with the associated absorbers spanning the full range of line - widths ( fig . [ fwhm ] ) .",
    "we therefore apply machine learning techniques with the aim of building a classifier which can be used to make such a prediction . while the data set is quite limited , with @xmath59 useful spectra in each class , we can explore how feasible machine learning models are and the potential for prediction , particularly as more data are added .",
    "we use the weka package @xcite , a suite of machine learning algorithms designed for data mining tasks .",
    "a model is the result of the training data , the features selected to represent the data , the algorithm used , as well as a number of parameters set for the algorithm .",
    "a crucial step in machine learning is the selection of _",
    "features_. these represent each datum and therefore need to be discriminating and informative .",
    "the feature set forms the input given to the selected algorithm and it is the combination of the features which allow different algorithms to discriminate between classes .",

    "for example , for the confusion matrix @xmath64 , out of @xmath65 associated spectra the model correctly identifies 43 as associated and 12 erroneously as intervening and out of @xmath66 intervening spectra , 36 are correctly identified as intervening and 7 erroneously as associated .",
    "the data in the confusion matrices form the raw data used for reporting several evaluation measures  the precision , recall , f - measure and accuracy ( table [ models ] ) .",
    "those in table [ confusion ] show that the two classes are balanced in terms of training and classification .",
    "for instance , a matrix such as @xmath67 , would return a 90% accuracy , but in this case the model would have a 100% recognition rate for one class and 0% for the other .",
    "most of the models return a precision , recall , f - measure and accuracy of @xmath1% , making us optimistic that as more data are collected by the community , machine learning can provide a useful tool for classification of redshifted 21-cm absorption spectra .    during our feature selection experimentation",
    "we found that the accuracy of prediction is dominated by the profile width ",
    "models trained on the fwzi alone return accuracies just a few per - cent below those reported in table [ models ] .",
    "models trained on the three fwhm features give accuracies @xmath68% lower .",
    "the removal of all line - width information features , reduces the accuracy to @xmath69% , i.e. what we would obtain from chance .",
    "the number of components , @xmath70 , contributes relatively little to the prediction , which is surprising since we expect the associated profiles to be more complex .",
    "however , the combination of all features do provide the better performing models , in agreement with the attribute evaluator analysis ( table [ att ] ) .",
    "another feature we considered is @xmath61 .",
    "some experimentation with classifiers trained using the @xmath61 as an additional feature improved the precision in some cases ( e.g. up to 5.2% , from 78.5% to 83.7% for the sequential minimal optimisation algorithm , excluding the @xmath71 set ) , while being detrimental in others ( e.g. bayesian network ) .",
    "however , since the purpose of this work is to classify the absorber type without the use of an optical redshift , the pre - selection of which may introduce a bias ( sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , we did not consider @xmath61 in the final models ( table  [ models ] ) .",
    "the machine learning results are very encouraging and , as more data are added , we expect the predictive power of such classifiers to improve .",
    "this will prove invaluable as the number of new 21-cm detections becomes too large to feasibly follow - up with optical observations .",
    "forthcoming spectral lines surveys with the next generation of large radio telescopes are expected to detect large numbers of new redshifted  21-cm absorbers .",
    "although the measured redshifts of the absorbing galaxies will be extremely accurate , due to the phase - locking of radio receivers , without follow - up optical band observations it is generally not possible to determine whether the absorption arises within the source host or from a galaxy intervening the sight - line to a more distant radio source . given these large numbers , and the possibility that optical pre - selection biases against the detection of cool , neutral gas , it would be of great value to be able to determine the nature of the absorber based upon the radio data alone .",
    "to this end , we have compiled and digitised the known @xmath0  21-cm absorbers , converted these to consistent dimensions ( optical depth and velocity ) and re - sampled to a common spectral resolution .",
    "however , the normalised spectra in each of the associated and intervening classes exhibit a wide range of profile shapes , not making it possible to manually ascertain a typical profile shape . by applying machine learning algorithms",
    ", we find that , even for our limited sample of @xmath59 of each type of absorber , the type can be predicted with @xmath72 accuracy . as new detections are made , follow - up optical - band observations will allow us to improve the classifier in preparation for forthcoming  21-cm surveys with the ska and its precursors .",
    "although machine learning was invoked to classify the individual spectra , by averaging all those in each class in order to examine the bulk differences , we find :    1 .   that the mean associated profile is wider than the mean intervening profile , with a kolmogorov - smirnov of the individual widths giving a @xmath73 probability that the associated and intervening velocity distributions are drawn from the same population .",
    "this is consistent with the profile width being the one single feature which lowers the predictive power of the classifier to that of chance when removed .",
    "2 .   from a simple model of the  column density distribution , that the high velocity wings often observed in associated absorption , arise from the sub - pc gas , which appears to be absent in the intervening absorbers .",
    "this supports the widely proposed conjecture that the additional component of the associated absorption is due to the dense circumnuclear torus , invoked by unified schemes of agn .",
    "this is also consistent with hypothesis that associated absorption arises in agn ( radio galaxies and quasars ) , where significant amounts of gas are accreted onto the central super - massive black hole , whereas intervening absorption arises in more quiescent galaxies .",
    "the consistency in the mean intervening profile widths to either side of @xmath4 ( where the sample is split in half ) , indicates no kinematical or thermal evolution with redshift .",
    "while the  column density model is consistent with the bulk of profile broadening being kinematical , rather than thermal , in nature , this result does not support the proposed increase in the spin temperature of the gas with redshift in damped lyman-  absorbers .",
