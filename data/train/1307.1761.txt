    "in quantum dynamics , it is important to study whether a given bipartite quantum state is entangled , separable , quantum correlated , or classically correlated . until now many efforts has been taken in this region . as we know",
    ", quantum entanglement is a very useful physical resource in quantum information processing . in recent years",
    ", the quantification of entanglement has attracted much more attention [ 1 - 8 ] , in particular , entanglement of bipartite pure states and two - qubit mixed states has been obtained good understanding [ 1 - 5,8 ] . however , quantum entanglement is not the only quantum correlation in quantum dynamics .",
    "quantum discord [ 9,10 ] , first introduced by ollivier and zurek [ 10 ] , can effectively capture the quantum correlation of quantum system .",
    "it has been shown that quantum discord can lead to a speedup in some quantum information tasks [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "it is especially worth noting that quantum discord is not consistent with quantum entanglement in general cases [ 15 ] .",
    "quantum discord captures quantum correlation even more general than entanglement .",
    "specially separable mixed states , which have no entanglement , have proven to include nonzero quantum discord .",
    "quantum discord is not always larger than quantum entanglement .",
    "however , most interests of quantifying entanglement and quantum discord are focused in a pure mathematical frame [ 16,17,18 ] .",
    "for example , since quantum entanglement is not an observable in the strict quantum mechanical frame , no directly measurable observable has been found until now , to describe the entanglement of a given arbitrary quantum state , owing to the unphysical quantum operations in the usual entanglement measure , such as the complex conjugation of concurrence [ 2 ] and the partial transpose of negativity [ 1 ] . in recent years",
    ", some interesting methods have been proposed to construct direct observables related to entanglement [ 19 - 22 ] , which can be used to precisely measure the entanglement in contrast to entanglement witness [ 23 ] and have less observables compared with quantum state tomography [ 24,25 ] .",
    "however , they require the simultaneous multiple copies of given quantum states , which brings new difficulties to the experiment .",
    "quantum discord as a measure of quantum correlation can only be analytically calculated for some special states [ 15,16 ] , unless the invariational definition of quantum discord is considered [ 26 ] .",
    "the key difficulty lies in the analytical calculation of the classical correlation , since quantum discord is defined as the difference between the total correlation ( i.e. quantum mutual information ) and the classical correlation [ 9,10 ] .",
    "although the dynamical behavior and some operational understanding of quantum discord in quantum state evolution has attracted increasing interests recently [ 27 - 29 ] , there still exist an open question how one can construct several directly measurable observables related to quantum discord .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to probe the entanglement , discord , and the classical correlation of a type of one - parameter bipartite quantum states based on the cavity qed [ 30 - 33 ] .",
    "although the entanglement of one - parameter quantum state such as werner state [ 34 ] , isotropic state and so on [ 35,36 ] can be measured based on simple von neumann measurements without the requirement of simultaneous copies of the state , these measurements usually cover projections on two qubits .",
    "however , our measurement is only performed on the probe qubit .",
    "in addition , the distinguished advantage of our scheme is that one can probe quantum entanglement , quantum discord and the classical correlation by introducing a probe qubit to interact with the measured systems , but the entanglement , the discord and the classical correlation of the system are not disturbed . in particular , in some cases , one can even realize the non - demolition measurement of the quantum state [ 37,38 ] . that is to say ,",
    "we can probe the quantum information of the quantum state , but the state is not disturbed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a scheme to probe the quantum entanglement , the quantum discord and the classical correlation , but they are not disturbed in the probe procedure . in sec .",
    "iii , we give our another model to demonstrate the non - demolition measurement of our given quantum state .",
    "the conclusion is drawn finally .",
    "suppose two qubits are prepared in the unknown one - parameter quantum state@xmath0where @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we introduce a third qubit as a probe qubit to interact with the two given qubit in @xmath2 .",
    "it will be shown that one can read the entanglement , the quantum correlation and the classical correlation of @xmath2 by measuring the third qubit , but the entanglement , quantum correlation and the classical correlation after the interaction are not disturbed .",
    "now we will discuss our scheme in the frame of cavity qed .",
    "our system includes one two - level atom labeled by c surrounded by two identical optical cavities labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath4see fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . we suppose the initial state of the two cavity modes is @xmath2 that will be detected and the atom c serves as the probe qubit with an excited state @xmath5 and a ground state @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the joint system is given by ( setting @xmath7 ) @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequencies of the atomic transition and the cavity modes respectively ; @xmath11 is the coupling constant of the atom and cavity mode and the @xmath12 is for the calculatable convenience ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the raising and lowering operators of the atom ; @xmath15 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath16th cavity .    under the resonant case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath17 , one can obtain the hamiltonian in the interaction picture as , @xmath18.\\]]if the initial state of atom c is prepared in @xmath6 , the evolution of the joint system of the two cavities and the atom can be given by@xmath19after a simple calculation , one can find that @xmath20and @xmath21 next , we will employ wootters concurrence [ 2 ] as entanglement measure , the quantum discord [ 9,10 ] as the measure of quantum correlation to discuss their invariability after our detection .",
    "concurrence of a bipartite quantum state @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23where the @xmath24 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath25 with @xmath26 in decreasing order .",

    "however , when in the realistic scenario , one has to select @xmath41 , by which one can reduce the time of interaction of the whole system with the unavoidable noise .",
    "next , we will show that the quantum and the classical correlations can not be disturbed by our detection .",
    "quantum discord is used to measure the quantum correlation between two subsystems . for a bipartite quantum system @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) denoting the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "then the quantum discord between subsystems @xmath47 and @xmath46 can be defined as follows @xmath48where @xmath49is the quantum mutual information and @xmath50 is the classical correlation between the two subsystems . in particular , the classical correlation is given by @xmath51,\\]]where @xmath52 is a set of von neumann measurements performed on subsystem @xmath46 locally , @xmath53 is the quantum conditional entropy , @xmath54 is the conditional density operator corresponding to the outcome labeled by @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . here",

    "in particular , one can also find that the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath70 is the exchange of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "so we want to emphasize here that our detection has no influence on the concurrence , the quantum discord and the classical correlation of the system . from the viewpoint of noise",

    "we set @xmath84 . from the figure",
    ", one can find that the spontaneous emission has slight influence on the entanglement and correlation of @xmath2 as well as our detection .",
    "in particular , the quantum discord of the original state is influenced more slightly by the small @xmath78 .",

    "in fact , in a different framework , one can realize the non - demolition measurement of the quantum state . in this case , we consider two identical two - level atoms a and b which are trapped in an optical cavity , respectively . in particular , the two cavities are arranged to be crossed as is sketched in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "we will introduce a third atom c as a probe qubit .",
    "one can find that the measurement on the qubit c can reveal the information of the quantum state of the joint system ` a+b ' without disturbing it .",

    "we also analyze how the spontaneous emission of our probe qubit influences our detection , which shows that small spontaneous emission rate of the probe atom has slight influence on the detection .",
