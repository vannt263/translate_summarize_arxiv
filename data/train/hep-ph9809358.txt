    "for various theoretical and phenomenological reasons various extensions of the sm have been introduced .",
    "the simplest such extension is two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) where one extends the scalar sector of the sm by adding a second doublet without modifying the gauge structure @xcite .",
    "such models are mainly motivated by mssm @xcite in which one has to introduce at least two higgs doublets .",
    "one basic use of the 2hdm s is that one is able to create the necessary mass splitting between the up- and down - type quarks @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "various high energy processes have been discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the famous sakharov conditions @xcite for creating the baryon aymmetry in the universe can not be satified in sm due to the smallness of the cp - violation . in 2hdm , however , explicit or spontaneous breaking of cp is allowed with the self interactions of the higgs doublets @xcite .",
    "mssm has two higgs doublets and its higgs sector mimics that of the 2hdm in many respects , except for the fact that supersymmetry fixes various parameters in terms of the gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "however , mssm has an hierarchy problem , namely , the scale of the supersymmetric mass term @xmath1 is not known .    in this work",
    ", we work out supersymmetric models with an additional @xmath0 which are known to solve the mssm @xmath1 problem @xcite . indeed ,",
    "as was already argued in @xcite , in a large class of string models , breaking scale of the extra @xmath0 s come out to be around a tev .",
    "whatever the planck scale consideration ( susy gut s or superstrings ) from which these models follow , to be able to get a sensible solution to the problems mentioned above it is necessary to keep supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry exact till the tev scale .",
    "when the susy is broken around the tev scale one gets @xmath2(tev ) so that the @xmath1-problem is avoided .",
    "the possible existence of a supersymmetric abelian gauge factor which is broken at the tev scale together with the supersymmetry affects the weak scale observables through the non - decoupling effects in the higgs sector @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the higgs sector of an abelian extended susy model ( we call this @xmath3 model from now on ) such that after the breaking of the extra supersymmetric @xmath0 factor there arises an effective 2hdm at the weak scale .",
    "this problem has already been worked out in @xcite where various phenomenological implications of non - decoupling effects in the higgs sector were discussed . however , in this work we present a detailed analysis of the tree level constraints on the scalar potential of a general @xmath3 model to be able to get a 2hdm below the tev scale .    in sec .",
    "2 we first discuss the reduction of the scalar potential of a general @xmath3 model to a 2hdm potential below the tev scale .",
    "next , we identify the appropriate portions of the @xmath3 model parameter space to make this reduction process viable .    in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the properties of the resulting 2hdm potential in connection with several phenomenological issues .    in sec .",
    "4 we conclude the work .",
    "in @xmath3 models , the mssm gauge group is extended to @xmath4 with the coupling constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , respectively . under @xmath9 ,",
    "the higgs superfields are assigned the quantum numbers @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is an sm gauge singlet whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) breaks the extra @xmath0 .",
    "part of the superpotential containing exclusively the higgs fields is given by @xmath14 in addition to this , the complete superpotential contains fermion trilinear mass terms .",
    "we discard such terms from the analysis because whenever the sfermions develop non - vanishing vev s color and/or charge symmetries are broken .",
    "as long as the parameter spaces we work in do not imply non - vanishing sfermion vev s , analysis of the higgs dependent part of the potential suffices .",
    "we further note that due to the @xmath15 symmetry a bare @xmath1 term is forbidden ; thus form of the superpotential in ( 1 ) is unique .",
    "the full scalar potential in the @xmath3 models is given by @xmath16 where we discarded the hat on the superfields to denote their scalar components . in ( 2 ) ,",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the soft mass - squareds of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the higgs trilinear cupling . while these quantities of mass dimension come from the soft supersymmetry breaking part of the potential , those terms involving the adimensional parameters @xmath24 come from the supersymmetric part of the lagrangian consisting of @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .    in this work",
    ", we shall not investigate the cp - violating or charge breaking properties of the vacuum state so we allow only the cp - even components of the higgs fields to develop non - vanishing vev s .",
    "thus , vev s of the higgs fields in ( 2 ) are subjected to the following parametrization @xmath29 with real @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore by appropriate choice of the signs of the potential parameters they can always be taken positive @xcite .    to be able to obtain an effective 2hdm below the tev - scale , one should realize @xmath32(tev ) and @xmath33 so that below the tev scale sm- gauge group remains unbroken . before an attempt to determine the portion of the parameter space for which ony @xmath34 is broken , let us assume such a splitting between the sm - singlet and the doublet vev s indeed exist and derive the effective 2hdm potential below the tev - scale .",
    "for convenience we apply the parametrization @xmath35 when @xmath31 is non - zero , @xmath15 symmetry is broken and @xmath36 becomes a massive cp - even scalar with mass - squared @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 , on the other hand , becomes the pseudoscalar goldstone boson to be swallowed by the gauge boson of @xmath15 , @xmath3 , to acquire a mass . inserting the parametrization of @xmath22 in ( 5 ) into the scalar potential ( 2 )",
    ", one reads off the feynman rules relating the three higgs fields : @xmath39 where @xmath40 . with the help of these feynman rules one obtains the tree level diagrams representing the scattering processes @xmath41 ( i , j , k , l = 1 , 2 ) mediated by @xmath42 .",
    "we shall not reproduce these diagrams here as they are similar to ones given in @xcite . for external momenta",
    "much smaller than @xmath43 , the scattering amplitudes mentioned above merely result in modification of the original quartic couplings of the higgs doublets producing the effective 2hdm quartic parameters . in addition to these quartic coupings , the mass - squareds of the higgs doublets do also change as can be seen throough the replacement of the parametrization in ( 5 ) into the quadratic terms in the potential ( 2 ) . defining ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 , the 2hdm potential below @xmath31 reads as follows : @xmath46 where the new parameters here can be expressed in terms of those of the underlying @xmath3 model as follows : @xmath47 in obtaining these parameters we have used only tree level diagrams , a more sophisticated derivation of which would include at least the one - loop effects contributed by the suprsymmetric particle spectrum of the @xmath3 model .",
    "however , we neglect all such loop contributions by assuming that these tree level results give the most important part of the information we need .",
    "in fact , for large enough soft masses ( above tev scale ) one expects susy spectrum to have negligable effects at the weak scale .",
    "the reduction of the scalar potential ( 2 ) to the 2hdm potential rests on the assumption of an ordered breaking of the gauge symmetry , that is , only @xmath15 symmetry is broken above the tev scale while the sm - gauge gauge symmetry survives down to the weak scale at which it is broken in the usual way to reproduce the phenomenologically well - established electroweak data .",
    "this two - stage breaking of the gauge symmetry necessiates @xmath31 , the susy breaking scale , be given by @xmath48 while doublets still have vanishing vev s . with this expression for @xmath49 , the higgs boson @xmath36 and the @xmath3 boson can be shown to have identical masses @xmath50 which has a meaning only when @xmath51 .",
    "obtaining the pattern of vev s @xmath52 and @xmath53 requires a certain hierarchy between @xmath19 and the other mass parameters pertaining the higgs doublets , that is , doublet soft mass - squareds and the higgs trilinear coupling .",
    "we now turn to a detailed discussion of the constraints imposed on the parameters of the potential coming from the two - stage breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "our aim is to set limits on the doublet soft mass - squareds and the higgs trilinear coupling for a given @xmath19 such that sm gauge symmetry remains unbroken at the tev scale . for the sake of clarity it seems convenient to discuss the effects of these two mass scales seperately .",
    "hence , we first turn off @xmath23 and investigate the ranges of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . next we shall turn to the discussion of @xmath23 .",
    "after setting @xmath54 , all of the vev s can be solved analytically by requiring the potential ( 2 ) to have vanishing gradients in all directions in the higgs background .",
    "in addition to the solution @xmath55 characterizing the symmetric phase , we have for the broken phase @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a common factor for all three vev s . from ( 9 )",
    "it is easy to find the critical values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at which @xmath58 and @xmath59 vanishes : @xmath60 since @xmath61 change sign at these critical points they seperate two kinds of minima ; while in one of which all vev s in ( 11 ) are non - vanishing ( that is , symmetry is completely broken ) and in the other one only @xmath15 is broken ( that is , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . since @xmath62 must be negative for ( 10 )",
    "be meaningful , the sign of the critical masses in ( 12 ) depends on the signs of @xmath63 defined in ( 3 ) .",
    "this requires the knowledge of @xmath64 , @xmath8 and the @xmath15 charges , which would be possible only in a specific string or susy - gut model .",
    "in addition to this observation , one expects higgs doublets to have vanishing vev s when the absolute values of the doublet soft mass - squareds become much smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "this last observation enables one to impose certain conditions on the higgs vev s ( 11 ) , namely , the coefficients of @xmath19 must be @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 so that , for large enough @xmath65 , doublet vev s obtained from ( 11 ) will be imaginary . using the explicit expressions of @xmath24 in ( 3 ) , coefficients of @xmath19 in ( 11 )",
    "can be shown to depend on three free parameters ; @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the requirements about the coefficients of @xmath19 in ( 11 )",
    "produce a certain constraint on these free parameters .",
    "in fact , in fig . 1 , depicted",
    "is the allowed region in the @xmath72 plane for which the coefficients of @xmath19 in ( 11 ) take the required values mentioned above . when drawing this graph @xmath73 is absorbed into @xmath8 , and @xmath71 is set to unity .",
    "one recalls that , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 as is seen from ( 3 ) .",
    "although we consider a specific choice for @xmath71 here , with general formulae for vev s in ( 11 ) , one can investigate other possibilities for @xmath71 as well .",
    "in forming fig.1 we let @xmath77 and @xmath70 vary from 0.5 to 1.5 which is a symmetric interval around unity .",
    "we see that in this interval allowed @xmath70 values increase in approximate proportion with the allowed @xmath77 values .",
    "now we turn to the main question of how large doublet soft mass - squareds , in comparison with @xmath19 , can be to have sm gauge symmtery unbroken at the tev scale .",
    "we illustrate the ranges of the doublet soft mass - squareds with the help of the information provided by fig .",
    "1 . out of all",
    "the candidate points shown in fig .",
    "1 we take the one for which @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this choice is in agreement with the usual prescriptions about the low - energy @xmath3 models , that is @xmath80 @xcite and @xmath81 @xcite . as metioned before , for @xmath74 used in forming fig . 1 , @xmath76 for which the critical values of the doublet soft mass - squareds in ( 12 ) are equal . as the critical points are identical , for simplicity of the illustration , we take @xmath82 and show the @xmath83 dependence of the squared vev s ( 11 ) in units of @xmath84 , in fig .",
    "2 . as is seen from this figure , @xmath67 ( solid line ) increases monotonically with increasing @xmath83 , never going through zero .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) , however , remain identical and drop below zero at approximately @xmath85 as exactly predicted by the critical points in ( 12 ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "2 can be concluded by saying that sm gauge symmetry remains unbroken as long as @xmath86 provided the parameter set used for fig . 1 and @xmath87 are assumed .",
    "the more general case of @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be analyzed in a similar way by using the expressions of vev s in ( 11 ) , and the critical points in ( 12 ) . in this case",
    "there will be more free variables ( @xmath90 ) and their behaviour will be complicated for graphical presentation . despite this , when the coefficient of @xmath19 is @xmath68 for doublet vev s and @xmath66 for sm -singlet vev , and when the doublet mass - squareds exceed their respective critical points given in ( 12 ) , one has a minimum of the potential for which sm gaue symmetry remains unbroken at the scale @xmath91(tev ) .",
    "this last statement summarizes the results about the minimum of the potential leading to a 2hdm at the weak scale when the higgs trilinear coupling mass parameter @xmath23 is much smaller than the quadratic mass parameters of the higgs doublets .",
    "the basic property of the higgs trilinear coupling @xmath23 is that it forces all fields @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to have identical vev s , depending on its strength compared to the other mass parameters in the potential @xcite .",
    "this happens especially when all mass - squareds are of the same order and much smaller than @xmath92 , and type of the transition from the symmetric to the broken minimum depends the sign of the sum @xmath93 .",
    "the critical point at which the transition occurs is @xmath94 , and for positive ( negative ) @xmath95 passage to the broken mininum is a first ( second ) order phase transition @xcite . in the present case , where @xmath65 is much larger than all other mass parameters in the potential ( 2 ) ,",
    "one is to analyze the doublet vev s @xmath96 for a given @xmath31 to find the critical value of @xmath23 at which the transition from sm- symmetric minimum to sm - broken minimum occurs .",
    "this requires the solution of the minimization equations for the potential ( 2 ) in @xmath96 direction .",
    "here one faces with two coupled third order algebraic equations the analytic solution of which is hard to construct , and even if constructed , the results will not be transparent .",
    "thus , we consider now a special but an important limit , that is , @xmath97 , which can easily be obtained for certain set of parameters as illustrated in the last section . in this case",
    "it is not hard to determine the critical point @xmath98 at which the transtion to an sm- broken phase occurs : @xmath99 where @xmath31 is given by ( 9 ) .",
    "an inspection on this equation reveals that @xmath98 is large ( small ) when @xmath100 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "moreover , when @xmath101 is small @xmath98 is mainly determined by @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the construction of @xmath98 from the minimization conditions reveals that transition is always second order .",
    "we now illustrate the range of @xmath23 for two distinct choices for the doublet soft mass - squareds . in fig .",
    "3 , depicted are the @xmath102 dependence of @xmath103 ( solid curve ) and @xmath104 ( dashed curve ) for @xmath105 , and other parameters are the same as ones used for fig .",
    "the choice of @xmath19 is arbitrary and sufficient as long as it is large negative compared to other parameters of mass dimension . as is seen from fig .",
    "3 , the higgs doublets have vanishing vev s until @xmath23 reaches the transition point @xmath106",
    ". meanwhile @xmath31 remains to have the value given by ( 9 ) .",
    "the critical point is exactly the one predicted by ( 13 ) . to see the dependence of @xmath98 in ( 13 ) on the doublet mass parameters we now illustrate the case of @xmath105 and @xmath107 with other parameters being as in fig .",
    "1 . in this case , as is seen from fig .",
    "4 , critical point is large , @xmath108 , and situated at the point predicted by ( 13 ) .    in the light of the above observations , we conclude that when the higgs trilinear coupling @xmath23 is below a certain critical value @xmath98 the higgs doublets have vanishing vev s .",
    "this critical point depends on the doublet soft mass - squareds and @xmath31 . when the parameters of the potential allow for @xmath97 , the critical value of @xmath23 has the expression given in ( 13 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive , the higgs doublets are unable to develop vev s with the help of their masses , leaving @xmath23 as the only remedy .",
    "this requires @xmath23 to be large enough ( @xmath109 ) to help all fields acquire asymptotically nearly equal vev s as is clearly seen from fig .",
    "3 and fig .",
    "in the last section we obtained an effective 2hdm potential after breaking the extra @xmath0 at the tev scale . equation",
    "( 7 ) represents the most general 2hdm potential with the parameters in ( 8) .",
    "we now discuss some important prioperties of ( 7 ) .",
    "* there are three parameters of mass dimension in ( 7 ) : @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 each of which has its own characteristic minimum . as it is convenient to discuss their effects seperately , let us first consider the case of @xmath113 .",
    "needless to say this case corresponds to the small trilinear coupling regime of the potential ( 2 ) , discussed in sec .",
    "2.1 . in this case",
    "the neutral componenet of the higgs doublet @xmath114 develops a vev @xmath115 where the mixed quartic terms are neglected .",
    "clearly , if @xmath116 , vev becomes imaginary and potential prefers the symmetric minimum ; @xmath117 .",
    "there are two ways of making @xmath118 negative .",
    "first , the soft mass @xmath17 can be negative .",
    "second @xmath119 can be negative depending on the relative magnitudes of its d - term and f - term components , as listed in ( 3 ) .",
    "2 , which is obtained for a special set of parameters , shows a typical case applicable when @xmath120 is small .",
    "when soft masses of the higgs doublets are negative , as is necessary to have @xmath121 , one can vary @xmath122 up to @xmath123 , in accordance with ( 12 ) and fig .",
    "on the other hand , the case of negative @xmath119 can be obtained when @xmath124 is larger than @xmath125 .",
    "this latter alterative should be taken with care because perturbative nature of the model at the tev scale can be disturbed .",
    "of course , having at least one of @xmath110 and @xmath111 is sufficient , thanks to the mixed quartic couplings in ( 7 ) , one can make both vev s non zero . if @xmath126 one gets a large @xmath127 minimum because @xmath128 will be much smaller than @xmath129 . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath130 one has a small @xmath127 by the similar arguments . while in former case the huge @xmath131 ratio can be obtained for nearly equal top ( @xmath132 ) and bottom ( @xmath133 ) yukawa couplings , in the latter case one would need @xmath134 .",
    "finally , @xmath135 implies @xmath136 when both mass - squareds are negative , and in this case @xmath137 is sufficient .",
    "+ when @xmath138 , @xmath112 makes up almost a unique mass scale for the potential .",
    "then @xmath139 and consequently @xmath136 for which @xmath137 as mentioned above .",
    "this large @xmath120 case correspond to the large @xmath23 regime analyzed in sec .",
    ". + these naive tree level considerations are not valid when the loop effects on the parameters of the potential ( 7 ) are taken into account .",
    "the largest of such corrections come to the quartic coupling of @xmath140 , @xmath141 due to large @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this change in @xmath141 directly affects @xmath142 wherby modifying the value of @xmath127 .",
    "however , in the large @xmath120 regime one does not expect too big changes , as long as it still dominates over the quadratic mass parameters . * depending on the way @xmath15 is broken , the various operators in the 2hdm potential ( 7 ) get suppressed or amplified , as are seen from ( 8) .",
    "when @xmath23 is vanishingly small , as discussed in sec .",
    "2.1 , @xmath143 becomes negligable and @xmath144 approaches @xmath145 .",
    "in addition , the quadractic mass parameters @xmath122 approach to the corresponding soft mass - squareds in ( 2 ) . finally , the higgs mixing",
    "mass @xmath112 becomes negligably small in this limit .",
    "+ when @xmath23 is the dominant mass parameter , as analyzed in sec .",
    "2.2 , one has @xmath146 .",
    "unlike the previous case , here @xmath143 and @xmath112 are no way negligable .",
    "+ finally , it is worthy of noting that the values of @xmath147 , @xmath141 and @xmath148 is independent of the way @xmath15 symmetry is broken .",
    "this is because @xmath149 in both cases .",
    "* throughout the discussions in the last section all parameters of the potential ( 2 ) have been assumed real .",
    "in addition to this , the higgs fields were assigned real eigenvalues .",
    "if the higgs trilinear coupling @xmath23 in the potential ( 2 ) were complex so are @xmath150 and @xmath112 in ( 7 ) . after writing the relevant parts of the potential ( 7 ) appropriately",
    ", one observes that under a cp transformation @xmath151 , @xmath150 and @xmath112 dependent terms do not transform trivially .",
    "however , since @xmath152 , cp- invariance of the potential is guaranteed @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are strong experimental limits , though in mssm , forcing @xmath112 to be nearly real @xcite .",
    "thus , the resulting 2hdm potential ( 7 ) does not support the explicit violation of cp . as is seen from ( 8) , @xmath153 , so that the 2hdm potential ( 7 ) can not accomodate spontaneous cp violation too @xcite .",
    "thus , the resulting 2hdm does break cp neither explicitely nor spontaneously .",
    "* as has already been discussed in @xcite , the parameters of the @xmath3 model ( 2 ) can be connected to the unification level ( strings or gut s ) initial conditions via the rge s . in this sense , better the determinations at low - energies , better the knowledge one has about unification level parameters .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to constrain the parameters of the 2hdm potential ( 7 ) using the low energy data as much as possible .",
    "for example , the precisely measured z - pole observables can be used to constrain these parameters @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have presented the reduction of a supersymmetric tev - scale extra @xmath0 to an effective 2hdm at the weak scale .",
    "we have identified the appropriate portions of the parameter space of the extra @xmath0 model for obtaining a 2hdm below the tev scale .",
    "moreover , properties of the resulting 2hdm is connected to the mechanism of extra @xmath0 breaking .",
    "in addition to these , we have discussed various properties of this 2hdm in connection with weak scale phenomenology , @xmath154- pole data and cp -violation .",
    "other than these @xmath3 models , reduction of nmssm to an effective 2hdm can also be worked out . in spite of the cosmological problems due to the broken @xmath155 symmetry @xcite , from the particle physics point of view such models can provide us with an effective 2hdm at the weak scale , when the sm - singlet picks up a vev around a tev . in this case ,",
    "mass of the pseudoscalar boson breaking the unwanted peccei - quinn symmetry will be an important constraint .",
    "whatever the tev scale model we start with , the weak scale 2hdm can constrain the parameter space of the original model through the experimental data .",
