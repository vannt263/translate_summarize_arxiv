    "indeed , these old pulsating horizontal - branch stars have long been used as fundamental distance probes , shedding flickering light on the history of the galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "even if the `` uniqueness '' of the milky way is often viewed as both virtue and vice , its place as a laboratory to study the structure formation in the low - mass regime is not contested . only here , at home , the fine details of the hierarchical processes driven by the gravitational forces of the large - scale distribution of cold dark matter can be scrutinized with ample resolution and rigor ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lives of the accreted dwarfs are always severely affected .",
    "even if some of them survive , their gas is stripped and as a result their star - formation hindered or altogether put out .",
    "recently , such cinders of ancient star - formation have been uncovered within the galactic halo in large numbers @xcite . while it is still not possible to compare directly the properties of the observed and the simulated dwarf satellites , it appears that the number of puzzling discrepancies is slowly growing ( see e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is predicted that if the galactic tides are strong enough , the infalling dwarf satellites are pulled apart leaving trails of stars that can be recognized as coherent overdensities in the halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "curiously , the few studies that do attempt to gauge the lumpiness of the milky way stellar halo in both real and mock datasets , tend to conclude that the galaxy is somewhat smoother than predicted ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this might simply be because the total stellar mass in the myriad of the recently discovered sub - structures is relatively small .",
    "such estimates of the halo lumpiness rely of course on the knowledge of the global properties of the stellar halo , including its integrated luminosity and overall extent .",
    "these , however , are poorly determined , as large portions of the galaxy remain unexplored : the most obvious lacunae being the low - latitude inner portions of the halo as well as large swathes of the southern sky .",
    "the catalina sky survey has collected multi - epoch imaging data from three different observing sites , covering most of the accessible sky , namely the area from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the survey s results in the northern hemisphere have been presented recently @xcite . here , we analyse data from the southern hemisphere segment of catalina , the siding spring survey ( sss ) .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to fill in the obvious gap in the south , and discover and characterize ab- type rr lyrae stars with @xmath13 .",
    "rr lyrae stars , and in particular those of the ab - type ( rrab ) , have long been known as a trusted tracer of the galactic halo .",
    "the rrab s are relatively easy to differentiate from other types of variable stars due to the characteristic asymmetric shape of the lightcurve .",
    "we , therefore , concentrate solely on rrab s which allows us to assemble a comparatively clean sample of stars over @xmath14 square degrees . as a result , when combined with the previously published catalina sky survey catalogues , our total rr lyrae sample covers more than @xmath15 square degrees and reaches distances in excess of 50 kpc .",
    "thanks to the immense , un - interrupted spatial extent of our survey , we can , for the first time , build a global inventory of the halo sub - structures .",
    "most importantly , it is now possible to quantify large - scale asymmetries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if any are indeed present .",
    "recently , several bloated halo structures covering hundreds of square degrees have been identified in the northern sky , including the hercules - aquila cloud ( hac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and virgo overdensity ( vod ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in their morphology , these stellar `` clouds '' are distinct from narrow tidal tails or `` streams '' , and were likely produced as a result of nearly radial in - fall of relatively massive galaxies , but their exact origin is still unknown . with the data from one half of the sky missing",

    "finally , we also hope to leverage thousands of precise distances across the southern sky to understand better the most prominent un - relaxed structure in the outer galaxy , the sagittarius stream .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite and its associated tidal tails ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the sgr stream is so long that its wraps overlap in many locations on the sky thus confusing the interpretation .",
    "our data possesses the necessary accuracy to resolve the sub - structure along the line of sight , therefore helping to untangle sgr s intertwined tidal tails .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to automate the rr lyrae catalog production .",
    "therefore , we start by introducing the survey data in section  [ sec : odc ] and then go on to describe the algorithms designed to find and classify the rrab in section  [ sec : selection ] . in section  [ ssesc : class ]",

    "finally , the properties of the discovered rrab stars are presented in section  [ ssec : res ] .",
    "in this paper we analyze 18,288 periodic variable candidates found in the sss , the southern part of the catalina sky survey .",
    "the catalina sky survey began in 2004 and utilized three telescopes at three different observing sites to cover the sky between declination @xmath16 .",
    "acquiring images of the sky across more than 33,000 square degrees , the principal aim of the catalina sky survey was to discover near - earth objects ( neos ) and potential hazardous asteroids ( phas ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "its counterpart , the catalina real- time transient survey ( crts ) , involves the analysis of the same data in order to detect and classify stationary optical transients @xcite .",
    "both surveys work collaboratively to extract the maximum scientific return from the data of the three telescopes operated by the catalina sky surveys . these consist of the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) telescope , the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) telescope , and the sss telescope in siding spring , australia .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a 4k@xmath174k ccd camera , with the field of view of 8.2 , 1.1 and 4 square degrees for the css , mls and sss , respectively .",
    "the focus of this work , the sss uses the uppsala 0.5-m schmidt telescope equipped with a ccd camera nearly identical to the one used by its northern counterpart , the css , which is an obvious advantage in terms of homogeneity of the resulting photometry .",
    "the pixel size is 2 arc minutes giving a field of view of 4 square degrees . in the sss observations , the galactic plane region ( @xmath18 )",
    "is avoided due to crowding .",
    "images are unfiltered to maximize throughput , and taken in sequences of four observations separated by ten minutes with exposures that last approximately 30 seconds .",
    "sextractor @xcite is employed to obtain photometry of individual objects in an automated fashion .",
    "the initial selection of variable objects and the subsequent photometric transformations are all part of the general catalina pipeline and are identical to those described in @xcite , and therefore are only briefly summarized here .",
    "first , variable source candidates were identified from the sss data using the welch - stetson variability index @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "then , for all objects in the list of potential variables , the lomb - scargle period finding method @xcite was applied and periodic variable candidates with periods between 0.1 and 4 days were selected .",
    "these boundaries are chosen to be broader than the expected range of periods for rrab stars ( @xmath20  days ) to make sure that we also recover rrab stars affected by aliasing in the lomb - scargle analysis .",
    "the sample of periodic variables consists of @xmath21 objects with unfiltered magnitudes between 10.5 and 19.2 and @xmath22 epochs each .",
    "figure [ fig : fig01 ] shows locations of all candidate periodic objects in equatorial coordinates , to give an idea of the spatial extent of the sample .",
    "since the ccd used by the sss matches closely the one used by the css ( implying , of course , that the responses are nearly identical ) , we can apply the calibration equations implemented by the css to transform between the unfiltered catalina sss data and the standard johnson @xmath23 filter .",
    "this is given in equation 1 of @xcite :    @xmath24    this relation has a dispersion of @xmath25 mag .",
    "since in this work we focus on rrab stars , we investigate the impact of color variations on the recovered properties of these variables .",
    "if we consider an average color for rrab stars of @xmath26 mag and the possible color range of @xmath27 @xcite , the maximum difference in color is @xmath28 mag in @xmath29 .",
    "this adds an extra uncertainty of @xmath30 mag to eq .",
    "[ eq : intro1 ] , which combined in quadrature with the dispersion of the relation gives a total dispersion of 0.077 mag in the @xmath23 magnitude .",
    "however , because rrab s change color during their pulsation cycle , taking the average color might cause measurable effects to the lightcurve shape , which in turn could lead to a bias in the estimation of the metallicity and the average magnitude of the star .",
    "we tested these effects by making a simple model of the rrab color change as a function of the lightcurve phase , following the typical color variations of the rrab during their pulsation cycles as seen in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "we used this model to transform the @xmath31 mag to @xmath23 mag as a function of phase and estimate the metallicity and the average magnitude .",
    "we then compared these quantities with the one obtained by taking a constant value of @xmath32 mag , and found that the differences have a dispersion of @xmath33 dex for the metallicity and @xmath34 mag for the average magnitude .",
    "these values are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical uncertainty induced by photometric error .",
    "since we lack the color information in the sss data , and given that the effects of the color variation over the pulsation cycle are small , we believe that we are justified in using an average color of @xmath32 mag to transform between @xmath31 and johnson @xmath23 .",
    "efficient detection of rrab in a dataset like sss is possible solely thanks to their characteristic lightcurve shapes .",
    "however , the asymmetry in the rrab pulses only reveals itself if the lightcurve is phased ( folded ) with the correct period .",
    "moreover , the metallicity and the intrinsic luminosity of such a variable star both require accurate lightcurve morphology measurements . getting the period",
    "right is therefore absolutely crucial for both the identification of rr lyrae as well as the subsequent inference of their properties .",
    "we tackle the problem of automating the rr lyrae discovery and characterization by developing two routines , the automatic fourier decomposition ( afd ) , which builds robust lightcurve models , and the automatic period selection ( aps ) , which makes use of different periodograms to home in on the correct period . with these tools in hand ,",
    "the process of the classifying variables based on the shapes of their lightcurves is fast , robust and reproducible . in sections [ ssec :",
    "afd ] and [ ssec : aps ] the two routines are introduced and discussed in detail .",
    "the essence of the afd method is that the complexity of the lightcurve model is dictated by the data s signal - to - noise ratio as well as the details of the lightcurve morphology . in other words ,",
    "the number of harmonics in the fourier decomposition of a phased lightcurve is increased as long as the fit continues to be statistically significant . to find the parameters of the harmonics in the fourier decomposition we carry out a weighted least - squares fitting procedure where the model lightcurve is described by :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 are the amplitudes , @xmath37 the phases , @xmath38 the period and @xmath39 the number of harmonics in the decomposition . to determine the value of @xmath39",
    ", we perform several fits with increasing number of harmonics until it is not statistically significant to add an extra harmonic .",
    "the process starts with just one harmonic :    @xmath40    we perform a least - squares fit to determine @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , and quantify the goodness of the fit through the reduced @xmath44 statistic , calculated as follows :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the number of observations , @xmath47 the number of parameters of the fourier decomposition , @xmath48 the error of the observation , @xmath49 the observed value , and @xmath50 the expected value as given by the fourier series .",
    "we then compare the quality of this fit to a fourier decomposition with one extra harmonic and with two extra harmonics . to determine if the series with extra harmonics gives us a significant improvement on the quality of the fit , we perform a statistical f - test to check if the null hypothesis ( i.e. , the two fits are statistically equal in terms of their performance ) can be discarded .",
    "the @xmath51 statistic is calculated as follows :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the number of degrees of freedom of the second fit , and @xmath54 is the difference in the number of parameters @xmath55 between the second and the first fit ( note that @xmath56 always ) . the test statistic",
    "is then compared to a critical value , @xmath57 ; if @xmath51 is less than the critical value , the null hypothesis can not be discarded and the two models are statistically equal in their ability to describe the observed data . to determine @xmath57 , we require that the rejection probability is @xmath58 , that is , the null hypothesis is discarded when we are 99% sure that adding a new order to the series is statistically significant .",
    "in addition to this , we set the maximum number of harmonics to 6 , to avoid over - fitting . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show three lightcurves that were fit by the afd with different number of harmonics .",
    "it is reassuring to see that in each case , the algorithm appears to have set the series truncation according to the complexity of the lightcurve .",
    "aps makes period estimation given the available multi - epoch data more robust .",
    "our approach is to compare periods singled out by different period finding algorithms and quantify the goodness of fit by applying the afd lightcurve model ( see section  [ ssec : afd ] ) . in particular",
    ", we compare the periods proposed by two algorithms , namely analysis of variance ( aov ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lomb - scargle periodogram ( ls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the comparison is done by phasing the lightcurve with the five best periods proposed by each routine and calculating the goodness - of - fit parameter to discriminate between the periods and converge on the best one .",
    "since the sss photometry occasionally has some spurious measurements , we apply a simple cleaning routine by removing the most obvious outliers . in order to do this , we find the mean magnitude and the overall amplitude of the lightcurve from an initial afd and remove all datapoints that lie more than @xmath59 from the mean , where @xmath48 is the standard deviation of the mean lightcurve magnitude . with the outliers",
    "removed we then perform a second afd run .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] displays both the first afd model as well as the result of the second afd run after the outliers ( i.e. datapoints above the sigma - clipping limits shown ) have been removed .",
    "away from the mean , outside which the data is clipped .",
    "the impact of the outlier present at @xmath60 is clearly visible as the model shown by black dashed line is `` pulled '' towards the discrepant datapoint.,width=317 ]    additionally , there are two extra processes to further clean the lightcurve if need be : the conventional outlier clipping and the so - called gap - filling .",
    "note , however , that the clipping algorithm does not work well on lightcurves of deep eclipsing binaries , but can , in principle , be applied to rr lyrae variables .",
    "the process consists of clipping all datapoints of the lightcurve that lie more than @xmath59 from the recently computed afd model at a given phase , rather than from the overall mean of the lightcurve . in this case",
    ", @xmath48 is the mean error of the observations .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the lightcurve clipping boundaries and how these can be used to excise some of the outliers that have survived the first cut .",
    "the gap - filling process is triggered when there is a gap of more than 0.1 in the lightcurve phase . when this condition is satisfied , a `` data '' point is included in the lightcurve based on the previously calculated afd .",
    "the synthetic observation is positioned according to a simple linear interpolation between the phase values at the edges of the gap .",
    "the interpolation points are chosen as the mean of the three points closest to the edges on each side of the gap ( in phase space ) .",
    "this process relies on the previous afd run to assign the appropriate magnitudes around the edge .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , this helps to remove extreme wriggles from the model lightcurve .",
    "the post - processing techniques described above are used to improve the lightcurve shape estimation when applying the afd .",
    "subsequently , we utilize the afd goodness - of - fit to discriminate between possible test periods .    , but for a different method of clipping . here , instead of discarding all datapoints that are outside a fixed range given by the mean and the standard deviation of the lightcurve measurements , a sliding threshold is used . at each phase , the clipping threshold is calculated with respect to the value of the previous afd model fit .",
    "the effect of the datapoints outside the accepted region is less important than in the aforementioned plain sigma - clipping process , but these can add noticeable wriggles to the afd fit as illustrated by the differences between the black dashed line ( before clipping ) and the green solid line ( after clipping).,width=317 ]        to select the best period the following rules are applied .",
    "first , if two period candidates have a difference of more than 10% in reduced @xmath44 , the best period is selected . if this condition is not met , but the two first candidates of aov and ls are similar ( i.e. their difference is lower than @xmath61 days ) , and match one of the two best periods ranked by the reduced @xmath44 test , that period is selected . if neither of the two criteria is met , but the first two periods are aliases ( either double or half the period ) , then , since the aov periodogram is able to damp the detection sensitivity for aliased periods @xcite , the one ranked higher by aov is chosen . finally ,",
    "if neither of these conditions is met , the star is flagged as having a problematic period .",
    "we also flag stars with reduced @xmath62 and those with periods greater than 4 days , since given the pre - selection condition mentioned in  [ sec : odc ] , we do not expect to find stars with periods that long , and they are usually associated with spurious period candidates .",
    "the @xmath44 distribution of the accepted lightcurves peaks at @xmath63 rather than @xmath64 .",
    "there are several possibilities to explain the location of the peak .",
    "first , the error of the sss observations might be overestimated .",
    "second , we might be over - fitting the lightcurves , and finally , of course , there could be a combination of the first two .",
    "while overfitting is difficult to avoid in some cases , we point out that the main point of the afd is to avoid this and provide better lightcurve characterizations at the same time . therefore , we believe that the peak value of the @xmath65 distribution might be due to a combination of an overestimation of the errors of the observations , and somewhat over - zealous removal of the outliers which are , of course , the main causes of high @xmath65 .    finally , we test the performance of the aps algorithm on @xmath66 randomly chosen phased lightcurves . visual inspection of this sub - set confirms that the method can correctly select the periods when both aov and ls agree , when they do not agree , and even when they both fail with their most significant period candidate .",
    "note that , in order to avoid contamination , we have made this method very restrictive .",
    "in other words , if the @xmath65 test can not tell the difference between the two best period candidates , we leave the star out of the sample .",
    "this culls only of order of @xmath67 of the sample .",
    "combined with the stars that could not be modeled with the afd ( i.e. , reduced @xmath62 ) , and the stars with periods in excess of 4 days , the total number of rejected lightcurves is of order of @xmath68 .",
    "this is a reasonably small price to pay , provided we achieve reliable period estimation for the remaining @xmath69 of the stars .",
    "we believe , based on the test described above , that out of these only @xmath70 have wrong periods .",
    "armed with the period and the lightcurve shape information , we proceed to select the most likely rrab stars from the sample of variable objects . note that all objects flagged to have unreliable periods ( as described in the previous sections ) are removed , which leaves a total number of @xmath71 candidates . within the period range occupied by rrab s ,",
    "the other common periodic variables are eclipsing binaries . to differentiate between pulsating and eclipsing stars",
    ", we introduce the m - test , a simple lightcurve shape statistic motivated by @xcite , and already utilized in @xcite .",
    "this is defined as follows :    @xmath72    where m denotes magnitude .",
    "in essence , the m - statistic @xmath73 measures the amount of time the star spends above ( @xmath74 ) or below ( @xmath75 ) a baseline defined by the mean magnitude . to mitigate the destructive action of outliers ,",
    "all parameters used to calculate @xmath73 are extracted from the afd model .",
    "this is the principal difference with the original method as proposed by @xcite , where the actual lightcurve data is used to calculate the m - statistic .",
    "different types of variables occupy different positions , in a period vs. @xmath73 diagram . to determine the exact boundaries of the different classes in this plane , @xmath76 randomly selected variables were classified by eye into three groups : rrab s , detached eclipsing binaries and rrc / w uma- type eclipsing binaries .",
    "figure [ fig : fig6 ] shows the locations of these groups in period-@xmath73 space . as is obvious from this figure , rrab s form a tight and fairly isolated group with high values of the m - statistic . to further clean our sample",
    ", we removed all lightcurves that have more than one peak in phase space .",
    "this is achieved by tagging all the stars whose amplitude in the higher harmonics of the afd model is larger than the amplitude of the first harmonic . with regards to the rr lyrae of c type",
    ", there possibly exists a region in figure [ fig : fig6 ] , i.e. at low periods and intermediate @xmath73 , which is predominantly populated by these pulsators .",
    "however , the levels of contamination with w uma stars are still high .",

    "figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows the behaviour of the error with increasing apparent magnitude . to model the error evolution as a function of magnitude",
    ", an exponential model is used : @xmath95 ) , \\label{eq : res1}\\ ] ]    .,width=317 ]    where @xmath96 corresponds to the brightest star in our sample . to generate the synthetic rrab , pulse amplitudes as well as phases of random stars in the sample",
    "are used ; the errors are obtained from equation [ eq : res1 ] , and the noise is drawn from a normal distribution with sigma as given by equation [ eq : res1 ] . for each magnitude bin ,",
    "100 synthetic rrab are generated , in the range @xmath97 .",
    "we then run the aps algorithm and count the number of mock rrab we can recover as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig11 ] illustrates that at least 60% of the rrab with @xmath98 are recovered .",
    "the same figure also reveals that the efficiency of the period estimation is even higher , reaching @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to mention that the aps was set to have the cleanest sample possible in a fully automatic mode which explains why the efficiency drops down at the faint end .",
    "this is , of course , unavoidable since at these magnitudes the photometric error becomes comparable to the pulse amplitudes of rrab stars , making it difficult for a fully automated procedure to identify correctly the exact type of variability .",
    "nevertheless , as part of the output of the program , the information on the rejected stars is recorded , so that the faint rrab discarded by our search algorithm can be recovered in the future .",
    "the analysis described above concerns only the efficiency of the period determination and the rrab classification .",
    "the actual completeness of our sample , i.e. the amount of stars expected to be recovered versus the actual number of stars measured , needs to take into account the variability and the periodicity checks described in section [ sec : odc ] .",
    "an example of an empirical approach to check the completeness of the rrab sample can be found in @xcite , which reports an efficiency of @xmath100 for the rrab sample found by the css . since both the css and the sss performed the same steps to classify rrab",
    ", this could serve as an adequate estimate of the overall completeness of the sss rrab sample presented in this paper .",
    "in fact , we have verified this statement by counting all stars that lie in the sss footprint and are recorded as rrab in the vsx catalog @xcite .",
    "there are 1919 rrab in the vsx of which we identify 1321 , resulting in a completeness level of @xmath101 .",
    "if we now remove detections along the borders of the survey , where objects can be spuriously included even if they were not observed sufficiently often by the sss , we identify 1075 out of 1521 stars , raising the completeness to @xmath102 .",
    "these tests illustrate that our efficiency is a strong function of the temporal sampling , increasing in the areas of the sky visited by the sss more frequently .",
    "for example , if we further limit the region of interest to @xmath103 and @xmath104 , i.e. the area sampled the densest by the sss , we detect @xmath105 of the rrab s in the vsx database .",
    "while this is encouraging , completeness estimates based on a comparison between our detections and the vsx entries should be taken with due caution , as the vsx catalog is highly inhomogeneous and has a much brighter cutoff with respect to sss .",
    "most importantly , we note that the vsx catalog is highly incomplete in the southern hemisphere , as it contains less than 10% of the total number of rrab s we have discovered .",
    "from the original sample of @xmath106 variable star candidates with periods between 0.3 and 4 days , we have selected @xmath2 rrab stars , of which @xmath107 correspond to new discoveries , 231 correspond to stars previously reported as rrab by @xcite , and the remaining @xmath108 correspond to stars previously available in the literature .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7 ] displays several examples of light curves for the rr lyrae identified in our search . figure [ fig : fig7a ] presents the distribution of rrab on the sky , using discoveries from all three catalina surveys . for all stars in the sss we provide",
    "metallicity , distance , galactic position , and lightcurve shape information ( through the afd parameters ) .",

    "are systematically reduced by 0.15 mag when compared to the typical rrab amplitudes . as a result",
    ", we provide a correction to the amplitudes to account for this effect .",
    "the diagram shows the @xcite oosterhoff type - i ( ooi ) and oosterhoff type - ii ( ooii ) lines , and the period shift with respect to the ooi line is shown on the right panel .",
    "this suggests that our data is composed of stars belonging to both ooi and ooii types , with the ooi population clearly being the dominant one . as in drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , we too find that the distribution is bimodal , with relatively few stars present between the canonical ooi and ooii loci .",

    "additionally , the figure shows a clump of stars at @xmath122 with distances between 30 and 50 kpc .",
