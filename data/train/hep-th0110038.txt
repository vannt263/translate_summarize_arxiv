    "today , a mathematical treatment of yang - mills theory generally makes use of fiber bundles and topology@xcite .",
    "but in spite of the use of such powerful mathematics , we are nowhere near the solution to the problem of confinement .",
    "in fact , however , this statement is not exactly correct .",
    "physicists do catch a glimpse of confinement by making use of particular gauge conditions .",
    "some examples are the abelian@xcite , center@xcite and non - linear gauges@xcite .",
    "these gauge conditions focus on specific configurations -monople for abelian , vortex for center and spherically synemetric scalars @xmath1 for the non - linear gauge , which may be responsible for confinement .",
    "naively , this result is paradoxical because confinement seems to be dependent on the choice of gauge .",
    "gauge theorists have always assumed that physical phenomena are gauge - independent . but is this really true ? in electrodynamics and perturbative",
    "non - abelian theory , the equivalence of quantization in various linear gauges can be shown using formal operations on the path - integral . alternatively , in a particular gauge , gauge - invariance is guaranteed by the ward - takahashi identity for abelian theory and lee - slavnov identities for non - abelian theory .    however , it is also true that physical states of the gauge fields are more transparent in certain gauges .",
    "for example , in abelian theory and in the short - distance regime of the non - abelian theory , the transverse photon and gluons satisfy the coulomb gauge .",
    "this shows that an appropriate choice of gauge can expose the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , if confinement is due to a specific gauge field or a class of gauge fields , then choosing a gauge , which highlights the field configuration(s ) is absolutely necessary .",
    "the gauge - independence of physical results must only be true then for gauge - fixing conditions that intersect all the orbits .",
    "this will guarantee that all field configurations are represented in the path - integral .",
    "thus , if certain physical phenomena are transparent in one gauge , the same physical phenomena must also be accounted for , although may not be as transparent , in another gauge as long as the two gauge conditions intersect all the orbits .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the problem of gauge - fixing by analyzing the configuration space of yang - mills theory",
    ". we will be employing concepts used in finite dimensional euclidean space and extend them in the infinite dimensional configuration space . to visualize the concepts used",
    ", we will @xmath2 count the dimension and the number of elements in the gauge parameter and configuration spaces of both the abelian and non - abelian theories .",
    "we then show that a global orthogonal gauge can be defined for the abelian theory but not for the non - abelian case .",
    "next we present arguments why non - linear gauge - fixing is natural for the yang - mills theory .",
    "then we modify the orthogonality condition to derive the non - linear gauge .",
    "unfortunately , unlike in the abelian theory where coulomb - like sufaces foliate the entire configuration space , the non - linear submanifolds seem to be valid only in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "consider yang - mills theory in 4d euclidean space - time .",
    "the configuration space is an infinite dimensional space where the ( cartesian ) axes are @xmath3 , i.e. , the components of the gauge field at each point defined by @xmath4 .",
    "the dimension of the configuration space is @xmath5 , where 3 comes from the su(2 ) index @xmath6 , 4 from the lorentz index @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the euclidean space - time coordinates ( the number of points on a line is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is very large and approaches @xmath11 as the spacing @xmath12 between points approaches zero ) .",

    "this ladder - like structure follows from applying equation ( [ 8 ] ) on both @xmath38 and the origin and then subtracting the gauge transformed results .",

    "we generate the ladder - like structure of the two orbits . if this is true for @xmath68 and @xmath60 , it is also true for @xmath76 and @xmath60 and also for @xmath68 and @xmath77 .",
    "the orbits , though twisting and turning in a complicated way , maintain the same distance between corresponding points on the two orbits .",
    "the orbits therefore form a congruence set , i.e. , they cover the configuration space without intersecting .",
    "this simple observation is significant for the following reasons .",
    "if the gauge - fixing submanifold does not intersect @xmath60 uniquely , it will not intersect neighboring orbits uniquely also ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if we know how @xmath60 twists and turns , then we know how all the other orbits twist and turn also .",

    "note the distance between corresponding points on the orbits are all the same ]    .",
    "[ fig2 ]    finally , we note why the path - integral is invariant under gauge transformation .",

    "equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) establish the invariance of the path - integral under gauge - transformation .",

    "gauge fixing is the process of choosing representative field configurations from each orbit .",
    "ideally , the gauge - fixing should choose only one representative from each orbit and all orbits should be represented .",
    "this condition is equivalent to saying that the gauge - fixing condition is unique and always realizable .",

    "the ideal condition is satisfied in only one case , the coulomb gauge fixing of an abelian theory . in all the other linear gauge - fixing of abelian and non - abelian theories ,",
    "realizability is generally taken for granted while non - uniqueness is rectified through subsidiary conditions ( gupta - bleuler condition in lorentz gauge ) or fadeev - popov determinants .    in configuration space ,",
    "gauge - fixing is tantamount to choosing a submanifold where all orbits must pass through .",
    "since one of the four @xmath91 for each a and at each x essentially becomes a dependent variable when @xmath92=0 $ ] is imposed , the submanifold @xmath93 defined by the gauge - fixing is naively @xmath94 dimensional .",
    "the issue now is what geometrical principle should be used in choosing @xmath93 .",
    "the simplest and most compelling principle is to require global orthogonality of the orbit to @xmath93 .",
    "this will guarantee uniqueness and realizability .",
    "as stated already this is only achieved in the coulomb gauge formulation of an abelian theory .",

    ", there are only three independent potentials at each point thus the submanifold of transverse potentials @xmath93 in configuration space has dimension @xmath97 .",
    "this means that @xmath93 is defined by @xmath98 i.e. , it is the intersection of hyperplanes ( dimension equal to @xmath99 ) defined by each @xmath100 , the total of which is @xmath101 .",
    "below , we will determine @xmath102 geometrically .",
    "we will also argue that there is a sufficient number of @xmath103 s in the u(1 ) gauge parameter space to ensure that @xmath93 is an appropriate submanifold .",
    "+ let us now determine @xmath102 by imposing that the normal to @xmath102 at @xmath38 is equal to the tangent to the orbit .",

    "definitely there are infinitely many functions with such behaviour .",
    "this proves that we can find a sufficient number of @xmath103 s that can define @xmath102 .",
    "equation ( [ 31 ] ) implies that equation ( [ 29 ] ) gives zero .",

    "this shows that the submanifolds @xmath134 foliate the configuration space .",
    "equivalently , we can show that the submanifolds defined by equations ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) foliate the configuration space by making use of the frobenius theorem . in the following",

    ", it follows that @xmath141 i.e. , on the submanifold @xmath138 , the tangent vectors annul the one forms . in particular , on the coulomb gauge submanifold given by @xmath142 , this follows from    @xmath143    since @xmath88 is transverse on @xmath144 , we can write @xmath145 giving @xmath146    substituting equation ( [ 39 ] ) in equation ( [ 34 ] ) verifies equation ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "all these prove that the submanifolds @xmath138 where the orbits are orthogonal , are leaves in the foliation of the entire configuration space .",
    "+ in the non - abelian case , the tangent to the orbit is the vector @xmath84 defined by equation([22 ] ) . imposing that this is equal to the normal to the surface defined by @xmath147 = constant implies @xmath148 because of the second term , there is no solution to equation ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "hence , the conclusion that there exists no orthogonal gauge condition , local or global , in the non - abelian case .",
    "this result had been established by various authors , including chodos and moncrief@xcite , who used the vector version of frobenius theorem .",
    "we will now discuss the non - linear gauge , which was discussed by the author in a series of articles .",
    "initially , the author s justification for the gauge condition is the fact that there are field configurations missed by the coulomb gauge@xcite .",
    "these are the field configurations that are on the gribov horizon of the @xmath149 surface . in subsequent papers",
    ", the author showed that the gauge condition `` reveals '' the physical degrees of freedom , which depend on the distance scale , of the non - abelian theory . at short distance ,",
    "i.e. , well inside hadrons , transverse gluons exist and interact very weakly with quarks .",
    "this is accounted for by the linear limit of the non - linear gauge . at large distance scales ,",
    "the important field configurations are the new scalar fields @xmath150 , which has an infinitely non - linear effective action .",
    "the classical , stochastic dynamics of spherically symmetric @xmath151 leads to the linear potential@xcite while the full quantum dynamics leads to dimensional reduction@xcite .",
    "what we would like to raise at this point is the question , is there a geometrical basis for the non - linear gauge ?",
    "the answer is yes and the arguments essentially follow equations ( 26 ) to ( 39 ) in the abelian case .",
    "before we answer this question , we note that since the orbit through @xmath38 twists and turns in configuration space ( see discussions in section ii ) , it is most unlikely that there exists a linear submanifold that intersects all orbits uniquely .",
    "as shown in reference ( 7 ) , it may also happen that a linear submanifold may not intersect some orbits at all .",
    "for this reason , there are those who proposed covering the submanifold by local patches centered around background gauge fields@xcite .",
    "this gauge fixing is essentially a collection of linear gauges .",
    "however , beyond formal expressions for the path - integral and global expectation values for gauge - invariant quantities , this formalism has not really shown confinement .",
    "also , a collection of linear gauges actually suggests non - linearity of the entire submanifold .",
    "the non - linear gauge is also hinted by equation ( [ 40 ] ) , which states that the orbit is orthogonal to the gauge - fixing surface .",
    "since the rhs of equation ( [ 40 ] ) is linear in a , the hyperplane @xmath147 = constant must be quadratic in a. unfortunately , the anti - symmetric @xmath152 precludes the existence of a solution .    but suppose we modify equation ( [ 40 ] ) to something like @xmath153 equation ( [ 41 ] ) states that the normal to the hyperplane @xmath147 = constant is a linear combination of the components of the tangent to the orbit at @xmath38 ( with components @xmath154 ) .",
    "this means that the gauge - fixing submanifold @xmath138 given by the intersections of the hyperplanes @xmath155 , i.e. @xmath156 intersects the orbit but is not orthogonal to it .",

    "going back to equation ( [ 54 ] ) , we find that @xmath202_{y}\\nonumber\\\\ & - & d^{ab}_{\\mu}(x)\\int d^{4 } y h^{bc}(x , y;a)[(d\\cdot\\partial)^{cd}\\partial_{\\alpha}d a^{d}_{\\alpha}]_{y}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&d^{ab}_{\\mu}(x)\\int d^{4}y h^{bc}(x , y;a)[(-)\\epsilon^{cde } da^{e}_{\\alpha}\\partial_{\\alpha}(\\partial\\cdot a^{d})]_{y}\\nonumber\\\\ & - & d^{ab}_{\\mu}(x)\\int d^{4 } y d^{4 } z\\frac{\\delta h^{bc}}{\\delta a^{f}_{\\alpha}(z)}(x , y;a)da^{f}_{\\alpha}(z)[(d\\cdot\\partial)^{cd}(\\partial\\cdot a^{d})]_{y}\\label{60}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath203 is the green function of @xmath192 . the last term is evaluated by using @xmath204    substituting equation ( [ 60 ] ) , in equations ( [ 52 ] ) , we verify equation ( [ 53 ] ) after doing integration by parts .",
    "+ at this point we ask , do the submanifolds @xmath205 given by equations ( [ 42 ] ) to ( [ 48 ] ) foliate the entire configuration space of yang - mills theory in the same way that the coulomb - like surfaces discussed in section 3 foliate the abelian configuration space ?",
    "the answer is no as we will argue below .",
    "+ in section 3 , the foliation by coulomb - like surfaces of the abelian configuration space is not subject to any restrictions .",
    "thus , the entire configuration space can be foliated by the coulomb - like surfaces , which are derived from the condition of orthogonality of the orbit to the submanifold .",
    "+ on the other hand , equations ( [ 41 ] ) to ( [ 61 ] ) have built - in conditions .",
    "+ first , the non - linear gauge given by equation ( [ 46 ] ) has two regimes : @xmath206 @xmath207    the first is the coulomb gauge , which describes the physical degrees of freedom in the short - distance regime as argued in reference @xcite .",
    "the second is the quadratic regime , which was shown to yield non - perturbative physics in the @xmath208 dynamics ( see references @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "+ second , field configurations satisfying @xmath209 , with @xmath210 , can be gauge transformed to the coulomb surface . for these field configurations , the orbit ,",
    "although not necessarily orthogonal to coulomb - like surfaces , will never be tangential to these surfaces .",
    "this is seen by computing the angle between the tangent to the orbit and normal to the surface given by @xmath211 since @xmath190 is non - singular , it has no zero modes and @xmath212 is never equal to @xmath213 .",
    "this means the orbit is never tangential to the coulomb - like surface .",
    "+ third , if @xmath214 , then @xmath190 has zero mode @xmath215 and @xmath216 may be zero . in this case",
    ", the orbit is tangential to the coulomb - like surface .",
    "+ fourth , if the zero mode of @xmath190 is @xmath217 , then the appropriate submanifolds are defined by equations ( [ 42 ] ) to ( [ 61 ] ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that the submanifolds @xmath205 are only valid in the regimes defined by the restricting conditions . and these are , for @xmath205 , ( a)@xmath209 , ( b ) the only zero mode of @xmath190 is @xmath201 , which leads to the non - singular character of the fourth - order operator @xmath218 .",
    "the important thing though is that the orbit , although not orthogonal to the submanifold , is also never tangential to it ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this follows from @xmath219 which is never zero because @xmath218 has no zero modes .",
    "+ finally , we conjecture that maybe the non - existence of submanifolds which can foliate the entire configuration space is a reflection of the fact that the physical degrees of freedom of yang - mills theory change with the distance scale . in short - distance regime ,",
    "massless , transverse gluons are valid degrees of freedom . in the long - distance regime ,",
    "transverse gluons are not valid degrees of freedom .",
    "this paper and references @xcite and@xcite argue that the scalar @xmath208 and vector fields @xmath220 , which arise from the non - linear gauge should be used instead . for comparison purposes ,",
    "note that the coulomb - like submanifolds , which comes from orthogonality condition , foliate the entire abelian configuration space and this may be related to the fact that the transverse photon is a physical degree of freedom in all distance scales .    ,",
    "defined by the non - linear gauge and the orbit @xmath73 make an angle @xmath221 , which is never equal to @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath221 is the angle between the normal to @xmath144 ( given by @xmath222 ) and the tangent to the orbit ( given by @xmath84 ) . ]",
    "in this paper , we have established the geometrical basis of the non - linear gauge condition .",
    "we have shown that although the orbit is never orthogonal to @xmath144 , it is also never tangential to the surface @xmath223 . unfortunately , the submanifolds @xmath205 is shown to be not capable of foliating the entire configuration space but only the non - perturbative regime of yang - mills theory .",
