    "one may construct operations on the hochschild chain complex @xmath68 analogue to string topology operations @xcite .",
    "one of the main points we would like to stress in this paper is the following surprising observation : when the product @xmath48 is applied to a pair of hochschild chains we obtain an operation which was previously described in @xcite and @xcite , in the case when @xmath0 is commutative , and is believed to be intimately related to the goresky - hingston product on @xmath69 , a string topology operation of degree @xmath70 constructed on the cohomology of the free loop space of a @xmath21-dimensional manifold relative to constant loops .",
    "+ more precisely , for any symmetric frobenius differential graded algebra @xmath0 with pairing of degree @xmath21 , abbaspour describes in @xcite an associative product @xmath71 of degree @xmath70 which arises as a chain homotopy between two chain maps @xmath72 each of degree @xmath21 . the operation @xmath73 is sometimes called a _ secondary",
    "_ operation since it is a chain homotopy between two _ primary _ operations ; note , in particular , that @xmath73 is not a chain map .",
    "the construction of @xmath73 resembles a chain level version of a geometric string topology product on @xmath74 ( described in @xcite at the level of relative cohomology @xmath75 ) which is dual to an operation which , at the level of chains , considers self intersections in a chain of loops and splits loops at these intersection points .",
    "there are several ways of obtaining a chain map from @xmath73 . in the case",
    "@xmath0 is commutative abbaspour suggests taking a subcomplex of @xmath76 and klamt suggests modifying the product @xmath73 in order to obtain a chain map .",
    "we do not assume commutativity for @xmath0 and propose extending the chain complex @xmath68 by extending the differential through the map @xmath77 defined in ( [ equation - cardy ] ) .",
    "we may keep extending the resulting complex by the hochschild cochains differential to obtain an unbounded double complex and we may extend the product @xmath73 as well by hochschild cup and cap products .",
    "the resulting complex , after appropriate degree shifts , is precisely @xmath78 and the new product is @xmath54 . in conclusion , one may interpret @xmath79 as combination of the cup product in hochschild cochains , which is an algebraic analogue of the chas - sullivan loop product , and the @xmath73-product in hochschild chains , an algebraic analogue of the goresky - hingston product .",
    "we finish this article by describing the singular hochschild cohomology of the dga of singular cochains on a simply connected manifold @xmath62 in terms of the homology and cohomology of @xmath80 .",
    "we do this by first proving an invariance result for singular hochschild cohomology under dga quasi - isomorphisms and then using a dg symmetric frobenius algebra model for @xmath62 as provided by the main result of @xcite .",
    "we use these results to calculate explicitly the singular hochschild cohomology and its bv - algebra structure for the differential graded algebra @xmath81 of singular cochains on spheres @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "+ there is a close relationship between the singular hochschild cohomology of the dga of singular cochains on a closed simply connected manifold @xmath62 and the _ rabinowitz - floer homology _ of the unit cotangent bundle of @xmath62 with its canonical symplectic structure as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relationship comes from the isomorphism between the symplectic ( co)homology of the unit cotangent bundle of @xmath62 and the singular ( co)homology of the free loop space of @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , one should compare theorem 1.10 in @xcite with theorem 7.1 of this article .",
    "moreover , in @xcite an algebra structure on the rabinowitz - floer side is constructed and we conjecture that such structure agrees with the algebra structure of the singular hochschild cohomology of the dga of singular cochains of @xmath62 . based on the constructions of @xcite , it is also evident that the singular hochschild cohomology is closely related to the symplectic homology of the boundary of a liouville domain .",
