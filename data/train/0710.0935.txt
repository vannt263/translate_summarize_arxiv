    "the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , which includes correlations in the ground state , provides a simple theory of excited states of the nucleus . however , the rpa breaks down at a certain value @xmath2 of interaction parameter @xmath1 , where it yields imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "the reason is that the rpa equations , linear with respect to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 amplitudes of the rpa excitation operator , are derived based on the quasi - boson approximation ( qba ) .",
    "the latter neglects the pauli principle between fermion pairs and its validity is getting poor with increasing the interaction parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the collapse of the rpa at the critical value @xmath2 of @xmath1 invalidates the use of the qba .",
    "the rpa therefore needs to be extended to correct this deficiency , at least for finite systems such as nuclei .",
    "+ one of methods to restore the pauli principle is to renormalize the conventional rpa to include the non - zero values of the commutator between the fermion - pair operators in the correlated ground state .",
    "these so - called ground - state correlations beyond rpa are neglected within the qba . the interaction in this way is renormalized and the collapse of rpa is avoided .",
    "the resulting theory is called the renormalized rpa ( rrpa ) @xcite . however , the test of the rrpa carried out within several exactly solvable models showed that the rrpa results are still far from the exact solutions @xcite .",
    "+ recently , a significant development in improving the rpa has been carried out within the self - consistent rpa ( scrpa ) @xcite .",
    "based on the same concept of renormalizing the particle - particle ( @xmath5 ) rpa , the scrpa made a step forward by including the screening factors , which are the expectation values of the products of two pairing operators in the correlated ground state .",
    "the scrpa has been applied to the exactly solvable multi - level pairing model , where the energies of the ground state and first excited state in the system with @xmath6 particles relative to the energy of the ground - state level in the @xmath7-particle system are calculated and compared with the exact results .",
    "it has been found that the agreement with the exact solutions is good only in the weak coupling region , where the pairing - interaction parameter @xmath1 is smaller than the critical values @xmath2 . in the strong coupling region ( @xmath8 ) , the agreement between the scrpa and exact results becomes poor  @xcite . in this region",

    "however , the scqrpa also collapses at @xmath9 .",

    "obviously , the collapse of the scqrpa at @xmath9 , which is the same as that of the non - trivial solution for the pairing gap within the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory ( bcs ) , can be removed by performing the particle - number projection ( pnp ) .",
    "the lipkin - nogami method @xcite , which is an approximated pnp before variation , will be used in such extension of the scqrpa in the present paper because of its simplicity .",

    "<S> particle - number projection within the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method is applied to the self - consistent quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( scqrpa ) , which is tested in an exactly solvable multi - level pairing model . </S>",
    "<S> the scqrpa equations are numerically solved to find the energies of the ground and excited states at various numbers @xmath0 of doubly degenerate equidistant levels . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the ln method allows one to avoid the collapse of the bcs ( qrpa ) to obtain the energies of the ground and excited states as smooth functions of the interaction parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between results given by different approximations such as the scrpa , qrpa , lnqrpa , scqrpa and lnscqrpa is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> while the use of the ln method significantly improves the agreement with the exact results in the intermediate coupling region , we found that in the strong coupling region the scqrpa results are closest to the exact ones . </S>"
