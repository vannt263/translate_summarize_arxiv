    "decoherence of a quantum system ( appearance of classical features in its behavior ) is caused by its interaction with the environment @xcite .",
    "decoherence may be presented as a series of fuzzy measurements or as a continuous fuzzy measurement ( cfm ) .",
    "hence , any phenomenological description of cfm may be considered as a phenomenological description of decoherence @xcite .",
    "many models of decoherence in accordance with the scheme     @xmath0    ( i.e. including the system , its environment and their interaction ) were proposed @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . in the model of quantum diffusion or quantum brownian",
    "motion @xcite a particle moves through a crystal interacting with its atoms so that the information about its motion is recorded in the state of the crystal modes ( phonons ) . the resulting equation for the density matrix of the particle has ( in a special case ) the form @xmath1            - \\frac 12 \\kappa [ \\mathbf r\\ , [ \\mathbf r\\ , \\rho ] ] \\label{qudiffuseq}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the damping coefficient ) .",
    "another model of quantum diffusion is constructed in @xcite as a model of continuous monitoring of the particle position due to its interaction with internal degrees of freedom of surrounding atoms .",
    "the resulting equation is the same but with the coefficient @xmath4 depending on the radius @xmath5 of the particle - atom interaction and relaxation time @xmath6 of an atom .",
    "both these models describe decoherence , but in the first case it is decoherence by crystal modes while in the second case  decoherence by internal structure of atoms .",
    "the lesson which may be learnt is that decoherence may be treated as a continuous measurement ( compare eq .",
    "( [ qudiffuseq ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ lindbladeq ] ) ) .",
    "this feature is in fact general @xcite : the process of gradual decoherence may be presented ( or interpreted ) as a process of quantum _ continuous fuzzy measurement _ ( cfm ) .",
    "indeed , an instantaneous ( in reality short ) fuzzy measurement is a measurement ( entanglement ) having a poor resolution , but in a series of such measurements the resolution improves , and finally becomes complete ( in the case of a discrete spectrum of the measured observable ) .",
    "for example , a series of fuzzy measurements of an observable having two eigenvalues changes the state of the measured system in the following way :    = n y[fig - repeat - fuzzy ]    @xmath7    the final result of this process may be presented by the von neumann s projection , while the process itself is nothing else than gradual decoherence or cfm .",
    "one may describe cfm ( decoherence ) phenomenologically .",
    "this means that the environment is not explicitly included in the description , but its influence is taken into account phenomenologically , according to the scheme    @xmath0    in this case the system is considered to be open .    a _ nonselective _ description of an ( open ) continuously measured system is given by _ lindblad master equation _",
    "@xcite which in the simplest case reads as follows ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ qudiffuseq ] ) ) : @xmath1            - \\frac 12 \\kappa [ a , [ a , \\rho ] ] .   \\label{lindbladeq}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is an observable which is measured continuously and the constant @xmath9 characterizes the measurement resolution ( this interpretation was not given by lindblad , but it is clear from another approach , see below eq .",

    "a _ selective _ description of the same process refers to a certain state of the environment or a certain measurement readout . in the simplest case , when the process is considered to be sequential ( as in sect .",
    "[ sectdecocfm ] ) rather than continuous , the evolution of the system is presented by the evolution operator @xmath10 equal to the product of unitary evolution operators and positive operators presenting results of instantaneous fuzzy measurements , @xmath11 .    a more sophisticated way to describe cfm selectively is the nonlinear stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath12 |\\psi\\rangle dt            + \\sqrt{2\\kappa } \\big ( a-\\langle a\\rangle\\big )   |\\psi\\rangle dw , \\nonumber\\\\",

    "it is evident that an additional criterion is necessary to choose correct selective description even if the nonselective description is known .",
    "the following approach is unambiguous .",

    "the norm of the wave function at the end of the process determines the probability density of the given measurement readout @xmath16 .",

    "the evolution of a closed system is described by the evolution operator  @xmath22 , @xmath23 presented in the feynman version of quantum mechanics by a path integral : @xmath24\\,e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s[q ] } = \\int d[p]d[q]\\ , e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_0^t ( p\\dot q - h(p , q , t))}\\ ] ]    = n y[fig - feynman ]    an ideology behind the path integral is that the total amplitude is a sum of the amplitudes @xmath25/\\hbar)$ ] corresponding to individual paths . in the case of a continuous measurement this must be the sum over those paths which are compatible with the information supplied by the measurement .",
    "this gives an integral restricted to a subset of paths , or the usual feynman path integral but with a weight functional depending on the measurement readout @xmath26 : @xmath27d[q]\\,w_\\alpha[p , q]\\ , e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_0^t ( p\\dot q - h(p , q , t ) ) } \\label{rpi}\\ ] ]    = n y[fig - rpi ]    the evolution of the system ( depending on the readout @xmath26 ) is then @xmath28 and the probability density of the readout @xmath26 is @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the moment when the continuous measurement is over ) . a complete description of the evolution is given in this case by a family of _ partial evolution operators _ @xmath31 corresponding to all possible measurement readouts @xmath26 .",
    "the set of paths corresponding to the given @xmath26 may be called a _ quantum corridor _ in analogy with quantum trajectories of carmichael @xcite . in the general case",

    "it has been implicitly assumed in the preceding argument that monitoring is performed with the absolute resolution of time so that the number @xmath16 is an estimate of the observable @xmath8 in the precisely known time moment @xmath43 . in some cases",
    "the finite resolution of time ( inertial properties of the measuring medium ) must be taken into account .",

    "the closed system in the ch approach includes both the measured and measuring subsystems , while in the rpi approach only the measured system is included , while the influence of the environment is taken into account implicitly .",
    "this is why in the ch approach together with the given family of histories more coarse - grained families have to be considered and consistency between them must be required . on the contrary , in the rpi approach the family of quantum corridors",
