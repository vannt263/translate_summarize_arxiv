    "there is a good reason to think that proper description of pseudogap regime is the avenue of approach to the physical nature of high-@xmath10 superconductivity  @xcite . angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has been coming along this way very well in recent years .",
    "one of the test compounds for arpes is the hole doped bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( bi2212 ) system .",
    "another example is the electron doped high - t@xmath0 nd@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) . to this end",
    "there are plenty of experimental arpes data on bi2212 and ncco ( see the review  @xcite ) .",
    "fermi surface ( fs ) maps , quasiparticle band dispersions and even self - energy lineshapes within mapping on some models are reliably extracted from modern arpes data  @xcite .",
    "there are several interesting physical phenomena associated with pseudo gap regime ( in the normal underdoped phase ) : partial fs `` destruction '' and folding of band dispersions ( shadow bands ) for both compounds bi2212 and ncco @xcite . despite evident similarities of experimental observations for these two systems",
    "there is one striking distinction .",
    "the fs of bi2212 has so called fermi `` arcs '' around ( @xmath13/2,@xmath13/2 ) point ( looking like a part of noninteracting fs ) , while towards bz borders sharply defined fs just vanishes . in its turn ncco also possesses slightly degraded fermi `` arcs '' , but in the vicinity of bz borders noninteracting fs is almost restored . in",
    "between there are well known `` hot - spots ''  areas of fs `` destruction '' around the points where fs intersects umklapp bz border .",
    "these `` hot - spots '' are not observed so obviously for bi2212 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show the origin of this ncco `` hot - spots '' behavior .",
    "both systems under consideration are usually treated as mott insulators at moderate doping or , in other words , as strongly correlated metals .",
    "modern technique to solve the hubbard model is dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , which is exact in infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , the quasi two - dimensional nature of high - t@xmath0 compounds is well known . to overcome the local nature of the dmft approximation , we have proposed recently a semiphenomenological dmft+@xmath4 computational scheme @xcite . here",
    "an additional self - energy @xmath4 describes non - local correlations induced by ( quasi ) static short - ranged collective heisenberg - like antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin ( pseudogap ) fluctuations @xcite . assuming additive form of the self - energy within dmft+@xmath4 approach one can preserve conventional dmft self - consistent set of equations . to take into account material specific properties of both bi2212 and ncco",
    "we perform first principle one - electron density functional theory calculations within local densty approximation ( dft / lda ) @xcite .",
    "then lda results are incorporated into dmft+@xmath4 in accord with lda+dmft ideology @xcite . to solve the effective single impurity problem of the dmft we employ here the reliable numerical renormalization group approach ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "such combined lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme by construction is particularly suitable to describe electronic properties of real high - t@xmath0 materials at finite doping in the normal state .",
    "the dmft+@xmath4 approach was extensively applied during the last years to describe formation of pseudogap within strongly correlated metallic regime of single - band hubbard model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "we have also generalized dmft+@xmath4 approach for the account of static disorder effects @xcite .",
    "later we have derived dmft+@xmath4 approach to calculate two - particle properties ( such as optical conductivity )  @xcite .",
    "recently dmft+@xmath4 was used by us to analyze the general problem of metal  insulator transition in strongly disordered and strongly correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme was already used to describe pseudogap regime in `` realistic '' calculations for bi2212  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we apply this approach to ncco aiming to describe the characteristic differences of its electronic structure as compared to bi2212 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ method ]",
    "we present a short introduction into an @xmath14 self - consistent generalized combined lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme and its extension for two particle properties ( optical conductivity ) .",

    "results and discussion of lda+dmft+@xmath4 calculations for bi2212 and ncco and comparisons with experimental data are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "section [ concl ] concludes our manuscript with the summary and discussion of some of the remaining problems .",
    "to introduce spatial length scale ( nonlocal correlations ) into conventional dmft method @xcite we have recently proposed the generalized dmft+@xmath4 approach @xcite , with computational scheme , shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , which contains the flow diagram of self consistent dmft+@xmath4 set of equations .",
    "first we guess some initial local ( dmft ) electron self - energy @xmath15 .",
    "second we compute by any available technique ( for the chosen model ) @xmath5-dependent `` external '' self - energy @xmath16 which can be in general case a functional of @xmath15 .",
    "then neglecting interference effects between the self - energies ( which in fact is the major assumption of our approach ) we can set up and solve the lattice problem of dmft ( step 3 in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) . then at step 4",
    "we define effective anderson single impurity problem which is to be solved by any `` impurity solver '' to close dmft+@xmath4 equations .    the additive form of self - energy ( at step 3 in fig .  [ scheme ]",

    "spectral functions become slightly more blurred and fs less sharply defined . also with the increase of the @xmath30",
    "value quasiparticle mass grows up a little bit . in optical conductivity",
    "the pseudogap anomaly also appears to be more damped , as we mentioned earlier in ref.@xcite . at the same time the general agreement with experiments stays reasonable .",

    "if this connection is taken into account fs maps do not differ very much from those obtained above .",
    "however , the pseudogap effects are getting stronger both around `` hot - spots '' and in the vicinity of @xmath53 * k*-point . in this case comparison with arpes data for quasiparticle bands becomes much more worse .",
    "especially , the bigger @xmath30 values spoil the accord with optical data .",
    "thus we can conclude , that constrained lda calculated value of @xmath30 ( together with corresponding value of @xmath9 ) allows one to describe arpes experimental data reasonably well , though in optical conductivity the size of the pseudogap is a bit overestimated .",
    "in other respects , we do not observe any qualitative changes in our results as @xmath30 increase from 3@xmath25 to 4@xmath25 or 6@xmath25 .",
    "to summarize , the origin of evident `` hot - spots '' on ncco fs in pseudogap regime is attributed to the details of noninteracting electronic band structure of this compound .",
    "all differences in physical properties calculated within the lda+dmft+@xmath4 approach ( quasiparticle bands , fs maps and arpes data ) are determined by the fact that in ncco `` hot - spots '' lie closer to bz center than in bi2212 . also stronger afm long range ordering tendency in ncco favors the clearly visible `` hot - spots '' . besides that , the qualitative behavior of both electron doped ncco and hole doped bi2212 high - t@xmath0 systems is almost the same .",

    "the results obtained further support the lda+dmft+@xmath54 to be an effective method to investigate the electronic structure of strongly - correlated systems .",

    "<S> material specific electronic band structure of the electron - doped high - t@xmath0 cuprate nd@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) is calculated within the pseudo gap regime , using the recently developed generalized lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> lda / dft ( density functional theory within local density approximation ) provides model parameters ( hopping integral values , local coulomb interaction strength ) for the one - band hubbard model , which is solved by dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory ) . to take into account pseudogap fluctuations lda+dmft </S>",
    "<S> is supplied with `` external '' @xmath5-dependent self - energy @xmath4 , which describes interaction of correlated conducting electrons with non - local heisenberg - like antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin fluctuations responsible for pseudo gap formation . within this lda+dmft+@xmath4 approach </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the formation of pronounced `` hot - spots '' on the fermi surface ( fs ) map in ncco , opposite to our recent calculations for bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( bi2212 ) , which have produced rather extended region of fs `` destruction '' . </S>",
    "<S> there are several physical reasons for this fact : ( i ) the `` hot - spots '' in ncco are located closer to brillouin zone center ; ( ii ) correlation length of afm fluctuations @xmath8 is larger for ncco ; ( iii ) pseudogap potential @xmath9 is stronger , than in bi2212 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our theoretical data with recent bulk sensitive high - energy angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) data for ncco provides good semiquantitative agreement . </S>",
    "<S> based on that comparison alternative explanation of the van - hove singularity at -0.3 ev is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> optical conductivity both for bi2212 and ncco is also calculated within lda+dmft+@xmath4 and compared with experimental results , demonstrating satisfactory agreement . </S>"
