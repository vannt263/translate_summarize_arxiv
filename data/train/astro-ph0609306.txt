    "the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission is believed to be mostly produced in interactions of cosmic rays with the matter and the radiation fields in the galaxy , the main production mechanisms being electron non - thermal bremsstrahlung , inverse compton scatterings off the radiation fields and pion decay processes in inelastic collisions of nuclei and matter .",
    "although the standard production mechanisms of @xmath0-rays @xcite explain generally well the spatial and energy distribution of the emission below 1 gev , the model does not match egret observations of the @xmath0-ray sky above 1 gev.@xcite the discrepancy between the model and the observations is more pronounced towards the direction of the inner galaxy , where it amounts to 60 per cent of the observed emission .",
    "many possible explanations have been proposed to account for the gev excess . @xcite",
    "have proposed an hardening of the cosmic ray proton spectrum .",
    "the average proton spectrum in the galaxy would have to be harder than locally measured .",
    "@xcite have suggested a renormalization of the electron spectrum in order to fit egret data . @xcite",
    "have argued that diffractive processes make the @xmath0-ray spectrum harder than the incident proton spectrum by  0.05 in power - law index , that the scaling violation produces more @xmath1 , and , that the inelastic @xmath2 cross section has a logarithmic increase with the incident proton energy , so that the combination of these effects could explain about 20 per cent of the `` gev excess '' .",
    "@xcite claimed that the features of the egret excess are consistent with the hypothesis of a signal from dark matter annihilation .",
    "recently @xcite has argued that the excess in the diffuse emission measured by egret and comptel could be explained by a combination of galactic source populations too dim to be detected by egret in addition to the standard production mechanisms .    in any case a major difficulty when studying the diffuse emission is to disantangle the truly diffuse emission from that produced by unresolved sources .    at tev energies ,",
    "milagro has observed diffuse emission from a large region of the galactic plane from galactic longitude @xmath3 of @xmath4 @xcite . the different theories to explain the gev excess",
    "make very different predictions about the tev flux .",
    "recently @xcite have argued that no strong signal of pion decay is seen in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the pion decay mechanism would not be able to explain the excess above 1 gev .",
    "therefore , @xcite claimed that the milagro measurements of the diffuse flux at higher energies revealed a new excess at tev energies and concluded that a different mechanism is required to explain the two excesses , either dark matter decay or contribution from unresolved egret sources .",
    "an extrapolation of the egret sources within the range in galactic longitude of the milagro observation overestimates the diffuse tev flux measured .",
    "however , there could be a population of sources undetectable by egret , but contributing to both the gev and tev excess diffuse emission .",
