    "heavy - quark physics has evolved into a new phase .",
    "charmonium - like states , which are known as xyz states   and quite possibly exotic ones , conventional bottomonia including the lowest - lying state @xmath0  @xcite , and heavy pentaquark states  @xcite have been newly reported by various experimental collaborations ( see also recent reviews  ) .",
    "these novel findings of heavy hadrons have renewed interest in heavy - quark spectra and have triggered subsequently a great deal of experimental and theoretical work ( see for example the following reviews  @xcite ) . among these newly observed heavy hadrons ,",
    "the conventional bottomonium @xmath1 is placed in a crucial position . even though it is the lowest - lying bottomonium ,",
    "it has been observed only very recently  @xcite and the precise measurement of its mass provides a subtle test for any theory about heavy quarkonia , based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical methods for the quarkonium spectra have been developed over decades ( see recent reviews  @xcite ) , among which the potential model has been widely used for describing properties of the quarkonia  @xcite .",
    "the form of the potential at short distances is governed by the coulomb - like interaction arising from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . in the lowest order ,",
    "one - gluon exchange between a heavy quark and a heavy anti - quark is responsible for this coulomb - like attraction  .",
    "the running coupling constant for the coulomb - like interaction was considered with higher order corrections in pqcd  @xcite .",
    "however , the distance of the quark and the anti - quark gets farther apart , certain nonperturbative contributions should be taken into account in the potential .",
    "quark confinement  @xcite is shown to be the most essential nonperturbative part obtained at least phenomenologically from the wilson loop for the heavy - quark potential , which rises linearly at large distances  @xcite .",
    "this linearly rising potential was extensively studied in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "there are yet another nonperturbative effects on the heavy - quark potential from instantons  @xcite , which are known to be one of the most important topological objects in describing the qcd vacuum .",
    "these instanton effects on the heavy - quark potential were already studied many years ago  , spin - dependent aspects of the heavy - quark potential being emphasized .",
    "the central part of the heavy - quark potential was first derived  @xcite , based on the instanton liquid model for the qcd vacuum  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the wilson loop was averaged in the instanton ensemble to get the heavy - quark potential , which rises almost linearly as the relative distance between the quark and the antiquark increases , then it starts to get saturated .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were also simulated in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "though the instanton vacuum does not explain quark confinement , it will play a certain role in describing the characteristics of the quarkonia .",
    "the feature of the instanton vacuum will be recapitulated briefly in the present work in the context of the quarkonium hyperfine mass splittings .    in this work",
    ", we will examine the instanton effects on the heavy - quark potential from the instanton vacuum , including the spin - dependent parts in addition to the central one .",
    "in fact , eichten and feinberg  @xcite derived an analytic form of the instanton contributions to the spin - dependent potential but were not able to compute them due to difficulties of deriving the static energy or the central static potential induced from instantons .",
    "diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite calculated this central part of the heavy - quark potential from the instanton vacuum , as mentioned previously .",
    "thus , in the present work , we want to obtain the instanton - induced spin - dependent parts of the heavy - quark potential , following closely refs .",
    "@xcite . to derive the spin - dependent potential from the instanton vacuum",
    ", we first expand the matter part of the qcd lagrangian for the heavy quark with respect to the inverse of a heavy - quark mass ( @xmath2 ) , as usually was done in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) . as was obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , the central part comes from the leading order in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "the heavy - quark propagator or the wilson loop being averaged over the instanton medium , the central part can be derived .",
    "the spin - dependent contributions arise from the order of @xmath3 .",
    "as we will show in this work , the heavy - quark propagator is given as an integral equation .",
    "expanding it in powers of @xmath3 , we are able to compute the spin - dependent part of the heavy - quark potential as was first shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we will evaluate these spin - dependent potentials and examine their behaviour .",
    "then we will proceed to compute the instanton effects on the hyperfine mass splittings of quarkonia . assuming that the interaction range between a heavy quark and a heavy anti - quark is smaller than the inter - instanton distance",
    ", we can easily deal with the effects of the instantons on the hyperfine mass splittings of the quarkonia .",
    "we find at least qualitatively that the instantons have definite effects on those of the charmonia , while those of the bottomonia acquire tiny effects from the instanton vacuum because of the heavier mass of the bottom quark .    the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section  [ sec : formalism ] ,",
    "we explain how to derive the instanton effects on the heavy - quark potential systematically .",
    "we first review the results of ref .",
    "@xcite within the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "then we show the corrections to the spin - dependent heavy - quark potential , which come from the @xmath3 order . in section  [",
    "sect : results ] we discuss the results of the instanton effects on the heavy - quark potential in detail and present numerical method used to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "we also present the spectrum low laying charmonium states and the estimates of the hyperfine mass splittings of these states . finally , in section  [ sect : summary ] we summarise the results and give a future outlook related to the present work .",
    "we start with the matter part of the qcd lagrangian for the heavy quark , given as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the covariant derivative , @xmath6 stands for the mass of the heavy quark , and @xmath7 represents the field corresponding to the heavy quark . as was done in hqet  @xcite , we assume that the heavy - quark mass @xmath6 goes to infinity with the velocity @xmath8 of the heavy quark fixed ( @xmath9 )",

    "in the instanton liquid model for the qcd vacuum , we have two important parameters , i.e. , the average size of the instanton @xmath108 and the average distance @xmath109 between instantons , as we have already mentioned .",
    "these numbers were first proposed by shuryak  @xcite within the instanton liquid model and were derived from @xmath110 by diakonov and petrov  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is also of great interest to look into the dependence of the heavy - quark potential from the instanton vacuum on these parameters .",
    "moreover , the values given above should not be considered as the exact ones .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite considered @xmath60 meson - loop contributions in the light - quark sector and found it necessesary to readjust the values of parameters as @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "lattice simulations of the instanton vacuum suggested @xmath113 and @xmath114  @xcite , which is almost the same as those with the @xmath60 meson - loop corrections .",
    "thus , we want to examine the dependence of the heavy - quark potential from the instanton vacuum on three different sets of parameters , that is , set i  @xcite , set iia  @xcite , and set iib  @xcite . the parameter dependence of the potential can be easily understood from the form of leading - order potential expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lo_pot ] ) .",
    "while the prefactor @xmath115 , which includes both the parameters , governs the overall strength of the potential , its range is dictated only by the instanton size @xmath116 through the dimensionless integral @xmath117 .",
    "when the quark - antiquark distance is smaller than the instanton size , i.e. , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , one can expand the dimensionless integral @xmath70 with respect to @xmath120 @xmath121x^{2}+\\left [ -\\frac{\\pi^3(438 + 7\\pi^2)}{30720}+\\frac{j_2(2\\pi)}{80}\\right]x^4+{\\cal               o}(x^{6 } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields the central potential in the form of a polynomial @xmath122 as the distance between the quark and the antiquark grows larger than the intstanton size , i.e. @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , we again get an analytic expression as follows @xmath125 -    \\frac{\\pi^2}{2x}+{\\cal o}(x^{-2})\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the central potential at large @xmath56 can be approximately written as @xmath126 the second term behaves like the coulomb - like potential .",
    "so , crudely speaking , this can be understood as a nonperturbative contribution to the perturbative one gluon exchange potential from the instanton vauum at large @xmath56 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath127 in eq.([eq : largex ] ) , which is defined as @xmath128 , could be regarded as a nonperturbative correction to the strong coupling constant @xmath129 .",
    "when @xmath56 goes to infinity @xmath130 , the potential is saturated at the value of @xmath131 . as discussed already in ref .",
    "@xcite , it implies that the instanton vacuum can not explain quark confinement . in the case of parameter",
    "set  i , which is often considered in the light - quark sector , the value of @xmath73 is obtained to be @xmath132 . however , if one chooses set  iia , then the result becomes @xmath133 .",
    "the set  iib produces @xmath134 .",
    "+    +    figure  [ fig2 ] draws @xmath56 dependence of each term of the heavy - quark potentials from the instanton vacuum .",
    "we take into account the charm quark sector as an example .",
    "we also show the dependence of each term of the potential on two different sets of parameters , that is , set  i and set  iib .",
    "one can see that the central part of the potential increases monotonically at small distances @xmath135 and later becomes almost linear at the distances comparable with the instanton size @xmath136 as already discussed in ref .  @xcite . at large @xmath137",
    "it starts to get saturated at the value @xmath138mev with set  i and @xmath139mev with set  iib .",
    "the spin - spin interaction part is of particular interest among these contributions to the spin - dependent potential . in pqcd , it is given as a point - like interaction  @xcite in the leading order .",
    "on the other hand , the spin - spin interaction from the instanton vacuum looks similar to a gaussian - type interaction .",
    "the spin - orbit potential behaves in a similar way to the spin - spin potential .",
    "the tensor interaction , however , shows a different @xmath56 dependence . as @xmath56 increases , the tensor potential vanishes at @xmath140 and then starts to increase until @xmath141 , from which it begins to fall off .",
    "the strength of each part of the potential become stronger when smaller value of @xmath142 is employed , since all terms turn out to be very sensitive to @xmath142 on account of the prefactor @xmath115 .",
    "it implies that a less dilute instanton medium yields stronger interactions between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the value of @xmath142 should not be continually decreased , because the whole framework of the instanton liquid model is based on the diluteness of the instanton medium where the packing parameter proportional to @xmath143 must be kept as a small parameter .    on the other hand",
    ", the change of the @xmath144 value seems less effective in the spin - dependent parts of the potential .",
    "this is again due to the fact that all spin dependent parts have the prefactor @xmath145 where instanton size appears in the first order , after rewriting the spin - dependent parts in terms of the dimensionless integral @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ dimint ] ) ) and its derivatives .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the average size of the instanton has a physical meaning of the renormalization scale  @xcite , which is a crucial virtue of the instanton liquid model .",
    "thus , @xmath146 indicates the renormalization scale @xmath147 .",
    "bearing in mind this meaning of @xmath144 , we should not take the value of @xmath144 freely .",
