    "we are thus confident that the extended , outermost emission detected in the irac 8 @xmath0 m images can be attributed to h@xmath1 , whereas some contribution of emission lines from ionized material can be expected in the innermost regions . the h@xmath1 emission in the pne in our sample is mostly associated to shell - like structures and its excitation may be two - fold as discussed below .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission is mostly associated to shell - like structures and its excitation may be two - fold as discussed below .",
    "the inner shell of ngc7048 is shock - excited @xcite , probably associated to the propagation of a small - velocity shock generated by the expansion of the inner shell into the outer shell .",
    "the emission of h@xmath1 in the inner shells of ngc6563 and ngc6772 may be similarly shock - excited , whereas the h@xmath1 emission from the outer shells of a66 , ngc6772 and ngc7048 seems to exhibit a dependence with `` openings '' in the inner shell that is suggestive of uv excitation .",
    "contrary to these nebulae , the spatial distributions of the h@xmath1 and irac 8  @xmath0 m emissions in the bipolar pne m2 - 48 , ngc650 - 51 , and ngc6537 , do not correlate closely .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission mainly traces the bipolar lobes of m2 - 48 and ngc6537 , but their irac 8  @xmath0 m images reveal bright emission at their cores , with faint emission from the bipolar lobes . in sharp contrast , the h@xmath1 emission of ngc650 - 51 traces its equatorial torus and knotty features in the bipolar lobes , but bright irac 8  @xmath0 m emission also arises from the bipolar lobes    the lack of _ spitzer _ irac observations does not allow us to study the relative spatial distributions of h@xmath1 and 8  @xmath0 m emission for m1 - 79 and ngc6778 . as for ngc6772 and ngc7048 ,",
    "the radial features of h@xmath1 emission seen in m1 - 79 are indicative of uv excitation and shielding effects",
    ". this may also be the case for the knotty appearance of the equatorial ring of ngc6778 seen in h@xmath1 .          the spatial correspondence between h@xmath1 and 8  @xmath0 m emission can be interpreted by the contribution of h@xmath1 emission lines into the irac 8  @xmath0 m bandpass .",
    "alternatively , the emission in this irac band may be attributed to thermal continuum emission from dust coexisting with molecular hydrogen .",
    "the spatial coincidence of molecular hydrogen and dust can have important consequences for the origin of the molecular material .",
    "the dust may act as a shield for h@xmath1 molecules from the ionizing uv radiation of the star , and thus dust and h@xmath1 may have been present in the nebulae since its formation .",
    "alternatively , the dust grains may act as catalyst for the formation of new h@xmath1 molecules on their surface .",
    "these phenomena have been studied by @xcite for ngc7293 ( helix nebula ) and for ngc6720 ( ring nebula ) .",
    "the survival of dense , dusty knots , formed during the agb phase within the ionized zone is critical for the origin of the molecular material @xcite .",
    "if the knots are able to survive a long time , then it can be expected that coeval h@xmath1 has survived shielded from the uv stellar radiation by the high density and relatively low temperature provided by the knots . however , if these dense knots are rapidly destroyed by uv radiation , then the h@xmath1 material detected in old pn should have condensated onto newly formed dust grains .",
    "the literature provides a wealth of observational evidence supporting the prevalence of h@xmath1 emission among bipolar pne with respect to other morphological types ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "bipolar pne seem to possess important reservoirs of molecular material , either because they descend from more massive progenitors and have therefore more massive envelopes , or either because the bipolar geometry provides a suitable haven for the survival of molecules in dense equatorial regions .",
    "furthermore , bipolar pne seem to offer suitable excitation conditions for the excitation and emission of the h@xmath1 molecule , may be through shock - excitation , but most likely by offering an appropriate flux of uv exciting photons as the h@xmath1 emission is associated in most cases to uv excitation @xcite .",
    "the quick evolution of the central star of a bipolar planetary nebula assuming it descends from a massive progenitor , implies it reaches the high effective temperature necessary to provide a suitable uv flux of photons in a short time - scale @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of post - agb speed evolution and nebular geometry may indeed play an important role , as bipolar pne that exhibit an equatorial ring structure have much stronger h@xmath1 emission than bipolar pne with a narrow waist @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of h@xmath1 emission among bipolar pne led to postulate the so - called _",
    "gatley s rule _ @xcite stating that `` the detection of the 2.122 @xmath0 m s(1 ) line of h@xmath1 is sufficient to determine the bipolar nature of a pn . ''",
    "this conclusion was based on the correlation between h@xmath1 detection and bipolar morphology of a sample of pne , although some of the pne in that sample exhibiting h@xmath1 emission are not strictly bipolar , i.e. , they do not show a butterfly morphology or bipolar lobes connected by an equatorial ring or a waist .",
    "for example , the physical structure of ngc6720 , the ring nebula , has been controverted and sometimes assumed to be bipolar , but a recent study by @xcite confirms the closed ellipsoidal shape of the inner shell proposed by @xcite .    the detection of h@xmath1 emission from pne in our sample with shell - like morphologies ( a66 , m2 - 51 , ngc6563 , ngc6772 , and ngc7048 ) seems to violate _ gatley s",
    "rule_. we concur that some of these pne can be described as ellipsoidal shells with bipolar extensions ( e.g. , m1 - 79 ) , or barrel - like structures with shorter extensions or _ ansae _ ( e.g. , ngc6563 and ngc7048 ) .",
    "the kinematical information available for some of them in the literature or in the spm catalogue @xcite , however , implies that m2 - 51 , ngc6563 , ngc6772 , and ngc7048 can not be described by no means as bipolar pne .",
    "similarly , the detection of h@xmath1 emission from haloes in a66 , ngc6563 , ngc6772 , and ngc7048 ( and probably some more in the literature , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not conform _ gatley s rule .",
    "_    even among the bipolar pne in our sample , we appreciate notable differences .",
    "sources that do not have an equatorial ring ( m2 - 48 and ngc6537 ) show bright 8  @xmath0 m emission at their cores , but the h@xmath1 emission arises mostly from the bipolar lobes . on the other hand , the h@xmath1 emission from sources with an equatorial ring ( ngc650 - 51 and ngc6778 ) originates from these equatorial regions . in these sources",
    ", we note that the h@xmath1 emission does not arise from a torus external to the ionized one , but from dense clumps or knots embedded within the ionized ring .",
    "this situation is similar to the h@xmath1 emission detected in ngc6720 and ngc7293 , and reminiscent of the knots that occupy the whole volume of the main nebula of ngc6853 @xcite or those that we detect in a66 .",
    "contrary to previous interpretations , the presence of a thick equatorial structure in bipolar pne does not imply h@xmath1 emission : such structures may provide a haven for the survival of hydrogen molecules , but at the same time uv radiation can not excite these molecules , and thus h@xmath1 emission is not produced . meanwhile",
    "the h@xmath1 emission from tori of bipolar pne seems to come from knots that shield themselves from the uv radiation of the central star .",
    "we have compared the emission detected in irac 8  @xmath0 m and near - ir h@xmath1 images to investigate the nature of the emission observed in this mid - ir irac band in a sample of pne .",
    "we confirm that a significant fraction of the irac 8  @xmath0 m emission can be attributed to h@xmath1 line emission , thus revealing the molecular nature of the material seen in these irac images .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission arises from inner shells and outer envelopes or haloes of round and elliptical pne , as well as from bipolar lobes and dense knots in the equatorial rings of bipolar pne .",
    "we found that h@xmath1 emission is not exclusively associated to bipolar pne , but objects with a barrel - like physical structure and their haloes have also important amounts of molecular hydrogen .",
    "we also suggest that the h@xmath1 emission from equatorial rings of bipolar pne arises from discrete knots , rather than from a photo - dissociation region just exterior to the ionized ring .",
