    "mission until the last recycling on od1443 , with one exception for the second - to - last recycling on od1440 , 1 week before the boil - off of the liquid @xmath1he in the large _ herschel _ cryostat tank .",
    "[ fig : recycling_nonnominal ] shows the temperature evolution which can be compared with the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recycling_temperatures ] .",
    "it can be noted that temp_ev exceeds 3.5k during the heating of the pump and that the `` knee '' at around 117min after thermally disconnecting the evaporator ( hse = 0 ) and closing the pump heater switch ( hsp ) is at 2k and not below . as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ sec : cooler_recycling ] , the finally achieved temp_ev in this step characterizes the efficiency of the recycling .",
    "this led to a 3.3h shorter cooler hold time than anticipated ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : holdtime_relation ] and table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] ) . due to a safety buffer of 3h taken into account by the science mission",
    "planning only 0.3h of pacs photometer observations were lost .",
    "the likely explanation for this behavior is that the remaining liquid @xmath1he film was broken or too thin so that the heat dissipation from the pump was not perfect .",
    "this is also reflected in the otherwise not observed bumps in temp_ts and temp_fpu_st at about 128min .",
    "this event was the only sign before the final boil - off , that the liquid @xmath1he reserve was close to its end .",
    "the liquid @xmath1he film recovered again for the next and final pacs cooler recycling on od1443 .",
    "* the pacs @xmath0he sorption cooler exceeded the required cooler hold time of 46h by at least 15h depending on the operational time of the pacs bolometer detectors .",
    "the biased time of the detectors is the essential parameter for the resulting hold time .",
    "we did not observe any sign of aging effect of the device , despite more than 9 years of operations , almost 4 of them in space .",
    "* an automatic cooler recycling procedure , assembling the necessary steps with the right timing , worked highly reproducible over the whole mission until the last cooler recycling 4 days before the liquid @xmath1he boil - off in the _ herschel _ cryostat .",
    "the only slightly non - nominal recycling with a 5% shorter hold time on od1440 can be explained by a disturbed thermal interface to the liquid @xmath1he bath 1 week before the boil - off . in total ,",
    "139 automatic pacs cooler recyclings and 100 automatic parallel ( with spire ) cooler recyclings were executed during the herschel mission . * the dependence of the cooler hold time on the detector operational time ( biased detectors ) was established early in the mission and worked reliably for the science mission planning process over the entire _ herschel _ mission .",
    "* we give a statistics of all pacs cooler recyclings over the full _ herschel _ mission . from this",
    "fine differences in the performance of the different modes and start conditions can be seen .",
    "parallel cooler recyclings starting with a warm cooler give an about 1h shorter hold time than pacs - only recyclings .",
    "cooler recyclings starting from a still cold cooler give an about 0.5h longer hold time than the warm start pacs - only recycling .",
    "* we characterize the cooler cycles into two main classes : ( 1 ) dip - type cycles starting at a slightly higher level ( @xmath41mk in evaporator temperature ) and , for the majority , ( 2 ) swell - type cycles starting at a slightly lower level and usually showing a temperature swell of 1mk after around 24h adjusting then to the level of the dip - type cycles .",
    "the physical reason for this `` swell '' is unclear , it appears to be a zero gravity effect .",
    "the `` dip - type '' shapes were also observed during ground tests of the device and seem to be the consequence of relative timing of evaporator temperature evolution and detector bias switching .",
    "we also noted a systematically slightly higher evaporator temperature level for parallel cooler cycles during the time interval of spire operations .",
    "illumination conditions of the detectors could be ruled out as negligible .",
    "* we investigated the cause for the dispersion of cooler hold times of cycles with similar biased time , same mode and start condition , which is in the order of about 1h . by determining",
    "a zero bias hold time , allowing a homogeneous comparison of all cycles , we have seen that the dispersion is caused by trends and different thermal loads into the pacs instrument along the _ herschel _ mission .",
    "this was concluded from the fact that the pacs optical bench temperature sensor showed a quite good anti - correlation both with regard to long term trends and short term scatter . a few outliers with noticeable shorter hold times",
    "can be related to a confined period between od101 and od132 early in the mission , when larger temperature load variations occurred . *",
    "the evolution of the cooler evaporator temperature during the individual cooler cycles was studied and the impact of the temperature variation on the bolometer response and hence the photometric accuracy during the biased times could be characterized very well and corrections improving the relative calibration accuracy were established as described in @xcite . *",
    "we sketch a method of @xmath1he mass content determination evaluating the temperature response of the @xmath1he coolant in the large _ herschel _ cryostat to the constant heat deposition of the @xmath0he sorption cooler pump at the end of the recycling process .",
    "this gave a much denser and hence robust against individual outliers coverage of the mass content curve for zero cost as an alternative to few dedicated direct liquid content measurements ( dlcm ) requiring the interrupt of the scientific operations .",
    "the accuracy of the method utilizing the anyhow performed cooler recyclings is solely limited by uncertainties in the adopted physical properties , like e.g.  the values of the specific heat capacities , and the start conditions , namely the initial superfluid @xmath1he mass in the tank at launch .",
