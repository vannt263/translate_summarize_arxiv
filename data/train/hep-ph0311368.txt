    "the transverse lattice formulation of gauge theories @xcite has been developed in recent years as a tool for hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "it has particularly been applied to phenomenological studies of pure glue and glueballs @xcite and mesons @xcite in the large @xmath0 limit on coarse lattices , in the context of the colour - dielectric expansion .",
    "more recently , as well as refinements of those studies @xcite , a number a new directions have been explored for the transverse lattice @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the basic structure common to all transverse lattice approaches . in spacetime",
    "we introduce a square lattice of spacing @xmath1 in the ` transverse ' directions @xmath2 and a continuum in the @xmath3 directions .",
    "the lightcone coordinates are @xmath4 and @xmath5 is treated as canonical time ; we use indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 gauge field degrees of freedom are represented by continuum hermitian gauge potentials @xmath9 and @xmath10 x @xmath10 link matrices @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and dirac fermions @xmath13 reside on the plane @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is associated with a link from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a unit vector in direction @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 goes from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "these variables map under transverse lattice gauge transformations @xmath21 as @xmath22 from these fields one can write down gauge invariant actions of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the continuum field strength in the @xmath25 planes at each @xmath16 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicates other gauge - invariant terms , typically at higher order in powers of the fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    if we allow only kinetic terms that are quadratic then , in the lightcone gauge @xmath30 , it is straightforward to formally derive the most general light - cone hamiltonian allowed for this system .",
    "one way to truncate this most general hamiltonian for practical applications is to work on coarse lattices , using the colour - dielectric expansion .",
    "this assumes the link variables @xmath28 are highly disordered and take values in the space of all complex matrices .",
    "this has the advantage that linearized variables are easy to quantize and hadrons are small in lattice units , but leads to complicated effective hamiltonians .",
    "alternatively , as the continuum limit @xmath31 is approached , the link variables are forced into the @xmath32 group manifold and all but a few terms in the action are irrelevant .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantize these non - linear variables and hadrons are large in lattice units .     compared to pion - nucleon drell - yan data .",
    "solid line : transverse lattice result evolved to @xmath33 gev .",
    "data points : e615 experiment @xcite .",
    "short - dashed line : na10 experiment fit to @xmath34 form @xcite . long - dashed line : na3 experiment fit to @xmath34 form @xcite .",
    "[ fig1],width=718 ]    recent work using the colour - dielectric expansion combined with dlcq has allowed realistic calculations of the structure of the pion at large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates of the lightcone hamiltonian are in the form of wavefunctions that can be directly related to many experimentally accessible observables ( modulo some possible problems with final state interactions @xcite ) . the structure function @xmath35 ,",
    "elastic form factor @xmath36 and distribution amplitude @xmath37 of the pion are in reasonable agreement with experimental data for even the simplest truncation of the colour - dielectric expansion .",
    "there is an interesting comparison of these results with other theoretical techniques discussed at this workshop .",
    "chiral quark models , which have an essentially structureless pion at low resolution scales , can produce even closer agreement with drell - yan data on @xmath35 ( see talk of ruiz arriola and ref .",
    "dyson - schwinger calculations are somewhat in disagreement with data , but seem more consistent with perturbative qcd arguments for the @xmath38 behaviour ( see talk of roberts and ref .",
    "it is important to clear up this discrepancy  who is right , if anyone ?    .",
    "solid curves are the transverse lattice result , gray curve for wavefunctions calculated within a one - link truncation , black curve for a three - link truncation .",
    "the experimental data points are from ref .",
    "[ fig2],width=718 ]    the corresponding distribution of valence quark helicity , _ i.e. _  projection of quark spin on the direction of motion of the fast - moving hadron , was calculated for the first time in the pion @xcite .",
    "it was found to have the same shape as @xmath39 but there is a large probability to find the quark and anti - quark helicities aligned with one another , which is completely different from the picture of the non - relativistic quark model . to investigate simultaneously the transverse and longitudinal structure one can use the impact parameter dependent parton distributions @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is impact parameter , that measure the probability of finding a quark with given bjorken @xmath42 and transverse position @xmath41 .",
    "these were calculated for the transverse lattice @xcite at particular lattice values of @xmath41 , and are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .    . , which sums over all impact parameters @xmath41 .",
    "( b)-(e ) the sum of contributions at impact parameters @xmath41 along lattice axes such that @xmath43 respectively .",
    "[ fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=718 ] +    this corresponds to a sharp fall - off of the hadron wavefunction in transverse space at a particular ( @xmath42-dependent ) radius .",
    "the talk of broniowski in these proceedings and ref .",
    "@xcite shows that chiral quark models predict something qualitatively similar .",
    "it should be possible to calculate this in the dyson - schwinger approach also .",
    "it is a challenge to extend this work to the baryons and other mesons .",
    "it the case of baryons , since large @xmath0 no longer restricts the number of quarks , one needs a suitable truncation of the fock space commensurate with the colour - dielectric expansion . in the case of mesons , one needs to understand particularly how the pion - rho splitting arises .",
    "the coarse lattice hamiltonian contains spin flip operators , involving link - field emission , that do split the pion and rho , and are presumably a consequence of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , but at the expense of also splitting the rho multiplet itself _ i.e. _",
    "breaking lorentz invariance .",
    "one needs further operators that improve both explicit chiral and lorentz symmetry .",
    "one possibility allowed is four - fermi interactions , since these are renormalisable with repsect to the two continuum dimensions @xmath44 .",
    "they have the potential to split the pion from the rho without splitting the rho iteslf @xcite .",
    "these would bring the transverse lattice wavefunctions to a form more closely resembling those of the chiral quark models ; in particular , they would not vanish at bjorken @xmath45 .",
    "as with other lattice formulations , the transverse lattice suffers from the fermion doubling problem . this has been recently studied in detail by chakrabarti _",
    "they find that with symmetric lattice derivatives , in the free field limit fermions on even and odd transverse lattice sites decouple . as a result",
    ", four species of fermions appear on the ( two - dimensional ) transverse lattice as excitations around zero transverse momentum .",
    "this is quite different from euclidean lattice theory , where doublers have at least one momentum component near the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "they propose a staggered fermion formulation on the lightfront transverse lattice that eliminates two of the species , with the other two interpreted as different flavours .",
    "previous coarse transverse lattice calculations have used wilson fermions , which also removes doublers @xcite .",
    "another possibility , discussed in ref.@xcite , is to use separate forward and backward derivatives . introducing the left and right moving components of the fermion field @xmath46",
    ", the transverse gauge kinetic term is @xmath47 where @xmath48 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ d_{r}^{\\rm b } \\psi ( { \\bf x } ) \\equiv { 1 \\over a } [ \\psi({\\bf x } ) -m_{r}^{\\dagger}({\\bf x}- a \\hat{\\bf r } ) \\psi({\\bf x}- a \\hat{\\bf r } ) ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the free field limit , for bare fermion mass @xmath49 with transverse momentum @xmath50 , this leads to an invariant mass @xmath51 @xmath52 only for the case @xmath53 and there is no doubling . ( the last term above occurs due to a helicity flip term in the hamiltonian ) .    in all the above cases",
    "the question of explicit chiral symmetry breaking arises ; the usual theorems lead one to expect it if doublers are removed .",
    "one must distinguish between conventional chiral transformations , which act on @xmath29 , and lightcone chiral transformations that act on the physical component @xmath54 only .",
    "it is often the case that the latter can be a symmetry even in theories that are obviously not chirally symmetric in the usual sense ( e.g. free massive fermions ) , and may even be useful for classifying hadrons in the quark model @xcite . how to check for conventional explicit chiral symmetry ?",
    "_ suggest an ` even - odd ' helicity flip transformation on the physical component @xmath55 that is always violated in the cases above . alternatively one might try to directly check conservation of the usual chiral current @xcite .",
    "conservation of the ` 1 + 1 ' current @xmath56 is a necessary condition for conservation of the four - dimensional current .",
    "one can not check @xmath57 directly because it contains a bad current @xmath58 that leads to normal - ordering ambiguities .",
    "suppose however we consider the vacuum - to - one - pseudoscalar - meson matrix element : @xmath59 the form of the rhs follows from exact 1 + 1 symmetries .",
    "@xmath60 implies that either @xmath61 or @xmath62 , depending on the meson .",
    "the first condition is the massless pion condition .",
    "in addition there are an infinite number of further conditions  excitations of the pion must have zero decay constant @xmath63 . by tuning irrelevant operators , for example within the colour - dielectric expansion",
    ", one might hope to gradually realise these conditions .",
    "other operators that improve lorentz symmetry might then gradually move the conditions towards sufficiency for chiral symmetry .",
    "this is an interesting idea yet to be attempted in practice .    some applications of the asymmetric derivatives to meson calculations appeared after the workshop @xcite .",
    "an interesting limit of transverse lattice gauge theory has been formulated by patel and ratabole @xcite , which is an analogue of the strong coupling limit in conventional lattice theories .",
    "they take the link - field @xmath28 in the @xmath8 group manifold , as in the continuum limit .",
    "@xmath28 can be totally disordered if one turns off all its gauge and self interactions and its kinetic term .",
    "provided the coupling to fermions is linear in @xmath28 , which is the case with the simplest lattice discretization of the wilson - dirac operator , the link field can be integrated out of the path integral exactly at large @xmath0 .",
    "this allows derivation of the effective action , quark propagator , chiral condensate , and a boundstate equation for mesons consisting of the t hooft equation modified by a meson transverse hopping via four - fermi interaction : @xmath64 \\phi(x ) & = & { 1 \\over 2x(1-x ) } \\left [ { m^2 - { g^2 \\over \\pi } \\over 2x } \\gamma^+ + x\\gamma^- + m + { g^2 \\gamma^+ \\over 2 \\pi x } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\int { dy \\over 2\\pi } \\left\\{g^2 { \\rm p } { \\gamma^+ \\phi(x ) \\gamma^+ \\over ( x - y)^2 } -{\\rm i}\\kappa^2 \\left[2\\phi(x ) + \\sum_{n=1}^{2 } \\gamma^n \\phi(x ) \\gamma^n \\right ] \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left[-\\left({{\\cal m}^2 \\over 2 } - { m^2 - { g^2 \\over \\pi }   \\over 2x}\\right ) \\gamma^+ -(1-x)\\gamma^- + m - { g^2 \\gamma^+ \\over 2 \\pi ( 1-x)}\\right ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation is for states of overall zero transverse momentum , @xmath49 is the bare mass , @xmath65 the longitudinal gauge coupling , @xmath66 the dirac hopping parameter on the lattice , and the wilson parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath68 in this case is a matrix in dirac space and covers all the possible spin structures of the quark anti - quark pair .",
    "this equation has yet to be solved in detail .",
    "a possible generalisation of this idea would treat the link fields @xmath28 as complex matrices , so that they are already disordered , and include also a potential @xmath69 $ ] localised on each link that does not propagate links in either transverse or longitudinal directions .",
    "integrating out the link variables would produce a class of generalisations of the t hooft model with transverse hopping .",
    "it is known that dlcq in 2 dimensions preserves supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "a recent attempt has been made to extend this to higher dimensions using a transverse lattice .",
    "of course , one may not expect to recover exact supersymmetry , but harada and pinsky @xcite have shown , using the sdlcq technique , that one may preserve half of an @xmath70 supersymmetry in @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "the fermion @xmath29 is now in the adjoint representation . in the lightcone susy algebra @xmath72",
    "they propose a charge @xmath73 that preserves gauge invariance , whose square defines the hamiltonian @xmath74 : @xmath75 @xmath76 ( in this case @xmath67 is the single transverse direction . ) the continuum limit @xmath31 of @xmath77 reproduces the correct super yang - mills result .",
    "the existence of @xmath73 ensures fermion - boson degeneracy in the massive spectrum , at least for @xmath78 , but the absence of a suitable gauge - invariant @xmath79 means that the number of massless states do not match .",
    "numerical diagonalisations of the lightcone hamiltonian problem exhibit interesting features , such as a winding mode spectrum around compact transverse directions that varies inversely with winding number .",
    "this seems to be a feature of the exact supersymmetry in this case since one might naively expect mass to increase with winding number , as the gauge strings get longer .",
    "it may be that the limit of small soft susy breaking gives a different result from working exactly at the susy point .",
    "it is well known in the context of the dlcq regulator , which makes @xmath80 periodic , that it is not possible to completely reach the lightcone gauge @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath80 zero mode of @xmath82 remains as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "in all explicit transverse lattice calculations performed so far , this zero mode has simply been dropped as a dynamical approximation .",
    "et al._have studied the inclusion of this zero mode in the formalism @xcite .",
    "the zero mode @xmath83 can be diagonalised in colour space by a residual gauge choice , then the link fields are expanded in eigen modes of the operator @xmath84 m_{r } ( { \\bf x})\\ ] ] the state space can then be written as a product of the action of the above eigen modes on a fock vacuum @xmath85 and normalisable functionals @xmath86 $ ] of classical functions @xmath87 .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this causes any substantive effect on physical observables compared to a calculation based on the fock vacuum @xmath85 alone with suitable renormalisation of couplings .",
