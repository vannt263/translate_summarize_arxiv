    "nowadays , one of the most important tasks in cosmology is to unveil the nature of the mechanism responsible for the current cosmic acceleration . from the observational viewpoint , the cosmological constant @xmath0 ,",
    "i.e. , the sum over the vacuum energy density of all fields in nature , remains as the favorite candidate for explaining this phenomenon , but because of its theoretical issues ( e.g. fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems  @xcite ) , many alternative mechanisms have been proposed ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .    among these ,",
    "a very light , minimally coupled scalar field @xmath1 whose evolution is driven by the slope of the potential @xmath2 and damped by the cosmic expansion @xmath3 according to the klein - gordon equation @xmath4 , is the most extensively studied dark energy case  @xcite . in terms of its potential or still of its equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath5",
    ", these dark energy fields can be broadly classified into two categories : thawing models whose eos increases from @xmath6 , as the field rolls down toward the minimum of its potential with @xmath7 and cooling scenarios in which an initial @xmath8 eos decreases to more negative values with @xmath9 .",
    "a special case of the latter is the so - called freezing models , in which the potential has a minimum at @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "examples of thawing - type scenarios are a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson @xmath11  @xcite and exponential potentials for dilaton fields @xmath12  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) whereas the freezing behavior is found in models of the type @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "distinguishing among these ( and other ) physical features of the dark energy potential from cosmological data constitutes an important approach to the cosmic acceleration problem , not only because it may indicate possible routes of solutions but also because it will reduce considerably the range of possibilities . in this",
    "regard , measurements of the cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift are coming up with the potential to improve current constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite , including the dark energy eos , the rms mass fluctuations , the matter density parameter , the total neutrino masses , etc .",
    "these data have the advantage of probing both the expansion rate and the growth of perturbations , thereby being complementary to other cosmological probes such as the comic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , observations of type ia supernovae and measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we investigate to what extent galaxy cluster number counts can be used to distinguish the thawing and freezing behaviors discussed above ( see also sec .",
    "ii ) as well as between these dynamical scenarios and the standard @xmath0cdm model . in our analysis",
    ", we consider the scalar field model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which admits both solutions from an appropriate choice of the model parameters . keeping the range of cosmological parameters within the allowed region by the current observations and considering two specific cluster surveys , namely erosita and spt",
    ", we calculate the number density of cluster and the redshift distribution of cluster number counts for this scenario and discuss the ability of these observations to distinguish between the thawing and freezing behaviors .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann - lamatre - robertson - walker universe driven by a non - relativistic matter which clusters under the action of gravity and a scalar field responsible for the current cosmic acceleration whose conservation equation takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are , respectively , the scalar field pressure and energy density and a dot denotes derivative with respect to time .",
    "the above equation can also be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the cosmological scale factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following _ ansatz _ on the scale factor derivative of the energy density was introduced : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are arbitrary parameters . when combined with the definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 mentioned above , eqs .",

    "it has been pointed out by the previous studies of this model that in the limit of @xmath27 the potential ( [ gpotential ] ) reproduces the exponential potential studied in refs .",
    "@xcite whereas for all values of @xmath28 , it is dominated by the quadratic contribution @xmath29 , admitting a wider range of solutions . once the form of potential is obtained , one can easily check the behavior of field evolution through the equation of state parameter [ wa ] w_(a ) = -1 + a^2 .",
    "an important point about the above _ ansatz _ ( [ ansatz ] ) is that with an appropriate choice of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath21 , one can obtain thawing and freezing behaviors for the eos parameter above , which will be essential for the cluster analysis discussed in sec .",
    "iv .      in order to obtain the allowed range of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", we perform a statistical analysis using recent cosmological data from type ia supernova ( sne ia )  @xcite .",
    "we also use cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite and large - scale structure ( lss ) data  @xcite to help break the degeneracy between the scalar field parameters and the matter density parameter @xmath30 .",
    "for sne ia data , we use the publicly available latest union2.1 compilation  @xcite which consists of 580 data points . for the cmb ,",
    "we use only the measurement of the cmb shift parameter  @xcite @xmath31 as measured by the plank collaboration @xcite , where @xmath32 .",
    "the lss information we use is the latest baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data set listed out in table iii of ref .",

    "( [ pr ] ) ] , the equation - of - state parameter @xmath35 lies necessarily in the interval [ -1,1 ] ( note also that for negative values of @xmath22 the potential @xmath2 becomes a complex quantity ) .",
    "therefore , we consider values of @xmath22 in the interval of [ 0 , 1 ] .",
    "our joint analysis of sne ia + cmb + bao data results into best - fit values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which is in full agreement with the standard @xmath0cdm model ( see fig .",
    "however , since our main goal is to discuss the influence of time evolving scalar field models on cluster counts , we will consider the 1@xmath39 interval for @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality to the subsequent analyses , from now on we particularize our study to the values of @xmath21 within the interval [ -0.3 , 0.3 ] and @xmath40 .    fig .",
    "( [ fig : wz]b ) shows the evolution of @xmath41 for some specific values of @xmath21 and @xmath40 . from the figure , one can easily observe that values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspond , respectively , to thawing and freezing behaviors of the scalar field model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of an increasing eos parameter ( thawing ) , the current cosmic acceleration is a transient phenomenon with the scalar field @xmath1 leading the universe to a future decelerated phase whereas in freezing scenarios , the field drives the universe to an eternal quasi - de sitter phase .",
    "assuming that cluster of galaxies are surrounded by a cold dark matter ( cdm ) halo we perform our analysis considering the abundance of cdm halos instead of cluster of galaxies .",
    "this cdm halo abundance is widely studied either through n - body simulation  @xcite or through a semi - analytical approach  @xcite .",
    "since our primary goal is to check to which level one can distinguish among the above mentioned scalar field models through the cluster number density , we adopt the semi - analytical approach of the spherical collapse model for our study of the structure formation .",
    "the main ingredients for studying the cluster number density are the critical density contrast @xmath44 at the collapse point , above which structure collapses , and the growth factor , @xmath45 . in order to calculate these quantities ,",
    "we assume that the dark matter and dark energy components are uncoupled ( except gravitationally ) and study the non - linear evolution of matter perturbation by adopting a spherically over - dense region of radius @xmath46 numerically .",

    "@xcite ) . from the previous results of @xmath65",
    ", we found that the homogeneous case shows slightly higher value than the inhomogeneous one in both freezing and thawing models .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this is an expected result since in the latter case there is an extra repulsive effect inside the cluster due to inhomogeneous dark energy which leads to lowering the linear density contrast .",

    "we discuss the results obtained from the studies of the cluster number density and the redshift distribution of cluster number counts per unit redshift for the thawing and freezing behaviors of the scalar field model discussed in sec .",

    "such a result can be understood in terms of the behavior of the eos for thawing models which evolve more closely to @xmath109 than freezing scenarios ( see fig .",

    "clusters are detected through the sunyev - zeldovich effect ( sz ) and x - ray flux surveys , via weak or strong lensing surveys and optical surveys .",
    "to relate the survey properties to the extent in mass and redshift space of the resulting cluster catalogue , it is necessary to link the mass and redshift of an individual cluster to the relevant observable , namely x - ray flux or sz flux .",
    "this is done through realistic scaling relations , which depends on the cluster physics as well as on the nature of surveys ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , since the limiting mass @xmath110 of any survey depends on the limiting flux of that particular survey . here",
