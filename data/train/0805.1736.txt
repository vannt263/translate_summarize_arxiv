    "forty years after the setup of the homestake experiment @xcite , the concept of neutrino oscillations is well established and generally accepted to explain the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite , and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments all made important contributions to our current knowledge of the neutrino sector .",
    "in particular , one finds that the measured maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) leptonic mixing matrix approximately displays the so - called tri - bimaximal pattern @xcite .",
    "this fact has triggered an overwhelming interest in non - abelian finite groups as means to explain the family structure of leptons and quarks .",
    "although differing in their details , all proposed models augment the standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry with a discrete symmetry .",
    "if this discrete symmetry  @xmath0 originates in a continuous gauge symmetry  @xmath1 which is spontaneously broken , one refers to it as a _ discrete gauge symmetry_. the assumption of a gauge origin has the advantage that the remnant discrete symmetry @xmath0 is protected against violations by quantum gravity effects  @xcite .",
    "we therefore require an underlying gauge symmetry of the form @xmath2 whenever a new gauge symmetry is added to the sm gauge group , it is necessary to verify that such an extension is anomaly free . with the above symmetry structure ,",
    "three new types of anomalies arise : - - g  , - g - g  , g - g - g  .",
    "the requirement of anomaly freedom at the level of the continuous gauge symmetry  @xmath1 results in the so - called _ discrete anomaly conditions _ after its breaking to the discrete symmetry  @xmath3 .",
    "ibez and ross  @xcite were the first to carry out a systematic study of these discrete anomaly conditions in the case of  @xmath4 breaking down to  @xmath5 .",
    "there the potential anomalies are    lllsu(3)_c - su(3)_c - u(1 ) ,   & su(2)_w - su(2)_w - u(1 ) ,   & --u(1 ) , + u(1)_y - u(1)_y - u(1 ) ,   & u(1)_y - u(1)-u(1 ) ,   & u(1)-u(1)-u(1 ) ,    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the standard model gauge groups .",
    "the investigation of their discrete versions revealed that the anomalies of the first row severely constrain the allowed anomaly - free discrete gauge symmetries . under the assumptions that the light fermions of the theory , i.e those particles which do not acquire a mass when the @xmath9 breaks down to @xmath10 , are solely the standard model particles , only a finite number of non - equivalent @xmath10 symmetries is possible  @xcite . adding three right - handed neutrinos to the light particle content , thus requiring pure dirac neutrinos , allows an infinity of anomaly - free discrete gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "an analogous systematic study of the discrete anomaly conditions for the case where  @xmath0 is a non - abelian finite group is still lacking .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to fill this gap and provide useful constraints on flavor models applying a non - abelian discrete symmetry .",
    "since there are only three chiral families in nature , any candidate finite family group  @xmath0 should have two- or three - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "this limits the possibilities to finite subgroups of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the groups @xmath14",
    "@xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18  @xcite , @xmath19  @xcite , and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the underlying family gauge symmetry @xmath21 must be non - abelian , the natural candidates being @xmath22 then , the potential anomalies are , see also  @xcite .",
    "notice that such an anomaly does not exist in our approach because there is no @xmath23 anomaly to begin with . ]",
    "g_f - g_f - u(1)_y  , g_f - g_f - g_f  , where the cubic anomaly is absent for @xmath24 .",
    "in order to formulate the discrete anomaly conditions , we first need to understand how the irreps @xmath25 of @xmath21 decompose into irreps @xmath26 of the finite subgroup @xmath0 .",
    "as this decomposition depends on the finite group and its underlying gauge group , one has to discuss each case separately .",
    "furthermore , since the quadratic and the cubic indices of the irreps of  @xmath21 enter the original anomaly conditions , it is necessary to introduce the concept of _ discrete indices _ for irreps of  @xmath0 .",
    "the following table summarizes our conventions and notation before and after the breaking of  @xmath21 into  @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this appendix we collect all the results of our study which are relevant for flavor model building .",
    "we tabulate the discrete indices for each finite group , now taking into account the constraints from the mass terms discussed in section  [ dacsect ] .",
    "thus some of the parameters of tables  [ tabpsl ] and  [ tabsum ] are fixed .",
    "others remain undetermined and the discrete anomaly conditions must be satisfied for arbitrary values . only in the case of @xmath16 the parameters @xmath27 with @xmath28 are additionally constrained by the condition @xmath29 . for the groups @xmath15 , @xmath30 , @xmath19 , and @xmath31 there are two inequivalent ways to assign discrete quadratic indices .",
    "therefore , anomaly freedom of the underlying continuous family symmetry @xmath21 requires that the anomaly conditions be satisfied for _ both _ of these choices separately . when calculating the discrete anomaly @xmath32 it is necessary to choose the normalization with @xmath33 .",
    "the first table shows the finite groups which are subgroups of @xmath11 only . therefore the discrete cubic anomaly provides a useful condition . in the second table",
    "we list the finite groups which can be considered as subgroups of @xmath34 as well .",
    "hence , the discrete cubic anomaly condition of @xmath35 is omitted , see section  [ dacsect ] .",
