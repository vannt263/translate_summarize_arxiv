    "while free quantum fields in de  sitter space ( ds@xmath2 ) have been well understood for some time ( see @xcite for scalar fields ) , interacting de  sitter quantum field theory continues to be a topic of much discussion . in particular , there has been significant interest in the possibility of large infrared ( ir ) effects in interacting de  sitter quantum field theories @xcite ) , both with and without dynamical gravity .",
    "most of these discussions have been in lorentzian signature , using some form of in - in perturbation theory .",
    "( see , e.g.  @xcite for early use of in - in perturbation theory in qft in curved space . )",
    "a popular choice is to choose the initial surface to be a cosmological horizon , so that the perturbation theory involves integrals over the region to the future of this horizon ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "this region of de  sitter space is also known as the expanding cosmological patch , the conformal patch , or the poincar patch .",
    "we will therefore refer to the associated perturbation scheme as the poincar in - in formalism , especially when the initial state is chosen to be the free bunch - davies ( i.e. , euclidean ) vacuum .",
    "and @xmath3 are the shaded regions .",
    "see section [ geom ] for details . ]    on the other hand , ir effects are often easier to control and analyze in euclidean signature de  sitter space , which is just the @xmath4-sphere @xmath5 .",
    "analytic continuation of such correlators to lorentz signature defines the so - called hartle - hawking vacuum of the theory @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 is compact means that no ir divergences can arise in perturbation theory unless they are already present at order zero . with appropriate techniques one",
    "can often analytically continue the resulting ir - finite euclidean correlators to lorentzian signature while maintaining control over the ir behavior .",
    "this was done in @xcite for massive scalar fields using standard perturbation theory . for massless scalars",
    ", @xcite used the euclidean setting to introduce a new form of perturbation theory which again yields ir - finite euclidean correlators whose continuation to lorentz signature can be controlled .",
    "one would therefore like to understand precisely how correlators analytically continued from euclidean signature are related to those computed using an intrinsically lorentz - signature technique . on general grounds",
    ", the analytically continued correlators will satisfy the lorentz - signature schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "so long as they satisfy appropriate positivity requirements to define a positive - definite hilbert space , this means that the analytically - continued ( hartle - hawking ) correlators define a valid state of the theory .",
    "recall that positivity will generally follow from the de  sitter analogue @xcite of reflection - positivity and the osterwalder - schrder construction , and that reflection positivity holds formally when the euclidean action is bounded below dimensions for standard kinetic terms and polynomial potentials ; see e.g. , @xcite . ] . in such cases , it remains only to ask how the hartle - hawking state relates to other states of interest , such as the state defined by in - in perturbation theory in the poincar patch .",
    "a hint was given by @xcite which studied a free scalar field but treated the mass term as a perturbation about the conformally - coupled value .",
    "the euclidean and poincar in - in formalisms were found to agree , and in fact to both give the exact result once all orders in perturbation theory had been included .",
    "( there are no uv divergences due to the fact that the theory has only quadratic terms and thus only tree diagrams . )",
    "this may at first seem surprising .",
    "indeed , for in - in perturbation theory defined using a cauchy surface at finite time as the initial surface , a result of this form would be impossible . since the past light cone of any external point of a feynman diagram is cut off by the initial surface ,",
    "all integrals are over regions of finite spacetime volume .",
    "furthermore , the volume of any such region would shrink to zero when the external point approaches the initial surface . as a result",
    ", the in - in correlators would necessarily approach the correlators of the zeroth - order theory as all arguments approach the initial slice . on the other hand , analytic continuation of euclidean correlators",
    "gives a de  sitter invariant interacting state that can not approach the zeroth - order state on any surface , so the two formalisms could not agree .",
    "in contrast , in the poincar in - in formalism the initial surface is a null cosmological horizon . in particular",
    ", it has the important property that there is an infinite volume of spacetime that lies both to the future of this surface and to the past of any given point in the interior of the poincar patch .",
    "this means that the integrals which compute perturbative corrections to the zeroth - order correlators need not become small as the arguments of correlators approach the initial surface and no contradiction with the euclidean formalism arises .    indeed , symmetry arguments suggest that this correspondence holds more generally . since both the free propagators and the poincar patch is invariant under translations , rotations , and dilations , the results of poincar in - in perturbation theory will be similarly invariant so long as all integrals converge .",
    "but for free fields on @xmath6 the only hadamard state which is invariant under these symmetries is the euclidean vacuum .",
    "one therefore expects a similar result to hold in perturbation theory , suggesting that the poincar in - in approach generally computes correlators in the interacting euclidean vacuum .",
    "an independent motivation comes from the work of gibbons and perry  @xcite , who pointed out that interacting euclidean field theory on @xmath5 describes thermal field theory inside the cosmological horizon of de sitter space ( i.e. , in the static patch ) with gibbons - hawking temperature  @xcite .",
    "while the euclidean formalism is commonly used to study thermal field theory , there is a lorentzian version called the schwinger - keldysh formalism  @xcite .",
    "this formalism agrees with what is usually called the in - in formalism in relativistic field theory if the property called _ factorization _ is satisfied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physical content of this property is that generic states thermalize if given sufficient time , so that one need not take particular care to prepare a thermal state so long as the initial state is taken to be sufficiently far in the past . since it is known that correlators in a wide class of states approach those of the euclidean vacuum at late times @xcite , it is reasonable to conjecture that the euclidean and in - in formalisms agree at least in the static patch of de sitter space .",
    "we argue below that the euclidean and poincar in - in approaches in fact agree for general interacting scalar field theories with @xmath0 .",
    "the argument can be sketched in three steps .",
    "step 1 is to relate the analytic continuation of euclidean correlators to in - in perturbation theory in the static patch of de  sitter .",
    "this amounts to checking that conditions are right for the usual relation between euclidean field theory and lorentz - signature thermal field theory , i.e. , factorization , to hold .",
    "step 2 is to note that , for position - space correlators with all arguments in the static patch , in - in perturbation theory is the same whether one thinks of it as perturbation theory in the static patch or as perturbation theory in the poincar patch .",
    "this follows from the well - known fact that in - in perturbation theory can be expressed in terms of integrals over the region that is i ) to the past of all external points of a feynman diagram and ii ) to the future of the initial surface ; see figure  [ fig : one ] . as a result ,",
    "analytic continuation from the euclidean reproduces poincar in - in calculations at least when the arguments are restricted to a single static patch . finally , step 3 is to show that both sets of correlators are appropriately analytic , so that their extension to the full spacetime is uniquely determined by their values in the static patch .",
    "we consider pauli - villars regulated correlators and show agreement at each value of the pauli - villars regulator masses .",
    "it follows that the fully renormalized correlators must agree as well .",
    "the bulk of this paper is devoted to the details of this argument and to providing some simple checks of the results .",
    "section [ prelim ] quickly reviews the relevant features of de  sitter geometry .",
    "section [ factorization ] then verifies that analytic continuation of euclidean correlators does indeed give in - in correlators in the static patch for massive scalar fields , while section [ analyticity ] argues that the correlators are sufficiently analytic so as to be determined by their restriction to the static patch .",
    "since the arguments are somewhat involved , we explicitly compute some simple in - in loop diagrams in section [ numerics ] and demonstrate agreement with euclidean results computed in @xcite .",
    "we close with some discussion in section [ disc ] . in an appendix",
    "we describe a more direct way for the analytic continuation of euclidean correlators , which gives a slightly different method for demonstrating their equivalence to poincar in - in correlators .",
    "this section serves to briefly review various features of both lorentzian and euclidean de sitter space , and to introduce notation and conventions . after discussing geometry and the relevant coordinate systems in section [ geom ] we review aspects of de sitter propagators in section [ prop ] .",
    "let us begin with euclidean de sitter space .",
    "as is well known , this is just the sphere @xmath5 . throughout this work",
    ", we set the de sitter length @xmath7 to @xmath8 and work on the unit sphere .",
    "we may thus describe @xmath5 using the metric @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the line element of the unit @xmath11 .",
    "it is useful to consider the complexified manifold @xmath12 , which may be thought of as the surface @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "wick rotations of various coordinates correspond to passing from one real section of @xmath12 to another , e.g. from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "one useful wick rotation is given by defining @xmath15 and taking @xmath16 real ; i.e. , by wick rotating the polar angle .",
    "this yields @xmath17 which is the metric of @xmath6 in so - called global coordinates .",
    "indeed , these coordinates are regular on all of @xmath6 . making a further coordinate transformation @xmath18 and writing @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath20 where the factor inside the parentheses is the metric on a piece of the einstein static universe . note",
    "that this piece extends only for a finite amount of einstein static universe time .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] is the corresponding carter - penrose diagram .    however , one may also arrive at the same real section @xmath6 by defining @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and taking @xmath23 real ; i.e. , by wick rotating the azimuthal angle .",
    "this yields @xmath24 with @xmath25 which is the metric of @xmath6 in so - called static coordinates .",
    "the coordinate range @xmath26 describes the static patch of de sitter .",
    "the coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 the boundary at @xmath31 is a coordinate singularity that coincides with the past and future cosmological horizons , @xmath32 , defined by the observer at @xmath33 ; see figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "surfaces ( schematically ) indicated by solid lines and @xmath34 surfaces by dashed lines . ]",
    "we will also make use of so - called poincar ( also known as conformally flat ) coordinates on @xmath6 in which the metric takes the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "these coordinates are related to the global ones via @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the expanding cosmological patch is the region @xmath39 with @xmath40 , which we also call the conformal or poincar patch . here",
    "@xmath41 is the ( past ) cosmological horizon defined by the observer at @xmath42 , which we take to coincide with the geodesic @xmath33 . with this convention",
    ", the poincar patch contains the static patch as shown in figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "we also take @xmath43 to coincide with both @xmath44 and @xmath45 on this geodesic .",
    "( thus , the variable @xmath46 runs backwards in time .",
    "it is more common to use the variable @xmath47 in the cosmology community . )",
    "the remaining relation between poincar coordinates and those discussed before is best summarized by using the concept of embedding coordinates .",
    "recall that @xmath6 can be defined as the locus of points @xmath13 in @xmath48 dimensional minkowski space . given two such points , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "one may treat them as vectors and compute the invariant minkowski scalar product @xmath51 , which gives a de sitter invariant measure of the separation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in",
    "the above coordinate systems one finds @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the angle between the @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the relevant @xmath54 .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath55 for @xmath56 or for points connected by a null geodesic , @xmath57 for points connected by a timelike geodesic , @xmath58 for points connected by a spacelike geodesic , and @xmath59 for points which can not be connected by any geodesic in real de sitter space .",
    "in the latter case , the points are not causally related ; see figure  [ fig : three ] .",
    "note that @xmath60 in the static patch .",
    "thus , if points @xmath49 and @xmath50 are in the static patch , then there is a geodesic connecting these two points .    on complex de sitter space we may take @xmath61 in static coordinates to write @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sin\\theta_x\\sin\\theta_y\\cos\\gamma^{d-2 } , \\label{invcs } \\ ] ] so that @xmath63     drawn with solid lines and spacelike geodesics from it drawn with dashed lines . ]",
    "consider two points @xmath64 on euclidean de sitter @xmath5 . in terms of @xmath51 , the scalar propagator on @xmath5",
    "is @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66.\\\\\\ ] ] here @xmath67 is gauss hypergeometric function : @xmath68    we will be interested in the analytic properties of ( [ sprop ] ) for general complex @xmath69 .",
    "the only singularities are branch points is even and if the scalar is conformally coupled and massless .",
    "] at @xmath55 and @xmath70 , and we take the branch cut to connect these points along the positive real axis",
    ". it will be particularly important to understand the singularity structure in terms of static coordinates ( [ staticg ] ) .",
    "careful inspection of ( [ invcs ] ) shows the following :    * observation*. the green s function for two points @xmath64 with static coordinates @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 is analytic for all complex @xmath74 except when @xmath75 is real modulo @xmath76 ( so that the two points lie on the same lorentz - signature real section ) and the two points obtained by replacing @xmath77 and @xmath78 by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , are causally related .",
    "( within this real section ) .    it will be useful to regulate the divergences of ( [ sprop ] ) at @xmath55 using pauli - villars subtractions both for the internal and external propagators so that all propagators become bounded functions of @xmath69 . because the unbounded nature of the external propagators needs to be taken into account only in the coincidence limit , where the vertex integral is convergent due to the small integration measure",
    ", it is in fact possible to show the equivalence of the poincar and euclidean formalisms regulating only the internal propagators .",
    "however , since analyzing such issues in detail would make the argument more cumbersome , we choose to regulate the external propagators as well .    for each @xmath81",
    "we define a regulated propagator @xmath82 } c_i \\delta_{m_i}(x , y),\\ ] ] where @xmath83 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the propagator ( [ sprop ] ) for a particle of mass @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are constants .",
    "we will always assume @xmath88 in units of the de sitter scale , so that in particular the masses @xmath86 correspond to principal series representations @xcite of the de sitter group .",
    "one may choose the coefficients @xmath87 so that @xmath89 has a well - defined finite limit as @xmath90 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for @xmath91 ) .",
    "for @xmath92 we have @xmath83=1 $ ] and one may take @xmath93 for any @xmath94 . for",
    "@xmath95 one may choose any @xmath96 which satisfy @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath89 is not analytic at @xmath55 .",
    "instead , @xmath55 remains a branch point analogous to that of the function @xmath99 or @xmath100 at @xmath101 .",
    "if desired , one can also make further subtractions to define regulated propagators with continuous ( and thus bounded ) derivatives to any specified order .",
    "such additional subtractions are useful in treating theories with derivative interactions , or for consideration of field - renormalization counter - terms .",
    "below , we will focus on non - derivative interactions for which the above subtractions will suffice .",
    "but it will be clear from the argument that the same results hold for derivative interactions so long as an appropriate number of additional pauli - villars subtractions have been made .    finally , it is useful to study @xmath102 at large @xmath103 .",
    "there , @xmath104 behaves either like @xmath105 ( for @xmath106 ) or @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) .",
    "hence for given choices of regulator parameters @xmath109 the modulus of the regularized propagator @xmath110 is bounded .",
    "it is useful to take each @xmath109 to be a given function of the smallest regulator mass @xmath1 , so that the regulator is removed as @xmath111 we may then take the bound on @xmath110 to be @xmath112 , determined only by @xmath113 and the lightest regulator mass @xmath1 .",
    "we now turn to step 1 of the argument sketched in the introduction .",
    "our task here is to show that the analytic continuation of euclidean correlators is equivalent to those computed using in - in perturbation theory ( defined using the propagator of the free euclidean vacuum ) in the so - called static patch of de sitter .",
    "this essentially amounts to checking that conditions are right for the usual relation between euclidean field theory and lorentz - signature thermal field theory to hold ; i.e. , that the hartle - hawking correlators are indeed thermal correlators in the static patch . at a formal level , this follows from the fact that correlation functions @xmath114 $ ] in the canonical ensemble are given by an imaginary - time path integral ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , in order not to miss any subtleties ( perhaps due to ir divergences of the sort predicted in @xcite ) and because of the many controversies surrounding ds quantum field theory , we will proceed slowly through an explicit perturbative argument .",
    "below , we consider diagrams using the pauli - villars regularized propagators ( [ dreg ] ) so that @xmath115 . we restrict attention to connected diagrams since",
    "vacuum bubbles are automatically excluded both in the euclidean and in - in formalisms . because the desired result is trivial for the diagram with two external points connected by a single propagator",
    ", we also exclude this diagram from our discussion .",
    "non - derivative interactions are assumed for simplicity , though the argument is readily extended to derivative interactions so long as additional pauli - villars subtractions are made as described in section [ prop ] above .",
    "recall that in static coordinates ( [ staticg ] ) points of de sitter space are labeled by a pair @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a point in the ( open ) northern hemisphere of @xmath118 .",
    "we will use these coordinates for both the static patch of lorentz - signature @xmath6 ( where @xmath119 and on euclidean - signature de sitter @xmath5 ( where @xmath120 . )",
    "we imagine that the integrals over the time coordinates @xmath121 of the internal vertices will be performed first , followed later by the integrals over @xmath122 .",
    "so for the moment we consider the @xmath122 to be fixed .",
    "we also assume that all internal vertices and external points correspond to distinct spatial points @xmath117 ; i.e. , @xmath123 for @xmath124 . due to our pauli - villars regularization",
    ", we can always recover information at coincidence by continuity .",
    "let us first review the general argument relating euclidean correlators to in - in correlators ( see e.g. @xcite ) using our de sitter static patch notation . in the euclidean approach the time integrals of the internal vertices are all from @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "the external points are taken to lie on this contour and , at least for the moment , we take them to all lie close to ( though not necessarily precisely at ) @xmath127 .",
    "since the @xmath122 are distinct , it follows from the observation of section [ prop ] that the integrand is analytic in all time coordinates @xmath121 in a region containing the contour of integration . thus the contour can be deformed .",
    "in fact , taking all internal coordinates @xmath121 to be integrated along the same contour @xmath128 , we note that the contour can be freely deformed so long as i ) it begins at some @xmath129 with @xmath130 real and ends at @xmath131 , ii ) the imaginary part of @xmath23 is strictly decreasing everywhere ( so that no two points on the path have the same value of @xmath132 ) and iii ) the path continues to pass through the external points .",
    "in particular , we are free to take the limit @xmath133 .",
    "now , these rules allow us to choose the contour @xmath134 to be as in figure  [ fig : four ] .        here",
    "@xmath135 is a nonzero positive number .",
    "the imaginary part is increasing infinitesimally on the horizontal portions of the contour .",
    "this is equivalent to using the feynman propagator when the two points are both on the upper horizontal portion and the dyson ( or anti - feynman ) propagator if the two points are both on the lower horizontal portion . in general , in the @xmath136 limit ( and where the imaginary parts of the times for all external points are also taken to zero ) , one may say that the above contour computes correlators using the free path - ordered two - point function as the propagator , just as occurs in the in - in formalism . furthermore , since all integrals converge after pauli - villars regularization , it is clear that the integral along @xmath137 is of order @xmath138 and can be neglected in the limit @xmath139 .    as a result",
    ", the euclidean correlators ( evaluated at @xmath127 ) agree with the corresponding in - in correlators in the static patch ( computed using the propagators of the free euclidean vacuum ) so long as a property called _ factorization _",
    "@xcite holds , which states that the @xmath140 pieces of the contour @xmath128 can be neglected in the @xmath141 limit .",
    "we now establish this property for our systems , diagram by diagram , we will refer to the associated diagrams below as feynman diagrams , even though they may sometimes involve dyson ( or other ) propagators as noted above . ] .",
    "for each feynman diagram , let us choose one external point @xmath142 and one internal point @xmath50 that lies on either segment @xmath143 or @xmath144 . to show that the integral of @xmath50 over the above segments can be neglected",
    ", we also choose a path through the diagram from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ; i.e. , a particular chain of propagators .",
    "now , recall from section [ prop ] that at fixed pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath1 all propagators are bounded by some @xmath112 . to establish a bound on the integrals",
    ", we may thus replace the integrand with its magnitude and replace all propagators _ not _ on the chosen path by @xmath112 .",
    "next consider the propagators on the chosen path .",
    "for at least one such propagator , external or internal , the ( static - patch ) time coordinates of its two arguments have real parts differing by at least @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the number of propagators in the chain . from ( [ magz ] ) and the asymptotics of the propagators discussed in section [ prop ] , this means that this propagator is of order @xmath147^{-\\nu}$ ] or smaller for some positive @xmath148 determined by the mass @xmath113 of the quantum fields , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the @xmath27-coordinates of the two arguments of this propagator , if @xmath151 is large enough . replacing all other propagators on this chain with @xmath112 ,",
    "we integrate the time coordinate @xmath152 of @xmath50 along the segments from @xmath153 to @xmath154 and from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "we also perform all other @xmath23-integrals at the vertices . the result",
    "is clearly bounded by @xmath157^{n_1}({t}_e - t_0)^{n_2}[\\cos \\theta_1 \\cos \\theta_2 e^{({t}_e - t_0)/k}]^{-\\nu }   \\label{bound}\\ ] ] for some constants @xmath158 , where the factors of @xmath159 come from the measure .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath158 are independent of the positions of all vertices , as well as @xmath130 .    to complete the argument",
    ", we divide the integrals over @xmath160 ( or , say , just @xmath149 if the 2nd point is external so that @xmath161 is fixed and independent of @xmath130 ) into two regions . in the first , we take @xmath162 .",
    "the bound in ( [ bound ] ) then shows that the integral over this region tends zero at least like @xmath163 as @xmath164 .",
    "the remaining region of integration is small since one of the variables to be integrated ( @xmath149 and/or @xmath150 ) satisfies @xmath165 and the integration measure @xmath166 contains a factor of @xmath167 .",
    "we note that the length of the interval on which @xmath27 is integrated is of order @xmath168 as well .",
    "we may therefore replace _ all _ propagators by the bound @xmath112 and find that the contribution from this region is again bounded by a number of the form @xmath169 , which of course tends to zero as @xmath164 .",
    "this establishes the fact that sections @xmath143 and @xmath144 can be neglected in the desired limit for any ( finite or infinitesimal ) choice of @xmath138 in figure  [ fig : four ] . in particular",
    ", this demonstrates the agreement of euclidean and static patch in - in correlators ( computed using the propagator of the free euclidean vacuum ) when the external points are located at @xmath127 .    to demonstrate agreement for more general external points , we need",
    "only analytically continue the correlators as a function of the time coordinates of the external points .",
    "this is in fact the _ definition _ of the euclidean correlators evaluated at more general times , and we will show that it also gives the static patch in - in correlators . for this step , it is convenient to take the external points to have distinct ( and fixed ) values of @xmath132 . at the end of the argument",
    "we will take the limit where all of these imaginary parts vanish .",
    "we first consider the analyticity of the integrand for some given diagram in the time coordinate @xmath170 of some external point with the time coordinates of all other points ( both internal and external ) held fixed and taken to lie on one of the contours @xmath128 discussed above .",
    "we also take the spatial coordinates of all points to be fixed and distinct . due to the observation of section [ prop ] , the singularities are then a finite distance from the contour @xmath128 . for example , for the original euclidean",
    "integral , if the external point with the time coordinate @xmath170 is connected to a vertex with time coordinate @xmath23 which is also connected to two other vertices , the singularities and associated branch cuts on the complex @xmath23-plane are similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : five ] .",
    "we may thus analytically continue @xmath170 to any complex value so long as we avoid the branch cuts .",
    "let us do so holding @xmath171 fixed and distinct from the imaginary parts of all other external time coordinates .",
    "then the only singularities which are of concern are those due to the vertex connected to @xmath170 with the same imaginary part of @xmath23 ; i.e. , for which @xmath172 .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : five ] , for a fixed contour @xmath128 this will in general allow only a finite range over which the integrand can be analytically continued in @xmath173 . however , as noted earlier , we are also free to further deform the contour .",
    "for example , by shifting the contour for all vertices a bit to the right at @xmath171 , we shift the allowed window for analytic continuation a bit to the right , and we do so without changing the size of this window .",
    "it is thus clear that , by dragging the contour along with the external point in this way , we may analytically continue the result of the time integrations to arbitrary values of @xmath173 for any given distinct set of spatial coordinates .",
    "but as before , our pauli - villars regularization scheme implies the same result holds for general spatial coordinates by continuity .",
    "it follows that the analytic continuation of euclidean correlators can be computed via the usual feynman diagrams associated with any contour which i ) begins at some @xmath174 with any real and positive @xmath138 ends at @xmath175 , ii ) has the imaginary part of @xmath23 strictly decreasing everywhere ( so that no two points on the path have the same value of @xmath132 ) and iii ) passes through all external points the reader may ask if the analytic continuation of a full diagram ( after all integrals , including space integrals , have been performed ) coincides with the result described above ( in which the integrand is first continued , before performing the spatial integrals ) . the potential obstacle is the fact that spatial coordinates will necessarily coincide somewhere during the integrals over space , and such coincidences shrink the windows ( used to enact the analytic continuation above ) between past- and future - branch cuts to zero size",

    "the exception is a finite piece near the minimum value of @xmath226 due to the use of effective past singularities in the modified contour deformation .",
    "since any internal point is connected by some chain of arrows to some external point , except for a set of finite - sized pieces as noted above , the projection of the integration region onto the real @xmath46-axis lies in the causal past of at least one external point",
    ". we will find it useful below to break up the integration region into such past light cones and finite - sized protruding segments .",
    "now we establish convergence using the modified deformation of contour .",
    "recall that each internal point @xmath219 is past - related to precisely one point @xmath137 ( see footnote [ tree ] ) , which may be either internal or external . also recall that , starting at any internal point , one may always follow a chain of arrows upwards until one arrives at an external point . as a result , deleting all dashed lines results in a set of disconnected subdiagrams for which each connected component is a tree whose root ( which in this case means that future - most point ) is an external point . as a result ,",

    "first consider the portion of @xmath246 noted above that protrudes from the past light cone of @xmath247 .",

    "we also find that @xmath252 , where @xmath253 and @xmath254 are some positive constants , on this portion of the contour .",
    "this is because @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the minimum of the real part of @xmath257 at @xmath258 , and that @xmath259 as @xmath260 .",

    "consider the part of its past light cone that is both within embedding distance @xmath242 and which also lies to the future of the cosmological horizon .",
    "this region is compact and thus has finite volume . since widening of the contour described above for large @xmath226 has little effect at large @xmath69 , for fixed @xmath138 , we may therefore choose @xmath242 large enough that the measure of the desired region in complex de sitter is within , say , a factor of @xmath267 of the volume of the region just discussed in real de sitter space .",
    "thus this part of our integral is easily bounded .",
    "we can similarly bound the contribution from the region @xmath243 .",
    "for large enough @xmath242 , this contribution is no more than , say , a factor of 2 times the integral of @xmath244 over the region of real de sitter space lying to the future of the cosmological horizon but more than an embedding distance @xmath242 to the past of the point @xmath268 . to proceed further",

    "we also note that the proper time difference between the two surfaces at @xmath269 and @xmath271 is @xmath272 for large @xmath269 . as a result , for large enough @xmath242 the contribution from the region @xmath273",

    ", we can bound the integral corresponding to any of the above tree diagrams by @xmath275 times the integral corresponding to the diagram shortened by cutting off a lowest line .",
    "we can clearly repeat this procedure and continue to remove the lowest lines until we are left with no lines at all .",
    "thus , the integral corresponding to each arrowed tree diagram is bounded by @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the number of lines in the given tree .",
    "hence the integral for the amplitude @xmath187 given by ( [ inina ] ) is ( absolutely ) convergent after translating the contours appropriately .      to complete the argument for equivalence between the euclidean and poincar in - in correlators",

    "for this purpose we introduce an additional regulator defined by some @xmath284 and show that the regulated correlators are analytic functions on @xmath285 .",

    "note that @xmath178 is indeed a regulator in the sense that it widens the gap between any pair of past and future singularities such as those shown in figures  [ fig : ten ] and [ fig : eleven ] . as a result ,",
    "any contour that can also be used to compute the unregulated @xmath280 can be used to compute @xmath290 for @xmath284 .",
    "thus , contours similar to figure  [ fig : nine ] are again allowed for @xmath291 .",
    "the ( absolute ) convergence of the integrals for @xmath290 can be established in exactly the same way as in the @xmath179 case .",
    "now consider complex @xmath292-derivatives of @xmath290 computed formally by differentiating the integrand , which is a product of propagators , and then integrating over the contours .",
    "our @xmath178-regularization makes the integrand analytic in an open neighborhood of @xmath293 with the contours fixed so that complex derivatives of the integrand are well - defined .",
    "furthermore , differentiated propagators are bounded at fixed @xmath178 and their behavior as @xmath294 is not worse than that of un - differentiated propagators .",
    "hence the argument for the ( absolute ) convergence of the integrals defining @xmath290 applies equally well to integrals of the differentiated integrands .",
    "but absolute convergence guarantees that these latter integrals do in fact give the complex @xmath292-derivatives of @xmath290 .",
    "it follows that such integrals are well - defined and that each @xmath290 is analytic in @xmath285 .",
    "now , since the integrals defining @xmath185 converge , it is clear that @xmath290 tends to @xmath185 as @xmath286 .",
    "as for the @xmath295-derivative of @xmath290 , the integrand will be divergent in the @xmath286 limit only where the arguments of the differentiated external ( regulated ) propagator , become coincident .",
    "however , due to our pauli - villars regularization this divergence is very mild and does not spoil absolute convergence .",
    "it follows that the @xmath295-derivative of @xmath290 has a finite limit as @xmath286 which gives the @xmath295-derivative of @xmath280 .",
    "in particular , these derivatives are well - defined on @xmath285 , so that @xmath280 is analytic in this domain .",
    "this completes our step 3 .",
    "let us now assemble the facts demonstrated above to establish the equivalence of the euclidean and poincar in - in correlators .",

    "one can perform essentially the same computations using pauli - villars regularization instead of dimensional regularization .",
    "note that the key steps above were the linearization formula ( [ eq : linearization ] ) , the property ( [ eq : muint ] ) of the form factor @xmath372 , and the composition rules ( [ eq : ians ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) . but it is clear from the derivation in @xcite that a similar linearization formula can be used to express the product of two pauli - villars regularized green s functions as an integral over ( un - regularized ) gegenbauer functions . in this case , the corresponding form factor @xmath373 is manifestly finite for all @xmath245 , but depends on the pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath1 .",

    "the euclidean pauli - villars computation proceeds in precisely the same way and again agrees after analytic continuation .",
    "finally , we note that the analogous 1-loop correction to the wightman function @xmath375 of this theory was recently considered by krotov and polyakov ( see  6 of @xcite ; the same correlation function is considered in  7 , but with respect to a different state ) .",
    "our result for this correlation function is simply the right - hand side of ( [ eq : phi3ininfinal ] ) with the replacement @xmath376 .",
    "it is difficult to compare these two results exactly because the result of @xcite has not been renormalized ( our renormalized result is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can safely compare the behavior of the two results in the infrared where the effect of renormalization is clear . to compare with @xcite we set all masses to be equal .",
    "using techniques presented in @xcite we find the leading behavior at large @xmath377 to be here @xmath378 and @xmath379 are the real , divergent , coefficients of the mass and field renormalization counterterms which cancel the divergent terms in @xmath380 .",
    "we find the same asymptotic dependence on @xmath381 as @xcite ; in particular , while the wightman function of the free theory has two asymptotic branches which decay like @xmath382 and @xmath383 , the @xmath363 correction has two asymptotic branches that each decay slower by a multiplicative factor of @xmath384 .",
    "the authors of @xcite interpret the appearance of the logarithm in the asymptotic behavior ( [ eq : polyakov ] ) as an indication of an `` infrared correction '' to the correlator . indeed",
    ", the logarithm indicates that the 1-loop correction induces an @xmath363 correction to the mass parameter @xmath334 ; as a result , the asymptotic expansion of the correlator is altered in perturbation theory like @xmath385 .",
    "the @xmath363 correction to @xmath334 can be computed by performing the sum over 1pi diagrams of the form of figure  [ fig:1loop ] ( b ) .",
    "this analysis was performed in detail @xcite .",
    "there it was found that , at least for scalar fields with bare masses belonging to the principal series of @xmath386 , the @xmath363 correction to @xmath334 has a finite negative real part ( equivalently , the correction introduces a finite negative imaginary part to the self - energy ) which can not be removed with a local hermitian counterterm .",
    "thus the @xmath363 correction unambiguously _",
    "increases _ the rate of decay of the 1pi - summed correlator so that this correlator decays _",
    "faster _ than any free wightman function .",
    "this agrees with the analogous computation in flat - space where the 1pi - summed correlator also enjoys an enhanced exponential rate of decay at large separations @xcite .",
    "we have shown that euclidean techniques and in - in perturbation theory on the poincar ( a.k.a .",
    "cosmological ) patch of de sitter yield identical correlation functions for scalar field theories with positive masses .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation for the in - in perturbation theory defined by global coordinates on de sitter , where the corresponding factorization property fails @xcite and the in - in scheme contains infra - red divergences .",
    "our equivalence holds diagram by diagram and for any finite value of appropriate pauli - villars regulator masses .",
    "it thus also holds for the fully renormalized diagrams .",
    "while we focussed on non - derivative interactions , interactions involving derivatives can be handled in precisely the same way so long as additional pauli - villars subtractions are made as described in section [ prop ] .",
    "we used a 3-step argument in the main text , though a more direct analytic continuation is described in appendix a.    as a check on the above arguments , we also explicitly calculated the one - loop propagator corrections due to both @xmath304 and @xmath303 interactions for all masses and in all dimensions in section [ numerics ] .",
    "the poincar in - in and euclidean calculations agreed precisely . for @xmath387 ( conformal coupling ) and also for the one - loop correction to the 4-point function for @xmath388 and @xmath389 ( also conformal coupling ) evaluated at two pairs of coincident points .",
    "both of these diagrams are finite and require no regularization .",
    "our numerics indicate agreement to at least one part in @xmath390 . as these calculations do not yield significant insights ,",
    "we have refrained from presenting the details .",
    "] we suspect that methods similar to those used in section [ numerics ] , perhaps combined with mellin - barnes techniques as in @xcite , could be used to give a rather direct diagram - by - diagram proof of the equivalence of euclidean and poincar in - in techniques , but we have not explored the details .    a number of points merit further discussion .",
    "first , some physicists have conjectured that in - in calculations in the poincar patch lead to ir divergences , even for fields with @xmath0 due to contributions with vertices at large conformal time @xmath46 .",
    "but there are clearly no such divergences in euclidean signature .",
    "so how can the two forms of perturbation theory agree diagram by diagram ?",
    "we believe that , if there are such divergences , they are better classified as ultra - violet ( uv ) divergences and are associated with the fact that the limit @xmath391 defines a null surface ( the cosmological horizon ) so that light - cone singularities can arise even at what appear to be large separations between points .    to a certain extent , the classification of these divergences as uv or ir in the cosmological patch may be a matter of semantics .",
    "what is important is that any divergences may be cancelled using only local counter - terms .",
    "this much is clear from our analysis : we have seen that adding a pauli - villars regulator @xmath392 removes all divergences , and that the in - in and euclidean calculations agree at all finite values of @xmath392 .",
    "this means that they have the same divergence structure in the limit @xmath393 , and that divergences can be removed using the same sets of counter - terms .",
    "but all divergences for massive theories on @xmath5 are clearly ultra - violet in nature and so are the same as on @xmath394 . local counter terms suffice to remove them .",
    "second , the reader will recall that the argument given in section  [ factorization ] to show factorization ( i.e. , that the vertical sections of the contour at infinite past may be neglected ) required the propagators to fall off at large timelike separations . without such fall - off",
    ", the two formalisms should not agree .",
    "instead , analytic continuation of the euclidean perturbation theory would give the terms of the in - in formalism , together with terms associated with integrals over some contour at infinity in the complex @xmath23-plane .",
    "how then should we interpret this disagreement ?",
    "if the propagators do not fall off at large times , then integrals over the contour at infinity will generally diverge .",
    "thus , one would expect at most one formalism to give finite results .",
    "let us suppose that the euclidean formalism is well - defined and finite . if one can establish the appropriate positivity properties , then analytic continuation will define a good quantum state . in this case , it would appear that any divergences of the in - in formalism are an unphysical artifact of this particular perturbative framework , and one might hope to better relate the two formalisms through an appropriate resummation of the divergent in - in formalism .    there is some potential for this scenario to hold in perturbative gravity .",
    "for example , the tree - level three - point correlator constructed by maldacena in @xcite in the momentum space is ir divergent when inverse fourier - transformed to position space .",
    "on the other hand , the three - point function constructed on @xmath5 using euclidean propagators would have no ir divergences ( see , e.g.  @xcite for @xmath91 ) .",
    "it may therefore be interesting to re - examine the three - point function in euclidean gravity . however , we note that some physicists have raised objections to these propagators  @xcite . in addition , at least with generic gauge choices the euclidean gravitational action is not bounded below ( though see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that one can not rely on osterwalder - schrder arguments  @xcite to guarantee that analytic continuation of the euclidean correlators defines a positive - definite hilbert space , and positivity would need to be verified .",
    "the other possibility when propagators do not fall off is that both forms of perturbation theory are ill - defined .",
    "this is the case for massless scalars on de sitter .",
    "but even here the divergences can be an artifact of the particular scheme for perturbation theory . in @xcite",
    ", rajaraman showed that , in the presence of a @xmath303 interaction with positive coefficient in the hamiltonian , the euclidean scheme can be resummed to give a new well - defined perturbation theory .",
    "since the euclidean action is bounded below , the resulting euclidean correlators will satisfy reflection - positivity and can be analytically continued to give a good state of the lorentzian theory .",
    "we close with a brief comment on other generalizations . recall that our first step was to verify that the usual connection between euclidean methods and thermal in - in field theory on a static spacetime holds in the context of the de sitter static patch .",
    "it is clear that similar arguments will hold in the static regions of generic spacetimes with bifurcate killing horizons , so long as the propagators again fall off sufficiently quickly at large separations .",
    "for a particularly amusing application , consider the standard minkowski space correlators ( in the minkowski vacuum ) for which the usual perturbation theory integrates the vertices of feynman diagrams over all of minkowski space .",
    "we now see that , so long as their arguments are taken to lie in , say , the right rindler wedge , these correlators can in fact be computed using in - in perturbation theory in the rindler wedge , and thus by integrating vertices of the in - in diagrams only over this rindler wedge .",
    "one would expect this fact to be well - known , but we have been unable to find any discussions in the literature .",

    "is that there is a continuous deformation from @xmath427 to @xmath414 such that no intermediate surfaces contain two distinct points satisfying ( [ app : zero ] ) that coincidence singularities do not spoil the analytic continuation argument here . ] .",
    "we note that , if the vector @xmath428 is timelike , then ( [ app : zero ] ) does not hold .",
    "first consider the following one - parameter family of surfaces : @xmath429 where @xmath430 is the same positive function as in ( [ app : s1 ] ) and where @xmath431 .",
    "note that @xmath432 .",
    "for any two points @xmath433 , @xmath434 , on @xmath435 , we have @xmath436 which is timelike if @xmath437 . if @xmath438 , then @xmath439 because @xmath440 and @xmath441 are both on the hyperboloid @xmath442 with @xmath443 .",
    "thus , the deformation of @xmath427 to @xmath444 leads to analytic continuation of the integral .",

    "we note that @xmath447 and @xmath448 .",
    "consider two points on @xmath449 : @xmath450 define @xmath451 , @xmath434 . since ( [ app : zero ] ) is invariant under multiplication of @xmath452 and @xmath3 by a common factor , it is not satisfied if @xmath453 is timelike .",
    "we find @xmath454 if @xmath138 is sufficiently small  recall @xmath455  then this vector is timelike for @xmath456 provided that at least one of them is nonzero and that @xmath437 . if @xmath457 , then we have @xmath458 because @xmath459 and @xmath460 are both on the hyperboloid @xmath461 .",

    "<S> we study the relation between two sets of correlators in interacting quantum field theory on de  sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> the first are correlators computed using in - in perturbation theory in the expanding cosmological patch of de  sitter space ( also known as the conformal patch , or the poincar patch ) , and for which the free propagators are taken to be those of the free euclidean vacuum . the second are correlators obtained by analytic continuation from euclidean de  sitter ; i.e. , they are correlators in the fully interacting hartle - hawking state . </S>",
    "<S> we give an analytic argument that these correlators coincide for interacting massive scalar fields with any @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify this result via direct calculation in simple examples . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence holds diagram by diagram , and at any finite value of an appropriate pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath1 . along the way </S>",
    "<S> , we note interesting connections between various prescriptions for perturbation theory in general static spacetimes with bifurcate killing horizons . </S>"
