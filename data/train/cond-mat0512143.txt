    "since the two seminal papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks @xcite , we have witnessed a considerable efforts devoted to characterization and understanding of complex networks , which describe many systems in nature and society . in the past few years",
    ", there has been a substantial amount of interest in network structure and function from a wide circle of researchers @xcite .",
    "one particular question that has attracted an exceptional amount of attention concerns the structure of networks that are evolving over time .",
    "a number of network models have been proposed , which convincingly reproduce some or all features of real - life systems @xcite .",
    "most of the precious models are stochastic @xcite . however , because of their advantages , deterministic networks have also received much attention  @xcite .",
    "first , the method of generating deterministic networks makes it easier to gain a visual understanding of how networks are shaped , and how do different vertices relate to each other ; moreover , deterministic networks allow to compute analytically their properties : degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average path length , diameter , betweenness , modularity and adjacency matrix whose eigenvalue spectrum characterizes the topology  @xcite .",
    "the first model for deterministic scare - free networks was proposed by barabsi _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite and was intensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . another elegant model , called pseudofractal scale - free web ( psw )  @xcite ,",
    "was introduced by dorogovtsev and mendes , and was extended by comellas _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on a similar idea of psw , jung _ et al .",
    "_ presented a class of recursive trees  @xcite . additionally , in order to discuss modularity , ravasz _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a hierarchical network model  @xcite , the exact scaling properties and extensive study of which were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , in relation to the problem of apollonian space - filing packing , andrade _ et al . _ introduced apollonian networks  @xcite which were also proposed by doye and massen in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been intensively investigated @xcite . except for above models ,",
    "deterministic networks can be created by various techniques : modification of some regular graphs  @xcite , addition and product of graphs  @xcite , edge iterations  @xcite and other mathematical methods as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as mentioned by barabsi _",
    ", it would be of major theoretical interest to construct deterministic models that lead to scale - free networks  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we do an extensive study on pseudofractal scale - free web  @xcite and the recursive graphs ( rg )  @xcite . in a simple recursive way we propose a general model for psw and rg by including a parameter , with psw and rg as particular cases of the present model .",
    "the deterministic construction of our model enables one to obtain the analytic solutions for some main structure properties : degree distribution , clustering coefficient and diameter . by adjusting the parameter",
    ", we can obtain a variety of scale - free networks .",
    "before introducing our networks we give the following definitions on a graph . the term _",
    "size _ refers to the number of edges in a graph .",
    "the number of vertices in a graph is called its _",
    "order_. when two vertices of a graph are connected by an edge , these vertices are said to be _ adjacent _ , and the edge is said to join them .",
    "complete graph _ is a graph in which all vertices are adjacent to one another .",
    "thus , in a complete graph , every possible edge is present .",
    "the complete graph with @xmath0 vertices is denoted as @xmath1 ( also referred in the literature as @xmath0-_clique _ ; see @xcite ) .",
    "two graphs are _",
    "isomorphic _ when the vertices of one can be relabeled to match the vertices of the other in a way that preserves adjacency .",
    "so all @xmath0-cliques are isomorphic to one another .",
    "the network is constructed in a recursive way .",
    "we denote the network after @xmath2 steps by @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ recursive ] ) .",
    "then the network at step @xmath2 is constructed as follows : for @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a complete graph @xmath7 ( or @xmath8-clique ) consist of @xmath9 @xmath0-cliques ) , and @xmath6 has @xmath9 vertices and @xmath10 edges . for @xmath11 , @xmath3",
    "is obtained from @xmath12 by adding @xmath13 new vertices for each of its existing subgraphs isomorphic to a @xmath0-clique , and each new vertex is connected to all the vertices of this subgraph . in the special case @xmath14 , it is reduced to the network described in ref .",
    "@xcite which is a generalization of pseudofractal scale - free web  @xcite .     and @xmath15 .",
    "only the first three steps are shown .",
    ", width=453 ]    let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the number of vertices and edges created at step @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "denote @xmath18 as the total number of @xmath0-cliques in the whole network at step @xmath2 .",
    "note that the addition of each new vertex leads to @xmath0 new @xmath0-cliques and @xmath0 new edges . by construction , we have @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus one can easily obtain @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "so the number of network vertices increases exponentially with time . from above results",

( [ gamma ] ) recovers the results previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient  @xcite @xmath59 of vertex @xmath33 is defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath60 that actually exist among the @xmath61 neighbors of vertex @xmath33 and its maximum possible value , @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of @xmath64 over all vertices in the graph .    for our networks ,",
    "the analytical expressions for clustering coefficient @xmath65 of the individual vertex with degree @xmath51 can be derived exactly .",
    "when a vertex is created it is connected to all the vertices of a @xmath0-clique whose vertices are completely interconnected .",
    "its degree and clustering coefficient are @xmath0 and 1 , respectively . in the following steps ,",
    "if its degree increases one by a newly created vertex connecting to it , then there must be @xmath38 existing neighbors of it attaching to the new vertex at the same time .",
    "thus for a vertex of degree @xmath51 , we have @xmath66 which depends on degree @xmath51 and @xmath0 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the @xmath65 is inversely proportional to degree .",
    "the scaling @xmath68 has been found for some network models  @xcite , and has also observed in several real - life networks  @xcite .    using eq .",

    "( [ ki ] ) is the degree of the vertices created at step @xmath72 .",
    "it can be easily proved that for arbitrary fixed @xmath13 , @xmath69 increases with @xmath0 , and that for arbitrary fixed @xmath0 , @xmath69 increases with @xmath13 . in the infinite network order limit ( @xmath73 ) , eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) converges to a nonzero value @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 , for @xmath14 , 2 , 3 and 4 , @xmath74 equal to 0.8000 , 0.8571 0.8889 and 0.9091 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath15 , for @xmath75 , 3 , 4 and 5 , @xmath74 are 0.8571 , 0.9100 , 0.9348 and 0.9490 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the clustering coefficient of our networks is very high .",
    "moreover , similarly to the degree exponent @xmath76 , clustering coefficient @xmath74 is determined by @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",

    ", the notations @xmath77 and @xmath78 express the integers obtained by rounding @xmath79 to the nearest integers towards infinity and minus infinity , respectively .",
    "now we compute the diameter of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( @xmath75 is a particular case that is treated separately ) :    _ step 0_. the diameter is @xmath82 .",
    "_ steps 1 to @xmath83_. in this case , the diameter is 2 , since any new vertex is by construction connected to a @xmath0-clique forming a @xmath8-clique , and since any @xmath8-clique during those steps contains at least @xmath84 ( @xmath0 even ) or @xmath84 + 1 ( @xmath0 odd ) vertices from the initial @xmath8-clique @xmath6 obtained after step 0 .",
    "hence , any two newly added vertices @xmath85 and @xmath86 will be connected respectively to sets @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the vertex set of @xmath6 ; however , since @xmath92 ( @xmath0 even ) and @xmath93 + 1 ( @xmath0 odd ) , where @xmath94 denotes the number of elements in set @xmath95 , we conclude that @xmath96 , and thus the diameter is 2 .",
    "_ steps @xmath84 to @xmath0_. in any of those steps , some newly added vertices might not share a neighbor in the original @xmath8-clique @xmath6 ; however , any newly added vertex is connected to at least one vertex of the initial @xmath8-clique @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the diameter is equal to 3 .",
    "_ further steps_. in order to simplify the analysis , we first note that it is unnecessary to look at all the vertices in the graph in order to find the diameter . in other words ,",
    "some vertices added at a given step can be ignored , because they do not increase the diameter from the previous step .",
    "these vertices are those that connect to vertices that already formed a @xmath8-clique in one or several of the previous steps : indeed , for these vertices we know that a similar construction has been done in previous steps , so we can ignore them for the computation of the diameter .",
    "let us call `` outer '' vertices the vertices which are connected to a @xmath0-clique that did not exist previously .",
    "clearly , at each step , the diameter depends on the distances between outer vertices .",
    "now , at any step @xmath97 , we note that an outer vertex can not be connected with two or more vertices that were created during the same step @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , by construction no two vertices that were created during a given step are neighbors , thus they can not be part of the same @xmath0-clique .",
    "therefore , for any step @xmath97 , some outer vertices are connected with vertices that appeared at pairwise different steps .",
    "thus , if @xmath99 denotes an outer vertex that was created at step @xmath2 , then @xmath99 is connected to vertices @xmath100s , @xmath101 , where all the @xmath33s are pairwise distinct .",
    "we conclude that @xmath99 is necessarily connected to a vertex that was created at a step @xmath102 .",
    "if we repeat this argument , then we obtain an upper bound on the distance from @xmath99 to the initial @xmath8-clique @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",
    "then , we see that @xmath99 is at distance at most @xmath105 from a vertex in @xmath3 .",
    "hence any two vertices @xmath99 and @xmath106 in @xmath6 lie at distance at most @xmath107 ; however , depending on @xmath108 , this distance can be reduced by 1 , since when @xmath109 , we know that two vertices created at step @xmath108 share at least a neighbor in @xmath6 . thus , when @xmath110 , @xmath111 , while when @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "one can see that these bounds can be reached by pairs of outer vertices created at step @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , those two vertices @xmath99 and @xmath106 share the property that they are connected to @xmath0 vertices that appeared respectively at steps @xmath114 .    based on the above arguments",
    ", one can easily see that for @xmath115 , the diameter increases by 2 every @xmath0 steps .",
    "more precisely , we have the following result , for any @xmath81 and @xmath11 ( when @xmath5 , the diameter is clearly equal to 1 ) : @xmath116 where @xmath117 if @xmath118 , and 1 otherwise . when @xmath2 gets large , @xmath119 , while @xmath120 , thus the diameter grows logarithmically with the number of vertices .    for @xmath75 ,",
    "the argument is similar : when @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath121 ) , the diameter is equal to 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) . now consider two outer vertices created at step @xmath122 , say @xmath99 and @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath99 is connected to two vertices , and one of them must have been created before or during step @xmath123 .",
    "we repeat this argument , and we end up with 2 cases : ( 1 ) @xmath124 is even . then , if we make @xmath13 `` jumps '' , from @xmath99 we arrive in @xmath125 , in which we can reach any @xmath106 by using an edge of @xmath125 and making @xmath13 jumps to @xmath106 in a similar way . thus @xmath126 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath127 is odd . in this case",
    "we can stop after @xmath13 jumps at @xmath128 , for which we now that the diameter is 2 , and make @xmath13 jumps in a similar way to reach @xmath106 . thus @xmath129 .",
    "as previously , it easily seen that the bound can be reached for some pairs of vertices .    hence , formally , @xmath130 for any @xmath23 . in this particular case ,",
    "the network order @xmath131 , thus @xmath132 also increases logarithmically with network order .",
    "in summary , we have proposed and studied a network model constructed in a recursive fashion . at each time step , each already existing @xmath0-clique generates @xmath13 new vertices .",
    "the process results in a serial of networks with two published papers  @xcite as special cases of them .",
    "we have obtained the analytical results for degree exponent , clustering coefficient and diameter .",
    "the degree exponent and the clustering coefficient may be adjusted to various values by tuning the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , they may perform well in mimicking a variety of scale - free networks in real world .",
    "moreover , in a similar way , one can easily consider other variations , for example , at each step not all cliques of a network but only some of them generate vertices , which also allow a rich structure and flexibility in the control of degree exponent , clustering coefficient and other properties . details of the analytical solution for these variants will be addressed elsewhere ."
