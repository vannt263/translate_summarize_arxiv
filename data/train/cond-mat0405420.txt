    "perturbation theory has proved very powerful for the investigation of problems which are not exactly solvable .",
    "thus , a number of different schemes have been developed which are either based on canonical transformations ( a well - known example is the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite ) or on projection technique @xcite . because of the increasing computer capacity one would like to perform such systematic perturbation expansions up to high orders by use of algebraic programmes .",
    "recently developed computer aided algorithms are based on the flow equation method @xcite and takahashi s formulation @xcite of standard perturbation theory .",
    "the latter approach was used to derive an effective spin hamiltonian for high - temperature superconductors @xcite , whereas the flow equation method has been applied to a number of low - dimensional systems , see e.g.  refs .  .",
    "however , the applicability of the flow equation method is restricted to cases for which the unperturbed hamiltonian has an equidistant eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "only then the involved set of differential flow equations can be integrated .",
    "recently , a systematic perturbation expansion for many - particle systems in terms of cumulants has been proposed by two of us @xcite .",
    "this method is an projection approach and is based on the construction of effective hamiltonians for low - energy properties . besides the automatically preserved size consistency of extensive variables , this cumulant method offers compact expressions for the different orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the main problem for the evaluation of cumulant expressions is to properly count the number of contributing configurations or diagrams to each order .",
    "however , since the counting of configurations can be taken over by the computer , the cumulant approach is an ideal starting point for an algebraic computer aided evaluation of physical quantities .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to demonstrate how these ideas can be put into practice .    for the sake of comparability , let us consider a dimerized and frustrated @xmath0 spin chain @xmath1 in the limit of strong dimerization .",

    "[ general ] so that the spectrum of the unperturbed part @xmath5 of the hamiltonian becomes non - equidistant .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the cumulant approach @xcite starts from the decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath10 into an unperturbed part @xmath5 and into a perturbation @xmath8 .",
    "the hilbert space of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath5 is split into two subspaces : the low - energy part @xmath11 and the high - energy part @xmath12 with projection operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us assume that the two subspaces are separated by a finite energy difference .",
    "it is our aim to construct an effective hamiltonian for the low - energy subspace @xmath11 .    motivated by the quantum statistical expression for the free energy , the effective hamiltonian for the subspace @xmath11",

    "that all states of the relevant @xmath11 subspace are degenerate with respect to @xmath5 , the resulting effective hamiltonian reads at temperature @xmath21 @xcite @xmath22^{n }      \\right)_{p}^{c }    \\right\\}.    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 is the liouville operator with respect to @xmath5 .",

    "we rewrite the cumulant expression by expanding the logarithm into powers of @xmath30 and perform the differentiations .",
    "we find the following decomposition of the generalized cumulants into operator products @xcite    @xmath31    thus , the calculation of cumulant expressions is reduced to the evaluation of sums over operator products which can be easily done by use of a computer .",
    "the main limitation for a concrete realization is given by the increasing number of convoluted sums .",
    "consequently , the numerical effort may be considerable , if additional restrictions have to be taken into account .",
    "in this section we show how the cumulant approach can be used to perform specific calculations . for this purpose",
    "we want to construct an effective hamiltonian for the dimerized and frustrated spin 1/2 chain in the limit of strong dimerization .",
    "as mentioned above , in this limit the unperturbed part @xmath5 of the hamiltonian describes isolated dimers without interaction between different dimers .",
    "therefore , the low - energy subspace @xmath11 is given by a single state which is a product state formed by singlets on all dimers .",
    "the low- and the high - energy subspaces are separated by the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath32 on a single dimer .",

    "the effective hamiltonian acting in @xmath11 can be directly identified with the ground - state energy of the complete problem , multiplied by the projector @xmath13 .",

    "it is favorable to exploit some additional restrictive conditions . in this way",
    "the number of contributions to the cumulants , which have to be calculated explicitly , can be considerably reduced .",
    "remember , the effective hamiltonian acts in the low - energy subspace @xmath11 which is formed by the product state of singulets on all dimers .",
    "it follows    * products of the @xmath27 operators inside the cumulant expression do not change the number of triplets , i.e. @xmath58 has to be fulfilled . * due to the explicit form of the excitation operators ( see tab .",

    "consequently , the cumulants of eq .",

    "otherwise no further evaluation is needed .",

    "it is obvious that steps ( a ) and ( b ) can easily be implemented by use of computer loops . for the calculation of the operator products of eq .   in step ( c ) , it is sufficient to consider finite clusters .",
    "the finite order contribution of a short - ranged perturbation is independent from the cluster size if the cluster is chosen large enough .",

    "the flow equation method can also be used to calculate excitation energies .",
    "the derivation of the cumulant expression for the effective hamiltonian @xmath95 was based on the assumption that it is acting in the lowest energy subspace @xmath96 of @xmath7 .",
    "this subspace can either be degenerate or nondegenerate . for the dimerized spin @xmath97 chain the lowest energy subspace is one - dimensional and is given by the product of all dimer singlet states .",
    "an example for a degenerate unperturbed groundstate was discussed in ref .  .",
    "note that the cumulant expression is also closely related to an effective hamiltonian which was derived by takahashi @xcite .",
    "there , the eigenvalue problem of the full hamiltonian is transformed to that of an effective hamiltonian which acts in a degenerate or nondegenerate energy subspace of @xmath7 . by comparing the perturbation expansion order by order with that of ref .",
    "@xcite the equivalence of both approaches can be shown .",
    "takahashi s approach does not involve the temperature .",
    "therefore , the subspace in which the effective hamiltonian acts is not necessarily the lowest energy subspace of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one might expect the cumulant result should also be valid for this case which would allow to calculate excitation energies .",
    "finally , a projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) for effective hamiltonians was recently introduced by two of the present authors @xcite . by using perturbation theory also in this approach @xcite a close relation to the cumulant expression can be found .",
