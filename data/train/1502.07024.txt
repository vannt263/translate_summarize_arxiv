    "a little over a decade ago it was advocated that the mass - size relation for massive galaxies ( @xmath10 ) had evolved little from @xmath11 to today ( trujillo et al .",
    "however this view was quickly challenged by daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who had detected seven passively evolving galaxies at @xmath12 , with stellar masses @xmath13 and morphologies typical of elliptical / early - type galaxies .",
    "they questioned the lack of evolution because some of their galaxies had much smaller effective half light radii than local elliptical galaxies of the same mass ( see also papovich et al .",
    "they suggested this difference was either a real sign of galaxy size evolution , or artificial because of biasing active galactic nuclei light or morphological @xmath14-corrections due to blue cores in the high-@xmath15 sample . addressing the latter uncertainty , kriek et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) found that nearly half of their distant massive galaxies had old stellar populations and van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2008 ) subsequently showed that half of those had sizes less than @xmath162 kpc .",
    "following daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , trujillo et al .",
    "( 2006a ) reported galaxy sizes ranging from 1 to 5 kpc for ten massive ( @xmath165@xmath17 ) galaxies at @xmath18 . from this trujillo",
    "( 2006a ) concluded that _",
    "( i ) _ the sizes were at least a factor of 3 to 6 times lower than `` the local counterparts '' of similar mass , _",
    "( ii ) _ the structural properties of these high-@xmath15 objects are therefore rapidly changing , _ ( iii ) _ the data disagree with a scenario where the more massive and passive galaxies are fully assembled by @xmath18 ( i.e.  a monolithic scenario ) , and _",
    "( iv ) _ they suggested that a dry merger scenario ( no new star formation ) was responsible for the subsequent evolution of these galaxies ( see also trujillo et al .  2007 ; toft et al .  2007 ;",
    "zirm et al .",
    "2007 ; buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; van dokkum et al .  2008",
    "; damjanov et al .",
    "2009 ) .    while not denying the occurrence of dry mergers , nor claiming that early - type galaxies had to have formed in a monolithic collapse ( see dekel & burkert 2014 and zolotov et al .",
    "2015 for an alternative ) , given the data under investigation we are questioning the universality of the above conclusions because they rest on the assumption as to what the `` local counterparts '' to the compact , massive high-@xmath15 galaxies actually are .",
    "popular opinion has been that these distant objects are very rare today ( e.g.  cimatti et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) , with trujillo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reporting a local number density of @xmath19 mpc@xmath5 , and taylor et al .",
    "( 2010 ) finding none and therefore concluding that the distant spheroidal stellar systems have experienced considerable size evolution to form today s massive elliptical galaxies . however , there are many independent lines of reasoning to think that this paradigm of early - type galaxy evolution may not be correct .",
    "key to much of this is that trujillo et al .",
    "( 2006a , b , 2007 ) used the sizes of @xmath20 _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( _ sdss _ , york et al .",
    "2000 ) early - type , i.e.  elliptical and lenticular , _ galaxies _ ( with srsic index @xmath21 ) , to claim that there has been significant size , and surface - mass density , evolution of the distant spheroids ( see also taylor et al .  2010 ; newman et al .",
    "2012 ; mclure et al .",
    "2013 ; damjanov et al .",
    "2014 ; fang et al .",
    "in addition to early - type galaxies , there is however another type of spheroidal stellar system in the local universe , namely the bulges of disk galaxies , including the lenticular galaxies .",
    "furthermore , there has been a slowly growing realization over the past three decades that most mag ) elliptical galaxies built via major dry merger events , and very faint dwarf elliptical galaxies . ]",
    "early - type galaxies infact consist of a bulge and a rotating stellar disk ( e.g.  carter 1987 ; capaccioli 1987 , 1990 ; nieto et al .  1988 ;",
    "donofrio et al .  1995 ; graham et al .",
    "1998 ; emsellem et al .  2011",
    "; scott et al .  2014 ) , arguing against the treatment of lenticular galaxies as single component systems .",
    "while many of these galaxies do not have massive bulges , and some contain pseudobulges built out of disk material ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; see also graham 2014 for cautionary remarks regarding their identification ) , our interest lies with some of the more massive lenticular and spiral galaxies that do have massive bulges .",
    "the most massive local bulges ( @xmath22 ) have sizes in excess of 2.5 kpc are therefore not considered `` compact '' ; as such they have been excluded from this study .    here",
    "we effectively explore what evolutionary conclusion might have been drawn a decade ago for the compact massive spheroids at @xmath23 if the size - mass comparison had of been performed with the massive bulges of present - day early - type disk galaxies rather than with the combined bulge+disk system . in so doing we can answer the question , have the high-@xmath15 spheroidal stellar systems truly evolved to near extinction , or are they perhaps hiding in plain sight around us today ? while we do not deny that there has been _ galaxy _ size evolution , we are suggesting a fundamentally different formation model which presents a dramatic shift in our way of thinking about how the compact massive objects at @xmath24 have actually evolved in our universe .",
    "it is such that they have not expanded 36 times in size , nor accreted , through dry minor mergers , a three - dimesnional ( 3d ) envelope of a similarly large dimension , to become today s massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ; carrasco et al .  2010 ;",
    "cimatti et al .  2012 ; fan et al .",
    "2013b , de et al .  2014 ) .",
    "instead , we advocate the view presented by graham ( 2013 ) that they have grown two - dimensional ( 2d ) planar disks and are thus effectively hidden today until bulge - to - disk decompositions are performed .",
    "it turns out that there are actually many reasons to favour this scenario .",
    "there is no widely accepted solution as to how the distant objects could have grown into much larger ` spheroids ' by today .",
    "for instance , major dry mergers can not account for the size evolution ; they move galaxies _ along _ the mass - size relation rather than off it ( e.g.  ciotti & van albada 2001 ; boylan - kolchin et al .  2006 ; see also bundy et al .",
    "2009 ; nipoti et al .  2009 ; nair et al .",
    "in addition , based on observations of galaxy pairs , there have been insufficient major ( i.e.  near equal mass ratio ) merger events to explain the removal of every distant , compact massive galaxy ( e.g.  man et al .",
    "2015 ; see also shih & stockton 2011 ) . similarly , there are not enough satellites observed around massive galaxies for minor mergers ( e.g.  khochfar & burkert 2006 ; maller et al .",
    "2006 ; naab et al .",
    "2009 ; hopkins et al .  2009 ; mclure et al .",
    "2013 ) to be the sole explanation ( trujillo 2013 , and references therein ) , and even in @xmath25cdm simulations there are not enough satellites to have transformed all of the distant spheroids .",
    "it is worth noting that ` normal - sized ' ( i.e.  not compact ) , massive elliptical - like galaxies _ are _ observed at these high - redshifts , co - existing with the ` compact ' , massive galaxies ( e.g.  trujillo et al .",
    "2006b ; mancini et al .",
    "2010 ; newman et al .  2010 ; bruce et al .  2012 ; ferreras et al .  2012 ; fan et al .",
    "furthermore , new galaxies are known to appear on the `` red sequence '' ( e.g.  bell et al .",

    "for example , carollo et al .  (",
    "2015 ) detail how past quenching can transform star - forming galaxies and shift them to the early - type sequence . known as ` progenitor bias ' , studies which attempt to measure the evolution of the massive quiescent galaxies ( e.g.  trujillo et al .  2006b ; ryan et al .",
    "2012 ; chang et al .  2013 ; van der wel et al .",
    "2014 ) can suffer from sample confusion because of the emerging population onto the red sequence ; such studies are effectively sampling different objects as a function of redshift .    in mid-2011 ,",
    "graham ( 2013 , see also driver et al .",
    "2013 ) suggested that some of the distant objects are likely to be the bulges of today s massive early - type disk galaxies .",
    "indeed , graham ( 2013 ) showed that the distant compact massive objects and massive local bulges occupy the same region in the size - mass and size - density diagram .",
    "dullo & graham ( 2013 ) additionally showed that they possess the same radial concentration of light , as traced by the srsic index ( srsic 1968 , see graham & driver 2005 for a modern review in english ) .",
    "moreover , massive bulges today are old .",
    "their mass ( not to be confused by their luminosity - weighted age ) is dominated by old stars ( macarthur et al .",
    "2009 ) and therefore such luminous bulges _ should _ be visible in images of the early universe .",
    "that is , some fraction of the compact massive objects reported at @xmath0 are expected to be today s compact massive bulges . by calculating the number density of compact massive bulges at @xmath26 , done for the first time in this work , we are able to address whether this fraction is low or instead if it might equal 1 and thus fully account for the fate of the distant compact massive objects .    rather than some great mystery of unexplained galaxy growth",
    ", we are exploring the relatively mundane alternative idea that daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and trujillo et al .",
    "( 2006a , b ) simply observed the bulges of today s bright early - type galaxies at high-@xmath15 but did not know it . to address this",
    ", we have performed a preliminary search for nearby ( @xmath27 mpc ) , early - type disk galaxies with bulges having @xmath1 kpc and @xmath28 .",
    "this was done by checking on the galaxies presented in a handful of published papers listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this proved to be sufficient to illustrate that compact , massive spheroids exist in substantial numbers around us today .",
    "section  2 of this paper presents the galaxies found , and the structural properties of their spheroidal component are also provided there .",
    "section  3 provides a general discussion of these findings and the growth of disks in our universe . section  4 finishes by re - iterating our main conclusions .",
    "five survey papers were consulted to check for the existence of compact massive bulges in the nearby universe .",
    "our criteria was that the stellar mass be greater than @xmath29 and the major - axis half - light radius be less than 2.5 kpc galaxies typically report the smaller , circularized half - light radii rather than the major - axis half - light radii .",
    "our approach is thus conservative . ] .",
    "the first paper we examined was dullo & graham ( 2013 ) which has already broached this topic , and the second was savorgnan et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) which has carefully modeled the different structural components for 66 galaxies from a sample of 75 ( graham & scott 2013 ; scott et al .",
    "2013 ) having directly measured black hole masses . building on this , we checked two samples dominated by lenticular galaxies . first we inspected the sample of 175 early - type disk galaxies modeled by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and then the atlas@xmath30 sample ( cappellari et al .  2011 ) of 260 nearby ( d @xmath31 42 mpc ) , predominantly northern hemisphere , early - type galaxies which have had the stellar bulge - to - total flux ratios derived by krajnovi et al .",
    "the fifth catalog paper that we inspected was the spiral dominated compendium of graham & worley ( 2008 ) , which resulted in the identification of targets in four additional papers ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . having checked these papers , our table  [ tab1 ] includes 20 known bulges along with the known compact massive _ galaxy _ ngc 1277 ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2012 ) , plus one additional _ galaxy _ , as opposed to a bulge , which also meets the above size and mass criteira .",
    "all but three of the 22 systems have @xmath32 kpc .",
    "all but 4 have @xmath33 .",
    "the major - axis , half - light radii of the spheroids are presented in table  [ tab1 ] , based on the galaxy distances which are also listed there .",
    "the circularized half - light radii would be even smaller , by a factor of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the minor - to - major axis ratio of the bulge .",
    "this information was not readily available for many of our bulges , and so we have used the more conservative , larger radii .",
    "the published srsic indices have additionally been collated and given in table  [ tab1 ] for ease of reference .",
    "our preference has been for near - infrared data sets because the magnitudes are more reliable : they are less affected by dust and possible low level star formation .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were then corrected for redshift dimming ( @xmath36 $ ] ) , foreground galactic extinction ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) , and @xmath14-corrected ( @xmath37 , poggianti 1997 ) which resulted in insignificant changes of typically 0.010.02 mag .    in the case of ngc  5493 ( krajnovi et al .",

    "this galaxy is not unique in the nearby universe .",
    "the intermediate - scale disk in ngc  1332 , which does not dominate at large radii like large - scale disks do , is such that the size of this _ galaxy _ is only slightly larger than 2 kpc ( savorgnan et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "however here we include the bulge rather than the galaxy parameters for ngc  1332 .",

    "2007 ) , yet it has biased luminosity - weighted age estimates in the past .",
    "such frostings of young stars , of up to 25 per cent by mass , can give the impression of positive luminosity - weighted age gradients , i.e.  bulges are younger at their centres , and have misled some studies ( which assumed a single stellar population ) into missing the fact that the bulk of the stellar mass in most bulges is old .",
    "this follows kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) who revealed that the obvious lenticular galaxies in the fornax cluster have ages which are younger than the more spheroid - dominated galaxies in the cluster .",
    "these works imply that the bulk of the stellar mass in today s massive bulges already existed at high redshifts , and therefore these stellar systems should be what we are observing in deep images of our young universe . curiously , saracco et al .",

    "furthermore , if a younger disk has formed , or bulges developed at different epochs , they may have different initial stellar mass functions ( imfs ) , resulting in differing composite imfs for the early - type galaxies today ( e.g.  dutton et al .",
    "2013 , mcdermid 2015 , and references therein ) .",
    "gradual stellar mass loss due to stellar winds is a part of the ageing process for passively evolving spheroids ( e.g.  de jager et al .",
    "1988 ; ciotti et al .  1991 ; jungwiert et al .",
    "2001 ) , as is the conversion of visible stars into dark remnants such as neutron stars and stellar mass black holes .",
    "if a fraction @xmath194 of the initial mass is lost from a galactic system due to stellar winds , or type ia supernovae clearing out gas , then there will be an adiabatic expansion because the galaxy is no longer as tightly bound and it will therefore reach a new equilibrium such that its size has increased by @xmath195 ( e.g.  jeans 1961 ; hills 1980 , their eq.6 ) .",
    "of course if any stellar ejecta remains in a galaxy  which seems likely in massive galaxies with strong potential wells ",
    ", perhaps eventually ending up as hot x - ray gas , then the expansion of the galaxy will be reduced depending on the radial expanse of this gas .",
    "after the young stars ( @xmath196 gyr ) have evolved , stellar winds likely account for just a @xmath19710% reduction to the stellar mass of the passive , compact massive galaxies seen at @xmath198 ( damjanov et al .",

    ". fan et al .",

    "of course if this had happened , then we would be left having to explain where all of the compact massive bulges in the universe today came from .",
    "given the smaller half - light radii that early - type _ galaxies _ had at higher redshifts , before they acquired their disks , the stellar densities within those half - light radii were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the stellar densities inside the half - light radii of today s large early - type galaxies .",

    "( 2008 ) claimed that within the inner 1 kpc of the high-@xmath15 galaxies , they have densities equal to globular clusters .",
    "this led them to advocate a scenario in which globular clusters and distant compact massive galaxies may have a similar origin , while at the same time suggesting that the more massive halos ( not the globular clusters ) started collapsing earlier and dragged along a larger amount of baryonic matter that later formed stars .",
    "however they overestimated the typical globular cluster size by a factor of 10/3 , and thus under - estimated a typical globular cluster s density by a factor of 37 , undermining their conclusions .",
    "bezanson et al .  (",
    "2009 ) showed that the inner regions ( @xmath196 kpc ) of today s early - type galaxies have stellar densities which are 23 times lower than those of the distant compact massive galaxies of the same mass .",
    "however , the majority of galaxies in our sample have bulge - to - total ratios of 1/21/4 ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , while laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found an average ratio of 1/4 for their sample of lenticular galaxies .",
    "that is , the local massive bulges are 24 times less massive than the galaxy within which they reside . in comparing _ galaxies _ of the same mass in figure  2d from bezanson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , one is effectively comparing the high redshift galaxies with local _ bulges _ that are 24 times less massive , possibly accounting for the lower density observed in these lower - mass bulges .",
    "if one compares the quiescent , compact massive galaxies at high - redshift with today s bulges of the same mass , one may find that they have the same density within the inner kpc .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported that there is no central ( @xmath196 kpc ) density mismatch ( see also van dokkum et al .",
    "they suggested that `` the entire population of compact , high - redshift red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high - density cores of present - day ellipticals '' , by which they mean spheroids .",
    "we however consider the evolution to have been very different , such that a 2d disk is built within and around the spheroid that undergoes no substantial size - evolution , rather than the continual development of a 3d envelope around a spheroid that effectively undergoes significant size growth .",
    "if there is indeed no evolution of the distant spheroids , then their velocity dispersion should remain the same .",
    "now , if a stellar disk builds within and around them , then the _ galaxy _ mass today will have increased . as a result , if one was to compare the velocity dispersions of the distant compact spheroids with the velocity dispersions of @xmath139 disk galaxies having the same total stellar mass , one would actually be sampling local bulges which are less massive than the distant spheroids .",
    "the local galaxies of the same mass , containing compact bulges of 24@xmath199 lower mass , are naturally expected to have _ lower _ velocity dispersions . indeed , this general behavior has been observed ( e.g.  cenarro & trujillo 2009 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2009 ; newman et al .",
    "if one assumes @xmath200 , then a 24@xmath199 difference in stellar mass will be associated with a @xmath161.21.4@xmath199 difference in velocity dispersion .",
    "if one attempts to bypass the photometric stellar mass estimate and use a dynamical / virial mass estimate ( @xmath201 ) for the lenticular galaxies , the same issue occurs .",
    "this is because of the enhanced @xmath202 value due to the presence of the disk component .",
    "if a galaxy s half - light radius is 36 times larger than the half - light radius of its central bulge , then the velocity dispersion of the bulge coupled with the galaxy size will produce a galaxy virial mass which is 36 times larger than what one would obtain for the bulge .",
    "this will act to artificially separate the compact high-@xmath15 spheroids from local massive bulges in a diagram of dynamical mass versus velocity dispersion . a note to keep in mind",
    "is that disk growth , as with envelope growth , may lead to the compression of the original inner bulge and a slight enhancement in the central velocity dispersion ( andredakis 1998 ; debattista et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the presence of partially depleted cores in massive spheroids is thought to be a result of major , dry merger events ( e.g.  begelman et al .  1980 ; faber et al .  1997 ; merritt et al .",
    "2007 ) . the large elliptical galaxies with sizes several times that of the high@xmath15 , compact massive spheroids , and with a deficit of stars over their inner tens of parsecs to a few hundred parsecs , likely formed this way .",
    "the orbital decay of the binary supermassive black hole , created by the galaxy merger , proceeds by slingshotting the central stars out of the core of the newly formed galaxy .",
    "however , as noted by dullo & graham ( 2013 ) , the presence of such partially depleted cores in the bulges of massive disk galaxies ( e.g.  dullo & graham 2013 ) presents a conundrum because these disk galaxies may be unlikely to have formed from such major merger events .",
    "one potential solution is that the bulges may have formed first , and the disks were subsequently accreted and grew ( graham 2013 ; driver et al .",
    ". it may therefore be interesting to check for partially depleted cores in the current sample of disk galaxies in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "application of the core - srsic model ( graham et al .",
    "2003 ) to _ hubble space telescope _ images  due to their superior spatial resolution over a sufficiently wide field of view  will reveal which bulges have an inner deficit of flux relative to the inward extrapolation of their outer srsic light profile .",
    "knowledge of which bulges have partially depleted cores , coupled with information about their stellar age , should shed even further light on the formation history .",
    "surveying predominantly compact , passive , spheroidal galaxies at @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , cimatti et al .",
    "( 2008 , see van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 for higher redshifts and higher masses ) noted that the galaxy sizes are typically such that @xmath206 kpc , and are thus much smaller than early - type galaxies of comparable mass in the present - day universe .",
    "however , the bulges of most disk galaxies at @xmath207 have compact sizes with @xmath1 kpc and many bulges with @xmath205 have @xmath206 kpc ( e.g.  graham & worley 2008 ; graham 2013 , his figure  1 ) .",
    "the growth of disks in and around the compact , high-@xmath15 spheroids could therefore explain their apparent disappearance by today .",
    "this possible explanation may at first glance appear somewhat at odds with the claim in the interesting paper by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that disk models , in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around them , can be ruled out .",
    "however the first distinction in these two remarks is of course that disks do not simply form around spheroids but are additionally embedded within them ; which is why bulge / disk decompositions continue the disk all the way into the centers of galaxies .",
    "it would therefore be of interest to perform a bulge / disk decomposition of the average surface density profiles , at different redshift intervals , that were constructed by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2013 , their figure  3 ) .",
    "this would allow one to check how well their @xmath190 ( milky way)-like galaxy profile that they built resembles the milky way , and thus to know if their stacked profiles are reliable or perhaps effected by dust or some other issue profile is at odds with ( milky way)-like disk galaxies , and the high average srsic index ( @xmath208 ) also suggests that their average profile is not representative of ( milky way)-like galaxies , but rather an intermediate - luminosity early - type galaxy which have a very different bulge - to - total mass ratio . ] .",
    "a reliable decomposition of an evolving population ( free from ` progenitor bias ' ) would of course enable one to quantify how much the disk and bulge ( including pseudobulge ) components have changed between the different redshifts .",
    "the second point of distinction is that van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2013 ) were referring to the inner 2 kpc radius of ( milky way)-mass spiral galaxies , rather than @xmath209 mass galaxies .",
    "the milky way has a bulge mass of @xmath210 and a bulge - to - total stellar mass ratio of 0.15 ( licquia et al .",
    "2014 ) ; it also has a half - light radius of 0.66 kpc ( graham & driver 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , within an inner radius of 2 kpc , the mass of ( milky way)-like galaxies are dominated by the disk rather than the bulge . due to the greater prominence of bulges in early - type disk galaxies than in late - type disk galaxies ( see figure  21 in graham 2001 ) , the inner regions of today s massive galaxies  which host the once distant , compact massive spheroids  are expected to have changed less over time , as already observed by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2010 , their figure  6 ) .    within the bulge - then - disk growth scenario , the existence of the distant massive spheroids having @xmath211 implies that local galaxies with bulges having @xmath211 need not be pseudobulges formed from the secular evolution of a stellar disk .",
    "this topic is reviewed in graham ( 2013 , 2014 ) where it is noted that bulges with srsic @xmath211 need not be pseudobulges even if they are also rotating ( e.g.  eliche - moral et al .",
    "2011 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "2011 ; keselman & nusser 2012 ; saha et al .",
    "2012 ; dos anjos & da silva 2013 ; graham 2014 ; querejeta et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in passing we remark that formation paths in galaxy clusters in which the disks of spiral galaxies fade and lose their pattern , and possibly end up with relatively brighter bulges ( e.g.  johnston et al .",
    "2012 , and references therein ) , to become lenticular galaxies can still operate .",
    "that is , lenticular galaxies likely have more than one evolutionary path , as can their bulges ( e.g.  cole et al .",
    "2000 ; springel et al .  2005 ) , and the presence of both classical and pseudobulges in the same lenticular galaxy would seem to support this ( e.g.  erwin et al .",
    "2003 ) . at the same time",
    ", the preservation , i.e.  the lack of evolution , of compact massive spheroids from @xmath177 until today has implications for studies of the evolution of the ( black hole)-bulge mass scaling relations ( reviewed in graham 2015 , and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath212 ratio would not be expected to decrease in these particular systems since @xmath213 .",
    "mclure et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported that @xmath214% of their @xmath215 sample of relatively passive galaxies ( specific star formation rate , ssfr @xmath216 gyr@xmath102 ) with @xmath217 have a disk - like morphology . while at face value this claim may appear to support the notion that flattened 2d disks",
    "have developed , their morphological ( disk - like ) claim was based on a srsic index divide at @xmath203 such that they labeled galaxies with @xmath218 to be late - type galaxies .",
    "they adopted this divide because shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) had used it to separate the bright , local galaxy population .",
    "shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) could do this because their _ sdss _ sample contained relatively few dwarf early - type galaxies which have @xmath218 .",
    "however bulges can have @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , some / many ( ? ) of the galaxies in the sample of mclure et al .  ( 2013 ) with @xmath218 may still be rather `` naked bulges '' , rather than disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "indeed , the similar distributions for their passive sample with @xmath218 and @xmath219 in the size - mass diagram ( their figure  8) would suggest this .",
    "the practice of considering all high-@xmath15 , compact , massive objects to be disk galaxies if their srsic index is less than 22.5 is unfortunately rather common ( e.g.  hathi et al .",
    "2008 ; fathi et al .  2012 ; chevance et al .  2012 ; muzzin et al .",
    "2012 ) and may have effectively mis - led many researchers .",
    "for this reason we have provided this cautionary text against this practice .",
    "the compact massive galaxies at redshifts @xmath220 have similar stellar masses and sizes ( and thus stellar densities ) , and radial concentrations of light , as bright bulges in local disk galaxies .",
    "moreover , the number density is not different by hundreds or thousands but is within a factor of a few .",
    "we have identified 21 compact ( @xmath1 kpc ) , massive ( @xmath221 ) spheroids within 90 mpc , giving a number density of @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 ( or 3.5@xmath6 mpc@xmath5 per unit dex in stellar mass ) .",
    "this is however a lower limit because we have not performed a volume - limited search .",
    "based on a sub - sample taken from a smaller volume - limited sample , this density may be 2.75(@xmath137% ) times higher at around @xmath152 mpc@xmath5 dex@xmath102 .    this observation eliminates the need to grow all of the high-@xmath15 compact massive spheroids by a factor of 3 to 6 by @xmath190 , a challenge which had remained unexplained for the past decade .",
    "rather , many of these high-@xmath15 spheroids need to remain largely unchanged in order to match the massive bulges in today s early - type disk galaxies .",
    "therefore , any study which may have claimed to have accounted for the size growth of quiescent galaxies would have inadvertently , and most likely unknowingly , introduced an equally puzzling problem .",
    "if all the distant , compact massive spheroids had evolved , we would then be faced with a second unexplained mystery , namely , where did the compact massive bulges in the local universe come from and why are they not observed in deep images of the @xmath222 universe .",
    "we conclude that stellar disks have since grown around many compact massive spheroids observed at @xmath222 and in so doing transformed their morphological type from elliptical to early - type disk galaxy ( i.e.  lenticular galaxies and early - type spiral galaxies ) .",
    "following graham ( 2013 ) , we again speculate that some of the less massive compact spheroids at high - redshifts may now reside at the centres of late - type spiral galaxies , and/or are today s compact dwarf elliptical galaxies - which were either largely stripped of their disk or never acquired one .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> it has been widely remarked that compact , massive , elliptical - like galaxies are abundant at high redshifts but exceedingly rare in the universe today , implying significant evolution such that their sizes at @xmath0 have increased by factors of 3 to 6 to become today s massive elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these claims have been based on studies which measured the half - light radii of galaxies as though they are all single component systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we identify 21 spheroidal stellar systems within 90 mpc that have half - light , major - axis radii @xmath1 kpc , stellar masses @xmath2 , and srsic indices typically around a value of @xmath3 to 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this abundance of compact , massive spheroids in our own backyard  with a number density of @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 ( or 3.5@xmath6 mpc@xmath5 per unit dex in stellar mass )  and with the same physical properties as the high - redshift galaxies , had been over - looked because they are encased in stellar disks which usually result in _ galaxy _ sizes notably larger than 2 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this number density is a lower limit because it has not come from a volume - limited sample . </S>",
    "<S> the actual density may be closer to @xmath7 , although further work is required to confirm this . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that not all massive ` spheroids ' have undergone dramatic structural and size evolution since @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> given that the bulges of local early - type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars which existed at @xmath9 , it seems likely that some of the observed high redshift spheroids did not increase in size by building ( 3d ) triaxial envelopes as commonly advocated , and that the growth of ( 2d ) disks has also been important over the past 911 billion years . </S>"
