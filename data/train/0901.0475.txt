    "it is well known that there are two basic spectral states , a high / soft state and a low / hard state in accreting x - ray binaries . at the high / soft state ,",
    "the accretion is dominantly via a standard disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) ; while at the low / hard state , the accretion is dominantly via an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) or a radiative inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; for reviews see narayan 2005 and kato et al .",
    "similar accretion models are proposed in active galactic nuclei ( narayan & yi 1994 , yuan et al .",
    "detailed fits to the observational spectra show that in the soft / high state of black hole the thin disk extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ; while in the hard / low states , the accretion flow consists of two radial zones , i.e. , an inner advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) that extends from isco ( or even inside the isco , see watarai & mineshige 2003 ) to some truncation radius and an outer thin accretion disk , above which is the corona which provides hot mass accretion flow for the inner adaf ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the mechanisms to facilitate the state transition have been investigated by honma ( 1996 ) , manmoto & kato ( 2000 ) and lu et al .",

    "the transition luminosity is defined as the critical accretion rate for an adaf to exist ( narayan & yi 1995b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) and thus is derived from the assumption that all of the accretion energy is transferred to electrons and eventually radiates away ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the disk - corona evaporation model ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer , liu , meyer - hofmeister 2000a ; b ; liu et al .",
    "2002 ) can naturally explain both the transition of spectral state and truncation of the thin disk in the low / hard state .",
    "the interaction between the disk and the corona leads to mass evaporating from the disk to the corona .",
    "the evaporation rate reaches a maximum value at a few hundred schwarzschild radii .",
    "when the accretion rate feeding the accretion in the outer disk is higher than the maximal evaporation rate , the disk extends down to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "when the accretion rate is lower than the maximal evaporation rate , the disk is first truncated at the most efficient evaporation region and then the inner disk could be completely depleted if the accretion rate is too low .",
    "the final steady state at high accretion rate is then the soft state dominated by disk accretion and at low accretion rate the hard state dominated by the adaf / riaf .",
    "the maximal evaporation rate corresponds to the transition accretion rate .",
    "investigation of the soft - to - hard state transition for x - ray binaries with good measurements of flux , distance and mass of the compact object shows that the transition luminosity is at about 1 - 4% of the eddington luminosity , with a mean of 2% ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of 2% by the disk corona evaporation model ( meyer et al 2000a ) .",
    "nevertheless , the transition luminosity of some sources deviates this value largely .",
    "for instance , the transition luminosity observed for gx 339 - 4 reaches 0.15 @xmath5 , while it is only 0.0069 @xmath6 for gs 2000 + 251 .",
    "studies of individual object , gx 339 - 4 , show that even for the same object the transition occurred at different luminosity during different outbursts ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2004 , belloni et al . 2006 ) . even in the same outburst ,",
    "the transition luminosity can differ in the rise and decay phases ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1995 ) . if it is the disk evaporation that causes the state transition in above cases , there should be something changed in the corona .",
    "one of the potential factors leading to different transition luminosity is the change of viscosity parameter , which is fixed to 0.3 in previous studies ( meyer et al .",
    "2000a;b ) .",
    "although the effective temperature profile and thus spectra do not depend on the @xmath0 value at all in the standard disk , the emissivity in an optically thin corona depends on the density and the density is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the radiative luminosity from an optically thin corona / adaf depends on the value of viscosity parameter . on the other hand",
    ", there is a long research history of the @xmath0 value through the study of outbursts of dwarf novae and x - ray novae ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1983 ; smak 1984 ; lin et al .",
    "1985 ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) .",
    "the most recent study for black holes ( king , pringle & livio 2007 ) yields @xmath7 ( if the viscosity is defined as @xmath8 ) .    for the range of @xmath9 ,",
    "the influence of viscosity has been studied by meyer - hofmeister & meyer ( 2001 ) for a few number of @xmath0 value . in their calculations , the temperature of electrons is assumed equal to that of ions , that is a one - temperature model . in reality , the accretion flows around a black hole can reach a temperature of @xmath10k or higher , at this situation electrons and ions decouple .",
    "therefore , we take the two - temperature disk corona model ( liu et al .",
    "2002 ) and carry out more detailed calculations for a series of viscosity parameters in the range of @xmath1 , which covers the recent observational estimates of the viscosity range ( king et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this work ,",
    "fitting formulae of the numerical results for both the maximal mass accretion rate and the corresponding radius depending on the viscosity parameter @xmath0 are given .",
    "on the basis of this , we compare our theoretical results with observations for individual x - ray binary and agns . in sect.2",
    "we briefly describe the physics of the corona above the thin disk and list equations .",
    "in sect.3 we show our numerical results and in sect.4 we compare the model predictions with observations . our discussions and conclusion are given in sect.5 and sect.6 .",
    "the disk corona model for accreting black holes is established in detail by meyer et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and later this model is extended close to the central black hole by taking into account the decoupling of ions and electrons ( liu et al .",
    "it is further developed by including the inflow and outflow of mass , energy and angular momentum from and towards neighboring zones ( meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2003 ) .",
    "the basic physics of the model is briefly described below .",
    "we consider a hot corona above a geometrically thin standard disk around a central black hole . in the corona",
    ", viscous dissipation leads to ion heating , which is partially transferred to the electrons by means of coulomb collisions .",
    "this energy is then conducted down into lower , cooler and denser corona .",
    "if the density in this layer is sufficiently high , the conductive flux is radiated away .",
    "if the density is too low to efficiently radiate the energy , cool matter is heated up and evaporation into the corona takes place .",
    "the mass evaporation goes on until an equilibrium density is established .",
    "the gas evaporating into the corona still retains angular momentum and will differentially rotate around the central object . by friction the gas looses angular momentum and",
    "drifts inward thus continuously drains mass from the corona towards the central object .",
    "this is compensated by a steady mass evaporation flow from the underlying disk .",
    "the process is driven by the gravitational potential energy released by friction in the form of heat in the corona . therefore , mass is accreted to the central object partially through the corona ( evaporated part ) and partially through the disk ( the left part of the supplying mass ) . in the inner region",
    "the evaporation becomes so efficient that all the matter accreting through the disk is heated up and accreted towards the black hole via the corona .",
    "only when the accretion rate is higher than the evaporation rate , can the disk survive . therefore , the disk is truncated at the radius where the evaporation rate equals to the accretion rate . in the case of accretion rate higher than the maximal evaporation rate ,",
    "the disk extends down to the isco . in this work ,",
    "we investigate how the maximal evaporation rate and the corresponding radius varies with viscosity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we use the model of liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and include the modification on the energy equation . for clarity , we list the equations describing the physics of corona as follows :    equation of state @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the molecular weight assuming a standard chemical composition ( @xmath13 ) for the corona . for convenience",

    "previous investigations ( liu , meyer , & meyer - hofmeister 1995 ) show that the coronal temperature increases from effective temperature to @xmath42k in a very thin layer and thus the lower boundary conditions can be reasonably approximated ( meyer et al .",
    "2000a ) as , @xmath43 at infinity , there is no pressure and no heat flux .",
    "this requires sound transition at some height @xmath44 .",
    "we then constrain the upper boundary as , @xmath45 with such boundary conditions , we assume a set of lower boundary values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 to start the integration along @xmath17 .",
    "only when the trial values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 fulfill the upper boundary conditions , can the presumed @xmath46 and @xmath47 be taken as true solutions of the differential equations .    here",
    "we wish to point out that the viscosity parameter @xmath0 we are studying in this work only appears in the viscous heating rate , @xmath48 , and radial drift speed , @xmath49 , which is eventually associated with the heating and cooling rates .",
    "in our calculation we fix the mass of black hole as @xmath50 and vary the viscous parameter @xmath0 in the range of 0.1 - 0.9 . for every given @xmath0 ,",
    "the evaporation rate is calculated as @xmath51 at the lower boundary and then is integrated in the radial one - zone region , @xmath52 .",
    "this integrated value represents the evaporation rate in a given region around distance @xmath53 and thus can be compared with the accretion rate .",
    "fig.1 shows how the evaporation rate varies with the distance from the black hole . here",
    "the evaporation rate is scaled by the eddington rate , @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the energy conversion efficiency ) and the radius is scaled by the schwarzschild radius , @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen that for every given @xmath0 the evaporation rate reaches a maximum at a certain distance and decreases very quickly outside the maximal evaporation region .",
    "the occurrence of maximal evaporation rate is a result of energy balance in the disk corona system . in the outer region , the evaporation rate increases toward central black hole since the released accretion energy increases ( @xmath57 ) , which is the source of energy for evaporation .",
    "however , with increase of number density in the corona , the radiation becomes more and more efficient ( since the bremsstrahlung is proportional to the square of number density ) and only a very little ( or even no ) gas is heated up and evaporates .",
    "thus , the evaporation rate reaches a maximum value and decreases again in the inner region .",
    "fig.1 also shows that the value of evaporation rates increases with the value of viscosity parameter , which is significant in the inner region but not obvious in the outer region .",
    "the increase of evaporation rate with viscosity is understood as a result of efficient heating and unimportant advection . in the inner region , the advective cooling ( related to @xmath0 )",
    "is not the dominant cooling process , as shown by our numerical data . for larger value of @xmath0",
    ", the viscous heating is more efficient , which leads to more energy that is conducted down to the chromosphere above the disk .",
    "there the conducted energy is partially radiated away and partially used to evaporate the cool gas .",
    "thus , the evaporation rate enhances for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is not significant in regions far away from the black hole since most of the viscous heating is transferred to the internal energy of corona gas , only a very small part is conducted down and relevant to evaporation .",
    "the maximal evaporation rate is very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the maximal evaporation rate for @xmath0=0.1 and @xmath0=0.9 are 0.001 and 0.2 eddington rate , respectively , increasing by a factor of about 200 from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the location of the maximal evaporation rates for @xmath0=0.1 and @xmath0=0.9 are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , decreasing by a factor of about 75 from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",

    "is 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.9 respectively .",
    "it shows that the evaporation rate increases with increasing @xmath0 . for larger",

( 2 ) the luminosity band in gierli@xmath62ski & newton ( 2006 ) is 1.5 - 12 kev .",
    "( 3 ) asterisk denotes the transition luminosity from high / soft state to low / hard state , for which the fitting value of @xmath0 should be slightly higher if the compton cooling by disk photons is included in our model .",
    "( 4 ) different transition luminosities for xte j 1550 - 564 and gx 339 - 4 are from different outbursts .",
    "the disk - corona evaporation model provides a physical mechanism for the spectral state transition between low / hard state and high / soft state and for truncation of the thin disk in the low state .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that there are still uncertainties in quantitative fits to observations .",
    "the value of the mass evaporation rate in our model is affected by several factors , such as the magnetic field ( qian et al .",
    "2007 ) , the thermal conduction ( meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2006 ) , and the inverse compton scattering ( liu et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it also depends sensitively on the viscosity parameter @xmath0 , as shown from our calculations .",
    "therefore , one should take into account all these factors in quantitative fits to observations .",
    "compton upscattering of photons from the disk can be important in cooling of the corona ( liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at high accretion rates ,",
    "the thin disk extends down to the isco , compton cooling becomes efficient and hence less heat is conducted downwards , which leads to a decreased evaporation rate .",
    "the maximal evaporation rate also decreases , indicating that the transition luminosity from soft to hard decreases as a result of compton cooling . on the other hand , at low accretion rate the disk is truncated .",
    "compton upscattering of disk radiation is not efficient , thereby hardly affects the evaporation rate .",
    "therefore , our model in this work is valid for the transition from low / hard state to high / state . for the transition from high / soft to low / hard state , the transition luminosity is a few times lower than that from low / hard to high / soft transition ( meyer - hofmeister et al . 2005 ; liu et al . 2005 ) , producing the observed hysteresis .",
    "it is interesting to note that different alpha values may also contribute to the hysteresis .",
    "this makes our prediction on hysteresis closer to the observations for objects showing very large hysteresis ( e.g. miyamoto et al 1995 ) .    in the case of a weak inner disk existing at low / hard states ( liu et al .",
    "2007 ) , the compton effect can also lead to a lower evaporation rate , but it can not change the maximal evaporation rate significantly .      as it has been shown in previous study",
    "( qian et al . 2007 ) , the magnetic fields and conduction hardly affect the transition luminosity , but lead to a small truncation radius at the state transition . here",
    "it is shown that increase of viscosity results in not only a decreased transition radius but also an enhanced transition luminosity .",
    "combination of these effects can make our model more flexible in fits to the observationally inferred transition luminosity and and the truncation radius . here",
    "one should note the physical link between magnetic field strengths and viscosity parameter .",
    "in fact , the viscosity is mostly provided by magnetic stress , though we are not very clear the detailed dependence of @xmath0 on magnetic stress .",
    "collecting and analyzing observational results from dwarf novae , soft x - ray transients and agns , king et al.(2007 ) find the range of viscous parameter is @xmath63",
    ". fits to the observational transition luminosity by our model give similar range for the viscous parameter .",
    "however , the value of @xmath0 derived by many mhd simulations is less than 0.02 .",
    "for instance , stone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derive @xmath0 @xmath640.01 ; brandenburg et al.(1995 ) get 0.001 @xmath64 @xmath0 @xmath640.005 , hirose , krolik & stone ( 2006 ) obtain @xmath65 , hawley & krolik ( 2001 ) get @xmath66 .",
    "the analysis of detailed observational data ( king et al . 2007 ) indicates that most mhd simulations underestimate the value of @xmath0 .",
    "caution should be taken to the fact that the @xmath0 value obtained from the numerical simulations depends how to calculate them , ( e.g. , machida , hayashi & matsumoto 2000 , machida & matsumoto 2003 , machida , nakamura & matsumoto 2004 ) .",
    "this is because the magnetized accretion flow shows highly inhomogeneous structure and significant time fluctuations .",
    "thus , the derived alpha values depend how to make time and spatial averages of physical quantities . generally speaking",
    ", the ratio of magnetic energy to gas energy and thus the alpha value increases with increase of height ; the alpha values sometimes even exceed unity in corona ( see , e.g. , machida et al .",
    "2000 ) . hence , if we make the spatial average with weight of magnetic energy instead of gas density or gas energy , the derived alpha values tend to be higher .",
    "the fraction of mass carried away by the wind sensitively depends on the value of @xmath0 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the fraction increases from @xmath687% at the maximal evaporation region ( @xmath69 ) to @xmath689.8% at @xmath70 . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the fraction increases from @xmath681.4% at the maximal evaporation region ( @xmath71 ) to @xmath682.7% at @xmath70 . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the fraction increases from @xmath6816% at @xmath72 to 19% at @xmath70 .",
    "one can see the fraction of mass carried away by the wind increases systemically with an increase of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood as the higher temperature and pressure in the larger @xmath0 case .",
    "our model indicates that the accretion flow changes from a corona / adaf to a thin disk when the accretion rate exceeds the maximal evaporation rate .",
    "thus , the maximal evaporation rate represents the critical accretion rate for the accretion taking the form of a corona / adaf .",
    "our detailed calculations show that the maximal evaporation rate depends on the viscous parameter approximately in the form of @xmath73 .",
    "this result is similar to the critical accretion rate for an adaf to exist , that is , @xmath74 ( narayan & yi 1995b ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "the similar dependent laws on the viscosity are easy to understand since both the maximal evaporation rate and critical accretion rate for an adaf to exist are derived from the assumption that all of the viscous heating is transferred to electrons and eventually radiated away ( @xmath4 , for details see mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "now that the evaporation as a consequence of disk corona interaction can completely deplete the inner disk and turn it into a pure corona / adaf when the accretion rate is less than the maximal evaporation rate , the disk evaporation model provides a naturally physical mechanism for the `` strong adaf '' principle , that is , whenever the accretion rate is lower than the critical accretion rate , the accretion is via an adaf .",
    "using the two - temperature disk corona model , we investigate the influence of viscosity on the evaporation feature .",
    "we find that the evaporation rate depends strongly on the value of viscous parameter .",
    "for @xmath3 , the maximal evaporation rate varies by two orders of magnitude , from 0.001 to 0.2 eddington rate .",
    "the distance corresponding to the maximal evaporation rate also varies by near two orders of magnitude .",
    "an numerical fitting formulae of the maximal mass evaporation rate as a function of viscosity is given by fitting the numerical data .",
    "the corresponding radius is also given as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "since the maximal evaporation rate represents the critical accretion rate at the transition from low / hard to high / soft state , we compare our model with observations .",
    "we find that the transition luminosity can be fitted by adjusting the value of @xmath0 , and the model determined values of @xmath0 are mostly in the range of observationally inferred value ( king et al .",
    "meanwhile we investigate the truncation of the disk in the low / hard state for some luminous sources .",
    "our results are roughly in agreement with the observations .",

    "<S> a wealth of galactic accreting x - ray binaries have been observed both in low / hard state and high / soft state . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between these two states was often detected . </S>",
    "<S> observation shows that the transition luminosity between these two states is different for different sources , ranging from 1% to 4% of the eddington luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> even for the same source the transition luminosity at different outbursts is also different . </S>",
    "<S> the transition can occur from 0.0069 to 0.15 eddington luminosity . to investigate the underlying physics , we study the influence of viscosity parameter @xmath0 on the transition luminosity on the basis of the disk - corona model for black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the mass evaporation rate for a wide range of viscosity parameter , @xmath1 . by fitting the numerical results </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain fitting formulae for both the transition accretion rate and the corresponding radius as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transition luminosity is very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3 , the transition luminosity varies by two orders of magnitude , from 0.001 to 0.2 eddington luminosity . comparing with observations we find that the transition luminosity can be fitted by adjusting the value of @xmath0 , and the model determined values of @xmath0 are mostly in the range of observationally </S>",
    "<S> inferred value . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile we investigate the truncation of the disk in the low / hard state for some luminous sources . </S>",
    "<S> our results are roughly in agreement with the observations . </S>"
