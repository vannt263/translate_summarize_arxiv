    "supernovae observations suggest that our universe is accelerating and the dark energy contributes @xmath0 to the critical energy density of the present universe . in addition ,",
    "cosmic microwave background observations imply that the standard cosmology is given by the inflation and frw universe . on the one hand , a non - zero cosmological",
    "constant satisfies the existence of dark energy in the universe . on the other hand , our measurements",
    "are claimed to apply the existence of a dark energy in the background gravity with non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , a typical candidate for the dark energy is the cosmological constant . in quantum field theory",
    "it is shown that , a short distance cutoff ( uv cutoff : @xmath1 ) is related to a long distance cutoff ( ir cutoff : @xmath2 ) due to the limit set by forming a black hole .",
    "taking @xmath3 as the size of the present universe , the resulting energy is comparable to the present dark energy . even though when this approach leads to the data , the description is incomplete because it fails to explain the dark energy dominated present universe .",
    "to resolve this situation , one is forced to introduce another candidate for ir cutoff .",
    "one is the particle horizon @xmath4that used by fishler and susskind .",
    "this gives @xmath5 which implies @xmath6 however ; this result corresponds to a decelerating universe .",
    "a recent study of the x - ray emission of hot gas in a massive cluster of galaxy has allowed astronomers to determine the distribution of its dark matter content .",
    "the density of dark matter appears to increase towards the center of the cluster in agreement with cold - dark matter production .",
    "the x - ray data show that the dark matter density increases smoothly all the way into the central galaxy of the cluster . in the past five years",
    ", there has been growing evidence in favor of the cold - dark matter model .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe showed that normal baryon matter only accounts for 17 percent of the matter content of the universe ; the rest being cold dark matter of unknown nature .",
    "dark matter particles must have the property of increasing with each other and with normal baryon matter only through gravity .",
    "these so - called weakly interacting massive particles are difficult to detect and have been elusive until now .",
    "massive neutrinos are a possible dark matter candidate , usually referred to them as hot dark matter because they travel at close the speed of light . due to this high speed ,",
    "hot dark matter models of the early universe create big structure of the size of galaxy clusters , which then fragment to form galaxies .",
    "by contrast , the slower cold dark matter particles can not travel as far and so form small galaxies , which then merge to form the bigger structures such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "our problem is related to answer the question : hot dark matter drives an accelerating universe or cold dark matter .",
    "the friedman equation is solved for a universe contains hot - dark matter and could dark matter .",
    "it is shown that , hot - dark matter drives an accelerating universe no cold dark matter .",
    "now , we explain the effects of massive neutrinos ( as natural candidate for hot dark matter ) to accelerating universe . the constraint on the ir cutoff of a box with volume @xmath7 in an effective field theory is given by , @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the ir cutoff scale .",
    "let take @xmath2 as the size of our universe ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the resulted energy is comparable to the present dark energy . in this case",
    "the friedman equation including a matter of @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 which leads to an uncertainty with @xmath13 .",
    "however , accelerating universe requires that@xmath14 .",
    "so this case is excluded . for a universe containing cold dark",
    "matter one can take the case of the friedman equation @xmath15 leading to an integral equation @xmath16 and taking the form @xmath17 the energy density is @xmath18 .",
    "this case is still a decelerating phase because the moving hubble scale(@xmath19/a ) is increasing with time .",
    "an accelerating universe is satisfied by @xmath20 so , in an inflationary universe the changing rate of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath22 is always negative .",
    "let us solve the friedman equation in a universe containing hot - dark matter . in the early universe ,",
    "hot dark matter creates the big structure of universe .",
    "massive neutrinos ( as natural candidate for hot dark matter ) travel at close to the speed of light . according to relativity theory , in the viewpoint of an observer ( due to the light speed ) , the time expansions will occur .",
    "for this reason , we must take the integral bound of fishler - susskind integral from , @xmath23 to , @xmath24 using an integral form of friedman equation of @xmath25=c , we obtain , @xmath26 this leads to @xmath27 with @xmath28 that corresponds to an accelerating universe .",
    "dark particles must have the property of increasing with each other and with normal baryon matter only through gravity .",
    "so - called weakly gravity interacting massive dark particle are difficult to detect and have been elusive until now .",
    "massive neutrinos are a possible dark particle candidate , usually referred to them as hot dark matter because they travel at close to the speed of light , due to this light speed , hot dark matter models of the early universe create big structure of the size of galaxy clusters , which then fragment to form galaxies . by contrast , the slower cold dark matter particles can not travel as far and forms the small galaxies first , which then merge to form the bigger structures such as clusters of galaxy .",
    "we showed that , the hot dark matter ( neutrinos ) drives an accelerating universe ."
