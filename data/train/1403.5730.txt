    "next generation wireless communication networks are required to provide ubiquitous and high data rate communication with guaranteed quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "these requirements have led to a tremendous need for energy in both transmitter(s ) and receiver(s ) . in practice ,",
    "portable mobile devices are typically powered by capacity limited batteries which require frequent recharging . besides",
    ", battery technology has developed very slowly over the past decades and the battery capacities available in the near future will be unable to improve this situation .",
    "consequently , energy harvesting based mobile communication system design has become a prominent approach for addressing this issue . in particular , it enables self - sustainability for energy limited communication networks .",
    "in addition to conventional energy harvesting sources such as solar , wind , and biomass , wireless power transfer has been proposed as an emerging alternative energy source , where the receivers scavenge energy from the ambient radio frequency ( rf ) signals @xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact , wireless power transfer technology not only eliminates the need of power cords and chargers , but also facilitates one - to - many charging due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels .",
    "more importantly , it enables the possibility of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) leading to many interesting and challenging new research problems which have to be solved to bridge the gap between theory and practice . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated the fundamental trade - off between harvested energy and wireless channel capacity across a pair of coupled inductor circuit in the presence of additive white gaussian noise .",
    "then , in @xcite , the study was extended to multiple antenna wireless broadcast systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the energy efficiency of multi - carrier systems with swipt was revealed .",
    "specifically , it was shown in @xcite that integrating an energy harvester into a conventional information receiver improves the energy efficiency of a communication network . in @xcite ,",
    "robust beamforming design for swipt systems with physical layer security was investigated .",
    "the results in @xcite@xcite indicate that both the information rate and the amount of harvested energy at the receivers can be significantly increased at the expense of an increase in the transmit power .",
    "however , despite the promising results in the literature , the performance of wireless power / energy transfer systems is still limited by the distance between the transmitter and the receiver due to the high signal attenuation associated with path loss .",
    "coordinated multipoint ( comp ) transmission is an important technique for extending service coverage , improving spectral efficiency , and mitigating interference @xcite@xcite .",
    "a possible deployment scenario for comp networks is to split the functionalities of the base stations between a central processor ( cp ) and a set of remote radio heads ( rrhs ) . in particular",
    ", the cp performs the power hungry and computationally intensive baseband signal processing while the rrhs are responsible for all radio frequency ( rf ) operations such as analog filtering and power amplification . besides",
    ", the rrhs are distributed across the network and connected to the cp via backhaul links .",
    "this system architecture is known as cloud computing network . as a result",
    ", the comp systems architecture inherently provides spatial diversity for combating path loss and shadowing .",
    "it has been shown that a significant system performance gain can be achieved when full cooperation is enabled in comp systems @xcite . however , in practice , the enormous signalling overhead incurred by the information exchange between the cp and the rrhs may be infeasible when the capacity of the backhaul link is limited .",
    "hence , resource allocation for comp networks with finite backhaul capacity has attracted much attention in the research community @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the energy efficiency of comp multi - cell networks with capacity constrained backhaul links . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "iterative sparse beamforming algorithms were proposed to reduce the load of the backhaul links while providing reliable communication to the users .",
    "however , the energy sources of the receivers in @xcite@xcite were assumed to be perpetual and this assumption may not be valid for power - constrained portable devices . on the other hand , the signals transmitted by the rrhs could be exploited for energy harvesting by the power - constrained receivers for extending their lifetimes . however , the resource allocation algorithm design for comp swipt systems has not been solved sofar , and will be tackled in this paper . motivated by the aforementioned observations , we formulate the resource allocation algorithm design for multiuser comp communication networks with swipt as a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "we jointly minimize the total network transmit power and the maximum capacity consumption per backhaul link while ensuring quality of service ( qos ) for reliable communication and efficient wireless power transfer .",
    "in particular , we propose an iterative algorithm which provides a local optimal solution for the considered optimization problem .",

    "besides , the cp is not at the same location as the rrh for the co - located transmit antenna system , i.e. , a backhaul is still needed .",

    "we note that the gap between the proposed algorithm and the exhaustive search in figure [ fig : backhaul_nt_subfig1 ] is caused by the sub - optimality of the objective function approximation in ( [ eqn : objective_approx ] ) and insufficient numbers of iterations .",
    "in fact , the superior average maximum system backhaul capacity consumption of the optimal exhaustive scheme in figure [ fig : backhaul_nt_subfig1 ] compared to the proposed scheme comes at the expense of an exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of irs and rrhs . on the other hand ,",
    "the performance gap between the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm and the full cooperation scheme(/co - located antennas system ) increases as the total number of transmit antennas . in figures [ fig : backhaul_nt_subfig1 ] and [ fig : backhaul_nt_subfig2 ] , we observe that the average backhaul capacity consumption of the proposed algorithm decreases monotonically with an increasing number of antennas and converges to constant values close to the lower bounds , respectively .",

    "[ fig : pt_nt ] , we study the average total transmit power versus total number of transmit antennas for different resource allocation schemes . it can be observed that the total transmit power decreases monotonically with increasing number of transmit antennas .",

    "besides , the proposed algorithm consumes a lower transmit power compared to the optimal exhaustive search scheme .",
    "this is because the exhaustive search scheme consumes a smaller backhaul capacity at the expense of a higher transmit power .",
    "furthermore , the system with co - located antennas consumes a higher transmit power than the proposed scheme and the full cooperation scheme in all considered scenarios which reveals the power saving potential of comp due to its inherent spatial diversity . on the other hand",

    "as can be observed , the total average harvested powers in all considered scenarios are monotonically non - increasing with respect to the number of transmit antennas .",
    "this is because the extra degrees of freedom offered by the increasing number of antennas improve the efficiency of resource allocation . in particular ,",
    "the direction of beamforming matrix @xmath101 can be more accurately steered towards the irs which reduces the power allocation to @xmath101 and the leakage of power to the ers .",
    "this also explains the lower harvested power for the full cooperation scheme and the system with co - located antennas since they both exploit all transmit antennas in the network for joint transmission . on the other hand ,",
    "the highest amount of radiated power can be harvested for the exhaustive search scheme at the expense of a higher total transmit power .",
    "in this paper , we studied the resource allocation algorithm design for comp multiuser communication systems with swipt .",

    "it can be verified that ( [ eqn : sdp_relaxation ] ) satisfies slater s constraint qualification and is jointly convex with respect to the optimization variables .",
    "thus , strong duality holds and solving the dual problem is equivalent to solving the primal problem @xcite . for the dual problem ,",

    "we substitute @xmath169 into ( [ eqn : dual2 ] ) which leads to @xmath171 on the other hand , since the channel vectors of @xmath172 and @xmath173 are assumed to be statistically independent , it follows that by setting @xmath174 , the term @xmath175 and the dual optimal value becomes unbounded from below . besides , the optimal value of the primal problem is non - negative for @xmath69",
    "thus , strong duality does not hold which leads to a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath165 is a positive definite matrix with probability one , i.e. , @xmath176 .    by exploiting ( [ eqn : lagrangian_gradient ] ) and a basic inequality for the rank of matrices , we have @xmath177 thus , @xmath178 is either @xmath179 or @xmath180 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath181 is required to satisfy the minimum sinr requirement of ir @xmath35 in c1 for @xmath69 .",
    "hence , @xmath163 and @xmath182 hold with probability one .",
    "in other words , the optimal joint beamformer @xmath106 can be obtained by performing eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath161 and selecting the principal eigenvector as the beamformer .",

    "<S> remote radio heads ( rrhs ) are connected to a central processor ( cp ) via capacity - limited backhaul links to facilitate comp joint transmission . besides , the cp transfers energy to the rrhs for more efficient network operation . </S>",
    "<S> the considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non - convex optimization problem with a minimum required signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraint at multiple information receivers and a minimum required power transfer constraint at the energy harvesting receivers . by optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the cp and energy sharing between the cp and the rrhs </S>",
    "<S> , we aim at jointly minimizing the total network transmit power and the maximum capacity consumption per backhaul link . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting non - convex optimization problem is np - hard . in light of the intractability of the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we reformulate it by replacing the non - convex objective function with its convex hull , which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm . in each iteration </S>",
    "<S> , a non - convex optimization problem is solved by semi - definite programming ( sdp ) relaxation and the proposed iterative algorithm converges to a local optimal solution of the original problem . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a close - to - optimal performance and provides a significant reduction in backhaul capacity consumption compared to full cooperation . besides </S>",
    "<S> , the considered comp network is shown to provide superior system performance as far as power consumption is concerned compared to a traditional system with multiple antennas co - located . </S>"
