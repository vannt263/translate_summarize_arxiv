    "the most important event in neutrino physics of the last decades was the solving of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the sun appeared in this case as a natural laboratory for investigations of neutrino properties .",
    "there exists a number of natural laboratories , the supernova explosions , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics .",
    "it means that microscopic neutrino characteristics , such as the neutrino magnetic moment , etc . , would have a critical impact on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .",
    "one of the processes caused by the photon interaction with the neutrino magnetic moment , which could play an important role in astrophysics , is the radiative neutrino spin flip transition @xmath2 .",
    "the process can be kinematically allowed in medium due to its influence on the photon dispersion , @xmath3 ( here @xmath4 is the refractive index ) , when the medium provides the condition @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the effective photon mass squared is negative , @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known effect of the neutrino cherenkov radiation  @xcite .",
    "there exists also such a well - known subtle effect as the additional energy @xmath7 acquired by a left - handed neutrino in plasma .",
    "this additional energy was considered in the series of papers by studenikin et al .",
    "@xcite as a new kinematical possibility to allow the radiative neutrino transition @xmath2 .",
    "the effect was called the `` spin light of neutrino '' .",
    "for some reason , the photon dispersion in medium providing in part the photon effective mass , was ignored in these papers .",
    "however , it is evident that a kinematical analysis based on the additional neutrino energy in plasma ( caused by the weak forces ) when the plasma influence on the photon dispersion ( caused by electromagnetic forces ) is ignored , can not be considered as a physical approach . in this paper",
    ", we perform a consistent analysis of the radiative neutrino spin flip transition in medium , when its influence both on the photon and neutrino dispersion is taken into account .",
    "let us start from the cherenkov process of the photon creation by neutrino , @xmath2 , which should be appended by the crossed process of the photon absorption @xmath8 . at this stage",
    "we neglect the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath7 , which will be inserted below . for the @xmath9 conversion width one",
    "obtains by the standard way : @xmath10 % & \\times & \\left\\ { \\frac{\\delta ( e - e ' - \\omega)}{2 \\ , \\omega }   \\left [ 1 + f_\\gamma ( \\omega ) \\right ] + \\frac{\\delta ( e - e ' + \\omega)}{2 \\ , \\omega } \\ ,   f_\\gamma ( \\omega )   \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : gamma1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the neutrino magnetic moment current , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the four - momenta of the initial and final neutrinos and photon , respectively , @xmath16 mean transversal and longitudinal photon polarizations , @xmath17 is the bose  einstein photon distribution function , and @xmath18 is the photon wave - function renormalization . the functions @xmath19 , defining the photon dispersion law : @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of the photon polarization tensor : @xmath21",
    ".    the width @xmath22 can be rewritten to another form .",
    "let us introduce the energy transferred from neutrino : @xmath23 , which is expressed via the photon energy @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26-functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) can be rewritten : @xmath27 transforming the @xmath26-function to have the dispersion law in the argument : @xmath28^{-1 } \\ ,   \\delta \\left(q^2 - \\pi_{(\\lambda ) } ( q ) \\right ) , \\label{eq : delta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that the renormalization factor @xmath29 is cancelled in the conversion width  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) with the @xmath26-function  ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) can be easily performed when the function @xmath30 is real .",
    "however , it has , in general , an imaginary part .",
    "it means , that the photon is unstable in plasma .",
    "in the case , when the eigenfunction @xmath30 has an imaginary part , one should use instead of the @xmath26-function its natural generalization of the breit  wigner type , with e.g. the retarded functions @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "after some transformations , taking into account the additional energy @xmath7 acquired by a left - handed neutrino in plasma , and changing the integration variables from the final neutrino 3-momentum to the photon energy and momentum , @xmath36 , one obtains :    @xmath37 \\ , ( 2 e - q_0)^2 \\ , q^4 \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] % & & \\times   \\left\\ {   \\left ( 1 - \\frac{k^2}{(2 e - q_0)^2 } \\right )   \\left [ 1 - \\frac{2 q_0 w}{q^2 } + \\frac{8 e ( e - q_0 ) w^2 } { q^4 \\left [ ( 2 e - q_0)^2/k^2 - 1   \\right ] } \\right ]   \\varrho_{(t ) } ( q_0 , k ) \\right .",

    "we only need to identify the photon spectral density functions @xmath40 .",
    "to show manifestly that the case considered in the papers by studenikin et al .",
    "@xcite , with taking the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath7 in plasma and ignoring the photon dispersion , was really unphysical , let us consider the region of integration for the width @xmath22 in eq .",

    ", scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for the fixed plasma parameters , the threshold neutrino energy @xmath43 exists for coming of the dispersion curve into the allowed kinematical region . even for the interior of a neutron star this threshold",
    "neutrino energy is rather large : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the plasmon frequency .",
    "one could hope that the `` spin light of neutrino '' may be possible at ultra - high neutrino energies .",
    "however , in this case the local limit of the weak interaction is incomplete , and the non - local weak contribution into additional neutrino energy @xmath7 must be taken into account .",
    "this contribution always has a negative sign , and its absolute value grows with the neutrino energy .",
    "one could only hope that the window arises in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath46 .",
    "for example , in the solar interior there is no window for the process with electron neutrinos at all .",
