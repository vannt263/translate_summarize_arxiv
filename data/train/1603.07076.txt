    "depth sensors are becoming ubiquitous in applications ranging from security to robotics and from entertainment to smart spaces @xcite . while recent advances in pose estimation have improved performance on front and side views , most real - world settings present challenging viewpoints such as top or angled views in retail stores , hospital environments , or airport settings .",
    "these viewpoints introduce high levels of self - occlusion making human pose estimation difficult for existing algorithms .",
    "humans are remarkably robust at predicting full rigid - body and articulated poses in these challenging scenarios . however , most work in the human pose estimation literature has addressed relatively constrained settings .",
    "there has been a long line of work on generative pose models , where a pose is estimated by constructing a skeleton using templates or priors in a top - down manner @xcite .",
    "in contrast , discriminative methods directly identify individual body parts , labels , or positions and construct the skeleton in a bottom - up approach @xcite .",
    "however , recent research in both classes primarily focus on frontal views with few occlusions despite the abundance of occlusion and partial - pose research in object detection @xcite .",
    "even modern representation learning techniques address human pose estimation from frontal or side views @xcite .",
    "while the above methods improve human pose estimation , they fail to address viewpoint variances .    in this work",
    "we address the problem of viewpoint invariant pose estimation from single depth images .",
    "there are two challenges towards this goal .",
    "the first challenge is designing a model that is not only rich enough to reason about 3d spatial information but also robust to viewpoint changes .",
    "the model must understand both local and global human pose structure .",
    "that is , it must fuse techniques from local part - based discriminative models and global skeleton - driven generative models . additionally , it must be able to reason about 3d volumes , geometric , and viewpoint transformations .",
    "the second challenge is that existing real - world depth datasets are often small in size , both in terms of number of frames and number of classes @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the use of representation learning methods and viewpoint transfer techniques has been limited .    to address these challenges , our contributions are as follows : first ,",
    "on the technical side , we embed local pose information into a learned , viewpoint invariant feature space .",
    "furthermore , we extend the iterative error feedback model @xcite to model higher - order temporal dependencies ( figure [ fig : pull ] ) . to handle occlusions",
    ", we formulate our model with a multi - task learning objective .",
    "second , we introduce a new dataset of 100k depth images with pixel - wise body part labels and 3d human joint locations .",
    "the dataset consists of extreme cases of viewpoint variance with front , top , and side views of people performing 15 actions with occluded body parts .",
    "we evaluate our model on an existing public dataset @xcite and our newly collected dataset demonstrating state - of - the - art performance on viewpoint invariant pose estimation .",
    "* rgb - based human pose estimation*. several methods have been proposed for human pose estimation , including edge - based histograms of the human - body @xcite and silhouette contours @xcite .",
    "more general techniques using pictorial structures @xcite and deformable part models @xcite , continued to build appearance models for each local body part independently .",
    "subsequently , higher - level part - based models were developed to capture more complex body part relationships and obtain more discriminative templates @xcite .",
    "these models continued to evolve , attempting to capture even higher - level part features .",
    "convolutional networks @xcite , a class of representation learning methods @xcite , began to exhibit performance gains not only in human pose estimation , but various areas of computer vision @xcite .",
    "since valid human poses represent a much lower - dimensional manifold in the high - dimensional input space , it is difficult to directly regress from input image to output poses with a convolutional network . as a solution to this , researchers framed the problem as a multi - task learning problem where human joints must be first detected then precisely localized @xcite .",

    "@xcite combines a convolutional network part - detector with a part - based spatial model into a unified framework .    because human pose estimation is ultimately a structured prediction task , it is difficult for convolutional networks to correctly regress the full pose in a single pass",

    "sun et al . proposed a multi - stage system of convolutional networks for predicting facial point locations .",

    "* overview . *",
    "the goal of our model is to achieve viewpoint invariant pose estimation .",
    "the iterative error feedback mechanism proposed by @xcite demonstrates promising results on front and side view rgb images .",
    "however , a fundamental challenge remains unsolved : how can a model learn to be viewpoint invariant ?",
    "our core contribution is as follows : we leverage depth data to embed local patches into a learned viewpoint invariant feature space . as a result",
    ", we can train a body part detector to be invariant to viewpoint changes . to provide richer context",
    ", we also introduce recurrent connections to enable our model to reason on past actions and guide downstream global pose estimation ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .      * local input representation .",
    "* one of our goals is to use local body part context to guide downstream global pose prediction . to achieve this",
    ", we propose a two - step process .",
    "first , we extract a set of patches from the input depth image where each patch is centered around each predicted body part . by feeding these patches into our model",
    ", it can reason on low - level , local part information .",
    "we transform these patches into patches called _ glimpses _ @xcite .",
    "a glimpse is a retina - like encoding of the original input that encodes pixels further from the center with a progressively lower resolution . as a result ,",
    "the model must focus on specific input regions with high resolution while maintaining some , but not all spatial information .",
    "these glimpses are stacked and denoted by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of joints , @xmath9 is the glimpse height , and @xmath10 is the glimpse and width .",
    "glimpses for iteration @xmath4 are generated using the predicted pose @xmath1 from the previous iteration @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 , we use the average pose @xmath13 .",
    "is converted into a voxel @xmath14 . a localization network @xmath15 regresses 3d transformation parameters @xmath16 which are applied to @xmath14 with a trilinear sampler .",
    "the resulting feature map @xmath17 is projected onto 2d which gives the embedding @xmath18 . ]    * learned viewpoint invariant embedding .",
    "* we embed the input into a learned , viewpoint invariant feature space ( see figure [ fig : stn ] ) .",
    "since each glimpse @xmath19 is a real world depth map , we can convert each glimpse into a voxel @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the depth of the voxel .",
    "we refer to _ voxel _ as a volumetric representation of the depth map and not a full 3d model .",
    "this representation allows us to transform the glimpse in 3d thereby simulating occlusions and geometric variations which may be present from other viewpoints .",
    "given the voxel @xmath14 , we now transform it into a viewpoint invariant feature map @xmath22 .",
    "we follow @xcite in a two - step process : first , we use a _ localization network _ @xmath23 to estimate a set of 3d transformation parameters @xmath16 which will be applied to the voxel @xmath14 .",
    "second , we compute a _ sampling grid _ defined as @xmath24 .",
    "each coordinate of the sampling grid , i.e. @xmath25 , defines where we must apply a sampling kernel in voxel @xmath14 to compute @xmath26 of the output feature map .",
    "however , since @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real - valued , we convolve @xmath14 with a sampling kernel , @xmath29 , and define the output feature map @xmath17 : @xmath30 where the kernel @xmath31 is the trilinear sampling kernel . as a final step",
    ", we project the viewpoint invariant 3d feature map @xmath17 into a viewpoint invariant 2d feature map @xmath18 : @xmath32 notice that equations ( [ eq : stn ] ) and ( [ eq : stn2 ] ) are linear functions applied to the voxel @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", upstream gradients can flow smoothly through these mathematical units .",
    "the resulting @xmath18 now represents two - dimensional viewpoint invariant representation of the input glimpse . at this point",
    ", @xmath18 is used as input into a convolutional network for human body part detection and error feedback prediction .    * convolutional and recurrent networks . * as previously mentioned , our goal is to use local input patches to guide downstream global pose predictions .",
    "we stack the viewpoint invariant feature maps @xmath18 for each joint to form a @xmath33 tensor .",
    "this tensor is fed to a convolutional network . through the hierarchical receptive fields of the convolutional network ,",
    "the network s output is a global representation of the human pose . directly regressing body part positions from the dense activation layers . ]",
    "has proven to be difficult due to the highly non - linear mapping present in traditional human pose estimation @xcite .",
    "inspired by @xcite s work in the rgb domain , we adopt an iterative refinement technique which uses multiple steps to fine - tune the pose by correcting previous pose estimates . in @xcite ,",
    "each refinement step is only indirectly influenced by previous iterations through the accumulation of error feedback .",
    "we claim that these refinement iterations should have a more direct and shared temporal representation . to remedy this ,",
    "we introduce recurrent connections between each iteration ; specifically a long short term memory ( lstm ) module @xcite .",
    "this enables our model to directly access the underlying hidden network state which generated prior feedback and model higher - order temporal dependencies .",
    "our primary goal is to achieve viewpoint invariance . in extreme cases such as top views ,",
    "many human joints are occluded . to be robust to such occlusions ,",
    "we want our model to reason on the visibility of joints .",
    "we formulate the optimization procedure as a multi - task problem consisting of two objectives : ( i ) a body - part detection task , where the goal is to determine whether a body part is visible or occluded in the input and ( ii ) a pose regression task , where we predict the offsets to the correct real world 3d position of visible human body joints .    * body - part detection*. for body part detection , the goal is to determine whether a particular body part is visible or occluded in the input .",
    "this is denoted by the predicted visibility mask @xmath34 which is a @xmath35 binary vector , where @xmath8 is the total number of body joints .",
    "the ground truth visibility mask is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "if a body part is predicted to be visible , then @xmath37 , otherwise @xmath38 denotes occlusion .",
    "the visibility mask @xmath34 is computed using a softmax over the unnormalized log probabilities @xmath39 generated by the lstm .",
    "hence , our objective is to minimize the cross - entropy .",
    "the visibility loss for a single example is : @xmath40 regardless of the ground truth and the predicted visibility mask , the above formulation forces our model to improve its part detection .",
    "additionally , it allows for occluded body part recovery if the ground truth visibility is fixed to @xmath41 .    * partial error feedback . * ultimately , our goal is to predict the location of the joint corresponding to each visible human body part . to achieve this",
    ", we refine our previous pose prediction by learning correction offsets ( i.e. feedback ) denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we only learn correction offsets for joints that are visible . at each time step",
    ", a regression predicts offsets @xmath43 which are used to update the current pose estimate @xmath44 .",
    "specifically : @xmath45 denote real - world @xmath46 positions of each joint .",
    "@xmath47 the loss shown in ( [ eq : error_loss ] ) is motivated by our goal of predicting partial poses .",
    "consider the case of when the right knee is not visible in the input .",
    "if our model successfully labels the right knee as occluded , we wish to prevent the error feedback loss from backpropagating through our network .",
    "to achieve this , we include the indicator term @xmath48 which only backpropagates pose error feedback if a particular joint is visible in the original image .",
    "a secondary benefit is that we do not force the regressor to output dummy real values ( if a joint is occluded ) which may skew the model s understanding of output magnitude .    *",
    "global loss . *",
    "the resulting objective is the linear combination of the error feedback cost function for all joints and the detection cost function for all body parts : @xmath49 .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 define the relative weight of each sub - objective .",
    "we train the full model end - to - end in a single step of optimization .",
    "we train the convolutional and recurrent network from scratch with all weights initialized from a gaussian with @xmath52 .",
    "gradients are computed using @xmath53 and flow through the recurrent and convolutional networks .",
    "we use the adam @xcite optimizer with an initial learning rate of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "an exponential learning rate decay schedule is applied with a decay rate of 0.99 every 1,000 iterations .",
    "we evaluate our model on a publicly available dataset that has been used by recent state - of - the - art human pose methods .",
    "to more rigorously evaluate our model , we also collected a new dataset consisting of varied camera viewpoints .",
    "see figure [ fig : datasets ] for samples .",
    "* previous depth datasets .",
    "* we use the stanford eval dataset @xcite which consists of 9k front - facing depth images .",

    "similar to leave - one - out cross validation , we adopt a leave - one - out train - test procedure . one person is selected as the test set and the other two people are designated as the training set .",

    "the frontal view contains @xmath57 views of each person , although not necessarily uniformly distributed .",
    "the top view contains images captured solely from the top ( i.e. camera on the ceiling pointed down to the floor )",
    ".    * data collection .",
    "* two asus xtion pro cameras were used .",
    "one camera was placed on the ceiling facing down while another camera was from a traditional front - facing viewpoint . to annotate each frame , we used a series of steps that progressively involved more human supervision if necessary .",
    "first , 3d joints were estimated using @xcite from the front - facing camera .",
    "these coordinates were then transformed into the respective world coordinate system of each camera in the system .",
    "second , we used an iterative ground truth error correction technique based on per - pixel labeling using k - nearest neighbors and center of mass convergence .",
    "finally , humans manually validated , corrected , and discarded noisy frames . on average ,",
    "the human labeling procedure took one second per frame .",
    "we evaluate our model using two metrics . as introduced in @xcite",
    ", we use the percentage of correct keypoints ( pckh ) with a variable threshold .",
    "this metric defines a successful human joint localization if the predicted joint is within 50% of the head segment length to the ground truth joint .    for summary tables and figures , we use the mean average precision ( map ) which is the average precision for all human body parts .",
    "precision is reported for individual body parts .",
    "a successful detection occurs when the predicted joint is less than 10 cm from the ground truth in 3d space .",
    "our model is implemented in tensorflow @xcite .",
    "we use mini - batches of size 10 and 10 refinement steps per batch .",
    "we use the vgg-16 @xcite architecture for our convolutional network but instead modify the first layer to accommodate the increased number of input channels .",
    "additionally , we reduce the number of neurons in the dense layers to 2048 . we remove the final softmax layer and use the second dense layer activations as input into a recurrent network . for the recurrent network ,",
    "we use a long short term memory ( lstm ) module @xcite consisting of 2048 hidden units .",

    "* we analyze the effect of recurrent connections compared to regular iterative error feedback and direct prediction .",
    "to evaluate iterative feedback , we use our final model but remove the lstm module and regress the visibility mask @xmath34 and error feedback @xmath43 using the dense layer activations . note that we still use a multi - task loss and glimpse inputs .",
    "direct prediction does not involve feedback but instead attempts to directly regress correct pose locations in a single pass .",

    "iterative - based approaches significantly improve performance by 30 points .",
    "it is clear that recurrent connections improve performance , especially in the top - view case where recurrent feedback achieves 91.4 upper body map while iterative feedback achieves 51.7 upper body map .",
    "figure [ fig : iterations ] shows how our model updates the pose over time .",
    "consistent across all images , the first iteration always involves a large , seemingly random transformation of the pose .",
    "this can be thought of as the model is  looking around \" the initial pose estimate .",
    "once the model understands the initial surrounding area , it returns to the human body and begins to fine - tune the pose prediction , as shown in iteration 10 .",
    "figure [ fig : glimpse_vs_heatmap]b quantitatively illustrates this result .    * effect of glimpses . *",
    "our motivation for glimpses is to provide additional local context to our model to guide downstream , global pose estimation . in figure [ fig : glimpse_vs_heatmap ]",
    "we evaluate the performance of glimpses vs indicator masks ( i.e. heatmaps ) .",
    "figure [ fig : glimpse_vs_heatmap]b shows that glimpses do provide more context for the global pose prediction task .",
    "as the number of refinement iterations increases , using glimpses , the localization error for each joint is less than the error with heatmaps . by looking at figure [ fig : glimpse_vs_heatmap]a , it becomes apparent that heatmaps provide limited spatial information .",
    "the indicator mask is a way of encoding two - dimensional body part coordinates but does not explicitly provide local context information .",
    "glimpses are able to provide such context from the input image .",

    "our model is formulated as a deep discriminative model that attends to glimpses in the input . using a multi - task optimization objective ,",
    "our model is able to selectively predict partial poses by using a predicted visibility mask .",
    "this enables our model to iteratively improve its pose estimates by predicting occlusion and human joint offsets .",
    "we showed that our model achieves competitive performance on an existing depth - based pose estimation dataset and achieves state - of - the - art performance on a newly collected dataset containing 100k annotated depth images from several view points .",
