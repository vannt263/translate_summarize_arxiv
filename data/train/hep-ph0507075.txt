    "energy loss of a high @xmath0 hard parton travelling through low @xmath0 soft matter has long been recognized as a promising tool to study the initial high - density phases of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) @xcite . in @xcite , it has been suggested that a flow component transverse to the high @xmath0 parton trajectory would lead to increased energy loss as compared to the one in a static medium .",
    "descriptions of measured low @xmath0 spectra and hbt correlation radii for au - au collisions at rhic energies in terms of a thermalized medium characterized by a collective expansion ( flow ) velocity field at thermal decoupling are quite successful , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of charge independent two particle correlations seem to indicate that the distribution of jet secondaries is widened in longitudinal direction @xcite",
    ". a possible explanation could be that longitudinal flow leaves a characteristic imprint on the energy loss phenomenon .",
    "however , since jets propagate through the medium from the early onset of thermalization and lose energy mainly in the initial hot and dense phase , the knowledge of the flow profile at thermal decoupling is only of limited value .",
    "instead , one has to study a more generalized framework which allows to characterize the whole evolution of thermalized matter .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide such a study in a framework which has been shown to lead to a good description of the experimental data of transverse mass spectra and hbt correlations @xcite and which is flexible enough to test also various other evolution scenarios ( which are at present not favoured by the data ) . in the present paper we focus on the energy loss of the leading jet particle and",
    "leave predictions for the distortion of the jet cone to a subsequent publication .",
    "the parton s energy loss depends on the position of its production point @xmath2 and the angular orientation of it s trajectory @xmath3 . in order to determine the probability for a hard parton @xmath4 to lose the energy @xmath5",
    "while traversing the medium on it s trajectory , we make use of a scaling law @xcite which allows to relate the dynamical scenario to a static equivalent one whose density has been rescaled .",
    "this probability distribution of the energy loss @xmath5 is given as a functional of the distribution @xmath6 of gluons emitted into the jet cone @xcite :    @xmath7 \\delta\\left ( \\delta e - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i\\right ) \\exp\\left[-\\int d\\omega\\frac{di}{d\\omega } \\right].\\ ] ]    the explicit expressions for this quantity are different if one calculates @xmath6 under the assumption that multiple soft scattering processes or a few hard scattering processes are responsible for the energy loss . for both cases they can be found in @xcite . using these results",
    "we obtain @xmath4 from the key quantity of jet energy loss , namely the local transport coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "the transport coefficient characterizes the squared average momentum transfer from the medium to the hard parton per unit pathlength .",
    "since we consider a time - dependent inhomogeneous medium , this quantity depends on spacetime rapidity rapidity @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 and proper time @xmath11 .",
    "for simplicity we focus on central collisions and assume azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the transport coefficient is related to the energy density of the medium as @xmath12 . in the case of an ideal quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )",
    "one would expect @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it depends also on the jet trajectory @xmath14 ( production point @xmath15 and orientation @xmath16 ) . in order to calculate the transport coefficient in the presence of flow ,",
    "we follow the prescription suggested in @xcite and replace @xmath17 with @xmath18 \\frac{\\beta_\\perp^2}{1-\\beta_\\perp^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the spatial component of the flow field orthogonal to the parton trajectory .",
    "@xmath20 indicates the component of the energy - momentum tensor , where @xmath21 is orthogonal to the jet s trajectory . in the absence of any flow effects",
    "the original result @xmath22 is recovered .",
    "the transport coefficient enters the calculation of @xmath4 via @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are the linearly line - averaged characteristic gluon energy : @xmath25 and the time - averaged total transverse momentum squared : @xmath26 respectively @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the transport coefficient and subsequent @xmath27 , @xmath28 and finally @xmath4 requires a model of the fireball evolution which determines the local energy density and the flow profile .",
    "we discuss details of that model in the next section . in our calculation",
    "we average over all possible angles and production vertices , weighting the distribution of the jets with the nuclear overlap factor @xmath29 ( for central collisions ) with @xmath30 the nuclear density as a function of impact parameter * b * and longitudinal coordinate @xmath31 .",
    "this formalism sets the stage for the calculation of the nuclear modification factor . in the case of central collisions",
    "it is given by @xmath32    to obtain @xmath1 we use the formalism and averaging procedure as described above and calculate the inclusive charged hadrons production in lo pqcd .",
    "this amounts to folding the average energy loss probability into the factorized expression for hadron production ( for brevity we give schematical expressions , an explicit representation can be found in @xcite ) :    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    here , @xmath35 denotes the distribution of the parton @xmath36 inside the nucleus as a function of the parton momentum fraction @xmath37 and the hard scale @xmath38 of the scattering .",
    "likewise , @xmath39 denotes the fragmentation function of a parton @xmath40 into a hadron with the hadron taking the fraction @xmath31 of the parton momentum and a fragmentation scale @xmath41 which should be a typical hadronic scale @xmath42 .",
    "the expressions for the hard pqcd cross sections @xmath43 can e.g. be found in @xcite .",
    "we use the cteq6 parton distribution functions @xcite for the pp reference , the npdf set @xcite for production in nuclear collisions and the kkp fragmentation functions @xcite .    unless stated otherwise , we assume for the strong coupling @xmath44 in the calculation of @xmath4 in following .",
    "the fireball evolution enters this framework in the shape of @xmath45 and the flow profile @xmath46 . for the description of the evolution , we base our investigation on the formalism outlined in @xcite .",
    "the main assumption for the model is that an equilibrated system is formed a short time @xmath47 after the onset of the collision .",
    "furthermore , we assume that this thermal fireball subsequently expands isentropically until the mean free path of particles exceeds ( at a time @xmath48 ) the dimensions of the system and particles move without significant interaction to the detector .    for the entropy density at a given proper time",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath49 with @xmath50 the proper time as measured in a frame co - moving with a given volume element and @xmath51 two functions describing the shape of the distribution and @xmath52 a normalization factor .",
    "we use woods - saxon distributions @xmath53\\right ) \\\\ &   h(\\eta_s , \\tau ) = 1/\\left(1 + \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\eta_s - h_c(\\tau)}{\\eta_{\\text{ws}}}\\right]\\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] to describe the shapes for a given @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the ingredients of the model are the skin thickness parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the parametrizations of the expansion of the spatial extensions @xmath57 as a function of proper time . for a radially non - relativistic expansion and constant acceleration",
    "we find @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is obtained by integrating forward in @xmath54 a trajectory originating from the collision center which is characterized by a rapidity @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the longitudinal velocity of that trajectory . since the relation between proper time as measured in the co - moving frame and lab time",
    "is determined by the rapidity at a given time , the resulting integral is solved numerically ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath63 is determined in overlap calculations using glauber theory , the initial size of the rapidity interval occupied by the fireball matter .",
    "@xmath64 is a free parameter and we choose to use the transverse velocity @xmath65 and rapidity at decoupling proper time @xmath66 as parameters .",
    "thus , specifying @xmath67 and @xmath48 sets the essential scales of the spacetime evolution and @xmath55 and @xmath56 specify the detailed distribution of entropy density .    for transverse flow",
    "we assume a linear relation between radius @xmath10 and transverse rapidity @xmath68 with @xmath69 . in the following investigation",
    "we also test a flow profile @xmath70 .",
    "we allow for the possibility of accelerated longitudinal expansion which in general implies @xmath71 @xcite . here , @xmath72 denotes the longitudinal momentum rapidity of a given volume element .",
    "we can parametrize this mismatch between spacetime and momentum rapidity as a local @xmath73 which is a function of @xmath54 and @xmath74 .",
    "in the following we calculate @xmath6 in the multiple soft scattering approximation . the largest remaining uncertainty is the detailed choice of the parameter @xmath75 in the relation @xmath76 connecting transport coefficient and local energy density . as the highest temperature reached in the model evolution is only approximately two times the phase transition temperature @xmath77",
    "there is no a priori reason to assume that the ideal qgp value @xmath78 would be realized .",
    "hence , unless stated otherwise , we adjust @xmath75 such that the scenario _ without flow _ reproduces the large @xmath0 region ( we do not include any intermediate @xmath0 physics such as the cronin enhancement in this study ) and discuss changes induced by flow relative to this baseline .    as in @xcite",
    "we find that @xmath1 stays rather flat as a function of @xmath0 out to more than 50 gev .",
    "if the flattening which may be seen in the data can be trusted , a value of @xmath79 would lead to agreement with the data by the star collaboration for 5% central 200 agev au - au collisions @xcite ( see fig .  [ f-1 ] ) .",
    "since taking into account the effect of flow transverse to the jet axis is expected to increase energy loss , we choose the value @xmath80 as a baseline for the following investigation .    taking the transverse flow field into account we indeed observe increased supression , i.e. a reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "its magnitude shows some dependence on how the flow field depends on the radial position , we investigate @xmath81 and @xmath70 . in both cases the maximum transverse velocity",
    "is adjusted such that the measured @xmath82 and @xmath83 transverse mass spectra are reproduced .",
    "the emerging trend is that shuffling more flow towards the fireball edge leads to a greater reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "the reasons are rather involved : in order to experience transverse flow at all , the jet production vertex has to be away from the center of the transverse plane and the hard parton needs to propagate transverse to the local radial direction @xmath84 . on the other hand , hard partons produced close to the surface tend to escape before a significant amount of transverse flow could be generated . in the end , hard partons still in the medium at relatively late times will be close to the surface and experience additional energy loss if the flow profile leads to larger flow for the periphery .",
    "the main reason that the influence of transverse flow is much less pronounced than in the findings of @xcite is that in a realistic evolution scenario the transverse flow field does not build up instantaneously but rather develops gradually over time  as jet energy loss is a phenomenon predominantly sensitive to earlier times when the medium energy density is large , the spacetime region of the evolution where transverse flow is small is probed with @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] where we vary the amount of pre - equilibrium transverse flow @xmath85 at the fireball edge .",
    "( we take care that the final transverse flow agrees with the measured @xmath86 spectra by reducing the flow gained during the thermalized evolution accordingly ) . the amount of primordial transverse flow is expected to be small , but our results demonstrate clearly that we recover the comparatively large sensitivity seen in @xcite when we assume that a strong flow field is present _",
    "ab initio_.    however , just increasing the amount of primordial transverse expansion is hardly an appropiate comparison as in addition to the increased role of flow in the energy loss there is a rather trivial geometrical effect : the fast initial expansion of the fireball radius in the presence of primordial flow increases the average pathlength of hard partons in matter . in order to separate the two effects ,",
    "we show a calculation in which only the geometrical effect was taken into account but where we neglected the flow effect on @xmath87 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ] .",
    "in essence , for not too large primordial expansion velocities , geometry accounts for about half of the observed effect .",
    "note that a small primordial flow field can not be ruled out by current experimental evidence : one of the observables most sensitive to the initial state is the emission of thermal photons , but using the framework outlined in @xcite we observe that the increased radial flow tends to compensate the faster cooling by the increased expansion so that it is very difficult to distinguish the scenarios .",
    "in principle , in a non - boost invariant accelerated longitudinal expansion there can be a component of longitudinal flow transverse to the jet axis ( this is not so in a bjorken expansion where the hard parton is always co - moving with the surrounding matter in longitudinal direction ) .",
    "the magnitude of this component depends on the amount of longitudinal acceleration the system has undergone and the distance of the jet from midrapidity . in the present framework",
    ", it turns out that longitudinal flow leads to an additional 2% suppression at @xmath88 as compared to a situation in which only transverse flow is taken into account .",
    "this is small compared to other uncertainties , hence we do not discuss the effect of longitudinal flow with regard to additional energy loss any further .",
    "in @xcite , an estimate within a bjorken expansion model was made for the value of the parameter @xmath75 relating the transport coefficient and energy density .",
    "the analysis found @xmath89 far from the perturbative value @xmath78 valid for the ideal qgp .",
    "this is in fact consistently larger than our findings neglecting flow .",
    "the reason is that we do not use a bjorken expansion .",
    "this leads to stronger initial compression of matter ( and thus higher densities ) as well as slower subsequent cooling in our model . if we assume a bjorken expansion and neglect the effect of transverse flow on energy loss we find good agreement with the data for @xmath90 , quite consistent with the estimate in @xcite .",
    "however , if we take transverse flow into account in a moderately optimistic scenario , i.e. assuming a quadratic flow profile , a small value of primordial flow with @xmath91 and furthermore increase @xmath92 to 0.45 instead of 0.3 then we find that @xmath93 in fact gives a fair description of the data .",
    "thus , there may not be a huge quantitative discrepancy between pqcd predictions and the measured energy loss .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "we have investigated the effect of flow transverse to the jet direction on the energy loss of the leading parton .",
    "the net effect arises from an intricate interplay of several different effects , among them the quadratic pathlength dependence of energy loss which tends to emphasize the role of late times , the expansion and cooling matter which dilutes the system and emphasizes early times and gradual buildup of the transverse flow field over time .",
    "jets need to be produced away from the center of the transverse distribution in order to see a component transverse to the jet direction , but if they are produced too close to the edge they are likely to escape before flow could build up . as a result",
    ", we find great sensitivity to the presence of a primordial flow field .",
    "we have also studied the role of a longitudinal flow component orthogonal to the outgoing jet .",
    "we observe that away from midrapidity additional energy loss is induced if the jet is not longitudinally co - moving with the thermalized matter , however around midrapidity this effect turns out to be small compared to the influence of transverse flow .    if we include the additional energy loss induced by transverse flow in a favourable ( but still realistic ) scenario , we find that the ideal qgp relation @xmath94 gives a fair description of the data .",
    "thus , deviations from the ideal qgp energy loss may not be large even in the temperature range @xmath95 probed at rhic energies ."
