    "the band structure was calculated by numerically solving the scalar helmholtz equation for the electric field strength using the finite difference method described in ref .",
    "the two bands touch each other at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone depicted in fig .",

    "thus , photonic crystals can be used to investigate properties of graphene , as was done in analog experiments with microwave photonic crystals  @xcite and also with sonic crystals  @xcite .",

    "we consider here two of them , the extremal transmission and the formation of edge states  @xcite .",
    "both are properties of the waves propagating through a photonic crystal and crucially depend on the structure of the crystal edges .",
    "the dirac dispersion relation affects the transport properties of photonic crystals in a remarkable way .",
    "it was shown theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite that near the dirac point the intensity of electromagnetic waves transmitted through a photonic crystal is inversely proportional to the thickness of the crystal .",
    "this is different from the ballistic behavior and the exponential decay observed , respectively , in a band region and a gap region , but rather reminiscent of the diffusion behavior of waves traveling through a disordered medium .",

    "analog experiments with flat , cylindrical microwave cavities have been performed to model generic properties of quantum chaotic systems and of chaotic quantum scattering systems  @xcite .",
    "this is possible in a range @xmath14 of the excitation frequency @xmath4 , where the wave length is longer than twice the height of the cavity .",
    "there the electric field vector @xmath15 is perpendicular to the bottom and the top plates of the cavity and obeys the dirichlet boundary condition at the side walls of the cavity .",

    "the solutions of the helmholtz equation in free space were matched at the interface of the crystal to those of the dirac equation , which is applicable inside the photonic crystal in the vicinity of the dirac point .",
    "furthermore , conservation of @xmath47 , that is , snell s law , and of the flux through the boundary had to be taken into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] we show the data of the middle panel of fig .  [ fig5 ] in a double - logarithmic plot together with the prediction for their average behavior ( full line ) obtained by evaluating eqs .",

    "hence , since the thickness of a layer equals @xmath53 ( see fig .",

    "there berry and mondragon considered the dirac equation for massless spin one - half particles confined to a two - dimensional domain by introducing an infinite - mass term along its boundary , i.e. , a so - called neutrino billiard .",
    "close to the dirac frequency the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a photonic crystal can be effectively described by the dirac equation .",
    "thus , enclosing a microwave photonic crystal by a metallic frame , where the electric field strength obeys the dirichlet boundary condition and the outgoing current vanishes , corresponds to introducing an infinite - mass term in the associated dirac equation .",
    "accordingly , below @xmath64 this provides an experimental setup for the investigation of properties of relativistic quantum particles put inside an infinitely high potential barrier .",
    "the reflection of electromagnetic waves at the walls of the metallic box leads to an excitation of states in both the valleys at @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the associated band structure .",

    "the bottom panel of fig .",

    "this corroborates the necessity of the measurement of the spectra at superconducting conditions  @xcite in order to reduce dissipation of microwave power in the walls of the metallic cylinders and the resonator enclosing it , yielding considerably diminished widths of the resonances .",
    "still , in the vicinity of the dirac frequency the density of the resonances is low such that they can be resolved .",
    "in fact , there the local density of states tends to zero linearly with the distance @xmath72 of the excitation frequency @xmath4 from the dirac frequency @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "note that only in this frequency range the properties of the microwave dirac billiard are well described by the dirac equation , that is , only there it can simulate a dirac billiard .",

    "the corresponding wave functions could be measured and their properties , such as the occurence of edge states predicted for graphene billiards  @xcite , were investigated .",
    "the wave functions of a quantum billiard are directly related to the electric field strength distributions in the corresponding microwave billiard at the resonance frequencies  @xcite .",

    "a small perturbation body is inserted into the cavity .",
    "this induces a shift of the resonance frequencies the size of which depends on the electric and magnetic field strengths at the position of the perturbation body .",
    "since we are only interested in the intensity distribution of the wave functions of the corresponding dirac billiard , we used a perturbation body made from magnetic rubber  @xcite . in order to obtain the spatial distribution of the electric field strength the perturbation body was moved in the closed cavity in 2  mm steps between the @xmath76 rows of cylinders which are parallel to the long sides of the billiard .",

    "the structure of these intensity distributions resembles that of modes of the corresponding empty rectangular quantum billiard with one excitation parallel to the short billiard edge and several parallel to the long one .",
    "they are similar to the wave functions shown in fig .",
    "3  ( b ) of ref .",
    "the intensity distributions shown in panels  c  -  i are localized close to a long edge of the rectangular billiard , i.e. , there the intensity is highest and it is much smaller in the interior , especially in panels  e  -  h. at the long sides the photonic crystal terminates with straight edges , at the short sides with zigzag edges .",
    "these are close to , respectively , the zigzag edges and the armchair edges in the corresponding graphene billiard defined by the void structure of the photonic crystal .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the two sublattices are depicted as , respectively , red and blue dots .",
    "states which are localized near a short edge of the microwave billiard were not observed  @xcite , whereas altogether @xmath78 corresponding to a sequence of resonances around the dirac frequency were found to be localized near a long edge .",

    "there , @xmath79 consecutive states around the dirac point , which are all localized along a zigzag edge , so - called edge states , are predicted .",
    "note that the boundary conditions of the microwave billiard and the corresponding graphene billiard differ .",
    "for the latter the wave functions vanish on one sublattice at a zigzag edge , and on both at an armchair edge , whereas for the former they are zero along the side walls , which are arranged slightly apart from the edges of the graphene billiard ( see fig .",

    "they remind of the edge states observed experimentally  @xcite in graphene flakes , where electrons are confined by a potential barrier which , in distinction to that along the boundary of the dirac billiard , is of finite height , and recently also in a magnetic photonic crystal  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have observed experimentally the anomalous @xmath0 scaling behavior of the transmission of electromagnetic waves through a photonic crystal , which were excited at the dirac frequency and sent onto the crystal in directions close to the @xmath18 direction , that is , near a conically shaped singularity of the photonic band structure .",
    "furthermore , for the first time we implemented an experimental setup representing a microwave analog of a dirac billiard , that is a relativistic quantum billiard .",
    "we have observed experimentally in the vicinity of the dirac point states localized at edges of the dirac billiard , which are similar to the edge states occurring at zigzag edges in graphene flakes .",
    "these similarities between the properties of waves propagating through a photonic crystal and those of graphene corroborate experimentally that not only the linear dispersion relation but also the unusual properties of graphene associated with it are entirely due to the symmetry properties of its lattice .",
    "furthermore , this demonstrates that microwave billiards containing a photonic crystal provide an experimental setup for the investigation of properties of dirac billiards of different shapes and with varying boundary conditions .",
    "these systems are particularly suited for the investigation of the spectral properties of dirac billiards since the measurements can be performed with superconducting microwave billiards at liquid helium temperature .",
    "the aim is the study of the effect of the shape of a dirac billiard and the edge structure of the enclosed photonic crystal on its spectral properties .",
    "another interesting aspect concerning properties of the wave functions is the scarring phenomenon which has been seen numerically in graphene flakes with the shape of a stadium  @xcite .",
