    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) @xcite describes the coupling between atom and confined cavity mode of electromagnetic field by coherent interaction .",
    "it gives a great chance to reveal the nature of coherent interaction between matter and field , and to various application such as quantum information and quantum state engineering .",
    "the atom can be described by two - level system , and the cavity mode is described as quantized light field .",
    "the coupling between two - level system and quantized light field is described by the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , which describe the coupling strength as the speed of energy transfer between two subsystem ( here the excitation energy of the atom is close to energy level of cavity mode , which is called near resonance ) .",
    "when the energy level distribution of the atom is more complicated , three - level system or other multi - level system is needed to describe the atom .",
    "but the description of coupling is similar .",
    "some multi - level system give interesting phenomenon such as electromagnetical induced transparent @xcite .",
    "when there are more than one atom , the system can be described by tavis - cummings model @xcite , where n atoms are assumed to couple to the same cavity mode with identical coupling strength .",
    "this lead to enhance of the coupling strength to @xmath0 time .",
    "when the temperature of the system is lower than critical temperature , the n atoms couple with each other coherently and form bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in this case , all atoms have the same quantum state , which ensure the same coupling strength with cavity mode . as a result ,",
    "the tavis - cummings model is very appropriate for this system .",
    "a simpler model is to describe the bec of the n atoms by mean field theory .",
    "a dressed bec state @xcite and a dark state @xcite is investigated by the mean field theory description .",
    "when the energy level of cavity mode is much different from excitation energy of the atoms ( far off resonance ) , the coupling can be described by effective hamiltonian @xcite , which is given by solving the schrodinger equation of single atom and cavity mode .",
    "the dynamic property of dress bec state of far off resonance is also investigated under mean field theory method @xcite .    when the n atoms is trapped in an total optical trap , the spin freedom of the atoms is librated . when temperature is low enough ,",
    "spinor bec is form @xcite , which has much potential in application of quantum computer and quantum information @xcite .",
    "spinor bec can be described by either mean field theory or analytical express of the quantum state .",
    "a former work about fractional parentage coefficients ( fpcs ) gives a chance to describe spinor bec of spin-1 atoms in a simpler way @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomenon of spinor bec is spin mixing , where the average atomic number of each spin component evolute versus time @xcite . the pattern of time evolution is found to be decided by symmetric property and initial condition of the system @xcite .",
    "if the spinor bec is placed inside a far off resonant cavity , the atoms will couple to the cavity mode , which change the symmetric of the system as well as the effective coupling strength between atoms . as a result",
    ", the evolution of spin component is supposed to be modified . in this paper",
    ", we will deduce the effective hamiltonian to describe the far off resonant coupling of spinor bec and cavity mode , and figure the dressed state of spinor bec which is eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "and then we investigate the modification of spin mixing by the coupling .",
    "the spinor bec system is described by fpcs , which can give an analytical solution to the problem @xcite .",
    "the system we are going to investigate consist of @xmath1 @xmath2 atoms which are optically trapped to form a spinor bec , and located inside a high - q optical cavity .",
    "assume that there are only two optical modes of frequency @xmath3 , which are left and right circular polarization optical mode in the cavity .",
    "the two optical modes have opposite angular momentum @xmath4 along @xmath5 direction , which are indexed by @xmath6 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath2 is @xmath7 , and the lowest energy state of excited state of @xmath8 line is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 is smaller than and at the same scale of the frequency of @xmath10 transition @xmath11 , we can neglect other transition . as a result , the non - coupling hamiltonian of the n atoms with spin dependent interaction with the optical frequency removed is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is momentum of the ith atom , @xmath14 is atomic mass , @xmath15 is potential of external optical trap ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the @xmath9 state of the ith atom with spin component @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the @xmath7 state of the ith atom with spin component @xmath18 ) ; @xmath20 is spin dependent interaction between atoms , with @xmath21 being spin operator and @xmath22 being interaction constant @xcite .    since the q factor of the optical cavity is very high , and temperature is very close to zero",
    ", the decay of photon and non - coherent interaction between atoms and photon can be neglected .",
    "according to the selection rule , if the atom absorb ( emit ) one photon from(to ) the cavity , the allowed transitions have @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian of coupling between atom and cavity mode is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are annihilation and creation operators of optical modes of polarization @xmath6 , @xmath27 is the strength of the atom - field coupling .",
