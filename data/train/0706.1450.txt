    "nuclear astrophysics lies at the heart of understanding the origin of the physical world and our mere existence .",
    "one of its key questions is how and where did the chemical elements originate?. many challenging questions concerning the processes and mechanisms for nucleosynthesis are in the focus of modern research . in this respect ,",
    "supernovae and neutron stars are the most interesting objects to study .",
    "the first attempt to explain abundances of chemical elements in the solar system was made by geoge gamow in 1946 - 48 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "he proposed a mechanism that was based on a continuous building - up of chemical elements by neutron capture in the early universe .",
    "later it became clear that this mechanism can not explain the production of heavy elements because of very high specific entropy of the early universe , s / b@xmath2 , where s is the total entropy and b is the net baryon number .",
    "the present understanding of the element creation says that the lightest elements ( up to he , and , partly , li ) were formed during the first moments of the universe expansion , immediately after the big bang .",
    "heavier elements up to oxygen are predominantly produced in thermonuclear reactions in stars like our sun .",
    "elements up to iron and nickel could be produced in more massive stars .",
    "the origin of heavier elements such as gold and uranium remains in the focus of current research .",
    "it is widely believed that heavy elements were mostly synthesized in the course of supernova explosions in the so - called r - process ( subsequent neutron capture by stable and unstable nuclei , see a recent review @xcite ) .",
    "a type ii supernova explosion is one of the most spectacular events in astrophysics , with huge energy release of about @xmath3 erg or several tens of mev per nucleon @xcite . when the core of a massive star collapses , it reaches densities several times larger than the normal nuclear density @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the repulsive nucleon - nucleon interaction gives rise to a bounce - off of matter and formation of a shock wave propagating through the in - falling stellar material , predominantly fe .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) show that during the collapse and subsequent explosion the temperatures @xmath6 mev and baryon densities @xmath7 can be reached .",
    "unfortunately , these simulations do not produce successful explosions yet , even when neutrino heating and convection effects are included .",
    "this means that some important physics of this process is still missing .    besides supernova explosions , proto - neutron and neutron stars are interesting objects from a nuclear physics point of view .",
    "they are quite similar to huge , extremely neutron - rich macroscopic nuclei that gain additional stability and binding due to the gravitational force .",
    "neutron stars are very compact objects with a central density of about @xmath8 , a typical radius of @xmath9  km and masses up to 2 solar - masses .",
    "proto - neutron stars are newly - born neutron stars formed in the course of a supernova explosion .",
    "they are somewhat bigger than neutron stars and have temperatures up to 30 mev .",
    "the regime of interest for our considerations are baryon densities in the range @xmath10 , where very heavy and neutron - rich nuclei may be present @xcite .",
    "nuclear pasta phases , i.e. , nuclear matter in various geometries such as slabs and parallel plates , reminescent of _ pasta _ @xcite start at densites slightly above @xmath11 . in this regime",
    "the neutrons need to be taken into account .",
    "since the heaviest elements occuring in nature are uranium isotopes , there should have been corresponding extreme conditions for their creation and persistence , in supernova explosions , crusts of neutron stars , or other sites .",
    "thus we may wonder if very heavy and superheavy systems can and will be produced under such conditions too .",
    "how are the properties of such nuclear systems altered in dense environments ?",
    "the properties of nuclei in astrophysical environments have enjoyed continuous interest for over more than 30 years .",
    "the seminal work by negele and vautherin @xcite layed out the path for microscopic studies of nuclei in stellar environments , see e.g. refs .",
    "the investigation of the rich properties of nuclear systems under extreme conditions in astrophysical environments is on the rising path . since many astrophysical calculations , from r - process to dynamical simulations of supernova explosions ,",
    "depend on theoretical nuclear input , it is important to understand how nuclei subject to these special conditions differ from nuclei studied in the laboratory on earth .",
    "in this paper we focus on the physics of nuclei embedded in a dense electron gas .",
    "this investigation is important by itself as well as for further studies including the neutron gas .",
    "we consider nuclei across the perodic chart up to superheavy nuclei embedded in a wigner - seitz cell with constant electron density .",
    "the presence of the electrons will effect the location of the @xmath1-stability line and the proton dripline as well as decay modes such as @xmath0-decay and spontaneous fission .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ framework ] , we present the relativistic mean - field model which is employed in the calculations as well as the concept of the wigner - seitz cell and its concrete implementation for spherical and deformed nuclear systems . in section [ spherical_calculations ] , we discuss the @xmath1-equilibrium condition and present results for the @xmath1-stability line and the proton and neutron drip lines in the presence of electrons .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0-decay mode in heavy nuclei as a function of the electron fermi momentum is demonstrated in section [ alphadecay ] . in section [ deformedcalculations ] ,",
    "deformed nuclei are considered and spontaneous fission under the influcence of the electron background is studied . finally , in section [ conclusions ] we conclude and give an outline of future research directions .",
    "over the years self - consistent mean - field models have reached high predictive power .",
    "they can be applied from medium - light systems up to superheavy nuclei and to systems ranging from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line .",
    "they are based on the formulation of an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction meant to be employed in the hartree or hartree - fock treatment of nuclear systems .",
    "the modern way of formulating them is in terms of an energy functional that can incorporate terms which can not be constructed via a two- ( or three- or four- ) body force .    in this paper",
    "we employ the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model @xcite .",
    "the effective in - medium nucleon - nucleon interaction is parametrized via the exchange of several meson fields : scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath12 ) , vector - isovector ( @xmath13 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this model is based on an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath15 the field tensor for the @xmath16 meson is defined as @xmath17 , and similar definitions hold for the field tensors of the @xmath18 meson and the photon .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 are fitted to experimental data of nuclear ground - state observables .",
    "the masses of the @xmath18 and @xmath16 mesons are fixed at the experimental values , since the performance of the model is not quite sensitive to their values . as it is written down in the hartree approximation ,",
    "the meson fields are treated as classical potentials and the nucleons are represented by dirac spinors .",
    "the isoscalar - scalar @xmath12 meson delivers the intermediate - range attraction , while the isoscalar - vector @xmath16 meson is responsible for the short - range repulsion .",
    "the isovector - vector @xmath18 meson couples to the isovector nucleon density and thus parametrizes the isovector properties of the model . the photon is coupled in standard fashion . for all boson fields , no ( explicit ) exchange terms are taken into account .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these meson fields have only loose correspondence with the physical meson spectrum .",
    "mean - field models employing contact interactions between nucleons have a comparable predictive power for nuclear ground - state observables and excited states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 denote occupation probabilities of the nucleon states and originate from the treatment of pairing .",
    "we employ bcs pairing with a density - independent @xmath21-force , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . in time - reversal even - even systems , only the time components of the vector mesons are non - zero .",
    "proton and neutron states are not allowed to mix , hence only the third components of the isovector - vector @xmath18 field associated with @xmath22 survives .",
    "the single - particle equation for the nucleons reads @xmath23 \\psi = \\epsilon \\gamma_0 \\psi\\ ] ] the binding properties of nuclear matter and nuclei are generated from the strong scalar and vector fields , @xmath24  mev , @xmath25  mev , which add up to a normal nucleon potential @xmath26  mev .",
    "they add up with the same sign to generate the strong spin - orbit potential in nuclei , which ( in the nonrelativistic limit ) is given by @xmath27 this spin - orbit force emerges from the covariant formalism with the right sign and magnitude without introducing additional parameters .",
    "this is an important consequence of the relativistic description .    in order to account for the electron background ,",
    "we modify the source term of the photon field by adding the electron density , i.e. @xmath28 which is the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath29 .",
    "further down we discuss the concrete implementation in different symmetries .",
    "all other equations remain the same as in vacuum .",
    "calculations are performed in coordinate space , but the derivatives are performed as matrix multiplications in fourier space .",
    "we employ the mean - field parametrization nl3 in these studies @xcite which delivers accurate values for nuclear ground - state properties . furthermore , since the external electron background couples only electromagnetically to nucleons , no additional parameters need to be introduced , and no readjustment of the present parameters is needed .",
    "in this paper we study properties of nuclei embedded in a uniform electron gas at zero temperature .",
    "the calculations are performed within the wigner - seitz ( ws ) approximation by dividing the system into ws cells , each containing only one nucleus and the number of electrons equal to the nuclear charge z , see fig .",
    "[ wscell ] for an illustration .",
    "the construction of the ws cell is aimed at an approximate and convenient segmentation of an ensemble of nuclei surrounded by the uniform background of electrons .",
    "its construction should ensure that the physics contained in the wigner - seitz cell is to an optimally large degree isolated from the surrounding .",
    "this requires , for example , charge neutrality of the cell",
    ". however , there could be also other requirements which minimize the electrostatic interactions with neighbouring cells ( see below ) .",
    "recently the validity of the ws approximation for the inner neutron - star crust has been discussed , e. g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at electron densities considered in this work ,",
    "the coulomb potential due to the nucleus is a small perturbation compared to the fermi energy of the electrons .",
    "thus the electrons will only be weakly affected by the presence of the nucleus which justifies the approximation of constant density .    in the numerical implementation",
    ", however , we use a fermi - type distribution of the electron density with a smooth boundary .",
    "the reason is that on a spherical grid in coordinate space , the cell radius can not be fixed exactly ( it is limited to any value that is a multiple of the grid spacing @xmath30 ) .",
    "a smooth surface region allows us to realize the electron shell for any grid spacing and radius .",
    "the parameters of the shell are chosen to satisfy the charge neutrality condition @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total charge density . since in the computer code",
    "the derivatives are calculated in fourier space , the numerical realization of the smooth surface region is not very sensitive to the chosen grid - spacing .",
    "this construction of the electron density allows us to calculate nuclei throughout the nuclear chart without introducing artifical jumps in the energy caused by a step - like change of the ws cell radius .      for a given nuclear charge z the ws cell radius @xmath33",
    "is uniquely determined by the charge neutrality requirement @xmath34 expressing the electron density in terms of the electron fermi momentum @xmath35 , @xmath36 one can write the cell radius as @xmath37 the parametrization with a smooth surface , as used in this work , is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the background electron density , @xmath40 is adjusted in order to fullfill charge neutrality , and @xmath41 is the diffuseness parameter of the distribution , taken to be @xmath42  fm .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is chosen such that the charge density is dropping from @xmath43 to @xmath44 of its value at @xmath45 within the diffuseness interval @xmath46 .",
    "we have checked that the results , in particular the differences of nuclear binding energies , are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath41 . the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] )",
    "has to be solved numerically .",
    "while these calculations can be performed quite easily for high electron densities , for low electron densities when the ws cell radius becomes quite large , numerical problems arise .",
    "for example , for a tin nucleus , at @xmath47  @xmath48 , the ws cell radius is @xmath49  fm , while for @xmath50  @xmath48 it corresponds to @xmath51  fm .",
    "an alternative way of calculating the effect of the electron gas is to add the potential of a homogenously charged sphere of electrons to the electric potential of the proton charge distribution , i.e. , first calculate the proton electric potential , @xmath52 then add the potential due to electrons , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the solution of the poisson equation for the proton charge density .",
    "the electric potential caused by the uniform background of electrons reads @xmath55 , \\quad r < r_{c } \\\\",
    "\\frac{-z e}{4\\pi r } , \\quad r \\geq r_{c } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{elec_pot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ pb_pot ] , the two different ways of calculating the total electric potential , eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) , lead to identical electric potentials ( apart from the correction due to the smooth surface region in eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) ) and , therefore , to the same structure of the nucleus .",
    "this demonstrates consistency and accuracy of the treatment of the electron background in our numerical calculations .",
    "it is clear that the total energy of the cell should include the interaction energy of the electrons with the electromagnetic field , which does not appear when the electrons are employed as an external potential , eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) .",
    "this interaction energy can be easily calculated for the case when the ( spherical ) electron and proton charge distributions are replaced by step - functions : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the cell radius and nuclear radius , respectively .",
    "an elementary calculation yields for the total electrostatic energy of the cell @xmath59 this expression has the correct behavior at @xmath60 , when it goes to the coulomb energy of an isolated nucleus , and at @xmath61 , when it gives zero ( electron and proton charges fully compensate each other ) .",
    "one can see that the coulomb energy of the nucleus is screened by the electrons .",
    "this screening effect is very significant even at moderate electron densities .",
    "for instance , at @xmath62 the screening effect is about @xmath63 . as we shall see below",
    ", this change should lead to important modifications of the decay channels involving charged particles , such as @xmath0-decay and fission .",
    "the influence of the spherical electron cloud on the self - consistent proton potential is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ pb_pot2 ] for @xmath64pb .",
    "we note that this nucleus , in the presence of electrons , is not stable anymore and would undergo electron capture .",
    "it is displayed here to demonstrate the effect of the attractive interaction between electrons and protons .",
    "the electron background leads to a downward shift of the potential but its structure remains basically unchanged within the nuclear volume .",
    "however , the principle difference from the pure coulombic potential is evident at larger distances where the electric potential reaches zero ( and zero derivative ) at the boundary of the wigner - seiz cell .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ pb_pot2 ] for @xmath65  @xmath48 and the cell radius @xmath66  fm .",
    "this behavior is a result of the charge - neutrality condition which makes the electric field vanish outside the cell .",
    "we can conclude that at fixed @xmath67 and @xmath68 the nuclear structure , in particular the single - particle level spacings , remains to good approximation unaltered by the presence of the electrons . as an example , we note that the proton rms radius in the heavy nucleus @xmath69pu decreases by approximately @xmath70 when adding electrons with @xmath71 .",
    "the fermi energy of the protons also experiences a shift downward equal to the amount given by the additional electric potential .",
    "the neutron single - particle properties are only minimally altered , as is expected .",
    "the proton single - particle levels of @xmath64pb are shown in fig .",
    "[ pb_levels ] for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the downward shift of all levels is approximately 10 mev .",
    "we note that while the level density as such remains the same , the positioning of the levels with respect to the continuum threshold has changed . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the number of proton states which correspond to bound orbitals has increased , and the density of states close to the continuum has increased .",
    "furthermore , the proton separation energies have become larger .",
    "these changes in the single - particle spectra could affect , for example , nuclear reactions , in particular electron and neutron capture rates .    the total charge density for the doubly - magic lead nucleus embedded in an electron gas in displayed in fig .",
    "[ pb_chargedens ]",
    ". the negative contribution due to the electrons and the downward shift in the interior of the nucleus are clearly visible .      for spherical nuclei the spherical shape of the ws cell is the obvious choice . in this case , the electric field and its derivative vanish on the cell boundary so that different cells do not experience coulomb interactions .",
    "however , when we investigate deformed nuclei , there are several possibilities of dealing with such a situation .",
    "one possibility is to employ again a spherical ws cell , with the deformed nucleus sitting in its center .",
    "this again corresponds to a constant electron background that is not affected very much by the presence of the nucleus .",
    "however , due to the deformed proton distribution , the quadrupole moment of the whole cell is nonzero in this case .",
    "this means that the neighboring cells will experience quadrupole - quadrupole interactions .",
    "we think that for the description of deformed nuclei it is more reasonable to use deformed cells too .",
    "therefore , we consider axially deformed spheroidal cells with the excentricity determined by the condition of vanishing quadrupole moment .    the quadrupole moment of a given charge distribution is defined as @xmath74    in our case @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we adjust the shape of the electron spheroid such that @xmath76 . for the electron fermi momenta considered in this work",
    "the electron charge density is considerably smaller than the proton charge density at the center of the nucleus , and therefore the electron spheroid has larger axes . at the same excentricity , this would result in a larger negative quadrupole moment of the electron cloud as compared with the positive quadrupole moment of protons .",
    "thus , to balance these two contributions , the electron spheroid must have a smaller excentricity than the proton one .",
    "the realization of the deformed ws cell is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pu240largebeta ] for the ground state and for a largely - deformed state of @xmath69pu .",
    "the latter shape is chosen arbitrarily to illustrate the point concerning the shape of the ws cells . at the electron fermi momentum @xmath71",
    "the equivalent spherical ws cell radius is 17.5 fm . in the ground state of plutonium with a deformation of @xmath77 ,",
    "the electron cloud is almost spherical . at the deformation of @xmath78",
    ", the electron background clearly has a spheroidal shape .",
    "still , its excentricity is much smaller than the one of the plutonium nucleus which is much more elongated .",
    "this shape corresponds to the nucleus behind the second barrier ( see below ) . note that this nucleus will eventually fission through the asymmetric barrier which is energetically favorable",
    "however , the spheroidal shape used in our study can be used for axially - symmetric nuclei and , acoordingly , only for symmetric fission .",
    "generalizations of this parametrizations would involve more complicated shapes allowing also for hexadecupole and octupole degrees of freedom .",
    "for the superheavy nucleus @xmath79 , the corresponding charge densities are shown in fig [ 120172largebeta ] .",
    "again , the ( spherical ) ground - state and a state at large deformation are displayed .",
    "this nucleus exhibits a semi - bubble @xcite shape corresponding to a depletion of the baryon in its center that changes with deformation .",
    "in this section we analyze how the nuclear @xmath1-stability valley and the proton and neutron drip lines change with increasing electron fermi momentum . as shown before , the proton single - particle potential experiences a constant downward shift . this downward shift of the proton potential and hence the gap between proton and neutron chemical potentials is the reason for the new @xmath1-stability line .    in the following , we investigate the possibility of certain decay modes of nuclei in the electron background .",
    "in particular , electron capture by nuclei leads to a shift of the stability line to the neutron - rich side .",
    "[ beta ] in the presence of electrons the equilibrium condition with respect to weak decays ( @xmath80 ) reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are neutron and proton chemical potentials calculated within the framework of the rmf model , i.e. @xmath84 the electron chemical potential is simply given by @xmath85 where the contribution of the electrostatic potential has been neglected since it cancels out with the corresponding contribution from the proton in eq .",
    "( [ betastab ] ) .",
    "if @xmath86 holds , neutrons can decay into available proton states with the electron going on the top of the fermi distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath87 , protons can capture electrons from the fermi distribution and occupy neutron states .",
    "only when the condition in eq .",
    "( [ betastab ] ) is fulfilled , nuclear systems are stable with respect to these decay modes . note that this relation becomes the well - known condition for @xmath1-stability in vacuum , @xmath88 , for @xmath89 .    for zero temperature ,",
    "the proton and neutron chemical potentials coincide with their fermi energies .",
    "we note that this correspondence is not uniquely defined anymore for systems with pairing , where the effective fermi energy is determined to yield @xmath90 , but can lie somewhere between the last level contributing with nonzero occupancy and the next one .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the ( n , z ) dependence of the stability line , instead of eq .",
    "( [ betastab ] ) we employ the criterion @xmath91 where @xmath92  mev .    in fig .",

    "we show also the proton and neutron drip lines ( see below ) . as @xmath35 increases",
    ", the line of @xmath1-stability is shifted more and more to the neutron - rich side , i.e. the presence of electrons stabilizes neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this shift is so strong already for @xmath93 that @xmath1-stability is reached only in the region of the two - neutron drip line .",
    "this means that the @xmath1-equilibrium is reached only when free neutrons appear in the system .",
    "the neutron and proton drip lines are defined by the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that these nuclei are unstable with respect to weak decays so that the condition of @xmath1-equilibrium , eq .",

    "are related to the two - proton separation energies by @xmath100 .",
    "the neutron drip line is the same for all cases shown in fig .",
    "[ lines1 ] since its position is not affected by the presence of the electrons .",
    "this follows from the fact that the neutron single - particle potential is not affected by the changes in the proton potential .",
    "thus the neutron single - particle states are ( almost completely ) identical in all cases and the neutron drip line does not change .",
    "however , the results on the neutron drip line need to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "firstly , the calculations here are performed in spherical symmetry and deformation effects will wash out some of the strong shell effects appearing in these calculations . secondly , we employ bcs pairing which overestimates the coupling to continuum states and the pairing contribution of the loosely bound orbitals . for nuclei close to or at the neutron drip line , full hartree - fock - bogolyubov calculations should be performed . however , since here we are not interested in the precise details of the position of the neutron drip line , the bcs calculations can give us useful information on the relation between the line of @xmath1 stability and the neutron drip region .",

    "[ lines1 ]  displayed separately in fig .",
    "[ lines2 ] . as expected , this drip line shifts to more proton - rich nuclei as the electron fermi momentum increases due to the additional binding of protons produced by the electron background .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath101 , the proton drip line is very close to the @xmath102 condition .",
    "we can summarize our findings by stating that the region of nuclei between the conditions of proton drip and @xmath1 stability has increased .",
    "in this section we investigate the influence of the electron background on @xmath0-decay of nuclei .",
    "the @xmath103 value of the reaction is defined as @xmath104 and corresponds approximately , neglecting nuclear recoil , to the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 particle leaving the nucleus . in the considered environment ,",

    "the calculation of the @xmath0-decay lifetimes in the presence of electrons is not completely trivial .",
    "there are two competing effects .",
    "as seen above , the @xmath103 value is lowered due to the increased nuclear binding caused by electrons , which alone ( for the same barrier ) could increase the lifetime .",
    "we have also seen that the presence of the electrons leads to screening and modification of the coulomb potential , see eq .",

    "it is interesting that the potential energy surface is affected in a different way compared to the case of plutonium .",
    "the reasons are related to the fact that the barrier starts out from a spherical minimum , and that the charge number in this nucleus is much larger so that the total contribution of the coulomb energy to the total energy is strongly increased compared to plutonium .",

    "the calculation of the axial barrier gives us only partial information on the principal impact of the electron background on the fission barrier .",
    "the actual fission path , however , might deviate quite strongly from this path , and for these heavy systems fissioning through the triaxial plane is rather probable .      as discussed in section [ wssph ] , due to the screening of the electrons the coulomb energy of nuclei",

    "this work is in progress now . at this stage",
    "we can only point out that due to the screening of the coulomb potential the fission barrier is altered and the q value will decrease .",
    "we expect that the latter trend is more important so that the net effect is suppression of spontaneous fission .",

    "we employ the criterion that in addition to the total charge also the total electric quadrupole moment of a cell should vanish .",

    "the neutron drip line is not altered by the presence of the electrons since the neutron single - particle potential remains ( to a very good approximation ) unaffected .",
    "we have found that in a dense electron background decay modes such as @xmath0-decay and spontaneous fission are suppressed .",
    "our calculations show that the @xmath0 decay half lives decrease a a function of the electron fermi momentum @xmath35 until they get stabilized for larger @xmath35 .",
    "a general trend is that the @xmath159 values of those decay modes decrease with increasing electron density .",
    "we have also calculated the potential energy surface as a function of the electron fermi momentum within the framework of the self - adjusting axial wigner seitz cell .",
    "we have found that only for very large electron fermi momenta a change is occuring for the inner axial barrier and the energetic position of the isomeric state .",
    "this could hint again at stabilization of the fission mode for high electron densities .",

    "the nuclei , which otherwise would be unstable , can provide a bridge to the island of superheavy elements .",
    "we are planning to study this possibility in the future .",
    "if long - lived or even stable superheavy nuclei exist , they could be created in such an environment and later ejected into space . then one can try to search for such superheavy nuclei in cosmic rays .",
