    "the distribution of stellar masses and the overall star formation rate depend critically on the @xmath4established by turbulence .",
    "it is therefore essential to measure the @xmath4 in the molecular clouds that produce stars .",
    "recent works have used simulations to characterize the density distribution from different driving modes of turbulence @xcite .",
    "these studies determined that there is a relation between the mode of turbulent driving and the width of the lognormal density distribution , with the lognormal width ( variance ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 with sound speed @xmath7 and alfven speed @xmath8 , and the logarithmic density contrast @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 describes the coupling between the density contrast and the mach number @xcite .",
    "a conceptual justification for the parameter is that for solenoidal ( curly ) driving , only 1 of the 3 available spatial directions is directly compressed ( longitudinal waves ) and thus @xmath11 . under compressive ( convergent or divergent ) driving , the gas is compressed in all three spatial directions , which gives @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that simulations driven with these modes achieve @xmath10 values consistent with this interpretation .",
    "all of the above turbulence - based theories of star formation explicitly assume a lognormal form for the density probability distribution @xmath13 of the gas .",
    "however , recent simulations @xcite and theoretical work @xcite have shown that the assumption of a lognormal distribution is often very poor ; theoretical intermittent distributions and simulated @xmath4s deviate from lognormal by orders of magnitude at the extreme ends of the density distributions .",
    "since these theories all involve an integral over the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) , deviation from the lognormal distribution can drastically affect the overall predicted star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and initial mass function .",
    "note that the modifications to the @xmath4driven by gravitational collapse are unlikely to change the sfr or the imf since gravitational overdensities have already separated from the turbulent flow that created them @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial that studies of turbulence focus on clouds that are not yet dominated by gravitational collapse ( such as the cloud selected for this study ) in order to study the initial conditions of star formation .    while simulations are powerful probes of wide ranges of parameter space , no simulation to date is capable of including all of the physical processes and spatial scales relevant to turbulence and star formation .",
    "observations are required to provide additional constraints on properties of interstellar turbulence and guide simulators toward the most useful conditions and processes to include .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide some of the first observational constraints on the mode of turbulent driving using extinction - derived column density distributions .",
    "they measure the parameter @xmath14 , indicating that there is a ` natural ' mix of solenoidal and compressive modes .",
    "a ` natural ' mixture ( a 2:1 mixture ) of solenoidal and compressive modes injected by the turbulent driver , i.e. , a forcing ratio @xmath15 , yields @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 implies an enhanced compressive forcing component relative to the naturally mixed case ( see figure 8 in * ? ? ?",
    "formaldehyde , @xmath0 , is a unique probe of density in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "like co , it is ubiquitous , with a nearly constant abundance wherever co is found @xcite .",
    "the lowest excitation transitions of @xmath18at 2 and 6 cm can be observed in absorption against the cosmic microwave background or any bright continuum source @xcite .",
    "the ratio of these lines is strongly sensitive to the local density of @xmath19 , but it is relatively insensitive to the local gas temperature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0line ratio has a direct dependence on the density that is nearly independent of the column density .",
    "this feature is unlike typical methods of molecular - line based density inference in which the density is inferred to be greater than the critical density of the detected transition .",
    "however , the particular property of the @xmath0densitometer we exploit here is its ability to trace the _ mass - weighted _ density of the gas .",
    "typical density measurements from @xmath1or dust measure the total mass and assume a line - of - sight geometry , measuring a _ volume - weighted _ density , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0densitometer is sensitive to the density at which most mass resides ; this fact will be demonstrated in greater detail in section [ sec : turbulenceh2co ] .",
    "the volume- and mass- weighted densities have different dependencies on the underlying density distributions , so in clouds dominated by turbulence , if we have measurements of both , we can constrain the shape of the @xmath4and potentially the driving mode .    in @xcite",
    ", we noted that the @xmath0densitometer revealed @xmath19densities much higher than expected given the cloud - average densities from @xmath1observations .",
    "the densities were too high to be explained by a lognormal density distribution consistent with that seen in local clouds .",
    "however , this argument was made on the basis of a statistical comparison of `` cloud - average '' versus @xmath0-derived density measurements and left open the possibility that we had selected especially dense clouds .",
    "in this paper , we use the example of a single cloud to demonstrate that the high @xmath0densities must be caused by the shape of the density distribution and to infer the shape of this distribution .",

    "observations were carried out in a single pointing position - switched mode with 3 and 5.5  offsets for the arecibo and gbt observations respectively ; no absorption was found in the off position of the observations described here .",

    "both are very bright radio continuum sources , and two foreground gmcs are easily detected in both @xmath0absorption and @xmath1emission .",
    "figure [ fig : w49fullspec ] shows the spectrum dominated by w49 itself , but with clear @xmath0foreground absorption components .",
    "the continuum levels subtracted from the spectra are 73 k at 6 cm and 11 k at 2 cm for the south component ( g43.16 - 0.03 ) , and 194 k at 6 cm and 28 k at 2 cm for the north component ( g43.17 + 0.01 ) .",
    "we focus on the `` foreground '' line at @xmath26 @xmath22 , since it is not associated with the extremely massive w49 region , which is dominated by gravity and stellar feedback rather than pure turbulence .",

    "additional @xmath0spectra of surrounding sources that are both bright at 81100 @xmath27and within the @xmath1contours of the cloud have @xmath0@xmath28detections at @xmath29 or @xmath30 @xmath22 .",
    "the detections of dense gas at these other velocities , and corresponding nondetections of @xmath28at 40 @xmath22 , indicate that the star - forming clumps apparent in the infrared in figure [ fig:40kmscloud ] are not associated with the 40 @xmath22cloud .",

    "the detected @xmath1and @xmath0lines are fairly narrow , with @xmath0fwhm ranging from @xmath35 @xmath22and @xmath1widths from @xmath36 @xmath22 , where the largest line - widths are from averaging over the largest scales in the cloud .",
    "the @xmath1lines are 50100% wider than the @xmath0lines .",
    "this greater linewidth is due to high optical depth in the more common isotopologues , since @xmath37has the same linewidth as @xmath0and @xmath38is @xmath39 wider ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 4 ) .",
    "the highest @xmath1contours are observed as a modest infrared dark cloud in spitzer 8 @xmath27images , but no dust emission peaks are observed at 500 @xmath27(herschel ; * ? ? ? * ) or 1.1 mm ( bolocam ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) associated with the dark gas .",
    "this is an indication that the cloud is not dominated by gravity  no massive dense clumps are present within this cloud .",
    "the cloud s density is the key parameter we aim to measure , so we first determine the cloud - averaged properties based on @xmath11 - 0 .",
    "the cloud has mass in the range @xmath40 @xmath41 in a radius @xmath42 pc as measured from the integrated @xmath1map using an optical depth estimate and abundance from @xcite , so its mean density is @xmath43 @xmath44assuming spherical symmetry ( see appendix [ sec : caveats ] ) . if we instead assume a cubic volume , as is done in simulations , the mean density is lower by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite report a mass @xmath46 and @xmath47 pc , yielding a density @xmath48 @xmath44 , which is consistent with our estimates .",
    "@xcite break the cloud apart into 3 separate objects for their analysis , grsmc 43.04 - 0.11 , grsmc 43.24 - 00.31 , and grsmc 43.14 - 0.36 .",
    "all three have the same velocity to within 1 @xmath22 , but they show slight discontinuities in position - velocity space .",
    "these discontinuities are morphologically consistent with gaps seen in turbulent simulations , validating our assessment of the cloud as a single object , but as a maximally conservative estimate we use the density of the northmost `` clump '' grsmc 43.04 - 0.11 , which overlaps our target line of sight , as an upper limit .",
    "it has density @xmath49 , but we use @xmath50 @xmath44as a slightly more conservative limit to allow for modest uncertainties in optical depth , radius , and abundance .",
    "in order to infer densities using the @xmath0densitometer , we use the low - temperature collision rates given by @xcite with radex using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite to build a grid of predicted line properties covering 100 densities @xmath51 @xmath44 , 10 temperatures @xmath52 k , 100 column densities @xmath53 @xmath54 , and 10 @xmath19ortho - to - para ratios @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath0densitometer measurements are shown in figure [ fig : h2codensg43 ] .",
    "the figures show optical depth spectra , given by the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the spectrum ( with both the line and continuum included ) and @xmath58 is the measured continuum , both in kelvin .",
    "the cosmic microwave background temperature is added to the continuum since @xmath0can be seen in absorption against it , though toward w49 it is negligible .",
    "since the w49 lines of sight are clearly on the outskirts of the foreground cloud , not through its center , it is unlikely that these lines of sight correspond to a centrally condensed density peak ( e.g. , a core ) .",
    "the comparable line ratios observed through two different lines of sight separated by @xmath59 pc supports this claim , since if either line was centered on a core , we would observe a much higher @xmath28optical depth .",
    "we performed fits of the optical depth spectra to each line independently using a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach @xcite .",
    "in both lines of sight , we found that the centroids and widths agreed ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) . from this point on , we discuss only the g43.17 + 0.01line of sight ( @xmath60 @xmath22 in figure [ fig:40kmscloud ] ) , since it is well - fit by a single component and has high signal - to - noise . since both lines of sight sample the same co cloud , all of the measurements below are most strongly constrained by the g43.17 + 0.01line of sight and the g43.16 - 0.03line of sight provides no additional information .",

    "assuming the same abundance as above , @xmath104 , the hopkins distribution is incompatible with our observations for the @xmath105 relations considered in @xcite and the other @xmath98 values and relations explored in figure [ fig : distributions]b .",
    "figure [ fig : distributions]a shows how the hopkins and lognormal distributions differ ; the hopkins distribution is more sharply peaked and includes less gas above its peak density .",
    "the incompatibility with our observations arises because the hopkins distribution produces lower mass - weighted densities than the lognormal .",

    "independent of the form of the hopkins distribution chosen , it is more restrictive than the lognormal distribution .      the restrictions on @xmath87 and @xmath10 using either the lognormal or hopkins density distribution are indications that compressive forcing must be a significant , if not dominant , mode in this molecular cloud .",
    "however , there are no obvious signs of cloud - cloud collision or interaction with a supernova that might directly indicate what is driving the turbulence .",
    "most of the systematic uncertainties tend to require a _ greater _ @xmath10 value , while we have already inferred a lower limit that is moderately higher than others have observed @xcite . temperatures in gmcs are typically 10 - 20 k , and we assumed 10 k : warmer temperatures increase the sound speed and therefore decrease the mach number . if the cloud is warmer , the @xmath10 values again must be higher to account for the measured @xmath87 .",
    "magnetic fields similarly have the inverse effect of @xmath10 on @xmath87 , with decreasing @xmath110 requiring higher @xmath10 for the same @xmath87 .",
    "the only systematic that operates in the opposite direction is the abundance of @xmath18 .",
    "lower abundance shifts all curves in figure [ fig : lvgsmooth ] up and to the right , which decreases @xmath87 and therefore allows for a lower @xmath10 for fixed mach number .",
    "however , abundances lower than @xmath111 are rarely observed except in galactic cirrus clouds @xcite and highly shocked regions like the cirumnuclear disk around sgr a * @xcite , so the measurements in table [ tab : datafits ] should bracket the allowed values . while we only explored two possible abundances in detail , note that the @xmath87 values derived from the lognormal distribution vary little over half - dex changes in abundance ( table [ tab : datafits ] ) , indicating that this measurement at least is robust to abundance assumptions .",
    "we explore these caveats and others in more detail in the appendix .",
    "we demonstrate the use of a novel method of inferring parameters of the density probability distribution function in a molecular cloud using @xmath0densitometry in conjunction with @xmath1-based estimates of total cloud mass . we have measured the standard deviation of the lognormal turbulence density distribution @xmath3 and placed a lower limit on the compressiveness parameter @xmath17 .",
    "both measurements are robust to the assumed cloud density , @xmath0abundance , and other assumptions .",
    "our data show evidence for compressively driven turbulence in a non - star - forming giant molecular cloud .",
    "since this cloud represents a typical molecular cloud , it is likely that compressive driving is a common feature of all molecular clouds .",
    "this new method opens the possibility of investigating the drivers of turbulence more directly , e.g.  by measuring the shape of the density pdf both within spiral arms and in the inter - arm regions .",
    "the main requirements for applying this technique are a moderately accurate measurement of the mean cloud density , which can easily be provided by @xmath1surveys such as the grs , and a high signal - to - noise measurement of the 2 cm and 6 cm @xmath0lines .",
    "a precise measurement of the mach number of the cloud will allow _ measurements _ of @xmath10 rather than the limits we have presented here .",
    "investigations of the predicted observed velocity dispersion and line strengths in both @xmath0and @xmath1 in simulations of turbulent clouds should provide the details needed to take this next step .",
    "finally , the general approach of accounting for a density distribution by averaging over the contribution to the line profile at each density should be generally applicable to any molecular line observations as long as the lines are optically thin .",

    "we explore the various caveats and assumptions that have been treated above in more detail here .",
    "the precise density measurements presented here are based on large velocity gradient approximations @xcite for the escape probability of line radiation from the cloud .",
    "this method is widely used but remains an approximation . in the case of @xmath0",
    ", it has been tested with a variety of codes @xcite but is subject to uncertainties in the velocity gradient and system geometry . however , in the case of the observations in this paper , the lines were observed in the optically thin regime , and the lvg approximation should not affect our results .",
    "the collision rates of @xmath0with p-@xmath19 , o-@xmath19 , and he are estimated based on computer simulations of the particles . @xcite improved upon the measurements of @xcite , bringing the typical collision rate uncertainty down from @xmath112 in the he - based approximation to @xmath113 using full models of ortho and para @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite noted that the differences they observed from the @xcite results were @xmath114 , indicating that the methods they use are at least convergent & self - consistent to within @xmath115 .",
    "@xcite reported the results of using modified collision rates assuming a 50% error and noted that the resulting errors in the @xmath19density were , in the worst case , @xmath116 dex . with the improved @xcite collision rates ,",
    "the model uncertainties are no longer dominated by collision rate uncertainties .",
    "abundance remains a serious concern , as most studies of @xmath18abundance do not observe multiple transitions and therefore do not constrain the relative level populations .",
    "there are also general difficulties in measuring absolute abundance of molecules , as the absolute column of @xmath19is rarely known with high accuracy .",
    "most abundance measurements are above @xmath117 @xcite , except near sgr a * @xcite and in galactic cirrus clouds @xcite where it is generally observed to have @xmath118 .",
    "these measurements dictated the abundance boundaries we used in our analysis .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath19is a significant uncertainty in the models , since para-@xmath19is more effective at `` refrigerating '' the @xmath0molecules .",
    "values of the ortho - to - para ratio @xmath119 favor lower densities by @xmath120 dex , but we have used these lower densities in our analysis , and therefore our results are conservative . however ,",
    "if the ortho - to - para ratio is in reality close to zero , the density pdf must be wider and @xmath10 correspondingly higher .",
    "the `` covering factor '' of foreground clouds in front of background illumination sources is , in general , a major concern when performing absorption measurements . for the clouds presented in this work ,",
    "the absorbing region is much larger than the background , as evidenced by the two lines - of - sight with similar optical depth ratios .",
    "however , for more detailed studies of density variations , evla observations can and should be employed .",
    "the single largest uncertainty is related to the mean properties of the gmc .",
    "while we have accounted for these uncertainties by adopting a very conservative range of values for the mean density ( covering two orders of magnitude ) , it is not entirely clear how the mean density of the cloud should be computed for comparison to simulations and the analytic distributions .",
    "since this is a foreground cloud lying in front of a rich portion of the galactic plane , the best mass estimates will always come from molecular line observations , and therefore they are unlikely to be improved unless new wide - field co observations are taken , e.g. with ccat .    to validate our cloud mean density measurements , we have performed a dendrogram analysis @xcite on the integrated @xmath1map of the grsmc 43.30 - 0.33cloud .",
    "we perform the analysis both on the large - scale @xmath121 pc cloud , tracking down to 10 pc scales , and then on the individual clump that is directly in front of w49 .",
    "we show the cloud density , computed using the assumptions stated in the text to convert @xmath1luminosity to mass , for three different geometrical assumptions described in the caption of figure [ fig : dendro ] . while the clump densities are potentially higher than we assumed in the analysis , they are probably not the appropriate numbers to compare to the simulations we have cited , which are generally simulating entire molecular clouds and measuring the density distribution within a large box ."
