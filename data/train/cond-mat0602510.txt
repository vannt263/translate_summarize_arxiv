    "d.  m.  basko , i.  l.  aleiner , and b.  l.  altshuler _ + physics department , columbia university , new york , ny 10027 , usa      transport properties of conducting materials at low temperature @xmath0 are determined by an interplay between the interaction of the itinerant electrons with each other and the quenched disorder which creates a random potential acting on these electrons . in the absence of the electron - electron interaction",
    "the most dramatic phenomenon is anderson localization ( anderson , 1958 )  the dc electrical conductivity @xmath1 can be qualitatively different depending on whether one - particle wave functions of the electrons are localized or not . in the latter case",
    "@xmath2 has a finite zero - temperature limit , while in the former case @xmath2 vanishes when @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , anderson localization of electronic states leads to the metal to insulator transition at zero temperature .",
    "when discussing zero temperature conductivity  @xmath4 , we need to consider only electronic states close to the fermi level .",
    "the conductivity becomes finite at any finite temperature provided that extended states exist somewhere near the fermi level .",
    "it is commonly accepted now that localized and extended states in a random potential can not be mixed in the one - electron spectrum and thus this spectrum in a general case is a combination of bands of extended states and bands of localized states .",
    "a border between a localized and an extended band is called mobility edge . if the fermi level is located inside a localized band and inelastic scattering of the electrons",
    "is completely absent , the conductivity should follow arrhenius law @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance from the fermi level to the closest mobility edge .",
    "another common belief following from the scaling theory of anderson localization ( thouless , 1977 ; abrahams _ et al .",
    "_ , 1979 ) , is that in low dimensionality @xmath7 , namely at @xmath8 all states are localized in an arbitrarily small disorder , while for free electrons ( no periodic potential ) @xmath9 is finite at @xmath10 .",
    "this statement was proved rigorously both for one - channel ( gertsenshtein and vasilev , 1959 ; berezinskii , 1973 ) and multi - channel ( efetov and larkin , 1983 ; dorokhov , 1983 ) disordered wires . ]",
    "it means that without inelastic processes @xmath11 , while for @xmath12 one should expect the arrhenius law .",
    "note that for electrons in a crystal within a given conduction band the latter conclusion is not always correct ",
    "strong enough disorder can localize the whole band .    as soon as inelastic processes are included , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "in particular , electron - phonon interaction leads to the mechanism of conductivity known as hopping conductivity ( fritzche , 1955 ; mott , 1968a ; shklovskii and efros , 1984 )  with an assistance of phonons , electrons hop between the localized states without being activated above the mobility edge . as a result",
    ", @xmath13 turns out to be finite ( although small ) at arbitrarily low  @xmath0 even when all one - electron states are localized .    can interaction between electrons play the same role and cause the hopping conductivity ?",
    "this question was discussed in literature for a long time ( fleishman and anderson , 1980 ; shahbazyan and raikh , 1996 ; kozub , baranovskii , and shlimak , 2000 ; nattermann , giamarchi , and le doussal , 2003 ; gornyi , mirlin , and polyakov , 2004 ) and no definite conclusion was achieved .",
    "the problem is that although the electric noise exists inside the material with a finite ac conductivity the `` photons '' in contrast with phonons become localized together with electrons .    in a recent work ( basko , aleiner , and altshuler , 2006 ) we have demonstrated that electron - electron interaction alone can not cause finite conductivity even when temperature is finite , but small enough . in the absence of phonons and extended one - electron states conductivity of a system of interacting electrons vanishes exactly below some critical temperature @xmath14 . at the same time , at high temperatures @xmath15 the conductivity @xmath2 is finite .",
    "it means that at @xmath16 the system of interacting electrons subject to a random potential undergoes a genuine phase transition that manifests itself by the emerging of a finite conductivity !",
    "this transition can be thought of as many - body localization  it applies to many - body eigenstates of the whole system .",
    "this localization occurs not in the real space , but rather in the fock space .",
    "this fact does not affect the validity of the concept of mobility edge .",
    "in fact , the existence of the `` metallic '' state at @xmath17 implies that the many - body states with energies @xmath18 above @xmath19 are extended .",
    "one can estimate the difference between @xmath19 and the energy of the many - body ground state @xmath20 as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of one - particle states in the energy strip of the width @xmath0 .",
    "note that the existence of the extended many - body states above the mobility edge does not contradict the fact that below @xmath14 there is no conductivity  in contrast with the case of one - particle localization there is no arrhenius regime since @xmath23 turns out to be proportional to the volume of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , is macroscopically large ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mbloc ] below for more details ) .    in order to avoid possible misunderstanding we would like to emphasize that we focus only on the inelastic collisions between the electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ , on creation or annihilation of _ real _ electron - hole pairs .",
    "there are other effects of electron - electron interactions which can be understood as renormalization of the one - particle random potential by the interaction .",
    "being temperature - dependent , this renormalization leads to a number of interesting effects , such as the interaction corrections to the density of states and conductivity in disordered metals ( altshuler and aronov , 1985 ) . on the insulating side of the one - particle localization transition similar effects",
    "cause the well - known coulomb gap ( shklovskii and efros , 1984 ) which reduces hopping conductivity . on the other hand , this is just a correction to the time - independent random potential . as such , it can maybe shift the position of the many - body metal to insulator transition , _",
    "i.e. _ , renormalize @xmath14 , but is unable to destabilize the insulating or metallic phases . from now on we will simply neglect all elastic ( hartree - fock ) effects and concentrate on the _ real _ inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "localization of the many - body states in the fock space has been discussed by altshuler _",
    "( 1997 ) for the case of zero - dimensional systems with finite , although large , number of electrons . in this paper",
    "the authors proposed an approximate mapping of the hamiltonian of a metallic grain with large thouless conductance @xmath24 and moderate interaction between the electrons to the one - particle hamiltonian on a lattice with the topology of the cayley tree and an on - site disorder .",
    "the latter problem has an exact solution ( abou - chacra , anderson , and thouless , 1973 ; efetov , 1987 ) that exhibits the localization transition . in terms of interaction electrons",
    "this transition means that one - particle excitation states below certain energy are quite close to some exact many - body excitations . as to the one - particle excitations with energies higher than the critical one",
    ", its wave function can be viewed as a linear combination of a large number of the many - body eigenstates .    for an infinite system ( @xmath25 )",
    "the situation is more complex , and cayley tree approximation is hard to justify .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent analysis of a model with weak and short range interaction to all orders of perturbation theory enabled us to analyze the many - body localization transition and to demonstrate that both the metallic state at high temperatures and the insulating state at low temperatures are stable and survive all higher loop corrections to the locator expansion .",
    "therefore , the existence of the transition is proved on the physical level of rigor .",
    "it should be noted that such an insulating state that is characterized by exactly zero conductivity is quite different from all other known types of insulators .",
    "for example , mott insulator is believed to have finite , though exponentially small conductivity at finite temperatures .",
    "the present text represents a shortened version of the paper by basko , aleiner , and altshuler ( 2006 ) , hereafter referred to as baa  paper .",

    "let us briefly review the basic concepts developed for the problem of one - electron wave functions in a disordered potential in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "depending on the strength of the disorder potential , a wave function @xmath26 of an eigenstate  @xmath27 with the energy  @xmath28 can be either _ localized _ or _ extended _ :",
    "@xmath29 here @xmath30 is the localization length which depends on the eigenenergy @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is the volume of the system .",
    "each localized state is characterized by a point in space , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 reaches its maximum , and an exponentially falling envelope . extended states spread more or less uniformly over the whole volume of the system .",
    "localized and extended states can not coexist at the same energy , and the spectrum splits into bands of localized and extended states .",
    "the energies separating such bands are known as _",
    "mobility edges_. for free electrons in @xmath34 disorder potential leads to only one mobility edge @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 if a finite mobility edge  ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) exists and the fermi level  @xmath37 lies in the band of localized states , the conductivity is determined by the exponentially small occupation number of the delocalized states @xmath38    in this paper we are interested in transport properties of the systems where _ all _ single - particle states are localized , and thus without many - body effects @xmath39 at any temperature .",
    "it is well established now that the mobility edge usually does not exist for one- and two - dimensional systems , and all single - particle states are indeed localized for an arbitrarily weak disorder .",
    "such a situation can arise for a large  @xmath7 as well , if the bandwidth is finite and disorder is sufficiently strong .",
    "as long as all single - particle states are localized , transport occurs only because of inelastic processes , which transfer electrons between different localized eigenstates . at this stage",
    "we introduce the main energy scale of the problem : the typical energy spacing between states whose spatial separation does not exceed  @xmath30 , so that there is overlap between their wave functions : @xmath40 where @xmath41  is the one - particle density of states per unit volume .",
    "the conductivity is , roughly speaking , proportional to the rate of the transitions between different localized states , which can be called inelastic relaxation rate  @xmath42 . obviously , at @xmath43 inelastic processes disappear , so regardless of the mechanism of inelastic relaxation the conductivity must vanish : @xmath44 the question is how @xmath13 approaches zero for each particular mechanism .",
    "when phonons are the main source of inelastic scattering , the answer is given by mott s variable range hopping formula ( mott , 1968a ) @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46  and  @xmath27 are constants .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ mottvrh= ] ) , @xmath13 remains finite as long as @xmath47 .",
    "the reason for @xmath48 is that for any pair of localized states one can always find a phonon whose frequency exactly corresponds to their energy mismatch , at low temperature one should just wait long enough .",
    "the same type of @xmath13-dependence would result from the coupling of electrons with _ any _ delocalized thermal bath whose energy spectrum is continuous down to zero energy .",
    "the specific nature of the bath at most affects the power - law prefactor . on the contrary ,",
    "the stretched exponential factor is universal ; it originates from the counting of electronic states available for the transition , and does not depend on the specific scattering mechanism .",
    "now let us assume that there is no external bath coupled to electrons , but some electron - electron interaction is present",
    ". what will be the dependence of  @xmath13 ?",
    "in line with the discussion of the previous subsection , the question should be posed as follows : do electron - hole pairs themselves provide a suitable bath in a localized system , thus validating eq .",
    "( [ mottvrh= ] ) ?",
    "one possible answer is `` yes '' .",
    "indeed , recall mott formula for the low - temperature dissipative ac conductivity @xmath49 in a localized system ( mott , 1968b ) : @xmath50 according to fluctuation - dissipation theorem , at finite temperature electromagnetic fluctuations of a finite spectral density should be present , and they might serve as a bath .",
    "the problem with this argument is that eq .",
    "( [ mottac= ] ) is the _ spatial average _ of the conductivity over the whole ( infinite ) volume . for each given realization of disorder , excitations determining @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ mottac= ] ) are localized , and although the total volume is infinite , the spectrum of electron - hole pairs is effectively discrete .",
    "the crucial point is that as long as electron - electron interaction is local in space ( here we do not consider long - range interactions ) , it effectively couples electronic states only within the same localization volume , where the spectrum of electronic states is effectively discrete .",
    "the following sections are dedicated to a systematic discussion of this problem which was first pointed out by fleishman and anderson ( 1980 ) .",
    "the conclusion can be stated as follows : electron - hole excitations can cause finite conductivity only if the temperature of the system exceeds some critical value . at lower temperatures @xmath13 vanishes exactly .",
    "[ [ sec : model ] ] matrix elements of electron - electron interaction between localized states : essential features of the model ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    for simplicity we consider a system of spinless electrons and assume that electron - electron interaction is weak and short - range : in the strict sense is equivalent to no interaction for spinless electrons , considered here , due to the pauli principle . here , by writing @xmath51",
    "we only mean that the range is much smaller than the electron mean free path , so it is not a true @xmath52-function .",
    "] @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimensionless interaction constant , @xmath41  is the one - particle density of states per unit volume .    in the basis of localized single - particle eigenstates the hamiltonian corresponding to the pair interaction potential  ( [ vr1r2= ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath55 consider the structure of the matrix elements @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 is short - range , they decrease exponentially when the spatial separation between the states increases , the characteristic scale being the localization length @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to this spatial suppression , the matrix elements decrease rapidly when the energy difference , say @xmath58 , increases exceeding the level spacing @xmath59 .",
    "this occurs because the localized wave functions oscillate randomly , and the bigger the energy difference , the weaker are these random oscillations correlated ( altshuler and aronov , 1985 ) .",
    "provided that the restrictions @xmath60 are fulfilled , we have @xmath61 .",
    "there are several ways to model these essential properties of @xmath56 . in baa  paper",
    "a specific model was adopted ; essentially , the space and energy dependences of the matrix elements were replaced by simple rectangular cutoffs ( see sec .  3 of baa  paper for details ) .",
    "conventionally , an elementary inelastic process is a decay of one single - particle excitation ( an electron occupying a state  @xmath27 ) into three single - particle excitations  a hole in the state  @xmath62 and two electrons in the states @xmath63  and  @xmath52 .",
    "such a decay can be described differently : one can say that the hamiltonian couples the single - particle excitation with the three - particle excitation by the matrix element @xmath56 . further action of the interaction hamiltonian produces five - particle excitations , seven - particle excitations , _ etc . _ : @xmath64 if on each stage the coupling is strong enough ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , the matrix element is of the same order or larger than the corresponding energy mismatch ) , the single - particle excitation indeed decays irreversibly into all possible many - body states . in other words ,",
    "exact many - body eigenstates become delocalized in the fock space . if , oppositely , three - particle states contribute only a weak perturbative admixture to the one - particle state , the contribution from five - particle states is even weaker , _ etc .",
    "_ , the initial electron will never decay completely .",
    "one can say that it is localized in the fock space .",
    "another way to visualize the inelastic relaxation is to look at the energy structure of the quasiparticle spectral function : @xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath67 are many - body eigenstates ( @xmath66 is not necessarily a ground state ) , @xmath68  and  @xmath69 are the corresponding energies .",
    "basically , @xmath70 shows how the single - particle excitation on top of a given eigenstate is spread over other many - body eigenstates of the system .      one can represent the spectral function in the form of expansion in powers of the interaction constant  @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] ) : @xmath72 @xmath73 corresponds to the bare quasiparticle peak , @xmath74 .",
    "linear in  @xmath71 term represents a random hartree - fock shift of the energy  @xmath28 which is already assumed to be random .",
    "this linear term is of no interest to us , so it is not included in the expansion  ( [ spectralperturbative= ] ) .",
    "the @xmath75 term corresponds to the contribution of three - particle excitations .",
    "the number of these excitations is effectively finite due to the restrictions  ( [ spatialcutoff= ] ) ,  ( [ energycutoff= ] ) , so @xmath76 is a collection of @xmath52-peaks at three - particle energies @xmath77 .",
    "again , @xmath78  terms correspond only to peak shifts and are omitted .",
    "the five - particle contribution @xmath79 is again a collection of @xmath52-peaks , however , spaced more closely than three - particle peaks .",
    "this represents the general rule : the more particles are involved , the higher is the density of the peaks . at the same time",
    ", contributions of many - particle processes are suppressed due to the smallness of  @xmath71 .",
    "what is crucial to us , is the result of this competition at @xmath80 : will the empty spaces between peaks be filled making @xmath70 a continuous function , or the process will be suppressed by the powers of  @xmath71 and @xmath70 will remain a collection of @xmath52-peaks ?",
    "thus , the problem of inelastic relaxation of a quasiparticle due to electron - electron interaction is related to the problem of localization or delocalization of excitations in the many - electron fock space .",
    "the simplest model describing localization - delocalization physics is anderson model .",
    "anderson ( 1958 ) considered a tight - binding model on a @xmath7-dimensional lattice .",
    "the coupling between sites is nearest - neighbor only with a fixed matrix element  @xmath81 .",
    "the on - site energies are assumed to be random and uncorrelated , with some typical value denoted by  @xmath82 .",
    "it is thus tempting to identify the many - electron hamiltonian  ( [ hloc= ] ) with the anderson hamiltonian on a certain lattice , whose sites correspond to many - particle excitations  @xcite . the approximate rules of correspondence then should be the following :    * @xmath83  typical value of the coupling matrix element ; * @xmath84  typical energy mismatch in each consecutive virtual transition , @xmath85 ; * finally , the coordination number @xmath86 .",
    "this represents the number of three - particle excitations to which a given single - particle excitation is coupled , with the energy mismatch not exceeding  @xmath59 . the value @xmath87 is obtained as the product of the number of electrons  @xmath62 within the same localization volume , available for the collision with the probe electron  @xmath27 ( @xmath88 ) , and the number of ways to distribute energy allowed by the restriction  ( [ energycutoff= ] ) , which is @xmath89 .    according to anderson ( 1958 ) ,",
    "localization - delocalization transition occurs at @xmath90 for the interacting localized electrons this would imply that below some temperature  @xmath14 the inelastic relaxation is frozen , so that the conductivity vanishes exactly ; above  @xmath14 some inelastic relaxation is taking place , and the conductivity is finite .",
    "this corresponds to a finite - temperature metal - insulator transition .",
    "this analogy , however , should be used with caution .",
    "anderson s result , in fact , can be sensitive to the structure of the lattice ; possible sources of problems are listed in sec .",
    "2.2 of baa  paper .",
    "one can develop a systematic approach to the problem , based on the diagrammatic technique for interacting electrons ( basko , aleiner , and altshuler , 2006 ) .",
    "below we headline the basic ideas of this approach to justify the assumption that eq .",
    "( [ anderson= ] ) indeed correctly determines the point of the metal - insulator transition .        as discussed in previous sections ,",
    "the focus of the problem is the inelastic quasiparticle relaxation , which is represented by the imaginary part of the single - particle self - energy : @xmath91 we stress that @xmath92 is a random quantity , as it depends on the positions of all single - particle levels @xmath93 and all occupation numbers @xmath94 .",
    "one has no other choice but to perform statistical analysis of this random quantity .    how to distinguish between metallic and insulating phases within a statistical framework ?",
    "it is clear that positions of the peaks in @xmath95 for the insulating regime wander randomly with the variation of random energies @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ hloc= ] ) . due to this variation ,",
    "the ensemble average of the decay rate @xmath96 is the same in both phases and can not be used for the distinction .",
    "in fact , one has to investigate the whole distribution function @xmath97 .     in the metallic ( dashed line ) and insulating ( solid line ) phases for a given realization of single - particle levels @xmath98 .",
    "( b )  the corresponding distribution functions @xmath97 for @xmath95 at a given energy  @xmath99 in the metallic ( dashed line ) and insulating ( solid line ) phases . ]    to understand the difference in the behavior of @xmath97 in the two phases , it is instructive to start with the behavior of @xmath92 for a given realization of disorder , fig .",
    "deep in the metallic phase @xmath92 is a smooth function of energy , so its distribution @xmath97 at a given energy is a narrow gaussian . in the insulating phase @xmath92",
    "is given by a sequence of infinitely narrow @xmath52-peaks , so an arbitrarily chosen value of  @xmath99 falls between the peaks with the probability  1 , giving @xmath100 . if @xmath99 hits a @xmath52-peak , then @xmath101 , which happens , however , with zero probability .",
    "one can deal with this uncertainty by introducing an infinitesimal imaginary energy shift ( damping )  @xmath102 , and consider @xmath103 .",
    "physically , it may be viewed as an infinitesimally weak coupling to a dissipative bath ( e.  g. , phonons ) . clearly , in the metallic phase it has no effect , while in the insulating phase this damping broadens @xmath52-peaks into lorentzians of the width  @xmath102 , which leads to appearance of the tails .",
    "now , even if the energy  @xmath99 falls between the peaks , @xmath42  will have a finite value proportional to  @xmath102 . as a result",
    ", the distribution function @xmath97 will have the form sketched in fig .",
    "now , having calculated the distribution function for a small but finite  @xmath102 , one can distinguish between the metallic and the insulating phases according to @xmath104 here @xmath31 is the total volume of the system .",
    "we emphasize that the order of limits in eq .",
    "( [ criterion ] ) can not be interchanged , since in a finite closed system the spectrum always consists of discrete @xmath52-peaks .",
    "our main object of interest is the probability distribution function of the decay rate @xmath97 .",

    "the basis in the fock space is formed by slater determinants corresponding to @xmath106 only , and @xmath42  represents the rate of a transition between two such basis states with different sets of @xmath108 .",
    "temperature enters through total energy of the state , which is determined by all  @xmath108 and is proportional to the volume of the system ( this issue will be discussed in more detail in sec .  [",
    "sec : mbloc ] of the present paper ) .",
    "iterations of scba generate self - energy diagrams which have one common property : they describe decay processes where the number of particles in the final state is maximized for each given order in  @xmath71 , thus maximizing the phase space available for the decay .",

    "one would have to introduce the full @xmath111-particle vertex analogously to how it is done in conventional fermi liquid theory for @xmath113 ( landau , 1958 ; eliashberg , 1962 ) . in this case",
    "the result for the transition temperature will be determined not by the bare interaction constant , but by the statistics of the full vertex functions .",
    "existence and regularity of these vertex functions are basically equivalent to the assumption that in the absence of disorder the interacting system is a fermi liquid .",
    "starting from the self - consistent equations ( [ scbarate= ] ) ,  ( [ scbaspectral= ] ) , one can straightforwardly verify ( see sec .",
    "5.1 of baa  paper ) that @xmath97 can be well approximated by gaussian distribution with the average and dispersion @xmath114 provided that @xmath115 according to the arguments of sec .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] , this is characteristic of the metallic phase .",

    "the answer to this question turns out to be determined by the anderson localization - delocalization physics in the many - particle fock space , and is summarized on fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the many - body localization , which we discuss in this paper , is qualitatively different from conventional finite temperature metal to insulator transitions , such as formation of a band insulator due to the structural phase transition or mott - hubbard transition . in these two cases , at a certain temperature @xmath177 a gap appears in the spectrum of charge excitation ( mott insulator ) or all excitations ( band insulator ) . in both cases",

    "is the many - body localization a true thermodynamical phase transition with corresponding singularities in all equilibrium properties ?",
    "this question definitely requires additional studies , however , some speculations can be put forward .",
    "the physics described in the present paper is associated with the change of the characteristics of the many - body wavefunctions .",
    "it is well known that for non - interacting systems localization - delocalization transition does not affect the average density of states , _",
    "i.e. _ , it does not manifest itself in any macroscopic thermodynamic properties .",
    "application of the same logic to the exact many - body eigenvalues would indicate that the many - body localization transition is not followed by any singularities in the static specific heat , etc . on the other hand , at this point we can not rule out the possibility that this conclusion is an artifact of treating the real parts of the electron self - energies with an insufficient accuracy .",
    "most likely scenario , to our opinion , is that the insulating phase behaves like a glass ( spin or structural ) and demonstrates all the glassy properties ( fisher and hertz , 1991 ; bouchaud _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) , like absence of ergodicity ( even when some coupling with phonons is included ) , effects of aging , etc .",
    "discussion of the equilibrium susceptibilities in the latter case becomes quite meaningless .",
    "the quantitative theory built in baa  paper assumes that the interaction is weak . on the other hand , qualitative consideration of the localization of many - body excitations",
    "does not rely on this assumption .",
    "the important ingredients are ( i )  localization of single - particle excitations , and ( ii )  fermi statistics .",
    "consider , as an example , wigner crystal ( wigner , 1934 ) .",
    "it is well known that strong enough interaction leads to a spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry in @xmath7-dimensional clean systems at @xmath179 . in a clean system",
    "wigner crystallization is either a first - order phase transition ( @xmath10 ) , or a kosterlitz - thouless transition ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "even weak disorder destroys both translational and orientational order ( larkin , 1970 ) and pins the crystal .",
    "the symmetry of this state is thus not different from the symmetry of a liquid , and the thermodynamic phase transition is commonly believed to be reduced to a crossover .",
    "we argue that the many - body localization provides the correct scenario for the finite - temperature `` melting '' transition between the insulating phase , which may be called `` solid '' , and the metallic phase , which may be called `` liquid '' .",
    "indeed , the conductivity of the pinned wigner crystal is provided by the motion of defects . at low temperatures and in the absence of the external bath , all defects are localized by the one - particle anderson mechanism .",
    "phonon modes of the wigner crystal are localized as well , so the system should behave as a many - body insulator . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the many - body metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "it is not clear at present , whether it occurs before or after the crystalline order is destroyed at distances smaller than larkin s scale .",
    "construction of effective theory of such a transition is a problem which deserves further investigation .",
