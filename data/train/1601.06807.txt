    "actually even more is true : any real polynomial can be approximated by hyperbolic real polynomials of the same degree ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .    from the _ topological _ viewpoint ,",
    "therefore , _ most _ one - dimensional dynamical systems are uniformly hyperbolic . by considering families parametrized by _ finite dimensional _ manifolds , one can ask about most dynamical systems from a _ probabilistic _ viewpoint , with respect to lebesgue measure on parameter space ( see also the recent _ global _ probabilistic approach for circle diffeomorphisms considered in @xcite ) . with this purpose",
    ", we say that an interval map is _ stochastic _ if it admits an invariant borel probability measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that if @xmath1 has critical points , is @xmath15 and axiom a , then its corresponding set @xmath6 has zero lebesgue measure ( ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the support of any invariant borel probability measure has zero lebesgue measure and in particular no invariant measure of an axiom a map with critical points can be absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue .",
    "let us illustrate this discussion with a classical example : for each @xmath16 consider the quadratic polynomial @xmath17\\to[0,1]$ ] given by @xmath18 .",
    "this one - parameter family , the so - called _ quadratic family _ , was introduced by r. may in 1976 @xcite as a model for the growth , or fluctuation , of biological populations .",
    "as explained above , there exists an open and dense set of parameters @xmath16 such that the corresponding polynomials @xmath19 are axiom a. for those maps , lebesgue almost every point converges to a unique attracting periodic orbit ( this includes the critical point ) .",
    "however , in the early eighties , jakobson @xcite proved the existence of a _ positive _ measure set of parameters @xmath16 such that the corresponding maps are stochastic .",
    "therefore , at least from the probabilistic viewpoint , stochastic dynamics are not negligible .",
    "later , lyubich proved that @xmath19 is either axiom a or stochastic for a _ full _ lebesgue measure set of parameters @xmath16 @xcite . under suitable conditions ,",
    "the same dichotomy holds for _ generic _ one - parameter families of real analytic unimodal maps @xcite .",
    "after jakobson result , _ metric _ conditions were shown to be sufficient for a smooth interval map to be stochastic ( many papers have addressed this problem , see",

    "those conditions are usually related to the growth of the derivative along the critical orbit . in this paper",
    "we look for more _ combinatorial _ conditions , instead of metric ones ( see theorem [ thma ] and theorem [ thmb ] below ) . with our approach we are able to give not only sufficient but also necessary conditions ( see conditions [ c- ] and [ c+ ] in section [ statements ] below ) for a bimodal degree one circle endomorphism , such that all its periodic orbits are repelling and with irrational combinatorics of both critical points , to be stochastic ( theorem [ thma ] )",

    "however , wiatek has proved in  @xcite that in the arnold - like families the corresponding parameters @xmath63 have zero lebesgue measure in @xmath95 .    in some way",

    "gets also an invariant probability measure which is equivalent to the lebesgue measure .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the first results that showed existence of absolutely continuous invariant measure for smooth one - dimensional maps with some recurrent critical point is certainly jakobson s theorem in  @xcite . in any proof one needs to avoid strong recurrence of the critical orbits near the critical points .",
