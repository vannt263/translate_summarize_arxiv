    "longitudinal data include repeated observations across time which belong to the same subjects / units and which are typically dependent on each other . often , multiple longitudinal responses , such as multiple health outcomes or distress variables , are of interest .",
    "these types of responses involve two types of dependencies : 1 ) within - response ( serial ) dependence , and 2 ) multivariate response dependence at a given time point .",
    "both of these should be taken into account to draw valid statistical inferences , although they might not be of primary interest .",
    "traditional longitudinal data models can be threefold : marginal , transition and random effects models ( diggle et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "each of these has their pros and cons , and the decision regarding which model to use depends on the scientific interest , i.e. , none of them is the best ( gardiner et al . , 2009 ) . recently , marginally specified models ( or simply marginalized models ) have become popular for discrete longitudinal data analysis which combine the underlying properties of the aforementioned traditional models .",
    "heagerty and zeger ( 2000 ) defined such a model as a re - parameterized version of a model ( transition and/or random effects models here ) in terms of the marginal mean and additional dependence parameters .",
    "the seminal works of heagerty ( 1999 , 2002 ) considered likelihood based models by marginalizing the random effects and transition models , respectively .",
    "they were two - level logistic regression models that incorporated the marginal covariate effects in the first level , and captured serial dependence in the second level via random effects and transition parameters , respectively .",
    "hence , they permitted multiple inferences at the same time and likelihood based inference for marginal mean parameters .",
    "moreover , in these models marginal regression parameters were shown to be less sensitive to misspecification of dependence structure compared to their traditional counterparts , such as random effects models ( heagerty and kurland , 2001 ) .",
    "the marginalized modeling paradigm were primarily developed for binary longitudinal data ( schildcrout and heagerty , 2007 ; ilk and daniels , 2007 ; lee et al .",
    ", 2009 ; along with the aforementioned works of heagerty ) , and it has been extended later to ordinal ( caffo and griswold , 2006 ; lee and daniels , 2007 ; lee et al . ,",
    "2013 ) , count ( lee et al . , 2011 ; iddi and molenberghs , 2012 ) and nominal longitudinal data ( lee and mercante , 2010 ) .",
    "among these works , ilk and daniels ( 2007 ) proposed a three - level marginalized model ( marginalized transition random effects models , mtrem ) for multivariate longitudinal binary data .",
    "while the marginal covariate effects were accommodated in the first level , serial and multivariate response dependencies were captured in the second and third levels via transition parameter and random effects , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we propose a marginally specified model for multivariate longitudinal binary data by extending mtrem in terms of link functions , i.e. , from _ logit _ to _ probit _ , and parameter estimation methodology , i.e. , from _ bayesian methods _",
    "( bm ) to _ maximum likelihood estimation _",
    "( mle ) .",
    "_ probit _ and _ logit _ are two widely used link functions in regression analysis of categorical data .",
    "while the former is defined as the inverse of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of standard normal distribution , the latter is defined as the inverse of the cdf of standard logistic distribution .",
    "they reflect similar behavior of placing probabilities and are almost indistinguishable except for very low and very high probabilities ; _ logit _ lets higher probability in the tails ( hedeker and gibbons , 2006 ) .",
    "often , large amounts of high quality data are needed to detect substantial differences between the conclusions drawn from the regression models with those link functions ( doksum and gakso , 1990 , cited in hedeker and gibbons , 2006 , pp .",
    "while _ logit _",
    "yields direct interpretation of the regression coefficients , e.g. , change in the natural logarithm of the odds ratios , this is more challenging with _",
    "probit_. however , approximate transitions between _ logit _ and _ probit _ regression parameter estimates are possible ( agresti , 2002 ; griswold , 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , johnson et al . ( 1995 , pp .",
    "113 - 163 , cited in griswold , 2005 , pp.85 - 96 ) proposed a constant ( jkb constant ) between these estimates : @xmath0 where @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "_ probit _ link usually provides explicit linkage between the levels of marginalized models ( griswold , 2005 ) .",
    "however , this is not possible with _ logit _ link .",
    "caffo and griswold ( 2006 ) also discussed the computational advantages of _ probit _ link when it was accompanied with normally distributed components .",
    "multivariate probit modeling literature dates back to the seminal work by ashford and sowden ( 1970 ) .",
    "some recent examples utilizing _ probit _ link in the concept of longitudinal data mixed modeling could be found in hedeker and gibbons ( 2006 ) , liu and hedeker ( 2006 ) , varin and czado ( 2010 ) , hutmacher and french ( 2011 ) among others .",
    "semi - parametric methods , namely generalized estimating equations ( gee ; liang and zeger , 1986 ) , have been widely used for marginal models , especially for discrete response .",
    "nonetheless , they are often inefficient compared to the full likelihood based methods such as mle and bm . moreover",
    ", a key condition for the consistency of estimates obtained by gee often fails for transition models ( pepe and anderson , 1994 ) .",
    "bm are also common in longitudinal data literature and have their own properties .",
    "some distinguishing differences are that mle requires less computational times , and related procedures are more automatized compared to bm ( efron , 1986 ) . in this paper , we consider mle to avoid the computational burden and possible inconsistencies in a complicated three - level model , for which one of these levels is a transition model",
    ".    marginally specified models with transition structures introduce marginal constraint equations ( heagerty , 2002 ; schildcrout and heagerty , 2007 ; ilk and daniels , 2007 ; lee and mercante , 2010 ) .",
    "common literature solve these constraints via optimization methods such as newton - raphson ( n - r ) algorithm , which are computationally cumbersome and might yield convergence problems . in this paper , we consider approximately explicit solutions of such constraint equations and propose the use of the _ implicit function theorem _ for the first time in the scope of marginally specified models .",
    "there is a lack of available software for analyzing multivariate longitudinal binary data .",
    "limited literature include the works of shelton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , asar ( 2012 ) and asar and ilk ( 2013 ) . among these , while the former proposed a sas macro for multivariate longitudinal binary data , the latter proposed two r ( r core development team , 2013 ) packages for multivariate longitudinal data . in this study",
    ", we propose an r package * pnmtrem * for marginalized modeling of multivariate longitudinal binary data .",
    "the package is available from the comprehensive r archive network ( cran ) at http://cran.r-project.org/package=pnmtrem .",
    "empirical bayesian estimates of random effects coefficients are also derived , and implementation is included in this package .",
    "these estimates allow making subject specific inferences and detecting interesting subjects in the study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the proposed model and discuss its features . in section 3 , we consider the related parameter estimation procedure .",
    "while section 4 considers a simulation study on the proposed model , section 5 illustrates its application on a real life data set and discusses the parameter interpretation .",
    "we end the paper with the discussion and conclusion part provided in section 6 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the @xmath3th ( @xmath4 ) response for the @xmath5th ( @xmath6 ) subject at time @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 be the associated set of covariates .",
    "@xmath9 might include time - variant and/or time - invariant covariates .",
    "also let @xmath10 be the cdf of the standard normal distribution .",
    "use of inverse _ probit _ link yields the following representation of the model :    @xmath11    in the first level of the model , @xmath12 are the marginal regression coefficients that directly account for the covariate effects on the mean responses , i.e. , the covariate effects are not conditioned on either the response history or the random effects .",
    "they allow comparing sub - groups of covariates such as females vs. males . although it is assumed that the intercept and the slopes ( covariate effects ) are shared by different responses ( same @xmath12 for different responses ) , the inclusion of response indicator variables as covariates allow different responses to have their own intercepts .",
    "similarly , the inclusion of the interactions of response indicator variables and covariates allow different responses have different slopes .",
    "this construction provides model flexibility : it allows one to fit a more parsimonious model when the covariate effects on multiple responses do not differ , which might yield parameter estimates with lower variances .",
    "typical setup of the model assumes that only the covariates at time @xmath7 have significant effects on the responses at that time point , i.e. , @xmath13 = @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , lagged covariates might be included in the model via the design matrix .    in the second level of the model ,",
    "the within - subject associations are captured by a markov model of order @xmath15 . here",
    "the _ m_th transition parameters , @xmath16 , can be expressed in terms of covariates .",
    "specifically , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the time / covariate / order specific transition parameter which accommodates the effect of the past response on the current one by taking into account the interaction between the past response and a subset of covariates as well ; @xmath15 is the order of the transition model and @xmath21 are typically a subset of covariates with _",
    "l _ independent variables . note that @xmath21 have the form of a design matrix , i.e. , include 1 s on the first column .",
    "choices of @xmath21 permit various association structures between the current and past responses .",
    "for example , if the effects of the lag-1 responses on the current ones are expected to be different for males and females , then gender could be included in @xmath22 .",
    "similar to the first level , although the transition parameters , @xmath23 are shared across multiple responses ( common parameters for different responses ) , the inclusion of interaction(s ) between the response indicator variables and the response history allow(s ) these parameters to differ for multiple responses .    in the third level of the model",
    ", the multivariate response dependence and individual variations are accounted by a random effects model .",
    "it is possible to observe variations in responses of two subjects even if they have exactly the same observed covariates and past responses . in such cases ,",
    "marginal and transition models are inadequate in capturing this subject specific differences .",
    "the @xmath24 in measures this unobserved heterogeneity between the subjects at time @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath25 is response specific parameter that scales the random effects with respect to response @xmath3 and accommodates the multivariate response dependence .",
    "an approximate correlation among different responses , as a function of @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 , can be found in ilk and daniels ( 2007 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 is subject / time specific random effects coefficient and it is assumed that @xmath24 @xmath28 n(0 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xmath24 can be rewritten as @xmath24=@xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath30 is a standard normal random variable ; this version of @xmath24 is useful in numerical integration which will be introduced later . for identifiability ,",
    "@xmath31 is set to 1 .",
    "note that by allowing the random effects to change over time , i.e. , by having index @xmath7 in @xmath24 , the model accommodates different multivariate response dependencies at different time points .",
    "@xmath32 in is subject / time / response specific intercept that takes the non - linear relationship between the marginal and transition probabilities into account ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath26 in is the subject / time / response specific intercept that captures the non - linear relationship between the transition and random effects probabilities ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) .",
    "this three - level model specification of pnmtrem completes the multivariate distribution of the multivariate longitudinal binary data .",
    "one of the inherited features of pnmtrem from the original setup of mtrem is that the conditional mean of the responses given all set of covariates is equal to the conditional mean of the responses given the covariate history , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "this assumption is vital for the validity of the marginal constraint equation which will be introduced later while linking the levels of the model .",

    "we will discuss these aspects later .",
    "we assume two different models for a given multivariate longitudinal binary data set in the pnmtrem framework : baseline and @xmath39 models .",
    "the related likelihood function of pnmtrem(1 ) is the product of two likelihood functions belonging to these models . rewriting the random effects @xmath43 and @xmath24 as @xmath85 and @xmath86 yields this likelihood to be    @xmath87    where @xmath88 @xmath89    here , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , are parameter vectors for baseline and @xmath39 models , respectively ; @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the observed response matrices at baseline and @xmath39 time points , respectively .",
    "although these two likelihoods seem to be independent , they are connected to each other via the estimates of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath98 , for @xmath51 due to the marginal constraint equation ( see ) .",
    "we consider the estimation of @xmath99 for @xmath100 , instead of directly estimating @xmath29 or @xmath101 , due to computational aspects , since taking logarithm of the variance components extends the related parameter space from the interval of @xmath102 to @xmath103 . turning back to the estimates of @xmath29 or @xmath101 is possible by the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimates ( mle ) , and the related variance estimates could be obtained by the delta method .    maximizing the likelihood function given in needs numerical methods while taking one - dimensional integrals over the standard normal distribution .",
    "it is well known that for approximating one - dimensional integrals , e.g. , for constant random effects over time or independent random effects over time , gauss - hermite quadrature is a successful method ( agresti , 2002 ; mcculloch et al . , 2008 ) .",

    "note that ilk and daniels ( 2007 ) considered bm , specifically markov chain monte carlo methods , for mtrem as the parameter estimation methodology , which did not require taking integrals over the random effects distribution in likelihoods .",
    "however , this method yielded the parameter estimation process taking long time .",
    "first partial derivatives of the log - likelihood functions of pnmtrem do not permit obtaining explicit solutions to the mle of the parameters .",
    "therefore , optimization techniques are needed .",
    "n - r requires the calculation of first and second partial derivatives of the log - likelihood functions",

    "these variables were collected by a symptom check list , including nervousness , shakiness , an urge to break things and feeling low in energy etc , and dichotomized later according to whether having at least one of the distress symptoms ( ilk , 2008 ) .",
    "it was observed that young people were highly distressed .",
    "for instance , almost 93% of them reported at least one depression symptom at 1989 ( table [ tab : resp.perc ] ) .",
    "it was also observed that young people tended to report higher depression compared to anxiety and hostility .",
    "moreover the latter distress variables seemed to have close prevalences .",
    "a set of explanatory variables , which were thought to be related with these emotional variables , were also collected ( table [ tab : iyfpvar2 ] ) .",
    "these variables included gender , degree of negative life event experiences of the young people ( such as having a close friend moved away permanently ) , financial cutbacks ( such as moving to a cheaper residence ) and negative economical event experiences of their families ( such as changing job for a worse one ) .",
    "the main aim of collecting the family information was to measure the indirect effects of the farm crisis on the well - being of young people as well , e.g. , due to harsh parenting . among the explanatory variables , while gender was time - invariant , the others were time - varying .",
    "transition model in the second level of pnmtrem required the use of equally spaced time points .",
    "we considered the first 4-year follow - up of the iyfp study , i.e. , years 1989 to 1992 , in our analyses , since this was a fully constrained portion of the whole data set ( ilk , 2008 ) .",
    "response and time indicator variables were included as additional explanatory variables , and dummy variables were created for all the categorical covariates ( table [ tab : iyfpvar2 ] ) .",
    "we coded the binary explanatory variables as 0 vs. 1 in our initial data analyses .",
    "however , an alternative coding , i.e. , -1 vs. 1 , was used due to convergence problems during model fittings with the initial analyses .",
    "the data set is available upon request from the authors .",
    "pnmtrem(1 ) enables us to answer several questions on both the comparison of the sub - groups of young people and/or their families and on some specific young persons .",
    "moreover , it permits drawing different statistical inferences for @xmath164 and @xmath165 periods . for instance , we can compare the distress levels of males and females by the first levels of both baseline and @xmath39 models .",
    "the inclusion of the interaction between gender and response indicator variables in the design matrices permits response specific comparison of the gender , i.e. , comparison of anxiety , hostility and depression levels of males and females separately . we can measure the effect of the past year s distress status on the current ones by the second level of @xmath39 model .",
    "the inclusion of the interaction between lag-1 responses and response indicator variables allows us to have response specific inferences about the transition probabilities .",
    "for instance , we can measure the relationship between the anxiety status of young people at 1990 and the ones at 1991 .",
    "furthermore , we can draw subject - specific inferences by using the last levels of the models .",
    "for instance , we can calculate the probability of being anxious for subject @xmath166 at year @xmath167 .",
    "note that this probability is subject , time and response specific .",
    "we specifically built two different pnmtrem(1 ) s . while the marginal regression parameters of these models were same , they differed in terms of separating the effects of the distress status histories on the current distress status for multiple responses .",
    "put another way , the first model ( model 1 in table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.tgeq2 ] ) included only ones in the design matrix @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath160 $ ] . on the other hand , the second model ( model 2 in table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.tgeq2 ] ) included response indicator variables in the design matrix @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath168 $ ] . since the baseline models were same for model 1 and model 2 , we presented only one baseline result in table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.baseline ] . results for @xmath39 models",
    "are presented in table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.tgeq2 ] . in these tables ,",
    "results of the generalized linear models ( glm ) with _ probit _ link are presented as well .",
    "note that glm ignored the within and multivariate response dependencies and the related results were actually used to start the fisher - scoring ( f - s ) algorithms .    since model 1 and model 2",
    "are nested models , we can compare them by the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) .",
    "the corresponding maximized log - likelihoods were the summation of the ones for baseline and @xmath39 models : -1236.78 @xmath169 and -1234.49 @xmath170 for models 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the lrt statistic for the comparison of these models was 4.58 @xmath171 with a p - value of 0.60 which indicated that there was not enough evidence to conclude that model 2 explained the iyfp data better compared to model 1 with 95% confidence level @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , throughout we only considered model 1 while making interpretations about the parameter estimates .",
    "we checked the existence of possible multicollinearity problems via variance inflation factor ( vif ) .",
    "results ( not shown here ) showed that there was no such problem in our models ; the largest vif was 1.17 .",
    "here , we also point out that ilk and daniels ( 2007 ) confirmed the exogeneity of the time - varying covariates in the ifyp data set",
    ".    baseline results ( table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.baseline ] ) indicated that only the intercept , one of the negative life event indicators ( nle2 ) and one of the response indicators ( resp2 ) were significant at 95% confidence level in 1989 .",
    "the estimate of intercept ( @xmath173 ) indicated that young people had high probability of distress at 1989 .",
    "additionally , the estimate of the second response indicator variable ( @xmath174 ) indicated that young people were more likely to report depression compared to anxiety and hostility .",
    "moreover , the insignificance of the first response indicator variable ( p - value=0.99 ) indicated that there was not enough evidence towards differences in terms of reporting anxiety and hostility .",
    "these conclusions were indeed in agreement with our expectations , since the percentages of distress presences were fairly high for each response variables , and these percentages were higher for depression compared to anxiety and hostility ( table [ tab : resp.perc ] ) .",
    "moreover , it was found that young people who had many negative life events were more likely to be distressed ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "there was not enough evidence to say that the pairwise correlations between anxiety , hostility and depression were significantly different ; corresponding p - values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 were 0.91 and 0.96 .",
    "the standard deviation of the random effects distribution was estimated as 0.66 @xmath178 with a standard error of 0.27 ( @xmath179 , by the delta method ) .",
    "this parameter was found highly significant with a p - value of 0.007 . of note ,",
    "the calculation of this p - value was modified by following molenberghs and verbeke ( 2007 ) , since the related hypothesis test introduced the equality of the parameter at its lower boundary .",
    "although the marginal mean results of pnmtrem(1 ) and probit glm seemed to be in agreement , the significant difference between the maximized log - likelihoods of these models ( -210.78 and -511.98 , respectively ) indicated that fitting a marginalized random effects model explained the 1989 data better .",
    "for the later time points @xmath180 , intercept , gender , both negative life event indicators ( nle1 , nle2 ) , negative economical events experience ( nee ) , one of the cutbacks indicators ( cut1 ) , one of the response indicators ( resp2 ) , one of the time indicators ( time2 ) and the interaction between gender and second response indicator ( gender*resp2 ) were significant at 95% confidence level ( table [ tab : mtrem.iyfp.tgeq2 ] ) .",
    "similar to the baseline results , the estimate of the intercept indicated that young people had high probability of distress ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "however , the distress probabilities tended to be lower than baseline ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "females were more likely to be distressed compared to males ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "moreover , they were more likely to be depressed ( @xmath184 ) compared to them being anxious or hostile .",
    "note that gender was found insignificant at 1989 , and this result was supported by ge et al .",
    "( 2001 , cited in ilk , 2008 ) and ilk ( 2008 ) .",
    "young people who experienced many negative life events and whose families experienced any negative economical events were found more likely to be distressed ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) .",
    "young people were more likely to be depressed compared to being anxious or hostile ( @xmath188 ) . on the other hand , there was no significant difference between being anxious and hostile ( p - value of @xmath189 ) . while the distress levels were lower at 1992 compared to 1990 and 1991 ( @xmath190 )",
    ", there was no significant difference between 1990 and 1991 ( p - value of @xmath191 ) .",
    "however , the decrease in 1992 was not significantly different with respect to a specific response variable ; p - values for @xmath192 and @xmath193 were found to be 0.92 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "we can also interpret our _ probit _ marginal mean parameters as in the case of _ logit _ estimates , i.e. , in terms of odds - ratios by using the jkb constant .",
    "this offers an approximate relationship between the _ probit _ and _ logit _ estimates , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath194 .",
    "for instance , the influence of the degree of negative life events on the probability of being distressed can be interpreted as follows : young people who experienced many negative life events were approximately 2.26 @xmath195 times more likely to be distressed compared to those with some negative life events , and individuals in the latter group were 1.60 @xmath196 times more likely to be distressed compared to those with no negative life events .",
    "the positive ( and significant ) transition parameter estimates indicated that young people who were distressed at year @xmath197 were more likely to be distressed at year @xmath7 compared to the ones who were not distressed at year @xmath197 , i.e. , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 with p - values @xmath201 .",
    "moreover , these transition parameter estimates were shared across anxiety , hostility and depression . as for the baseline model ,",
    "there was not enough evidence to say that the pairwise correlations between anxiety , hostility and depression were significantly different ; corresponding p - values were 0.94 and 0.68 for hostility and depression , respectively .",
    "the estimates of the standard deviations of the random effects distributions were found to be 0.62 @xmath202 , 0.54 @xmath203 and 0.54 @xmath203 , respectively at 1990 , 1991 and 1992 . related",
    "standard errors were 0.16 , 0.14 and 0.14 , respectively , and all of these parameters were found to be highly significant with p - values @xmath204 0.0001 .",
    "these results indicated that the individual variations were decreasing across time ( recall that @xmath205=0.66 ) and close to each other at 1991 and 1992 .",
    "similar to the baseline results , @xmath39 results indicated that pnmtrem(1 ) yielded a great improvement compared to glm , which was apparent from the comparisons of the log - likelihoods , -1026 vs. -1989.23 .",
    "our pnmtrem(1 ) results for the iyfp data set mostly coincided with the ones reported by ilk ( 2008 ) .",
    "we observed that model 1 and model 2 produced equal or nearly same marginal regression parameter estimates , z statistics and p - values .",
    "this is natural due to the fact that marginalized models are less sensitive to the misspecification of the dependence structures ( heagerty and kurland , 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , heagerty ( 2002 ) and lee and mercante ( 2010 ) proved that the parameters of the first and second levels of marginalized transition models ( mtm ) were orthogonal . since the first and the second levels of pnmtrem are equivalent to mtm with _ probit _ links",
    ", we expect the same property to hold for pnmtrem as well .    up to here , we have drawn population - averaged inferences . besides",
    ", we can draw individual - level inferences by using pnmtrem(1 ) . to illustrate , we calculated the success probabilities regarding anxiety , hostility and depression of each person at each year by using the last levels of baseline and @xmath39 models .",
    "in addition to these random effects probabilities , we calculated marginal probabilities for comparison purposes .",
    "these probabilities are summarized in figure [ fig : depr.cond.vs.marg ] .",
    "due to page limits , we only included the figures for depression here ; others could be found in the supplementary material . in these graphics ,",
    "the observed values were labeled by 0 and 1 for absence and presence of a distress variable , respectively .",
    "whereas the conditional probabilities ranged almost between the lower and upper probability bounds , the marginal counterparts ranged in a narrower interval .",
    "for instance , while the marginal probabilities of being depressed at the period of 1990 - 1992 took only the values in the interval of ( 0.576 , 0.971 ) , the conditional probabilities ranged between 0.118 and 0.999 .",
    "this means that even the young people who had actually no depression for that period were assigned more probability of being depressed by the marginal models which would yield wrong decisions .",
    "this will be verified by two different accuracy measures at the end of this subsection . on the other hand ,",
    "the conditional probabilities were spread widely and they yielded higher rates of correct decisions .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig : depr.cond.vs.marg ] , the 0 s ( observing no depression for a young person ) were associated with lower conditional probabilities .",
    "the associated box - plots reflected the location and scale information of these marginal and conditional probabilities as well .",
    "for instance , whereas the box - plot of the conditional probabilities reflected a spread distribution and many outlying probabilities , the marginal counterparts reflected a stacked and narrow distribution .",
    "marginal models only rely on how well the covariates explain the variation of the responses and ignore the individual characteristics .",
    "put another way , two young people with same covariates but different unobserved features would have the same probability of being depressed based on the results of marginal models .",
    "however , in random effects models these individual features are accounted by the random effects parameters in addition to the covariate effects .",
    "the reason that marginal probabilities were stacked in a narrower interval and tended to assign high probabilities to the cases in which distress variables were absent was most probably due to these facts .",
    "we built simple linear regression models considering the probit of the conditional probabilities , @xmath206 , as dependent variables and the probit of the marginal probabilities , @xmath207 , as independent ones to measure how much the variation in the responses were explained by the covariates .",
    "r - squares of these models are presented in table [ tab : rsquared.marg.cond ] . we observed that covariates in the iyfp data did not explain the individual characteristics well , since only up to 33% of the individual variations were explained by the covariates .",
    "interactive graphics , for instance the ones obtained by ggobi software ( cook and swayne , 2007 ) , might help to identify interesting people .",
    "for instance , we detected a young person with id=223 who was a female with some negative life event experiences , no negative economical event experiences and cutbacks between 1 and 5 ( except in 1992 at which her family did not experience any cutbacks ) and who actually never reported any distress at the period of 1989 - 1992 ( table [ tab : individual.prob ] ) .",
    "for this person , whereas the marginal model ( marginal in table [ tab : individual.prob ] ) indicated high probabilities of being distressed , conditional models ( conditional ) indicated low probabilities .",
    "this means that the latter is more likely to yield correct inferences and the advantage of it is due to the estimation of individual characteristics .",
    "for instance , the empirical bayes estimate of @xmath208 was found to be @xmath209 .",
    "this indicates that this person was less likely to report distress compared to an average person .",
    "@xmath210{depr_89_black.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{depr_90_92_black.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    conditional probabilities can also be calculated by assuming that the person is an average person ( @xmath211 ) , i.e. , @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "these are still subject / time / response specific probabilities , since @xmath26 holds subject / time / response specific information .",
    "for instance , whereas at 1992 the probability of having anxiety for the young person with id=223 was estimated as 0.64 by the marginal model , this probability was calculated as 0.08 by the conditional model . moreover , the conditional probability assuming that the person was an average person was estimated as 0.46 . however , as expected , the latter probabilities were not as successful as the conditional probabilities , yet they seemed to be better than the marginal probabilities .",
    "longitudinal binary data sets almost surely include subjects who constantly report absence ( 0 ) or presence ( 1 ) of a binary variable at all time points .",
    "for instance , in the iyfp data set , these subjects were the ones who reported absence or presence of anxiety , hostility and/or depression through all the follow - ups .",
    "note that the subject with id=223 constantly reported the absence of all distress variables .",
    "we identified such subjects in the iyfp data set in terms of three distress variables one - by - one and altogether .",
    "the counts and related percentages are given in table [ tab : stayer.table ] .",
    "there were considerable amount of subjects who reported the same answer through all study years .",
    "for instance , 29.7% of the subjects reported 1 for all the three distress variables at all the time points .",
    "we calculated marginal and conditional probabilities for these subjects and summarized these probabilities in spagetti plots .",
    "due to page limits , only the spagetti plot for the anxiety probability of subjects who reported the same answer for all three distress variables was included here ( figure [ fig : depr.stayers.all ] ) . in this figure , while the gray lines represent the subjects who always reported 1 , the black lines represent the ones who always reported 0 . it was observed that the predictions were unsuccessful when a marginal model was used . with this model ,",
    "the probability of distress was estimated high for all the young people who stayed at a single answer .",
    "in other words , the model was unable to distinguish the subjects who reported no stress over all years from the ones who reported stress through all follow - ups . on the other hand , our conditional probabilities were very successful at correctly assigning the success probabilities for these subjects ; higher probabilities for subjects reporting 1 and lower probabilities for those who reported 0 .",
    "other spagetti plots indicated similar inferences ( see the supplementary material ) .        finally , we considered two different accuracy measures to summarize the predicted probabilities .",
    "these measures are expected proportion of correct prediction ( herron , 1999 ) and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( auroc ) .",
    "results ( not shown here ) showed that the inferences drawn from conditional models outperformed the ones drawn from the marginal models .",
    "this difference was apparent especially in terms of auroc .",
    "for instance , while the value of the auroc value for response = depression at 1990 - 1992 was found to be 0.684 for marginal models , this value was found to be 0.864 for the conditional models .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a marginalized model for multivariate longitudinal binary data . the use of mle and _ probit _ link facilitated the computations over bm and _ logit _ link . we proposed the use of implicit function theorem to solve the marginal constraint equations directly . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this application was proposed for the first time here in marginalized structured models .",
    "an r package * pnmtrem * was proposed to fit pntrem(1 ) , which was tested under different conditions with small studies . for the details and usage of the related function and examples ,",
    "we refer the researchers to the package manual .",
    "the estimation of random effect coefficients within this package also allowed subject specific comparisons .",
    "we illustrated our model on the iyfp data set and discussed related parameter interpretations as well as subject specific inferences through the predicted probabilities .",
    "a natural extension of our work here would be fitting higher order pnmtrem , pnmtem(p ) with @xmath214",
    ". the variances of random effects could be modified by a subset of covariates , i.e. , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is a possible subset of covariates and @xmath217 are the related parameters .",
    "also , the random effects might be assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution , i.e. , @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a @xmath220 matrix .",
