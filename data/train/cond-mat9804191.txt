    "the second aspect is related to the topological change in mutual properties of the fs in the vicinities of two different sp s and leads to the logarithmic divergence of spin density and charge density susceptibilities of noninteracting electrons .",
    "this divergence has an `` excitonic '' nature in the sense that the topology of two electron bands around two different sp s is such that no energy is needed to excite an electron - hole pair .",

    "we consider a spin - dependent interaction of the af sign and respectively the sdw phase .",
    "strange about this phase is that the critical line has an unusual shape as a function of @xmath18 in the regime @xmath5 : * it increases with increasing the distance from qcp * instead of having the form of a `` bell '' around qcp as it is usually happens for an ordered phase developing around an ordinary quantum critical point and as indeed it occurs on the side @xmath4 .",
    "the reason is that * the ordered phase develops rather `` around '' the line @xmath9 than around the quantum critical point at @xmath19*. we call this instability the * sdw `` excitonic '' instability * in order to distinguish it from the sdw instability associated with nesting of fermi surface occuring in the case @xmath20 . in the latter case",
    "all anomalies discovered in the paper disappear .",
    "the reason is discussed in @xcite .    the line @xmath9 plays a very important role also for the disordered metallic state out of the sdw `` excitonic '' ordered phase .",
    "we show that it is a line * of almost phase transition*. the correlation length increases when approaching this line at fixed doping from high and * from low * temperature , relaxation processes slow down etc .",
    "the metallic state below the line @xmath9 is quite strange . on one hand ,",
    "it exhibits a reentrant behaviour becoming more rigid with increasing temperature . on the other hand , dependences of the correlation length and of the parameter @xmath21 ( which describes a proximity to the ordered sdw `` excitonic '' phase ) on doping",
    "are extremely weak .",
    "it leads to the unusual behaviour : in this regime the system remains effectively in a proximity of the ordered sdw phase for all dopind levels even quite far from @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the metallic state below the line @xmath9 and out of the ordered sdw `` excitonic '' phase is a * reentrant in temperature and almost frozen in doping rigid sdw liquid*. this state is characterized by numerous anomalies , some of them are considered in the paper .",
    "the existence of this state frozen in doping has very important consequences when considering the situation in the presence of sc phase .",
    "since the line @xmath23 is always leaning out of the sc phase , the normal state at @xmath24 is quite strange : being located in a proximity of the sc phase in fact it keeps a memory about the sdw `` excitonic '' phase .",
    "it is this feature which on our opinion is crucial for understanding the anomalous behaviour in the underdoped regime of high-@xmath6 cuprates .",
    "in the end of the sec.iii we discuss briefly an anomalous behaviour of physical characteristics corresponding to those measured by nmr and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",
    "the discovered anomalies are in a good agreement with nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath25 and nuclear transverse relaxation rate @xmath26 experimental data on copper ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss also a possible reason for the different behaviour of @xmath25 on copper and oxygen @xcite .",

    "the behaviour of the system is very asymmetrical on two sides of the ett , the point @xmath1 appears _ as the end of the critical line of static kohn singularities _ in the polarizability of noninteracting electrons which exists on one side of qcp , @xmath4 . on the other side , @xmath5 , kohn singularity manifests itself as the line of the dynamic singularities .",
    "the dynamic singularities at @xmath2 are transforming into static anomalies at finite temperature .",

    "we study some of the anomalies .",
    "for example we show that the line of instability of the initial metallic state against sdw or cdw order ( depending on the type of interaction ) has the anomalous form : it grows from the qcp with increasing the distance from qcp instead of having the ordinary form of the bell around qcp .",
    "we show that in the metallic state out of this phase there is a characteristic temperature for each electron concentration , @xmath227 , which is the temperature of an almost phase transition : a rigidity of the metallic state and the correlation length are maximal at @xmath250 when approaching from above and from below .",

    "the existence of the logarithmic singularity in the density of states for 2d case was first shown by e. montroll @xcite for the case of phonon density of states .",
    "scaling is the main property of a quantum critical point . in sec.ii.c",
    "we gave scaling forms for @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "the functions @xmath313 and @xmath314 can also be shown to scale with the scaling variable @xmath315 and a very anomalous scaling function .",
    "this point will be discussed in another paper .",
    "no true finite @xmath60 ordered state is possible in 2d system in the case of continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian and only a possible kosterlitz - thouless transition is expected .",
    "rpa finite @xmath60 transitions should be interpreted for pure 2d system as crossover signaling the appearence of large but finite correlation length .",
    "however a weak 3d coupling or small anisotropy of the hamiltonian are sufficient to induce true lro .",
    "the form ( [ 34 ] ) is close to the phenomenological susceptibility introduced by a.millis et al @xcite if one considers @xmath316 .",
    "[ this form has been used in many following papers by d.pines et al ( see for example @xcite ) and a.chubukov et al ( see for example @xcite ) ] as we have shown this form is valid only for very low @xmath110 , @xmath317 . for higher @xmath110 , there is an effect of the effective `` pseudogap '' .",
    "we mean that @xmath51 is no more constant when @xmath110 is not extremely small , see fig.8 .",
    "another important difference is that this form represents only fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath96 .",
    "as we have shown in sec.ii there is also a singularity of @xmath215 in the vicinity of @xmath214 and the fluctuations related to that .",
    "their behaviour is very different from the behaviour of fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath96 that leads to an independent behaviour of @xmath318 and @xmath319 as functions of @xmath60 and @xmath39 .",
    "and finally and most important is that the parameters in the form ( [ 34 ] ) behave in a very untrivial way as functions of @xmath60 and @xmath18 as discussed in the text .",
    "analysis of the behaviour of the parameter @xmath320 describing a proximity to sc phase is performed in details in @xcite ; however it is clear from the breaf analysis performed in the subsec.iie that it behaves in the ordinary way , i.e. increases quite rapidly when one goes away from the critical line @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , except for an intime vicinity of @xmath229 , it is valid : @xmath321 ."
