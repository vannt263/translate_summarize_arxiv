    "first we present the following theorem .",
    "we say that @xmath2 has a _ cusp _ singularity at @xmath3 if @xmath4 or @xmath5 for some local coordinates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which are compatible with the orientations .",
    "the former is called a _ cusp birth _ and the latter a _ cusp death_.",
    "if the fundamental group of the complement of a smooth embedding @xmath0 is a cyclic group , then there is a generic one - parameter family of smooth maps @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is the standard embedding , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a self - transverse immersion except for finitely many @xmath12 s where @xmath11 has only one cusp singularity .",
    "if @xmath11 has a first cusp singularity at @xmath13 , then @xmath11 is an embedding for @xmath14 and @xmath11 has a self - intersection point for @xmath15 .",
    "the second cusp either leads a birth of another self - intersection point or leads to the death of the first self - intersection point and so on .",
    "a self - intersection point appears or disappears at a cusp birth or a cusp death respectively .",
    "theorem  1 is easily extended to a connected embedded surface in @xmath7 . in the case of non - orientable surfaces",
    "there are several unknotted embeddings which are not isotopic because they have different normal euler numbers but they are connected by such a deformation .",
    "kamada also gave a proof of the generalized version of theorem  1 in [ 2 ] .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the image of two embedded 2spheres .",
    "these 2knots can be equivalent in the following three senses .",
    "( 1)they are _ cusp equivalent _ if they are connected by a generic one - parameter family @xmath18 of smooth maps such that @xmath11 is a self - transverse immersion except for finitely many values of @xmath12 at which @xmath11 has only one cusp singularity .",
    "( 2)they are _ stably equivalent _ if they are ambient isotopic after trivial 1handles are attached .",
    "that is , they are ambient isotopic after a genus @xmath19 unknotted orientable surface is attached as a connected summand to each .",
    "( 3)they are _ weakly stably equivalent _ if , for some @xmath20 , they are ambient isotopic in @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath11 is a generic deformation with at most cusp singularities , then the fundamental group of the complement is kept constant during the deformation .",
    "we have the following theorem .",
    "assume that two smooth 2knots @xmath22 and @xmath23 are cusp equivalent .",
    "then they are stably equivalent .",
    "theorem 2 is easily generalized to the case of embedded orientable surfaces of positive genus . in the case of embedded non - orientable surfaces",
    "we need the additional condition that they have the same normal euler numbers .",
    "stably equivalent 2knots @xmath24 and @xmath25 are weakly stably equivalent .",
    "theorem  1 should be known to specialists who are familiar both with 2knot theory and singularity theory .",
    "but since it would give a starting point for a possible proof of the smooth 4dimensional unknotting conjecture , i would like to dedicate this short paper to professor r kirby .",
    "i would also like to thank the referee who read the manuscript carefully and offered a beautiful figure to simplify the proof of theorem  2 .",
    "since any two maps of @xmath6 into @xmath7 are mutually homotopic , there is a generic one - parameter family of smooth maps @xmath26 connecting @xmath9 and @xmath27 . by dimensional reasoning ,",
    "the generic births and deaths of self - intersection points have only two types ; finger moves and cusps .",
    "in fact at a finite number of @xmath12 s the image of @xmath11 has a cusp or a partial tangency of two local sheets . by a finger move we mean the local deformation including the latter non - transverse case",
    "; a finger pushes a local sheet until it penetrates another local sheet .",
    "we get a pair of self - intersection points after the penetration with one plus and one minus intersection number .",
    "note that the reverse process of the finger move is a whitney trick .",
    "we may think that the finger move follows along a curve @xmath28 that connects two points of @xmath6 .",
    "if the fundamental group of the complement is a cyclic group generated by the element encircling the surface , the curve @xmath28 is homotopically trivial relative boundary and hence isotopically trivial ; so , we get a 2disk @xmath29 with two corners and @xmath30 . now it is not difficult to decompose this finger move into two cusp births .",
    "the reverse deformation around the cusp birth , that is , the cusp death process can be described by the collapsing of a 2disk @xmath29 with one corner such that @xmath31 and the corner point on the boundary is the self - intersection point .",
    "moreover we have two types of cusps for the cusp birth ; one gives a positive intersection point and another gives a negative one for the appearing immersed surface .",
    "if the finger move is isotopically trivial , we can construct a pair of disjoint collapsing 2disks for the pair of positive and negative self - intersection points and get a pair of positive and negative cusps .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  1 . for another proof one may consult the manuscript written by kamada [ 2 ] .    before giving a proof of theorem  2 we recall the definition of trivial 1handles . an embedded product , @xmath32 , of a 2disk @xmath33 and an interval @xmath34 in @xmath7",
    "is said to _ span _",
    "@xmath6 _ as a 1handle _ if @xmath35 and the surface obtained by the surgery according to @xmath36 has an orientation compatible with the original one .",
    "the circle @xmath37 parallel to the boundary of @xmath38 is considered .",
    "the 1handle is called _ trivial _ if there is a 2disk @xmath29 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 a point .    by a _ smoothing of a transverse double point _ we mean replacing a neighborhood of the transverse double point with a standard annulus connecting the components of a hopf link in the boundary 3sphere .",
    "when the surface is oriented , the smoothing should respect the orientation and the isotopy class of the resulting surface is uniquely determined . since a cusp birth",
    "is described also by @xmath41 , an oriented smoothing of the double point appearing at the cusp birth is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    0.1 in -0.1 in    we can find easily @xmath32 and @xmath29 of a trivial 1handle in the figure .",
    "if the sign of the cusp birth is reversed , the upper and lower curves at the crossing in the figure are reversed .",
    "so , we obtain :    let @xmath42 be an oriented immersed surface in @xmath7 , and let @xmath43 be a surface obtained from @xmath42 by a single cusp birth .",
    "let @xmath44 be obtained from @xmath43 by smoothing the double point that appears following the cusp birth",
    ". then @xmath44 is obtained from @xmath42 by surgery along a trivial 1handle .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath46 be embedded 2spheres in @xmath7 that are cusp equivalent .",
    "the one - parameter family @xmath18 can be deformed so that any cusp birth takes place at @xmath47 and any cusp death takes place at @xmath48 .",
    "so we may assume that there is an immersed 2sphere @xmath49 in @xmath7 such that @xmath50 can be obtained from either @xmath51 or @xmath52 by attaching @xmath53 cusps for some @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the embedded surface obtained from @xmath50 by smoothing all the double points of @xmath50 .",
    "the result follows from the previous lemma .",
    "i thank the referee for offering the use of figure  [ fig1 ] which simplifies the proof of theorem  2 greatly .",
    "the surface which is obtained by attaching @xmath55 trivial 1handles is a connected sum of the original 2knot and an unknotted surface @xmath54 of genus @xmath55 in the sense of [ 1 ] .",
    "since the bounding solid tori for the unknotted surfaces @xmath54 are ambient isotopic to each other by corollary  1.6 of [ 1 ] , we may assume that there is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism @xmath56 of @xmath7 to itself which not only satisfies @xmath57 but also preserves the circles @xmath58 s determined by the trivial 1handles .",
    "now we consider each trivial 1handle .",
    "perform surgery along the loop on the embedded surface which intersects the circle @xmath58 at one point for the trivial 1handle recursively .",
    "we have to respect the stable framing when making the surgery .",
    "then we get a 2knot in the new ambient manifold , the connected sum of @xmath7 with @xmath55 copies of @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the core 2disk of the surgery disk and @xmath61 the original whitney type 2disk for the trivial 1handle .",
    "the 2disks @xmath61 s depend on each of the original 2knots .",
    "if we do surgery on the new ambient manifold along each 2sphere @xmath62 , we get the original 2knot in @xmath7 .",
    "so , doing the reversing surgery @xmath55 times for the complement of each of @xmath63 and @xmath51 again , we get theorem  3 .",
    "the generalization of theorem  1 to an embedded connected surface in @xmath7 is straightforward .    in the case of",
    "@xmath64 we have a generic one - parameter family with only a pair of cusp births and deaths connecting the unknotted surfaces with normal euler numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here",
    "the normal euler number means half of the intersection number of the zero section of the induced disk bundle for the normal bundle of the immersed unoriented surface with respect to its orientable 2covering .",
    "the proof of theorem  2 is easily generalized to an oriented surface of positive genus because the sign of a cusp birth or death is determined by the intersection number of the self - intersection point of the central oriented immersed surface . also , if the intersection number of the self - intersection point is positive or negative , its contribution to the normal euler number of the immersed surface is @xmath66 or @xmath67 respectively [ 3 ] and the procedure of lemma annuls this contribution in the case of oriented smoothing .",
    "but in the case of non - orientable surfaces we can not distinguish a positive or negative cusp after it turns into a self - intersection point .",
    "so , a double point which appears at a positive cusp birth may terminate at a negative cusp death . in this case",
    "the smoothing double point can not respect the local orientation near the cusp and if the cusp birth is smoothed by attaching a trivial 1handle then the cusp death is smoothed by attaching two unknotted @xmath64 s with the same euler number .",
    "nevertheless , if the normal euler numbers of two embeddings @xmath9 and @xmath27 are the same , the number of positive cusp births and positive cusp deaths should be equal and similarly the number of negative ones .",
    "hence , if a self - intersection point born at a positive cusp dies at a negative cusp , there is also a self - intersection point born at a negative cusp and dieing at a positive cusp and vice versa .",
    "so , if the cusp births are smoothed by attaching 1handles , then the cusp deaths are smoothed by attaching the connected sum of unknotted tori and @xmath64 s with zero total euler number . since the connected sums of the unknotted @xmath64 with the unknotted torus and with two unknotted @xmath64 s with euler number @xmath66 and @xmath65 are isotopic , cusp equivalent non - orientable surfaces with the same euler number are stably equivalent after possibly taking connected sum of each with an unknotted @xmath64 .",
    "if the notion of stable equivalence for non - orientable surfaces is enlarged to include the connected sum with unknotted @xmath64 s , then we can drop the hypothesis that the normal euler numbers are the same .",
    "as for theorem 3 , if the 1handles are preserved by an ambient isotopy for stably equivalent embedded surfaces , they are easily shown to be weakly stably equivalent .",
    "we expect this to be true in general but we might have some difficulties even in the orientable case ."
