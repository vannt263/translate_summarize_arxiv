    "the detection of planets around stars in our galaxy is one of the most exciting recent discoveries in astronomy .",
    "the first planets were not detected directly but through their effect on their parent star .",
    "the very first discovery of an exoplanet by @xcite involved a planet around a pulsar , and the first exoplanet detected around a solar type star was through the radial velocity ( rv ) reflex motion of the parent star 51 peg @xcite . these massive , short - period planets implied that some of them would transit their parent star , and one such planet was found to transit its parent star , hd209458b @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of this so - called hot - jupiter many more transiting planets have been found , with as most prolific contributor being the transit mission kepler @xcite that has detected over 2300 planetary candidates so far @xcite . for both rv and transit",
    "searches the observing efficiency decreases sharply with increasing orbital period .",
    "direct imaging of extrasolar planets is required to study solar - system - like exoplanets .",
    "in addition to direct detections , high - contrast imaging methods allow for the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through photometry ( variability implying clouds ) and spectroscopy , and are not restricted to the transit window of the planet .",
    "the most prominent success story for direct imaging is the 4-planet system around hr8799 @xcite , for which the chemical composition of hr8799 c implies a core accretion formation mechanism @xcite .",
    "direct imaging is highly challenging because of the large contrast between the star and the planet ( typically @xmath5 for visible light reflected from the sun by jupiter to @xmath6 for direct thermal emission from young gas giant planets in formation ) , the small angular separation between the star and the planet ( typically 1 arcsecond or less ) , and the effects of diffraction of the stellar light due to the finite size of the telescope .",
    "the diffraction halo of the primary star ( the point spread function - psf ) at the location of the planet can be several decades brighter than the planet itself .",
    "contrast from the ground is furthermore limited by a halo of speckles created by imperfect adaptive optics ( ao ) correction of atmospheric turbulence and optical aberrations that are not corrected by the ao system as they are not sensed by the wavefront sensor .",
    "removing the diffraction halo by telescope modeling or observing a nearby reference star is not effective because the optics of the telescope changes as a function of time , and hence the resulting psf is variable at the pertinent levels of contrast .",
    "the speckles that result from incorrect psf subtraction are similar in shape to the planets that are the target of our search .",
    "several differential techniques for improving psf subtraction have been developed and are used to obtain roughly an additional order of magnitude in suppression : angular differential imaging @xcite , spectral differential imaging @xcite , spectral deconvolution @xcite and polarimetric differential imaging for scattered light sources ( see @xcite for a recent example ) .",
    "the intensity of the speckles is related to the telescope wavefront error and the intensity of the diffraction structure at the location of the planet @xcite . by suppressing the diffraction structure from the central star the effect of the intensity of the corresponding speckles",
    "is also reduced .",
    "coronagraphs are angular filters designed to reject light from the direction of the star while transmitting as much light as possible from the direction of the planet . originally developed for the study of the solar corona @xcite ,",
    "several different designs have been considered for use in direct imaging of exoplanets ( for recent comprehensive reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "new - generation coronagraphs such as the apodizing phase plate and annular groove phase mask coronagraph have been in use at near - infrared wavelengths in ground - based telescopes @xcite . out of the wide family of coronagraphic designs , those which use focal - plane amplitude and/or phase masks to suppress the on - axis starlight are sensitive to both the finite angular size of the star and tip - tilt vibrations within the telescope structure .",
    "coronagraphs which modify the complex amplitude of the pupil plane only are not susceptible to these problems .",
    "modifications of the pupil through amplitude apodization @xcite and phase apodization @xcite are possible and can provide a combination of large suppression of starlight and high throughput of the light of a planet at small angular separations from the central star . in @xcite the theory of pupil apodization in one dimension was developed and extended for square apertures .",
    "pupil apodization over circular apertures was further developed in @xcite with iterative gerchberg - saxton algorithms , clearing out regions in the focal plane at typically 5 @xmath0 and larger .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed and realized phase coronagraphs at smaller inner working angles .",
    "the largest advantages of pupil - plane over focal - plane coronagraphs are the small inner working angle , easy accommodation of complex pupil shapes ( segments / spiders ) and its insensitivity to tip - tilt variations .",
    "one disadvantage of a stand - alone pupil - plane coronagraph is that all the stellar light still reaches the detector , which leads to dynamic range issues .    the original apodizing phase plate ( app ) @xcite introduces a phase variation across the telescope pupil by varying the thickness of a plate as a function of position in the pupil , and has been used successfully to directly image exoplanets ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the app these thickness variations",
    "are typically diamond - turned into a substrate with a high refractive index .",
    "the two limiting factors for this app design are ( 1 ) it is inherently chromatic and ( 2 ) it only delivers 180 degrees field of suppression .",
    "however , the implementation of phase control through the _ vector phase _ solves these two problems , and enables an improved version of the app coronagraph , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "the much improved performance for the vector apodizing phase plate ( vapp ) is achieved with a combination of liquid crystal techniques : the phase pattern can be written in a photo - alignment material @xcite with a direct - write scanning system @xcite .",
    "broadband performance is achieved by applying multiple layers of self - aligning liquid crystals ( multi - twist retarders ; mtr ) , that together yield an achromatized retardance @xcite , which extends the efficiency of the inherently achromatic vector - phase application over a large wavelength range .    in this paper",
    "we present the characterization of the first vapp prototype , which creates dark holes in two complementary psfs over a broad wavelength range ( 500900 nm ) . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe the principle behind the vapp . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we directly characterize the manufactured optic through narrowband imaging at multiple wavelengths .",
    "using these measurements we then model the psf in the focal plane in section [ sec:4 ] and compare it with measurements of the psf in the laboratory .",
    "we present our conclusions and provide outlooks for future improvements in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the app coronagraph uses optical path differences to induce a phase change as a function of position across the pupil .",
    "one such phase pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : app_phase ] . in this case , a phase pattern @xmath7 is introduced by varying the thickness @xmath8 of a high refractive index material .",
    "the expression relating @xmath7 to @xmath8 is given in eq .",
    "where @xmath4 is the wavelength , @xmath9 is the refractive index of the coronagraph and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11    this phase is clearly chromatic with a @xmath12 term and a dispersion term for the glass .",
    "the vapp coronagraph instead makes use of the geometric phase , also sometimes called the vector phase , which is a manifestation of the pancharatnam - berry phase @xcite .",
    "this approach was previously used for focal - plane phase masks like the 4qpm ( with quartz/@xmath13 achromatic waveplates ) by @xcite , the 8opm ( with photonic crystals ) by @xcite , the vector vortex coronagraph by @xcite , and introduced for the vapp by @xcite .",
    "the vector phase arises when a circularly polarized beam passes through a half - wave retarder and is converted into circularly polarized light of the opposite handedness .",
    "while the circular polarization handedness flip is independent from the half - wave retarder s axis orientation , the absolute phase of the emergent beam is directly determined by it . in this way ,",
    "even a perfectly flat optic can induce a phase pattern .",
    "moreover , as the phase is only determined by the fast axis orientation , it is inherently achromatic .",
    "the electric components of a beam of polarized light can be described by a jones vector .",
    "using the jones formalism to express the effect of a half - wave plate ( hwp ) with a fast axis oriented at @xmath14 on circular polarization states we can write @xmath15 where the rotation matrix is @xmath16 the jones matrix of the hwp @xmath17 adopting circularly polarized input states @xmath18 gives us @xmath19 which shows that the input circular polarization has flipped its sign and received a phase delay equal to @xmath20 it can be seen that the expression of the vector phase has a positive or negative phase depending on the handedness of the circularly polarized light , and is independent of wavelength . if the retarder is not perfectly half - wave , the handedness - flip is incomplete and leakage terms emerge @xcite .",
    "unpolarized light can be decomposed into equal components of the orthogonal circular polarization states , and therefore half of the light accrues a positive phase while the other half receives a negative phase . since the app phase pattern is anti - symmetric , the negative phase corresponding to opposite circular polarization yields a point - reflected psf compared to the psf of the positive phase",
    "this can be easily understood by looking at the properties of the fourier transform .",
    "the sign flip of the phase pattern is equivalent to the complex conjugation of the electric field pattern in the pupil .",
    "the fourier transform of the two pupil functions yields electric field structures in the focal plane that are point - reflected ( @xmath21\\rightarrow[-x ,- y]$ ] ) complex conjugates .",
    "the psfs ( square of the modulus of the electric field pattern in the focal plane ) for the two circular polarization states therefore exhibit point - reflection symmetry . in the case of an anti - symmetric pupil phase pattern ,",
    "the two psfs are mirror - symmetric .",
    "therefore , if the light is split based on the handedness of the emerging beam we obtain two distinct images of the same source but with opposite sides cleared out . figure [ fig : vapp_principle ]",
    "shows a sketch of the vector app coronagraph . in this case , the beam - splitting according to circular polarization states is achieved by introducing a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) and wollaston prism behind the vapp .",
    "the qwp converts the circular polarizations into linear polarizations that are split by the wollaston prism .",
    "we use liquid crystal techniques to create the desired pattern retarder , which has a retardance close to half - wave over a large wavelength range . while a single layer of in - plane , uniaxial nematic liquid crystal formed into the vapp pattern produces output waves with phase following eq .",
    ", it nevertheless has a very chromatic retardance , i.e. , proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this means that only a narrow band of wavelengths will experience a half - wave retardance , even approximately . at other wavelengths ,",
    "the large deviations from half - wave retardance create leakage of the original psf .",
    "an achromatized half - wave retarder can be created by coating multiple layers of chiral liquid crystals , each with its own thickness and helical twist @xcite .",
    "this static thin film with multiple sublayers is called a multi - twist retarder ( mtr ) .",
    "in addition to its broadband performance , the other key advantage of this birefringent film is that the local fast axis of each layer spontaneously self - aligns to the fast axis of the prior layer , implying that only one patterning step for a single photoalignment material is needed .",
    "furthermore , in this work , we direct - write the vapp fast axis orientation pattern using a scanned laser spot , a direct - write lithography technique @xcite , which has the advantageous feature of being able to record _ any _ phase pattern .      the vapp prototype characterized in this paper is made on a substrate ( schott d263 glass ) with a diameter of 25.4 mm and a thickness of 1.1 mm .",
    "the first layer applied to the glass is a linearly photo - polymerized polymer ( lpp @xcite ) , which defines the local optical axis orientation for subsequent layers and therefore the fast axis of the whole device .",
    "a linearly polarized uv laser ( 325 nm ) encodes the app phase as a position - dependent fast axis orientation pattern into the lpp layer with a spatial resolution of 25 microns .",
    "the angle of polarization varies with a rotating half - wave plate @xcite in order to locally enforce the polymerization direction to follow the required phase pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : app_phase ] ) .",
    "note that a factor of two in angle is applied to the phase pattern , cf .",
    ".  [ eq : vector ] . after the curing of the lpp , successive layers of liquid crystal form the achromatized , patterned half - wave retarder . the multilayer design compensates for the chromaticity of individual layers by a combination of varying thicknesses , twists and birefringences . for our prototype ,",
    "we use three total layers ( i.e. , a 3tr design @xcite ) of liquid crystal polymers and cure each layer with a uv led source .",
    "the properties of the individual mtr layers are given by [ @xmath22 , @xmath23 m , @xmath24 , @xmath25 m , @xmath26 , @xmath27 m ] where @xmath28 denotes the local fast axis orientation and @xmath29 the thickness of each layer . in more detail ; the process involves spin - coating successive layers of a mixture containing polymerizeable liquid crystal monomers and potentially chiral dopants within a solvent , and results in a solid cross - linked polymer film .",
    "further details of the design method and fabrication principles are found in @xcite .",
    "an end - cap glass plate with a broadband anti - reflection coating is added .",
    "the multilayer liquid crystal structure creates a retardance that is designed to be approximately half - wave between 500 and 900 nanometers . to minimize the leakage of the regular psf to a level comparable to the theoretical contrast of the coronagraph we specify a maximum retardance offset . by comparing the contrast in a 135 degree wedge from 2 to 7 @xmath0 for the normal psf and the theoretical app psf for the adopted phase pattern",
    "we see that we can tolerate a leakage of 7.3% .",
    "the intensity of the leakage term as a function of the retardance offset @xmath30 is approximately @xmath31 @xcite , and from this we derive that the maximum retardance offset that can be tolerated is @xmath32 . the mtr design for the vapp prototype is selected to fall within this requirement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : measured_retardance ] ) .",
    "a coronagraph design with improved contrast will have a stronger requirement on the retardance offset .",
    "for instance , a design with a 10 times better theoretical contrast requires a maximum retardance offset of 0.17 radians , and/or the application of leakage filtering with circular polarization filters on either side of the vapp @xcite .",
    "while the mtr design used for the vapp prototype is optimized to create an approximately half - wave retardance across a broad wavelength range , the fast axis zero point is left unconstrained .",
    "the effect of the zero point is a global rotation of the fast axis and therefore a harmless global piston offset of the phase of the emergent beam as a function of wavelength .",
    "the dependance of the zero point on the wavelength is derived from the theoretical 3-layer mtr mueller matrices and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fastaxisoffset ] .",
    "this feature creates a paradoxically colorful appearance when viewing the broadband vapp prototype in between polarizers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vapp_plate ] ) .",
    "an amplitude mask is made using a substrate with the same specification as is used for the patterned liquid crystal .",
    "a layer of opaque ( black ) resist , with a transmissive annulus with an inner diameter of 1.1 mm and outer diameter of 5.5 mm is applied to this substrate .",
    "the transmission of this mask is measured to be lower than @xmath33 .",
    "this amplitude mask is manually aligned to the other substrate under a microscope and bonded with optical glue .",
    "the completed optic can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vapp_plate ] .",
    "[ sec:3 ] detailed characterization of the broadband optical behavior ( i.e. , transmission , retardance , and fast axis ) of the vapp is necessary not only to verify if the plate is functioning according to specifications , but also to identify solutions to perfect the current design and reach the performance needed to accommodate more complex coronagraphs .",

    "[ fig : phase_map ] . the reconstructed phase map ( i.e.  two times the retarder axis orientation pattern ) is remarkably similar to the input pattern",
    "although small , local deviations can be discerned . especially at the 270 degree and 150 degree clock - wise positions",
    "two peculiar phase deviations can be seen .",
    "these are due to dust specks that landed on the substrate during manufacturing and locally created a thicker layer of polymers .",
    "the pile - up of polymers causes an offset in retardance and phase .",
    "the non - zero residuals in the phase shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_map ] are partially caused by measurement errors .",
    "the fuzzy edges that trace out some of the phase pattern are evidence of this .",
    "the phase folds back at the extremes of the arccosine function in eq .",
    ", where the derivative of the arccosine is large and a small change in the ratio can cause a big difference in phase .",
    "measurement noise is therefore very pronounced at these locations .",
    "furthermore , there is a small phase jump at this location .",
    "simulations of the end - to - end measurement trace this phase jump back to a 1% residual background value in the original images .",
    "the use of a ( well - calibrated ) complete mueller matrix imaging polarimeter would reduce such issues , although some degeneracies would remain .",
    "in addition to these spurious effects , the phase pattern appears to have a small ( @xmath340.1 radians ) real deviation from the specified pattern ( see fig . [",
    "fig : zigzag ] in the appendix ) .",
    "this may be caused by instrumental polarization issues in the direct - write system .",
    "the retardance and transmission maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ret_trans_map ] together with the corresponding histograms . a hint of the phase pattern can be seen in the retardance map , because it is reconstructed simultaneously with the phase map .",
    "simulations show that this is caused by a shift of a few pixels between the four recorded images that are used to compute this map .",
    "this shift is caused by the different orientations of the polarizers that are required to derive the retardance and phase maps ( see appendix [ sec : appa1 ] ) .",
    "the polarizer is slightly tilted on purpose to remove reflection ghosts that would otherwise bias the characterization .",
    "furthermore , the average of the measured retardance map is offset from the theoretically expected value for the 3tr design .",
    "simulations using the mueller matrix model in appendix [ sec : appa1 ] show that this is caused by the propagation of noise in the recorded images .",
    "the transmission map shows a gradient across the pupil but does not show any print - through of the phase pattern .",
    "a global gradient of light going from a flux ratio of 1.25 to 0.75 across the pupil is seen in the topleft panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ret_trans_map ] . to investigate the cause of this gradient we divide the app pupil image by a flat field image created by removing the vapp optic .",
    "inspection of this image shows no gradients in transmission across the app optic to within 1% .",
    "we conclude that the gradient seen in the pupil transmission image is caused by an asymmetric illumination of the pupil .",
    "amplitude variations can be seen at several locations on the pupil image .",
    "the long black fringes are scratches in the cover window of the ccd and the circular fringes are from dust specks on the lenses located close to the vapp",
    ". these effects can be corrected by improving the optical setup .",
    "other amplitude effects are in the coronagraph itself and have to be solved in the manufacturing step .",
    "for instance , the small circles on this image are air bubbles and dust specks in the glue that binds the amplitude mask to the coronagraph .    finally in the lower",
    "left of the coronagraph image a small indentation is seen where the transmission is substantially lower .",
    "this seems to be a patch of resist that is sticking out of the amplitude mask . in the phase and retardance reconstruction",
    "the static amplitude variations are removed automatically . in the psf reconstruction presented in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] it is shown that these amplitude variations do not have a significant impact on the performance of the coronagraph .",
    "figure  [ fig : measured_retardance ] presents the measured offsets from half - wave retardance as a function of wavelength for the two different reconstruction techniques detailed in appendix [ sec : appa1 ] .",
    "the retardance values are measured as an average across the entire device .",
    "because the retardance reconstruction in eq . has a degeneracy , we plot the offset from half - wave retardance , which is the factor that determines leakage of the original psf .",
    "the 3-layer design approximates half - wave retardance for the specified spectral range of 500900 nm to within 0.3 radians or 17.2 degrees .",
    "the measurements of retardance as a function of wavelength well match the expected performance .",
    "the purple dots in fig . [ fig : measured_retardance ] represent the systematic error offset due to the photon noise ( see appendix [ sec : appa3 ] ) , and are a lower bound for the measurement error of the retardance offset .",
    "the large systematic error at 800 nm is caused by the very low photon efficiency of the used detector . at 750 nanometers both method a and b give significantly lower retardance offsets than the prediction . at 500 and 600 nm , the two employed methods do not agree , which is likely caused by fluctuations in the light source .",
    "radians as a function of wavelength . denoted in red and blue circles are the two different reconstruction methods .",
    "method a uses 4 pairs of images to solve for both the fast axis and the retardance while method b only looks the antisymmetry axis in pairs of images .",
    "overplotted in a dashed green line is the theoretical retardance curve for a 3-layer mtr .",
    "the pink circles represent the noise limit of the retardance measurement using the noise and flux of the real images to retrieve the retardance of a hwp that is exactly half - wave . at 750 and especially 800",

    "two psf spots with complementary dark holes are recorded in the focal plane . ]",
    "in directly imaging exoplanets , where the halo of the primary star dominates the flux at the location of the planet , it is important to know the intensity as a function of angular separation away from the central star .",
    "this is expressed in an azimuthally averaged radial light profile called a contrast curve .",

    "the sensitivity of a coronagraph for a given observation can be calculated .",
    "we therefore model the theoretical psf of the vapp as a function of wavelength based on the results of the pupil - plane measurements presented in the previous section and compare it to laboratory psf measurements .    in order to measure the psf of the vapp we use the laboratory setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_psf ] . the optics from the fiber to the vapp are identical to the pupil imaging setup in fig .",

    "a combination of an `` achromatic '' ( i.e. , quartz / mgf@xmath38 ) thorlabs quarter - wave plate ( aqwp05m-600 ) and a wollaston prism splits the two circular polarization states into two beams angularly separated by 0.5 degrees . a @xmath35 lens forms two psf images on the ccd camera ( sbig st2000xm ) .",
    "this optical setup is similar to the way a vapp would be implemented in a science camera on a telescope . with approximately 500 mm between the wollaston prism and the ccd ,",
    "the separation of the two complementary psfs is 4.36 mm .",
    "both psfs are simultaneously imaged on the ccd . at 400 nanometers",
    "the fwhm of the psf is about 22 microns , and with the 7.4 micron pixel size this means the psf is always nyquist - shannon sampled with at least 3 pixels per diffraction element .",
    "we require images with high dynamic contrast of at least @xmath1 to characterize the vapp psfs .",
    "the dynamic range of the camera is limited to approximately @xmath39 .",
    "we therefore combine images with different exposure times and construct a high dynamic range ( hdr ) image .",

    "is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_recon_750 ] .",
    "we attribute these differences at these angular separations to low - order wavefront aberrations in the re - imaging optics , variations in thickness of the vapp substrate and the wollaston prism . in figure",
    "[ fig : contrast3 ] we show that injecting 0.15 radians rms of third - order spherical aberrations results in excellent agreement of the model with the measured curve at these angular scales .",
    "such wavefront aberrations can be corrected in a telescope ( for at least one psf ) by offsetting the deformable mirror .",
    "in this paper we present the characterization of a prototype of the vector apodizing phase plate coronagraph . owing to the application of the vector phase applied by patterned multi - twist retarder liquid crystals ,",
    "the coronagraphic performance is achieved over an unprecedented wavelength range of 500900 nm in two complementary psfs . with lab measurements we characterize the phase pattern , the retardance and the transmission of the constructed vapp prototype , and measured and modeled the resultant psfs .",
    "we compared the measured psfs with the modeled psfs and find excellent agreement at all wavelengths and angular separations when all known non - ideal effects are included .",
    "the vapp provides up to two decades of suppression at 2 @xmath0 and keeps the diffraction halo at a level of @xmath2 of the peak intensity out to 7 @xmath0 as measured in a 135 degree wedge the retardance measurements show a wavelength behavior that is consistent with a 3-layer mtr , which provides coronagraphic performance over almost an order of magnitude wider in spectral bandwidth than the previous app coronagraph .",
    "still , the most significant degradation from the ideal app psf is due to offsets from half - wave retardance .",
    "subsequent iterations of vapp coronagraphs should therefore focus on improving the manufacturing technique with respect to the retardance and/or filter the leakage terms .",
    "the retardance as a function of wavelength could still be further improved by adding more liquid crystal layers .",
    "for instance , a 4-layer device has significantly better performance than the 3-layer design that was used in this research .",
    "the improvement to the theoretical retardance and contrast are shown in fig .",

    "this paper describes the performance of a 3-layer vapp device .",
    "the black dashed line shows the theoretical perfect contrast given the adopted phase pattern for a perfect half - wave retarder across all wavelengths . even though the contrast seems to bottom out for device with more than three layers ,",
    "the contrast could be improved by adopting a more extreme phase pattern with higher contrast . ]",
    "the contrast in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtr_contrast ] bottoms out as it reaches the limit of the adopted app phase pattern .",
    "owing to the direct - write technique , the vapp permits the adoption of more extreme phase patterns that reach much deeper ( theoretical ) contrasts ( e.g.   @xcite ) . using the 200 by 200 pixels of this prototype",
    "it can be calculated that the outer working angle can theoretically go up to 100 @xmath0 .",
    "the production of such an upgraded vapp coronagraph will be subject to more demanding production tolerances .",
    "particularly the retardance offsets will need to be much smaller than for the current prototype , or the spectral bandwidth will need to be decreased .",
    "however , the leakage terms can also be avoided by applying circular polarization filtering on either side of the vapp @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution is found by integration of the circular polarization beam - splitting in the vapp , by using a polarization grating @xcite . in this case , all leakage terms end up in a third , unaberrated psf .",
    "more extreme vapp devices will also be more demanding in terms of the phase pattern itself .",
    "the accuracy of the fast axis orientation ( and hence the vector phase ) pattern depends on the accuracy of the angle of linear polarization of the uv laser that is used for the photo - alignment layer .",
    "the latest manufacturing setup has a pockels cell to better control this angle and dramatically increases the speed at which the phase patterns are realized .",
    "furthermore , the instrumental polarization issues due to the fold mirror should be avoided .",
    "the measurement setup that we use for the reconstruction of the vapp device properties is relatively easy to implement and use , but it has several limitations .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstruction is dominated by the photon noise on the input images .",
    "unfortunately , the small fiber and narrowband filters attenuate light and therefore require long exposure times .",
    "the light source exhibits fluctuations especially within the first few hours after being switched on , which influence the accuracy of the reconstruction .",
    "the reconstruction method removes first order fluctuations of the light but is sensitive to fluctuations between measurements at orthogonal angles of the polarizer . by using a brighter light source , a larger diameter fiber , and/or a camera with better quantum efficiency we can minimize these effects by reducing measurement noise and taking the orthogonal exposures with shorter time intervals",
    "another solution for the fluctuations would be to independently monitor the light flux out of the fiber to allow for normalization in data reduction .    while the coronagraph in this paper is designed to work at visible wavelengths , most high - contrast imaging instruments typically work at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "fortunately the wavelength range at which the plate optimally works can be optimized by a judicial choice of different liquid crystals and substrates for the vapp . using these methods",
    "@xcite have demonstrated a polarization grating system that works from 3 to 20 microns , and showed that the retardance is only marginally impacted ( 3% ) at cryogenic temperatures . if necessary , such a change in retardance can be pre - compensated during manufacturing .",
    "instruments that would be suitable for a vapp coronagraph are adaptive optics - fed high - contrast cameras such as sphere - zimpol @xcite on the very large telescope , gpi on gemini south @xcite , expo on the william herschel telescope @xcite , and mmt - pol @xcite .",
    "these polarimetric instruments already contain the required wollaston prism ( or other polarizing beam - splitter ) to split the psfs .",
    "note that even in cases of moderate ( @xmath4550% ) strehl ratio , the vapp still delivers a average raw contrast of @xmath46 at 46 @xmath0 . the second vapp prototype ( cf .",
    "the design presented by @xcite ) has recently been integrated in lmircam on the large binocular telescope @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the vapp coronagraph naturally pairs with polarimetry it is possible to reach an even deeper contrast for scattered planet light by combining the two techniques @xcite .",
    "the two complementary images may also furnish focal - plane wavefront sensing cf .",
    "@xcite to provide information for real - time or post - factor correction of ( instrumental ) wavefront aberrations .",
    "finally , we must emphasize that the use of the achromatic patterning technique is not limited to phase manipulation in pupil - plane coronagraphs , but can also be used for focal - plane coronagraphs or a combination of both .",

    "a combination of intensity ratios gives us an equation with no dependency on the fast axis , input intensity or polarization , or the transmission : @xmath72 similarly , the equation @xmath73 gives us an expression that yields the retarder orientation ( i.e.  half the vector phase ) that is insensitive to the input intensity and polarization as long as they are constant during the exposures .",

    "we obtain additional constraints by repeating these measurements with an offset of 22.5 degrees . the intensity and corresponding reconstructed phases fold back at different locations in the images while the retardance remains the same as before .",
