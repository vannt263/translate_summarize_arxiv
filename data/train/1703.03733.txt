    "a combination of a 2d finite - volume plasma transport code with a kinetic monte - carlo model for neutral particles is typically applied for numerical modelling of the tokamak edge and divertor plasmas .",
    "a well known example of such modelling tool is the code package b2-eirene  @xcite ( solps ) widely used in the field .",
    "the monte - carlo method allows physically accurate description of atomic and molecular kinetics in complex geometries , but has a disadvantage of random error - statistical noise in the calculated quantity .",
    "there were always concerns that this statistical noise can have detrimental impact on the coupled solution  @xcite .    in the present paper one specific noise related issue which can lead to pathological solutions is addressed - violation of the global particle balance .",
    "it is shown that the error in the steady - state particle balance can be presented as a sum of three terms .",
    "those are operator splitting error , residual of the fluid solver , and the time - derivative .",
    "whereas the first term can be effectively reduced by the source re - scaling the reduction of residuals may require iterative solution of the discretized fluid equations after each call of the monte - carlo model .",
    "this can , in turn , pose severe restrictions on the time - step and lead to a very long overall run - time .",
    "e.g. in the iter modelling studies  @xcite one model run could take several months of wall - clock time .",
    "special diagnostics for monitoring of the particle balance allow to clearly identify the cases when reduction of residuals is absolutely necessary , and the corresponding measures must be taken .",
    "this paper presents in condensed form the most important findings from a dedicated studiy of the solps code  @xcite .",
    "prototypes of the numerical diagnostics were implemented and tested in the code solps4.3 which is the legacy version of b2-eirene used in the past for the iter design modelling  @xcite .",
    "the approach itself is thought to be applicable to any finite - volume edge code .",
    "the numerical convergence is analyzed here only in terms of the global balances and criteria of the ( quasi-)steady - state .",
    "it is not attempted to use the stricter methods of analysis proposed for the combination of fluid and monte - carlo models in  @xcite .",
    "only steady - state solutions are considered .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section a finite - volume fluid code with source terms calculated by monte - carlo",
    "is described in general terms . in section  [ diagnosticss ]",
    "the diagnostics for monitoring of the particle balance are introduced .",
    "an example of calculations with different error ( residual ) reduction techniques is discussed in section  [ examples ] .",
    "further methods which can be used to reduce the residuals and the associated error in the particle balance are outlined in section  [ reductions ] .",

    "e.g. for the particle continuity @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the time - step .",
    "the notation with tilde @xmath16 underlines that this source term is calculated by monte - carlo and contains random error , as opposite to the `` exact '' value @xmath8 which would be obtained with the infinite number of test particles .    in the code b2 the set of non - linear algebraic equations  ( [ timestepeq ] )",
    "is solved by simple iterations and block gauss - seidel algorithm ( splitting by equations ) .",
    "the so called `` internal iterations '' of b2 are described in detail in ref .  ,",

    "the source terms are calculated at the beginning of internal iterations and are fixed afterward .",

    "however , certain modifications of the sources can be made in the iterative solver to adjust them with the changed plasma solution @xmath17 .",
    "this modification is reflected in the notation as @xmath23 .",
    "critical importance of the very high accuracy in the global particle balances for the reactor - scale edge modelling was recognized back at the early stages of the iter analysis  @xcite . to reach this high accuracy",
    "the monte - carlo neutral transport code must ensure perfect particle conservation in its solution .",
    "the internal balance in the neutral solver is usually achieved by re - scaling of the volumetric ion sources estimated by the statistical procedure to make them entirely consistent with the primary sources of neutral particles . to increase accuracy the particles originating from the different primary sources @xmath24",
    "are sampled independently from each other - the source is split into independent `` strata '' .",
    "the primary sources of neutrals are : i ) recombination of ions on the solid surfaces - `` recycling '' ; ii ) volumetric recombination in the plasma ; iii ) gas puff ; iv ) erosion .",
    "the strength of recycling sources is proportional to the ion fluxes .",
    "if the volumetric ion sources @xmath22 stay fixed , but the fluxes of neutralized ( recycled ) ions change in the course of internal iterations , than an imbalance in the sinks and sources occurs . to compensate for this inconsistency the sources of ions@xmath4 coming from recycling strata @xmath24 : @xmath25 ,",
    "must be re - scaled as follows : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the index of internal iteration , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the total flux of neutralized ions to which the source @xmath30 is proportional .",
    "e.g. if @xmath4 is he@xmath31 then @xmath32 is the sum of the fluxes of he@xmath31 and he@xmath33 .",
    "numerical diagnostic for monitoring of the steady - state global particle balance can be derived from equation  ( [ internal_iterationeq ] ) by transforming it into the form : @xmath34 \\label{generalized_residualeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] error ( inconsistency ) of the global particle balance is defined separately for each ion species @xmath35 .",
    "`` ion species '' here is the chemical element as opposite to `` ion fluids '' which are charged states of an element .",
    "e.g. species carbon includes 6 ion fluids from c@xmath31 to c@xmath36 .",
    "equation  ( [ generalized_residualeq ] ) is applied to discretized continuity equation for each ion fluid @xmath4 in each cell @xmath37 .",
    "then the sum is calculated :    @xmath38    = \\sum_i \\sum_{\\alpha ' }   \\left [ - r^{\\alpha'}_i + \\tilde s^{\\alpha'}_i\\left(\\phi^m_k \\right ) -",

    "it is readily seen that zero left hand side of equation  ( [ particle_balanceeq ] ) means perfect balance between volumetric sources and fluxes , and the right hand side is the error in the global particle balance of species @xmath35 .    alternative way of writing the particle balance uses formulation via fluxes  @xcite : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the strength of external particle source - gas puff , @xmath43 is the ion flux through the core grid boundary , @xmath44 is the flux sputtered from the solid surfaces , @xmath45 is the flux ( of both ions and neutrals ) absorbed on solid surfaces - pumped flux , @xmath46 is the flux of atoms which leak to the core .",
    "the final steady - state solution has to self - adjust in such way that the rate with which the particles are removed from the system @xmath47 becomes equal to the particle input : @xmath48 that is , @xmath49 serves as a scale to which the particle balance error has to be compared .",
    "the numerical solution can be considered as physically meaningful only if this error @xmath50 .",

    "this is the error in the solution of the set of nonlinear finite - volume equations on each time - iteration .",
    "the term @xmath56 is due to inconsistency of the neutral - related sources calculated on the `` old '' and `` new '' plasma .",
    "it can be called an operator splitting error .",
    "this term can become large if , e.g. , the re - scaling procedure , equation  ( [ residualeq ] ) , is not implemented .",
    "last term @xmath57 is the time derivative which is considered as error when a stationary solution is looked for .",
    "if the plasma fluxes in equation  ( [ balance_fluxeseq ] ) are taken from the solution @xmath17 , and the neutral fluxes are calculated on the same plasma , then it is easy to show that equations  ( [ balance_fluxeseq ] ) and  ( [ balance_residualeq ] ) must yield exactly same result when one extra condition is fulfilled .",
    "this condition is the discrete analogue of the divergence theorem : @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the total flux of ions of species @xmath35 to the grid boundaries .",
    "the total ion source is calculated as the total source of neutral particles minus their pumped and leaked fluxes : @xmath60 volume recombination does not appear in equation  ( [ total_sourceeq ] ) because atoms originating from recombination which re - ionize back in plasma do not contribute to the net source , and particles which are removed from the system are already included in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . subtracting equation  ( [ total_fluxeq ] ) from equation  ( [ total_sourceeq ] ) yields the nominator of equation  ( [ balance_fluxeseq ] ) .    in practice",
    "it makes sense to use both diagnostics in parallel .",
    "incorrect particle balance in the solution for neutrals or a mistake in the transfer of ion fluxes to the monte - carlo code manifests itself as non - physical particle sinks or sources .",
    "the diagnostic of equation  ( [ balance_residualeq ] ) may not be able to detect them because it does not distinguish between `` legitimate '' and `` illegitimate '' sources and sinks of neutrals .",
    "this distinction is made in equation  ( [ balance_fluxeseq ] ) .",
    "the two diagnostics are complimentary to each other and enable an additional consistency check .",
    "an example discussed here is based on a solps4.3 run from the data - base of iter simulations  @xcite ( case # 1568vk4 , see ref .  , chapter 4.2 ) .",
    "the model plasma consists of all charged states of d , he and c. power entering the computational domain from the core is equal to @xmath63=80  mw , 47  % of @xmath63 is radiated , mainly by c ions .",
    "the d particle content is controlled by the gas puff @xmath64=1.17e22  d - at@xmath65s@xmath66 and ion flux from the core @xmath67=0.91e22  s@xmath66 .",

    "all plasma facing components in the model are assumed to be covered by carbon .",
    "the pump is modelled by an absorbing surface in divertor beneath the dome .",
    "the solution represents a relatively hot attached plasma in front of divertor targets , with insignificant parallel momentum losses and volume recombination .",

    "are used , the time - step is set to @xmath15=3e-7  sec .",
    "significant increase of the time - step is not possible : with @xmath691e-6  sec a numerical instability develops and no stationary solution can be found .",
    "it turns out that @xmath15 can be increased by orders of magnitude if no - internal iterations are applied , that is @xmath70 . in this case",
    "no visible instability develops even with @xmath15=1e-4  sec .",
    "however , solutions obtained with and without internal iterations - they are shown in figure  [ comparing_solutionsf ] - strongly deviate from each other .",
    "strictly - speaking , in the presence of monte - carlo noise in the source terms the solutions never reach true steady - state .",
    "one can only speak about quasi - steady - state solution which randomly oscillates around some average . as applied to",
    "the b2-eirene runs , the `` quasi - steady - state '' is defined through characteristic decay times of selected parameters derived from their time - traces , see appendix . in practice",
    "the run is regarded as converged if the condition of quasi - steady - state is fulfilled , and if errors in the global power and particle balances are small .",

    "a solution can be obtained which is correct in terms of the global balances .",
    "techniques , such as internal iterations in b2 , can impose severe limitation on the time - step , and it is not attractive from the run - time point of view to operate the code in this mode . experience has shown that the use of b2-eirene with @xmath18=1 does not always lead to deviations as large as that shown in figure  [ comparing_solutionsf ] .",
    "e.g. in iter cases with single fluid ( d only ) plasma @xmath74 was found to be sufficiently small both with and without internal iterations , and the obtained solutions are very close to each other , see example in ref .  ,",
    "chapter 4.1 .",
    "the multi - fluid simulation analyzed here clearly demonstrates that this must not always be the case .",
    "the example emphasizes that in each simulation the particle balance has to be carefully monitored with the special diagnostics .",
    "too large error detected by the diagnostic is an unequivocal indication that the residual reduction techniques must be applied irrespective of the run - time penalty which they impose .",
    "a series of studies have been undertaken with the b2-eirene code to find algorithms which would deliver sufficiently good accuracy without penalizing the run - time .",
    "their outcome may be of general interest for developers and users of other edge modelling codes as well .",
    "main results are briefly summarized in this section .    as a simplest remedy to the particle balance problem a `` 0d correction ''",
    "was first tried , see ref .  , chapter 5.5 . the ion density in the whole computational domain",
    "is multiplied by a constant factor calculated in such way that with the corrected ion fluxes @xmath90 automatically becomes zero .",
    "it was found that this method can not be applied because it always produces solutions oscillating in time , and no stationary solutions .",
    "much more success was achieved with a correction based on iterative relaxation of the finite - volume continuity equations .",
    "technical details of the implementation in b2 can be found in ref .  ,",
    "chapter 5.2 - 5.4 .",
    "this algorithm works as follows .",
    "the whole set of equations for particle , momentum and energy balances is relaxed only on the first internal iteration . on subsequent iterations only equations for particle continuity are relaxed . to be precise ,",
    "in the code b2 those are pressure correction equations where both the density and velocity fields are modified .",
    "( b2 uses compressible version of the patankar s simple algorithm , see ref .  , chapter 6.7 and ref .  , chapter 3 . ) nevertheless , correction of the particle balance via relaxation of the pressure correction equations was found to be very reliable .",
    "tests performed for the same iter model as in section  [ examples ] showed that such iterations robustly converge with time - steps up to @xmath15=1e-4  sec .",
    "results obtained with this algorithm can be found in the last row in tables  [ particle_energy_balancet ] and  [ particle_balancet ] .",
    "the run was performed with 99 iterations for continuity equations after one full internal iteration , which is reflected in the designation @xmath18=1 + 99 . despite",
    "increased @xmath94 the method leads to significant reduction of the total error @xmath95 due to reduction of @xmath81 .",
    "as expected , the main disadvantage of this procedure is that it increases residuals of other equations .",
    "closer investigations ( ref .  , chapter 6.1 ) have shown that especially the parallel momentum balance suffers .",
    "however , comparison of the solutions obtained with full internal iterations and with the reduced scheme demonstrates that they are close to each other : the @xmath18=1 + 99 case is shown by dashed line in figure  [ comparing_solutionsf ] .",
    "moreover , tests have shown that this result holds even for the iter model with high density detached divertor , see ref .  , chapter 6.4 .",
    "hence , the method can be suggested for use in a two stage approach for fast finding of the initial approximation to the solution which is then refined on the second `` slow '' stage by more accurate techniques .    as a next step",
    "a scheme was proposed where coupled continuity and parallel momentum balance equations are iterated - without equations for temperatures .",
    "this kind of `` incomplete internal iterations '' was implemented in b2-eirene and tested as well , but the results were found to be unsatisfactory : ref .  , chapter 2.3 .",
    "tests have shown that similar to the full internal iterations the `` incomplete iterations '' are prone to numerical instabilities at large time - steps , and therefore bring no advantages .",
    "the simple pressure correction which introduces extra non - linearity is a possible reason of this behavior .",
    "the scheme could be improved if monolithic coupling of the continuity and momentum equation would be applied instead .",
    "that is , when corrections for both the density and the velocity fields are calculated simultaneously in a one set of linear equations .",
    "a fairly simple technique which increases accuracy and can be easily implemented in any code is time - averaging of the source terms , ref .  ,",
    "chapter 3 .",
    "although this algorithm can be helpful in many cases , it was found to be not always efficient enought in reducing @xmath72 , in particular with impurities , see example in ref .  , chapter 4.2 . in",
    "@xcite a more advanced",
    " piling method \" is described which do not reset the whole history as the calculation of the new average starts .",
    "finally , the brute force method can always be applied to decrease both the statistical error in the source terms and the residuals - massive increase of the number of test particles .",
    "applicability of this solution strongly depends on the available computing hardware .",
    "the test particle monte - carlo algorithm is easy to parallelize , and the increased number of particles does not necessarily mean the increased wall - clock run time .",
    "experience  @xcite has indicated that the pure `` brute force compensation '' of the particle balance issue described in section  [ examples ] is likely to require @xmath96100 processors to be practical .",
    "use of the test particle monte - carlo for neutrals in the tokamak edge modelling codes has an unpleasant side effect of random error in the source terms .",
    "if no special measures are taken , then this persistent statistical noise leads to residuals of the discretized fluid equations which do not converge , but saturate at a certain level . in the present paper one particular well identified issue caused by the saturated residuals has been described .",
    "it has been shown that too large finite - volume residuals can cause crude violation of the global particle balance . in turn , for the system in question - the tokamak edge and divertor plasma - violation of the particle conservation may have a very strong ( `` zero order '' ) non - local impact on the whole numerical solution .",
    "there are computational techniques which can effectively reduce the residuals .",
    "e.g. in the code b2 which uses splitting by equations an extra loop of simple iterations on each time - iteration is applied . however ,",
    "severe restriction imposed by those internal iterations on the time - step leads to a very long overall model run - time when this option is used . with numerical diagnostics proposed in this work",
    "it can be unambiguously identified when the too large error in the particle balance is caused by the saturated residuals , and the residual reduction techniques must be applied to obtain the physically meaningful solution .",
    "the diagnostics can be implemented in any finite - volume edge code .",
    "the problem describe here would become less of an issue if solving the set of non - linear equations on each time - iteration would not require reduced time - step . if such solvers are not feasible , then the accuracy and run - time drawbacks may even outweight the very advantage of using the kinetic test particle monte - carlo in the self - consistent models .",
    "the drawbacks can be partly compensated by reducing the statistical error which is , in principle , only a matter of available computing resources .",
    "emerging heterogeneous cpu - booster architectures could be particularly well suited for the combination of a fluid and a monte - carlo code .",
    "while the serial finite - volume part runs on cpu , the monte - carlo part can make use of massive parallelization on hundreds of processing units on the accelerator .",
