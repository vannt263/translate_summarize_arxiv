    "modern cosmology not only studies the background dynamics of any inflationary model of the universe , but also the perturbation dynamics via the connected @xmath8-point correlators @xmath9 of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath3 @xcite . during some time , the two - point correlator of @xmath3 was enough for the purpose of comparing theoretical predictions with observation , but , after satellite missions reached amazing accuracy levels @xcite ( see for example the recent results by planck @xcite ) , it has been necessary to work out the connected three- and four - point correlators of @xmath3 .",
    "non - vanishing connected three- or four - point correlators of @xmath3 imply that the probability distribution function of the primordial curvature perturbation is non - gaussian @xcite , that being the reason why the functions @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that parameterize the connected three- and four - point correlators of @xmath3 respectively are called the levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "a few years ago , suyama and yamaguchi @xcite showed that @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfy the following consistency relation : @xmath13 as long as the following conditions are satisfied :    * _ condition 1 _ : the calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is performed at tree level in the diagrammatic approach of the @xmath6 formalism @xcite . *",
    "_ condition 2 _ : the inflationary dynamics is driven by any number of slowly - rolling scalar fields . * _ condition 3 _ : the fields involved are gaussian . *",
    "_ condition 4 _ : the field perturbations are scale - invariant .",
    "although @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not directly comparable in the general case because they are functions of the wavevectors , the latter expression is valid since , under the conditions previously stated , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "we will call eq .",
    "( [ sye ] ) the first variety of the suyama - yamaguchi ( sy ) consistency relation .    because of the role of the sy consistency relation of eq .",
    "( [ sye ] ) at ruling out classes of cosmological inflationary models in the event that the inequality is observationally violated , it is reasonable to wonder if it is possible to relax some or all the conditions previously stated while preserving the sy consistency relation .",
    "suyama , takahashi , yamaguchi , and yokoyama @xcite , and sugiyama , komatsu , and futamase @xcite , made efforts in this direction , trying to take into account the one - loop corrections to the three- and four - point correlation functions ( relaxing condition 1 ) , but adding a new condition :    * _ condition 5 _ : @xmath10 is evaluated in the squeezed limit ( @xmath14 ) while @xmath11 is evaluated in the collapsed limit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this effort was consolidated by sugiyama @xcite who demonstrated that the sy consistency relation is valid if conditions 2 - 5 are met and condition 1 is replaced by the following one :    * _ condition 1 _ : the calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is performed at all loop corrections in the diagrammatic approach of the @xmath6 formalism @xcite .",
    "however , in an elegant work by smith , loverde , and zaldarriaga @xcite , it was shown that the first variety of the sy consistency relation is valid if condition 5 is met while conditions 1 - 4 are replaced by the following ones :    * _ condition 1 _ : the calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is performed non - perturbatively . * _ condition 2 _ : the inflationary dynamics is arbitrary .",
    "* _ condition 2a ( actually , a consequence of condition 2 ) _ : the fields involved ( if any ) can be non - gaussian . * _ condition 3 _ : statistical homogeneity of @xmath3 is preserved . * _ condition 4 _ : statistical isotropy of @xmath3 is preserved .    the statistical homogeneity of @xmath3 states that the connected @xmath8-point correlators in the configuration space are invariant under space translations @xcite",
    "; this implies that , in the momentum space , the connected @xmath8-point correlators are proportional to a dirac delta function : @xmath16 the above implies that the wavevector configuration is such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... , and @xmath19 form a warped polygon .",
    "the statistical homogeneity is fundamental in cosmology since it allows us to compare theoretical predictions with observations ( via the ergodic theorem , see refs .",
    "in contrast , the statistical isotropy of @xmath3 states that the connected @xmath8-point correlators in the configuration space are invariant under space rotations @xcite ; this implies that , in the momentum space , and once statistical homogeneity has been imposed , each connected @xmath8-point correlator is proportional to a function @xmath20 called the @xmath21-spectrum which is invariant under rotations in the momentum space : @xmath22 where @xmath23 being @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the rotation operator such that @xmath26 in the configuration space , i.e. the @xmath21-spectrum is the same no matter the orientation of the warped polygon .",
    "the statistical isotropy is the usual assumption in cosmology since the inflationary dynamics is usually driven by scalar fields only , which , due to its nature , do not exhibit preferred directions .",
    "some time after the work by smith , loverde , and zaldarriaga , and by employing an alternative technique , assassi , baumann , and green @xcite obtained the same result as the former ones under the same assumptions .",
    "however , both proofs rely on this additional assumption :    * _ condition 6 _ : @xmath1 and @xmath2 are scale - invariant ,    as clearly stated in a later work by kehagias and riotto @xcite . the latter authors come back to the original conditions 1 and 5 , except for condition 2 which is reinforced and conditions 3 and 4 which are relaxed :    * _ condition 2 _ : the inflationary dynamics is driven by any number of slowly - rolling lorentz - invariant scalar fields . * _ condition 3 _ : the fields involved can be non - gaussian . * _ condition 4 _ : the field perturbations , in principle , might not be scale - invariant .    by paying attention to the symmetries present during the de sitter epoch , and employing the operator product expansion technique , kehagias and riotto",
    "show that the connected two- , three- , and four - point correlators of the field perturbations are scale - invariant in the squeezed ( for the three - point correlators ) and collapsed ( for the four - point correlators ) limits .",
    "thus , the first variety of the sy consistency relation , under the conditions just stated above , is shown to be valid but just at tree level in the diagrammatic approach to the @xmath6 formalism .",
    "kehagias and riotto assume that their proof is valid , even including loop corrections , for a wide range of models since loop corrections seem to become important just for rather marginal cases @xcite ( see however @xcite ) ; nevertheless , their proof at all loop corrections , employing the results by sugiyama @xcite , is still incomplete as long as the connected @xmath8-point correlators in the field perturbations , with @xmath27 , are not shown to be scale - invariant in the required limits .",
    "the proofs by smith , loverde , and zaldarriaga @xcite , and by assassi , baumann , and green @xcite , are by far the most general and lead us to wonder whether one or some of the conditions these proofs are based on are unnecessary ; they also lead us to state , assuming that the proof in @xcite is valid at all orders , that a violation of the first variety of the sy consistency relation would imply that new non - trivial degrees of freedom play a role during inflation . among the conditions that could be unnecessary",
    ", we think that the statistical isotropy condition , and the scale - invariance condition for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are the ones to investigate since the statistical homogeneity condition is essential to compare theory with observation @xcite and since the other three conditions are absolutely general . among the possible new non - trivial degrees of freedom ,",
    "the vector fields are particularly interesting since they are suitable candidates to explain the apparent violation of statistical isotropy observed in the 5-year data from the wmap satellite @xcite and the anomalies at low multipoles confirmed by the 1-year data from the planck satellite @xcite , given that they define inherently a preferred direction for the expansion , for the distribution of primordial fluctuations , or for both @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the vector fields , the statistical anisotropy , and the scale - dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeed related to each other since , even in the simplest case when the expansion is isotropic , vector fields break the statistical isotropy in @xmath3 @xcite , and can make @xmath1 and @xmath2 strongly scale - dependent at tree level @xcite and even more at higher levels in the perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "several interesting works have recently studied this relation between non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy in different models , see for instance refs . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this section , we are going to reproduce the proof by smith , loverde , and zaldarriaga @xcite , step by step , but this time relaxing the statistical isotropy condition . as discussed around eq .",
    "( [ spectra ] ) , after imposing statistical homogeneity , the connected @xmath8-point correlator of @xmath3 is written in terms of a function @xmath28 , called the @xmath21-spectrum , which , if statistical isotropy is imposed , becomes invariant under spatial rotations of its arguments ; this in turn implies that the spectrum @xmath29 and bispectrum @xmath30 depend in this case only on the magnitudes of the wavevectors involved ( i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) while the trispectrum @xmath33 and so on still depend on the whole wavevectors .",
    "when relaxing the statistical isotropy condition , we must take into account that @xmath29 and @xmath30 do depend on the whole wavevectors and so does @xmath10 ( as well as @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ; however , by virtue of the reality condition on @xmath3 , the relation @xmath34 is met @xcite . from now on , by virtue of the statistical homogeneity condition , we will call @xmath29 just as @xmath35 .",

    "( [ syvf ] ) is valid since , under the conditions just stated above , @xmath129 and @xmath128 are scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "when first introduced back in 2008 @xcite , the sy consistency relation was considered as a useful tool to discriminate among different classes of models for the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation ; however , the quite strong conditions under which this relation was proven led to several authors to wonder whether such conditions could be relaxed in the search of a more accurate and clean way to employ this consistency relation as a discriminator tool . since that time , six different varieties of the sy consistency relation have been implicitly introduced in the literature , one of them indeed introduced in the present paper . in this work ,",
    "we have collected the six varieties and showed them explicitly as well as the conditions under which they are valid .",
    "the first and the sixth varieties , eqs .",
    "( [ sye ] ) and ( [ syvf ] ) , are quite similar in the sense that the non - gaussianity parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are scale - invariant ; they are different in the sense that the first variety involves the whole @xmath1 and @xmath2 while the sixth variety involves only their isotropic pieces . the second and third varieties of the sy consistency relation , eqs .",
    "( [ slzconsistency ] ) and ( [ abgconsistency ] ) , are very similar since they involve an integration over the momentum space but are different because the integration in the second variety is just in a narrow band of wavevectors whereas in the third variety the integration is over the entire momentum space while introducing the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation as part of the integrand ; anyway , because of the integrations , it looks quite difficult to employ these varieties of the sy consistency relation in order to discriminate among different classes of models .",
    "what is interesting however of these varieties is that they are valid even if there is neither statistical isotropy nor scale - invariance : that is why the fourth variety in eq . ( [ mpsy ] ) is so interesting , being just the straightforward generalization of the first variety and whose form is easily inspired from the second and third varieties ; it is for sure valid for models involving only slowly - rolling lorentz - invariant scalar fields , as long as the proof by kehagias and riotto @xcite turns out to be valid at all orders in perturbation theory , but for sure fails in some model that involves non - trivial degrees of freedom ; indeed , we have shown in section [ fourth ] the first counterexample : the fourth variety is strongly violated in a quite generic class of models that involves vector fields and that include the vector curvaton model proposed by dimopoulos @xcite-@xcite , the vector inflation model proposed by golovenev , mukhanov , and vanchurin @xcite , and the hybrid inflation model with coupled vector and scalar `` waterfall field '' where @xmath3 is generated at the end of inflation proposed by yokoyama and soda @xcite ( see also an interesting critical discussion about this work in @xcite ) .",
    "the latter results sounds ubiquitous for any variety of the sy consistency relation , that does not involve integrations over momentum space , when there is no scale - invariance ; nonetheless , we have been able to introduce the fifth variety of the sy consistency relation in eq .",
    "( [ 5vsy ] ) whose validity is only restricted to the existence of statistical homogeneity and when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are calculated in the squeezed and collapsed limits respectively ; indeed , this variety stands the test of the class of models described above as shown in section [ fourth ] ; perhaps the strongest conclusion we can extract from all this analysis is a simple question : what will we do if the fifth variety of the sy consistency relation is observationally violated ?",
    "it would imply statistical inhomogeneity , which in turn implies that , although we dispose of very good data and very good theory , we can not compare them to each other @xcite : this situation would be a real shake in the foundations of cosmology as a science @xcite .",

    "<S> we present the different consistency relations that can be seen as variations of the well known suyama - yamaguchi ( sy ) consistency relation @xmath0 , the latter involving the levels of non - gaussianity @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been ( implicitly ) claimed that the following variation : @xmath4 , which we call `` the fourth variety '' , in the collapsed ( for @xmath2 ) and squeezed ( for @xmath1 ) limits is always satisfied independently of any physics ; however , the proof depends sensitively on the assumption of scale - invariance ( expressing this way the fourth variety of the sy consistency relation as @xmath0 ) which only applies for cosmological models involving lorentz - invariant scalar fields ( at least at tree level ) , leaving room for a strong violation of this variety of the consistency relation when non - trivial degrees of freedom , for instance vector fields , are in charge of the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation . with this in mind as a motivation , we explicitly state , in the first part of this work , under which conditions the sy consistency relation has been claimed to hold in its different varieties ( implicitly ) presented in the literature since its inception back in 2008 ; as a result , we show for the first time that the variety @xmath5 , which we call `` the fifth variety '' , is always satisfied even when there is strong scale - dependence and high levels of statistical anisotropy as long as statistical homogeneity holds : thus , an observed violation of this specific variety would prevent the comparison between theory and observation , shaking this way the foundations of cosmology as a science . in the second part , we concern about the existence of non - trivial degrees of freedom , concretely vector fields for which the levels of non - gaussianity have been calculated for very few models ; among them , and by making use of the @xmath6 formalism at tree level , we study a class of models that includes the vector curvaton scenario , vector inflation , and the hybrid inflation with coupled vector and scalar `` waterfall field '' where @xmath3 is generated at the end of inflation , finding that the fourth variety of the sy consistency relation is indeed strongly violated for some specific wavevector configurations while the fifth variety continues to be well satisfied . finally , as a byproduct of our investigation , we draw attention to a quite recently demonstrated variety of the sy consistency relation : @xmath7 , in scenarios where scalar and vector fields contribute to the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation ; this variety of the sy consistency relation is satisfied although the isotropic pieces of the non - gaussianity parameters receive contributions from the vector fields . </S>",
