    "as early as 1985 , bhalerao and liu  @xcite performed a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 reactions in the close - to - threshold region , and discovered that the interaction between the nucleon and the @xmath0 meson is attractive .",
    "this finding inspired haider and liu to postulate the existence of @xmath0-mesic nuclei  @xcite , in which the neutral @xmath0 meson might be bound with nucleons via the strong interaction .",
    "the existence of @xmath0-mesic bound states would allow to investigate the interaction of the @xmath0 meson and nucleons inside a nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , it would provide information about the @xmath9 resonance  @xcite and about the @xmath0 meson properties in a nuclear matter  @xcite , as well as about contribution of the flavour singlet component of the quark - gluon wave function of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite . according to theoretical considerations",
    ", the formation of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus can only take place if the real part of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering length is negative ( attractive nature of the interaction ) , and the magnitude of the real part is greater than the magnitude of the imaginary part  @xcite :    @xmath10     + a wide range of possible values of the s - wave @xmath0n scattering length , from @xmath11=(0.27 + 0.22i ) fm up to @xmath11=(1.05 + 0.27i ) fm , calculated for hadronic- and photoproduction of the @xmath0 meson has not excluded the formation of @xmath0-nucleus bound states for a light nuclei as @xmath12 , t  @xcite and even for deuteron  @xcite .",
    "those bound states have been searched for in many experiments  @xcite , however none of them gave empirical confirmation of their existence .",
    "there are only a promising experimental observations which might be interpreted as   of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "for example , experimental observations which might suggest the possibility of  the existence of the @xmath13-@xmath0 bound system were found by  @xcite ,  @xcite , anke  @xcite and  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the data analysis of the close to threshold spes-4 and spes-2 measurements of the total cross led to the determination of the  @xmath14 scattering length which , within the experimental errors , fulfill the condition given by eq .  [ eq : eq1 ] . in the experiments conducted at the cosy",
    "synchrotron the momentum ramping technique of the deuteron beam was used that allows to reduce the systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the beam was accelerated slowly and linearly in  time , from excess energy of   up  to in  case  of  the anke experiment  @xcite , while during the experiment  @xcite the  momentum was varied in the range corresponding to the excess energy from to .",
    "both collaborations performed the measurement of  the  excitation function and differential cross section of  the reaction close to the  kinematical threshold .",
    "data taken by the cosy-11 group were used to search for a signal of a @xmath13-@xmath0 bound state below the @xmath0 production threshold of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 reactions  @xcite , while the measurements above the threshold enabled the study of the forward - backward asymmetries of the differential cross sections and the extraction of the @xmath0-@xmath13 scattering length .",
    "the data of both groups  @xcite show a variation in the phase of the s - wave amplitude in the near - threshold region , consistent with possible existence of a bound state  @xcite .",
    "the first direct experimental indications of light @xmath0-nucleus bound states were observed in @xmath0 photoproduction @xmath18@xmath19 which was carried out by the taps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the  measurements of  the excitation functions for two ranges of  the  relative angle between @xmath20 and proton were carried  out .",
    "it appeared that a  difference between those excitation curves in  the  center - of - mass frame revealed an  enhancement just below the threshold of the @xmath21 @xmath13-@xmath0 reaction which was interpreted as a  possible signature of a  @xmath13-@xmath0 bound state where @xmath0 meson captured by one of  nucleons inside helium forms an intermediate @xmath22 resonance which decays into @xmath20-@xmath23 pair .",
    "however , it was shown later that the result may be an artefact due to the strong influence of the resonances on the shape of the excitation function  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a new high - statictics exclusive measurement is necessary .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1-@xmath0 bound states is performed with high precision at the cosy accelerator with the wasa detection system .",
    "signatures of the nuclei are searched for in the excitation function of specific decay channels of the system , formed in deuteron - deuteron collision  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0 meson can be absorbed by one of the nucleons inside the helium and may propagate in the nucleus via consecutive excitation of nucleons to the @xmath25 state  @xcite until the resonance decays into a pion - proton pair emitted by the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the relative angle between p and @xmath26 is equal to @xmath27 in the @xmath28 reference frame and it is smeared by about @xmath29 in the center - of - mass frame due to the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the helium nucleus .",
