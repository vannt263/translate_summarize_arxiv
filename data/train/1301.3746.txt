    "in fact , it was shown recently that the open subgroups correspond to _ semicoverings _ @xcite and that they correspond to classical coverings if and only if they contain an open normal subgroup @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    ", we present a more extreme example : an open subgroup @xmath13 of @xmath3 which does not contain _ any _ nontrivial normal subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "we find this subgroup by directly constructing a corresponding semicovering @xmath14 .    in the last section",
    ", we briefly sketch a unified proof of both abovementioned correspondence results of @xcite and @xcite for connected and locally path - connected spaces ( corollaries  [ b ] and [ t ] below , respectively ) from the common perspective of the further generalized covering spaces of @xcite .",
