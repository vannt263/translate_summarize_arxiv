    "<S> time evolution of wave packets built from the eigenstates of the dirac equation for a hydrogenic system is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the space and spin motion of wave packets which , in the non - relativistic limit , are stationary states with a probability density distributed uniformly along the classical , elliptical orbit ( elliptic wp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the precession of such a wp , due to relativistic corrections to the energy eigenvalues , is strongly correlated with the spin motion . </S>",
    "<S> we show also that the motion is universal for all hydrogenic systems with an arbitrary value of the atomic number @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the detailed study of the time evolution of quantum wave packets ( wps ) in simple atomic or molecular systems has been the object of growing attention for more than ten years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the previous theoretical studies were done in non - relativistic framework . in the field of relativistic quantum mechanics most of the efforts </S>",
    "<S> have been focused on the problem of the interaction between the atoms and a mixture of static fields with , most of the time , intense laser fields @xcite . under these conditions the use of a relativistic theory is fully justified since the external field is then able to bring considerable energy to the wp . for isolated atoms , however , the use of relativistic dynamics is more questionable , if the wp is followed or observed only during a short period of time . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite relativistic wave packets , corresponding to circular orbits , have been constructed for hydrogenic atoms with a large @xmath0 , and propagated over time according to the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention was paid to the spin collapse event , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ to the maximum entanglement , in the course of time , of the spin degree of freedom with the spatial ones . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was first shown to take place for a wp in a harmonic oscillator with a spin - orbit force @xcite , where it is periodic . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason it has been called the _ spin - orbit pendulum_. in the dirac equation with a coulomb potential , it is produced by the built - in spin - orbit force and it is not periodic . the time scale where this effect can manifest itself </S>",
    "<S> was discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as a function of the charge @xmath0 of the atom and the average principal quantum number @xmath1 of the wp . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is expected to take place on a longer time scale like the other time dependent quantum effects of spreading and of fractional revivals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we intend below to complement this work by studying the possible relativistic precession of elliptic wps and by comparing this precession to the spin motion . a preliminary version of the present work was already presented at the ecamp vii conference @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible ways to build up a wp on top of a classical elliptic orbit in non - relativistic mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is by kicking properly a well designed wp , for example a gaussian wp , that is then evolved in time by the free hamiltonian until it spreads above an average classical ellipsis . </S>",
    "<S> this method is not very easy to apply and its main inconvenience is to produce an internal motion within the ellipsis that is able to blur the precession . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have preferred a second method , much simpler and even more elegant , which consists of using the coherent wps of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are stationary states of the non - relativistic coulomb problem . </S>",
    "<S> the space probability density of these states was indeed shown to be highly concentrated around a classical bohr - sommerfeld ellipsis . if these states can be adapted to relativistic dynamics their time evolution will doubtlessly be due to relativistic effects , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ due to the fine structure that will act as a perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> let us first show how to adapt these states to a relativistic theory . </S>",

    "<S> the sum contains @xmath9 values of @xmath10 with @xmath11 even . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of states with @xmath12 decreases very rapidly with @xmath10 ( more than one order of magnitude for each 2 units of @xmath10 as shown in fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant weights are those with @xmath13 and their distribution is nearly gaussian . the relative contribution of states with @xmath12 increases , however , for larger values of the eccentricity parameter @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger admixture of these states causes much faster daphasing of the wp . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for illustration of typical precession phenomena he have chosen the case @xmath15 .    in order to study the entanglement of the spin degrees of freedom with the orbital ones , it is natural in a non - relativistic theory to start from a product state of an arbitrary spinor @xmath16 with the state @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> the wp gets small components in the most natural way . </S>",
    "<S> the radial parts of the large and of the small components are taken obviously as different ones . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density of the relativistic wp built in this way is represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the wp is produced by introducing the phase factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 as coefficients of states with @xmath29 and @xmath30 with their corresponding eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> the four components @xmath31 @xmath32 of the wp at time @xmath33 are given in the [ aa ] with @xmath25 defined as @xmath34    it should be stressed that @xmath25 for @xmath35 is not any more a product state of the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e3 ] ) due to the built - in entanglement contained in the solutions of the dirac equation </S>",
    "<S> . however , since the small components of @xmath25 are indeed very small , this defect has no important effect on the magnitude of the initial spin . since the spin - orbit coupling effect , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  spin - orbit pendulum @xcite , manifests itself more efficiently if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are perpendicular to each other , we choose for our discussion : @xmath38    precession of quantum elliptical states in the coulomb field has already been considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , starting also from the same coherent state as done here . </S>",
    "<S> however , the precession was studied only in non - relativistic quantum dynamics as a perturbation effect and no treatment of the spin was attempted .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally discuss the time units relevant to our problem . to the lowest order in terms of the fine structure constant , </S>",
    "<S> the energy of an eigenstate @xmath39 of the dirac equation can be written ( in a.u . ) for a hydrogenic atom of charge @xmath0 as @xmath40 with @xmath22 or @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant energy @xmath41 produces no effect on wp , since it depends only on @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> let us define an average time unit @xmath42 ( @xmath43 for precession ) : @xmath44 brackets @xmath45 in ( [ e9])-([e10 ] ) denote average values , @xmath46 is given by ( [ e2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath47 , @xmath15 precession time @xmath42 ranges from @xmath48s for @xmath49 to @xmath50s for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 in ( [ e10a ] ) denotes the kepler period .    </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to compare @xmath42 to the radiative lifetime @xmath53 of hydrogenic levels . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the estimation of @xmath53 for a single @xmath54 state given in @xcite . in atomic units </S>",
    "<S> it is @xmath55 which was found to agree within 10% with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the universal ratio : @xmath56 which guarantees that the precession of the wave packet takes place long enough time before even a single photon is emitted . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of @xmath57 in this ratio is understandable , since @xmath42 is a classical - like quantity , while @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath58 , because it can be expressed as a ratio of a typical energy of the emitted photon to the classical radiation rate corresponding to the orbital motion .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath59 the linear terms in the expansion of @xmath60 in the power of @xmath37 contribute on the average to @xmath61 in the exponential factors and the wp is expected to restore . </S>",
    "<S> however the terms of the higher order dephase differently the various partial waves , and this leads to a spreading of the wp near the initial shape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see the discussion on the magnitude of these terms in [ ab ] . </S>",
    "<S> expression ( 10 ) or ( 11 ) ( with the kepler period @xmath62 ) is also recognized as the classical precession time in the relativistic coulomb problem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that @xmath63 is also ( to the first order ) the energy difference between two spin - orbit partners . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the precession time can also be interpreted as the recurrence time of the spin . </S>",
    "<S> hence we should observe a strong correlation between the spatial motion of the density : the precession , and the spin motion .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss now the dynamics dependence on the atomic number , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> formula ( [ e10 ] ) suggests that the relativistic effects under consideration in this article , depend crucially on @xmath0 . for </S>",
    "<S> sure the highest possible @xmath0 are indeed required to lower @xmath42 as much as possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to stress nevertheless , that within a very good approximation , a scaling of @xmath0 is possible which leads to the universal behaviour of the wave packet ( [ e1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all since @xmath64 , approximated by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e8 ] ) , scales as @xmath65 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ as @xmath66 , the variable @xmath0 disappears from @xmath67 if we use the reduced time @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the autocorrelation function ( [ ac ] ) which is expressed only in terms of @xmath67 is the simplest quantity which has a universal behaviour , provided the same @xmath7 and @xmath14 are used for all values of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the other quantities , like the probability density and the the spin expectation values depend on the radial wave functions and radial integrals . in a non - relativistic theory scaling of the radial wave function is elementary , it is obtained by dividing the radial wave fuction by @xmath69 and multiplying the radial variable by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an exact property . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio small / large components of the relativistic solutions scale as @xmath70 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  roughly like @xmath71 and the radial wave functions depend also in a more complicated manner on @xmath0 . nevertheless , on the whole as seen in fig .  5 below </S>",
    "<S> , the small components contribute a very small part of the probability density even for @xmath49 ( see also fig .  1 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the probability density is therefore entirely governed by the large components _ i.e. _ by the non - relativistic theory .    in a similar way we have checked that the radial integrals which contribute to the spin expectation values have the same properties : the integrals @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are equal to 1 , within less than 10@xmath74 and the other @xmath75 contribute in a very small manner , also of the order of 10@xmath74 .    therefore , the universal behaviour of the wave packet is justified and except for fig .  2 no value of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is given . </S>",
    "<S> for longer times , the energy factors omitted in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e8 ] ) which involve higher powers of @xmath0 , play a role and produce a genuine @xmath0 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> those effects will not be discussed here .    the probability density of the wave packet with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> is shown for a set of times up to @xmath59 in fig .  3 and fig .  4 . </S>",
    "<S> the part of the density coming from the small components , shown in fig .  5 , is also concentrated on top of an ellipsis but its magnitude is a thousands times smaller than the total density . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath78 the density precesses as described classically with a small dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> however the spreading takes place very rapidly for larger @xmath33 and is quite extended for @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> the precession of the ellipsis , the recurrence and spreading can be seen in a more condensed manner in the autocorrelation function represented in fig .  6 for three different spin preparations ( spin up , spin down and @xmath77 ) . for small @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> the wp becomes almost orthogonal to its initial parent , for @xmath59 a recurrence occurs but the overlap is only 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> another peak occurs at @xmath79 but higher frequencies become important and spread the recurrence . for @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> these higher frequencies play a dominant role . </S>",
    "<S> an example of an approximate revival for @xmath81 is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 7 . </S>",
    "<S> fractional revivals @xcite can also be seen to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> two examples of 1/3 and 1/2 revivals are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the rough independence of the autocorrelation function on the spin preparation requires some explanation . </S>",
    "<S> we can approximate this function by @xmath82 where we have neglected the terms with very small weights @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the two sums above is almost the same because @xmath84 has a smooth variation with @xmath37 on the one hand , and because of the exact equality @xmath85 on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> finally the time evolution of the spin averages is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 9 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure exhibits what we can call the relativistic spin - orbit pendulum . </S>",
    "<S> although the wave packet is not prepared initially in a pure state of spin , the impurity is very small ( for @xmath77 one has @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as time goes on the spin stays very nearly in the @xmath87 plane and rotates around @xmath88 with period @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> its magnitude slowly decreases , however , and for @xmath89 the spin is amost totally entangled with the orbital motion , since the average of its three projections are almost zero . during a period of time that last for about @xmath90 the angular momentum of the spin </S>",
    "<S> is transferred to the orbital motion and therefore the mean trajectory is not planar anymore @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the orbital angular momentum of @xmath91 is much higher than @xmath92 this geometrical effect can hardly be represented graphically . from @xmath93 </S>",
    "<S> a revival of spin occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the spin rotates and increases its magnitude at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> this event stays even longer than initially . </S>",
    "<S> however the recurrence is only partial .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we can say , that for not too long time , the precession and spin motion of the wps are fairly well described by the following approximation : non - relativistic wave functions of the form ( [ e3 ] ) and relativistic energy eigenvalues . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> the full , computationally very demanding , relativistic approach is unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , this conclusion may be formulated not a priori but only a posteriori .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress the richness of the dynamics just described . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in addition to the relativistic precession of the ellipsis we have obtained for longer times its fractional revivals . during the evolution the spin of the electron is entangled with its orbital motion to various degrees . </S>",
    "<S> all this agree completely with previous results @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was obtained here in a full relativistic calculation . since we have been able to scale the atomic number @xmath0 we have given a universal behaviour to our wp . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , clear that this scaling is destroyed in real atoms in a more realistic theory which would take into account quantum defects . </S>",
    "<S> their inclusion would also distort the dynamics , for example it would change the precession time , in a way that is out of reach of our simple theory . </S>",
    "<S> as far as purely relativistic effects are concerned , like the importance of the small components or the zitterbewegung , we have found them negligible in the coulomb problem , in contrast to the dirac oscillator @xcite in which they play a major role .    </S>",
