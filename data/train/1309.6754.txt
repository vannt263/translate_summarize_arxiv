    "<S> we present results of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements on the `` kondo insulator '' smb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of surface areas investigated was reconstructed but , infrequently , also patches of varying size of non - reconstructed , sm- or b - terminated surfaces were found . on the smallest patches , clear indications for the hybridization gap and inter - multiplet transitions were observed . on non - reconstructed surface areas </S>",
    "<S> large enough for coherent co - tunneling we were able to observe clear - cut fano resonances . </S>",
    "<S> our locally resolved sts indicated considerable finite conductance on all surfaces independent of their structure .    </S>",
    "<S> materials with strong electron correlations continue to draw enormous attention not only because they may give rise to fundamentally new states of matter or new phenomena but also due to the hope for advanced technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> heavy fermion ( hf ) materials , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ intermetallics of certain rare earths ( res ) like ce , sm and yb , are model systems to study strong electronic correlations @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the re - derived localized @xmath1 states are covalently mixed with the conduction - band states and thus , acquire a finite lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> the associated decay rate in relation to the energy of the localized 4@xmath2 state corresponds to the valency . in a sm - based hf system </S>",
    "<S> the valence lies between 3 + ( @xmath3 ) and 2 + ( @xmath4 ) which implies a considerable amount of charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually referred to as intermediate valence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the above - mentioned mixing of @xmath1 states and the conduction band , which is well described within the framework of one - electron models , a many - body interaction is operating between the @xmath1 and conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this `` kondo effect '' @xcite eventually leads to a screening of the local moments as a result of particle - hole excitations which are manifested by a narrow abrikosov - suhl , or kondo , resonance at @xmath5 the width of which is given by the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath6 .    due to the periodic arrangement of res in a hf intermetallic , the kondo resonances couple to a weakly dispersive hf or `` coherent 4@xmath2- '' band resulting in a heavy fermi liquid state well below @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> the band interaction between the renormalized 4@xmath2 and the conduction band generates a so - called hybridization gap which opens at around @xmath6 . under certain conditions , @xmath5 may reside inside this gap characterizing a so - called kondo insulator @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> smb@xmath0 is such a kondo insulator with a valence @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 being slightly temperature dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp decrease in the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath9 is most dramatically seen in the rise of the resistance over more than three orders of magnitude below @xmath1040 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many other measurements , including far infrared absorption @xcite and nmr @xcite , are consistent with the opening of an activation gap of about 3 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the gradual opening of a hybridization gap of about 18 mev below @xmath10100 k and signatures of inter - ion correlations below @xmath1030 k were recently reported based on point - contact @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gap being caused by hybridization is discussed controversially . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the hybridization is altered by the application of pressure a continuous change of the gap is expected @xcite , while more recent experiments show a discontinuous change @xcite .    intriguingly , unlike in an insulator , the resistance of smb@xmath0 saturates below about 4 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was proposed @xcite that smb@xmath0 may be a strong three - dimensional topological insulator where the topologically non - trivial insulating state is produced by the hybridization between conduction band and coherent 4@xmath2 band . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal sparked a flurry of experimental attempts to demonstrate the existence of such topological surface states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet , arpes could not unambiguously reveal @xcite the associated dirac cones . </S>",
    "<S> our focus , however , is not on these topological properties of smb@xmath0 .    in an effort to study the dos , tunneling @xcite and point contact spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were conducted , most of which indicated the opening of a gap of the order of 20 mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown below , locally ( atomically ) resolved information on the dos is required which can be obtained @xcite by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on smb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in kondo systems like smb@xmath0 tunneling can take place not only into the conduction band but also into the 4@xmath2 states . </S>",
    "<S> the interference of these tunneling processes may give rise to so - called fano resonances @xcite and thereby obscure the dos of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report on the observation of two different types of surfaces resulting from _ in situ _ low - temperature cleave of smb@xmath0 : large areas of reconstructed surfaces and smaller ( typically some nm , rarely a few ten nm ) atomically flat terraces of varying size and termination . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling spectroscopy on the latter , non - reconstructed surfaces appears to reveal the dos of the material within areas of a few nm while the quantum - mechanical interference on areas of some ten nm yields excellent agreement with the prediction for fano resonances . </S>",
    "<S> clear indications for hybridization of the coherent 4@xmath2 and the conduction band as well as the kondo effect are derived in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a finite surface conductance is observed in all cases .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of smb@xmath0 were grown using the aluminum flux method . </S>",
    "<S> smb@xmath0 crystallizes in a cab@xmath0 structure type with space group @xmath11 ( 221 ) , lattice constant @xmath12 4.133  , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> such topographies may extend over several @xmath20 m and clearly attest the simplest solution to avoid the polarization catastrophy associated with polar surface termination planes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of sm and b@xmath0 octahedra in equal amounts and their mixing on short length scales prevents the build - up of long - range electric fields from charged surface areas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the height difference between the two types of corrugations , fig.[recon](d ) , we interpret the bright lines in figs.[recon](a ) and ( b ) as chains of sm atoms residing on top of otherwise flat b terraces , in good agreement with the proposal of a partly occupied sm surface layer @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . apparently , depending on the cleave conditions , the sm and b@xmath0 entities can be disordered ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> s2 , and ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the surface reconstructions , both ordered and disordered , heavily influence the electronic properties of these surfaces . </S>",

    "<S> such surfaces are assigned as b - terminated . </S>",

    "<S> if we assume a fully developed bulk hybridization gap at low @xmath39 , then the cef excitations should take place out of states close to the gap edges yielding a cef excitation energy of 11 mev in line with reported values @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ spec](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a logarithmic @xmath39-dependence is a hallmark of kondo physics and strongly supports a scenario based on the kondo effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fit ( dashed line ) yields a kondo temperature @xmath44 k , in line with other estimates for the opening of the hybridization gap . </S>",

    "<S> however , all other features appear to be shifted towards smaller absolute values of energy ( or @xmath48 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the necessity to involve spectroscopic techniques that allow to discriminate between differently terminated surfaces when analyzing smb@xmath0 surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , also the b - terminated surfaces exhibit a finite conductance at @xmath30 again compatible with an additional ( surface ) conductance channel .    </S>",
    "<S> only very rarely did we succeed in locating larger patches of non - reconstructed areas which clearly exceed lateral dimensions of 10 nm@xmath15 ( so far , such patches were found only on two cleaved surfaces ) . </S>",

    "<S> the height scans along the white lines in ( a ) and ( b ) , which are presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](c ) and ( d ) respectively , were conducted parallel to @xmath23100@xmath24 directions and confirm the expected unit - cell spacing @xmath26 between the corrugations . </S>",
    "<S> there are no discernible intermediate corrugations at any @xmath23110@xmath24 direction in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are obvious in ( b ) : the height scan along the @xmath49110@xmath50 $ ] direction , blue lines marked 2 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](b ) and ( d ) , exhibits corrugations spaced by about @xmath51 as in fig.[unrec](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we attribute the surface of fig.[fano](a ) to a b - terminated one , while fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](b ) represents a sm - terminated surface . </S>",
    "<S> the latter surface exhibits dents of about 80 pm in depth , see blue line 2 in fig.[fano](d ) , corresponding to the height difference between sm and the top - most b atom on a sm - terminated surface ( _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ supplemental material iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that these dents are caused by missing sm atoms probably ripped out of the sm surface layer while cleaving the sample . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , there are only small height variations of some pm resulting in patches of a few lattice constants in extent .    </S>",
    "<S> conducting sts on such an extended non - reconstructed b surface provided @xmath29-curves as exemplary shown in fig.[fano](e ) for @xmath52 k. clearly , such a tunneling conductance is indicative of a fano resonance at energy @xmath53 which results from tunneling into _ two _ coupled channels @xcite , namely the conduction band and the quasiparticle states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , these non - reconstructed areas are large enough to establish coherence in the two tunneling channels . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting tunneling conductance can then be expressed as @xcite : @xmath54 here , the asymmetry parameter @xmath47 is related to the ratio of probabilities for tunneling into the 4@xmath2 states _ vs. _ into the conduction band while @xmath55 describes the resonance width . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  ( [ fanf ] ) was successfully applied to single - impurity @xcite as well as kondo lattice systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , eq .  ( [ fanf ] ) also describes our data excellently even at low @xmath39 and without considering details of the dos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding fit , red line in fig.[fano](e ) , yields @xmath56 mv , a value which agrees well with the width of the hybridization gap discussed above . as to be expected for a b - terminated surface , the value of @xmath57 is smaller than unity consistent with predominant tunneling into the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> note that the asymmetry of the @xmath58-curves ( and hence the sign of @xmath47 ) is a direct consequence of the particle - hole asymmetry of the conduction band @xcite ; the asymmetry shown here is consistent with other stm measurements on a reconstructed surface @xcite but opposite to results from point - contact spectroscopy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an overall very similar behavior is observed for spectra obtained on a sm - terminated surface , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](f ) , with the exception of two additional excitations at around 10 and 25 mev . if these two excitations are ignored , again , a good fit of eq.([fanf ] ) to the data is possible , line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fano](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the so obtained value @xmath59 mev agrees with that of the b - terminated surface , as expected for the hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath60 indicates a more pronounced tunneling into the 4@xmath2 quasiparticle states which appears reasonable on a sm - terminated surface . </S>",
    "<S> both additional excitations have also been seen in earlier measurements in the tunneling regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate that the excitation at 25 mev has its counterpart at @xmath35 mev at smaller non - reconstructed sm surfaces , feature iv ) above , with the respective features at opposite voltage signs masked by other , more pronounced excitations .    also the larger non - reconstructed areas exhibited  as all the investigated surfaces  a finite conductance at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our locally resolved measurements show that the surface reconstruction alone can not account for the surface conductance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the measured conductance at @xmath30 is consistent with an additional conductance channel , possibly at the surface .    in conclusion , we observed two different types of surfaces : predominantly reconstructed surfaces , but occasionally also non - reconstructed ones . for the latter , </S>",
    "<S> sm- as well as b - terminations were found , but larger areas ( lateral extension well beyond 10 nm ) were only encountered very rarely . </S>",
    "<S> sts on non - reconstructed surfaces indicated the formation of a hybridization gap with logarithmic @xmath39-dependence and @xmath61 k as well as inter - multiplet transitions of the sm@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> spectra on larger non - reconstructed areas showed excellent formation of fano resonances establishing the underlying hybridization effect . </S>",
    "<S> all surfaces exhibited a finite conductance consistent with smb@xmath0 being a topological kondo insulator . </S>"
