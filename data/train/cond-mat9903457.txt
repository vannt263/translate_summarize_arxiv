    "the transfer of phonons across the interface between two solids is crucial to the operation of a range of novel devices from semiconductor nanostructures , quantum - cascade lasers , vertical structures , superlattices , quantum dot arrays to the cryogenic phonon - mediated detectors of elementary particles . in such structures non - radiative transitions and",
    "hot - electron thermalization gives rise to fluxes of highly energetic phonons spanning the whole of the brillouin zone .",
    "in early studies @xcite , phonons were regarded as bulk elastic continuum waves so that transmission and reflection of energy at the interface between two materials were a consequence of acoustic mismatch .",
    "such a macroscopic continuum theory describes generic low - frequency properties but does not account for important features such as phonon dispersion , the debye cutoff and weak bonding at the interface , for which a lattice - dynamical model is required @xcite .",
    "most early investigations assume that the solid - solid interface possesses in - plane translational invariance , whereas , it is known that disorder - induced scattering can play a significant role @xcite . within a lowest order perturbation theory @xcite",
    ", it is predicted that disorder can induce a strong frequency dependence in phonon transport coefficients with a power - law crossover determined by interface conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to go beyond this elastic continuum perturbative approach , by formulating an exact lattice - description valid for terahertz phonon transport , which includes features such as phonon dispersion and singularities in the phonon density of states .    to formulate the problem of phonon transmission ( reflection ) we consider two identical semi - infinite leads of uniform cross - section attached to a scattering region. the two semi - infinite perfect crystals are treated as waveguides for incident and scattered phonons whose dynamics is described by the lattice equations of motion .",
    "the geometry analyzed is shown in fig.1 , where the scattering region consists of a single disordered atomic plane .",
    "disorder at the planar interface is introduced microscopically as correlated or uncorrelated random variation of the on - site atomic masses and we assume that there are no significant anharmonic effects . to calculate transport properties of such a system , we use methods specifically developed to investigate electronic transport through phase - coherent structures @xcite .",
    "transport coefficients are calculated as a function of phonon frequency within the landauer - buttiker formalism @xcite by employing an exact recursive green function technique @xcite .",
    "in what follows we present the results for two lattice dynamical models : an fcc lattice with central - force nearest - neighbour interactions and a scalar square lattice . for the former the atomic masses",
    "@xmath0 are located at equilibrium positions @xmath1 , where @xmath2 sum to an even number and @xmath3 is the nearest - neighbour spacing , whereas for the square lattice @xmath4 is the lattice constant and @xmath5 . in the latter case",
    "we do not distinguish between phonon polarizations and hence , are not concerned about mode conversion due to scattering .    in the harmonic approximation the linearized equations of motion of an atom located at @xmath6",
    "is    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the atomic displacement vector ,    @xmath9    and @xmath10 is taken from the first coordination sphere .",
    "the indices @xmath11 label the @xmath12 components of displacements for the fcc model and should be dropped for the scalar model .",
    "all atoms in the semi - infinite leads are of unit mass , whereas the random masses at the interface have mean value unity and standard deviation @xmath13 . for simplicity we allow the masses to fluctuate only along a single direction , which is chosen to be the [ 101 ] and [ 100 ] cubic crystallographic directions for the fcc and square lattice respectively .",
    "henceforth , we refer to this as the disorder - line and denote masses at different positions along the line by @xmath14 .",
    "thus , even for a three dimensional lattice , due to the residual translational invariance , scattering is confined in the plane fixed by the disorder - line and the angle with respect to the interface determined by the conserved component of the incident phonon momentum . from this point of view",
    "our scattering problem is essentialy two dimensional .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath15 positive masses , where @xmath15 is the number of atoms along the direction of the disorder - line in the lead cross - section , is generated as follows : first we introduce the correlated random numbers    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are gaussian random numbers with zero mean value and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is taken commensurate with the phonon wavenumbers determined by the boundary conditions in the transverse direction and @xmath21 denotes the correlation length .",
    "random masses @xmath14 along the disorder - line with mean value unity and standard deviation @xmath13 are obtained from @xmath22 by the linear transformation    @xmath23    in order to isolate the effect of correlations , we compare phonon transmission ( reflection ) coefficients for such correlated interfacial disorder , with those of an uncorrelated disorder configuration obtained by randomly shuffling the above set .",
    "in the absence of inelastic scattering , phonon transport through an arbitrary scattering region can be described by the scattering matrix @xmath24 @xcite , which depends on the conserved phonon frequency and yields probabilities for all scattering transitions within a system described by a dynamical matrix @xmath25 . if the scattering region is connected to external reservoirs by phonon waveguides with open channels labelled by quantum numbers @xmath26 , then @xmath24-matrix elements @xmath27 are defined such that @xmath28 is the outgoing flux of phonons along channel @xmath26 , arising from a unit flux incident along channel @xmath29 .",
    "the scattering matrix defined this way is unitary , i.e. , @xmath30 , and since @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is real , @xmath33 is symmetric .",
    "if @xmath34 belong to the left ( right ) lead then the corresponding @xmath24-matrix elements are left ( right ) reflection amplitudes which we denote @xmath35 , whereas , if @xmath34 belong to the right ( left ) and left ( right ) lead , the @xmath24-matrix elements are left ( right ) transmission amplitudes denoted @xmath36 .",
    "it is evident that for an @xmath37-mode waveguide three distinct transmittances can be defined ,    @xmath38    to isolate the frequency dependence of the overall phonon transmittance it is natural to normalize @xmath39 by the density of states . in the presence of",
    "finite - width leads this means averaging @xmath39 over all open scattering channels @xmath37 and is equivalent to the angle - averaged transmission coefficient ,    @xmath40    which is related to the corresponding reflection coefficient by    @xmath41    in what follows the @xmath24-matrix is obtained by solving dyson s equation for the green function at the surfaces of the two leads @xcite ( see fig.1 for definition of l , r ) , namely    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the surface green function of the semi - infinite leads    @xmath45    and @xmath46 an effective dynamical matrix    @xmath47    the latter describes the effective ( renormalized ) coupling between the surfaces of the two leads , obtained by projecting out the internal degrees of freedom of the scatterer using the recursive green function technique .",
    "the green function @xmath44 , the spectrum and structure of the allowed wavequide modes at fixed phonon density of states , as well as @xmath33 are calculated using a general algorithm developed in ref . @xcite .",
    "we present results for the average transmission coefficient @xmath48 where the subscript c denotes a configurational averaging . in fig.2(a),(b )",
    "the frequency dependence of the overall transmission coefficient @xmath48 averaged over 10 realizations of the interfacial mass - disorder for the fcc lattice and over 500 for the scalar square lattice is shown .",
    "the width of the disorder - line is 29 and 100 nearest - neighbour spacings respectively , which corresponds to @xmath49 and @xmath50 degrees of freedom .    for the fcc model periodic boundary conditions in the lateral direction ( disorder - line )",
    "were used , whereas for the scalar model we adopted fixed - end boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions set the precise frequencies at which propagating waveguide modes become available in the external leads , but apart from features which scale inversely with the number of such modes do not affect the shape of the transmittance curves .",
    "figure 2 shows that for both fcc and scalar lattices , phonon transmittances ( reflectances ) follow the same universal behaviour . at sufficiently low frequencies ,",
    "the phonon transmittance for correlated disorder is lower than for uncorrelated interfacial disorder with the same mean mass and standard deviation @xmath13 .    at low frequencies the results of lattice - dynamical calculations in fig.2(a),(b )",
    "are in good agreement with perturbation theory @xcite . to model the disorder in @xcite a thin layer of dissimilar material sandwiched between irregular boundaries was introduced .",
    "the density and elastic constants of this layer were assumed to differ from those of the bulk on either side of the layer . to make a comparison with the perturbative analysis we consider the case of no fluctuation in the elastic constants and a line of random masses at the location of the idealized interfacial plane @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 a random function of lateral coordinate with zero mean value .",
    "apart from lattice discreteness which plays no significant role in the long - wavelength limit there is no difference between our model of site - to - site mass disorder and the model of interfacial roughness of ref .",
    "the following relation is useful when comparing the results    @xmath54    for such a two dimensional model the perturbation theory @xcite with uncorrelated disorder @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where k is the phonon wavevector , yields @xmath57    while for correlated disorder at sufficiently high frequencies so that @xmath58 the perturbative result is    @xmath59    more generally for all @xmath60 , fig.2(c ) shows the perturbative results for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . equations ( [ per1 ] ) and ( [ per2 ] ) are in good agreement with the exact lattice - dynamical calculation .",
    "they both show lower transmittance for correlated disorder over a wide range of frequencies until the faster power dependence of phonon transmittance for uncorrelated disorder causes the two curves to cross at a frequency @xmath63 . according to the perturbative calculations @xmath63 should be close to half the maximum phonon frequency @xmath64 independent of disorder characteristics , correlation length and strength . despite the similarities ,",
    "this is not evident in the lattice - dynamical calculations .",
    "indeed , the crossing point is quite close to a singularity in the phonon density of states and thus using an elastic continuum model at frequencies of order @xmath63 is an oversimplification .",
    "another simplifying assumption of the theory in ref.@xcite is the neglect of multiple scattering .",
    "this gives the power law @xmath65 ( rayleigh scattering ) with subsequent decrease by one ( two ) power(s ) for correlated disorder in 2d ( 3d ) .",
    "a log - log plot of phonon reflectances showed that both lattice dispersion and multiple phonon scattering effects result in a change of the power exponents to a slightly different value .",
    "however , the drop by approximately one power for our 2d scattering problem in the case of correlated disorder prevails in all cases .",
    "the effect is attributed to the restrictions in the phase volume available for the scattered states , due to the correlation - induced finite width of the disordered spectral distribution .",
    "phonon transmittances over the whole frequency spectrum for the scalar model for two different values of disorder strength @xmath13 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "in addition to the low frequency behaviour discussed in sec .",
    "iv , the transmittance shows a cusp at a frequency corresponding to a van hove singularity in the phonon density of states and rapidly drops to zero at the maximum frequency of the phonon spectrum @xmath64 . at the van hove singularity",
    "the difference between correlated and uncorrelated disorder realizations is much less pronounced .",
    "all these features are also seen for the fcc model but the exact behaviour at van hove singularities is less clear due to the finite - size effects described in the previous section . to interpret the results we concentrate on the scalar model .",
    "the general expression for the transmission amplitude from incident channel @xmath29 to channel @xmath26 for systems with nearest - neighbour interactions has been derived in @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression for the scalar model with periodic boundary conditions is    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the component of the group velocity in _ x_-direction along the lead axis of the @xmath26-th channel mode , m labels sites at the interface ( along lateral direction ) , and @xmath68 has been defined in eq.([green ] ) .",
    "the matrix w is given by @xcite    @xmath69    in formulae ( [ amplit],[w ] ) , @xmath70 , as a result of transverse quantization with periodic boundary conditions , while @xmath71 denotes the wavenumber along the lead axis for phonons of fixed frequency @xmath60 of state @xmath26 ( @xmath26-th channel ) .    using the complete orthonormalized set of functions @xmath72 describing the profile of modes in the transverse direction , @xmath73 can be written    @xmath74    by substitution of eq.([w]),([green1 ] ) to ( [ amplit ] ) one obtains    @xmath75    thus , to calculate the channel - to - channel transmittance @xmath76 or generally the overall transmittance @xmath77 one needs to consider the non - trivial statistically averaged product of two green functions , @xmath78 or @xmath79 .    in",
    "what follows , we shall demonstrate that generic features can be captured by considering the case of a regular array of atoms with mass @xmath80 located at the interface , thereby forming a linear(planar ) defect in a two(three ) dimensional system .    in this case , the full green function @xmath81 is of the form    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the green function of the infinite ideal lead at coinciding arguments , and @xmath84 is the relative mass difference at the location of the defects . substituting this result into eq.([trans2 ] ) and ( [ amplit1 ] ) yields for the transmittance    @xmath85    eq.([total ] ) exhibits the following features : ( i)@xmath86 equals unity for an ideal interface with @xmath87 .",
    "( ii)at low frequencies both @xmath88 , @xmath89 and therefore @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is numerical coefficient , in full agreement with the results of perturbation theory @xcite and formula ( [ per2 ] ) .",
    "( iii)at the end of the phonon spectrum @xmath92 since propagating channels are closing with @xmath93 approaching zero at the brillouin zone boundaries .",
    "this effect is analogous to the total reflection by a single mass defect in one dimension .",
    "( iv)at the van hove singularity all channels are open and eq.([total ] ) reduces to    @xmath94    which suggests that for @xmath95 the dependence on disorder strength is much weaker than at low frequencies . also , @xmath96 is small for a large number of contributing channels thereby yielding the characteristic cusp .",
    "( v)we also note that eq.([total ] ) has been derived for the [ 100 ] orientation of the interface but since the phonon group velocity along the lead axis is proportional to @xmath93 the transmittance is in general anisotropic .    in fig.4(a ) , we plot the phonon transmittance given by formula ( [ total ] ) for selected values of @xmath97 along with the numerical results for correlated disorder realizations .",
    "notice that in spite of the differences in the type of interfacial defect the curves look very similar .",
    "a natural way to explain this result is to view the interface for correlated disorder as a mosaic of clusters of average diameter @xmath98 .",
    "suppose that within a particular cluster @xmath99 all sites are occupied by defects with the same mass and characteristic relative mass difference @xmath100 .",
    "as long as the phonon wavelength is smaller than the correlation length , i.e. , @xmath58 , the overall transmittance can be considered as the average over all clusters with local transmittances given by eq.([total ] ) . in fig.4(b ) such an average is plotted for clusters with excess mass fully balanced by clusters with mass deficit .",
    "the relative mass difference is taken from a gaussian distribution with width equal to the disorder strength @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , this procedure gives a better fit to the correlated disorder curve , which suggests that the phonon transmittance across a correlated disordered interface can be split to a statistically averaged mean field contribution induced by mosaic grains and a fluctuating component .",
    "the latter is controlled by the rapid residual variations in the relative mass difference at the cluster boundaries as well as the fluctuations in cluster sizes .",
    "the qualitative agreement between correlated disorder realizations and the mosaic picture prompts us to ask whether there exists a simple model for the case of uncorrelated disorder . to explore this possibility",
    ", we examine a two - colour disorder model where linear interfacial defects are built up from atoms with relative mass difference @xmath97 which alternates sign every @xmath101 sites .",
    "this model is motivated by the observation that uncorrelated disorder contains all spatial harmonics with equal probability .",
    "in what follows , we compare the exact transmittance for uncorelated disorder with that of the two - colour model , averaged over many values of @xmath102 . in fig.5",
    ", we plot the mean arithmetic value of the phonon transmittances for @xmath103 taken after averaging over 500 two - colour disorder realizations given by a gaussian distribution with zero mean and @xmath104 .",
    "the remarkable agreement with the calculations for the uncorrelated disorder over a wide range of frequencies suggests that the mean field contribution for this case can be calculated by picking up few elements from the basis set of the two - colour disorder model .    finally , we compare the results of our calculation with the diffuse mismatch model _ dmm _ introduced in @xcite and extensively used in studies of kapitza conductance @xcite .",
    "application of the dmm at a boundary between two solids with identical acoustic properties gives a @xmath105 phonon transmittance independent of frequency .",
    "it can be easily demonstrated that the kapitza conductance @xmath106 for our model is larger than that predicted by the dmm .",
    "it is also less than the radiation limit which in this case would coincide with acoustic mismatch theory ( total transmission ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath106 is larger for uncorrelated disorder than for correlated .",
    "finally , one notes that the results of @xcite which are valid for phonon transmission through the ideal interface between two different fcc crystals a transmittance which is frequency - independent over the whole spectrum up to a cut - off frequency corresponding to maximum phonon frequency in one of the crystals , whereas , in our model the phonon transmittance is a strong function of frequency .",
    "in summary , generic properties of elastic phonon transport at a disordered interface were studied by computing the exact scattering properties of a single disordered atomic layer sandwiched between identical waveguides .",
    "the results show that phonon transmittance is a strong function of frequency and the disorder correlation length . at frequencies lower than the van hove singularity the transmittance at a given frequency increases as the correlation length decreases . at low frequencies ,",
    "this is reflected by different power - laws for phonon conductance across correlated and uncorrelated disordered interfaces which are in approximate agreement with perturbation theory of an elastic continuum @xcite .",
    "we also investigated simple mosaic and two - colour models of the interface and showed that phonon transmittance through interfaces with correlated and uncorrelated disorder can be understood in terms of phonon conductances of structures with regular interfaces ."
