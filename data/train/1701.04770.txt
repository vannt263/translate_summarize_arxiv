    "chern - simons ( cs ) theories have found applications in various areas , from gauge field theories and three - dimensional gravity @xcite to condensed matter physics . in the latter case ,",
    "cs formalism has been applied to phenomena that exhibit topological properties , a remarkable example of that being the quantum hall effect , occuring in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but , also in 3d space , cs theories have become relevant .",
    "the so - called @xmath0-term introduced in qcd by peccei and quinn , and generalized by wilczek , represent the 3 + 1 spacetime dimension version of cs forms.@xcite . in recent years",
    ", the novel 3d topological insulators have become a new example of the above , and intensive research has been developed in the field @xcite .",
    "a 3d cs theory is characterized by the term @xmath1 in the action , which is a border term and it is relevant only on the system boundaries . as a consequence , electromagnetic radiation inciding on the interface between an ordinary medium and a @xmath0-system , matter or even pure vacuum , exhibits a polarization rotation both for reflected and refracted waves .",
    "the effect is modulated by the interplay between magnetic and dielectric properties of the system and the value of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "this phenomenon has been reported as the kerr - faraday rotation present in topological insulators @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "apart from the effect of polarization , the interface reflectance increases compared to ordinary systems . in a previous paper we reported in detail the optical properties of a @xmath0-material interface @xcite .",
    "the above phenomena are even stronger in the case of pure vacuum , where the only difference between the @xmath0-vacuum and the surrounding medium is a nonzero value for @xmath0 inside the system @xcite . at both sides of the interface , however , electromagnetic propagation is the same .",
    "although the @xmath0-vacuum case is the clearest manifestation of the peculiarity involved in these systems , applications to material systems are interesting and useful , since nontrivial topology is an extended issue in physics .",
    "in particular , the study of thin @xmath0-films properties could be relevant for applications , since they are often seen in such a geometry @xcite .",
    "we study here the optical properties of a generic thin @xmath0-film , surrounded by ordinary matter or vacuum .",
    "we also include the possibility of pure vacuum in both the film and the medium outside .",
    "in particular , we investigate theoretically the system behavior under electromagnetic radiation .",
    "since in ( 3 + 1)d , cs term becomes a boundary term , it will not contribute to field equations in the bulk of a system , but will only affect the system at its boundaries .    for thin films ,",
    "interference effects are interesting , those resulting from the multiple coherent superposition of waves emerging on both sides of the film , and that is a relevant topic in the present paper .",
    "this report is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the basics of the theory and recall some results for a single interface , from ref .  @xcite . in the following sections we develop our approach to the film problem and",
    "present our findings .",
    "for a @xmath0-system interacting with electromagnetic fields , as in the case of radiation , the action is written as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the maxwell action ) , and field equations are modified only at the boundaries .",
    "we denote the boundary surface by @xmath4 , with a locally defined normal unit vector @xmath5 pointing inside the system . in terms of noncovariant electric and magnetic fields ,",
    "the field equations are @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the material , respectively .. consequently , the vacuum magnetoelectric properties are @xmath9 , and the system s @xmath7 , @xmath8 are dimensionless . ]",
    "the delta function in the rhs of the above equations stands for restricting the effects to the surface , with the corresponding terms representing the surface charge and current densities built from the electromagnetic field itself .",
    "the set of equations is completed with the homogeneous maxwell equations @xmath10 and @xmath11 . by the standard procedure",
    ", we obtain a pair of discontinuity conditions at the interface @xmath4 : @xmath12 & = & \\theta { \\bf{b}}_{\\rm n } \\label{emat_discon } \\\\ \\left [ \\dfrac{1}{\\mu } { \\bf b}_\\tau \\right ]   & = &   - \\theta { \\bf e}_\\tau .",

    "the symbol @xmath15 $ ] must be interpreted as the difference between the fields evaluated immediately inside and immediately outside the @xmath0-material . additionally , we have , from the homogeneous equations , the standard continuity of @xmath16 and @xmath17 components .",
    "we consider a linearly polarized planar electromagnetic wave inciding on the boundary surface of a @xmath0-system , with an angle @xmath18 with respect to the normal .",
    "the standard laws of reflection and refraction hold , independently of the polarization , and the transmitted wave into the @xmath0-medium is refracted with an angle @xmath19 . by applying the boundary conditions derived above , we find the electromagnetic field amplitudes for the transmitted ( refracted ) and reflected waves .",
    "we adopt the usual decomposition of the fields in parallel ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) components with respect to the incidence plane , and introduce the adimensional field amplitudes in terms of the incident wave field @xmath24 : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , and similar definitions for the corresponding @xmath23 components . , where @xmath29 is the respective refraction index of the medium and @xmath30 is the corresponding unit wave vector . ] then , for the transmitted wave , we find @xcite @xmath31 and , for the reflected wave , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
