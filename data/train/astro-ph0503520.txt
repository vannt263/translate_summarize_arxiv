    "low and intermediate mass stars with masses ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 m@xmath3 undergo dramatic changes in temperature and luminosity during their evolution . for example",
    ", the luminosity of the sun , which is located on the main sequence of the hertzprung - russell diagram , currently is 30 percent greater than its zero - age ( initial ) luminosity ( gough 1981 ) .",
    "other major changes take place after the sun evolves off the main sequence .",
    "along the red giant branch ( rgb ) the radius of a 1 m@xmath3 star progressively increases up to @xmath8 10 r@xmath3 , and the luminosity increases up to about @xmath9 l@xmath3 ( maeder & meynet 1988 ) .",
    "then , after leaving the rgb a star evolves onto the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . at this stage in its evolution ,",
    "its radius increases up to a few hundred times r@xmath3 and the luminosity up to nearly @xmath10 l@xmath3 .",
    "the lifetime of a 1 m@xmath3 star , from the moment it leaves the main sequence until the end of the rgb , is of about 2.5 @xmath11 yr , which can be compared to @xmath8 10@xmath11 yr spent on the main sequence .",
    "the evolution of a star is accompanied by mass loss processes that play an important role . during the post - main sequence evolution of a 1 m@xmath3 star",
    "nearly 0.4 m@xmath3 will be lost to the interstellar medium before it ends its life as a white dwarf ( weidemann 1987 ) .",
    "the `` habitable zone '' is conservatively defined as a shell region around a star where liquid water can be found at the surface of a planet .",
    "this zone is typically from about 0.95 au to 1.37 au for g stars ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 , forget 1998 ) .",
    "a less conservatively defined `` habitable zone '' extends the outer edge of the limit of the habitable zone , to as large as 2.4 au , depending radiative properties of @xmath12 ice clouds ( forget & pierrehumbert 1997 , mischna et al . 2000 ) .",
    "consequently , as the temperature and luminosity of a star changes during the course its evolution , the radius and width of this zone will also evolve with time ( see section  2 ) .",
    "the habitable zone gradually moves outward after a star leaves the main sequence .",
    "depending on the length of time that is necessary for life to form , we show that it is possible that life may exist or develop on a planet that is located within a range of 2 - 9 au from a 1 m@xmath3 star , during the first stages of its post main - sequence evolution and up to 22 au from the star during the second stage after the core he flash . in section 3 this is discussed further , considering also the effects of natural migration of micro - organisms through meteorites as a possible trigger for the emergence of life around evolved stars ( arrhenius 1903 , okeefe et al .",
    "1996 , zubrin 2001 ) .",
    "micro - organisms might also transport life from one planet to another planet during the evolution of a star .",
    "for example , they could be transported from a planet where life is ending to a more distant planet where favorable conditions for the re - birth of life are encountered because of the `` sufficiently slow '' evolution of the habitable zone .",
    "future space missions , such as tpf ( beichman , woolf , & lindensmith 1999 ) and darwin ( fridlund & gondoin 2003 ) , that focus on searches of signatures of life on extrasolar planets primarily around main - sequence stars , should also consider the environments of sub - giant and red giant stars .",
    "pathfinder missions such as epic ( clampin et al .",
    "2001 ) , eclipse ( trauger et al .",
    "2003 ) , and fksi ( danchi et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) may also be able to observe planets around red giant stars .",
    "based on a list of selected objects we evaluate the difficulty of coronagraphic and interferometric observations of planets around red giant stars compared to a main sequence star environment ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results and conclude that research engaged in the field of extrasolar planets and life should not omit searches for planets orbiting evolved stars .",
    "terrestrial planets in the environment of evolved stars are sites of interest for understanding the development of life .",
    "from a biological point of view and given the limits of our present knowledge , the existence of life is strongly associated with the presence of liquid water ( brack 1993 ) . in this respect",
    "the `` habitable zone '' is currently defined as the range of distances from a star within which a planet may contain liquid water at its surface .",
    "several evaluations of the inner and outer limits of the habitable zone have been proposed , as discussed in the review of forget ( 1998 ) .",
    "a conservative estimate , minimizing the width of the habitable zone ( forget 1998 ) , assumes that around our own sun the habitable zone currently ranges from 0.95 to 1.67 au .",
    "the inner limit of this conservative estimate is set by an atmospheric water loss effect occurring in the stratosphere of a planet , provided water vapor is injected into it from the planet s surface ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 , kasting 1998 ) .",
    "the outer limit is set by the lowest temperature at which the liquid / solid phase change of water occurs .",
    "the estimate of this outer limit assumes the existence of a greenhouse effect involving co@xmath13 and h@xmath13o gas ( kasting et al .",
    "a less conservatively defined `` habitable zone '' extends the outer edge of the limit of the habitable zone to as large as 2.4 au , depending radiative properties of @xmath12 ice clouds .",
    "an optically thick condensing @xmath12 atmosphere with particles having radii larger than 6 - 8 @xmath14 m has a very efficient greenhouse effect that maintains the surface temperature above the freezing point of water ( forget & pierrehumbert 1997 , mischna et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of the transit of the habitable zone as a consequence of stellar evolution . a convenient way of estimating the inner and outer limit of the habitable zone at different stages of stellar evolution is to assume that the planet behaves as a gray - body with albedo , @xmath15 , and with perfect heat conductivity ( implying the temperature is uniform over the planet s surface ) .",
    "its radiative equilibrium temperature , @xmath16 , is then determined by  :    @xmath17^{0.25}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the luminosity of the star , @xmath19 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath20 is the distance from the center of the star to the planet . typically a value of approximately 0.2 is chosen for the albedo to be representative of an earth - like planet .",
    "for these calculations we determine the temperature at the limits of the habitable zone , and from this we calculate the inner and outer distances for a given star .",
    "if the albedo is wavelength independent , then terms due to the albedo cancel out of the calculation .    in the following calculations we use both the conservative limits of the habitable zone and the less conservative limit around our sun ( forget 1998 , forget and pierrehumbert 1997 , mischna et al .",
    "2000 ) . for the conservative limit , we assume an effective equilibrium temperature of 269 k and 203 k , which for the sun gives inner and outer limits of 0.95 and 1.37 au , respectively . for the less conservative limit ,",
    "the equilibrium temperature is 169 k , so that the outer limit is extended to 2.4 au .",
    "the three equilibrium temperature extrema , defined as the inner and the 2 possible outer limits , can be used to derive the approximate location and width of the habitable zone around a star at different stages of its evolution .",
    "models describing the stellar evolution are proposed by maeder and meynet ( 1988 ) . for intermediate mass stars having masses from 2 to 5",
    "m@xmath3 the evolution is followed up to the end of the early asymptotic giant branch . for stars with masses less than 1.7 m@xmath3 ,",
    "the evolution is calculated up the he - flash occuring at the end of the rgb part of the hr diagram ( iben 1967 ) .",
    "maeder and meynet s ( 1988 ) models are used in the following figures to determine the effect of stellar evolution upon the habitable zone , i.e. , its outward transit and increase in width .",
    "figure 1(a ) displays the time evolution of the inner and outer limits defining the habitable zone assuming the initial mass of the star is 1 m@xmath3 .",
    "the solid curve represents the evolution of the inner limit of the habitable zone , while the dashed curve depicts the conservative outer limit , and the dotted curve represents the less conservative outer limit .",
    "the distance between the center of the star and the habitable zone increases progressively with time , from 1 au to tens of au ( upper limit represented in the figures ) .",
    "note that it is easy to show from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that this distance is proportional to the square root of the stellar luminosity , which greatly increases as the star ascends the red giant and asymptotic giant branches of the hr diagram .",
    "the width of the habitable zone also increases with time and is also proportional to the square root of the stellar luminosity .",
    "thus the width is directly proportional to the distance between the star and the habitable zone .",
    "therefore , during the course of stellar evolution , the habitable zone is a shell sweeping progressively outward over a wide range of distances from the star as can be seen in figure 1(c ) .",
    "the dashed curve represents the duration of the habitable zone for the conservative assumptions for the inner and outer limits of the habitable zone .",
    "the dotted curve assumes the same inner limit of the habitable zone but the less conservative outer limit is used .",
    "the duration of the transit during which the habitable zone passes over a planet located at 1 au from a star is of the order of 10@xmath4 years .",
    "figure 1(b ) displays the evolution of the stellar radius ( in units of solar radii ) during the time period shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "immediately after the star leaves the main sequence , the habitable zone progressively moves to 2 au ( figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "the duration of the transit at this location is approximately 10@xmath4 years .",
    "a bump / plateau is observed in the curve up to 9 au ( for the conservative limits ) and up to 13 au ( for the less conservative limits ) , where the duration of habitable conditions lasts from a few to several 10@xmath5 years . at 10",
    "au the duration is smaller , around 10@xmath5 years . at 15 au from the star ,",
    "the duration of habitable conditions lasts more than 10@xmath21 years , and at the largest distances the duration gradually decreases .",
    "thus the evolution of the habitable zone at distances up to 25 au has been considered . during this time period",
    ", a 1 m@xmath3 star has not yet reached the agb .",
    "the bump / plateau observed up to 9 - 13 au increases the duration of habitability conditions .",
    "this bump results from a local maximum in luminosity followed by a local minimum along the rgb related to the first dredge - up .    for a 1.5 m@xmath3 star ,",
    "the evolution of the habitable zone is much more rapid since the star itself evolves faster than a 1 m@xmath3 star .",
    "plots of the inner and outer limits of the habitable zone , the radius of the star , and the duration of the habitable zone for this case is shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b ) , and 2(c ) , respectively . when the star is on the main sequence , the transit of habitable zone , at 3 au , lasts more than 10@xmath4 years . at 5 au",
    "the transit may last from 10@xmath5 to several 10@xmath5 years ( depending on the limits assumed for the habitable zone ) .",
    "interestingly , even though the star evolves rapidly , the duration of the passage of the habitable zone at distances less that 15 au from the star remains greater than 10@xmath21 years .",
    "bumps are observed in the curve since the variations ( just after the main sequence and along the rgb ascent in the hr diagram ) of the effective temperature and luminosity of the star is non - monotonic .",
    "for a 2 m@xmath3 star ( figs .",
    "3(a)-3(c ) ) the habitable zone is at @xmath8 5 au during the main sequence stage .",
    "after the star leaves the main sequence the transit of the habitable zone may last more than 10@xmath5 years for distances less than 10 - 15 au .",
    "it is interesting to note that the habitable zone jumps at about 1.7 gyrs over a period lasting less than 25 million years ( see figure 3(a ) ) .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated the duration of the habitable zone for different stellar masses , but we have not considered the _ actual _ mass distribution of red giants in our own solar neighborhood . clearly the longest lived habitable zones are those for the low mass red giant stars that evolve most slowly off the main sequence , as is evident from the present discussion and figs . 1 - 3 , as well as table 1 , described below .",
    "although individual masses of red giant stars are not well known in general , and have not been directly determined except in a few cases , neckel ( 1975 ) has shown theoretically that the peak of the red giant mass distribution occurs at progenitor masses of about 1.1 m@xmath3 .",
    "an empirical estimate of red giant masses determined by scalo , dominy , and pumphrey ( 1978 ) is in agreement with the theoretical estimate , with values 0.8  1.2 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is fortunate since stars selected in a magnitude - limited or distance - limited survey will therefore mostly likely be low mass stars that have long habitable zone lifetimes similar to those calculated in fig . 1 in this paper .",
    "also , it is important to note that the calculations in this paper are focused on the evolution of the habitable zone from the time period after the star evolves off the main sequence up the first ascent along the red giant branch during which the star is burning hydrogen in a shell around a growing he core , i.e. , only to the point of the helium flash . after the helium flash , there is an additional long - lived phase of quiescent core helium burning with nearly constant luminosity .",
    "scalo and miller ( 1979 ) developed very simple interpolation formulae for the lifetime of a star at its various stages of evolution : main sequence , subgiant , first red giant , and first and second helium burning phases , as a function of initial stellar mass .",
    "for completeness we display the lifetimes computed from their formulae for stellar masses of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 m@xmath3 , which we display in table 1 . for a 1.0 m@xmath3 star ,",
    "core helium burning provides a nearly constant luminosity phase , adding an additional @xmath2 years to the duration of the habitable zone for low mass stars , with substantial increases to the lifetime of the habitable zone for higher mass stars as well .",
    "the luminosity during the core helium burning phase is approximately @xmath22 l@xmath3 , @xmath23 l@xmath3 , and @xmath22 l@xmath3 , for 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 m@xmath3 stars , respectively ( kozlowski & paczynski , 1975 ) .",
    "thus an additional period of habitability exists for the region between 7 and 22 au for a 1 m@xmath3 star during core helium burning .",
    "the he core flash that precedes this phase is not an explosive event nor does it affect the star s external luminosity very much .",
    "this was discussed in the pioneering papers by schwarzschild & harm ( 1962 , 1964 ) , and subsequently analyzed in more detail by mengel & gross ( 1975 ) , paczynski & tremaine ( 1977 ) , paczynski ( 1979 ) , and by deupree ( 1996 ) . the main consequence to the stellar luminosity after the he core flash is an initial _ decrease _ in luminosity for about @xmath24 to @xmath25 years , followed by an increase to approximately the same value as before the flash , i.e. , near the peak luminosity at the tip of the first ascent along the red giant branch ( despain , 1981 ) .",
    "over a period of @xmath26 to @xmath27 years the star gradually becomes less luminous , and it settles down to a state of nearly constant luminosity of about @xmath28 l@xmath3 ( despain , 1981 ; chiosi , bertelli , and bressan , 1992 ) statistically the result is a  clump \" of stars of this luminosity close to the rgb .",
    "the constancy of luminosity for this `` clump '' of stars , which is about a factor of 10 lower than at the tip of the rgb , is a result of the fact that stars of different initial masses converge toward a common value of the he core mass ( chiosi , bertelli , & bressan , 1992 ) .    for a 1 m@xmath3 star the duration of the rise in luminosity as a star evolves upwards along",
    "the rgb is relatively rapid , lasting @xmath8 @xmath29 years as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . during this period of time the habitable zone moves rapidly outward , such that the inner radius is @xmath30 20 au from the star .",
    "once the star settles into the core he burning phase , the region between 7 and 22 au becomes habitable again .",
    "thus there is a  fresh start \" for life in this phase of stellar evolution .",
    "we summarize our analysis of the evolution of the habitable zone by noting that there are two opportunities for life in the extended habitable zones around evolved stars . initially life has an opportunity as the star slowly evolves off the main sequence .",
    "after the first ascent along the rgb and the he core flash , there is a second chance during the core he burning phase .",
    "this latter phase is particularly interesting because of the nearly constant luminosity of the star and the long duration under these conditions .",
    "the earth is known to have formed about 4.55 gyr ago .",
    "substantial evidence exists that life on earth occurred at least as far as 3.85 gyr ago rests on the basis of isotopic ratios of carbon residues within grains of apatite ( mojzsis et al .",
    "1997 , holland 1997 ) .",
    "the oldest purported fossils of microorganisms have an age of 3.50 gyr and may represent photosynthetic cyanobacteria were reported by schopf ( 1993 , 1994 ) . the findings and interpretation of this work",
    "was recently debated ( brasier et al . 2002 , dalton 2002 ) .",
    "rocks older than 3.60 gyr are all metamorphosed at a high grade and most are strongly deformed , thus morphological fossils if originally present are unlikely to be preserved ( rosing 1999 ) .    based on these considerations , it is possible for life to have existed at least as long ago as 3.85 gyr , but this is uncertain because of the imprecise knowledge of the ages of the rocks , and ambiguous interpretations of the isotopic @xmath31 ratios . thus , for our discussion , we consider three time scales for life to form , a conservative estimate of 1 gyr , and a less conservative one of 0.5 gyr , and an optimistic one of 0.1 gyr .",
    "recent analyses of isotopic @xmath32c ratios on micron - scale mineralized tubes in archean pillow lavas by furnes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that microbial life colonized these oceanic volcanic rocks soon after they were formed approximately 3.5 gyr ago .",
    "this provides some further support for the optimistic time scales of a few hundred million years or less for life formation .",
    "dating of terrestrial fossils reveals that life had evolved on earth by the end of the period of heavy bombardment .",
    "evidence for the bombardment comes from theoretical studies of planetary formation and directly from lunar cratering .",
    "heavy bombardment may have helped set the stage for the terrestrial origin of life by delivering key biogenic elements ( h , c , n ) to the earth s surface ( chyba et al .",
    "1994 ) . for its first 800 myr",
    ", the earth s surface would have been subjected to frequent impacts , possibly delaying the development and spread of life ( maher and stevenson 1988 ) .",
    "sleep et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate that the time period for the earth to cool off after heavy bombardment to a temperature at which life could form is surprisingly short , in the range of @xmath33 to @xmath27 years .    due to the rapid evolution of a star once it has left the main sequence ,",
    "the transit time of the habitable zone shortens . for an evolved 1 m@xmath3 star ,",
    "the transit of the habitable zone crossing a planet at 2 au of distance lasts slightly more than 10@xmath4 years , a time scale clearly larger than the time which has been required for the emergence of life on earth .    at about 5 au of distance",
    ", the duration of habitable conditions lasts from 10@xmath5 years to several 10@xmath5 years , which is about one order of magnitude shorter than the time estimated for occurrence of life on earth .",
    "even if the formation of life takes longer than 10@xmath5 years , it is still possible for pre - existing life ( in the form known on earth ) to adapt itself to a new planet containing liquid water .",
    "micro - organisms could be transported from a planet where life is ending to one where favorable conditions for its re - birth are encountered due to the transit of the habitable zone . in this sense",
    "the transportation of microorganisms through meteorites can be a trigger for life development around evolved stars .",
    "the possible migration of life through meteorites has been discussed by arrhenius ( 1903 ) , okeefe et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and zubrin ( 2001 ) , while the possibility of micro - organisms transporting life in a planetary system either from planet to planet or between different planetary systems has also been studied ( mileikowsky et al .",
    "2000 , mastrapa et al .",
    "the transportation of material between planetary systems has recently gained support from the possible discovery of extrasolar micro - meteors ( meisel et al .",
    "2002 ) . of course , the time scales are longer because the distances are larger . meteorites or comets may have been expelled from our solar system up to 3.5 billion years ago ( when life first appeared on earth ) with biomolecules or even primitive microorganisms on them .",
    "after a journey of a billion years or more in interstellar space , they may have been captured by nearby planetary systems ( up to a few tens of light years ) and may have seeded other planets with suitable conditions for the development of life .",
    "mathematical simulations have shown that the probability for expulsion of a meteorite or a comet from a planetary system is not negligible ( gladman et al 1996 ) .",
    "current theoretical debate centers on the probability of capture by an extrasolar planet . however , recent calculations by melosh ( 2003 ) suggest that the probability of interstellar transfer of meteoric material between planets on two different stars in the solar neighborhood ( for single stars ) is extremely small .",
    "however in the case of red giant environments , the probability of capture of meteoritic material ejected from a planetary body is reasonably large ( melosh , 2003 ) . using this mechanism",
    ", life can be transported from one planet to another during the expansion of the habitable zone .    it has been demonstrated both by laboratory and space experiments that biomolecules and even micro - organisms can survive space travel in interplanetary conditions , i.e. , low temperature , vacuum , uv radiation , and the shock experienced while impacting a solid planet ( burchell et al 2001 , roten et al 1998 , okeefe et al 1996 ) .",
    "all these considerations are part of the hypothesis called panspermia ( arrhenius 1903 , becquerel 1910a , 1910b ) that there may be an `` interfertilisation '' between planets ( mileykowsky 1997 , portner et al 1961 ) .    in the case of our own solar system at 2 au , it is possible that in the future ( assuming the presence of liquid water is encountered during a time scale compatible with the time for occurrence of life on earth ) life may appear on the planet mars if some ( presently hypothetical ) frozen liquid water can be melted .",
    "liquid water also could be produced on europa as a consequence of the evolution of the sun .",
    "however , since the mass of europa is relatively small , it may be difficult for it to maintain an atmosphere for a long time , and hence could evaporate into space . a more massive body like titan is perhaps better adapted to host life ( transit at 10 au from several 10@xmath21 years to about 10@xmath5 years ) .",
    "this speculative scenario assumes that no change in the orbits of the planets will occur during the next 6@xmath3410@xmath4 years . from the point of view of dynamical orbital changes related to stellar evolution",
    ", this assumption seems reasonable .",
    "effects of the stellar mass loss phenomena and tidal dissipation between the planets and the red giant star are not negligible in the dynamics of the orbits ( rasio et al .",
    "a sun - like star will lose about 24@xmath35 of its initial mass during the rgb phase and about 20@xmath35 during the agb phase ( schrder and sedlmayr 2001 ) .",
    "the transit of the habitable zone that we have calculated , with a reasonably long duration for the development of life , happens along the rgb , at a stage during which the star has a radius less than @xmath8 100 r@xmath3 . in fig . 2 of rasio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , when a sun like star reaches a radius of about 100 r@xmath3 , only a little more than 10 @xmath35 of the initial mass of the star has been lost , and the effect of this mass loss among the dynamical changes of the planet orbits ( for planets more distant than 1 au not yet subject to tidal effects ) is to increase by 10 @xmath35 the semi - major axis . the work of rasio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) does consider the reimers relation for representing the mass loss , according to parameters used in sackmann et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that the increase of the semi - major axis , if occuring for a planet during a time when it is in the habitable zone ( itself expanding ) , will tend to increase the time duration of habitable conditions for the planet .",
    "planets around evolved stars of the class of sub - giant and red giant may offer favorable conditions for hosting life at a few au . in the few next decades",
    ", the search for life around different type of stars could be made using proposed space interferometers , such as the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) ( beichman , woolf , & lindensmith 1999 ) and darwin ( fridlund & gondoin 2003 ) .",
    "recently , a giant planet candidate around a subgiant class star has been discovered by means of radial velocity measurements ( frink et al .",
    "the detected planet has m  @xmath36 = 8.9 m@xmath37 ( making it a planet candidate ) , and is orbiting at 1.3 au from the center of the star .",
    "the parent star , hip 75458 , is a k2iii subgiant class star with log l / l@xmath3 = 1.85 solar luminosity ( mallik 1999 ) and with a mass of 1.05 m@xmath3 .",
    "it is located 31.5 pc from the earth .",
    "figure 1 displays the habitable zone around hip 75458 .",
    "the habitable zone , moving outward , is expanding to an outer limit of 14 au and an inner limit at 7 au .",
    "habitable conditions at 7 au from the star have been encountered during about 10@xmath5 years , which is a reasonable , if optimistic , time for life to develop .",
    "the presence of a jupiter - like planet encourages one to imagine that other bodies ( perhaps even terrestrial ones ) could be orbiting this star .",
    "tables 2 - 4 display preliminary lists of evolved stars , and their characteristics , contained within a sphere of radius 30 pc around our sun .",
    "there about 94 sources of luminosity class iv ( table 2 ) , 44 sources of luminosity class iii ( table 3 ) and two sources of luminosity class ii ( table 4 ) . the luminosity class iii and iv ( respectively the giants and sub - giants classes ) result from low and intermediate mass stars having just left the main sequence in their evolution .",
    "luminosity class iv and iii stars are both of great interest . in the first case ,",
    "the habitable zone moves outward relatively slowly and allows , for stars with masses @xmath38 2 m@xmath3 , conditions that do not exclude the development of life . in the second case , after the first ascent along the rgb and the he flash ,",
    "the stars evolve into a stable phase of core he burning which is also favorable to the formation of life .",
    "approximately 30 to 60 percent of the luminosity class iv stars in table 3 are expected to be in this phase ( scalo & miller , 1979 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that luminosity class iv alone offers 94 nearby sources compared to the approximatly 1000 nearby main sequence stars ( of all spectral types ) .",
    "the ratio of all red giant stars ( tables 2 - 4 ) to the main sequence stars is thus about 14% , which at first seems high considering the local space density of all giant stars is about @xmath39 compared to main sequence stars .",
    "this value is based on main sequence and red giant star densities given in cox ( 2000 ) and neckel ( 1975 ) .",
    "however , a sample chosen based on a brightness or distance limit will select out a larger fraction than expected on the basis of volume estimates because the red giant stars are much brighter than the main sequence stars , and the increase should be proportional to the ratio of the luminosities , or roughly a factor of ten .",
    "thus , within 30 pc , a reasonable sample has been shown to exist .",
    "this sample allows us to consider evolved stars for the proposed future projects which may contribute to the understanding of the formation of life .",
    "the development of large filled - aperture space telescopes coupled to efficient coronagraphs and the development of space interferometers fed by large cooled telescopes , represent technological challenges that may be overcome in the next two decades . a first step in the development of large space telescopes like darwin and tpf are precursor concepts for coronagraphy ( e.g. eclipse , trauger et al .",
    "2003 ; epic , clampin et al . 2001 ) and precursor concepts for interferometry like the fksi mission concept ( fourier kelvin stellar interferometer mission - danchi et al 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "these instruments in the relatively near term could directly observe some types of extrasolar planets around stars .",
    "the difficulty of detecting a planet orbiting a red giant star and characterizing its atmospheric signatures lies in the very high contrast ratio between the planet and the star .",
    "for a 1.0 m@xmath3 star , due to the squared dependence between the habitable zone size and the stellar luminosity , the habitable zone size associated with a star of luminosity 4 l@xmath3 is of the order of 2 au , while for a star of luminosity 25 l@xmath3 , the corresponding size is 5 au , and , for 100 l@xmath3 , it is about 10 au .",
    "the contrast ratio required to observe a planet around a sub - giant or a red giant star increases by a factor of 4 to 100 ( range of luminosity corresponding to a reasonably long duration of the transit ) compared to that required to observe a planet around main - sequence ( fgk ) dwarf stars ( luminosity class v ) . on the other hand the angular resolution needed to separate the planet from the star",
    "is decreased due the increased size of the habitable zone . for hip 75458 ,",
    "the angular separation of the habitable zone is about 0.3 arcsec from the star .",
    "this separation is well within the resolution of filled - aperture space telescopes with diameters in the 5 - 10 meter range operating at visible and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we present a qualitative discussion below that shows how these factors approximately balance out in terms of the detectability of planets around evolved stars .",
    "a more detailed discussion is precluded at this time because the architectures for the tpf and darwin missions are still under development , and a detailed detectability study requires detailed knowledge of instrumental parameters , which are not available at present .",
    "we will present a more detailed treatment , based on simple model interferometers and coronagraphs in another paper . in the following discussion , for the purpose of developing an appreciation of the detection issues",
    ", we use a main sequence star at a reference distance of 10 pc , and compare that to a red giant star at 30 pc .    assuming the use of the fksi concept or of any other future nulling interferometer , three physical parameters representing the astrophysical source are of importance in order to estimate the potential of detection .",
    "these physical parameters are : ( 1 ) the angular distance between the planet and the star that has to be compared to the inner working angle ( iwa ) of the instrument ; ( 2 ) the contrast ratio between the planet and the star ; ( 3 ) and the stellar diameter , which affects the stellar leakage from a perfect optimum nulling . for a 1 m@xmath3 star , with the habitable zone varying between 2 and 15 au ( middle in the width ) , the corresponding stellar radius variations will be approximately between 2 and 15 r@xmath3 ( see figure 1(a ) and 1(b ) ; note this is an approximation because the effective temperature of the star varies also ) .",
    "we now discuss the relative difficulty of detecting a planet around red giant stars compared to main sequence stars .",
    "the reason for this comparison is that the designs for tpf and darwin will be based on the requirement to detect earth - like planets around the habitable zone of nearby main sequence ( f , g , k ) dwarf stars ( luminosity class v ) .",
    "thus we show that if tpf and darwin can detect earth - like planets around these stars , then these instruments will also be able to detect such planets around subgiant and red giant stars , i.e. , luminosity classes iv and iii .",
    "the inner working angle ( iwa ) of a coronagraph is :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and d are the wavelength of light and the diameter of the primary mirror of the telescope , respectively . the corresponding iwa for a simple nulling interferometer is :    @xmath42    where b is the baseline length and @xmath41 was defined previously .",
    "for the coronagraph systems , @xmath43 varies from approximately 0.32 arcsec for a 1.8 m primary mirror and a wavelength of 0.7 @xmath14 m as planned for the epic and eclipse missions , and is 0.096 arcsec for the 6 m longest dimension for the planned mirror for the coronagraphic version of tpf , now called tpf - c . despite the longer wavelength of light for the infrared interferometers , @xmath44 is typically much smaller than @xmath43 . for the fksi system , @xmath44 is 0.043 arcsec at a center wavelength of 5 @xmath14 m , while @xmath44 is 0.029 arcsec for a 35 m baseline on a structurally connected interferometer , or 0.017 arcsec for a 60 m baseline on a free flying interferometer , both assuming a center wavelength of 10 @xmath14 m .",
    "these iwas can now be compared to the angular size of the habitable zones for the two extreme cases for the red giant stars , namely 2 au and 15 au . at a reference distance of 10 pc",
    "the habitable zone is located at 0.20 arcsec from the star and 1.5 arcsec for the 2 au and 15 au cases , respectively . for a star at a reference distance of 30 pc ,",
    "the angular sizes are proportionally smaller , 0.067 arcsec and 0.50 arcsec , respectively .",
    "based on the iwas calculated here , the iwa of the small pathfinding coronagraphs like eclipse and epic will be adequate only for the nearest such stars , while the larger tpf - c has resolution sufficient to resolve the habitable zone for essentially all the red giant stars .",
    "the interferometer iwas are all smaller than the angular size of the habitable zone for all the cases discussed here , which means that this instrumental parameter is favorable for the detection of planets around red giant stars .",
    "the planet - star intensity contrast ratio in reflected light is approximately :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the planet and star intensities , respectively , while @xmath48 is the radius of the planet and @xmath49 is the distance from the star to the planet ( cf .",
    "charbonneau et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for infrared radiation emitted by the planet in thermal equilibrium with the star ,",
    "the planet - star intensity ratio is :    @xmath50\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the effective temperature of the star , and @xmath52 is the equilibrium temperature of the planet , as given by eqn .",
    "( 1 ) previously .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath53 are the radii of the planet and star , respectively .    in reflected light , the planet - star contrast ratio is reduced in comparison with main sequence stars because of the much larger planet - star separation , which amounts to factors of 4 to 225 for the 2 au and 15 au cases , respectively . in the thermal infrared ,",
    "the contrast ratios are reduced by factors of approximately 4 to 100 ( compared to those of main sequence stars ) as the radius of the star varies from about 2@xmath54 to 10@xmath54 over the course of the evolution of the star during the red giant phase .",
    "an additional consideration for the nulling interferometer is the stellar leakage mentioned previously . for a simple bracewell interferometer with a @xmath55 null ,",
    "the stellar leakage is given by :    @xmath56    thus the stellar leakage is proportional to the square of the angular size of the star divided by the angular resolution of the interferometer , or equivalently , the fringe spacing .",
    "this means the stellar leakage for a giant star of radius 2@xmath54 at 20 pc is the same as that of a 1@xmath54 main sequence star at 10 pc .",
    "however , the observable red giant stars are on average further away from our solar system than the main sequence stars , and the increase in the stellar leakage signal is expected to be at the low end of the range , or comparable to that of the main sequence stars .",
    "we can summarize our considerations of the detectability of these stars by noting that the problem is only moderately more difficult by a factor of 4 to 10 in terms of the star - planet contrast ratio , which is in the range of the variation expected for the most optimistic to the worst cases for the main sequence stars , given the variations in spectral type and planet size being considered for tpf / darwin .",
    "the inner working angles of the coronagraphs and interferometers are adequate for most of the stars in the tables in this paper .",
    "the stellar leakage is approximately equal or only modestly worse than that for main sequence stars since the giant stars are on average at larger distances from our solar system .",
    "more detailed studies of detectability issues are planned as more becomes known about the architectures for tpf and darwin .",
    "we have estimated the time transit of the habitable zone around evolved stars of initial mass 1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0 m@xmath3 from the time period after which a star moves off the main sequence until it reaches the point of the he flash .",
    "after the he flash , there is an additional potential phase for life during the period of quiescent core he burning prior to the star s ascent along the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the case of a 0.85 m@xmath3 star was not analyzed because the time for such a star to leave the main sequence is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "a simple hypothesis was used to estimate the inner and outer limits of the habitable zone , i.e. , a blackbody assumption and extrapolation of results presented in kasting et al .",
    "( 1993 ) defining the habitable zone limits around a solar type star . in our approximation",
    "the fact that the spectrum of the evolved star differs from the solar spectrum used in kasting et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is neglected .",
    "only the luminosity of the stars is considered , while the planet is assumed to be a greybody with perfect absorption at any wavelength .",
    "we conclude that life may exist around evolved stars of the sub - giant and red giant classes at several au from the stars .",
    "although the temporal evolution of a star is rapid after leaving the main sequence , the temporal transit of the habitable zone does not appear incompatible with the possible duration for the development of life .",
    "moreover , micro - organisms could be transported from a planet where life is ending to a planet where favorable illumination conditions for the rebirth of life are encountered .",
    "this type of mechanism may be unique , or may be encountered exclusively in the environment of evolved stars .",
    "we speculate also that around our sun , life may develop in the future at distances in the range 2 - 9 au .",
    "this is deduced from the the temporal transit of the habitable zone , which is estimated to be of the order of several 10@xmath4 years for a planet at 2 au and around 10@xmath5 years for a planet at 9 au .",
    "furthermore , after the sun ascends the red giant branch for the first time and undergoes the he flash , there is an additional long stable period of core he burning @xmath8 @xmath2 years during which life can evolve in the habitable zone , which now is from 7 to 22 au from the star .",
    "nearly 150 evolved stars ( sub - giants and red giants ) are within 30 pc of our solar system ( see the details in tables 2 - 4 ) . at the present time we do not know if life is common in our universe , or extremely rare , or even unique on earth . if future observing instruments allow the detection of signatures of life on various planets , then the observation of planets , possibly hosting life , around evolved stars may help to set some limit on the time required for life to develop . for example , if life is found on a planet inside a habitable zone transiting in 10@xmath21 years , this proves that life could develop within this period , setting a much smaller upper limit to the formation of life than presently known .",
    "in addition , if life appears to be common , another interesting case would be to find a planet containing liquid water within an habitable zone of rather fast transition ( like 10@xmath21 years ) with no signature of life .",
    "this case ( fast conditions of habitability ) could contribute to set new lower limits for the emergence of life .",
    "the environments of evolved stars may represent some interesting test cases .",
    "these test cases can consider the fundamental hypothesis that early life may have been connected to volcanic environments such as deep sea hydrothermal vents .",
    "thermophilic life may populate the ocean of superficially frozen planets .",
    "the expansion of the habitable zone around the star in evolution will change the habitable conditions of the surface of the planet by increasing its temperature , by increasing the rate of water evaporation and thus by triggering the hydrological cycles ( evaporation , clouds formation , rain process ) .",
    "if life was already present underneath the oceans , it could spread on the ground layer very fast .",
    "an interesting issue to tackle by observing a freshly habitable planet just entering a rapidly expanding habitable zone is the coupling between the development of life in the ocean and its development on the ground layer . life is known to have developed first in the earth s oceans . on other planets , if life as we know it is found , one may wonder : is the chlorophyl signature ( mostly representing the ground layer activity ) always encountered when bioatmospheric signatures ( related to the global activity : oceans + ground layer ) will be found ?",
    "a rapidly expanding habitable zone could help improve our understanding of the time delay coupling between these two different bio - environments : ocean and surface layer .",
    "we conclude that future observing programs focused on the search for planets with possible signatures of life should not omit the class of sub - giants and red giant stars .",
    "the study of objects of this class will further contribute to the understanding of the formation of life in the universe .",
    "filled - aperture space telescopes with diameters in the range of 5 to 10 meters operating at visible and near - infrared wavelengths and space - based mid - infrared interferometers with baselines in the range from 35 to 60 m , provide adequate resolution and sensitivity to detect earth - like planets around red giant stars .",

    "<S> we present some new ideas about the possibility of life developing around sub - giant and red giant stars . </S>",
    "<S> our study concerns the temporal evolution of the habitable zone . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the star and the habitable zone , as well as its width , increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the habitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence , sweeping a wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the asymptotic giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> presently there is no clear evidence as to when life actually formed on the earth , but recent isotopic data suggest life existed at least as early as @xmath0 years after the earth was formed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if life could form and evolve over time intervals from @xmath1 to @xmath2 years , then there could be habitable planets with life around red giant stars . </S>",
    "<S> for a 1 m@xmath3 star at the first stages of its post main - sequence evolution , the temporal transit of the habitable zone is estimated to be of several 10@xmath4 years at 2 au and around 10@xmath5 years at 9 au . under these circumstances life </S>",
    "<S> could develop at distances in the range 2 - 9 au in the environment of sub - giant or giant stars and in the far distant future in the environment of our own solar system . </S>",
    "<S> after a star completes its first ascent along the red giant branch and the he flash takes place , there is an additional stable period of quiescent he core burning during which there is another opportunity for life to develop . for a 1 m@xmath3 star </S>",
    "<S> there is an additional @xmath2 years with a stable habitable zone in the region from 7 to 22 au .    </S>",
    "<S> space astronomy missions , such as proposed for the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) and darwin , that focus on searches for signatures of life on extrasolar planets , should also consider the environments of sub - giants and red giant stars as potentially interesting sites for understanding the development of life . we performed a preliminary evaluation of the difficulty of interferometric observations of planets around red giant stars compared to a main sequence star environment . we show that pathfinder missions for tpf and darwin , such as eclipse and fksi , have sufficient angular resolution and sensitivity to search for habitable planets around some of the closest evolved stars of the sub - giant and red giant class . </S>"
