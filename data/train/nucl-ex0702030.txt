    "the recent observation of flavor oscillations in experiments with atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrinos has revealed a non - zero neutrino mass . being sensitive only to the differences of the neutrino masses , oscillation experiments yield no information about the absolute neutrino mass scale or about the nature of the neutrino , namely if it is a majorana ( @xmath6 ) or dirac ( @xmath7 ) particle . both aspects can be probed by neutrinoless double beta - decay ( 0@xmath8 ) , a process in which a nucleus of mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 transforms into a nucleus with the same mass and charge @xmath11 under the simultaneous emission of two electrons only .",
    "this process violates lepton number conservation by two units and is only possible if the neutrino is a massive majorana particle . while @xmath12-decay is not part of the standard model ( sm ) , it is predicted in many sm extensions , in particular in grand unified theories ( guts ) and supersymmetric ( susy ) models ( see the latest reviews on double beta decay  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath12-decay is sensitive to different theoretical parameters such as the neutrino mass , lepton violation constants , right - handed admixtures in the weak currents , the mass of a right - handed @xmath13 boson and/or other theoretical parameters , depending on the assumed model .",
    "even the non - observation of 0@xmath8-decay constrains the parameters of various sm extensions and narrows the variety of theoretical models . the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) which describes the nuclear transition of the decay is also relevant .",
    "if @xmath12-decay is observed , the accuracy of the derived theoretical parameters ( e.g. the effective majorana neutrino mass ) also depends on the accuracy of the nme calculation .",
    "the spread between the calculations of nmes performed with different methods is still large , and a massive effort is being devoted to this issue .",
    "the current theoretical status and the evidence of non - vanishing neutrino masses from neutrino oscillation experiments give a strong motivation for the experimental search for 0@xmath8-decay .",
    "+ since the first double beta - decay experiment in 1948  @xcite the @xmath12-decay process is still undetected . the current claim of discovery of @xmath12-decay of @xmath0ge with a half - life of @xmath14  y  @xcite ( 3  @xmath15-range ) has been widely discussed and still has to be confirmed by other experiments . today s",
    "best limits on the half - life are of the order of @xmath16  y for @xmath17te  @xcite and @xmath18xe  @xcite , and @xmath19  y for @xmath0ge  @xcite .",
    "for about ten other nuclei today s best limits on the half - life are of the order of @xmath20  y ( see compilations  @xcite ) .",
    "+ the neutrino accompanied double beta - decay ( @xmath21 ) is a nuclear transition @xmath22 which is accompanied by two electrons and two anti - neutrinos .",
    "such a decay conserves lepton number and is predicted by the sm . as it is a second - order weak process it has an extremely long half - life .",
    "the measurement of @xmath21-decay plays an important role in helping to fix the nuclear model parameters , in particular the particle - particle strength parameter , @xmath23 , in quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa)-models  @xcite .",
    "complementary information can be extracted from the measurement of the rate of @xmath21-decay to the excited states of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the probabilities of these transitions have a different dependence on @xmath23 than the transition to the ground state  @xcite .",
    "thus , different aspects of the nuclear models can be investigated .",
    "the observation of transitions to the excited states can help to constrain the parameter space in the calculation of nmes and could hence improve the accuracy of the calculation of the nme for the 0@xmath8-decay process .",
    "such an improvement is particularly interesting for @xmath0ge because of the recent claim of discovery of @xmath12-decay  @xcite .",
    "+ the refinement of experimental methods over the last twenty years resulted in the observation of @xmath21-decay .",
    "nowadays , @xmath21-decay has been observed in ten isotopes : @xmath24ca , @xmath0ge , @xmath25se , @xmath26zr , @xmath27mo , @xmath28cd , @xmath29te , @xmath17te , @xmath30nd , and @xmath31u , with half - lives in the range of @xmath32  y  @xcite .",
    "+ 2@xmath8-decay to excited states is phase - space suppressed . in only two cases the @xmath21-decay to the first excited @xmath33-state of the daughter nuclei has been observed , i.e. @xmath27mo with a half - life in the range of @xmath34  y  @xcite and @xmath30nd with a half - life of @xmath35  y  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper a study of the feasibility to detect the @xmath21-decay of @xmath0ge to the @xmath3-excited state of @xmath0se is presented .",

    "it is shown that the theoretical predictions of the half - life are within the experimental reach .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the germanium detector array , gerda  @xcite , is a new experiment which will search for @xmath12-decay of @xmath0ge .",

    "its main design feature is to operate germanium detectors directly immersed in liquid argon which serves as cooling medium and as a shield against external @xmath36-radiation simultaneously . with this setup a background index of @xmath37  counts/(kg@xmath38kev@xmath38y ) in the region of the @xmath39-value of @xmath40  kev",

    "the considered segmentation scheme of the detectors comprises a 3-fold segmentation in the height @xmath41 and a 6-fold segmentation in the azimuthal angle  @xmath42 .",
    "this scheme is denoted @xmath43 .",
    "each segment and the core are read out separately .",
    "the detectors will be @xmath44-type true coaxial germanium diodes .",
    "they are still under design but expected to have a mass of about 1.6  kg and to be 70  mm high and 75  mm in diameter .",

    "the most precise determination of the half - life was achieved in the heidelberg - moscow experiment which yielded a half - life of @xmath46  y  @xcite .",
    "the excited states of @xmath0se can also be populated .",

    "the present experimental limits on the half - lives of these transitions are also listed .",
    "the limits can not test the calculations so far .",
    "experimentally , the transition to the @xmath3-level is interesting due to the predicted half - life between @xmath4  y and @xmath5  y. transitions to the @xmath47-levels are suppressed by several orders of magnitude due to the additional change in spin by two units .",

    "four different models were used for the calculation , namely the hartree - fock - bogoliubov model ( hfb ) , the multiple commutator model ( mcm ) , the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and the shell model ( sm ) .",
