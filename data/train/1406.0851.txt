    "distant quasars at @xmath5 are uniquely able to facilitate studies of the universe in the first billion years after the big bang in two ways . first , since they are the most luminous non - transient objects , it is possible to measure the opacity of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) along the line - of - sight due to absorption of photons by neutral hydrogen and probe the epoch of reionization .",
    "second , by virtue of the fact that they already contain @xmath6 black holes , it is believed that quasars are located in the most overdense regions of the early universe ( e.g. , springel et al .  2005 ; sijacki , springel , & haehnelt 2009 ; costa et al .",

    "the field of ulas  j1120 + 0641 was observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the infrared channel of the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3/ir ) on board _ hst _ , for programme go-13039 .",
    "due to the low ecliptic latitude of the target , all observations were performed with the low - sky constraint , to reduce the sky background .",
    "the acs imaging was performed using the f814w filter and the wide field camera ( wfc ) and comprised 13 orbits , spread across five visits .",
    "four of these visits had their pointing centres sequentially offset by approximately 4arcsec to cover the gap between the two wfc ccds , and each visit consisted of six dithered exposures , two per orbit .",
    "a single exposure was taken in the final visit , to give a total exposure time of 28448s .",
    "the wfc3/ir imaging was undertaken as a 2@xmath292 mosaic across four visits . within each visit ,",
    "eight exposures in the f125w filter ( totalling 2116s ) were taken in the first orbit , while a further eight exposures in f105w ( totalling 4416s ) were split across the next two orbits .",
    "each set of eight exposures was made in two small box dithers , separated by an offset large enough to straddle the largest of the detector s bad pixel ` blobs ' .",
    "adjacent frames in the mosaic overlapped by 10arcsec to faciliate accurate registration .",
    "this resulted in the region around the quasar itself being observed for four times longer than most of the field .",
    "[ fig : exp_map ] shows the effective exposure map produced .",
    "the pipeline - processed images were combined using the _ astrodrizzle _ task in pyraf , initially using an output pixel size equal to the input pixel size . the initial combination of the wfc3/ir data revealed the presence of astrometric offsets between the visits , due to different guide stars .",
    "these offsets were measured by combining the f105w images in each visit separately and comparing the coordinates of objects in the overlap regions .",
    "the world coordinate systems in the image headers were then updated to correct for these offsets , and new mosaics in f105w and f125w were made .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in these corrections to be less than 10mas by summing the offsets around the four visits in the final mosaic , which should total zero .",
    "the combined , charge transfer efficiency - corrected acs image revealed no such offsets , but residual structure was seen in the background , with a peak - to - peak variation of 1.5per cent of the sky level .",
    "we investigated whether this was due to flatfielding errors by constructing a corrective flatfield from our pipelined images .",
    "all 25 acs images were scaled to the same sky level and this stack was median filtered before the small - scale structure was removed by estimating the variation in the background with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the individual images were then divided by a unity - normalized version of this frame and the new images run through _ astrodrizzle _ , but no improvement was seen .",
    "we also considered the possibility that the structure was due to the bias level by median - filtering the images after normalizing the sky levels by applying additive , rather than multiplicative , offsets but this had a detrimental effect on the final drizzled image .",
    "this residual structure was therefore removed from the final combined image using the sextractor - estimated background .",
    "new versions of the two wfc3/ir mosaics were produced by drizzling them onto images with the same pixel size ( 0.05arcsec ) and world coordinate system as the acs image , to improve the resolution and aid in the measurement of object colours .",
    "object positions were then compared in each of the three images and an offset of 90mas found between the acs and wfc3/ir images .",
    "this was corrected by altering the headers of the acs images and the stacked images were made a final time , with the offsets between object positions in the different filters found to be less than 20mas .",
    "the region of sky imaged in all three filters measures 210@xmath29225arcsec@xmath30 , corresponding to a projected linear dimension of approximately 1.1mpc ( proper ) at the redshift of ulas  j1120 + 0641 .",
    "the drizzled wfc3/ir images both have a point spread function fwhm of approximately 021 , while the acs image has a fwhm of @xmath31012 . a psf - matched version of the acs image was created by smoothing it with a gaussian filter , and photometric measurements were made from this smoothed image .",

    "we follow the method of szalay , connolly , & szokoly ( 1999 ) to detect objects , using a combined noise - weighted f105w+f125w image , referred to as the @xmath36 image .",
    "sextractor is used to find groups of contiguous pixels with values above the threshold @xmath37 where the probabilities of misclassifying sky and object pixels are equal . by counting the number of objects detected with negative fluxes in one or both filters",
    ", we can infer the level of contamination from spurious detections for different minimum size thresholds , and adopt a value of 14 as producing a catalogue that is 97per cent genuine , based on the number of detected sources with negative fluxes .",

    "we estimate the completeness of our catalogue by inserting artificial galaxies into the @xmath36 image and finding how many we recover .",

    "each galaxy has a srsic index drawn from a uniform distribution between 1.0 and 4.0 and is convolved with the point spread function measured from an isolated star .",
    "since the f105w image is deeper , and hence more heavily weighted in the construction of the @xmath36 image , the completeness is most sensitive to @xmath38 magnitude , with a secondary colour term . assuming a colour of @xmath39 ( see below ) , we obtain the points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : completeness ] , with 50per cent completess at @xmath40 ( approximately @xmath41 according to the @xmath24 luminosity function of mclure et al .",

    "we model the colours of stars and galaxies through our three filters , using the synphot package available in iraf , to determine the appropriate selection criteria for lbgs at @xmath24 .",
    "lbgs are modelled as 100-myr old bursts with a constant star - formation rate , using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , while quasar colours are determined using the composite spectrum of vanden berk et al .",

    "colours of a non - evolving elliptical galaxy are computed from the data of coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) , while the colours of late - type stars and brown dwarfs are derived from the spex prism spectral libraries .",
    "our selection criteria for lbgs , based on fig .  [ fig : iyj_model ] are : @xmath43    other _ hst _ searches for @xmath44 lbgs have taken advantage of extant ultra - deep optical imaging in several bluer filters where _ bona fide _ lbgs will have zero flux , and which can therefore be used to reduce the number of contaminants .",

    "colour diagrams , with a smaller separation between genuine @xmath24 lbgs and the key contaminants , which are @xmath1 galaxies , and less depth in the ` dropout ' filter .",

    "the detection of only three candidate @xmath24 galaxies in our field is surprising , given that we detected the same number in the smaller ( by a factor of 2.3 ) hudf after making the data comparable in depth .",
    "clearly there is no evidence for an overdensity of galaxies within 1mpc of the quasar , as might be expected if it is a signpost to a highly overdense region of the early universe .",
    "conversely , the apparent underdensity with respect to the hudf can not be due to the presence of the quasar since the radial extent of our survey is @xmath55mpc , based on the predicted redshift distribution given by our selection criteria and the redshift - dependent parametrization of the field luminosity function of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . using this luminosity function , and accounting for our selection function and incompleteness , we predict 5.8 @xmath24 galaxies in our field ( we predict 2.6 in the hudf ) , so there is a probability of 17per cent that we would find three or fewer such galaxies .",
    "images of the ulas  j1120 + 0641 field were taken with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ as part of a programme to characterize the quasar s spectral energy distribution .",
    "inspection of these revealed a source offset by @xmath56arcsec to the southwest of lbg2 , i.e. , away from the bright galaxy seen at the top of the postage stamps in fig .",

    "we assume that all the irac flux arises from lbg2 and supplement the _ hst _ photometry of the nearby galaxy with data from subaru / suprime - cam observations in the @xmath57 and @xmath58 filters . using simple stellar populations from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) attenuated by pei s ( 1992 ) parametrization of the small magellanic cloud extinction law",
    ", we obtain photometric redshifts of @xmath59 for lbg2 and @xmath60 for the nearby galaxy .",
    "there is a strong anti - correlation between redshift and extinction in the fit to lbg2 , so lower redshift solutions require more heavily - reddened populations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lbg2 ] ) .",
    "all fits to lbg2 predict @xmath61 , redder than observed , but consistent with the data within 3@xmath32 . these fits suggest that the irac photometry of lbg2 is contaminated by the nearby galaxy at a level of only a few per cent , which does not significantly affect the fit .",
    "we therefore conclude that lbg2 is most likely to be a galaxy at @xmath1 and the probability of our finding only two or fewer @xmath24 galaxies in our field is 7per cent .",
    "although ulas  j1120 + 0641 contains an extremely massive black hole that would imply a massive halo , the dynamical mass estimated by venemans et al .",
    "( 2012 ) from the [ c  ii ]  @xmath13158@xmath14 m line is @xmath62 , much smaller than measured for local black holes of similar mass .",
    "this supports the idea of willott et al.(2005 ) that the large scatter between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the halo in which it resides , coupled with the very steep halo mass function , makes it likely that high - redshift quasars do not sample the very massive haloes that their black hole masses would tend to suggest .",
    "given its depth , our data can not rule out an excess of sub-@xmath63 galaxies associated with the quasar .",

    "( 2005 ) found an excess of galaxy candidates around sdss  j1030 + 0524 despite only reaching @xmath64 , a full magnitude brighter than @xmath65 at @xmath21 , and our data would clearly be sensitive to an abundance of galaxies that bright .",
    "it is therefore worth questioning whether the presence of the quasar could have suppressed or delayed the formation of galaxies in its immediate vicinity .",
    "this is a particularly interesting question because the strong radiation field of the quasar has an effect on the ionization state of the gas .",
    "it has been suggested that the ` missing satellites ' problem can be explained if baryons do not cool and form stars when their dark matter haloes are below a certain mass at the time of reionization ( okamoto & frenk 2009 ) .",
    "since ulas  j1120 + 0641 has reionized its immediate surroundings earlier than the rest of the universe , haloes that could have formed stars elsewhere in the universe may have been unable to do so around the quasar .",
    "extrapolating the spectrum of mortlock et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as @xmath66 , we calculate a luminosity at the lyman limit of @xmath67whz@xmath27 , which would provide an isotropic ultraviolet intensity of @xmath68wm@xmath69hz@xmath27sr@xmath27 at a radial distance of 550kpc ( approximately the edge of our acs field of view ) , or @xmath70 using the terminology of kashikawa et al .",
    "their calculations suggest that haloes with virial masses @xmath71m@xmath72 could have their star formation significantly delayed ( by @xmath73myr ) if exposed to a radiation field of this strength for @xmath74myr ( the time between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , but more massive haloes would be unaffected .",
    "since ulas  j1120 + 0641 is estimated to be accreting at close to the eddington limit ( or even above it ; page et al .",
    "2014 ) , its luminosity in the past must have been lower .",
    "furthermore , the small size of the quasar s near zone suggests that the ionizing radiation has only been able to escape for a few myr ( bolton et al .",
    "2011 ) , so even @xmath77m@xmath72 haloes will have been unaffected . since an @xmath63 galaxy at @xmath24 has a stellar mass of @xmath78m@xmath72 ( mclure et al .",
    "2011 ) , it is implausible that formation of galaxies more massive than this could have been suppressed by the quasar .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility that ulas  j1120 + 0641 does not reside in a massive halo .",
    "this is the scenario proposed by fanidakis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who argue , based on their semi - analytic modelling , that the black holes in the most massive haloes have ended the phase where they are accreting cold gas and are highly luminous , and have already transitioned into the lower - luminosity feedback mode .",
    "this would imply that the most massive haloes at @xmath79 , where the galaxy overdensities lie , contain black holes as massive as that in ulas  j1120 + 0641 that grew to this mass more rapidly before shutting off .",
    "given the apparent need for prolonged super - eddington accretion to explain how this black hole reached its mass , such a model requires even more extreme accretion rates .",
    "it is worth noting that the first @xmath80m@xmath72 black holes in fanidakis et al.s ( 2012 ) model only appear at @xmath81 and , as a result , the model fails to reproduce the bright end of the observed quasar luminosity function at high redshift .",
    "it is therefore of questionable merit to use these models to predict the properties of the most extreme objects at @xmath82 and , while the lack of any bright galaxy excess may be consistent with the claims of fanidakis et al .  ( 2013 ) , we note that our results are also consistent with the work of overzier et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "[ fig : postages ] shows that the quasar is clearly detected in the f814w image , which covers the observed wavelength range @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and samples wavelengths blueward of those affected by the proximity effect of the quasar .",
    "the detection of the quasar in this filter therefore gives some information on the opacity of the igm over the redshift range @xmath85 .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio is only 1.8 in the 0.5-arcsecond diameter aperture through which the photometry of table  [ tab : photdata ] is measured , a 0.25-arcsecond diameter aperture on the unsmoothed image gives a magnitude of @xmath86 , after applying a 30per cent correction to account for lost flux , as determined by tinytim ( krist , hook & stoehr 2011 ) .",
    "an aperture of this size is warranted because the position of the quasar is accurately determined from the near - infrared imaging where it is bright .",
    "we nevertheless add a 10per cent flux uncertainty in quadrature , which accounts for a positional uncertainty of up to 50mas .",

    "all the flux in the f814w filter is from wavelengths just above the ly@xmath102 absorption edge , where the overall opacity is lowest , and therefore we are only sensitive to the opacity at redshifts slightly larger than @xmath103 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is where mortlock et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported the detection of flux in the quasar spectrum ( an additional , less significant , transmission spike at @xmath104 has subsequently been determined to not be real ) .",
    "however , this feature has a flux of @xmath105wm@xmath69 ( from a higher signal - to - noise ratio x - shooter spectrum ; george becker , private communication ) , which is only one - half of that needed to explain the f814w flux .",
    "this implies that there must be other regions along the line of sight where the transmission is non - zero but too low to be identified in the spectrum .",
    "a tighter constraint on the evolution of the opacity requires ultra - deep imaging in a narrower filter shortward of the quasar s ly@xmath3 emission .",

    "we identify three candidate @xmath24 galaxies from our _ hst _ imaging but conclude , on the basis of additional data , that only two are at this redshift , with the third being a source at @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the number of objects expected in a blank - field survey of the same area and depth , and therefore conclude that there is no excess of @xmath106 galaxies within 1mpc of the quasar .",
    "this can not be due to the influence of the quasar and we suggest that it is due to the small field of view of our images , as proposed by overzier et al.(2009 ) .",
    "the detection of the quasar in the f814w filter provides a constraint on the opacity of the igm at @xmath5 and we find that the model of becker et al .",
