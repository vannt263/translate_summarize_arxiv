    "at lhc , partons inside hadrons colliding at high energies may experience hard scatterings .",
    "this kind of interaction produces correlated showers of particles , that are experimentally identified as jets .",
    "we identify two type of partons as origins of such showers : quarks and gluons .",
    "the basic @xmath3 hard scattering processes are summarized in tab .",

    ". there are differences between quarks and gluons .",
    "these differences are theoretically embraced in the qcd casimir factors ( also known as color factors ) , which are proportional to the probability that a parton radiates a soft gluon .",
    "gluon s color factor ( @xmath10 ) is more than twice larger than that of a quark ( @xmath11 ) @xcite : @xmath12 which means that gluons are expected to form higher multiplicity jets with softer fragments distributed in a larger jet - cone .",
    "the differences between quark- and gluon - jets were tested extensively at lep in @xmath13 collisions@xcite and later at tevatron in @xmath14 collisions @xcite . in both experiments",
    "the above expectations have been fulfilled .",
    "furthermore , at lep the @xmath15 factors have been measured to be @xmath16 .",
    "these are consistent with the qcd predictions @xcite .    at lep",
    "it was also observed that gluon - jets on average produce more protons than quark - jets @xcite .",
    "of course , this finding has been included into the parameters of the fragmentation functions we use in monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this effect was not explained theoretically which opens possibilities for an investigation of this subject . in our previous",
    "work@xcite we studied particle production in gluon- and quark - enriched events . in this work , we designed an exercise , to see , what is the crucial factor in a mc model , that determines the @xmath0 ratio in a jet .",
    "is it the nature of the leading parton , or is it the way that a jet object fills the phase space with particles ?",
    "first step to be taken to answering this question , is to obtain samples of quark- and gluon - jets .",
    "there are efforts put into identifying jets as quarks and gluons at lhc .",
    "a thorough theoretical approach was taken in this matter in @xcite .",
    "the cited work aims at obtaining high - purity samples .",
    "we decided to take a rather different approach . in order to understand where the excess of protons in gluon - jets comes from and to answer the above question , we allow for contamination on purpose and observe how the final ratios change with respect to reference samples of mc quark- and gluon - jets .",
    "to summarize , the aim of our study is to see , how the observed differences between quark- and gluon - jets determine the final identified particle spectra within a widely used mc model .",
    "further we want to motivate a study on data , that divides the jets into two samples with either quark - like or gluon - like fragmentation . on comparison with reference samples of quark- and gluon - jets , we can conclude whether the resulting @xmath0 ratio is determined by the way the jet fragments or its origin .",
    "our aim is not to compare different mc models .",
    "instead we want to introduce a way to look at jets , that can shed more light on why gluon - jets produce more protons relative to quark - jets .",
    "if it is the origin that matters , the contamination will significantly affect the final particle spectra .",
    "if it is the fragmentation that is important , we should not observe difference within a certain fragmentation class , no matter the contamination .",
    "in this section we introduce a method to separate the jets into two fragmentation classes .",
    "we do this by looking at the energy distribution inside a jet and the respective number of tracks . to obtain the cuts we use 3jet and @xmath17jet events .",
    "we chose to work with these , since they provide samples of quark- and gluon - jets as they are their experimental sources .",
    "to separate our sample we use the sets of 3jet and @xmath17jet events obtained from simulated proton - proton(pp ) collisions at @xmath18 .",
    "this way we calibrate the cuts used to distinguish between quark - like and gluon - like jets . in order to obtain these sets",
    ", we generated @xmath19 events containing qcd hard processes and @xmath20 events containing direct - photon production .",
    "for our study we use @xmath21 mc generator@xcite , perugia 0 tune@xcite . to reconstruct jets we use the @xmath22 jet - finding algorithm @xcite with the following parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we have used the same set of kinematic cuts that are used by the alice collaboration at lhc .",
    "we have made such a decision , since we are interested to study identified particles inside jets and alice provides the necessary particle - identification capabilities to do so .",
    "further , we divided these samples into a sample containing 2 leading jets from 2 and 3jet events , a sample containing the least energetic jet from 3jet events and finally a sample of jets from @xmath17jet pairs . in order to obtain these samples , we imposed specific event - selection criteria .",

    "since we are applying cuts to the mixed qg(mc ) sample , before we compare it to the g(mc ) and q(mc ) , we need to see if the cuts themselves distort the studied ratio . in order to see this , from each g(mc ) and q(mc ) we select a subset of jets passing the selection criteria either for quark or gluon  like jets . from g(mc ) we select a subset of jets passing gluon  like criteria ( g(sel ) @xmath43 g(mc ) ) and from q(mc ) we select a subset of jets passing quark  like criteria ( q(sel ) @xmath43 q(mc ) ) .",
    "the comparison of these subsets with the inclusive g(mc ) and q(mc ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , in the middle .",
    "we see that , even though we did select a very narrow fragmentation  class of jets , the ratios are comparable with the mc samples .",
    "this already suggests that in pythia it is rather the origin than the fragmentation property of jet itself which determines the identified particle spectra inside a jet .",
    "finally , we proceed with the comparison of the q(sel ) and g(sel ) samples with the q(mc ) and g(mc ) .",
    "the comparison is shown in the very right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we observe that the gluon  like selection works fine , however , the selected quark  like jets have the ratio closer to g(mc ) than to q(mc ) .",
    "the reason lies in the high contamination of the q(sel ) with the real gluons .",
    "we are at energies where the processes producing two gluons in the final state of a hard - scattering have highest probability to occur @xcite and this gives them a high probability to pass our quark selection criteria , thus contaminating the quark  like jets .",
    "this supports our statement from previous paragraph , where we say that in the particular mc model which we use it is rather the origin of the jet than its fragmentation that determines the final particle spectra .",
    "in this work we have motivated a novel study of particle production in jets , based on their fragmentation , in order to complement other studies focusing on the origin of jets .",
    "we have concluded that despite the different fragmentation of jets originating from quarks or gluons , it has no influence on the final particle spectra inside these jets  within the used mc model . to see whether this statement holds , we suggest to proceed with similar study on experimental data , investigating the dependence of the @xmath0 ration inside jets on their fragmentation .",
