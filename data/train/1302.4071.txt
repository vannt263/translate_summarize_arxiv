    "in addition , researchers from different domains have given experimental evidence for the usefulness of fractional models by identifying their parameters and fractional orders .",

    "furthermore , no assumptions towards commensurability of fractional orders and system stability have to be made .    the basic idea of",
    "the method is to use an operational representation of a fractional model ( in the sense of mikusiski ) , usually described by an equation relating a ( known ) input and output , and to eliminate at least the unknown non - integer powers of @xmath0 , corresponding to fractional derivatives , by some algebraic manipulation . here",
    ", the focus lies on obtaining an operational equation , the expressions in which can easily be interpreted as functions of time .",
    "unknown quantities are calculated from relations involving only convolutions of known ( input and output ) signals .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , basic background regarding fractional derivatives and mikusiski s operational calculus is given in section  [ sec : defs ] .",
    "then , it is discussed how to obtain an equation suitable for the identification of fractional orders and model parameters in linear fractional models .",

    "based on the previous example and the discussions in section  [ sec : hom_gen ] for the homogeneous case the general approach for an equation is rather obvious .",
    "that is why only a sketch is given of how to obtain relations of the form .",
    "for both the riemann - liouville and the caputo definition the cases where initial conditions are eliminated and the one where they are identified are treated .",
    "henceforth , it is assumed that an upper bound of all unknown ( integer or fractional ) orders @xmath125 , @xmath58 is available .      for a known upper bound @xmath6 of the order of differentiation , the operational representation of ( corresponding to for homogeneous initial conditions ) can be written as @xmath126 where the coefficients @xmath127 , @xmath128 depend on initial values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and their derivatives as well as parameters @xmath67 , @xmath129 and @xmath68 , @xmath56 . applying @xmath130 to this equations",
