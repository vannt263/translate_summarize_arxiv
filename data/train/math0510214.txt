    "let @xmath2 be the mapping class group of the sphere with @xmath3 marked points , where we allow maps to permute the set of marked points . in @xcite gillette and van buskirk proved , using purely algebraic methods , the following theorem .",
    "@xmath2 contains an element of finite order @xmath4 if and only if @xmath4 divides one of @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .    later on the stronger version of this theorem",
    "was obtained as a by - product of certain considerations of harvey and maclachlan @xcite .",
    "every element of finite order in @xmath2 is contained in a maximal cyclic subgroup of order @xmath0 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and all such subgroups of the same order are conjugate .    in this paper",
    "we extend the above results .",

    "we obtain a description of conjugacy classes of maximal finite subgroups of the hyperelliptic mapping class group .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of the following theorem .",
    "finite subgroup @xmath7 of @xmath2 is a maximal finite subgroup of @xmath2 if and only if @xmath7 is isomorphic to one of the following :    1 .   the cyclic group @xmath9 if @xmath10 , 2 .",
    "the dihedral group @xmath11 3 .   the dihedral group @xmath12 if @xmath13 or @xmath14 , 4 .   the alternating group @xmath15 if @xmath16 5",
    "the symmetric group @xmath17 if @xmath18 6 .   the alternating group @xmath19",
    "if @xmath20    let @xmath7 be a finite subgroup of @xmath2 . by the positive solution to the nielsen realisation problem @xcite , we could assume that @xmath7 is a group of automorphisms of the riemann sphere @xmath21 .",
    "from the classification of such groups we have the following five possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath22 is generated by a rotation of order @xmath4 , 2 .",
    "@xmath23 is generated by two rotations of order @xmath4 and @xmath24 respectively , 3 .",
    "@xmath25 is the symmetry group of a cube ( octahedron ) , 4 .",
    "@xmath26 is the symmetry group of a dodecahedron ( icosahedron ) , and 5 .",
    "@xmath27 is the symmetry group of a tetrahedron .    in each case",
    "we shall find a maximal finite subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath2 containing @xmath7 .",
    "what is more , from the below analysis it will be clear how to construct each of maximal subgroups listed in the above theorem .    *",
    "1.*as a fundamental set for the action of a cyclic group @xmath7 we can choose the interior of the bigon @xmath28 with vertices in the south and north poles together with one of its edges ( figure 1 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    let @xmath29 be the set of these marked points @xmath30 , which have trivial stabiliser in @xmath7 and say it has @xmath31 elements . without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath7 acts on the unit sphere @xmath32 in @xmath33 by orthogonal rotations having the pair of poles as fixed points .",
    "we claim , that we can also assume that @xmath29 is a set of points on the equator which are vertices of a regular @xmath31-gon . to prove this",
    ", we will show how to `` move '' points of @xmath29 to such symmetric position without changing the geometry of the action of @xmath7 .",
    "the canonical projection @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is obtained from @xmath32 by removing the poles is a covering .",
    "since @xmath36 is homeomorphic to a two  punctured sphere , we could find a homeomorphism @xmath37 isotopic to the identity which maps @xmath38 onto @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a set of @xmath31 points on the equator which are vertices of a regular @xmath31-gon .",
    "now @xmath41 has a lifting and if we extend it to @xmath42 we see that @xmath43 acts on @xmath44 in such a way that @xmath40 is the set of marked points ( figure 1 ) . call this model for the action of @xmath7 _",
    "regular_.    we would like to point out that although two topological models for the action of @xmath7 ( with the set of marked points with trivial stabiliser equal to @xmath29 and @xmath40 respectively ) are models for the action of the same subgroup @xmath7 of @xmath2 , they could correspond to non isomorphic realisations of @xmath7 as an automorphism group of punctured riemann sphere .",
    "now , using regular model for the action of @xmath7 , it is obvious that @xmath7 is contained in the cyclic group @xmath45 of order  @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath46 or @xmath47 ( i.e. both poles are marked or not ) , @xmath45 is contained in the dihedral group @xmath48 generated by @xmath45 and a half turn leaving the equator invariant ; we fall into the second case .",
    "therefore we could assume that @xmath49 . to complete the case",
    "it is enough to prove that for @xmath10 , @xmath45 is a maximal subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "if a group @xmath50 acts on the sphere with @xmath0 marked points then at least one of them has trivial stabiliser ( since @xmath3 ) and its orbit has length @xmath4 , so @xmath51 .",
    "this proves that the action of @xmath9 can not be extended to the action of any cyclic group .",
    "similarly , if we have the action of a dihedral group @xmath52 then the stabiliser of at least one of the marked points has order one or two , so @xmath51 .",
    "what is more , there is no action by the group @xmath53 .",
    "the only cyclic subgroups of @xmath54 are , respectively , @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so we could restrict ourselves to the case @xmath58 .",
    "the maximal order of a stabiliser in @xmath15 is @xmath59 , so the minimal length of an orbit is @xmath60 and we see that the action of @xmath15 is possible only for @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , actions of @xmath17 and @xmath19 are possible only for @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "therefore the possible extension of the action of @xmath9 could exits only for @xmath64 .",
    "conversely if @xmath64 , using the above technique of obtaining regular action , we could extend action of @xmath65 to the action of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a dihedral group , then using similar methods such as in the case of cyclic groups we could construct a regular model for the action of @xmath7 , i.e. such that the action of the canonical cyclic subgroup @xmath66 of @xmath7 is regular and @xmath7 is generated by @xmath66 and a half turn , leaving the equator invariant .",
    "now it is clear that , depending on whether the poles are marked or not , this group is contained in @xmath67 or @xmath68 . using similar arguments like in the case of a cyclic group",
    ", we prove that @xmath69 for @xmath3 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 or @xmath14 are maximal . if @xmath70 then @xmath12 is a cyclic group and if @xmath64 or @xmath71 then we could extend the action of @xmath12 to the action of @xmath72 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "* 3.*if @xmath7 is the group of orientation preserving symmetries of a cube , then we have three orbits of points with nontrivial stabiliser in @xmath7 : the centres of faces , the centres of edges and the vertices with stabilisers of order @xmath73 and @xmath59 , respectively . since the length of an orbit is equal to the index of the stabiliser ,",
    "these orbits have lengths @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath76 be the number of marked points in a fixed fundamental set @xmath28 , which have trivial stabiliser .",
    "suppose that centres of faces , edges and vertices are marked points .",
    "then counting lengths of orbits , we have @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 . in similar way , according to whether centres of faces , edges or vertices are marked points or not , we obtain other possible values of @xmath76 ( table 1 ) .",
    ".possible values of @xmath76 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     observe that for the fixed number @xmath0 of distinguished points , only one of the above cases could occur .",
    "since there is no monomorphism of @xmath17 into @xmath79 , every such group is maximal . *",
    "4.*the case of the group of orientation preserving symmetries of a dodecahedron is fully analogous to the case of a cube and we obtain also eight possibilities ( table  1 ) .    *",
    "5.*if @xmath7 is the group of rotations of a regular tetrahedron , then by the same reasons as before , we have eight possibilities ( table  1 ) .",
    "observe that , since centres of faces are vertices of the dual tetrahedron , it is not difficult to show that groups in cases ( b ) , ( e ) and ( d ) , ( g ) are conjugate",
    ".    however the problem of maximality here is more involved due to the fact that there are natural monomorphisms of @xmath15 into @xmath17 and @xmath19 induced by embeddings of a tetrahedron into a cube and dodecahedron ( figure 2 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 has an extension @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath17 contains only one subgroup isomorphic to @xmath15 , if we realise @xmath45 as the group of rotations of a cube , we see that such extension could exist only when vertices and centres of faces of the tetrahedron ( defined as points of @xmath32 with stabiliser in @xmath7 of order @xmath59 ) are of the same type ( marked or not ) , because after extension they fall into one orbit . in particular in cases ( b )",
    ", ( d ) , ( e ) , ( g ) such extension could not exist .",
    "the same conclusion is true for the extension of @xmath7 to the action of @xmath19 , however now one has to be more careful , because @xmath19 contains five subgroups isomorphic to @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , using the same method as in the case of a cyclic group , it is easy to obtain in cases ( a ) , ( c ) , ( f ) , ( h ) extension of @xmath7 to the action of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a finite subgroup of @xmath2",
    ". from the previous section , follows that @xmath7 is isomorphic either to the cyclic group @xmath50 or to the dihedral group @xmath52 or to the symmetry group of a cube ( octahedron ) @xmath17 or the symmetry group of a dodecahedron ( icosahedron ) @xmath19 or else the symmetry group of a tetrahedron @xmath15 .",
    "we are now ready to extend this description to conjugacy classes .",
    "the set of conjugacy classes of subgroups isomorphic to @xmath7 has exactly two elements if @xmath81 with @xmath0 even or @xmath23 with @xmath82 or @xmath83 and one element for the remaining cases .",
    "a necessary condition for two subgroups @xmath84 of @xmath2 to be conjugate is that corresponding orbits of points with nontrivial stabiliser are of the same type , i.e. they are marked or not .",
    "counting for each possible type of the action the number of points of a fundamental set with trivial stabiliser one can see that for most cases different actions live on spheres with different numbers of distinguished points .",
    "the only exceptions are those of the first part of the theorem .",
    "if @xmath0 is even , then according to whether poles are marked or not , we have two non - conjugate actions of @xmath85 .",
    "now suppose @xmath82 .",
    "if we have an action of @xmath52 then there are two possibilities to distribute @xmath0 marked points : the first is that all marked points form one orbit of length @xmath86 , and the second when marked points form two orbits of order @xmath4 .",
    "this two possibilities give two non - conjugate actions of @xmath52 .",
    "similar situation holds for @xmath83 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be two isomorphic subgroups of @xmath2 with the same structure of orbits of points with nontrivial stabiliser . from the previous section it follows that there exist homeomorphisms @xmath89 for @xmath90 , such that @xmath91 acts on the sphere @xmath92 in a `` regular '' way ( i.e. @xmath93 , sets of marked points coincide , both groups act by orthogonal rotations and as a groups of isometries of @xmath32 , @xmath94 ) .",
    "let @xmath95 be the identity map .",
    "observe that @xmath96 is the identity as a map of @xmath32 , though as an element of @xmath2 it could permute marked points .",
    "so for @xmath97 we have @xmath98    two maximal finite subgroups of @xmath2 are conjugate if and only if they are isomorphic .",
    "suppose that a closed , connected orientable surface @xmath100 of genus @xmath101 is embedded in @xmath33 in such a manner that it is invariant under the half turn @xmath102 about the @xmath103-axis ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the hyperelliptic mapping class group @xmath99 is defined to be the centraliser of @xmath102 in the mapping class group of @xmath100 . by @xcite",
    "the quotient @xmath104 is isomorphic to the mapping class group @xmath105 of a sphere with @xmath106 marked points @xmath107 .",
    "for simplicity we will identify @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath108 be the canonical projection and @xmath109 be sets of maximal finite subgroups of @xmath99 and @xmath2 respectively",
    ".      observe that since @xmath102 is central in @xmath99 , it is contained in each maximal finite subgroup of @xmath99 , so @xmath96 is well defined .",
    "clearly @xmath96 is surjective , so let us prove that it is also injective . if @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 then @xmath115 .",
    "comparing orders , we obtain @xmath116 .",
