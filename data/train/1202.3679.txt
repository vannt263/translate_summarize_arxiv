    "two traditional probes of matter produced in heavy ion collisions are photons and dileptons@xcite-@xcite . photons and dileptons ,",
    "while produced since very early times in the collisions , propagate through the produced matter largely without interaction due to the small electromagnetic cross sections .",
    "therefore they provide unique access to the history of the quark gluon matter from early times , including the pre - equilibrium evolution .",
    "measurements of such photons and dileptons produced in collisions at rhic were first reported by the phenix experimental collaboration with quite surprising results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there is a large excess of photons in the transverse momentum range of @xmath0 for central gold - gold collisions .",
    "this excess far exceeds that due to direct photons and has been interpreted by the phenix collaboration to represent photons produced by a quark - gluon plasma with a temperature in excess of the deconfinement temperature .",
    "recently phenix has also measured the flow ( or more precisely the azimuthal anisotropy ) of such photons and found it to be sizable and exceeding the expectation from the hydrodynamic expansion of a thermalized quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "furthermore an excess of dileptons in the mass range @xmath1 is also present in the phenix data .",
    "hydrodynamic computations assuming a thermalized quark - gluon plasma fail to reproduce the magnitude of this dilepton excess .",
    "in addition , the slope of the @xmath2 distribution for such excessive dileptons in the relevant invariant mass bins is in the range of few hundred mev , much less than the corresponding mass of the dileptons : this fact is in sharp contrast with the typical kinematics @xmath3 if such pairs were to arise either from a thermal emission from a quark gluon plasma or from semi - hard processes .",
    "more recently the star experimental collaboration has searched for an excess of low to intermediate mass dileptons and the reported results are not in apparent accord with those of phenix @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the excess from star data is less than that seen in phenix and might be accommodated by a themalized quark - gluon plasma hypothesis . at the moment",
    "it is not clear yet whether the star measured enhancement of these pairs have their origin in low transverse momentum region .",
    "the alice collaboration has reported seeing an excess of photons for pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev in the same transverse momentum range as that of phenix , but have not yet reported results concerning flow@xcite .",
    "whether the ultimate origin of the  thermal photons \" and dilepton excess may be entirely attributed to a thermally equilibrated quark - gluon plasma with high temperature will remain to be seen , and a necessary first step would be the experimental clarification of the current tension between the phenix and star data .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to explore an alternative hypothesis based on possible important contribution to the electromagnetic emissions in the pre - equilibrium matter , the glasma .",
    "as shown in a series of recent studies  @xcite-@xcite , the glasma begins in the earliest stages of heavy ion collisions as an ensemble of longitudinal color electric and color magnetic lines of flux , and then decays into a far - from - equilibrium gluon - dominant matter .",
    "owing to the high occupancy of gluons that coherently amplifies scattering , the resulting glasma appears strongly interacting during the ( presumably long ) time toward thermalization even though the coupling is weak  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it may even develop a transient yet robust bose - einstein condensate of gluons as recently suggested in @xcite with supportive evidences from classical statistical lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "the name glasma implies its nature as the matter in between that of the color glass condensate  @xcite and that of the thermally equilibrated quark - gluon plasma , which can be thought of as a strongly interacting but unequilibrated form of quark - gluon plasma .    in this paper",
    ", we will take a first step to make rough estimates of the electromagnetic emission properties of this glasma .",
    "while our estimates are not as detailed as those that exist for the thermalized quark - gluon plasma from years of efforts , we will find nevertheless , that the glasma appears to have the correct qualitative and semi - quantitative features to explain some interesting aspects of the phenix photons and dileptons data that would otherwise be difficult to understand . in this paper",
    "a number of approximations will be made due to our currently incomplete knowledge of the glasma .",
    "our estimates will mostly focus on the dependence of various distributions upon centrality , transverse momentum and mass .",
    "the overall normalization of these effects is not determined within our current crude approximations but rather fixed from data .",
    "this may not be surprising by recalling that determining normalization of rates was very difficult for the thermalized quark - gluon plasma and involved much effort over many years .",
    "a further weakness of our present analysis is that we will treat only 1 + 1 dimensional expansion of the glasma and as such can not estimate transverse flow effects .",
    "in addition , we are aware of the situation that the existence of a transient bose condensate in the glasma is still under intensive ongoing investigations and so far neither fully established nor ruled out as consequence of the complicated dynamics in the glasma , and thus the conclusions concerning dileptons may be correspondingly weakened .",
    "finally one should be cautious about the current dispute on data for dileptons between star and phenix .",
    "given all these uncertainties , what do we learn from this analysis ?",
    "for the photons :    * the glasma hypothesis yields a simple and robust estimate for the dependence of photon production on centrality as a consequence of geometric scaling of the emission amplitudes .",
    "as will be shown , the phenix photon data very well satisfies such geometric scaling .",
    "* the glasma hypothesis can generate the correct shape of the transverse momentum spectrum . * the photon flow , while not computable in our current approach ,",
    "may arise naturally from the pre - equilibrium flow patterns that can be generated in glasma , earlier than is usually assumed for the initial conditions for the thermalized qgp . in the glasma the quarks become substantial only till relatively late times of the evolution , thus allowing flow to establish .",
    "for the dileptons :    * the transverse momentum and mass spectra can be described within the glasma hypothesis .",
    "*   the observation by phenix that the low to intermediate mass enhancement arises from anomalously small transverse momentum region has a natural interpretation as emissions from a condensate which in a fluid at rest produces particles with zero transverse momentum . *",
    "geometric scaling is predicted for the centrality dependence of the dilepton spectra .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the second section we will review those recently developed results for the glasma which will be needed to estimate the photon and dilepton rates ; in the third section , we will then use these results to estimate the photon and dilepton rates from glasma emissions , accounting for the time evolution of the glasma ; in the fourth section , we compare our results with the data from the phenix collaboration ; finally in the last section , we will draw our conclusions and end by discussing a number of caveats in our present estimates .",
    "in this section , we briefly review a recently proposed scenario for the thermalization process in the glasma .",
    "the results relevant to our discussion of electromagnetic production will be presented , while all the details can be readily found in @xcite .    during the earliest stage of the evolution of the glasma , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gluon saturation momentum , the gluonic degrees of freedom are largely coherent longitudinal color electric and color magnetic fields .",
    "gluons , in the sense of particles , are being produced from the classical evolution of color electric and color magnetic fields , and these gluons produce a distribution that is approximately isotropic in momentum space , due to plasma instabilities .",
    "not many quarks are present since they are produced by quantum fluctuations in the gluon field , and this is suppressed by a power of @xmath6 .",
    "the qcd coupling constant is small if the gluon saturation momentum is large compared to the qcd scale , which we shall assume .",
    "we shall not discuss the photons and dileptons produced at this earliest time .",
    "instead , we will concentrate on the time interval @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the thermalization time . during this time interval ,",
    "the quark density increases to a value of the order of the gluon density , and is no longer suppressed .",
    "since electromagnetic particle production ultimately arises from the electromagnetic charges of quarks , it is plausible that the production for @xmath9 might not be important .",
    "further , we will concentrate on transverse momentum and mass scales where we expect that the effects of the evolution to a thermalized distribution are enhanced .",
    "we assume the gluon distribution function is of the form @xmath10 in this equation , @xmath11 is the gluon momentum .",
    "@xmath12 is the momentum scale at which the gluons are maximally coherent and is time dependent . at the earliest times @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a time dependent ultraviolet cutoff , which at the earliest time coincides with @xmath12 i.e. @xmath15 . the scale @xmath14 however continuously separates from @xmath12 during the course of thermalization , and upon equilibration becomes the initial temperature for the quark - gluon plasma @xmath16 .",
    "the soft scale @xmath12 , on the other hand , becomes the non - perturbative `` magnetic scale '' @xcite in the thermalized plasma @xmath17 .",
    "the thermalization is therefore accomplished by splitting apart these initially overlapping momentum scales by @xmath6 parametrically , and the corresponding time is determined by the following requirement @xmath18 to achieve such separation takes parametrically long time in the very high energy limit and could take considerable time even at the rhic energy .",
    "a very important consequence of the saturation is that the phase space for the gluons is initially over - occupied @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number density of gluons , and @xmath21 is the energy density in the gluons . for a thermally equilibrated bose system ,",
    "it is necessary that this ratio be less than a number of the order 1 .",
    "it is therefore plausible that in addition to the gluons , a bose - einstein condensate could be developed with time by `` absorbing '' the large number of excessive gluons into zero momentum state ( provided that the inelastic processes are not fast enough to sufficiently reduce the number of gluons prior to thermalization ) .",
    "such a condensate would be of the form @xmath22 the condensate can be thought of as many gluons compressed into a color singlet and spin singlet configuration that are highly coherent and have zero momentum .",
    "we expect that the effective masses of the gluons in the condensate should be of the order of the debye scale , which is @xmath23 this is because when the condensate decays it must produce real time excitations and the minimum mass scale for such excitations is the debye mass",
    ". the debye mass will also act as an infrared cutoff in various dynamical processes .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the time evolution is dominated by the gluon density , and that there may be some fixed asymmetry between the typical transverse and longitudinal momentum scales characterized by a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is defined in terms of the longitudinal pressure @xmath25 where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to the free - streaming ( thus maximal anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse pressure ) and the isotropic expansion , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of the scales @xmath12 and @xmath14 were found to be @xmath29 and @xmath30 this can be translated into the gluon density and the debye mass as @xmath31 and @xmath32 the thermalization time is given by @xmath33    it is difficult to determine the time evolution of the gluon condensate density without fully addressing the inelastic processes .",
    "nevertheless one may assume an approximation transport equation of the form @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the universal scattering time for the glasma and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants of order 1 .",
    "the first term represents the decay of condensate due to inelastic processes , while the second term reflects the `` feeding '' into condensate from the over - occupied gluons .",
    "( this equation is for illustration shown for a non - expanding medium , but analogous results are easy to derive for an expanding medium . ) under the above approximation it can be deduced that either the condensate decreases more slowly than the gluon density if @xmath38 , or the condensate density stays at the order of the gluon density if @xmath39 . in either case one has @xmath40 , and for simplicity we will use the following assumption for later discussions : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of order 1 .    finally , to complete our description , we need the quark number density that is @xmath43 so that the quark number density is @xmath44 at the earliest times @xmath45 , but at late time the two densities approach each other , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "now let us estimate the rate of photon production from the glasma . recall that the quark number density , up to an overall constant is identical to that for the quark number density in a quark gluon plasma with the replacement @xmath47 .",
    "the computations of the rate for photon production at finite temperature are reviewed in ref .",
    "for thermal emission from a quark gluon plasma in a fixed box , the result is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a slowly varying function of @xmath50 of the order one .",
    "the factor of @xmath6 arises from the interaction of quarks with the medium in the photon production process .",
    "( this formula and the ones that follow are evaluated in the local rest frame of the fluid , and require generalization for use in a boosted frame . )    in the glasma , this is compensated for by the high gluon density @xmath51 associated with the coherence of the glasma . for glasma emission , we shall use a simplified form of this equation , @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is a function of order one that cuts off when then energy of the photon is of the order of the uv cutoff scale @xmath14 .",
    "this form follows from dimensional reasoning , and the fact that the overall rate must be proportional to the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the factor of @xmath14 is analogous to the temperature factor for thermal emissions .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath54 relative to the naive generalized thermal formula .",
    "this factor arises because one of the external legs of the diagram that induces photon emissions couples to a coherent glasma gluon and this has a distribution function proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the factor of @xmath56 occurs because @xmath14 is the largest momentum scale in the problem and quarks always have a typical momentum scale of order @xmath14 .",
    "whether the gluon arises from thermal gluons or from the gluon condensate is not important , since we will assume the density of gluons and the density of the condensate are the same .",
    "this will only affect the external line factors but not the dependence of @xmath56 , because it is the largest momentum scale , i.e. that of the quarks , that determines such dependence .",
    "note that at thermalization when @xmath57 , this formula reduces to that for thermal emission . a heurisic derivation of eq .",
    "( [ photratefb ] ) is given in the paragraph [ apphot ] in the appendix .    to obtain the overall rate ,",
    "we need to integrate over longitudinal coordinates .",
    "we assume that the early time expansion is purely longitudinal , and that in the integration the space - time rapidity is strongly correlated with that of the momentum space - rapidity .",
    "we then have that @xmath58    using the result of the previous section for the time dependence of the scales @xmath14 and @xmath12 , we have @xmath59 the constant @xmath60 is of order 1 .",
    "+ doing the integration over @xmath14 in eqn.([rate ] ) , we find that @xmath61    now integrating over @xmath62 , and identifying the overlap cross section as proportional to the number of participants , we finally obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the factor of @xmath65 arises because the number of participants in a collision proportional to the nuclear volume @xmath66 here @xmath67 is a constant with dimensions of a length .",
    "it should be of order @xmath68 , but can not be determined precisely due to the crude approximations made .",
    "the power of @xmath69 ranges from @xmath70 with the two limits @xmath71 and @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath27(maximal anisotropy ) and @xmath28 ( isotropic expansion ) respectively .",
    "note that in this formula , once the power of @xmath2 has been determined from experiment , then using that @xmath73 , we have that the cross section scales as @xmath74 . this is a very rapid dependence on the number of participants .",
    "it is important to note that in the derivation of this result , we have assumed that the largest part of the contribution when integrating over @xmath14 does not come from the end points of the integration .",
    "if the end points become important , then the physics either from the earliest times ( hard processes ) or from the thermalized quark gluon plasma will become important . for the case of a quark gluon plasma ,",
    "the dominant region of integration is @xmath75 . the smallest possible value for @xmath14 would be of the order of the qcd transition temperature , and at rhic energies the highest possible value for @xmath14 shall be around @xmath76 .",
    "these considerations are therefore valid at best for photon production in the range of @xmath77 .",
    "the analysis of dilepton production is more complicated because there are two sources of dileptons .",
    "the first is due to annihilation of quarks in the glasma . for this contribution",
    ", the rate can be determined by dimensional reasoning to be ) see paragraph [ apdil ] in the appendix . ]",
    "@xmath78 the evaluation of this contribution follows as above and gives @xmath79 with @xmath80 taking values @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , the derivation of this result requires very massive dileptons .",
    "analogous to the limits on @xmath2 for direct photon production , such contribution would be in the mass range greater than @xmath83 in which a variety of other processes such as charm particle decays would obscure a drell - yan signal .",
    "also note that the most interesting `` excess '' seen in the rhic data appears in the range between a few hundred @xmath84 and about @xmath83 .",
    "let us however consider another process .",
    "this process is the annihilation of gluons into a quark loop from which the quarks then subsequently decay into a virtual photon and eventually the dilepton : see the illustration in the fig.[fig : threegluoni ] .",
    "such a virtual process is naively suppressed by factors of @xmath6 . here",
    "however , the gluons arise from a highly coherent condensate , and the corresponding factors of @xmath6 are compensated by inverse factors @xmath85 from the coherence of the condensate . in other words ,",
    "the usual power counting for diagrams in terms of @xmath6 has to be changed when the coherent condensate with high occupation is present .",
    "this annihilation process from a condensate has a distinctive feature .",
    "the condensate gluons have nearly zero total momentum in a co - moving frame .",
    "all of the gluon momentum is acquired by collective flow , and hence the produced dileptons will have a small transverse momentum which could be much smaller compared with the pair mass . in contrast , for usual thermal production processes as well as hard particle production processes , the typical transverse momentum of the produced pair is of the order of the dilepton mass .    [ 1.0 ]     here we estimate the rate for the three - gluon decay of the condensate into a dilepton . on dimensional grounds , we expect that @xmath86 we are assuming the condensate density is of the order of the gluon number density as in eq.([eqn_ng_nc ] ) .",
    "we are also assuming that the typical scale for the energy of gluons in the condensate is of order the debye mass .",
    "it is also implicitly assumed that the condensate is unstable with respect to decay but gets stabilized by processes that build up the condensate due to the over - occupation of gluonic states .",
    "note that in the scaling glasma we have @xmath87 .",
    "note that due to the external gluon lines , there is a correction to the result in eq.([eqn_pair ] ) on the order of @xmath88 .",
    "the coupling @xmath6 from each leg will be canceled by the high density @xmath85 from each leg and at the end one obtains an overall multiplicative factor @xmath89 .",
    "when the integration over time is concerted into that of factors of mass , we get the following result @xmath90 where the exponent now becomes @xmath91 given by @xmath92 it is valued in the range @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath94 for maximal anisotropy and @xmath28 for isotropic expansion .    because the time evolution of the debye mass is much more rapid than is that for the ultra - violet cutoff scale @xmath14 , we expect that the range where this formula applies is in a range of masses significantly smaller than is the case of the photons , and drell - yan emission for quarks .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that this formula works in the range somewhat below @xmath95 but may cut off at some small mass of order few hundred @xmath96 .",
    "a detailed computation of the rate and determination of behavior near such a cutoff would be useful , since the cutoff is a measure of the temperature at which the condensate disappears , which is presumably the thermalization temperature .",
    "the results we present above for three - gluon annihilation into a quark loop can and should be corrected for multiple gluon annihilation . for such soft gluon attachments",
    ", we believe these effects can , with some work , be analytically summed .",
    "since more gluon attachments will increase the powers of time - dependence on the external legs , this will lead to a steepening of the dependence on the mass scale .",
    "the generic feature of geometrical scaling , that the distribution is a function of the form @xmath97 will not be modified , as this follows entirely from dimensional reasoning .",
    "the distribution from the condensate will also come from small momentum .",
    "we see that generic features of the distribution that we wish to extract will remain , although the shape of the curve in @xmath98 would have significant modification . as a practical matter",
    ", one needs to do the integration over the space - time history much more accurately for the mass range seen at rhic energies , since this range extends to rather low mass values .",
    "we end by discussing a few theoretical issues in the above estimation . with the crude approximation above",
    ", we have estimated the contribution from one flavor of massless quark .",
    "the amplitude for this contribution is proportional to the quark charge .",
    "if we have multiple massless flavors , we have it proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "for the three light flavors @xmath100 , this sum would vanish provided they are strictly degenerate in mass .",
    "a non - vanishing contribution would survive when the mass for the strange quark becomes relevant ( e.g. when the scales are low ) , and/or a contribution from the charm quark becomes relevant ( e.g. when the scales are high ) .",
    "which contribution is dominant depends upon the scale of the dilepton mass .",
    "these effects will generate an overall suppression and may introduce a non - trivial shape into the mass distribution . for example , the charm quark contribution could make the distribution harder i.e. less steep .",
    "another concern is related to the spin states of the gluons in the condensate .",
    "the diagram in fig.[fig : threegluoni ] computes essentially the em vector current correlator , and since the condensate gluons have zero spatial momentum the spatial structure will have to arise from the gluon spin indices . a nonzero contribution from the diagram is obtained if the gluon spin states are either incoherent and trivially averaged as is the case in thermal qgp ( which we think shall be the case ) or are coherently in a uniform spin orientation ( thus breaking spatial isotropy ) .",
    "these issues would require further works for clarification .",
    "in this section we will present phenomenological formulae for electromagnetic emissions that follow from the theoretical results described in the previous sections , and compare the results with the experimental data on photons and dileptons from the phenix collaboration .",
    "we begin with eq.@xmath101 for the photon yield @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "the power of @xmath104 ranges from @xmath105 ( corresponding to @xmath106 , respectively ) .",

    "we will examine this range of parameters and find the best fitting results .",
    "based on the above , we will use the following phenomenological formulae for parameterizing the contribution from glasma evolution to the photon production : @xmath113^{\\eta/2 } \\over k_{t}^{\\,\\eta\\,(1+\\lambda/2 ) } } \\ , .",

    "an issue we can not address at present is the fact that the photon excess measured at phenix has reasonably large @xmath167 @xcite since in our computations we can not account for the effects of transverse expansion .",
    "although we expect sizable flow to be developed in the glasma , it remains an issue to be seen if it is sufficient to explains the data , or if there is new physics involved@xcite .",

    "it shall be emphasized that in our model the dileptons generated from the glasma shall have their mass bounded by the in - medium mass of gluons in the glasma , and therefore our formula shall not be applied to too small values for the pair mass .",
    "accordingly , we focus on comparison with data in a mass regime @xmath178 . since the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath91 ( determined by @xmath24 )",
    "are well constrained from the photon fitting , we will use those optimal values implied by the photon data also for the dilepton fitting , i.e. @xmath158 and @xmath179 ( corresponding to @xmath180 ) .    for each mass bin of the dilepton yield ,",
    "the dashed curves represent the background yield formed by contributions of the hadronic decay cocktail and charmed mesons .",
    "for the four higher mass bins relevant to the production from the glamsa , we add on top of the background the additional contribution given by eq.([eqn_dilep2 ] ) : the results for the total yield are represented by the colorful bands where the upper and lower boundary curves for each band correspond to the results with the parameter @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively . for the @xmath2 width",

    "it is a phenomenological event generator that allows to simulate the phase - space distribution of all relevant sources of electrons , electron pairs and the decay of these sources .",

    "it is assumed that all the mesons have a constant rapidity density in the range @xmath196 , and a uniform distribution in azimuthal angle . by this way we obtain the summed up hadronic cocktail consisted of dileptons from all these mesons .",
    "the next step is to add the charm contribution to the cocktail ( the same procedure was applied for computations shown in fig.[dileptons ] as well ) .",
    "then we treat the glasma as a source of pair generation , which can be incorporated into exodus using eq.([eqn_dilep1 ] ) as a general formula for the pair production .",

    "the conclusion of this paper is that the photons and dileptons data measured at phenix may be consistent with a scenario that assumes important contribution to the electromagnetic production during the pre - equilibrium stage based on the glasma hypothesis with the existence of a condensate .",
    "there are of course alternative explanations .",
    "we briefly outline below some of the places where alternative hypothesis may be viable or attractive and where further investigations would be desired .",
    "first , we discuss the results for the photon production .",
    "the features that can be explained naturally within the glasma scenario include the shape of the @xmath2 spectrum as well as its centrality dependence .",
    "however :    * the photon @xmath2 spectrum can be explained by hydrodynamic expansion of a very hot quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the problem with that explanation is that it requires thermalization at quite early times ( such that the system is still hot ) , while there is now accumulating evidences that the system at so early a stage is more of a glasma . *",
    "the photon spectrum satisfies geometric scaling across centrality .",
    "this arises naturally from the glasma approach .",
    "nevertheless such scaling properties are characteristic of hadronic processes , and can be built into hydrodynamic computations by choice of glasma - like initial conditions . *",
    "the photon spectrum has large elliptic flow ( i.e. significant azimuthal anisotropy ) .",
    "this feature poses serious and generic difficulty for both a thermalized qgp and a glasma description if one tries to generate the flow during the early time expansion .",
    "the problem might be a little less severe for the glasma as the quarks become substantial in glasma only toward the later stage in the lifetime of the glasma .",
    "one may presumably expect that either there are yet - to - be - understood generation of pre - equilibrium flow at early times , or the source of the photons might be from some entirely different source .",
    "let us then turn to the dilepton production . by including the glasma contribution on top of the conventional `` cocktail '' production ,",
    "a good description of the mass and @xmath2 dependence of the dilepton spectrum has been achieved .",
    "in particular the excess dominantly at small @xmath2 may be linked with production from the bose condensate in the glasma . however :    * so far a consensus is lacking between the phenix and star experiments over the magnitude of the dilepton enhancement as well as on the dominant @xmath2 range of such enhancement . in addition , the largest barrier to a description of this enhancement in terms of the thermal qgp production is that it can not reproduce the magnitude of the effect . in the present glasma estimates ,",
    "the magnitude of the effect is not computed . *",
    "even if it could be experimentally settled that the source of the dilepton excess arises from low @xmath2 , it could be that such low @xmath2 dileptons may arise via a similar mechanism from some other sort of condensate not associated with the glasma .",
    "in addition , the existence and properties of a transient bose condensate in the glasma are still under intensive scrutiny . *",
    "the glasma hypothesis predicts geometric scaling of the dilpton spectrum , but a critical verification of such predictions will have to wait for sufficient data in the future . +    bearing all these caveats in mind ,",
    "we emphasize again the valuable lessons from this study as we have already listed in the introduction .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the presented study of the glasma scenario here is not intended to draw any conclusion , on the basis of a comparison with phenix data , regarding whether the glasma or the thermalized quark - gluon plasma scenario is favored .",
    "instead , the primary point is a theoretically well motivated expectation , i.e. for a considerable window in the early time evolution of the system , the matter produced in heavy ion collisions will be better described by a thermalizing glasma rather than a thermalized quark - gluon plasma .",
    "based on that expectation we have set out in this paper to examine its implications for the photon and dilepton production , and have found a plausible phenomenological description of data .",
    "admittedly like all such first attempts , there is much uncertainty .",
    "one however may remember the significant time and efforts it took to refine the thermal photon and dilepton computations and to achieve some consensus over theoretical predictions .",
    "in reflection of this history , we hope that the first small steps taken here will lead toward a deeper understanding of what we consider to be an important question : + _ when and for what phenomena is the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma better described as a thermalized quark - gluon plasma or as a thermalizing glasma ? _",
