    "since its discovery by von klitzing et al.@xcite , the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is a fascinating phenomenon for physicists , especially for those with a close connection to fundamental physics . among logics to explain quantization of hall conductance , one theory utilizes the theory of fiber bundles@xcite .",
    "although it is natural to connect hall conductance which is represented by integers in units of @xmath0 with the integration of the chern class in a cycle with integer coefficient being an integer , it can not be grounds for being integers .",
    "in fact , our numerical calculation of hall conductance does not become an integer in units of @xmath0 , which means the failure of the argument . a brief explanation of the weakness of the argument follows .",
    "our first consideration is the solution of bloch electrons in a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the flux quantum , s is the size of a unit cell , and p and q are positive intergers which are mutually prime .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the electron mass , the electron charge , the momentum operator , a vector potential , and a periodic potential , respectively .",
    "we take the landau gauge @xmath9 .",
    "we present here briefly a calculation method which enables band calculation in a magnetic field .",
    "+ the followings are magnetic translation operators .",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are primitive translation vectors of a lattice , and they form an angle @xmath13 .",
    "these operators commute with a hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "they become commutative @xcitewhen the vectors are enlarged from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "then , we shall produce from the landau level wave functions which satisfy periodic boundary condition in terms of the magnetic translation operators , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are periodicity of the system , and @xmath19 is assumed to be a multiple of @xmath21 . on these periodic fuctions , the magnetic translation operators form a representation of abelian magnetic translation group ( mtg ) which is isomorphic to @xmath22 .",
    "finally , multiplying a projection operator of an irreducible representation of mtg onto the obtained wave functions , we obtain : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetic length , @xmath28 .",
    "the wave function of equation ( [ wf ] ) satisfies @xmath29 ,    @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 are the wave vectors in the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "it also satisfies @xmath34 because a periodic potential is invariant under the magnetic translation operations , the representation matrix in terms of the basis ( [ wf ] ) is block diagonalized .",
    "the matrix elements of a periodic potential is given in appendix a.    note that inter landau level index @xmath4 varies as @xmath35 ; that is , each landau level is p - fold degenerated and splits into p bands in general when a periodic potential is applied .",
    "this is often misunderstood as q - fold as douglas hofstadter himself did@xcite .",
    "although a similar method was given by springsguth et al.@xcite , the reason why the method is justified is not presented and is different from ours . although subtlety of our method is the periodic boundary condition in the presence of a magnetic field , this subtlety comes from validity of using periodic boundary condition to analyze a solid which is not periodic actually .",
    "moreover , people who use tight binding model with peierls - onsagar substitution can not criticize our method because phase factors are the same as them .",
    "note that , of course , hopping integral changes in general as magnetic field strength varies .",
    "our method shows hofstadter butterfly structure as well ( fig.1 ) . in fig.1 ,",
    "as mentioned above , the p - fold degenerated lowest flat landau level splits into p distinct bands .",
    "where @xmath36 .",
    "the lattice is square with the lattice constant @xmath37 .",
    "calculation was done up to @xmath38 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath39 .",
    "the vertical axis is @xmath40 .",
    "it can be seen that the broadening of the lowest landau level due to the periodic potential gets larger as magnetic field strength tends to infinity.,width=453 ]     +",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) regardless of its potential , the kubo formula for hall conductance is    @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "when the fermi level lies in a gap between subbands of the split lowest landau level , the calculation of hall conductance corresponds to the calculation ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "kohmoto claims that this quantitiy is a chern number and is therefore an integer . to clarify the invalidity of the argument ,",
    "let us calculate the hall conductance directly and concretely .",
    "equation ( [ hall ] ) is transformed into @xmath45 by using the commutation relation .",
    "the first term is equal to @xmath46 when @xmath47 bands are below the fermi energy , by utilizing the number of states of mbz of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , if the second term is negligible , the chern number argument is invalid .",
    "in fact , this occurs .",
    "the result of our numerical calculation is shown in fig.2 .",
    "plateaus appear as non - integers .",
    "in fact , the second term is at most of the order @xmath49 in units of @xmath50 , thus negligible .",
    "what the author wants to say is that although hall conductance has a form of integration of chern class , nevertheless , it does not become an integer .",
    "why the integration did not become an integer is rather simple : it forms no connection .",
    "when we take one of the largest open coverings , i.e. , whole base space minus measure zero subspace , a quantity on the covering can not be always regarded as a connection . in our case , this occurred . in the argument",
    ", the basis for being integers is only that hall conductance is written in the same form as the chern number , which lacks confirmation whether the quantity made by wave functions can form a connection . and in fact , it can not ; hence , the reason this failure occurred . +",
    "believers of the chern number argument say that the chern number within a landau level has yet to be observed since the energy gap is too small .",
    "but can such an anomalous behavior of hall conductance actually be observed ?",
    "experiments in a magnetic field so far show us monotonic behavior when gate voltage or magnetic field varies@xcite .",
    "our calculation here is consistent with those experiments in being monotonic .",
    "development of an experimental method that sheds light on small energy gaps will clarify which is the correct perspective .",
    "let us consider the following quantity : @xmath51 let us write @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is always taken to be @xmath55 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath56 .",
    "then , ( i ) if @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59                          , where @xmath72 is the fermi energy . the vertical axis is the hall conductance in units of @xmath50 .",
    "the condition is the same as fig.1 .",
    "the calculation is done at @xmath73 . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the lowest landau level splits into three bands as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . when the fermi energy is in the gaps , the hall conductance exhibits plateaus of approximately @xmath74.,width=453 ]      k. von klitzing , g. dorda and m. pepper , phys . rev .",
