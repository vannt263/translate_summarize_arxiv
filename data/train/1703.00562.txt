    "for comparison with ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 , we grew crystals of ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 by an in - flux technique @xcite and studied its pressure and field dependence by electrical resistivity and ac calorimetry measurements ( see methods for details ) . figure  [ fig : fig1]a shows the low - temperature electrical resistivity , @xmath33 , on sample s1 at representative pressures , and the inset displays @xmath33 in the whole @xmath12-range .",
    "although nd - substitution reduces @xmath34 from 3.8 k to 3.4 k and slightly increases the residual resistivity @xmath35 to 0.2  @xmath36 , the @xmath37-dependence reported in fig .",
    "1a is essentially identical to that of cerhin@xmath0 below @xmath38  gpa where @xmath5 equals @xmath25 .",
    "we also note that , at zero pressure , the @xmath39 phase diagram of ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 closely resembles the one found in cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath1 nd does not change drastically the local afm character of @xmath25 below @xmath40 .",
    "once @xmath5 exceeds @xmath25 at @xmath40 , there is no evidence for magnetism in @xmath33 , and the possibility of nd - induced magnetism is obscured by the zero - resistance state below @xmath5 . to investigate whether there is afm order in the sc state , heat capacity measurements are necessary .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1]b shows the @xmath12-dependence of heat capacity divided by temperature ( @xmath41 ) for sample s2 at various pressures . at ambient pressure , @xmath41 peaks at @xmath25 as in cerhin@xmath0 . as @xmath12 is lowered further",
    ", however , @xmath42 turns up below @xmath43  k , which was not observed in cerhin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this upturn is presumably associated with the nuclear moment of nd ions , and it can be fit well by a sum of electronic ( @xmath44 ) and nuclear ( @xmath45 ) terms @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "1b shows that @xmath46 is linear in @xmath47 , consistent with the presence of a nuclear schottky contribution .",
    "we note , however , that an upturn also is observed at @xmath48  gpa ( not shown ) where magnetic order is absent , suggesting that the hyperfine field may not be solely responsible for splitting the nuclear levels .",

    "evidence for bulk sc ( marked by asterisks ) , however , is observed at lower temperatures relative to the zero - resistance state in @xmath33 .",
    "a difference between zero - resistance and bulk sc transitions also appears in cerhin@xmath0 and has been attributed to filamentary sc due to the presence of long - range afm order @xcite . unlike cerhin@xmath0 at pressures greater than @xmath26",
    ", however , there is evidence for a phase transition in the sc state of ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 without an applied field . at @xmath50  gpa , an anomaly in @xmath42",
    "is observed at @xmath51  k ( arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) , below the sc transition at @xmath5  =  @xmath52  k. for reasons discussed below , this anomaly stems from a magnetic order , and it is fundamentally different from the afm order displayed by the system for pressures smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "the shape and magnitude of the anomaly relative to that at @xmath5 are very similar to those at @xmath25 in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 ( see supplemental materials ) , and the small entropy associated with it suggests that the magnetic order is most likely a small - moment density wave . as we will come to later , this evidence is most obvious in data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we summarize the zero - field results discussed above in the @xmath12-@xmath37 phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "local - moment - like afm order coexists with bulk sc in a narrow pressure range below @xmath40 . from just below to just above @xmath40 , @xmath29 changes discontinuously , in contrast to field - induced magnetism in cerhin@xmath0 , which is a smooth continuation of @xmath29 from below @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this supports the interpretation that @xmath9- and nd - induced magnetic orders have different origins .",
    "therefore , the nd - induced transition is labeled @xmath53 to distinguish it from @xmath25 in pure cerhin@xmath0 . above @xmath40",
    ", @xmath53 is suppressed at a rate of @xmath54  k / gpa and extrapolates to zero temperature , i.e. a quantum - critical point , at @xmath55 gpa inside the superconducting phase . whether the coincidence of @xmath56 and @xmath57 is accidental or not requires further investigation beyond the scope of our work . as shown in the supplemental materials ,",
    "the rate of suppression of this nd - induced transition is the same rate found in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 within experimental uncertainty , strongly indicating a common origin . because entropy associated with the zero - field transition is rather small , as found in ce@xmath31nd@xmath32coin@xmath0 , the typical signature of quantum criticality ( i.e. , divergence of @xmath58 at low-@xmath12 ) is likely hidden by sc and by the upturn in @xmath58 .",
    "we also note that the highest @xmath5 achieved in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 , @xmath59  k , is @xmath60  k lower than @xmath61 of cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "this same suppression of @xmath61 is observed in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 and indicates that nd ions act similarly as magnetic pair - breaking impurities .",

    "@xmath62  gpa and @xmath55  gpa . ]    to further investigate the nature of the nd - induced magnetism , we turn to the field - dependent heat capacity data .",

    "@xmath49 @xmath12 at @xmath50  gpa ( @xmath63 ) and low magnetic fields .",
    "the zero - field transition at @xmath64  k remains unchanged in a field of @xmath65  koe .",
    "as the field is increased further , however , the specific heat anomaly splits , one anomaly moving to lower temperatures and the other to higher temperatures . at @xmath66  koe ,",
    "our data show features at @xmath51  k and @xmath67  k. previous reports on cerhin@xmath0 at similar pressures ( @xmath68  gpa ) show that the field - induced transition emerges at @xmath69  k when @xmath70  koe @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to associate the anomaly we observe at @xmath51  k and 11  koe with the field - induced magnetism in cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "further , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b shows the high-@xmath9 evolution of @xmath25 with a field dependence very similar to that of cerhin@xmath0 : @xmath25 first increases with @xmath9 and then remains constant above the upper critical field @xmath28 . as shown in the @xmath39 phase diagram ( fig .",
    "3c ) , this field - induced @xmath25 clearly competes with @xmath53 , as reflected in the rapid suppression of @xmath53 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , no evidence for @xmath53 is observed at fields @xmath71  koe , implying a field - induced quantum - critical point in addition to the pressure - induced , zero - field critical point of this order . due to the reasons explained above",
    ", our results strongly point to two distinct types of magnetism emerging in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 .",
    "the first one is due to nd ions and it has the hallmarks of that in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 . the second is the @xmath9-induced magnetism that appears in pure cerhin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "what is the role of nd and why is it special ? at a concentration of @xmath1 , average spacing of @xmath72@xmath73 and non - periodic distribution on ce - sites , nd is too dilute to induce magnetic order by dipole or indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interactions .",
    "its role , then , must be more subtle . using the bulk modulus of cerhin@xmath0 and the unit - cell volume variation in ce@xmath31nd@xmath32rhin@xmath0",
    ", we estimate that ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 experiences an effective chemical pressure of @xmath74  gpa relative to cerhin@xmath0 @xcite . from the phase diagram of cerhin@xmath0",
    ", this @xmath75 would increase @xmath25 by @xmath76  k instead of producing the observed reduction .",
    "hence , we conclude that chemical pressure @xmath77 is not the dominant tuning parameter .",
    "the disruption of translational periodicity of the ce lattice by nd substitution creates a  kondo hole \" that contributes to reducing @xmath25 at zero pressure @xcite .",
    "the latter conclusion is supported by the observation that non - magnetic la substitution for ce in cerhin@xmath0 also depresses @xmath25 similarly @xcite .",
    "neodymium , however , carries an additional magnetic moment that is unlikely to be quenched by kondo screening . in the context of cecoin@xmath0 ,",
    "michal and mineev @xcite proposed that the @xmath13-phase observed in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field is the consequence of the condensation of the spin - exciton collective mode found in the sc phase .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider whether the nd magnetic moments immersed in cerhin@xmath0 at zero field could also promote a similar behavior .    as discussed in detail in the supplemental materials , condensation of spin excitons takes place when the spin - resonance - mode frequency @xmath78 vanishes . within an random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "approach , the latter is given by the pole of the renormalized magnetic susceptibility , i.e. when @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the effective electronic interaction projected in the sdw channel and @xmath81 is the non - interacting magnetic susceptibility inside the sc state .",
    "when the ordering vector @xmath16 connects points of the fermi surface with different signs of the sc gap , * @xmath82 * , @xmath83 generically diverges when @xmath84 and remains non - zero when @xmath85 .",
    "thus , even a very weak @xmath80 can in principle induce a resonance mode with frequency near @xmath86 . once the interaction increases , @xmath78 moves to lower frequencies",
    ". when the interaction overcomes a critical value , @xmath87 , the resonance mode vanishes and sdw order is established inside the sc dome .     as function of the total impurity scattering rate for the cases of non - magnetic ( red curve ) and paramagnetic impurities ( blue curve ) .",
    "b ) the suppression of the effective sc gap @xmath4 by both magnetic and non - magnetic impurities . in these plots",
    ", we considered point - like impurities .",
    "here , @xmath88 is the gap of the clean system whereas @xmath89 is the landau damping ( see supplemental materials for details ) . ]    in our case , the interaction @xmath80 is presumably independent of pressure .",
    "thus , in order for magnetic impurities to promote spin - exciton condensation , @xmath90 must increase ( i.e. the critical interaction value @xmath91 must decrease ) as function of the impurity potential . to investigate whether this is a sensible scenario , we considered a toy model consisting of two `` hot spots '' located at momenta @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the fermi surface such that * @xmath82*. note that such a hot - spots model has been previously employed to study the effects of disorder on sc @xcite . to focus on the general properties of the model , we linearize the band dispersion around the hot spots and compute both @xmath90 and the effective gap amplitude @xmath4 at @xmath94 as function of the total impurity scattering rate @xmath95 within the self - consistent born approximation ( similarly to what was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath96 sc and perfectly nested bands ) .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , whereas both magnetic and non - magnetic impurity scattering suppress @xmath4 at the same rate ( panel 4b ) , we find that @xmath90 is suppressed for non - magnetic impurity but enhanced by magnetic impurity scattering ( panel 4a ) .",
    "thus , in the case of non - magnetic impurities , athough the resonance mode frequency may decrease as compared to the clean case , it never collapses to zero .",
    "because magnetic impurity scattering enhances @xmath90 but not necessarily destroys sc , the system may undergo an sdw transition inside the sc dome .",
    "although the fate of the system will depend on microscopic details beyond those captured by the toy model considered here , our model nicely illustrates that it is plausible for magnetic impurity scattering to drive spin - exciton condensation in the sc phase . in this regard",
    ", we note that previous investigations of a microscopically - motivated theoretical model also found that the @xmath13-phase may be stabilized by magnetic impurities even at zero external field @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that other magnetic impurities could induce the same type of sdw order in both cecoin@xmath0 and pressurized cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we show in the supplemental materials that easy - plane gd@xmath97 ions ( @xmath98 ) also induce a transition in the heat capacity data of both co and rh members .",
    "this anomaly is similar to the one induced by easy - axis ( @xmath8-axis ) nd@xmath97 ions ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) discussed above .",
    "hence , nd is not `` special '' in inducing magnetic order in the superconducting states of ce@xmath2nd@xmath3coin@xmath0 and ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 , and other unconventional superconductors that host a spin resonance mode may also display zero - field magnetism via the same mechanism .",
    "our results also imply that non - magnetic impurities will not induce condensation of excitations , in agreement with experimental data on la - substituted cerhin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the sdw ordering vector in nd - doped cecoin@xmath0 corresponds closely to the nodal structure @xcite that is also found in the superconducting state of cerhin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , the magnetic wave - vector of zero - field order above @xmath40 in ce@xmath2nd@xmath3rhin@xmath0 should also be close to * * q**@xmath102 , and we expect neutron scattering experiments to find a spin resonance of @xmath8-axis character below @xmath5 in cerhin@xmath0 at @xmath30 .",
    "in summary , we generalize the observation of nd - induced magnetism in cecoin@xmath0 to pressurized cerhin@xmath0 and gd - substituted members . this spin - density wave order , which reflects the nodal - gap symmetry , is argued to be a consequence of the condensation of spin excitations that arise inside the sc state . given the several similarities between cecoin@xmath0 and ce@xmath103pdin@xmath104 @xcite , nd substitution might nucleate afm order in its superconducting state .",
    "appropriate substitutions in other unconventional superconductors that host a spin resonance also should induce zero - field magnetism by the same mechanism , and magnetism should be tunable to a quantum - critical point inside their sc phase .",

    "<S> unconventional superconductivity is a natural candidate state because it can be induced by an attractive cooper - pair interaction provided by the fluctuating magnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples include copper - oxides , which without chemical substitution are afm mott insulators @xcite , metallic iron - based antiferromagnets that superconduct under pressure or with chemical substitutions @xcite , and rare - earth heavy - fermion compounds with large effective electronic masses @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic manifestation of the unconventional nature of the superconducting state is the momentum dependence of the sc gap @xmath4 that develops below the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to conventional superconductors , @xmath4 is not uniform but instead has different signs in different regions of the fermi surface . despite the distinct chemical and electronic properties of these materials , </S>",

    "<S> an additional common feature among these different classes of superconductors is the emergence of a collective magnetic excitation below @xmath5 often attributed to the formation of a spin exciton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this collective mode , whose energy has been shown to scale with @xmath4 across different materials @xcite , is a direct consequence of the sign - changing nature of @xmath4 . </S>",
