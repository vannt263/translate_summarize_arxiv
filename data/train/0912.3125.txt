    "early numerical relativity simulations using a 3 + 1 split of the einstein equations suffered from so - called slice stretching , an effect which occurs when using singularity avoiding slicing together with a vanishing shift .",
    "the slices become highly distorted when time marches on in the outer regions of the grid but slows down in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "it became clear that a non - vanishing , outwards pointing shift vector would be required in order to redistribute grid points and also to prevent grid points from falling into the black hole .",

    "@xcite combined the 1+log slicing condition with a dynamical shift condition called gamma - driver .",
    "these gauge conditions successfully prevented slice stretching in black hole simulations using excision .",
    "it turned out that such gauge conditions could be used also for fixed punctures with slight modifications to keep the puncture from evolving  @xcite .",
    "the fixed - puncture modification was removed in  @xcite when the moving puncture method was introduced .",
    "1+log slicing with gamma - driver shift succeeds in moving the puncture freely through the grid while simultaneously avoiding slice - stretching .",
    "the basic reason for the success of this gauge condition is that when the slices start to stretch , the shift vector counteracts by pulling out grid points from the region near the black hole .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the dissipation or damping parameter in the gamma - driver shift condition , which plays an important role in the success of this gauge . in order to reduce oscillations in the shift vector ,",
    "the authors of @xcite noticed the necessity of a damping term in the shift condition .",
    "adjusting the strength of the damping via a damping parameter was found to allow freezing of the evolution at late times in @xcite and to avoid drifts in metric variables in  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the value of the damping coefficient was found to affect the coordinate location of the apparent horizon and therefore the resolution of the black hole on the numerical grid  @xcite .",
    "the right choice of the damping value is therefore important if one wants to resolve the black hole properly while still driving the coordinates to a frame where they are stationary when the physical situation is stationary and hence obtain a stable evolution .",
    "the specific value of the damping parameter has to be adapted to the black hole mass in order to obtain long term stable evolutions . if the damping parameter is either too small or too large , there are unwanted oscillations or a coordinate instability , respectively . in binary simulations ,",
    "a typical choice is a constant value of roughly @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total mass of the system .",
    "however , using a constant damping parameter for black hole binaries with unequal masses leads to a fundamental problem . with a constant damping parameter ,",
    "the effective damping near each black hole is asymmetric for unequal black hole masses since the damping parameter has dimensions @xmath2 . for large mass ratios",
    ", this asymmetry in the grid can be so large that simulations fail because the damping may become too large for one of the black holes .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the highest mass ratio that has been successfully simulated up to now is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "advantageous would be a position - dependent damping parameter that adapts to the local mass , in particular such that in the vicinity of the @xmath4 puncture with mass @xmath5 its value approaches @xmath6 .",
    "it was noticed before @xcite that a damping coefficient adapted to the various parameters of the simulation would be beneficial . in @xcite",
    "a position - dependent formula was introduced for head - on collisions of black holes , which to our knowledge was only used in one other publication @xcite , prior to the moving puncture framework . in this paper , we take first steps towards a position - dependent damping parameter for moving punctures . as a consequence , the local coordinates change compared to standard simulations , but this does not significantly affect gauge invariant quantities like the extracted waves as we discuss below .",
    "we focus on the gauge condition used in the 3 + 1 splitting of the einstein equations , in particular on the condition for the shift vector .",
    "the slices are determined by the 1+log slicing condition @xcite for the lapse function @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the coordinates of a given slice are governed by the gamma - driver shift condition introduced in @xcite as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the contracted christoffel symbols of the conformal metric @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the shift vector and @xmath14 is the damping coefficient we will discuss in this publication . in eqs .",

    ". some minimal amount of damping is important to suppress noise in the gauge when a puncture is moving . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath23 is too large then there are gauge instabilities , leading to a loss of convergence and to instability of the entire numerical evolution .",
    "furthermore , early simulations for fixed punctures also found that @xmath23 should take values around @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the total mass , to avoid long - term coordinate drifts at the outer boundary @xcite .    in simulations of black hole binaries with total mass @xmath24",
    ", we usually set @xmath25 which has been found to work well in equal mass binaries simulations .",

    "in fact , for the mass ratio 1:10 in @xcite , the choice @xmath29 failed , but a smaller value for @xmath23 was chosen such that @xmath30 for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    to overcome the conflicts between punctures with different masses in evolutions of two or more black holes",
    ", we suggest to construct a non - constant , position - dependent damping parameter which knows about the position and mass of each puncture and takes a suitable value at every grid point .",
