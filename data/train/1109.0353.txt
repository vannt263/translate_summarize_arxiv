    "in addition to correcting the mistakes in @xcite , introduced a new idea that allowed him to improve the bounds on the degree of homotopy groups in his homotopy approximation theorem . with the help of analogous methods and some additional techniques of ours , in the recent work @xcite",

    "the first purpose of this article is to obtain a improved version of the equivariant homotopy approximation theorem of @xcite . since the arguments are analogous to those in @xcite , we only state our new results and refer to the references for detailed proofs ( cf .",

    "the second purpose is to consider the possibility of approximating the space of continuous maps by its subspaces of algebraic maps of a fixed degree , analogously to the results of segal @xcite and mostovoy @xcite . because the situation is analogous , in this paper",

    "a proof of this fact already appears in ( * ? ? ?",

    "there is a natural map @xmath140 which factors through @xmath18 , @xmath141                in the fibre over this configuration , all points in the upper half plane are sent linearly to the fixed point @xmath145 and those in the lower half plane to @xmath146 . for a @xmath128 or @xmath147 fold particle lying on the real line ,",
    "@xmath134 of the particles are moved to @xmath148 and @xmath134 are moved to to @xmath146 leaving @xmath55 or @xmath129 particles in place .",
    "this argument shows that the fibres of both @xmath149 and @xmath142 are contractible .",
    "next , we will show that the maps @xmath144 and @xmath142 are both quasi - fibrations .",
    "consider a point ( configuration of particles ) in @xmath136 . by a singular sub - configuration for colour @xmath138   we mean a collection @xmath1 particles of distinct colours other than the @xmath138-th colour which are all located at the same point .",
    "intuitively , we think of a singular configuration for the @xmath138-th colour as an obstacle through which a particle of the @xmath138-th colour can not pass . by a singular sub - configuration ( without specifying the colour ) we mean a singular sub - configuration for any colour .    clearly , it is easy to see that the topology of the fibre over a particular configuration in @xmath136 is determined by two quantities : the number of particles of each colour in @xmath136 and the number of singular sub - configurations ( for each colour ) .",
    "hence , it the proof we will consider filtrations with respect to the number of particles of each colour and the number of singular sub - configurations .    for non - negative integers @xmath150 with @xmath151 , let @xmath152 denote the subspace of @xmath136 consisting of configurations with precisely @xmath153 particles of the @xmath138-th colour .",

    ". set theoretic differences between these spaces are the spaces @xmath155 over which the maps are locally trivial fibre bundles and hence quasifibrations .",
    "now we apply the dold - thom criterion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.3 ) . to do so we have to construct an open neighbourhood of @xmath158 in @xmath159 , a deformation of this neighbourhood onto @xmath158 , together with a corresponding covering neighbourhood and a covering deformation required by the dold - thom criterion ( since all the fibres are contractible the condition that the induced maps on the fibres are homotopy equivalences is automatically satisfied ) .",
    "such neighbourhoods and deformations are easy to describe intuitively .",
    "the set of points of the required neighbourhood of @xmath158 consists of the points of @xmath158 together with those configurations in @xmath159 with at least one non - singular sub - configuration of @xmath1 particles of different colours contained in a sufficiently small   interval . here",
    "sufficiently small   refers to the requirement that the particles in this sub - configuration be much nearer to each other than they are to any other particle and that the length of the minimal interval containing the sub - configuration be much less than the length of any interval containing a collection of @xmath131 particles of different colour .",
    "the deformation can now be defined by introducing a force of attraction between particles of different colour ( e.g. a force field satisfying an inverse - square law ) . by induction on @xmath134",
    "we show that the maps @xmath144 and @xmath142 are quasifibrations over @xmath160 .",
    "we now fix @xmath161 and filter the space @xmath136 according to the number of points of the @xmath131-th colour .",
    "the set theoretic differences between the terms of the filtration are precisely the spaces @xmath152 and we have already proved that the restriction of the maps @xmath149 and @xmath142 to the inverse images of these spaces are quasi - fibrations . we apply again the dold - thom criterion . for this purpose",
    "we need to construct open neighbourhoods of spaces of configurations with no more than @xmath162 particles of the last colour in the space of configurations of no more than @xmath134-particles of the last colour .",
    "the method is again analogous to the one we used earlier .",
    "our deformation will pull together pairs of particles of the last colour which are very close by means of a gravitational force field between particles of the last colour .",
    "for this purpose we must avoid hitting a singular sub - configuration .",
    "again , it is easy to see that we can choose open neighbourhoods and deformations with the right properties .",
    "this proves that the maps restricted to the pre - images of spaces with the number of particles of the first @xmath163 colours fixed are quasifibrations .",

    "<S> we study the homotopy types of certain spaces closely related to the spaces of algebraic ( rational ) maps from the @xmath0 dimensional real projective space into the @xmath1 dimensional complex projective space for @xmath2 ( we conjecture this relation to be a homotopy equivalence ) . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we proved that natural maps of these spaces to the spaces of all continuous maps are @xmath3-equivariant homotopy equivalences , where the @xmath3-equivariant action is induced from the conjugation on @xmath4 . in the same article we also proved that the homotopy types of the terms of the natural degree filtration approximate closer and closer the homotopy type of the space of continuous maps and obtained bounds that describe the closeness of the approximation in terms of the degrees of the maps . in this paper , we improve the estimates of the bounds by using new methods invented in @xcite and used in @xcite .    in addition , </S>",
    "<S> in the the last section , we prove a special case ( @xmath5 ) of the conjecture stated in @xcite that our spaces are homotopy equivalent to the spaces of algebraic maps . </S>"
