    "introduction of supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive directions to construct models beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since susy cures the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , when susy breaking mass terms of squarks and sleptons are generic in the susy sm , too large flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are predicted . this problem is called as the susy flavor problem . in addition",
    ", the susy sm also has the susy cp problem . the susy breaking trilinear and bilinear scalar coupling terms ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms ) and the gaugino mass terms have cp phases generically .",
    "the predictions for electric dipole moments are rather large , though the constraints by experiments are severe .",
    "the gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite are an excellent solution to these problems .",
    "susy breaking in a hidden sector is transmitted to the visible sector through the sm gauge interactions , which are flavor - blind .",
    "the susy breaking mass terms of squarks and sleptons are then flavor - blind , so that dangerous fcnc processes are naturally suppressed .",
    "in addition , the phases of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms are automatically aligned to those of the gaugino mass terms in the minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) model @xcite , since the @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms are vanishing at tree level in the model . in the case , the susy cp problem is avoided favor a low messenger scale ( @xmath5  tev ) in the mgm model .",
    "this is quite consistent with the ultra light gravitino discussed in this paper . ] .    in the gmsb models",
    ", the lightest susy particle is the gravitino , with mass @xmath6(1  ev - 10  gev ) .",
    "an ultra light gravitino @xmath7  ev is known to have no cosmological gravitino problem , such as overclosure @xcite and too large free - streaming lengths @xcite .",
    "however , only a few models were previously proposed in order to realize the ultra light gravitino @xcite .",
    "recently murayama and nomura proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple scheme to construct the gmsb models along a metastable susy breaking scenario .",
    "metastable susy breaking is recognized as an interesting alternative susy breaking scenario , after intriligator , seiberg and shih found that even simple vector - like theories , such as susy su(n ) qcd , can break susy on metastable local minima @xcite .",
    "many phenomenological models with metastable susy breaking vacua are nowadays discussed .",
    "the scheme proposed by murayama and nomura has a quite simple structure and a possibility of the ultra light gravitino mass @xmath0 .",
    "however , the stability of the metastable vacua becomes weaker for smaller gravitino mass .",
    "it is not clear whether the lifetimes of the metastable vacua are longer than the age of the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we study stability of the susy breaking metastable vacuum in the gmsb model which is realized in their scheme as an effective theory @xcite , in the case of the ultra light gravitino mass .",
    "the lifetime of the metastable vacuum is numerically evaluated in the semiclassical techniques @xcite . in the evaluation",
    "we include the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) potential in the scalar potential , which destabilizes the metastable vacuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors estimated the lifetime by a triangular approximation @xcite .",
    "however , this approximation is not accurate especially in this model , since several scalar fields are relevant to the phase transition , as the authors mentioned in their text . in the case , numerical calculation is required to estimate a reliable value of the transition rate .",
    "we also derive upperbounds on the squark mass and the cutoff scale for ultraviolet ( uv ) models for @xmath0 .",
    "the bound on the gravitino mass can be translated to those on the squark and gluino masses in this model , since the visible sector is more directly coupled with the hidden sector in this model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we review the model discussed in ref .  @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the stability of the metastable vacuum and constraints on parameters of this model .",
    "section 4 is devoted to summary .",
    "in this section we review the gmsb model with the metastable vacuum discussed in ref .",
    "this model is realized in their scheme to construct the gmsb model , and has a quite simple structure .",
    "the relation between the gravitino mass and the stability of the metastable susy breaking vacuum is also clarified here .",
    "the superpotential and k@xmath8hler potential in this model are given by @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a gauge singlet chiral field and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are messenger fields , which transform as @xmath14 and @xmath15 under the su(5)@xmath16 gauge symmetry , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be taken to be real and positive without loss of generality , which are taken as free parameters in this model .",
    "this model is an effective theory below the uv cutoff scale @xmath20 .",
    "it is assumed that higher terms of @xmath21 appear after some particles with cutoff - scale mass are integrated out .",
    "the negative sign of the @xmath22 term is required for deriving a local minimum near the origin .",
    "the expansion in the above k@xmath8hler potential implies that @xmath11 has some approximate conserved charge .",
    "for example , we can assign @xmath23 charges of 2 , 0 and 0 to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , although the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpotential ] ) violates this symmetry explicitly .",
    "the tree - level scalar potential is given from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : kahler ] ) by @xmath31 , we impose the following condition , @xmath32 in the case that this condition is not satisfied , the global minimum ( [ eq : globalmin ] ) is not determined within validity of this potential and dependent on uv models , so that we could not discuss the stability of the vacuum .",
    "next , this potential also has a local minimum at the origin of the field space , @xmath33 .",
    "susy is broken in this vacuum due to non - zero @xmath34 term , @xmath35 .",
    "the mass squared for the scalar component of the singlet field @xmath11 is given by @xmath36 .",
    "the stability of this metastable vacuum becomes weaker for larger @xmath20 , since the potential for @xmath11 direction becomes flat .",
    "the masses for the fermionic and scalar components of the messenger fields are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , around the origin .",
    "this minimum is metastable when the following condition is satisfied , @xmath39 when @xmath40 is close to @xmath41 , the potential for the direction along @xmath42 is flat and this metastable vacuum becomes unstable .",
    "the spontaneous susy breaking is link to the @xmath23 symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , this symmetry is approximate in this model since the susy mass terms of messenger fields violate it .",
    "the radiative correction from messenger fields destabilizes the susy breaking metastable vacuum .",
    "thus , it is essential to include the radiative correction in discussing the stability of the metastable vacuum .",
    "the messenger fields induce the following cw effective potential , @xmath43 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath45 is the number of messenger fields that propagate in the loop diagrams , and @xmath46 in our case . in the second line ,",
    "the cw potential is expanded by @xmath11 around the origin only with the leading - order contribution about @xmath47 , and constant terms are neglected .",
    "the field value of @xmath11 on the local minimum is shifted toward the positive direction , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 become smaller .",
    "thus , the cw potential makes the local minimum more unstable .",
    "nevertheless , as long as @xmath20 is small enough to satisfy @xmath50 the local minimum remains and exists near the origin : @xmath51 . at this false vacuum ,",
    "the condition ( [ eq : constraint_f ] ) does not significantly change , of course , as far as @xmath52 is small enough .",
    "now we discuss the relation between the gravitino mass and the stability of the metastable susy breaking vacuum .",
    "first we give the gravitino mass , normalized by the squark mass , in this model .",
    "the susy breaking is mediated to the visible sector by messenger fields .",
    "the gaugino and sfermion masses are induced at the messenger scale @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the quadratic casimir , @xmath56 is the number of the messenger pair , and @xmath57 for our minimal case .",
    "we assumed @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the last form .",
    "then , the gravitino mass is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61  gev is the reduced planck mass . here the mass scale is normalized by the squark mass @xmath1 calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : squark_mass ] ) .",
    "small @xmath62 is required in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravitino ] ) for the ultra light gravitino .",
    "however , the small value of @xmath63 may lead to the tachyonic messengers , and the large value of @xmath18 also destabilizes the local minimum once radiative corrections are included .",
    "the constraints ( [ eq : constraint_f ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint_s ] ) lead to the lowerbound on the value of @xmath64 as @xmath65 thus , the ultra light gravitino @xmath7  ev is marginal .    in this estimate",
    "we omitted all possible @xmath66 coefficients .",
    "the precise value of the minimum of @xmath62 is essential to discuss the possibility of the ultra light gravitino in this model . in next section",
    "we evaluate the decay rate of the false vacuum numerically and constrain the parameter space of this model .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the stability of the susy breaking false vacuum is weaker for smaller gravitino mass .",
    "hence , we should carefully estimate the transition rate of the false vacuum to the true ones .",
    "it can be evaluated in the semiclassical techniques @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the transition rate of false vacua described by scalar fields @xmath67 is calculated by the euclidean path integral @xmath68~e^{-s_e[\\phi_i]}$ ] , which is dominated by the so - called `` bounce '' configuration @xmath69 .",

    "once we find the bounce solution , the transition rate per unit volume is estimated as @xmath73 the prefactor @xmath3 has the fourth power of the typical scale in the potential and @xmath74-s_e[\\phi^f_i],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are constant configurations that continue to stay at the false vacuum .",
    "several complex scalar fields exist in the present model .",
    "hence , we should estimate @xmath76 by finding the bounce solution in a numerical method . in the following ,",
    "we explain our calculation . for simplicity , we take all fields real and @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath26 term potential for messenger fields makes this configuration @xmath77 , and the potential for the direction along @xmath42 becomes unstable when @xmath11 is increased .",
    "then , defining @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we have the following @xmath72 symmetric euclidean action , @xmath80   =     2\\pi^2 \\int_0^\\infty dr~r^3     \\left [ \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\frac{k_i}{2 } \\left(\\frac{d \\phi_i}{d r}\\right)^2    + v(\\phi_i ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the scalar potential , including the cw potential , that is the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : potential_tree ] ) and ( [ eq : potential_cw ] ) .",
    "then the bounce solution @xmath84 is given by solving the following equations of motion , @xmath85 with boundary conditions , @xmath86 since the prefactor @xmath3 is approximately given as @xmath87 , @xmath88 is required to make the lifetime of the false vacuum much longer than the age of the universe .    to solve the above equations and find the bounce configuration numerically , we used the calculation method discussed in ref .",
    "we discretized eqs .",

    "then we gradually increase @xmath96 to 4 and decrease @xmath97 to 0 with solving the above equations , and finally the desired bounce solution is obtained is obtained for a parameter set , new bounce solutions for the new parameter sets are also iteratively derived from it . in this derivation",

    "the description as an effective low - energy theory becomes inadequate and higher order terms neglected in eq .",

    "uv models are needed for complete analysis .",
    "the lowerbound on @xmath64 can be translated to the constraints on the gravitino and squark mass through eq .",

[ fig : constraint ]  ( right ) , we show the allowed region for the squark and gravitino masses for several values of @xmath101 , where the allowed regions are below lines . from this figure , the upperbound on the squark mass for fixed value of @xmath105 is obtained .",
    "it is found that the relatively light squark mass @xmath106  gev are required to have @xmath107 even if @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath20 is larger , the constraint is more severe .",
    "the ultra light gravitino in this model may be checked , since the mass range is accessible in the lhc experiments .",

    "( [ eq : gravitino ] ) .",
    "the upperbound on the squark mass is slightly relaxed without this approximation .",

    "the lep experiments constrain the sm - like higgs boson mass as @xmath109  gev @xcite .",
    "for the large enough higgs boson mass , the stop mass should be larger than about 1000  gev to have a large radiative correction through top and stop loop diagrams .",
    "this suggests that the cutoff scale is low enough to satisfy @xmath110 as in fig .",

    "this is reduced to the bound , @xmath111 , with @xmath112 .",
