    "jets are produced by the hard scattering of two partons .",
    "two scattered partons propagate nearly back - to - back in azimuth from the collision point and fragment into jet - like spray of final state particles ( the schematic view is in figure 1 ) .",
    "these particles have a transverse momentum @xmath2 with respect to the parent partons , with component @xmath3 projected onto the azimuthal plane .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath3 measured at lower energies has been found to be @xmath0 and @xmath4 independent .    in collinear",
    "partonic collisions , the two partons emerge with the same magnitude of transverse momentum in opposite directions . however , the partons carry the `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum @xmath1 before the collision .",
    "this momentum affects the outgoing transverse momentum @xmath4 , resulting in a momentum imbalance ( i.e. transverse momentum of one jet does not lie in the plane determined by the transverse momentum of the second jet and the beam axes ) and consequently affects the back - to - back correlations of final high @xmath4 hadrons @xcite .",
    "the back - to - back azimuthal correlations of high @xmath4 hadrons is written as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity between a trigger and their associated particles .",
    "the azimuthal correlation function displays a two - peak structure , where the width of the near - side peak is denoted by @xmath8 and the width of the away - side peak is @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath8 carries information on the fragmentation process only i.e. @xmath2 . for particles with average transverse momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 from the same jet , the width of the near - side correlation , @xmath8 , can be related to @xmath12 as @xcite :    @xmath13    the width of the away - side peak @xmath9 contain the contribution of the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath1 .",
    "it has been characterized by a gaussian distribution @xcite    @xmath14    the azimuthal correlations are used extensively in heavy ions collisions to understand the parton suppression mechanisms .",
    "we have concentrated in this work to the simplest case i.e. p - p to understand the size and details of the peaks in azimuthal correlations .",
    "correlation function was calculated choosing @xmath15=0 , 1 , 4 @xmath16 at 200 gev in a mid - rapidity region ( @xmath17 0.7 ) .",
    "charged hadrons in 4 < @xmath18 < 6 gev / c and in 2 gev @xmath19 p@xmath20 4 gev are defined to be trigger and associated particles respectively . in the actual calculation , we use pythia 6.325 @xcite in aliroot @xcite to simulate each hard scattering where a gaussian distribution is assuming for @xmath1 .",
    "the correlations functions were fitted by the sum of two gaussians , one for the near - side component ( around @xmath6 = 0 radians ) and one for the away - side component ( around @xmath6 = @xmath21 radians ) and a constant for the uncorrelated pairs .",
    "figure 2 compares experimental data @xcite with different @xmath15 simulations . in the four cases",
    "is observed that can not reproduce experimental data . in order to reproduce the experimental data",
    ", we characterize the intrinsic momentum by two gaussians distributions     = 200 gev , experimental data @xcite and simulations with different @xmath15 ]    @xmath22    this distribution was adding in pythia code and calculated the azimuthal correlations .",
    "the figure 3 show the experimental data and the simulation .",
    "the simulation is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are 0.558 @xmath25 0.042 and @xmath24 = 0.099 @xmath25 0.050 respectively . in addition",
    "the magnitude of the partonic transverse momentum @xmath12 was calculated .",
    "the values obtained of @xmath12 = 0.397 @xmath25 0.091",
    "gev / c are in agreement with the average value @xmath12 = 0.324 @xmath25 0.06 gev / c obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "we report the analysis of experimental azimuthal correlations measured by star in p - p collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "comparisons between experimental data and simulation with different @xmath15 show that the @xmath15 characterized by a gaussian distribution can not reproduce experimental data .    assuming two gaussians distributions for @xmath1 the simulation is in agreement with the experimental data , as far as , we understand the use of two gaussians . it has never been used before to explain the peaks observed in azimuthal correlations .",
