    "we have calculated the luminosity modulation for modes in a disk with radial sound speed profile equal to that of a radiation - pressure dominated shakura - sunyaev disk with @xmath70 .",
    "the exact _ radial _ profile does not greatly effect the estimates , as we can replace the quantity @xmath71 with @xmath72 , the disk energy flux , which is known from energy conservation .",
    "as the mode width @xmath73 , the magnitude of @xmath74 _ does _ affect the luminosity estimates . if we define the _ maximum _ magnitude ( achieved at a radius , @xmath75 ) of the vertical displacement vector @xmath76 to be @xmath77 , then for the case of the mode with one radial node in @xmath78 and two vertical nodes in @xmath79 ( @xmath80 even about the midplane ) we have ( l ) & & 0.6%   h   ( t + )  -   9.8%   h^2   ^2 ( t + ) + & & +   0.2%   h^3   ^3 ( t + )  .",

    "however , we have not properly accounted for radiative transfer effects .",
    "dispersion in photon diffusion times over the extent of the mode will decrease the modulated luminosity for large optical depths .",
    "although the above luminosity modulation is not large , @xmath81 produces , at the fundamental frequency , rms variability @xmath82 [ @xmath83 ] , as is seen for the feature in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the first harmonic can produce this observed rms variability for @xmath84 .",
    "( the rms variability is the coefficient of the @xmath85 term divided by @xmath86 . )",
    "the modulation seen in grs 1915 + 105 increases to 6% if the energy band is restricted to the @xmath41 kev range .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with what we expect for our modes .",
    "if we compare the bolometric luminosity variation of the mode to the bolometric luminosity from the region @xmath87 , the relative fractional variation increases to @xmath40 .    for the _",
    "particular _ radial and vertical disk structure assumed here , the rms variability in the first harmonic is more significant than the rms variability in the fundamental frequency .",
    "as so little is known , both observationally and theoretically , about disk vertical profiles we can not definitively state whether this feature is generic . based upon energy arguments , however , we _ can",
    "_ say that generically disk modes can only produce rms variability @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "we regard the question of which frequency , the fundamental or first harmonic , to associate with the observed 67 hz feature as an open issue .    equation ( [ frequency ] ) indicates that a 67 hz ( fundamental ) modulation can be produced in a disk around a black hole with a mass of 10.6 @xmath90 for a nonrotating hole , and 36.3 @xmath90 for a maximally rotating hole .",
    "there are few  natural \" frequencies to invoke in a black hole system . if one were to appeal to a process occuring at the marginally stable orbit ( @xmath91 for a nonrotating black hole ) , not only would the luminosity from this region be lower than our mode estimates ( due to the no - torque boundary condition used in disk models ) , but also the required hole mass would increase by a factor of at least @xmath92 ( if the 67 hz feature represents the fundamental mode frequency ) .",

    "it is possible to use a parametrized stress tensor to estimate the effects of turbulent viscosity on the modes ( nw92 , nw93 ) .",
    "the canonical energy of a radial mode is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the volume occupied by the mode .",
    "isotropic turbulence produces a rate of change @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , respectively , being the radial and vertical mode wavelengths .",

    "thus , for @xmath101 , we can have high mode @xmath102 .",
    "the other contribution to the fractional width @xmath103 of the corresponding feature in a power spectrum comes from the number of modes that are significantly excited . if we assume that this will include those whose wavelengths are greater than the maximum eddy size @xmath104 divided by the corresponding mach number @xmath105 , equation ( [ frequency ] ) gives f / f   n  ( h / r )  ~   .",
    "[ df ] the minimum effective frequency width will be composed of this span of modes , each broadened by @xmath106 .",
    "the above estimates are for _ isotropic _ viscosity .",
    "if the turbulence does not efficiently couple to the vertical gradients of the modes , then the mode @xmath102 value is increased by a factor @xmath107 ( nw93 ) . aside from damping modes , turbulence can also potentially excite modes .",
    "velocity perturbations in the disk , @xmath108 , are made up of a mode component , @xmath109 , and a turbulent component , @xmath110 .",
    "viscous damping arises from terms of the form @xmath111 , while mode excitation arises from terms of the form @xmath112 ( nw93 ) .",
    "it is possible to make simple estimates of the magnitude of the turbulent excitation , and balance this against the turbulent damping ( nw93 ) .",
    "the modes are excited to an amplitude of @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , for isotropic and anisotropic viscosity , respectively ( nw93 ) .",
    "if turbulence is playing the dominant role in damping and exciting the modes , then we have the following constraints . for isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the @xmath102 value is only large for @xmath101 ; however , this implies a correspondingly small amplitude . for anisotropic viscosity , not only",
    "can we tolerate a larger @xmath60 , but we also achieve a larger mode amplitude , although achieving the observationally required nonlinear mode amplitude is difficult in either case .      as a first approximation , we took the modes to be adiabatic . in reality , we expect there to be small entropy changes due to various effects , the most notable one being radiative losses .",
    "if we have a radiation pressure dominated atmosphere , as is likely in high - luminosity disks , one properly should use p  =   +   s  , [ nonadiabatic ] where @xmath115 is the specific entropy .",
    "we can estimate dependent quantities . ]",
    "the effect of this term for a radiation pressure dominated atmosphere , where one has 4 p ds   - c   c ^2 [ deltas ] ( @xmath116 is the speed of light , @xmath117 is the electron scattering opacity , and we have invoked vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . )    for perturbations of scalars , the lagrangian perturbation operator @xmath53 commutes with total time derivatives @xmath118 ( cf .",

    ", we then have a dispersion relation that can be written in terms of a function @xmath130 , to which we are adding a function @xmath131 due to radiation damping .",

    "as discussed in  2 , the modes must approach nonlinearity in order to be observationally relevant .",
    "if isotropic turbulent excitation determines the mode amplitude , then there is a natural maximum vertical perturbation amplitude with @xmath140 . if the turbulence is anisotropic , on the other hand , then it is possible to achieve @xmath89 , so long as @xmath141 . for this case",

    "currently unknown , damping effects and nonlinearities must limit this radiative mode growth . as a zeroth - order approximation",
    "we take the linear growth rates calculated above to be relevant to the near nonlinear regime , and thus be equal to the saturated damping rate .",

    "observational limits for @xmath3 were rms @xmath143 , and detectable rms @xmath144 for narrow modes .",
    "considering the dominant contributions as @xmath27 and @xmath28 increase , turbulence leads to @xmath145 ( isotropic ) and @xmath146 ( anisotropic ) , whereas radiative damping leads to @xmath147 the limiting detectable rms variabilty is therefore linear in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "turbulent excitation only leads to high @xmath102 values for modes with low @xmath28 ( isotropic ) or low @xmath27 ( anisotropic ) .",
    "radiative damping , on the other hand , only leads to high @xmath102 values for modes modes with low @xmath27 and high @xmath28 .",
    "we note , however , that the mode calculations require a smooth , well - behaved background to perturb .",
    "if small scale turbulence truly is responsible for disk viscosity , our unperturbed hydrodynamic equations are only relevant for the largest scales , again favoring both low @xmath27 and low @xmath28 .",
    "for all cases considered above , a high @xmath102 value is most easily achieved for @xmath101 .",
    "the 67 hz mode seen in grs 1915 + 105 , if a diskoseismic mode , therefore is likely one with low @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the main motivations for attributing the 67 hz feature in grs 1915 + 105 to a diskoseismic mode are that these modes : 1 ) are related to a ",
    "natural \" frequency in the disk ( i.e. the maximum epicyclic frequency ) ; 2 ) their spectra are expected to be characteristic of the inner , hottest regions of the disk ; 3 ) their frequencies are relatively insensitive to changes in luminosity ; and 4 ) they have low rms variability . this latter feature ,",
    "although in agreement with the observations , is the strongest constraint .",
    "these modes _ can not _ be applied to systems that show @xmath148 rms variability over a wide range of energy bands .",
    "we have identified two mechanisms , turbulent excitation and negative radiation damping , that naturally lead to appreciable mode amplitudes with high @xmath102 value for @xmath101 .",
    "again , we stress that the only other  natural \" disk frequency , the keplerian rotation frequency at the last marginally stable circular orbit , would require a black hole mass a factor @xmath149 larger . furthermore",
    ", less flux is emitted from that region than from the @xmath4mode region .",
    "we saw that there were two requirements for the @xmath4modes to be observationally detectable .",
    "first , the @xmath4modes had to be wide , or equivalently the disk had to be luminous , assuming that @xmath150 .",
    "second , the @xmath4mode amplitudes had to approach the nonlinear regime . ideally , one should perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear development of the @xmath4modes to determine mode widths , @xmath102 , and luminosity modulation more accurately .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mhd simulations of stone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) do show copious @xmath12mode production associated with the turbulence ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "( mhd simulations have yet to be performed for rotation and epicyclic frequency profiles relevant to the @xmath4mode trapping region . )",
    "these @xmath4mode oscillations should also exist in accretion disks around compact ( soft equation of state ) , weakly magnetized ( @xmath151 gauss ) neutron stars . under these conditions ,",
    "the inner radius of the disk will be less than those radii where the @xmath4mode exists .",
    "again , large amplitude ( rms @xmath152 1% ) features _ can not _ be explained with these modes .",
    "even if the 67 hz feature seen in grs 1915 + 105 does not turn out to be a diskoseismic mode , it points out two important lessons .",
    "first , bhc systems can produce relatively stable , high - frequency features .",
