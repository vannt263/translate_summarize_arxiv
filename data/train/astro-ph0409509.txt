    "the extinction curve describes how the extinction changes with the wavelength .",
    "extinction is due to the presence of dust grains in the interstellar medium and its characteristics are different in a diffuse interstellar medium as compared to a dense interstellar medium .",
    "thus , the knowledge of extinction curve is necessary to deredden magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and to understand the physical properties of dust grains .",
    "* hereafter ccm ) derived a mean extinction law ( for @xmath2 ) that depends on only one parameter @xmath3 .",
    "they considered the sample used in the ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction study of @xcite based on _ international ultraviolet explorer _ extinction curves of 45 reddened milky way ob stars .",
    "ccm searched for the corresponding optical and near - infrared ( ubvrijhkl ) photometry from the literature .",
    "finally they used the intrinsic colors of @xcite for the appropriate spectral types to determine the extinction .",
    "they obtained the following one - parameter family of curves that represents the uv to infrared ( ir ) extinction law in terms of @xmath0 :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the wavelength - dependent coefficients .",
    "equation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) is very powerful because it allows one to determine the extinction in some spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region , given that one knows @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5 ( with a typical value of 3.1 ) when one goes from diffuse to dense interstellar medium . in this formalism",
    "@xmath0 therefore characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction .",
    "many authors used this parameter to study extinction , e.g. : @xcite searched for a relation between @xmath0 and other parameters that characterize the extinction curves ; @xcite studied the role of @xmath0 as the main regulatory agent of the penetration of radiation inside dark clouds ; @xcite discussed different methods to deredden the data and obtained a new estimate of the extinction law in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "* hereafter gs ) applied a @xmath8 minimization to compute the @xmath0 values for a sample of stars with uv extinction data using the linear relation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) . a similar method with weights",
    "was used by @xcite to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 toward a sample of stars with known color excesses in ubvrijhkl .    here",
    "we extend the method used by gs in order to obtain improved @xmath0 values for the lines of sight toward a sample of stars with known extinction data in the uv .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in  [ th.cons .",
    "] we discuss the theoretical basis of our @xmath0 derivation . in  [ data ]",
    "we describe our data sources .",
    "we present the results and assess the consistency between different samples and theoretical approaches in  [ results ] . finally in  [ conclusion ]",
    "we discuss our results and comment on the future work .",
    "the interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes from a few angstroms to a few micrometers . in general",
    ", they reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by two physical processes : absorption and scattering .",
    "the extinction is the result of these two processes .",
    "+ the apparent magnitude @xmath9 of each star as a function of wavelength may be written as @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent absolute magnitude , distance and total extinction , respectively , and subscripts `` red '' and `` comp '' denote reddened and comparison stars , respectively .",
    "the extinction as a function of @xmath15 may be obtained by comparing corresponding stars paired according to spectral properties . in principle , the comparison star should be of the same spectral classification as the reddened star , but with a negligible extinction .",
    "if the reddened star and the comparison star have the same spectral classification it also means that they have very similar intrinsic spectral energy distributions .",
    "thus we have @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath17 .",
    "the magnitude difference obtained from equation ( [ mred ] ) and ( [ mcomp ] ) is therefore :    @xmath18    the quantity @xmath19 is a constant term and may be eliminated by normalizing with respect to extinction difference in two standard wavelengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22    generally , the extinction curves are normalized with respect to the b and v passbands in the @xcite system :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the observed color and @xmath26 is the intrinsic color ( by construction equal to the color of the comparison star ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain the absolute extinction by using the total to selective extinction ratio :    @xmath27    then :    @xmath28    ccm , for computational reasons , divided the complete extinction curve ( equation [ ccmlaw ] ) into three wavelengths regions and fitted the extinction law as a function of @xmath29 : +  infrared ( @xmath30 ) , +  optical / nir ( @xmath31 ) , +  ultraviolet and far - ultraviolet ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "+ for every wavelength , the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 from equation ( [ ccmlaw ] ) are fixed and given by an appropriate expression .",

    "we assumed for simplicity that the errors in @xmath54 and @xmath46 are independent .",
    "however , the values of @xmath47 and their errors for different bands are not independent . to get a good idea about the errors in @xmath0 we compute them in two ways .",
    "first , we calculate the maximum error in @xmath0 , which is the straight sum of errors coming from different sources : @xmath55 then we obtain the error in quadrature which would properly describe total uncertainty if the errors from different sources were uncorrelated :    @xmath56 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\rm bands } } [ ( a(x_i)-1)^2/\\sigma_i^2 ] } \\cdot \\sqrt { \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\\rm bands } } \\left ( \\frac{a(x_j)-1}{\\sigma_j } \\right)^2 } \\label{quaerr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    neither description ( [ errabs ] ) nor ( [ quaerr ] ) is strictly correct : the real error in @xmath0 lies likely between these two estimates .    by definition :    @xmath57    where the second equality is a consequence of equation ( [ rvweighted ] ) .",

    "the sources of the data used to obtain @xmath66 as given by equation ( [ extinction ] ) and their errors are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we also consider another type of error : a ` mismatch error ' , which is caused by the fact that the reddened star and the comparison star may have slightly different colors .",

    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the histograms of the @xmath54 errors for the five ultraviolet bands which we obtain using equation ( [ sigmae ] ) .",

    "this selection results in 923 lines of sight considered previously by gs .",

    "the sample contains stars of spectral type b7 and earlier and this is the reason for which almost all the stars lie in the galactic plane at low latitudes .",

    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the good agreement between the @xmath0 values obtained with gs unweighted method and the weighted method applied here . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath0 values are not so different between the two methods because our adopted errors in @xmath69 are of the same order in the five uv wavelengths .",
    "however , it s important to notice that typical errors in @xmath0 are very different between the two methods ( mostly due to the mismatch errors considered here )",

    "figure [ figure6 ] shows the histogram of the @xmath0 values derived here .",
    "the weighted mean of @xmath0 values is @xmath72 .",
    "we consider systematic errors in extinction curve determination that can result from using biased @xmath46 values . to this aim",
    "we use the wegner s ( 2002 ) calibration of @xmath46 to estimate the effect of the calibration change on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "usually , the extinction curve is expressed in terms of a color excesses to @xmath46 ratio .",
    "since @xmath0 value depends on this ratio ( see equation [ eps ] or [ rvweighted ] ) , the adopted @xmath46 calibration will influence it . since we do not know which set of @xmath46 values is more appropriate [ @xcite or @xcite ] , the difference in obtained @xmath0 values will be a good indicator of a possible systematic error in @xmath0 .",

    "figure [ figure7 ] shows the difference in the @xmath0 values given by different calibrations values is : @xmath77 . ] .",
    "the main effect on @xmath0 comes from the fact that the @xmath46 values from two calibrations differs on average by 0@xmath78.04 in the sense that @xcite color excesses are smaller than the ones used in our primary determination .",

    "using ultraviolet color excesses we find @xmath0 and @xmath1 values and their errors for a sample of 782 lines of sight .",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite by considering various sources of statistical and systematic errors . in a treatment related to the one by ducati et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we introduce the weights associated with the errors in each uv band to our @xmath8 minimization procedure .",
    "we explicitly give all the formulae we use to compute the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values and their errors .",
    "we compute the maximum errors and the errors in quadrature for @xmath0 and @xmath1 taking into account mismatch errors that affect the color excesses to the largest extent .",
    "we present the sky distribution of @xmath0 values and show their behavior as a function of galactic coordinates . finally , we emphasize how @xmath0 values change with different calibrations of @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath0 value may characterize entire extinction curves , extending our study into wavelength regions beyond ultraviolet will provide a check on the universality of ccm law in various parts of the spectrum .",
