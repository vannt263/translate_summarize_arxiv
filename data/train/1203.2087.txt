    "image segmentation aims to partition an image into a  set of nonoverlapping regions so that pixels within the same region are homogeneous with respect to some characteristic ( e.g. , gray value or roughness ) , while pixels from adjacent regions are significantly different with respect to the same characteristic .",
    "it is a fundamental problem in image processing , as very often it is necessary to first group the highly localized pixels into more global and meaningful segmented objects to facilitate the extraction of useful information . in this paper ,",
    "gray value is the image characteristic that forms the basis for segmentation . for general introductions to image segmentation ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a grayscale image can be seen as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface living in a three - dimensional space .",
    "therefore one popular approach to segmenting it is to model it by a 2d piecewise constant function , with the set of all discontinuity points defining the region boundaries of the image .",
    "examples of segmentation methods that follow this approach include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , lee ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as to be demonstrated below , segmenting images with this approach can be recast as a model selection problem , and one crucial issue to its success is the choice of the model complexity , which is equaivalent to choosing the number of regions together with the shapes of their boundaries .",
    "common information theoretic methods such as the akaike information criterion ( aic ) [ @xcite ] , the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , also known as the schwarz information criterion [ @xcite ] and the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle [ rissanen ( @xcite ) ] have been adopted to solve this problem ; for example , see @xcite , @xcite , lee ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while many of these methods produce excellent practical results , their theoretical properties are still largely unknown .",
    "the goal of this paper is to conduct a systematic study on the theoretical properties of these methods , with the hope of enhancing our understanding of their performances , at both theoretical and empirical levels . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that such a rigorous theoretical study is being performed for image segmentation methods .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "background material is presented in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "section [ secmain ] presents our main theoretical results .",
    "these theoretical results are empirically verified by numerical experiments in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "concluding remarks are offered in section [ sec5 ] , while technical details are delayed to the .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the true image and @xmath1 the set of @xmath2 grid points at which a noisy version of @xmath0 is sampled . without loss of generality",
    "it is assumed that the domain of @xmath0 is @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] . as mentioned before",
    ",  @xmath0 is modeled as a 2d piecewise constant function as follows .",
    "write @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let the number of regions ( or pieces or segments ) in  @xmath0 be  @xmath6 , and denote the gray value and domain of the @xmath7th region as  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "then we have , for @xmath10 , @xmath11 ^ 2\\quad \\mbox{and}\\quad r_\\nu\\cap r_{\\nu^\\prime}=\\varnothing\\qquad\\mbox{if } \\nu\\not=\\nu ^\\prime.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the sequel we write @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath14 defines a segmentation of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed noisy version @xmath15 of  @xmath16 is modeled as @xmath17 where the noise @xmath18 s are independent , identically distributed random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath19 .",
    "given @xmath20 , the goal is then to estimate  @xmath16 , which is equivalent to estimating @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath21",
    ".    for simplicity , denote by @xmath22 a generic parameter vector .",
    "estimating @xmath16 is hence equivalent to the model selection problem in which each model is determined by the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the corresponding residual sum of squares .",
    "notice that different values of @xmath6 would lead to a different number of parameters in @xmath23 . also notice that @xmath23 can not be estimated by minimizing @xmath25 , as @xmath25 can be made arbitrarily small as @xmath6 tends to @xmath2 .",
    "one way to resolve this issue is to add a penalty term to @xmath25 to suitably penalize the complexity of @xmath23 . as alluded to before ,",
    "information theoretic model selection methods like aic , bic and mdl can be used to derive such a penalty .",
    "we first focus on the mdl criterion derived by @xcite , @xmath26 where each region @xmath9 enters through its `` area '' @xmath27 ( in terms of number of pixels ) and `` perimeter '' @xmath28 ( in terms of number of pixel edges ) .",
    "these quantities are formally defined as @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 indicating , respectively , cardinality and boundary of the set @xmath32 .",
    "observe that , once the estimates @xmath33 and @xmath34 are specified , @xmath21 can be uniquely estimated by @xmath35 and therefore @xmath21 is dropped in the argument list of @xmath36 . to sum up ,",
    "the mdl - based method of @xcite estimates @xmath6 and @xmath14 as the joint minimizer of  ( [ eq2 ] ) , which is equivalent to saying @xmath37 and @xmath38 is given by ( [ eqmuhat ] ) .",
    "practical algorithms , developed , for example , by @xcite and @xcite , can be used to solve ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "one can also use aic and bic to derive penalty terms to add to @xmath39 , and the resulting penalties will be proportional to the number of `` free '' ( and independent ) parameters in the fitted image @xmath40 [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "this leads to the following question : what would be a meaningful way of counting the number of free parameters in @xmath40 ?",
    "there seems to be no unique answer , but we shall follow @xcite and @xcite and model each true pixel value @xmath41 with a  mixture distribution of @xmath6 gaussians , where the mean , variance and mixing probability for the @xmath7th gaussian are @xmath8 , @xmath19 and @xmath42 , respectively . as there are @xmath6 of the @xmath8 s , one @xmath19 and @xmath43 free mixing probabilities , the total number of free parameters is @xmath44 . with this , the corresponding aic and bic segmentation criteria are @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the aic and bic estimates for @xmath47 are then given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "observe that for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the region boundaries @xmath14 are not explicitly penalized ; they enter the criteria only through @xmath39 .",
    "also observe that the penalty term of @xmath50 is independent of  @xmath2 .",
    "before we proceed further , it is worthwhile to point out a major difference between the variable selection problem in linear regression models and the image segmentation problem . in variable selection for linear regression ,",
    "the goal is to select the significant predictors and remove the insignificant ones from the model .",
    "in other words , some `` data '' are not used in estimating the model parameters . for image segmentation ,",
    "the goal is to group homogeneous pixels together to form segmented objects , and in this process all data ( i.e. , all pixel values ) are always used to estimate the model parameters .",
    "given this major difference , one can see that variable selection in linear regression and image segmentation are two different problems , and hence existing theories from classical linear regression modeling can not be directly applied to image segmentation .",
    "this section presents our main theoretical findings .",
    "briefly , both the bic and mdl segmentation solutions are statistically consistent in a well - defined sense , while the aic solution is not .",
    "the consistency of the bic and mdl solutions are investigated at two levels .",
    "first , we will establish the strong consistency of @xmath34 if the true number of regions @xmath52 can be assumed known .",
    "second , if the true value @xmath53 is unknown and if the noise is restricted to be gaussian , we will establish the weak consistency of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . while the existence of a true underlying model was not essential for the practical use of ( [ eq3])([eqbicestimate ] )",
    ", we will , in this section , assume that the image of interest is indeed of the form ( [ eq1a])([eq1b ] ) and shall denote the associated true gray values and segmentation by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .    in order to enable large sample results ,",
    "we impose further technical conditions .",
    "first , to ensure sufficient separation of the regions and to avoid sets of zero ( lebesgue ) measure in the decomposition of @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , it will be assumed throughout that each @xmath56 contains an open ball of suitably small radius : for all @xmath57 , there is @xmath58 and @xmath59 such that @xmath60 ^ 2\\colon\\|{\\mathbf{z}}-{\\mathbf{z}}_\\nu\\| < \\epsilon\\}\\subset r_\\nu^0\\ ] ] with denoting euclidean norm on @xmath61 .",
    "all candidate segmentations @xmath14 from which the estimate @xmath62 is produced in any of ( [ eq3 ] ) to ( [ eqbicestimate ] ) are restricted to satisfy the same condition .",
    "next , we assume that the set of grid points @xmath63 is dense in @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] in the sense that , for all @xmath59 , there is an @xmath64 such that @xmath65 ^ 2\\subset\\bigcup_{i=1}^nb_\\epsilon({\\mbox{$x$}}_i ) \\qquad\\mbox{for all } n\\geq n_0.\\ ] ]    last , we assume further that the number of grid points in any given region grows with the sample size ( at the same linear rate ) and therefore require that @xmath66 with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the integer part .",
    "we first consider the mdl segmentation solution ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "suppose for now that @xmath52 is known , and let @xmath69 . in this case , we have the following strong consistency result .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath70 be the sequence of random variables specified in  ( [ eqyi ] ) , and assume that @xmath52 is known",
    ". then @xmath71    the almost sure convergence in the theorem is defined as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath72 the lexicographical order in @xmath61 , that is , @xmath73 if and only if either @xmath74 or @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we assume throughout that any segmentation @xmath12 satisfies @xmath77 , where  @xmath78  if and only if there is @xmath79 such that @xmath80 for all . for two sets  @xmath32 and @xmath81",
    ", let now @xmath82 be their symmetric difference . denote by @xmath83 the  lebesgue measure in @xmath61 restricted to @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] and set @xmath84 . then , we mean by @xmath85 with probability one that @xmath86 . in other words ,",
    "the lebesgue measure of the random sets @xmath87 is zero in the limit with probability one .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] below can be found in the .",
    "of course , in practice , the assumption that @xmath53 is known is unrealistic .",
    "establishing consistency in the general case of unknown @xmath53 is , however , substantially more difficult . even in the simpler univariate change - point frameworks , where independent variables are grouped into segments of identical distributions , only special cases such as normal distributions and exponential families",
    "have been thoroughly investigated ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that sharp tail estimates for maxima of certain squared gaussian processes are needed which do not hold for distributions with thicker tails .",
    "see lemma [ lem6 ] below for more details . nevertheless , if we assume the noise is normally distributed , we are able to establish the following consistency result .",
    "[ th2 ] let @xmath70 be the sequence of random variables specified in  ( [ eqyi ] ) and assume that the @xmath88 are normally distributed",
    ". then @xmath89 and @xmath90 even if the true value @xmath52 is unknown .",
    "here @xmath91 indicates convergence in probability .",
    "the second convergence in probability is defined as follows .",
    "let now @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "then , in analogy to the almost sure convergence above , we use the terminology @xmath94 to mean that @xmath95 . in words , theorem [ th2 ] asserts that , if the noise @xmath18 is normal , the mdl method is capable of recovering the true number of regions as well as the region boundaries as the number of pixels in the image goes to infinity .",
    "@xmath96the results stated in theorems  [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] also hold for the bic solution given by ( [ eqbicestimate ] )",
    ". this statement can be proofed by modifying the proofs for theorems  [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] .",
    "details can be found in the .",
    "while being consistent in the special case of known @xmath52 , the aic solution given by ( [ eqaicestimate ] ) is , however , inconsistent in the general case .",
    "the main reason is that its penalty term ,  @xmath6 , is independent of the sample size @xmath2 and does not properly adjust for the model complexity .",
    "some details are provided in the .",
    "two sets of simulation experiments were conducted to empirically verify the theoretical results presented above .",
    "three test images @xmath0 were used in the first simulation experiment , and they are displayed in the top row of figure [ figimage ] . recall that the area and perimeter of each region appear explicitly in the mdl penalty  ( [ eq2 ] ) , but not the aic nor the bic penalty . to assess the effects of having or not having such quantities as penalty ,",
    "the three test images were constructed to have different region areas , perimeters and area - to - perimeter ratios .",
    "test image 1 has seven square regions of two different sizes , with true gray values for some of the adjacent regions being very close .",
    "test image 2 contains eight rectangular regions of same size , with true gray values increasing from the left to the right .",
    "test image 3 contains four regions of different sizes and shapes .",
    "noisy images were generated by adding gaussian white noise with variance @xmath19 to each of the test images .",
    "three signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) were used : 1 , 2 and 4 , where snr is defined as @xmath97 . some typical noisy images are also displayed in figure [ figimage ] .",
    "note that for @xmath98 some of the region boundaries are hardly visible .",
    "four image sizes were used : @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and the number of repetitions for each configuration was  500 .",
    "( second row ) , 2 ( third row ) and 4 ( last row ) .",
    "all images are plotted with size @xmath102 . ]    for each noisy image , the aic , bic and mdl segmentation solutions  ( [ eq3 ] ) to ( [ eqbicestimate ] ) were obtained using the merging algorithm in @xcite . to verify the result that @xmath103 ( theorem [ th2 ] ) , the number of regions in each segmentation solution was counted and the corresponding frequencies are tabulated in tables [ tableregion1 ] to [ tableregion3 ] . from these tables",
    "the following empirical conclusions can be made :    * aic had a strong tendency to over - estimate @xmath53 . *",
    "the performance of bic improved as @xmath2 increased , and occasionally it over - estimated @xmath53 . * for reasonably large snr and @xmath2 ,",
    "mdl always correctly estimated @xmath53 . * for small snr and @xmath2 , mdl under - estimated @xmath53 . as mentioned before , for such cases some of the region boundaries are hardly visible ( see figure [ figimage ] ) . *",
    "when comparing the bic and mdl results , especially from table [ tableregion3 ] , it seems that having the region area and perimeter in the penalty improved the performance .",

    "therefore , we applied the mdl criterion to segment the image , as the simulation results above suggest that both aic and bic would heavily oversegment the image . the mdl segmented result , which consists of 34 segmented regions , is given in figure [ figsegmrsar](b ) .",
    "even though a gaussian noise assumption may not be appropriate for this sar image , the mdl criterion produced a reasonable segmentation .",
    "the most apparent weakness of the segmentation is the roughness of the boundaries ( many of which should clearly be straight ) and the failure to detect some narrow regions",
