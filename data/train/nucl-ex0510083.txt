    "the primary physics goal of alice is the study of the properties of qcd matter at the energy densities of several hundred times the density of atomic nuclei that will be reached in central  collisions . under these conditions a deconfined state of quarks and gluons",
    "is expected to be formed .",
    "heavy quarks , and hard partons in general , would probe this medium via the mechanism of qcd energy loss .",
    "in particular , measuring the high-@xmath0 suppression of beauty hadrons and comparing it to that of light - flavour and charm hadrons , would allow us to investigate the predicted quark - mass dependence of parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "besides energy loss studies , the measurement of the beauty cross section provides the normalization for quarkonia production , needed to address medium effects on quarkonia .",
    "beauty decays with an electron in the final state have a ` global ' branching ratio of @xmath5 : @xmath6 for direct semi - electronic decays , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for semi - electronic decays via a charm hadron , @xmath9  @xcite . the heavy - flavour production yields in pb ",

    "the expected yields of beauty hadrons and beauty - decay electrons in a 05% central pb ",
    "pb collision at @xmath10 are about 9.0 and 1.9 , respectively , of which about 1/4 within the alice central barrel acceptance @xmath11 .    as in central collisions at the lhc between 3000 and 10000 charged hadrons",
    "may be produced in the region @xmath11 , high - performance electron identification will be necessary . in alice , a combined selection on @xmath12 , measured in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and transition radiation , measured in the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , is expected reject 99.99% of the pions ( @xmath13 misidentification probability ) and 100% of the heavier hadrons , while correctly tagging 80% of the electrons .",
    "the main sources of background electrons are : decays of primary d mesons , which have a branching ratio of @xmath14 in the semi - electronic channels  @xcite , and an expected production yield larger by a factor about 20 with respect to that of b mesons  @xcite ; @xmath15 dalitz decays and decays of light mesons ( mainly @xmath16 , @xmath17 , k ) ; conversions of photons in the beam pipe or in the inner layer of the inner tracking system ( its ) , and pions misidentified as electrons .",
    "given that electrons from beauty have average transverse impact parameter ( distance of closest approach to the interaction vertex in the plane transverse to the beam direction ) @xmath18 , it is possible to minimize the background contributions by selecting electron tracks displaced from the primary vertex .",
    "tracking in the tpc and its , that includes two layers of silicon pixel detectors , provides a measurement of the impact parameter with a resolution @xmath19\\approx 11 + 53/({p_{\\rm t}}\\,[{\\mathrm{gev}}/c])$ ] , i.e.better than @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 distributions reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0andstat ] ( left ) show that a lower cut on the impact parameter allows to reject misidentified @xmath23 and @xmath24 from dalitz decays and photon conversions ( the former mostly come from the primary vertex and the latter have small impact parameter for @xmath25 ) .",
    "as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : d0andstat ] ( left ) , the impact parameter cut @xmath26 is expected to give a b / c ratio larger than unity for the electron sample with @xmath21 .",
    "this cut also removes most of the background electrons from @xmath15 dalitz decays and @xmath27 conversions , as well as the primary @xmath23 misidentified as electrons .",

    "beauty electrons are expected above @xmath30 in @xmath0 , allowing the measurement of the @xmath0-differential cross section in the range @xmath31 .",
    "the residual contamination of about 10% of electrons from prompt charm decays , from misidentified charged pions and @xmath27-conversion electrons is accumulated in the low-@xmath0 region .    after applying the @xmath22 cut , in a given @xmath0 interval [ e.g.the bins in fig  [ fig : d0andstat ] ( right ) ] , @xmath32",

    "the following procedure is foreseen to extract the cross section of electrons from beauty .",
    "1 .   subtraction of charm decay electrons .",
    "we plan to use the cross section for @xmath34 mesons , measured in alice in the @xmath35 decay channel  @xcite , to estimate the @xmath36 contribution .",
    "this will introduce a systematic error coming from the statistical and systematic errors on the @xmath34 cross section .",
    "the error is expected to be smaller than 5% for @xmath37 .",
    "2 .   subtraction of the remaining background electrons and misidentified pions , on the basis of monte carlo simulations tuned on the measured light - flavour hadron production .",
    "this subtraction also introduces a systematic error , which we currently assume to be small , i.e.negligible with respect to other error sources .",
    "correction of the number of beauty electrons , @xmath38 , for efficiency ( @xmath22 cut , electron i d , tracking ) and acceptance : @xmath39 .",
    "the correction will be done via monte carlo and we assume a systematic error of about 10% on the correction factor @xmath40 .",
    "4 .   normalization of the corrected yield to a cross section for beauty electrons per binary collision in a given pb  pb centrality class ( e.g.05% ) , @xmath41 . for the 05% class , a systematic error of about 9%",
