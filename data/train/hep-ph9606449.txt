    "<S> it is an extremely important task to verify or exclude a gluino in this light window experimentally . while the tevatron run ii is expected to extend the reach of heavy gluinos up to a few hundred gev , little effort is devoted to definitively exclude or verify the light gluino window . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a careful reexamination of the existent data may reveal an overlooked constraint on a light gluino ; this is our motivation to study the existent data in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyzed published data on @xmath2 decays into four jets @xcite , and found that they already exclude a gluino lighter than 1.5  gev@xmath1 at more than 90% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the gluino does not decay inside the detector . </S>",
    "<S> since the published results use only 1991 and 1992 data , it is conceivable that the currently available data , if analyzed properly , could put a much more significant constraint on a light gluino . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our result urges the experimental groups to analyze the whole data set including a possible light gluino .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly review the existent constraints on a light gluino ( see @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the negative searches at beam dump experiments have excluded a light gluino which decays inside the detector into photino , which in turn interacts with the neutrino detector . however </S>",
    "<S> , a gluino tends to leave the detector without decaying if the squark mass is above a few hundred gev@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if the gluino decays , the photino interacts very weakly in this case and can not be detected . </S>",
    "<S> if the gluino does not decay , it forms bound states such as gluinoball @xmath6 , glueballino @xmath7 or baryon - like states , especially @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other states are likely to decay into these neutral bound states , and searches for exotic charged hadrons may not apply unless a charged gluino bound state decays only weakly . </S>",
    "<S> one the other hand , the mass region above 1.5  gev@xmath1 and below 4  gev@xmath1 is excluded from quarkonium decay @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pseudo - scalar gluinoball , independent of the gluino lifetime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether the bound extends to lower masses is controversial because of the applicability of perturbative qcd calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass range above 4  gev@xmath1 is expected to give a shorter lifetime and is excluded by a negative search for events with missing energy at ua1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite claim that the limit from ua1 extends down to 3  gev@xmath1 . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> the least constrained region is the mass range below 1.5  gev@xmath1 , where the gluino is relatively stable so that it does not decay inside detectors . </S>",
    "<S> this is our window of interest in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that the best method to exclude the gluino mass range below 1.5  gev@xmath1 is to use inclusive processes rather than searching for specific bound states with certain decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> the latter search would heavily depend on assumptions such as the mass spectrum of various gluino bound states and their decay modes and decay lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> one would have to design experiments and put constraints with all possible theoretical assumptions on gluino bound states in order to exclude the light gluino definitively . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the constraints would be much less sensitive to theoretical assumptions if they were based on inclusive processes where perturbative qcd is applicable . </S>",
    "<S> there are several possibilities pointed out in the literature along this line . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular one is to study the effect of light gluinos in the running of the qcd coupling constant @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it was even pointed out that the values of @xmath11 from higher energy measurements tend to be higher than those extrapolated from lower energies using qcd with the ordinary quark flavors , and the data actually prefer the existence of a light gluino to compensate the slight discrepancy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this issue remains controversial @xcite . even though the discrepancy between low - energy and high - energy measurements is diminishing @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> still the data are not precise enough to exclude or verify a light gluino definitively . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is its effect on the altarelli  </S>",
    "<S> parisi evolution of the nucleon structure functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the effect is too small to be tested using the present experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it might be that the more recent hera data could improve the situation , but making a definite statement on the existence of a light gluino appears to be difficult . </S>",
    "<S> the third one is to study the angular correlations in the so - called `` 3 + 1 '' jet events at hera @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of the light gluino was found to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the final one , which we employ in this letter , is the study of four jet correlations in @xmath12 collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies did not find significant constraints , but given the size of the current lep data , we find this to be the most promising direction .    </S>",
    "<S> the only data we use in this letter are studies of qcd color factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental groups at lep have performed impressive analyses of the hadronic @xmath2 decays into four jets , extracting qcd color factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite from jet angular distributions , to confirm su(3 ) as the qcd gauge group and five light quark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distributions of @xmath15 final state differ from those of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 refers to a generic quark and @xmath18 to a gluon . </S>",
    "<S> three angles are commonly used in four - jet analyses : the bengtsson  zerwas ( bz ) angle @xmath19 @xcite , the modified nachtmann  reiter ( nr ) angle @xmath20 @xcite , and the opening angle of the two less energetic jets @xmath21 . if there exists a light gluino @xmath22 , the final state @xmath23 also contributes to the @xmath2 decays into four jets . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distributions of @xmath23 would be identical to those of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a possible light gluino would change the extracted @xmath14 but not @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the mass effects , @xmath14 should increase by a factor of @xmath24 , because the gluino is a color - octet and counts effectively as three additional massless quarks . </S>",
    "<S> note that these analyses do not use the overall rate of four - jet events since it is sensitive to the choice of @xmath25 in the absence of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> so far the experimental analysis which used the highest statistics is the one by opal @xcite , which also briefly discussed constraints on a light gluino . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the light gluino is barely outside the 68% confidence level contour and decided the data did not put a significant constraint .    </S>",
    "<S> however , we find the previous analyses not carefully designed to study the effect of a light gluino because of the following reason . when one discusses a possible light gluino , qcd with the color group su(3 ) should be assumed . </S>",
    "<S> given overwhelming experimental evidences of qcd , it is not wise to , for instance , vary the number of colors @xmath26 when one studies the effect of a particle ( light gluino ) _ added to _ qcd . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we must fix the qcd color factor @xmath13 to be that of the su(3 ) group , 9/4 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we already _ know _ that there are five quark flavors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which appear in @xmath2 hadronic decays . </S>",
    "<S> when one puts constraints on an _ additional _ contribution from a light gluino , one should not vary the number of flavors below 5 , or equivalently , @xmath14 below 3/8 . </S>",
    "<S> the only lep paper which analyzed data in a way close to this spirit , and put an upper bound on possible additional @xmath15-type final states , is the one from opal @xcite ; but it used very limited statistics . </S>",
    "<S> all more recent papers @xcite varied both @xmath13 and @xmath14 without constraints . by reanalyzing data with these constraints we can put a much more significant bound on a light gluino than reported . actually , fixing the group to be su(3 ) ( @xmath32 ) has the greatest impact on the confidence level , while restricting @xmath33 has a much smaller effect ( actually it makes the significance worse ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further include the finite mass of the bottom quark in the analysis which slightly improves the significance . </S>",
    "<S> overall , a massless gluino is excluded already better than at 90% confidence level by the opal 1991 and 1992 data only @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start from the reported contour on the @xmath13 , @xmath14 plane , shown in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> . we fix @xmath34 because of the philosophy of our study stated above . </S>",
    "<S> since one - dimensional @xmath35 distributions have much higher confidence levels than two - dimensional ones , this change improves the significance of the data drastically . from their @xmath35 contours , we minimized @xmath35 with fixed @xmath32 , and defined @xmath36 relative to the @xmath35 at the minimum ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the confidence levels are calculated using a one - dimensional @xmath35 distribution with @xmath36 defined in this manner . </S>",
    "<S> this is a conservative choice because @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath39 with fixed @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> if one had used this central value and the standard deviation , a massless gluino would be excluded at 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also need to impose another constraint , @xmath40 , which can be easily taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the standard method is to use the gaussian distribution only in the physical region , and scale the normalization of the distribution so that the total probability in the physical region becomes unity . since the central value is very close to the theoretical value of the qcd , this effectively increases the probability of allowing light gluinos by a factor of two ; numerically the confidence level is 88% .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the effect of the finite mass of the bottom quark and gluinos on the extracted @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite studied the effect of the finite mass of quarks on the four - jet rates . </S>",
    "<S> they also looked at the angular distributions and reported there were little changes . </S>",
    "<S> even though it is true that the distributions do not change drastically , they gradually become similar to those of @xmath16 final state as one increases the mass of the quark , and hence the extracted @xmath14 from the fit to the distributions has a relatively large effect due to the finite mass of the bottom quark . </S>",
    "<S> the papers @xcite do not take this effect into account at all . the opal experiment @xcite used parton level event generators by the authors of @xcite and @xcite to study the effect . </S>",
    "<S> they have found a surprisingly large effect : the bottom quark contribution to @xmath14 was about one half of a massless quark at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed their estimate in a detailed parton - level calculation based on that done in @xcite , neglecting the interference between primary and secondary quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is known to be better than a few percent . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this approximation has the clear advantage of enabling us to distinguish primary and secondary quarks unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> our code employs helicity amplitude technique using the helas package @xcite , which made it straight - forward to incorporate finite masses in the four - jet distributions .    the finite mass affects the extracted @xmath14 in two ways </S>",
    "<S> first , the rate of producing secondary massive quarks is suppressed compared to the massless case as shown with the solid line in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , there is about 20% suppression with @xmath42  gev@xmath1 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the primary quark has little effect on the rate : only a 6% suppression for @xmath44  gev@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked that the distributions in bz and nr angles with a massive primary quark are indistinguishable from the massless case . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are consistent with naive expectations , because the primary quarks are much more energetic than the secondary ones and hence the mass effect is suppressed by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore neglect the finite mass of primary quarks hereafter . </S>",
    "<S> second , the nr and bz angle distributions gradually approach those of the @xmath16 final state as one increases the mass of the secondary quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we are not aware of detailed analyses of these distributions with massive quarks in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions are shown in fig .  3 normalized so that the total area below the curve is unity , in order for the effect on the rate and that on the distribution to be clearly separated . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the distributions as linear combinations of @xmath16 and massless @xmath15 distributions to determine the _ effective _ @xmath14 , in order to mimic the experimental analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is surprisingly good ; we checked this for quark masses between 0 and 5  gev@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the reduction in the rate , the net effect of the finite mass of secondary quarks is shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath46  gev@xmath1 for secondary bottom quarks , the overall rate of @xmath47 final state is reduced to 82.5% , while the fit to angular distributions gives a @xmath14 reduced to 76.4% ( bz ) or 85.5% ( nr ) compared to that of a massless quark flavor ( 3/8 ) , on top of the reduction in the rate . in total , secondary bottom quarks contribute to @xmath14 as @xmath48 or @xmath49 , which is not a negligible suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath14 from the data is an average of @xmath14 from five flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the reported @xmath14 in @xcite includes a correction to compensate the apparent suppression due to the finite bottom quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> such a correction in turn effectively enhances the additional contribution from gluinos by a factor of @xmath50 or @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this slight enhancement effect does not change significantly even when one varies @xmath52 from 4 to 5  gev@xmath1 , as can be seen in fig .  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual opal analysis @xcite fits the data in the three dimensional space spanned by bz , nr and @xmath21 angles after bin - by - bin systematic corrections from monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis is beyond the scope of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the total effect of the finite mass is somewhere between the effects on bz or nr angles since @xmath21 is not as effective in extracting @xmath14 . as it is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , fits to distributions of massive quarks give apparent additional contributions to @xmath16 and hence @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> they are completely negligible , however , compared to the size of the true @xmath16 which is about one order of magnitude larger than the sum of all @xmath15 final states , and hence we will neglect such contributions hereafter .    given the above considerations , we can now present the exclusion confidence levels on a light gluino for varying gluino masses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . for both curves </S>",
    "<S> , we used @xmath53  gev@xmath1 and used the effective @xmath14 extracted from the fits to bz and nr angles . </S>",
    "<S> the finite mass effect of the gluino is treated in the same manner . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it is clear that the finite mass effect which we studied depends little on the choice of bz or nr angles , and hence we believe it mimics the true experimental fits ( which use bz , nr and @xmath21 angles simultaneously in a three - dimensional fit with 295 bins ) quite well . </S>",
    "<S> second , the confidence level is extremely flat up to 2  gev@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that we do not need to worry about complication due to non - perturbative dynamics in defining the gluino mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound of @xmath54  gev@xmath1 at 90% confidence level is already in the perturbative region . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite likely that the gluino mass relevant to this analysis is a running mass defined at the scale @xmath55 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is then straight - forward to convert the bound to the on - shell gluino mass : the lower bound of @xmath56  gev@xmath1 in the @xmath57 scheme corresponds to @xmath58  gev@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to comment that the clever jet reconstruction method used in the opal analysis @xcite is particularly suited for the study of light gluinos in four - jet events . </S>",
    "<S> they did not scale the measured jet energies by an overall ratio @xmath59 , as done traditionally in similar analyses , but instead used the angular information of the jets to calculate the energy of each jet using energy and momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> this method avoids uncertainties in the gluino fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> since it is not well understood how a gluino fragments , one should use a similar method to avoid dependence on assumptions about the gluino fragmentation in future studies .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , our analysis is limited to the leading - order ( lo ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is a natural question whether the nlo corrections may change our conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we expect that the corrections to the angular variables used in the analysis are presumably not large . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections are important when a variable involves @xmath25 , such as 3- and 4-jet rates , thrust , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the variables used in our analysis are not proportional to powers of @xmath25 , and hence scale - independent at the lo approximations . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to the case of the forward - backward asymmetry which is an ( integrated ) angular variable and is @xmath25 independent at the lo . it does receive an nlo correction of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 in the case of a massless quark @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , we also expect a correction to the angular distributions of the order of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is probably an educated guess </S>",
    "<S> . then a typical size of the nlo correction is about 5  % . </S>",
    "<S> however , a correction of this order of magnitude may still be of concern because of the following reason . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 final state is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath15 final state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a 5% correction to @xmath16 may result in a 50% correction to @xmath15 final state , to be compared with a possible 60  % contribution from the gluino .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue , however , that such a higher order correction is not likely to change our conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the helicity structure and the color flow in the @xmath16 final state and @xmath15 final state are quite different . if a correction to the @xmath16 final state changes the conclusion , the following must be happening : the correction term to the @xmath16 exactly mimics an additional contribution to the @xmath15 final state in the angular distributions with a negative sign such as to mask the contribution from the @xmath23 final state . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find this to be likely because they have different structures in the helicities and colors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the data do not indicate that the nlo correction is large . </S>",
    "<S> opal data @xcite are fit very well by the lo monte carlo on three - dimensional histograms of 295 bins with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this excellent agreement between the matrix element calculation and the data found in @xcite supports the smallness of the nlo corrections empirically . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculations of nlo corrections are necessary to justify it . </S>",
    "<S> expansion is small @xcite . ] for future studies , it is also desirable to compare different monte carlo programs , while only jetset was used in recent experimental papers @xcite .    finally , it is worth emphasizing that the result in this letter is based on the 1991 and 1992 opal data with 1.1 m hadronic @xmath2 s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical and systematic uncertainties are comparable in their paper . given the current size of the lep data , which is more than an order of magnitude larger , the statistical uncertainty should reduce substantially once all of the data has been analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> this change alone could drastically improve the sensitivity to the light gluino in four - jet events . on the other hand , it is not obvious how systematic uncertainties can be further reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the largest systematic uncertainty originates in the bin - by - bin acceptance corrections which needed to be done before performing a fit in bz , nr , and the opening angle space . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear how this uncertainty can be reduced if one employs the same method . perhaps choosing larger values of @xmath65 reduces the uncertainty while reducing the statistics at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> there could be an optimal choice of @xmath65 for this particular purpose . </S>",
    "<S> some of the other large systematic uncertainties are specific to the opal experiment and could be reduced by averaging results from all four experiments . in any case , there is no doubt that we can expect a better result from the currently available data set .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyzed the published opal 1991 and 1992 data on the qcd color factors @xcite to constrain possible additional contributions to four - jet events in @xmath2 decays due to @xmath23 final states . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference from the original opal study is to fix @xmath34 as required by qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we further imposed @xmath66 and treated the finite mass effects of both the bottom quark and the gluino carefully . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a light gluino with a mass below 1.5  gev@xmath1 is excluded at better than 90% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the result is insensitive to assumptions about what bound state it forms , the definition of its mass , and the gluino fragmentation provided that it does not decay inside the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the currently available data set is much more sensitive to a possible additional contribution from the light gluino . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that the nlo corrections are unlikely to modify the conclusion ; still , this assertion needs to be justified by explicit calculations in the future . </S>",
    "<S> as a by - product of this analysis , we discussed the effect of finite bottom quark mass on bz and nr distributions in detail , which is not negligible when extracting qcd color factors at current precisions . </S>"
