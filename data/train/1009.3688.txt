    "supersymmetric solutions in supergravity have played an important rle in the development of string theory and the anti - de sitter(ads)/conformal field theory ( cft)-correspondence .",
    "a pioneer work in this direction was the great success of microscopic deviation of black hole entropy from the viewpoint of intersecting d - branes . by virtue of the saturation of bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) bound",
    ", the supersymmetric solutions can provide arena for exploring the non - perturbative limits of string theory .",
    "the bps equality constraints the supersymmetry variation spinor to satisfy the 1st - order differential equation .",
    "such a covariantly constant spinor is called a killing spinor , which ensures that the energy is positively bounded by central charges , guaranteeing the stability of the theory .",
    "the relationship between vacuum stability and bps states was suggested by witten s positive energy theorem  @xcite , and later validated firmly by  @xcite .    from a standpoint of pure gravitating object ,",
    "black hole solutions admitting a killing spinor are sharply distinguished from non - bps black hole solutions .",
    "these bps configurations are dynamically very simple .",
    "first of all , bps black hole solutions necessarily have zero hawking temperature ( the converse is not true ) , implying that the horizon is degenerate .",
    "accordingly they are free from thermal excitation .",
    "such a non - bifurcating horizon universally admits a throat infinity and enhanced isometries of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "secondly , most bps solutions satisfy `` no - force '' condition .",
    "for example , we are able to superpose the extreme reissner - nordstrm solutions at our disposal due to the delicate compensation between the gravitational attractive force and the electromagnetic repulsive force .",
    "the resulting multicenter metric , originally found by majumdar and papapetrou , maintains static equilibrium and describes collection of charged black holes  @xcite .",
    "this property can be ascribed to the complete linearization of field equations . besides these , all the bps",
    "black holes are known to be strictly stationary , viz , the ergoregion does not exist even if the black hole has nonvanishing angular momentum .",
    "dynamically evolving states are not compatible with supersymmetry .",
    "then , to what extent these known intuitive properties continue to hold ? motivated by this inquiry it is important to explore general properties and classify bps solutions .",
    "a first progress was made by tod , who catalogued all the bps solutions admitting nontrivial killing spinors of 4-dimensional @xmath2 supergravity  @xcite , inspired by the early study of gibbons and hull  @xcite .",
    "recently , gauntlett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were able to obtain general supersymmetric solutions in 5-dimensional minimal supergravity exploiting bilinears constructed from a killing spinor .",
    "since their technique has no restriction upon the spacetime dimensionality , reference  @xcite has sparked a considerable development in the classifications of supersymmetric solutions in various supergravities  @xcite .",
    "this formalism is useful for finding supersymmetric black holes  @xcite and black rings  @xcite , and for proving uniqueness theorem of certain black holes  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all the bps black holes fulfill above mentioned properties except for the equilibrium condition which is valid only in the ungauged case .    on the other hand ,",
    "non - bps black hole solutions  especially the time - dependent black hole solutions  have been much less understood . in this paper",
    "we address some properties of cosmological black - hole solutions which have an interpretation as arising from the gauged supergravity with non - compact r - symmetry gauged .",
    "the most simplest theory is the 4-dimensional minimal de sitter supergravity consisting of the graviton , the maxwell fields and a _ positive _ cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent solution in this theory was found by kastor and traschen  @xcite , which is the generalization of majumdar - papapetrou solution in the de sitter background .",
    "the kastor - traschen solution describes coalescing black holes in the contracting de sitter universe ( or splitting white holes in the expanding de sitter universe ) and inherits some salient characteristics from the majumdar - papapetrou solution .",
    "the reason why multicenter metric is in mechanical equilibrium irrespective of the time - dependence is attributed to the first - order `` bps equation '' that extremizes the action , allowing the complete linearization of field equations .",
    "since these `` bps '' states are not truly supersymmetric in the usual sense , they are referred to as pseudo - supersymmetric and the corresponding theory is called a `` fake '' supergravity .",
    "recently , all pseudo - supersymmetric solutions in 4- and 5-dimensional fake de sitter fake supergravity were classified using the spinorial geometry method  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a non - abelian generalization ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss properties of pseudo - supersymmetric solutions of 5-dimensional fake supergravity with arbitrary number of @xmath0 gauge fields and scalar fields .",
    "some time - dependent black hole solutions in this theory have been available so far  @xcite , but their properties and causal structures are yet to be explored . even for the simplest case",
    "in which the harmonic function is sourced by a single point mass , the spacetime is highly dynamical except in the de sitter supergravity . in the present case",
    "the background spacetime is the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology .",
    "( in the context of fake supergravity , it is argued that the flrw cosmologies are duals of supersymmetric domain walls .",
    "see  @xcite for details . )",
    "a series of recent papers of present authors  @xcite revealed that the solution of a single point source found in  @xcite actually describes a charged black hole in the flrw cosmology . though the metric in  @xcite were shown to be the exact solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton system , we show in this paper that the 5-dimensional solutions of  @xcite in fact satisfy the 1st - order bps equation in fake supergravity .",
    "the pseudo - supersymmetry is indeed consistent with an expanding universe .",
    "this work will establish new insights for black holes in time - dependent and non - supersymmetric backgrounds .",
    "the main concern in this paper is to see the effects of black - hole rotation in 5-dimensions by restricting to the single point mass case .",
    "as it turns out , rotation makes the properties of spacetime much richer .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe a fake supergravity model and derive ( in a gauge different from  @xcite ) a rotating , time - dependent solution preserving the pseudo - supersymmetry .",
    "section  [ sec : bhs ] is devoted to explore physical and geometrical properties of the spacetime .",
    "we establish that the black hole horizon is generated by a rotating killing horizon , in sharp contrast with the supersymmetric black - hole horizon which admits a non - rotating degenerate killing horizon without an ergoregion .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the solution generally admits closed timelike curves in the vicinity of timelike singularities ( with trivial fundamental group ) . combining the analysis of the near - horizon geometries",
    ", we shall elucidate the causal structures by illustrating carter - penrose diagrams . in section  [ sec : liftup ] the liftup and reduction scheme of the 5-dimensional solution is accounted for .",
    "it is shown that the 5-dimensional solutions derived in @xcite and in section  [ sec : bhs ] are elevated to describe the non - bps dynamically intersecting m2/m2/m2-branes in 11-dimensional supergravity . upon dimensional reduction the 4-dimensional black hole  @xcite is obtainable .",

    "the presence of an ergoregion implies the possibility of rotating energy removal process via the penrose process and the superradiant scattering  @xcite . we can find that this is indeed the case for @xmath141 as shown in appendix  [ sec : superradiance ] . for other values of @xmath136 ,",
    "the energy of a particle and a wave is not conserved , so it is not a straightforward issue to conclude whether such an energy extraction process is actually realizable under a dynamical setting .",
    "this is an interesting future work to be argued .",
    "we have also revealed that rotating solutions generically suffer from causal violation in the neighborhood of singularities .",
    "the pseudo - supersymmetry can not elude naked time machines .",
    "the reason is obvious : the ( pseudo-)supersymmetry variations  ( [ fakeks1 ] ) and ( [ fakeks2 ] ) are local , so that they make no direct mention of global structure of spacetime such as closed timelike curves . in particular ,",
    "the timelike singularity @xmath589 in the @xmath439 domain is repulsive .",
    "the original time - dependent equilibrium solution was derived via compactification of m2/m2/m5/m5-branes in 11-dimensional supergravity  @xcite .",
    "we discussed in section  [ m2m2m2 ] that the present metric with a single time - dependent harmonic function can be embedded into 11-dimensions , describing a dynamically intersecting m2/m2/m2-branes in a rotating kasner universe .",
    "it is shown that the 4-dimensional solution  @xcite was also derived from compactification of 5-dimensional solution on the gibbons - hawking space .",
    "unfortunately , such a liftup procedure fails to act as a chronology protector .",
    "it is of particular interest to see whether it oxidizes to a causally well - behaved solution in 10-dimensional supergravity , as in  @xcite .",
    "it appears appealing to examine if the occurrence of closed timelike curves corresponds to the loss of unitarity in the context of de sitter / cft correspondence .    _ note added .",
    "_ during the completion of this work , we noticed the work of  @xcite , which classifies all the pseudo - supersymmetric solution of the theory  ( [ 5daction ] ) .",
    "it is intriguing to examine if more general classes of solutions admit black hole horizons in the expanding universe .",
    "in the body of text , we considered several gauge fields in order to make the horizon area nonvanishing . to see this more concretely ,",
    "let us consider the 4-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity in which a single gauge field exists , @xmath590 where @xmath591 is a coupling constant .",
    "the bps equations are  @xcite @xmath592 ( remark that the second term in the dilatino equation  ( [ em_kseq2 ] ) has a factor 2-discrepancy with the result in  @xcite , which seems to be a typo . )",
    "this theory admits a static and spherically symmetric black - hole solution  @xcite , whose bps limit is given by @xmath593 where @xmath594 .",
    "this metric admits a killing spinor @xmath595}\\epsilon_\\infty $ ] , where @xmath596 denotes the constant spinor ( corresponding to the asymptotic value of @xmath55 ) satisfying @xmath597 .",
    "we find that any harmonic function @xmath598 on the flat 3-space solves the maxwell equations , hence this metric describes a multiple configuration , which is a cousin of a majumbdar - papapetrou solution",
    ".    this solution can be immersed in an flrw background by setting @xmath599 where @xmath600 is any harmonic function , and by introducing a liouville - type exponential potential @xmath601 this is a generalization of the solution given in  @xcite to any values of @xmath591 .",
    "this spacetime is dynamical and approaches to the flat flrw universe filling with the fluid of equation of state @xmath602\\rho $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , the metric fails to have a regular horizon in either case .",
    "these solutions exhibit timelike singularities at @xmath603 : the @xmath604 limit fails to give a throat geometry and the well - defined scaling limit does not exist either .",
    "this illustrates that only a single gauge field can not sustain a black hole .    finally , we briefly comment on the @xmath605 case , in which the theory can be oxidized to the 5-dimensional vacuum einstein gravity @xmath606 via the kaluza - klein lift  ( [ dd ] ) . when @xmath607 , the 5-dimensional metric admits a covariantly constant _ null _ killing vector @xmath65",
    ", hence the spacetime describes a pp - wave .",
    "this means that the bps solution  ( [ gmsol ] ) belongs to the null family of solution  ( see equation ( 4.42 ) of @xcite ) , so its time - dependent generalization @xmath608 does not give a black hole .",
    "we have found that the black holes preserving pseudo - supersymmetry ( [ sol_i])([sol_iv ] ) are rotating and possess ergoregion .",
    "hence we expect superradiance . for a spacetime which is asymptotically flrw universe , however ,",
    "it is difficult to argue the wave propagation since the background is dynamical : the particle energy with an asymptotic observer is not conserved . in order to discuss the superradiant phenomena without such an ambiguity",
    ", we shall address the wave propagation in the background the klemm - sabra solution  ( [ sol_iv ] ) [ the case ( iv ) ] , in which case the particle energy with respect to an observer rest at the cosmological horizon is conserved since we are able to introduce a stationary coordinate patch  ( [ kssol ] ) [ we shall restrict to the under - rotating case and drop the primes in the coordinates ( [ kssol ] ) ] .    since the stationary killing field for an observer rest at the cosmological horizon becomes spacelike inside the ergoregion , the energy measured by that observer can be negative .",
    "hence if a wave is scattered off by the black hole , this negative energy modes are excited and fallen into the black hole , allowing the outside observer to have an amplified wave coming out of the horizon .    for simplicity let us consider a massless scalar field @xmath609 , which evolves according to @xmath610 assuming @xmath611 the massless scalar field equation  ( [ psieq ] ) is separable .",
    "the angular equation is the spin - weighted spherical harmonics with spin weight @xmath612 .",
    "the angular function @xmath613 satisfies @xmath614\\theta = 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath615 incidentally , @xmath616 is proportional to the wigner d - function , an irreducible representation of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "note that the above angular equation does not involve @xmath69 , contrary to the kerr case .",
    "define the tortoise coordinate @xmath617 by @xmath618 so that @xmath619 as @xmath620 and @xmath621 as @xmath622 , where @xmath623 and @xmath624 denote respectively the loci of event and cosmological horizons with @xmath625 .",
    "it follows that the radial equation obeys the schdinger - type equation      it turns out that the reflected wave is amplified than the incident wave if the frequency lies in the superradiant regime @xmath627 such a superradiant amplification is characteristic to a rotating black hole with an ergoregion .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur for the supersymmetric black hole for which the stationary killing field is always timelike outside the horizon .",
    "this means that in the pseudo - supersymmetric case the energy measured by a local observer is not necessarily positive , which makes superradiance possible . for the black holes in the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , or even for those with arbitrary value of @xmath136 , we expect that the similar superradiant phenomena occur , although there exists a technical difficulty to define a particle state ( or the positive frequency states ) in a time - dependent spacetime",
