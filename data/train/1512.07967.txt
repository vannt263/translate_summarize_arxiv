    "atomic nucleus is one of the most fascinating quantum many - body systems that depicts a rich variety of shapes and structures . at the same time",
    ", it is also one of the most challenging problems in physics to investigate theoretically .",
    "the number of particles is not too large as in condensed matter physics so that statistical tools become applicable and also it is not too small such that few - body techniques can be employed for nuclei across the periodic table .",
    "the phenomenal progress in understanding the properties of nuclei has been achieved using phenomenological models and methods .",
    "these phenomenological models are primarily based on empirical observations and have played a pivotal role in unraveling the intrinsic structures of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the pioneering work of bohr , mottelson and rainwater laid the foundation of the phenomenological models in nuclear physics .",
    "it was demonstrated that properties of atomic nuclei can be elucidated by considering rotational , vibrational and single - particle motion as three basic degrees of freedom and led to the development of the collective model in sixties and seventies @xcite .",
    "this model is even being used today with the parameters determined through microscopic approaches rather than following the empirical route .",
    "the nuclear physics research is going through a renaissance with the state - of - the - art tools and techniques being developed to probe the wealth of nuclear properties .",
    "the availability of the leadership computing facilities has made it possible to apply _ ab - initio _ methods to lighter mass region with remarkable success .",
    "on the other hand , the density functional approach is now widely used to explore the ground - state properties all across the nuclear landscape @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "the progress achieved in applying these modern tools is quite remarkable and it is expected that it would be possible to apply these techniques to investigate a broad spectrum of nuclear properties all across the nuclear periodic table @xcite in a forseeable future . however , at the moment , these models have limitations and can not be employed to investigate , for instance , the rich - band structures observed in deformed nuclei .    in the absence of a fully microscopic theory , semi - microscopic models have been developed to study the properties of band structures in medium and heavy mass nuclei . in this class of models ,",
    "the triaxial projected shell model ( tpsm ) approach has been demonstrated to correlate the high - spin data of well deformed and transitional data with remarkable success @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide an overview of the recent applications of the tpsm approach to a wide range of nuclear properties @xcite .",
    "we also report new results on the observation of @xmath0 bands based on excited configurations .",
    "furthermore , we shall present a systematic investigation of @xmath2bands observed up to the highest spin in dysposium , hafnium , mercury and uranium isotopes .",
    "the manuscript is organised in the following manner . in the next section ,",
    "a few details of the tpsm approach are provided and some technical aspects of the model are included in the appendix . in section 3 , the results of the calculations for @xmath0- , chiral- and wobbling- bands are displayed and discussed .",
    "finally , the work presented in this manuscript is summarized and concluded in section 4 .",
    "the basic philosophy of the tpsm approach is similar to the spherical shell model model ( ssm ) with the only difference that deformed basis are employed for diagonalizing the shell model hamiltonian rather than the spherical one .",
    "the deformed basis are constructed by solving the triaxial nilsson potential with optimum quadrupole deformation parameters of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in principle , the deformed basis can be constructed with arbitrary deformation parameters , however , the basis are constructed with expected or known deformation parameters ( so called optimum ) for a given system under consideration . these deformation values lead to an accurate fermi surface and it is possible to choose a minimal subset of the basis states around the fermi surface for a realistic description of a given system .",
    "the nilsson basis states are then transformed to the quasiparticle space using the simple bardeen - cooper - schriefer ( bcs ) ansatz for treating the pairing interaction .    as the deformed basis",
    "are defined in the intrinsic frame of reference and do nt have well defined angular - momentum , in the second stage these basis are projected onto states with well defined angular - momentum using the angular - momentum projection technique @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional angular - momentum projection operator is given by @xmath5 with the rotation operator @xmath6 here , @xmath7 represents a set of euler angles ( @xmath8,\\ , \\beta= [ 0 , \\pi]$ ] ) and the @xmath9 are angular - momentum operators .",
    "the projected basis states considered in the present work for the even - even system are composed of vacuum , two - proton , two - neutron and two - proton plus two - neutron configurations , i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 in ( [ basis ] ) represents the triaxial qp vacuum state .",
    "the above basis space used for the even - even system is sufficient to study nuclei up to second band crossing region and in the rare - earth region this means approximately up to spin , i=24  @xmath12 . for odd - proton ( neutron ) systems ,",
    "the basis space is composed of one - quasiproton ( quasineutron ) and two - quasineutrons ( quasiprotons ) . in the case of odd - odd nuclei ,",
    "the basis space is simply one - quasiproton coupled to one- quasineutron .",
    "the advantage of the tpsm approach as compared to the other approaches , for instance the cranking approach , is that not only the yrast band but also the rich excited band structures can be investigated . as a matter of fact",
    ", the major focus of the present work is to study the @xmath0-bands which form the first excited band in many transitional nuclei .",
    "the nilsson triaxial quasiparticle states do nt have well defined projection along the symmetry axis , @xmath13 and are a superposition of these states .",
    "for instance , the triaxial self - conjugate vacuum state is a superposition of k = 0 , 2 , 4, ... states - only even - states are possible due to symmetry requirement @xcite .",
    "for the symmetry operator , @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 where , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 characterizes the intrinsic states . for the self - conjugate vacuum state @xmath18 and ,",
    "therefore , it follows from the above equation that only @xmath19 even , values are permitted for this state . for 2-qp states , the possible values for @xmath20-quantum number",
    "are both even and odd depending on the structure of the qp state . for the 2-qp state formed from the combination of the normal and the time - reversed states , @xmath21 and again",
    "only @xmath19 even values are permitted . for the combination of the two normal states , @xmath22 , and only @xmath19 odd states are allowed .",
    "the projected states for a given configuration that constitute a rotational band are obtained by specifying the corresponding k - value in the angular - momentum projection operator .",
    "the projected states from k = 0 , 2 and 4 correspond to ground- , @xmath2 and @xmath23bands , respectively . as stated earlier , for two - quasiparticle states ,",
    "both even- and odd - k values are permitted depending on the signature of the two quasiparticle states . in this description ,",
    "the aligning states that cross the ground - state band and lead to upbend or backbend phenomenon have k = 1 .",
    "the projection from the same quasiparticle intrinsic state with k = 3 is the @xmath0-band built on these two quasiparticle state .",
    "the @xmath0-bands built on the two - quasiparticle states shall form one of the major focal issues of the present work and shall be discussed in detail in the next section .    in the third and the final stage of the tpsm analysis ,",
    "the projected basis are employed to diagonalize the shell model hamiltonian .",
    "the model hamiltonian consists of pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole interaction terms , i.e. , @xmath24 in the above equation , @xmath25 is the spherical single - particle nilsson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the nilsson potential are fitted to a broad range of nuclear properties and is quite appropriate to employ it as a mean - field potential .",

    "( [ hamham ] ) is related to the quadrupole deformation @xmath3 as a result of the self - consistent hfb condition and the relation is given by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 mev , and the isospin - dependence factor @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31^{1\\over 3},\\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath32 @xmath33 for @xmath34 neutron ( proton ) .",
    "the harmonic oscillation parameter is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xmath37 . the monopole pairing strength @xmath38 ( in mev ) is of the standard form @xmath39 in the present calculation , we choose @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that the observed odd - even mass difference is reproduced in the mass region .",
    "the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 vary depending on the mass region and shall be mentioned in the discussion of the results .",
    "the above choice of @xmath38 is appropriate for the single - particle space employed in the model , where three major shells are used for each type of nucleon . the quadrupole pairing strength @xmath42 is considered to be proportional to @xmath38 and the proportionality constant being fixed as 0.18 .",
    "these interaction strengths are consistent with those used in our earlier studies @xcite .",

    "the chiral dynamical variable so called `` handedness '' ( @xmath44 ) is not a measurable quantity and what is measurable in the laboratory frame is the set of states of chiral doublet bands which have a well defined value of complementary variable , the chirality ( @xmath111 ) . in the strong chiral symmetry breaking limit with the three angular - momentun vectors perpendicular to each other",

    "the calculations reported here are preliminary and we are in the process of performing a detailed analysis of the wobbling motion for all the nuclei where it has been observed .",
    "during the last decade , research in nuclear theory has witnessed a discernable progress in the development of state - of - the - art models and techniques to elucidate the rich variety of shapes and structures in nuclei .",
    "there is a great optimism that in the coming years it should be possible to apply these _ ab - initio _ methods to investigate majority of the properties all across the nuclear periodic table with the availability of more powerful computing facilities .",
    "however , at the moment these methods have limited applicability and are used to describe nuclei in lighter mass regions only .",
    "to study , for instance , the rich band structures observed in medium and heavy mass regions , alternative methods with moderate computational requirements ought to be explored .",
    "recently , tpsm approach has been developed to describe the rich band structures observed in well deformed and transitional nuclei .",
    "this model employs the basis that are solutions of the triaxial nilsson potential and then three dimensional projection is performed to project out the states with well defined angular momentum quantum number .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that systematic studies of a large class of nuclei can be performed with a minimal computational effort . as a matter of fact , already a number of systematic investigations have been undertaken using this model and it has been demonstrated to reproduce the known experimental data remarkably well .",
    "this model has been applied to investigate a broad range of properties related to the triaxial degree of freedom of the nuclear deformation .",
    "it is known that most of the deformed nuclei are axially symmetric with well defined angular momentum projection along the symmetry axis so called the @xmath142 quantum number .",
    "band structures in well deformed nuclei are labelled with this quantum number and transitions in these nuclei are known to follow the selection rules based on this quantum number .",
    "however , there are also many regions so called transitional regions where the axial symmetry is known to be broken and a triaxial degree of freedom plays an important role .    in most of these triaxial nuclei , @xmath0-bands",
    "are observed which traditionally have been considered as vibrations in the non - axial degree of freedom . in the tpsm interpretation",
    ", @xmath0-bands emerge from the projection of the k = 2 component of the triaxial vacuum configuration .",
    "@xmath0-bands are known in some dy , hf , hg and u nuclei up to very high angular momentum and in the present work we have performed a systematic investigation of these nuclei using the tpsm approach .",
    "the observed yrast and @xmath0-bands in all these studied nuclei have been demonstrated to be well described by the tpsm calculations .",
    "deviations have also been noted above i = 22 and a possible reason for this discrepancy could be due to neglect of the four - quasineutron and proton configurations in the present work .",
    "the possibility of observing @xmath0-bands based on the quasiparticle configurations has also been explored in the present work .",
    "it is quite evident from the very construction of the basis states in tpsm approach that @xmath0-bands are possible based on each intrinsic state .",
    "@xmath0-band based on the ground - state are quite well established and have been studied using many different approaches and methods .",
    "however , @xmath0-bands built on the excited quasipartice configurations have remained rather abstruse as most of the earlier models did nt consider the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "it has been demonstrated that some of the excited band structures in ce- and nd- isotopes are , as a matter of fact , the @xmath0-bands based on two - quasiparticle states . in some of these isotopes , two s - bands are observed with similar g - factors and this has remained an unsolved problem for several years . in the conventional approach , two s - bands are expected to be based on neutron and proton aligned structures and , therefore , g - factors of the two s - bands should have opposite signs . measurements of g - factors of two s - bands provide same signs for both the s - bands and , thereby , indicating that both the s - band have either proton or neutron structures . what has been shown in the tpsm studies that second s - band in many of these nuclei",
    "is the @xmath0-band based on the two- quasineutron or proton states .",
    "as the parent band and the @xmath0-band based on it originate from the same intrinsic configurations , two s - bands in the tpsm approach are expected to have similar g - factors .",
    "tpsm has also povided an explanation on the observation of three s - bands in @xmath81ge .",
    "it has been shown that one of the s - band is the @xmath0-band based on the two - neutron quasiparticle state .",
    "further , recently new observations have been made in a set of nuclei that are considered as fingerprints of the triaxial deformation .",
    "these new observations include the occurrence of doublet bands and excited bands with dominant @xmath133 e2 transitions and have been regarded as manifestaions of chiral and wobbling motion in rotational nuclei .",
    "these observations are entirely as a consequence of the triaxial shape of system and are not possible in the axial limit . in the present work ,",
    "the appearance of the doublet bands have been investigated for odd - odd cs - isotopes from a = 124 to 132 and also for the odd - proton @xmath122rh and @xmath123rh isotopes .",
    "it is expected that the doublet band should be degenerate in the limit of strong chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it has been shown that the energy difference of the cs - isotopes for lighter isotopes is small and , therefore , may be regarded as originating from the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism . however , for heavier isotopes , the energy difference is large and also they have a considerable variation with spin and , therefore , the doublet bands can not be considered as chiral partners .",
    "we have also evaluated the differences in the be2 and m1 transitions and similar conclusions have been drawn from these quantities as from the energy considerations .",
    "the high - spin doublet band structures in @xmath122rh and @xmath123rh have also been proposed to originate from chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in the low - spin regime , these nuclei have regular @xmath0-bands and in the high - spin region , the observed energy difference between the @xmath0-band and the yrast sequence decrease with spin and based on this inference , the high spin band structures have been regarded as chiral partners .",
    "[ for the normal @xmath0-band , this difference remains almost constant ] .",
    "it has been shown that energy difference , both experimental and theoretical , is too large as compared to the cs - isotopes and for some angular momentum value it is more than @xmath143mev",
    ". it has been also demonstrated in our earlier study @xcite that quadrupole moment varies with spin quite appreciably and , therefore , the doublet bands in @xmath122rh and @xmath123rh can not be regarded as candidates for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we would like to add that one of the the major problem in the tpsm model is that first of all the pairing plus quadrupole interaction used is quite rudimentary and needs to be generalised for a better desciption of the nuclear properties .",
    "secondly , the coupling constants of the interaction are adjusted through self - consistency condition with the input deformation parameters .",
    "this means that optimum deformation value for a system under investigation should be known prior to performing the tpsm calculations .",
    "although , the final results should be independent of the input deformation in case a very large basis set is employed in the study , however , in practice a limited basis space is employed and the results become basis dependent . in order to circumvent this problem , we are considering to fix the coupling constant of the interaction through a mapping procedure as has been done in other approaches @xcite .",
    "the energy surface , for instance , obtained from the density functional theory can be mapped to the surface obtained using the model interaction used in the tpsm approach with adjustable coupling constants .",
    "there are several other possible ways of improving the predictive power of the tpsm calculations .",
    "for instance , the diagonalization of the shell model hamiltonian is performed for a fixed value of the deformation parameter and for a more accuate description , a set of deformation values should be considered by employing the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "this will allow the possibility to have coupling between the @xmath0-deformation and @xmath2vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the major discrepancy that has surfaced in the application of the tpsm approach is the band head energy of the @xmath96-band @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that for most of known cases , tpsm calculations underpredicts band head energy of this band by more than 1 mev .",
    "it is expected that @xmath96-band to have siginificant vibrational component because of mixing with the quasiparticle states which are close in energy .",
    "we hope that by performing gcm with both @xmath144 and @xmath0 as generator coordinates , the @xmath96-band and other properties shall be described more accurately .",
    "it is also quite important to include higher multi - quasiparticle states in the basis space .",
    "it has been noted in the present investigation that tpsm results tend to disagree above i = 22 and the reason for this discrepancy is the neglect of the four - proton and -neutron quasiparticle states .",
    "we are presently working to improve the tpsm approach along the lines discussed above and the results shall be presented in future publications .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian and transition operators in tpsm approach are evaluated using the wick theorem .",
    "for instance , for a two - body operator of the form @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the contraction and @xmath148 is the normal ordered form of the operator .",

    "<S> a systematic investigation of the nuclear observables related to the triaxial degree of freedom is presented using the multi - quasiparticle triaxial projected shell model ( tpsm ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> these properties correspond to the observation of @xmath0-bands , chiral doublet bands and the wobbling mode . in the tpsm approach , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-bands are built on each quasiparticle configuration and it is demonstrated that some observations in high - spin spectroscopy that have remained unresolved for quite some time could be explained by considering @xmath0-bands based on two - quasiparticle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in some ce- , nd- and ge - isotopes that the two observed aligned or s - bands originate from the same intrinsic configuration with one of them as the @xmath0-band based on a two - quasiparticle configuration . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed a detailed study of @xmath0-bands observed up to the highest spin in dysposium , hafnium , mercury and uranium isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , several measurements related to chiral symmetry breaking and wobbling motion have been reported recently . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena , which are possible only for triaxial nuclei , have been investigated using the tpsm approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that doublet bands observed in lighter odd - odd cs - isotopes can be considered as candidates for chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> transverse wobbling motion recently observed in @xmath1pr has also been investigated and it is shown that tpsm approach provides a reasonable description of the measured properties . </S>"
