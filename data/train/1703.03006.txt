    "active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback by radio jets is usually thought of as strongly negative , reducing the ability of the host galaxy to form stars by heating or injecting turbulence into the interstellar medium of the host galaxy ( e.g.  nesvadba et al .",
    "2007 , 2016 ; alatalo et al . 2015 ) or the surrounding intracluster medium ( e.g. brggen & kaiser 2002 ; ma et al . 2013 ) .",
    "negative feedback can also lead to expulsion of gas from the galaxy , though typically only a small fraction of gas exceeds the escape velocity ( e.g.  dasyra et al .",
    "nevertheless , there is a significant observational evidence of positive feedback through jet induced star formation , principally as an explanation of the `` alignment effect '' in high redshift , high luminosity radio - loud agn , where the radio and optical structures frequently appear co - aligned ( chambers , miley & van breugel 1990 , best , longair & rttgering 1996 , dey et al .",

    "jet induced star formation has also been suggested in several lower redshift objects , e.g.  mould et al .",

    "( 2009 ) in a companion to the `` hostless '' @xmath8 quasar he0450 - 2958 , as well as in minkowski s object , the subject of this paper .",
    "theoretical studies , initially driven by the discovery of the alignment effect , have also proposed jet induced star formation as an important mechanism for star formation in agn ( rees 1989 ; de young 1989 ) .",
    "wagner et al . (",
    "2016 ) suggest that powerful radio jets can provide both positive feedback ( via jet - induced star formation ) and negative feedback in their hosts .",
    "bieri et al .",
    "( 2015 ) make the case that jet - induced star formation could be responsible for the very high star formation rates seen in some high redshift galaxies .",

    "( 2016 ) and fragile et al .",
    "( 2017 ) suggest that jet induced star formation may produce characteristic ring morphologies in the young stellar population .",
    "most of these studies have concentrated on high power frii radio sources , and the existence and importance of these processes in the lower luminosity radio galaxies is unclear .",
    "fragile et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2017 ) modeled the jet - cloud interaction in minkowski s object , and were able to show that cooling in the post - shocked gas can be effective at forming molecular gas and stars .",
    "mukherjee et al . ( 2016 ) suggest that , because they spend longer confined in their host galaxies , lower power radio jets may have a greater effect on the ism than high power ones .",
    "this is important to establish , as low power radio galaxies are key to the `` radio '' or `` maintenance '' mode of negative feedback that is thought to be the dominant mechanism for the cutoff in star formation in the most massive galaxies ( croton et al .",
    "silk & nusser ( 2010 ) make the case that , paradoxically , jet induced star formation may actually enhance negative feedback effects , as the supernovae produced by triggered star formation may enhance the momentum in the outflow of gas from the nucleus .",
    "this provides a mechanism by which the relatively low power radio jets can couple effectively to the ism .",
    "thus proper understanding of the nature and role of jet induced star formation may be critical to our understanding of both negative and positive feedback .",
    "minkowski s object is a star forming dwarf galaxy in the poor cluster abell 194 , and a rare low redshift example of a radio jet interacting with a galaxy that is not its host .",
    "this allows us to make a detailed , spatially resolved study of the interaction .",
    "jet induced star formation has long been suggested as a possible mechanism for triggering the star formation ( brodie et al .",
    "1985 , van breugel et al .",
    "1985 ) , but the evidence remains circumstantial .",
    "to date , the definitive study of this object is that of croft et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter c06 ) , who use radio continuum , hi , ultraviolet , optical and near - infrared data to make a convincing case for triggering of star formation by the radio jet in this object .    the origin of minkowski s object remains unclear .",
    "the cluster is the host of two fri radio galaxies , one , hosted by ngc541 ( 3c40a ) , is the galaxy responsible for the jet impacting minkowski s object , but the other ( 3c40b ) , hosted by the nearby galaxy ngc547 ( itself one of a close pair of galaxies with ngc545 ) is of slightly higher radio luminosity ( sakelliou , hardcastle & jetha 2008 ) .",
    "these interactions , and the linear shape of abell 194 ( bliton et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggest that it is quite a young cluster , possibly in the process of virialization .",
    "there are thus two likely scenarios for the origin of minkowski s object , ( 1 ) it was a pre - existing dwarf galaxy in the cluster that happened to fall into the path of a radio jet , or ( 2 ) it formed in situ from a gas cloud between ngc545/547 and ngc541 , perhaps placed there as a result of tidal forces during the interaction ( deep optical images show a stellar bridge between ngc545/547 and ngc541 , along which minkowski s object is found ( c06 ) ) .",
    "if minkowski s object is a pre - existing dwarf , then , given the rarity of gas - rich dwarf galaxies near the centers of clusters is is probably on its first passage through the cluster ( e.g.  tran et al . 2005 ) .    the interstellar medium ( ism ) of minkowski s object was well studied in the atomic and ionized phases in c06 , however , the molecular gas that is the fuel for star formation has remained undetected prior to this study .",
    "the low metallicity and low molecular gas mass of minkowski s object has made it a challenge to detect in co ( though an attempt was made with the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30 m telescope by salom et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ) .",
    "we therefore requested time on the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) to obtain a detection of the co emission from minkowski s object , and obtained data in cycle 3 ( program 2015.1.00570.s ) . in this paper",
    "we describe the results of these observations , the first observational study in a series of new observations and numerical simulations ( fragile et al .",
    "2017 ) of minkowski s object that we expect to significantly enhance our understanding of the role of positive feedback in galaxy formation .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and a redshift of @xmath12 for minkowski s object , at which the luminosity distance is 82mpc and 1-arcsec corresponds to 381pc .",

    "minkowski s object was observed over four executions of a single scheduling block on 2016 january 2 and 2016 january 3 .",
    "the total time on source was 173 minutes .",
    "four spectral windows were observed with a bandwidth of 1875  mhz each , one centered on the expected velocity of the co(1 - 0 ) emission line at 113.15  ghz , and three ( centered at 99.2 , 101.1 and 111.2  ghz ) to provide continuum .",
    "observatory calibration was used , with uranus being observed as the flux density calibrator , this should result in flux densities accurate to @xmath14% .",

    "the calibrator for both observations was 3c48 .",
    "one iteration of self calibration in phase only was applied .",

    "then a more abrupt velocity jump to 5575  km  s@xmath15 in the vicinity of the northern clump c. figure  [ fig : mom1 ] shows that this velocity jump is also seen in the hi emission ( in fact more clearly than in the co emission ) , and the line along which it occurs is approximately aligned with the radio jet .",

    "second , the star formation rate surface density is higher and the gas depletion time shorter in the co clumps in the upstream direction of the radio jet ( clumps a and b ) where the jet has influenced the molecular gas for a longer period of time , than in the downstream clumps c and d. this is also consistent with the evidence we find for higher velocity dispersions in the molecular gas in clumps a and b. third , we also find marginal evidence for a flattening of the radio spectral index in the vicinity of the detected co clumps that is suggestive of cosmic ray electron re - acceleration in regions where the radio jet has driven shocks in the molecular gas .",
    "in addition , the hi images presented in this paper show a high velocity dispersion in the region of the hi cloud in the vicinity of the radio jet , consistent with jet - induced shocks , and both the hi and co emission show signs of a small ( @xmath3715  km  s@xmath15 ) , but abrupt change in velocity along the edge of the jet near co clump c ( see figure  [ fig : mom1 ] ) , that could be interpreted as further dynamical evidence for the presence of jet - disrupted atomic and molecular gas in minkowski s object .",
    "the timescales we measure are also consistent with jet - triggered star formation .",
    "the upstream regions have short gas depletion timescales @xmath116  yr , longer than the age of the starburst as estimated by c06 ( @xmath83  yr ) , and longer still than the cloud compression timescale from the simulations of fragile et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath117  yr .",
    "another important timescale is the time taken for minkowski s object to cross the path of the jet .",
    "the radial velocity difference between minkowski s object and ngc541 is about 250  km  s@xmath15 , at which speed minkowski s object would take @xmath118  yr to traverse the path of the jet .",
    "all of these timescales are shorter than the likely lifetime of the radio source of @xmath116  yr .",
    "these timescales are thus consistent with the scenario in which minkowski s object ( whether it formed from a gas cloud in situ , or originated from a dwarf galaxy infalling into the cluster ) experienced a burst of star formation as it crossed the path of the radio jet in an event that started @xmath83  yr ago , and has sufficient molecular gas to continue forming stars for the duration of the interaction .",
    "the ultimate fate of minkowski s object is an interesting question given our current understanding of agn feedback .",
    "although we find compelling evidence that minkowski s object is indeed an example of positive radio jet feedback , it is unlikely that the stars formed during the interaction will accrete onto ngc541 , the massive early - type galaxy hosting the radio agn responsible for the feedback . instead , we think it more likely that minkowski s object will remain bound and become a dwarf galaxy in the abell 194 cluster , or it will be dispersed due to supernova feedback and tidal effects , with its stars joining the intracluster stellar population ( e.g.  mihos et al .",
    "so the net effect of interactions like this may result in negative feedback on the host of the agn itself , by preventing further accretion of gas that could then cool and lead to increased star formation in the host . although cases like this are rare in the local universe , young clusters like abell 194 were much more common at @xmath119 , and therefore , when considered on cosmological timescales , both positive and negative radio agn feedback are likely to be important feedback mechanisms in regulating the growth and evolution of galaxies .",
    "this paper is part of a new series of papers on minkowski s object that will examine in detail the interaction between the radio jet and gas using both new numerical simulations ( fragile et al .",
    "2017 ) and new observations with the very large array and _ hubble space telescope_. with these new simulations and data we will further test the hypothesis of jet - induced star formation in minkowski s object , and study the detailed physics of the interaction .",
    "this paper makes use of the following alma data : ads / jao.alma#2015.1.00570.s .",
    "alma is a partnership of eso ( representing its member states ) , nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with nrc ( canada ) , nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) and kasi ( republic of korea ) in cooperation with the republic of chile .",
