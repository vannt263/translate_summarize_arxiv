    "quantum walks ( qws ) are considered as quantum counterparts of classical random walks .",
    "there are mainly two kinds of qws , that is , the discrete - time qw and continuous - time one@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the discrete one .",
    "it was mathematically shown that quantum search algorithms constructed by qws provide faster computations than the corresponding classical algorithms .",
    "as other applications , qws are ideal platforms to study energy transportation efficiency of photosynthesis@xcite , and the anderson localization in disordered systems@xcite , for instance . owing to the rich applications , it is of great importance to study the asymptotic behavior of qws , however , it would be difficult to implement the states in the long - time limit by experiment .",
    "moreover , because of its quantumness , it is difficult to understand qws intuitively",
    ". therefore , to understand the asymptotic behavior of qws , it is exceedingly important both to numerically simulate the time - step evolution of qws , and obtain limit theorems mathematically .",
    "+ so far , two kinds of limit theorems have described the characteristic properties of qws mathematically .",
    "the one is the limit theorem expressing localization .",
    "localization is one of the typical properties of discrete - time qws , which was first studied by inui _",
    "@xcite mathematically and numerically .",
    "the detailed definition of localization is devoted to @xcite for example .",
    "the other is the weak convergence theorem , which expresses ballistic spreadings of the walker by the weak limit measure , and is fully explained in @xcite , for instance .",
    "we should note that the weak limit measure is consisted by the dirac measure part corresponding to localization and absolutely continuous part , corresponding to the ballistic spreading .",
    "the weak convergence theorem for space - homogeneous qws in one dimension , such as hadamard walk@xcite , grover walk@xcite , was derived .",
    "+ nowadays , the research on the asymptotic behavior of space - inhomogeneous qws is one of the hottest topics in the filed of qws .",
    "here we review the previous studies of inhomogeneous qws briefly .",
    "@xcite gave the weak convergence theorem for a one - dimensional qws with one defect for the first time , taking advantage of the generating function of the weights of passages .",
    "@xcite studied the other types of one - dimensional qws with one defect , called the wojcik model , and showed analytically and numerically that the wojcik model exhibits astonishing localization effects for changing the phase of the defect .",
    "then , endo and konno@xcite proved the prominent localization effect mathematically , and in subsequent , they gave the weak convergence theorem for the wojcik model , which completed the whole description of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "_ @xcite got a stationary measure of the qw with one defect whose quantum coin is defined by the hadamard matrix at @xmath3 and the rotation matrix at @xmath4 .",
    "recently , endo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the two - phase qw with one defect which has two different time - evolution operators in positive and negative spatial regions , in addition to another operator at the origin .",
    "they derived the limit theorems concerning localization and the ballistic behavior , and they clarified the effect of the two different quantum coins and initial coin state of the walker on the asymptotic behavior .",
    "+ recently , localization appearing in the space - inhomogeneous qws has attracted attentions from a quite different direction , i.e. , topological invariants characterized by eigenvectors of the qw@xcite .",
    "this approach has emerged from recent developments on topological phases of matter in the condensed matter physics , known as topological insulators and superconductors@xcite .",
    "since the qw can be considered as the simplified theoretical model of topological insulators ( more preciously , floquet topological insulators@xcite ) , the topological phase of quantum walks has been intensively studied@xcite . in the field of theoretical physics on the topological insulators , a fundamental principle ,",
    "so - called the bulk - edge correspondence , predicts the existence of localized states at the interface where two adjacent spatial regions are characterized by different topological numbers .",
    "a recent work on the two - phase qw with one defect@xcite gives an opportunity to study localization of the space - inhomogeneous qw on the line in term of topological invariants .",
    "in the two - phase qw with one defect , however , there are three distinct spatial regions , i.e. , positive , negative spatial regions and the origin . on the topological phase of matter",
    ", the topological invariant is generally defined for a system with a finite spatial extent , roughly speaking , enough larger than the localization length of localized states .",
    "thereby , the single defect at the origin may prevent to apply the argument of topological invariants straightforwardly .",
    "+ in the present work , we study a complete two - phase qw which is defined by modifying the two - phase qw with one defect so that the coin operator at the origin is replaced with that in the positive space part .",
    "one of the important advantages to study the complete two - phase qw is that the model enables us to directly discuss the mathematically rigorous results on localization of the qw on the line in term of topological invariants .",
    "+ first , we derive mathematically rigorous results on the stationary , time - averaged limit , and weak limit measures of the complete two - phase qw . there have been constructed several kinds of popular techniques to mathematically investigate the asymptotic behaviors of qws , such as the fourier analysis@xcite , the cgmv method@xcite , the stationary phase method@xcite , the pass counting method@xcite , and the generating function methods@xcite .",
    "these methods are epoch - making , however , there are a lot of strict conditions . for example , we can only analyze space - homogeneous qws by the fourier analysis@xcite . motivated by the past studies , we take advantage of two kinds of the generating function methods@xcite .",
    "there is a possibility to analyze various kinds of space - inhomogeneous qws by the methods , however , it has not been clear the types of qws that can be analyzed by the generating function methods .",
    "we can also analyze inhomogeneous qws via the cgmv method , still the cgmv method allows only for the general discussion of localization properties for the typical qws with one defect on the line .",
    "one of the generating function methods offers not only the time - averaged limit theorem which describes localization , but also the weak convergence theorem for qws .",
    "the other generating function method provides the stationary measure which corresponds to the stationary distribution .",
    "it is the first application of the generating function methods for the analysis of inhomogeneous qw without defect .",
    "+ next , we study topological invariants of the complete two - phase qw . so far , coin operators whose matrix elements are real numbers are mostly employed to study the topological invariant of quantum walks , since these coin operators apparently satisfy necessary conditions required from relevant symmetries to establish a non - trivial topological invariant .",
    "however , we present that , by applying a proper unitary transform into the time - evolution operator , the coin operator with complex numbers of the complete two - phase qw can satisfy the condition .",
    "furthermore , we find that , since this unitary transform should be applied to the whole space of the complete two - phase qw , the bulk - edge correspondence predicting the localized states , is applicable when the phases of the two - phase qw satisfy a specific condition , nevertheless the time - averaged limit measure shows the presence of localized states unless the qw is homogeneous . + taking into account the mathematical rigorous results and the topological invariant of the complete two - phase",
    "qw , we argue the relation between the localization of the complete two - phase qw and the topological invariant with a help of the bulk - edge correspondence . we confirm that the bulk - edge correspondence agrees well with theorems for the stationary and the time - averaged limit measures .",
    "we also clarify the symmetry preserving perturbative coin operator for the complete two - phase qw .",
    "accordingly , we clarify the relation of localization of the two - phase qw with one defect and one of the complete two - phase qw .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelresult ] , we define the complete two - phase qw which is the main target in this paper , and present our mathematically rigorous results .",
    "the topological invariant of the corresponding time - evolution operator is studied in section [ topological - invariant ] .",
    "then , we present several examples to argue our results in section [ examples ] .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we first give the definition of the complete two - phase qw , and then present mathematically rigorous results on the stationary , the time - averaged limit , and the weak limit measures .      in this paper , we treat a two - state discrete - time qw in one dimension whose one - time step is defined by a unitary time - evolution operator @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is called _ the standard shift operator _ defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is called _ the coin operator _ expressed by    @xmath10    with @xmath11 . as a discrete - time qw , the walker has a coin state at position @xmath12 and time @xmath13 expressed by a two - dimensional vector :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the set of complex numbers , and @xmath16 is the set of integers .",
    "we should note that the walker steps to the left or right according to the recurrence formula @xmath17 where    @xmath18    with @xmath19 .",
    "we note that @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the left and right movements , respectively , and the walker steps differently in the spatial regions with the phase parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that is , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the qw does not have defect at the origin , which is in marked contrast to the two - phase qw with one defect@xcite .",
    "hereafter , we call the qw @xmath24-@xmath25 .",
    "putting @xmath26 , the model becomes the hadamard walk , which has already been intensively studied@xcite . at first",
    ", we derive limit theorems concerning localization for our qw , that is , the stationary and time - averaged limit measures .",
    "then , we show the weak convergence theorem describing the ballistic spreading in the distribution of the position in a re - scaled space , which contributes to mathematically express the whole description of the behavior of the walker in the long - time limit .",
    "we also show numerical results for some concrete phase parameters and initial states to see what our analytical results suggest , especially , to relate the complete two - phase qw to the topological phases in section [ examples ] .",
    "in this subsection , we present the first of our rigorous results , the stationary measure of the complete two - phase qw .",

    "we should note that @xmath52 strongly depends on @xmath53 , and by choosing appropriate @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 holds , which indicates that there is a possibility that we can investigate localization also by the stationary measure .",

    "in other words , the result indicates that the defect at the origin may contribute to the symmetric time - averaged distribution . here to clarify the relation between the stationary and time - averaged limit measures has been one of the mathematically basic interesting problems .",
    "in addition , our result suggests that if @xmath81 , then , the decay rate is positive valued , i.e. , @xmath82 , which indicates that localization may happen regardless of the phase parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and initial state .",

    "we provide with the proof of theorem [ weaklimit ] in appendix c by using the _ time - space generating function method_@xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the topological invariant of the complete two - phase qw .",
    "as we derived in the previous section , the time - averaged limit measure of the complete two - phase qw exhibits localization around the origin .",
    "recently , there has been a development to understand localization of qws as a localized surface state originating to the topological invariant which is inherited from the time - evolution operator@xcite . in order to relate the topological invariant to the localized states , we use a fundamental principle , called the _ bulk - edge correspondence_. this principle states that an absolute value of difference of topological numbers in two adjacent spatial regions gives a lower limit of the number of eigenvalues / eigenvectors exhibiting localization in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "it would be very interesting to directly compare the mathematically derived stationary and time - averaged limit measures with the prediction of the bulk - edge correspondence , which motivates us to derive the topological invariants of the complete two - phase qw .",
    "since each spatial region of the complete two - phase qw should be characterized by own topological number , we separately calculate the topological number on the regions with the phase @xmath83 or @xmath84 in the coin operator .",
    "first , we calculate the topological number for the region with the phase @xmath83 .",
    "put the coin operator for @xmath105 as @xmath106 we assume that the whole of line has the same coin @xmath107 , because the calculation of the topological number is simplified for a system with translation symmetry .",

    "we call these three symmetries _ relevant symmetries for topological phases_. while these symmetries give constraints on the hamiltonian , now we derive the corresponding constraints on the time - evolution operator of qws . the detail of the derivation is explained in appendix d. in order to make clear the relation to physics , we introduce quasi - energy @xmath110 , by the terminology in physics , which is defined from the eigenvalue @xmath111 of the time - evolution operator in eq.([2phase - eigenvalue.prob .",

    ". if so , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phs ] ) and ( [ eq : chiral ] ) guarantee that @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , a pair of quasi - energies with opposite signs @xmath123 around the symmetric point @xmath124 and/or @xmath125 appears .",
    "generally , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are set to be zero , however , let us consider arbitrary values , because the recent work on the topological phase of hadamard walks @xcite pointed out its importance .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to clarify symmetries of the time - evolution operator , we should redefine the time - evolution operator by shifting the origin of time to fit in the _ symmetry time frame_. for our qw , this corresponds to the situation that a half of the first coin operation is absorbed into the initial state .",
    "then , the redefined time - evolution operator for the one - time step is expressed as @xmath126 as explained in appendix e , by employing @xmath127 and setting proper symmetric point of quasi - energies , we identify the symmetry operators satisfying particle - hole and chiral symmetries in eqs .",

    "we note that , while @xmath132 @xmath133 is a more general expression of @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , we fix @xmath135 for simplicity .    while both chiral and particle - hole symmetries of the time - evolution operator can be identified , the values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phs op . ] ) and ( [ eq : chiral op . ] ) are different .",
    "this means that the time - evolution operator does not possess both chiral and particle - hole symmetries at the same symmetric point of quasi - energy .",
    "if two of the three relevant symmetries for topological phases are established , the other symmetry is automatically confirmed by combining the two identified symmetry operators . in our case , either chiral or particle - hole",
    "symmetries is established at a specific quasi - energy .",
    "thereby , time - reversal symmetry can not be retained .    for further arguments ,",
    "we need to choose the symmetric point of quasi - energy , that is , @xmath136 or @xmath137 .",
    "the proper symmetric point of quasi - energy to study topological invariant can be chosen from the distribution of the eigenvalue of @xmath138 , because the topological numbers can be well defined unless absolutely continuous spectra exist at the symmetric points of quasi - energy , i.e. , the quasi - energy gap should open by the terminology in physics . in appendix",
    "f , the eigenvalue problem of homogeneous @xmath138 is solved by the fourier analysis .",
    "we obtain the eigenvalue @xmath139}=i[\\cos\\{\\varepsilon(k)\\ } \\pm   i\\sin\\{\\varepsilon(k)\\ } ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cos[\\varepsilon(k ) ] = \\sin(k)/\\sqrt{2 } , \\label{eq : bulk spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the wave number .",
    "we see that the absolutely continuous spectra include quasi - energy @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , however , do not exist at @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "therefore , we focus on the time - evolution operator possessing chiral symmetry , where the topological numbers are well defined due to the presence of the quasi - energy gap . therefore , the time - evolution operator @xmath138 , we focus on hereafter in this section , possesses only chiral symmetry , and then belongs to the chiral unitary class ( class aiii in the cartan classification ) . in the table of the classification of topological phases@xcite",
    ", it is known that class aiii can possess @xmath145 topological phases in the one dimensional system .",
    "having identified that the system possesses chiral symmetry , topological invariants for the above time - evolution operator are given by calculating winding numbers@xcite . because of @xmath146 periodicity of quasi - energy , we remark that the qw with chiral or particle - hole symmetries possesses two symmetric points of the quasi - energy at @xmath137 as well as at @xmath147 .",
    "thus , we need to introduce two topological numbers . for the spatial region @xmath148 , topological numbers @xmath149 at quasi - energies @xmath150 @xmath151 are derived as @xmath152 the detail of the calculation is presented in appendix f.    topological invariants for the spatial region @xmath153 of the complete two - phase qw are obtained by applying eq.([eq : topological invariant + ] ) with a replacement @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",

    "the same @xmath134 in @xmath154 has to be applied for @xmath148 and @xmath153 .",
    "this restricts the phase @xmath84 so as to satisfy @xmath155 to maintain chiral symmetry . according to appendix f , topological numbers @xmath156 at quasi - energies @xmath150 for the spatial region with @xmath153",

    "when @xmath158 is odd , the two regions have different topological numbers whose difference is @xmath160 , and then , two localized eigenstates , one at @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) and the other at @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) , in the vicinity of the origin are predicted by the bulk - edge correspondence .    if @xmath158 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint sigma_- ] ) is not an integer , chiral symmetry of the two - phase qw is broken . in this case ,",
    "localized states at @xmath150 originating to the topological invariant are not expected from the bulk - edge correspondence . while this does not exclude a possibility having localized states at @xmath150 since the bulk - edge correspondence gives a lower bound of the number of edge states .",
    "however , most generally , quasi - energy of such localized states deviates from @xmath165 .",
    "one of the important properties of localized states originating to the topological invariant is robustness against perturbations satisfying the following conditions ;    1 .",
    "the perturbation should preserve the same relevant symmetries for topological phases with the non - perturbative time - evolution operator .",
    "the perturbation remains quasi - energy gaps open .    in case of one dimension",
    ", this robustness can be expressed more clearly such that the eigenvalue of the localized state remains unchanged and the eigenvector remains localized under the perturbations .",
    "therefore , this property can be utilized to verify whether localized states at @xmath150 originate to the topological invariant or not .",
    "now we consider the perturbations for the complete two - phase qw .",
    "we assume that only the coin operator introduces the perturbation .",
