    "transition - metal spinel compounds ab@xmath2x@xmath3 , where x is s or o , have been for many years the subject of intense experimental and theoretical activity .",
    "the b sublattice of the spinel structure forms corner - sharing tetrahedra , giving rise to a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice . in general , oxides and chalcogenides of transition metals exhibit complex charge- and spin - ordering that are often coupled with orbital - ordering .",
    "@xcite coupled orbital - charge - spin orderings have been investigated widely for compounds of the late transition metal ions with active @xmath4 orbitals within cubic geometry , such as the cuprates and manganites . in contrast , such orderings in spinel compounds are only beginning to be studied @xcite .",
    "spinel systems are considerably more complicated than the cuprates or manganites due to two distinct reasons .",
    "first , the b - ions in the spinels , which are in an octahedral environment of the x anions , often possess partially - filled @xmath0 @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "examples include v@xmath5 ions in the vanadates of zn @xcite , mn @xcite , and cd @xcite ; v@xmath6 in alv@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite ; ti@xmath5 in mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite ; ir@xmath9 in cuir@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite ; and rh@xmath9 in lirh@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the threefold degeneracy of the t@xmath10 orbitals , along with the weaker tendency to jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions @xcite in @xmath0-based systems lead to more complicated physics compared to @xmath4-based systems .",
    "second , the geometric frustration in the spinel structure , mentioned above , precludes simple orderings @xcite .",
    "very recently , an exotic orbitally - induced peierls instability has been proposed as the mechanism behind the metal - insulator transitions in the spinels like cuir@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "charge - segregation of ir into formally ir@xmath5 and ir@xmath11 , accompanied by the formation of an octamer of ir@xmath11 ions with alternate short and long bonds is observed in cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this unusual charge - ordering pattern has been explained within the context of an effective one - dimensionalization and peierls instability driven by orbital ordering ( oo ) .",
    "the spinel structure of cuir@xmath7s@xmath8 consists of criss - cross chains of ir - ions with strongest overlaps between orbitals of the same kind ( i.e. , @xmath12 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath13 ) . within the proposed mechanism ,",
    "oo in ir@xmath9 ions leads to completely filled degenerate @xmath14 and @xmath13 orbitals and effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) quarter - filled @xmath12 bands .",
    "the latter now undergoes a peierls instability that is accompanied by period 4 charge - ordering @xmath15 ir@xmath5/ir@xmath5/ir@xmath11/ir@xmath11 @xmath15 and long - intermediate - short - intermediate bonds , as seen experimentally@xcite .",
    "the oo and peierls instability are thought to be coupled , as opposed to independent .",
    "closely related phenomenologies have been proposed to explain the metal - insulators transitions in mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite and lirh@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while the proposed scenario @xcite does provide qualitative explanations , it raises many interesting questions .",
    "for example , the bond or charge periodicities that result from peierls distortion in real quasi-1d systems depend strongly on the bandfilling . naively then",
    ", one might be led to believe that unless the oo is complete and leads to integer occupations of the individual @xmath0 orbitals , exactly commensurate distortion periodicities , as supposedly observed in cuir@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite and mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite , are not expected .",
    "the exactly period 4 distortion in cuir@xmath7s@xmath8 and mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 is therefore a puzzle .",
    "secondly , the role of electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions , which can have important consequences on these transitions , is not clear .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the bond distortion in mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 causes nearest - neighbor ti@xmath5 pairs to form a spin - singlet state , giving a drop in the magnetic susceptibility at low temperature@xcite .",
    "furthermore , e - e interactions can strongly affect the distortion periodicities in 1d chains with fillings different from 1 electron per atom @xcite . addressing these issues",
    "requires explicit calculations based on hamiltonians containing all the necessary components , that to the best of our knowledge do not exist currently .",
    "we report here the results of explicit calculations based on a simplified model system that displays co - operative oo and peierls instability .",
    "our model system is a two - dimensional projection of the pyrochlore lattice , a checkerboard lattice with two degenerate directional orbitals per atom .",
    "as we discuss in the next section , the model captures the effective one - dimensionalization that occurs in the spinel lattice .",
    "there exist also subtle differences between the our model and the theoretical picture that has been employed for the spinels @xcite , that we discuss in section [ sect_discussion ] .",
    "we have considered two different electron densities , 1 electron per atom and @xmath16 electron per atom .",
    "we find that a stable peierls state with 1d order occurs for an electron density of 1 electron per atom .",
    "importantly , even for significant deviations of orbital occupancies from integer values , the peierls distortion is purely bond dimerization , as would be true in the precisely @xmath16-filled 1d band . we speculate that this is a consequence of interactions between the effective 1d chains of our model , which are not entirely independent . for the case of @xmath16 electron per atom we did not observe an orbitally - driven peierls state even for integer orbital occupancies in the absence of e - e interactions .",
    "for the same model in the limit of infinite e - e interactions , however , a stable bond dimerization occurs .",
    "this suggests the second main result of our paper , namely that e - e interactions are important in stabilizing orbitally - induced peierls states for the case of @xmath16-electron per atom within the orbitally degenerate checkerboard lattice .",
    "we will discuss possible implications of this result for the spinel lattice .",
    "the paper is divided in following subsections : in section [ sect_model ] we introduce our model hamiltonian ; in sections [ sect_1e ] and [ sect_12e ] we present numerical results for 1 and @xmath16 electron per atom respectively ; and in section [ sect_discussion ] we conclude and further discuss the relationship of our theory to spinels and related materials .",
    "as discussed above , no quantitative calculations exist of coexisting orbital and peierls order in spinel lattices .",
    "this is due to the huge complexity of these systems , which include three dimensionality , triply degenerate @xmath0 metal atom orbitals , possible jt distortions and frustration , in addition to e - e interactions .",
    "we therefore construct a simpler model based on a checkerboard lattice that is easier to handle , but that is expected to bear similarities with the spinel problem .",
    "note that although there exists a large body of literature on the consequences of frustration within the checkerboard lattice with a _",
    "single _ atomic orbital per site @xcite , we are unaware of similar calculations on the present model which deals with doubly degenerate orbitals at each site . an important property of orbitally - driven peierls order in these materials is that the oo leads to peierls order in _ several different crystal lattice directions _ @xcite . in order to incorporate orbital degeneracy , frustration , and the possibility of peierls order in multiple directions we consider the following hamiltonian for a checkerboard lattice with doubly degenerate metal orbitals at each lattice site . @xmath17    the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "we fix @xmath47 to the value 1 .",
    "as written in eq .",
    "[ ooham ] , the relative phase of the @xmath45 at each site is unrestricted . within the model of reference",
    "the effective one - dimensionalization is a consequence of oo alone and in principle will occur even in the absence of peierls distortion .",
    "we have used this to determine the preferred @xmath45 mode for both 1 and @xmath16 electron per site by calculating the orbital occupations in several large lattices with open boundary condition ( obc ) . in a large obc lattice ,",
    "the charge densities and bond orders far from the lattice edges spontaneously assume the pattern that would occur in the infinite lattice for 0@xmath48 coupling limit @xcite .",
    "an alternate approach to determine the dominant oo mode is to calculate in a periodic lattice the energies corresponding to each mode for fixed distortion amplitude ; the dominant mode is simply the one with the lowest total energy . in the present case",
    "we have performed both sets of calculations for both 1 and @xmath16 electron per site and have determined that the preferred oo mode in both cases is the `` checkerboard '' pattern of fig .",

    "while exact diagonalization has been used successfully for many 1d , quasi-1d , and two dimensional ( 2d ) lattices involving both e - e and e - p interactions , in the present model with two orbitals per metal site the hilbert space is too large to treat any meaningful size cluster within exact diagonalization .",
    "we will therefore consider first the non - interacting ( @xmath55 ) system , and then consider the effect of @xmath53 and @xmath56 within the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) approximation , with no assumption of the periodicity of the uhf wavefunction .",

    "we performed calculations for lattices up to 16@xmath3116 ( 256 atoms with 512 orbitals ) .",

    "whether or not a co - operative orbitally - induced peierls instability occurs for @xmath74 , as well as the periodicity of the resultant bond order wave are both important issues .",

    "the effects of @xmath53 and @xmath56 cancel exactly when @xmath79 .    from the hamiltonian ,",
    "the consequence of @xmath56 is to minimize the intrasite inter - orbital coulomb repulsion , which is achieved by orbital ordering .",
    "it is thus not surprising that @xmath56 has the same effect as @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ half - u ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath53 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ half - u ] , is however an artifact of the uhf approximation . in the case of the strictly 1d @xmath16-filled band chain with one orbital per site",
    ", exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo calculations have shown that the peierls bond - alternation is _ enhanced _ by the hubbard @xmath53 @xcite . in contrast , the uhf approximation predicts incorrectly that @xmath53 destroys the bond alternation in the above case @xcite .",
    "had we been able to perform exact diagonalization in the present case , we would have found similar enhancement of the bond dimerization by @xmath53 .",
    "this would have had a profound effect on our overall result , reducing significantly the @xmath77 or the threshold @xmath78 at which the bond dimerization appears .",
    "the most important conclusion that follows from the above is that an orbitally - induced peierls instability can occur even for incomplete oo ( @xmath80 ) , and as long as the instability occurs at all , the bond order wave is period 2 for @xmath76 significantly less than 1 .",
    "indeed , it is conceivable that the threshold value of @xmath78 at which the bond dimerization appears can be even smaller than 0.8 for nonzero e - e interactions .",
    "we have found no other periodicity or evidence for soliton formation in our calculations .",
    "an interesting aspect of the oo driven bond distortion here is the phase relationship between the bond order wave states involving the @xmath14 and @xmath13 orbitals in fig .",
    "[ dist-1e ] .",
    "the short bonds along the @xmath27 and @xmath28-directions occupy the same plaquettes , yielding a structure that is reminiscent of ( but different from ) the valence bond crystal obtained within the heisenberg spin - hamiltonian for the checkerboard lattice @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "the bond dimerizations along any one direction but on different diagonals of the checkerboard lattice are strictly `` in - phase '' .",
    "both of these indicate that while the bond dimerizations are consequences of effective one - dimensionalization , there exist strong 2d interactions in between both the criss - cross and parallel chains .",
    "we ascribe the persistence of the bond dimerization for @xmath74 to the commensurability effect arising from the 2d interactions .      in cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 and mgti@xmath7o@xmath8 , the distortion along the chain directions is not bond dimerization but a period 4 distortion @xcite .",
    "this is as expected for a peierls transition in a 1d chain with carrier density 0.5 .",
    "we have therefore performed self - consistent calculations within our model hamiltonian also for density 0.5 .",
    "not surprisingly , we do obtain self - consistently an orbitally ordered state here for nonzero @xmath46 with @xmath81 . even within an essentially 100% orbitally - ordered state ( minority orbital charge density @xmath82 0.01 ) ,",
    "however , and with very strong @xmath61 , we were unable to obtain a stable peierls - distorted state . in all cases our self - consistent simulations converged to states with disordered bond distortions and charge densities , indicating vanishing bond - charge distortion in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we obtained similar results after including @xmath53 and/or @xmath56 within the uhf approximation .",
    "we conclude that for electron density away from 1 electron per atom , orbitally - driven peierls ordering does not occur within our model in the non - interacting limit or within the mean - field approach to e - e interactions .",
    "we ascribe the absence of bond - charge distortion here to the important role played by the interaction among the crisscrossing chains within the checkerboard lattice .",
    "we have already pointed out in section [ sect_results]a that the stabilization of the perfect period 2 distortion for the case of 1 electron per atom , even in the absence of complete oo , is a signature of such a 2d interaction .",
    "similar 2d interactions should be relevant also for carrier density 0.5 . since within mean field theory the peierls instability in 2d is limited to carrier density of 1 , the absence of the bond - charge distortion in the present case is to be anticipated . on the other hand , we have recently shown in a series of papers that specifically for this carrier density and one orbital per site , nonzero e - e interactions can strongly stabilize bond - charge ordered states in 2d lattices @xcite . in the case of the checkerboard lattice with a single orbital per site , plaquette spin - singlet formation ( though without charge - ordering ) has similarly been found for the same carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that similar effects of e - e interactions persist in the present case with two degenerate orbitals per site .",
    "unfortunately , performing a realistic calculation with finite @xmath53 that goes beyond the uhf approximation in the present case is beyond our computational capability .",
    "we have therefore investigated our model hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ spinelham ] in the limit of @xmath83 , where we assume band orbital occupancy corresponding to that for spinless fermions . fig .",

    ", bond dimerization occurs along the diagonal directions , and oo and bond distortion reinforce each other cooperatively .",
    "in summary , we have carried out numerical studies on the 2d checkerboard lattice with two degenerate directional orbitals per site - a model system that like the spinel compounds can in principle exhibit oo - driven peierls bond distortions and charge ordering in multiple directions .",
    "in addition to oo and bond modulation terms , our model hamiltonian includes both intra- and inter - orbital e - e correlations that were treated within the uhf approximation .",
    "although some of our results have strong implications for the spinels , it is useful to precisely understand the differences between the spinel and checkerboard lattices such that the applicability as well as limitations of our model can both be understood .",
    "one difference between the two lattices is that the plaquettes in the 2d checkerboard lattice do not correspond to the tetrahedra in the spinel lattice because of the difference between horizontal and vertical bonds in fig .",
    "[ lattice](a ) on the one hand and the diagonal bonds on the other @xcite .",
    "what is more important in the present context is that the oo in our model is not driven by a band jt transition that destroys the degeneracies of the atomic orbitals in the model of . within our model",
    "the two orbitals of different symmetries on a given atom are both potentially active orbitals .",
    "we believe that our demonstration of the co - operative interaction between oo and the peierls instability in section [ sect_1e ] , where each broken symmetry enhances the other , is of direct relevance to the @xmath0-based spinel systems , where qualitative discussions have suggested similar results @xcite .",
    "similarly , our observation that the period 2 bond distortion persists for 1 electron per atomic site even for incomplete oo , with majority charge density as low as 0.8 per orbital , may also be of significance for the spinels .",
    "this should be particularly true for nonzero onsite hubbard interaction , which will tend to decrease the amplitude of the oo .",
    "complete oo in the real systems cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 and mgti@xmath2o@xmath3 requires that the energy gap due to the jt distortion is significantly larger than the hubbard interaction .",
    "it is at least equally likely that the commensurate charge and bond distortions found in the experimental systems are not due to complete oo but are consequences of the complex interactions between the crisscrossing chains in the spinel lattice , as in the checkerboard lattice .",
    "the implication of the absence of the peierls instability for the case of @xmath16 an electron per atom in the checkerboard lattice within one - electron theory is less clear .",
    "one possible implication is that our results for the 2d checkerboard lattice are irrelevant for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) spinel lattice because of the fundamental difference between them that has already been pointed out in the above . in cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 , the only active orbital following the oo is the @xmath12 orbital @xcite , which has been excluded within our model .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the 1d character of the active orbitals in cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 following oo is much stronger than in the checkerboard lattice , and this is what drives the metal - insulator transition in the real system .",
    "it is , however , equally likely that the 3d interactions between the @xmath12-based chains are as strong as the 2d interactions in the checkerboard lattice ( recall , for example , that commensurate periodicity for independent 1d chains requires complete oo , see above ) . in this case",
    "our null result for the uncorrelated checkerboard lattice would imply non - negligible contribution of e - e interaction to the metal - insulator transitions in cuir@xmath2s@xmath3 and lirh@xmath2o@xmath3 . further theoretical work based on the 3d pyrochlore lattice as well as experimental work that determines the extent of oo in the real systems will both be necessary to completely clarify this issue .    finally , assuming that e - e interactions play a role , which is subject to further investigations as discussed above , this raises an interesting question , viz .",

    "three of us have argued elsewhere that for carrier concentration precisely 0.5 , there is a strong tendency to form a paired - electron crystal ( pec ) , in which there occur pairs of spin - singlet bonded sites separated by pairs of vacancies @xcite .",
    "this tendency to spin pairing is driven by nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations ( as would exist in a large hubbard - u system ) and is enhanced in the presence of lattice frustration .",

    "<S> it has been suggested that the metal - insulator transitions in a number of spinel materials with partially - filled @xmath0 @xmath1-orbitals can be explained as orbitally - driven peierls instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these suggestions , we examine theoretically the possibility of formation of such orbitally - driven states within a simplified theoretical model , a two - dimensional checkerboard lattice with two directional metal orbitals per atomic site . </S>",
    "<S> we include orbital ordering and inter - atom electron - phonon interactions self - consistently within a semi - classical approximation , and onsite intra- and inter - orbital electron - electron interactions at the hartree - fock level . </S>",
    "<S> we find a stable , orbitally - induced peierls bond - dimerized state for carrier concentration of one electron per atom . </S>",
    "<S> the peierls bond distortion pattern continues to be period 2 bond - dimerization even when the charge density in the orbitals forming the one - dimensional band is significantly smaller than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for carrier density of half an electron per atom the peierls instability is absent within one - electron theory as well as mean - field theory of electron - electron interactions , even for nearly complete orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results in relation to complex charge , bond , and orbital - ordering found in spinels . </S>"
