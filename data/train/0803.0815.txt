    "glueballs are important in the understanding of several mechanisms .",
    "some authors proposed that glueballs characterize de - confinement @xcite and that their coupling to proton affects the gluonic contribution to proton spin @xcite .",
    "an important difficulty is that glueball states might possibly mix strongly with nearby meson states @xcite .",

    "@xcite , two sets of parameters , denoted a and b , were presented for the model iii ( see table  [ tab : par ] ) . with the set a , it is possible to obtain glueball masses in agreement with the results of some experimental works @xcite : the lowest @xmath5 state near 2  gev , the lowest @xmath6 state near 1.5  gev , and the lowest @xmath7 state near 2.1  gev .",

    "@xcite , the two sets will also be considered . nevertheless , in the following",
    ", we mainly focus our attention to the results obtained with the set b.    it is worth mentioning how the parameters have been determined in ref .",
    "the mass of the lightest @xmath5 is nearly independent of the values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , but depends strongly on @xmath2 .",
    "so , this last parameter has been determined with this @xmath5 state .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 have then be computed in order to reproduce the lightest @xmath6 and @xmath7 states .",
    "the three states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 have been chosen because they are possible experimental glueball candidates @xcite and because they are computed with relatively small errors in lattice calculations @xcite .      a good approximation of the confining interaction between a quark and an antiquark in a meson is given by the linear potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance between the two particles and where @xmath2 is the string tension . in a baryon ,",
    "lattice calculations and some theoretical considerations indicate that each quark generates a flux tube and that these flux tubes meet in a junction point @xmath10 which minimizes the potential energy ( the so - called y - junction ) . following this hypothesis ,",
    "the confinement in a baryon could be simulated by the three - body interaction @xmath11 for such a potential , the point @xmath10 minimizes also the length of the three flux tubes and is identified with the toricelli point @xcite .    the energy density @xmath12 of a flux tube ( string tension ) can depend on the color charge @xmath13 which generates it .",
    "lattice calculations @xcite and effective models of qcd @xcite predict that the casimir scaling hypothesis is well verified in qcd , that is to say that the energy density is proportional to the value of the quadratic casimir operator @xmath14 of the colour source @xmath15 we have then @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we will assume that the confinement in a three - body color singlet is given by @xmath18 this potential can be considered as the three - body generalization of the confinement used in ref .",
    "no constant potential is added , contrary to usual hamiltonians in mesons and baryons @xcite .",
    "let us note that if the three color charges are not the same , @xmath10 is no longer identified with the toricelli point @xcite .",
    "interaction  ( [ vyccc ] ) is very difficult to use in a practical calculation .",
    "a good approximation can be obtained for three identical color charges by substituting @xmath10 by the center of mass coordinate @xmath19 and by renormalizing the potential by a factor @xmath20 which depends on the three - body system @xcite . for three identical particles ,",
    "the best value is @xmath21 .",
    "we will use this approximation in the following , which seems more realistic than a confinement obtained by the sum of two - body forces @xcite .",
    "we include in our model the spin - orbit correction to the confinement potential .",
    "it is given by the thomas precession of the particles and reads @xcite @xmath22 this second order correction depends on the effective gluon mass @xmath23 .",

    "let us note that a y - junction for the confinement leads to a three - body spin - orbit since the torricelli point is function of the three particles .",
    "but with our approximation relying on the center - of - mass , the thomas precession term is a sum of three one - body spin - orbit interactions .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the confinement potential saturates at large distances in order to simulate the breaking of the color flux tube between gluons due to color screening effects .",
    "an interaction of type  ( [ vyccc ] ) seems a priori inappropriate since the potential energy can grow without limit .",
    "but the phenomenon of flux tube breaking must only contribute to the masses of the highest glueball states .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the introduction of a saturation could not be the best procedure to simulate the breaking of a string joining two colored objects @xcite .      within the auxiliary field formalism (",
    "also called einbein field formalism ) @xcite , which can be considered as an approximate way to handle semirelativistic hamiltonians @xcite , the effective qcd hamiltonian has a kinetic part depending on the particle * current * masses @xmath24 and the interaction is dominated by the confinement .",
    "a * state - dependent constituent * mass @xmath25 can be defined for each particle , and all relativistic corrections ( spin , momentum ,  ) to the static potentials are then expanded in powers of @xmath26 .",
    "this approach has been used in ref .",

    "@xcite , it has been shown that it is an important ingredient to obtain correct two - gluon glueball spectra .    using the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to obtain an analytical approximate formula giving the glueball mass @xmath30 and the constituent gluon mass @xmath31 ( the three constituent gluon masses are the same since the wave function is completely symmetrized , see sec .  [",
    "sec : wf ] ) @xmath32 @xmath33 is the excitation number . with a value of the meson string tension @xmath34 around 0.2  gev@xmath35 ,",
    "the smallest gluon constituent mass is around 650  mev .",
    "it is then relevant to use an expansion in powers of @xmath36 .",
    "such a value of the gluon mass is in agreement with the values used in refs .",
    "@xcite , but here the constituent mass is dynamically generated .    instead of using the auxiliary field formalism , it is possible to consider relativistic corrections which are expanded in powers of @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( see for instance ref .",
    "but , this leads to very complicated non local potentials which are difficult to handle .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath39  ( [ h0_3 g ] ) gives the main features of the three - gluon glueball spectra , but the introduction of a short - range potential is necessary to achieve a detailed study . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a one - gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction between two gluons , coming from ref .",
    "@xcite , has been considered .",
    "it is not possible to use it directly for a three - gluon glueball because the color structure of the interaction is different .",
    "so , we use here the last version of a oge interaction between two gluons developed specifically for three - gluon glueballs @xcite .",
    "its explicit form , which is very similar to the form of the oge interaction for two - gluon glueballs , is given below .",
    "this interaction contains a tensor part and a spin - orbit part . in our previous study of the low - lying spectrum @xcite , we neglected these terms since we worked on @xmath40 states .",
    "it has been shown that the tensor interaction between two gluons is small in two - gluon glueballs @xcite .",
    "hence , we only add a two - body spin - orbit interaction between each pair of gluons .",
    "the oge two - gluon potential has a priori a very serious flaw : depending on the spin state , the short - range singular part of the potential may be attractive and lead to a hamiltonian unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "this problem is solved , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by giving a finite size to the gluon ( see sec .  [",
    "ssec : size ] ) .",
    "the oge potential depends on the gluon constituent mass . to determine it ,",
    "we follow the procedure proposed in ref .  @xcite . for a given set of quantum numbers @xmath41 ,",
    "the eigenstate @xmath42 of the hamiltonian @xmath39 is computed . with this state , a constituent gluon mass",
    "is computed @xmath43 .",
    "this value of @xmath44 is then used in the complete hamiltonian ( see sec .  [",
    "ssec : ht ] ) to compute its eigenstate with quantum numbers @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noting that , with this procedure , two states which differ only by the radial quantum number are not orthogonal since they are eigenstates of two different hamiltonians which differ by the value of @xmath23 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this problem is not serious , the overlap of these states being generally weak .      in potential models , the gluon is considered as an effective degree of freedom with a constituent mass . within this framework ,",
    "it is natural to assume that a gluon is not a pure pointlike particle but an object dressed by a gluon and quark - antiquark pair cloud .",
    "such an hypothesis for quarks leads to very good results in meson @xcite and baryon @xcite sectors . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume here a yukawa color charge density for the gluon @xmath45 where @xmath3 is the gluon size parameter .",
    "the interactions between gluons are then modified by this density , a bare potential being transformed into a dressed one .    the main purpose of the gluon dressing is to remove all singularities in the short - range part of the interaction @xcite .",
    "but , for consistency , the same regularization is applied to the confinement potential , although no singularity is present in this case .",
    "we think that the definition of a gluon size , which has a clear physical meaning , is preferable to the use of a smearing function only for potentials with singularity @xcite .    a one - body potential , like @xmath46 , is dressed by a simple convolution over the density of the interacting gluon and the potential @xmath47 a dressed two - body potential , depending on @xmath48 ,",
    "is obtained by a double convolution .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to the following calculation @xcite @xmath49 note that for the spatial dependencies of the spin - orbit interactions , which depend on the derivative of the first order potentials , the convolution must be performed before taking the derivative .    for non vanishing value of @xmath3 , the value of the confinement potential at origin increases .",
    "this shifts the whole spectra to higher masses .",
    "moreover , the strength of the coulomb interaction is reduced .",

    "it is unavoidable in our model , since a spin 2 function has a mixed symmetry which implies a mixed symmetry for the space function and then a greater mass for the corresponding glueball , in agreement with the results of refs .",
    "it has been checked that the spatial wave function of the @xmath61 state is dominated by a configuration in which each internal variable is characterized by one unit of angular momentum .",

    ", the @xmath84-basis leads to more states that the ones predicted by the lattice and also to @xmath85 states forbidden by yang s theorem .",
    "a solution to cancel the extra states is to deal with the so - called helicity formalism @xcite .",

    "the @xmath89 three - gluon glueball are also in quite good agreement with these lattice results , except for the @xmath61 state which is computed with a very high mass in our model . in this work , the @xmath67 and some @xmath0 three - gluon glueballs are finally computed .",
    "the @xmath68 candidates with @xmath86 odd for the odderon trajectory are in agreement with some other works .",
    "but , if the @xmath77 and @xmath79 states are predicted in quite good agreement with lattices results , it is not the case for the @xmath78 and @xmath80 states computed with too high masses in our model .",
    "one could interpret such a discrepancy as due to the fact that the spin - orbit forces are too feeble in our model to raise the degeneracy between @xmath0 states .",
    "but we do not believe that a physical process , ignored here , is able to produce a strong enough spin - orbit force giving rise to more than 1  gev energy gap .",
    "we think that the strong discrepancies between our results and lattice computations are due to the fact that gluons do have constituent non vanishing masses in our approach .",
    "they are then characterized by a spin , and not by a helicity as it could be expected for particles with a vanishing current mass .",
    "we have shown that working with the helicity formalism could cure the problem of extra states in two - gluon glueballs @xcite .",
    "we think that this formalism applied to three - gluon glueballs could also improve the predictions of a potential model .",
    "such a work is in progress .",
