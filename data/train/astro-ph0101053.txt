    "present search for explanation of the observed ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( crs ) resembles somewhat a random walk among possible and impossible particle acceleration models and wide range of more or less exotic physical concepts and particles .",
    "the expanding space of such studies is described by more and more numerous review papers appearing in astro - ph listings .",
    "the present one is limited to discussing some astrophysical mechanisms proposed to accelerate cosmic rays up to the highest observed energies . in our opinion necessity to seriously consider sources involving ` strange ' particles or new physics will come after astrophysical models applying the classical physics are rejected by observations .",
    "a review of uhe cr observations is presented by e.g. bertou et al . [ 5 ] .",
    "the factors limiting energies of particles accelerated in astrophysical sources include an acceleration rate and a loss rate due to synchrotron radiation and ic or inelastic scattering . however , for the highest considered energies quite often an upper energy limit is provided by a finite source extent . to evaluate the role of this last factor one needs information about magnetic fields present within its volumes .",
    "for objects with relatively strong magnetic fields such data are quite often firmly constrained by radio and high energy observations .",
    "contrary to that , knowledge of weak magnetic fields in extragalactic space or in galactic coronae , important for the discussed below models involving supergalactic accretion shocks or local sources concentrated toward the galaxy centre , is only fragmentary .",
    "therefore , let us start with a short review of the new evidence on such magnetic fields , which could also substantially influence transport of @xmath2 ev particles reaching earth .",
    "next , we will discuss a few astrophysical ` bottom - up ' models for generation of such particles .",
    "_ our intention is not to discuss the full literature of the subject , but rather to overview a set of characteristic publications presenting the discussed models . _    below , in most cases",
    "we use a term ` particle ' for protons .",
    "the importance of any considered magnetized structure for particle acceleration can be evaluated by comparing its size to the particle gyroradius for a quantity @xmath3 divided by @xmath4 of the respective units , e.g. for energy @xmath5 ev , for the magnetic field @xmath6 g , or for a distance @xmath7 cm . ]",
    "@xmath8    where @xmath9 is a given nucleus charge state .",
    "early evaluations of the field strength at _ largest scales _ yielded usually upper limits only of the magnitude order @xmath10  g. the direct observations of extended extragalactic synchrotron glows started in 1990 , and were continued in last few years , revealing much stronger fields within galaxy clusters and even in the intracluster space ( for review see kronberg [ 13 ] ) .",
    "estimates show , that @xmath11 may reach @xmath12 @xmath13 g in rich clusters and approximately @xmath14 @xmath13 g in supergalactic accretion flows and in supergalactic structures at several mpc scales . turning to smaller scales",
    "a series of spiral galaxy observations proves existence of extended  with the vertical scale @xmath15 several kpc ",
    "magnetic coronae near some ( not all ) galaxies with a few @xmath13 g magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "beck [ 2 ] ) .",
    "even irregular galaxies show well organized magnetic field structures ( chyy et al . [ 8 ] ) .",
    "growing evidence supporting the kronberg s claim , that magnetic fields appear to be all - pervasive in space , weaken the opinion that the uhe cosmic ray showers directions point approximately to sources of the observed particles ( cf .",
    "sigl et al .",
    ". however , there exists also a growing number of observed particle pairs and triplets above a few times @xmath16 ev which could suggest the opposite ( cf .",
    "uchihori et al .",
    "relativistic jets occurring in frii radio galaxies carry large energy up to the radio ` hot spots ' situated far ( @xmath17 kpc ) from the central source .",
    "these hot spots are believed to harbor strong , mildly relativistic shocks dissipating the jet bulk kinetic energy into heating plasma , generating magnetic fields and efficiently accelerating energetic particles . because of relatively slow radiative losses for protons such shocks are prospectus uhe cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "additionally , an active role in accelerating uhe cosmic rays can play a velocity shear layer at the relativistic jet side boundary .",
    "let us discuss these possibilities in some detail .",
    "a full elaborated model of uhe crs acceleration at the relativistic jet terminal shock was presented by , e.g. , rachen & biermann [ 17 ] .",
    "they considered a shock wave with parameters derived from observations of hot spots in the considered sources .",
    "one can model the downstream region of the shock to be a circular slice of compressed plasma with the radius in the range @xmath18 kpc , thickness @xmath19 kpc , the magnetic field @xmath20 mg .",
    "the evaluated jet velocities are in the mildly - relativistic range @xmath21 c. in order to derive the upper limit for the accelerated proton energy , @xmath22 , we compare the shock acceleration time scale given by rachen & biermann for a parallel ` @xmath23 ' shock    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean magnetic field , with the loss time scale scaled to that of the synchrotron radiation    @xmath26    where @xmath27 ( @xmath28s for @xmath11 given in mg ) is a constant , @xmath3 represents ( in some conditions a large , varying with the local conditions and particle energy ) correction to @xmath29 due to inverse - compton ( ` ic ' ) and inelastic collisions , and @xmath30 is a proton lorentz factor .",
    "near the shock , rachen & biermann [ 17 ] considered the non - linear kolmogorov turbulence extended up to the scales comparable to the hot spot size .",
    "thus , in the long wave range important for the highest energy particle scattering the diffusion was the bohm diffusion , @xmath31 , leading to the most rapid acceleration .",
    "then , for ` typical ' hot - spot parameters @xmath32 mg , @xmath33 c , @xmath34 kpc , @xmath35 , the conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be satisfied up to energies of a few @xmath0 ev",
    ".    however , some of the above assumptions or evaluations are only rough estimates , which make the derived @xmath22 somewhat uncertain .",
    "for example a required diffusive size for @xmath38 ev particles seems to be at least ( and in fact more than ) @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "drury [ 9 ] ) , otherwise the particle spectrum exhibits a cut - off ( see also below ) .",
    "also , the turbulence structure downstream of the shock can substantially deviate from the assumed kolmogorov form .",
    "ostrowski ( [ 14 , 15 ] ) discussed the process of particle acceleration up to ultra high energies at tangential velocity transitions at side boundaries of relativistic jets .",
    "an uhe particle can cross such boundary to inside or to outside the jet , then be scattered back to cross the jet boundary again .",
    "if the process repeats , each boundary crossing increases particle energy by , on average ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the jet lorentz factor and the efficiency factor @xmath42 depends on particle anisotropy at the boundary and , thus , on the character of mhd turbulence responsible for particle scattering . for highly turbulent conditions @xmath42 can be a substantial fraction of unity , decreasing like @xmath43 for larger @xmath41 . as a result",
    "high energy particles near the jet boundary can be accelerated forming a power - law spectrum up to some cut - off energy , @xmath44 , appearing when the respective particle gyroradius @xmath45 becomes comparable to the jet radius , @xmath46 .",
    "the performed simulations show that @xmath22 obtained in the boundary acceleration process is comparable to the discussed above maximum particle energy obtained at the terminal shock .",
    "it grows with increasing @xmath47 , but always @xmath48 : in the simulations for mildly relativistic jets usually @xmath49 .",
    "an additional interesting feature of this acceleration process is the fact , that particles _ escaping _ diffusively from the jet vicinity can posses an extremely hard spectrum , with the power concentrated in particles near @xmath44 .",
    "the analogous acceleration processes can act at ultrarelativistic jets in blazars ( ostrowski [ 15 ] ) .",
    "however , due to expected decrease of acceleration efficiency with particle anisotropy , @xmath50 , the highest energies are still limited by the geometric condition @xmath48 . for characteristic conditions derived for such jets , @xmath51  g and @xmath52  cm , particle energies above @xmath16  ev can be obtained . when considered as the source of uhe crs escaping into the intergalactic space such processes can be further degraded by particle interactions with the strong ambient photon field and/or the diffuse medium near the active galactic nucleus in the parent galaxy . till",
    "now these possibilities were not discussed in detail .",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of cosmological structure formation yields extended flat or cylindrical supergalactic structures of compressed matter , including galaxy clusters as its sub - components .",
    "diffuse plasma accreted with velocities @xmath53  km / s at such extended at several mpc structures can form large scale shocks seen in radio observations mentioned in section 2 . considering uhe particle energization at such shocks ( e.g. kang et al .",
    "[ 12 ] ) in the process of fermi diffusive acceleration meets however serious obstacles . in the considered acceleration region with @xmath54 g",
    "magnetic field the @xmath0 ev proton posses a gyroradius @xmath55  mpc .",
    "thus ( cf .",
    "drury [ 9 ] ) , the particle mean free path @xmath56 leads to the unreasonably large diffusive region required for acceleration , with the size @xmath57  mpc ( ! ) , and the acceleration time comparable to the age of the universe . as",
    "the considered mean free path is the one normal to the shock surface , @xmath58 , the above authors considered the so called ` jokipii diffusion ' regime at perpendicular shocks ( i.e. where the shock normal is perpendicular to the mean magnetic field ) , with @xmath59 .",
    "such models formally allow for larger energies of accelerated particles , but can increase the upper energy limit in comparison to parallel shocks at most by a factor of a few ( if at all , cf . [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that the jokipii diffusion requires a medium amplitude perturbations of the magnetic field , and thus large mean free paths , @xmath60 , or drifts along the considered shock structure .    in some way",
    "analogous ( super)galactic scale shock can be formed and accelerate particles in the observed cases of colliding galaxies ( al - dargazelli et al . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , in analogy to the discussed above constraints the evaluation of the upper particle energy limit presented by these authors seems to be over optimistic .",
    "extremely powerful cosmic engines are provided by rapidly rotating neutron stars . of particular interest are the objects with magnetar - like magnetic fields ( @xmath61  g ) and rotation periods , @xmath62 , in the mili - second range .",
    "a rotating magnetosphere generates an electric field of the magnitude @xmath63 .",
    "multiplied by the stellar radius @xmath64 this field translates into a voltage @xmath65 , which could be used for acceleration of charged nuclei .",
    "however , the ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) pairs created in the pulsar magnetosphere will short circuit the above potential drop to values a few orders of magnitude lower ( cf .",
    "venkatesan et al .",
    "additionally , a more realistic geometry would introduce a further decrease of @xmath68 by a factor @xmath69 .",
    "if one takes into account a possible catastrophic energy changes in the strong magnetic field and the radiation field near the pulsar , the co - rotating field region of the pulsar magnetosphere does not seem to be a possible site for extremely energetic nuclei acceleration ( only iron or some other heavy nuclei , probably the not fully ionized ones , can be available there ) .",
    "venkatesan et al .",
    "[ 22 ] expect that the far field region , near the outer gap or even behind the light cylinder , can be a more promising acceleration site for uhe particles .",
    "however , no detailed model of such process was presented till now .",
    "as discussed by numerous authors the rapidly rotating magnetized neutron stars can be sources of ultra - relativistic winds , as ( probably ) seen in the centre of the crab nebula .",
    "if iron nuclei can be injected from the star surface into the magnetosphere , then they start to co - move with the forming wind , reaching its terminal velocity . as discussed by blasi et al .",
    "[ 6 ] for newly born neutron stars with @xmath70 ms and @xmath71  g the wind terminal lorentz factor can reach @xmath72 . thus the iron nuclei carried with the wind have in the ` laboratory ' frame typical energies @xmath73  ev . at the wind terminal shock the nuclei are injected into the interstellar medium with these energies",
    ". for sources distributed in our galaxy very small source efficiency is sufficient to explain particle flux observed at earth .",
    "of course , if such processes provide uhe crs , an anisotropy toward the galactic centre should be observed .",
    "however , as claim the above authors , if our galaxy posses an extended magnetized corona the anisotropy at the northern hemisphere pointing outside the galactic centre could be quite small at @xmath0  ev ( ? ) .",
    "one may note that the presented model contradicts interpretation of the fly eye result suggesting transition to lighter cosmic ray composition at highest energies .",
    "also efficiency of iron ions pull out from the neutron star surface is a theoretically undetermined quantity yet .",
    "observations show a much higher density of quasars in the early universe , at cosmological redshifts @xmath74 , than today .",
    "thus a number of present day galaxies must harbour supermassive black holes in their centres , some of them rapidly rotating",
    ". only an extremely low accretion rate due to lack of freshly acquired gas near such black holes makes them to be inactive ` dead quasars ' , without any clear radiative or jet observational signature .",
    "nevertheless , even a small accretion rate can bring magnetized plasma toward a rotating black hole and to form a stressed magnetosphere near to it .",
    "boldt & ghosh [ 7 ] estimate the magnetic field near the black hole horizon of a radius @xmath64 , to reach @xmath75  g and to generate an effective electromotive force @xmath76  v accelerating nuclei ( a black hole mass @xmath77m@xmath78 ) .",
    "this force could accelerate the observed uhe cosmic rays in nuclei of nearby inactive massive galaxies .",
    "however , an ability of the small amount of accreted plasma to keep the black hole magnetic field at @xmath79  g is not proved and should be discussed quantitatively .",
    "the observed approximately once a day gamma ray bursts are believed to originate from ultra - relativistic shocks , with the lorentz @xmath41 factors reaching values @xmath80 . basing on an oversimplified acceleration model vietri [ 21 ] and waxman [ 23 ] suggested that such shocks could provide uhe crs also .",
    "later discussions by gallant & achterberg [ 10 ] and bednarz & ostrowski [ 3 ] show that due to extreme particle anisotropy ( upstream of the shock the energetic particle distribution has an opening angle @xmath43 ) the acceleration process is gradual , with @xmath81 , and the considered scenarios for grb shock acceleration lead to particle energies up to @xmath82  ev",
    ". the situation could be more promising if the shock propagates in the region of strong magnetic field , like in the pulsar wind zone .",
    "however no one attempted to model such acceleration process including into consideration the pulsar wind velocity field with a possible large lorentz factor and the sector - like magnetic field structure .",
    "the process of particle reflection from the shock leading in principle to fast acceleration with @xmath83 is much less efficient than thought previously ( bednarz & ostrowski [ 4 ] ) .",
    "also stecker [ 19 ] pointed out that grbs , possibly following the star formation rate , are much less frequent in the local universe than in the young galaxies at redshifts above 1 .",
    "he evaluates that particles from such local _ unatenuated _ sources can explain only a small part of the observed particle flux at highest energies .",
    "thus , in our opinion , it is highly questionable if grbs could generate the observed highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the hillas [ 11 ] diagram presents possible astrophysical sources of ultra high energy particles on the plane ` @xmath11 versus @xmath84 ' ( @xmath84 - linear size of the source ) , where the regions of @xmath85 roughly define the allowed range for sources with the ` acceleration parameter ' @xmath1 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "hillas introduced @xmath1 as the respective velocity parameter for the studied acceleration mechanisms .",
    "traditional objects placed on the diagram include galaxy clusters , agns , frii radio sources and pulsars .",
    "recent particle acceleration models make the hillas diagram more densely populated due to taking into consideration objects like ` magnetars ' , ` dead quasars ' , or ultrarelativistic pulsar winds and grb shocks .",
    "they also require a more general meaning for the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "traditional approach considers @xmath1 to be comparable or smaller than unity . for example particle acceleration at relativistic shock can be characterized with @xmath86 , while the non - relativistic shock propagating with velocity @xmath87 yields at most @xmath88 . in the last expression",
    "the factor @xmath89 comes due to the fact that the source size must be greater than the required diffusive length scale @xmath90 for highly turbulent conditions ( cf . [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the processes like a particle reflection from an ultra - relativistic shock or a bulk flow acceleration on the cost of the pulsar wind poynting flux introduce a ` new dimension ' into the above efficiency considerations . the model of blasi et al .",
    "[ 6 ] considers particles resting with respect to the pulsar wind and introduces high energy particles when injected at the wind terminal shock .",
    "the model works well even with zero energy particles in the wind rest frame and - in this frame - the condition @xmath85 does not provide any limit to particle energy in the ` external observer ' rest frame . in the model involving acceleration by cosmic ray reflections from ultra - relativistic shocks of grbs the condition @xmath91 downstream the shock ( within the source ) yields @xmath92 after the reflection , and thus @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .    ability to accelerate particles up to ultra high energies @xmath38  ev by sources ( models ) discussed shortly in this paper ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) and a few further ones appearing in the literature is an open problem .",
    "very few of these propositions reached even a semi - quantitative level , involving a detailed modelling of individual particle acceleration .",
    "quite often for the evaluated process one assumes the physical conditions providing the most efficient acceleration , these conditions are usually only weakly constrained by observations . besides these reservations one should note a growing number of ` bottom - up ' models , using a classical physics to explain uhe cr origin .",
    "possibly one of these or a new proposed mechanism will prove to work .",
    "however , the main present day task for uhe cr astrophysics is to increase the number and quality of observational data , to allow for a more serious critical evaluation of the considered acceleration models and to discuss transport processes and forming the observed particle spectrum . in particular , besides the traditional questions about uhe cosmic rays ( spectrum , anisotropy , what particles we observe ) , a number of astrophysical issues must be resolved like understanding of the intergalactic magnetic field structure , confirmation or not of the ultrarelativistic winds from pulsars , existence or not of the galactic winds , direct detection and/or explaining composition of the cosmic dark matter , etc .",
    "when considering chances for understanding uhe cosmic rays one have to take into account the fact that we are still far from explaining mechanisms providing much better studied lower energy cosmic rays .",

    "to draw a version of the hillas plot presented on fig .",
    "2 we consider the situation with the magnetic field energy density being in equipartition with the plasma energy density upstream of the shock : the sound velocity in the upstream plasma is assumed @xmath94 km / s and the respective plasma density is defined by the equipartition condition .",
    "one should note that the magnetic field downstream of the shock , @xmath95 , is much stronger than the upstream value given at the horizontal axis . the compressed ( ` c ' ) upstream field reaches a downstream value @xmath96 higher , while in the often considered case of the equipartition ( ` e ' ) between the magnetic field and the plasma downstream of the shock the required field is higher by an additional large factor @xmath97 .",
    "the curves presented at fig .  2  solid lines for protons and dashed lines for iron nuclei  are plotted for particles reaching @xmath0 ev after reflection from the shock , as measured upstream of the shock . to draw the figure each value of the upstream magnetic field given at the x - axis",
    "was transformed downstream the shock according to the ` c ' or ` e ' prescription and a gyroradius @xmath98 ( eq .",
    "1 ) was derived for a particle with the energy @xmath99 and the transformed magnetic field @xmath95 .",
    "this value @xmath100 is given at the y - axis .",
    "one should note that the size @xmath84 has to be a distance between causally connected regions along the shock .",
    "for example for the spherical shock with a radius @xmath64 the condition @xmath101 has to be satisfied . on the figure , we do not present results for protons with the radiative loss time scale ( eq .  3 ) downstream of the shock shorter than the derived @xmath102 . for a reference at the upper right corner of each panel",
