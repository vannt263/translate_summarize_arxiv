    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) form an interesting class of short - period close binary systems comprising a hot white dwarf ( wd ) and a relatively lower mass red dwarf star filling its roche lobe @xcite . in such systems",
    "hydrogen - rich matter from the red dwarf exits through the inner lagrange point ( l1 ) and flows towards the white dwarf . in the absence of strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the matter forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf due to the excess angular momentum originating from the orbital motion of the binary @xcite . on - going accretion at a low rate ( quiescence )",
    "is interrupted every few weeks to months by intense accretion ( outburst ) of days to weeks - a dwarf nova ( dn ) accretion event @xcite , thereby increasing the luminosity of the systems by several magnitudes .",
    "a thermal instability in the accretion disk is believed to trigger the increase in the mass transfer rate ( @xmath6 ) through the disk and thus an increase in the rate of gravitational energy release @xcite .",
    "cv systems are divided in sub - classes according to the duration , occurrence and amplitude of their outburst @xcite : e.g. dwarf nova systems ( dns ) are non - magnetic and accrete through a disk , they spend most of their time in the quiescent state ; nova - like systems ( nls ) are disk - systems found mostly in the high outburst state ; polars are devoid of an accretion disk due to their strong magnetic fields ( the matter is funneled through the magnetic field lines onto the poles of the wd ) ; and intermediate polars ( ips ) have truncated inner disks due to their moderately strong magnetic fields .",
    "another cv subclass is the classical nova ( or just `` nova '' ; ) , characterized by an episode of unstable thermonuclear burning ( the thermonuclear runaway - tnr ; @xcite ) .",
    "all cv system are believed to undergo a classical nova explosion every few thousand years or more , when enough hydrogen - rich material accumulated in the envelope to reach the ignition point at the electron - degenerate base of the envelope - where it is compressed under the large gravity of the wd @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on the study of the non ( or weakly ) magnetized dn systems , where the accretion disk extends all the way to the surface of the wd .    since the white dwarf is the most common end - product of stellar evolution",
    "( @xmath7% of all the stars in the galaxy have evolved or will evolve into white dwarfs ) and the accretion disk is the most common universal structure resulting from mass transfer with angular momentum , and both can be directly observed in cataclysmic variable systems ( in the ultraviolet ) , an understanding of the accretion process in cataclysmic variables is the first step in a global understanding of accretion in other systems throughout the universe .",
    "these include young stellar objects , accretion onto neutron stars and black holes , and the most difficult to study , active galactic nuclei .",
    "therefore , accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables are the best _ astronomical laboratories _ to study the physics of accretion disks . +      in the disk , magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite due to a magneto - rotational instability @xcite dissipates potential energy and transfers angular momentum outward . as a result",
    ", the disk matter slowly spirals inwards towards the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the total potential energy of accretion can be released at the maximum rate @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the mass of the wd , @xmath11 its radius , @xmath6 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath12 is the keplerian angular velocity at one stellar radius @xmath11 .",
    "this is the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the accretion process per unit of time and the actual luminosity can be smaller than this ( see below ) . in the standard disk theory @xcite , the accretion disk is axisymmetric , geometrically thin in the vertical dimension ( it has a thickness @xmath13 such that @xmath14 ) , and the energy dissipated by the ( turbulent ) viscosity is instantly radiated locally in the @xmath15 directions .",
    "only half of the accretion luminosity is emitted by the disk ( @xmath16 ) , since the matter is still moving at a nearly keplerian velocity , @xmath17 , before it is ultimately accreted @xcite .",
    "the remaining accretion energy must , therefore , be dissipated in order for the matter to be accreted onto the surface of the more slowly rotating wd @xcite .",
    "the disk matter is decelerated in that region where the inner disk reaches the stellar surface : the boundary layer ( bl ) .",
    "the height of the bl can be comparable to the scale height @xmath13 of the accretion disk .",
    "the remaining rotational kinetic energy of the accreting matter dissipated in the boundary layer per unit of time ( @xmath18 ) is nearly equal to half of the total luminosity of the accreting matter ( @xmath19 ) , namely : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the stellar angular velocity .",
    "this is so because the material accreted onto the wd surface corotates with it and keeps a fraction of the rotational kinetic energy .",
    "@xcite , however , pointed out that part of the bl energy goes into spinning up the accreting star through the shear at the stellar equator , and hence , the fraction that can be radiated away is smaller than the one given in eq.(2 ) .",
    "namely , one has @xmath23 therefore , for a non - rotating wd : @xmath24 . however , for a rotating wd @xmath25 , and the total energy radiated from the accretion process ( @xmath26 ) is actually smaller than @xmath19 as defined by eq.(1 ) .",
    "the energy `` kept '' by the corotating accreted material per unit of time is : @xmath27 and the power invested to spin up the star through the shear at the equator ( eq.2-eq.3 ) is : @xmath28 l_{disk } =    2 \\beta ( 1- \\beta   )    l_{disk }   = \\beta ( 1 - \\beta ) l_{acc } .\\ ] ] the above relations are correct to order of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius at which the gradient of the angular velocity changes sign @xmath31 ( for further details of the one - dimensional analysis see also @xcite ) .",
    "usually @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath33 or smaller . for a wd star rotating at 10% of the keplerian velocity",
    "( i.e. several 100km / s ) the bl is expected to radiate @xmath34 , while a fraction of @xmath35 is invested in spinning up the star . for a wd star rotating at 30% of the keplerian velocity ( i.e. @xmath36km / s ) the bl is expected to radiate @xmath37 . for a star rotating near break - up the angular velocity in the disk does not have an extremum and decreases steadily outward , therefore the disk",
    "is expected to spin - down the fast rotating wd @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no boundary layer .",
    "since the bl is much smaller than the disk itself and each radiate almost equal amounts of energy , the disk emits mainly in the optical and near uv , whereas the much hotter bl emits in the far uv and in x - rays . during outburst , when @xmath38/yr @xcite , observations ( e.g. @xcite ) reveal that the bl is optically thick and emits mainly in the fuv and soft x - ray bands with an effective temperature @xmath39 of a few @xmath40k as expected by the theory ( @xcite ) . during quiescence , when @xmath41/yr @xcite , observations ( e.g. @xcite ) reveal that the boundary layer is optically thin and emits in the hard x - ray band with a temperature of the order of @xmath42k , as expected by the theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in addition , in the outer region of the bl , where the bl meets the disk , the optical thickness becomes larger again ( @xmath43 ) and that region emits in the fuv with a temperature @xmath39 reaching @xmath44k @xcite .",
    "observationally , it was shown almost three decades ago that non - magnetic cvs do emit some fraction of their luminosity in the x - ray bands ( e.g. @xcite ; the rosat all - sky survey @xcite ) . as expected from the one - dimensional standard disk and boundary layer theories , during quiescence hard x - rays ( 10kev and higher )",
    "were observed from a small region close to the wd ( e.g. @xcite ) , while during outburst this emission is replaced by soft x - ray and euv ( see e.g. the review of @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the euv region of the spectrum is very difficult to observe because the absorption cross section of ( ism ) neutral hydrogen is very high . because of this",
    ", only a few systems have been successfully observed in the euv , such as e.g. vw hyi ( @xcite ; for which @xmath45@xmath46 , @xcite ) . assuming that the x - ray and euv emissions are from the bl , and the optical and uv emissions are from the disk , many previous studies found a very low ratio @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xcite ) during outburst , and a ratio of @xmath49 in quiescence ( e.g. for vw hyi , @xcite assuming that the wd contributes 50 percent of the uv flux ) .",
    "the x - ray observations of _ underluminous _ boundary layers culminated with the _ rosat _ observations of ten cataclysmic variables ( ba cam , yz cnc , gp com , vw hyi , wx hyi , ty psa , v3885 sgr , cy uma , cy vel , ix vel ) by @xcite , in which 8 systems were caught in quiescence and 2 systems were caught in outburst .",
    "@xcite derived x - ray fluxes from their observations and uv fluxes from existing _",
    "observations and found that ratio of the x - ray luminosity to the uv+optical luminosity is much smaller than one .",
    "many processes were discussed to explain the `` missing boundary layer '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea was that the kinetic energy of the bl could also be converted into winds ( e.g. @xcite ) , wd or belt rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) , heating ( e.g. @xcite ; or maybe advected into the outer stellar envelop ( e.g .. @xcite ) .",
    "some systems have been observed to have a wd rotating at a rather large rotational velocity , of the order of @xmath50km / sec ( e.g. @xcite ) , which implies ( from eq.3 ) @xmath51 .",
    "however , the observed x - ray luminosities have been much smaller than this and would imply a near - keplerian rotation rate for many systems , which is not the case .",
    "recent xmm - newton observations @xcite , taking into account the contribution of the disk , wd and bl in the optical , uv and x - ray bands , found no evidence of an underluminous bl in 8 quiescent dwarf novae ( oy car , ww cet , ab dra , u gem , vw hyi , t leo , ty psa , su uma ) and the data are consistent with @xmath52 .",
    "the main difference with previous studies was that the wd contribution was taken into account with realistic temperatures taken from the literature and could dominate over the disk in the uv .",
    "@xcite basically assumed @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and found @xmath55 for 6 objects among 8 . for vw hyi and u gem",
    "( with @xmath56 respectively ) they suggest that the inner disk is truncated at @xmath57 to explain the discrepancy .",
    "@xcite further computed the contribution of all the emitting components ( wd , disk , bl ) in the optical , uv and x - ray based on the existing multiwavelength observations of vw hyi , the standard disk model @xcite and @xcite s model of the boundary layer .",
    "@xcite has shown that ( in quiescence ) the bl emits part of it energy in the uv band from that region where the outer edge of the bl meets ( and radiates energy into ) the optically thick inner edge of the disk .",
    "@xcite suggested that the second component often observed in the quiescent uv spectra of dne ( the so - called accretion belt also detected in the _ fuse _ spectra of vw hyi  @xcite ) is the uv emission from the outer bl .",
    "taking the uv contribution of this second component ( @xmath58 ) into account @xcite showed that the luminosity of the bl of vw hyi in quiescence ( @xmath59 ) is as expected from the theory ( namely @xmath60 ) , therefore agreeing with @xcite that _ there is no missing boundary layer _ even for vw hyi and without disk truncation .",
    "on the other hand , spectroscopic uv observations of accreting wds have also reached a rather advanced stage .",
    "observations have been carried out for a range of cvs , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to cite just a few ) in quiescence and outburst .",
    "the observations suggest that the spectrum is made up of several parts , specifically , the underlying wd , the accretion disk , the accretion belt that might form on the surface of the star , the hot spot ( where the matter inflowing from the l1 point hits the outer rim of the accretion disk ) .",
    "the temperature of each of these components proves to be a most important diagnostic , though as better data come in , we can hope that other hydrodynamical variables also become important diagnostics .",
    "the case of vw hydri is especially important because stis measurements @xcite have captured that object during its transition to outburst .",
    "the vw hyi transition to outburst caught by _",
    "stis _ was apparently an outside - in outburst .",
    "the uv lagged the optical .",
    "the _ stis _ showed that longer fuv wavelengths changed much faster and manifested the flux sooner than shorter wavelengths .",
    "it has been found that the temperature of the accreting star can be raised by as much as 50% during outburst .",
    "the elevated wd temperature returns to its quiescence value soon after the outburst . the elevated surface temperature of the star may , therefore , be a good diagnostic of the energy dissipated as the accretion stream impacts , spreads out and slows down and reaches co - rotation with the star . the rate at which the wd cools following the heating during the outburst is not only diagnostic of the mass / depth of the heated surface layers but also potentially a good diagnostic of the optical depth of the accreted material . a detailed understanding of bl physics may also help one understand the so - called uv delay where the rise in the uv emission lags the rise in the optical by several hours , indicating that the uv emission might be more symptomatic of the physics of the bl @xcite .",
    "it is important to note here that our present numerical simulations are relevant to the changes in the wd temperature observed on a time scale of the order of outburst / quiescence cycle ( e.g. vw hyi ) , and do not apply to compressional heating taking place on a much longer evolutionary time scale @xcite .",
    "+      the bl has typically been solved in a model where the averaging of the vertical structure which is employed in accretion disk studies @xcite has been extrapolated to the surface .",
    "one also makes the additional simplifying assumption that the vertical velocity in the boundary layer is zero , just as it is in the outer parts of a thin disk model .",
    "this reduces the description of the bl to a one dimensional problem in the radial direction @xcite , where one actually solves the `` slim disk '' equations for the bl region ( namely , the one - dimensional disk equations + radiation in the radial direction ; as first proposed in the pioneering work of @xcite ) . however , this assumption is not necessarily correct since the bl may spread out @xcite .",
    "the best one - dimensional models of the bl @xcite predict a rise in the bl temperature during outburst that is much larger than the observed one .    recognizing the multi - dimensionality of the problem several authors attacked the problem directly using numerical methods ( e.g. @xcite ) culminating in simulations which included flux - limited radiative transport as well as different viscosities @xcite .",
    "however , while the efforts of @xcite were very bold and impressive , the high numerical resolution needed to solve the problem has until now precluded following the problem numerically on a long evolution time scale and or resolving the fine structure of the flow .",
    "the importance of the meridional flow was demonstrated in protostars and fu ori stars already by @xcite , who show how matter spread to the poles to completely engulf the accreting star .",
    "however , in accretion onto a compact star the problem has not been solved because of the much smaller scales .",
    "as the numerical two - dimensional simulations failed to follow the evolution of the accretion onto the surface of the compact star , an analytical approach was developed by @xcite , who implemented the one - dimensional bl equations with an analytic treatment of the meridional direction ( assuming a shallow - water equation ) , where the vertical velocity in the boundary layer is permitted to be non - zero .",
    "this analytical treatment was carried out for an accreting neutron - star ( ns ) , and it was shown that the bl could `` spread '' and cover a significant part of the ns .",
    "later on , @xcite applied inogamov & sunyaev s treatment of the `` spread layer '' to accreting white dwarf in outburst ( the optically thick case ) .",
    "the analytical work of @xcite indicates that the numerical setup must include sufficient resolution in the radial and meridional planes to capture the dynamics and fine structure of the bl .",
    "it is the purpose of the present simulations to actually provide such a numerical study , by following the evolution of the accretion onto ( and into ! ) the surface of the wd in the inner region of the disk and close to the equatorial plane ( @xmath61deg ) .    in the one dimensional picture",
    "the energy kept by the corotating accreted material per unit time is given by eq.4 . in two dimension , however , as the matter possibly spreads evenly onto the wd surface , its moment of inertia is rather similar to that of a spherical shell and the energy kept by the accreted material per unit of time becomes @xmath62 and the remaining energy ( eq.4)-(eq.6 ) @xmath63 is available to further spin up the wd . as the matter moves toward the poles , to spread evenly on the wd surface , it has excess of angular velocity / momentum ( due to the differential velocity ) which is added to the accreting wd .",
    "we therefore see that even for the most simplistic two - dimensional model of the boundary layer , the spreading of matter on the wd surface involves a significant fraction of the accretion energy ( e.g. up to 10% of the disk luminosity for a star rotating at 1,000km / sec  eq.7 ) . in the case of a star rotating near break - up velocity , accretion at the equator",
    "_ adds angular momentum to the star as the matter spreads toward higher latitudes_. this contributes to a balancing effect to the spin - down of the an accreting star rotating near break - up as described by @xcite .",
    "the structure of the bl is important to help disentangle and physically characterize the different emitting components in an accreting wd system .",
    "the details of the emitted spectrum depends sensitively on the detailed structure of the boundary layer and how it changes in response to enhanced rates of accretion @xcite .",
    "the boundary layer is also important because it may play a role in the still uncertain mechanism which drives the outflowing bi - polar winds seen in dwarf novae during outburst and in nova - like variables during their high optical brightness states .",
    "our boundary layer simulations will eventually provide the theoretical framework required to physically interpet the x - ray , euv and fuv emission observed in compact binaries containing accreting degenerate stars .    however , the structure of the bl is also important because it determines how the accreted matter ultimately distributes itself in the envelope of the wd , which is important for classical novae . in classical novae ,",
    "the thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) ejects part or all of the envelope .",
    "the initial cno composition of the burning material should be strongly enhanced compared to the accreted material to account for composition of the observed ejecta @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested for this cno enhancement ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they can be roughly divided into pre - burst mixing between accreted material and the underlying co rich wd @xcite by accretion driving instabilities or mixing with the underlying material when the convective zone of the thermonuclear runaway extends deep enough to dredge up co material @xcite .    however , before an exploration of the radiation emission characteristics of the boundary layer can be carried out with full radiation hydrodynamics , we must understand the dynamical processes that lead to the formation of the boundary layer . in this first stage",
    "our goal is to calculate the dynamical structure of the boundary layer with sufficient numerical resolution to capture the dynamical evolution of the accretion flow and its interaction with the stellar surface ( see @xcite ) , and we leave the radiation - hydrodynamical study for later .    our model is presented in section  [ sec : model ] , the results are given and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] presents the conclusions .",
    "the equations we are solving are written down explicitly in appendix  [ appendix : model ] while the initial and boundary conditions are described in appendix  [ appendix : domainsetup ] .",
    "the source of the angular momentum transport in the bl probably involves a combination of magnetic fields and turbulence .",
    "since the angular velocity in the bl is not a decreasing function of radial distance from the star , it is not clear that the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite provides angular momentum transport in the bl .",
    "actually , @xcite found that the effective alpha viscosity parameter @xmath2 would go to zero for a rotation law @xmath64 when @xmath65 . nor is the mri essential at the bl because the accretion disk can directly exchange angular momentum and mass with the outer layers of the star if an efficient coupling mechanism is found between the disk and the star .",
    "the source of viscosity at the bl is still debated in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite assumed that the viscosity is due to purely hydrodynamical turbulence as in the deceleration of subsonic or supersonic flow above a solid surface .",
    "the case for a purely hydrodynamical turbulence in the boundary layer was already debated earlier @xcite , however the physical process is likely to take place in three dimensions @xcite , e.g. by means of streamwise vortices ( e.g. @xcite ) . the most common instability in a flow over a _ curved surface _",
    ", is that of the boundary layer flow over a concave surface unstable to the centrifugal instability ( as it violates rayleigh s criterion for stability  @xcite ) .",
    "this instability leads to turbulence through the formation of the grtler vortices @xcite , which tap energy from the laminar flow and poor it into the turbulence ( this is a non - linear instability leading to a subcritical transition to turbulence ) .",
    "however , the boundary layer flow on a convex surface is not subject to this instability , rather the opposite , the centrifugal force in such a flow is `` restoring '' .",
    "therefore , the instability that is the most likely to take place in the star - disk boundary layer is the kelvin - helmhotz shearing instability which will occur for a sufficiently large shear ( richardson criteria , e.g. @xcite ) .    following @xcite , we parametrize the efficiency of the angular momentum transport with an @xmath2 viscosity prescription . in a multidimensional calculation",
    "@xmath2 has to be spatially concentrated at the accretion disk and the stellar surface and the formulations developed in @xcite and @xcite are used here . specifically , we used @xmath66 where @xmath13 is the scale height of the disk and @xmath67 is the local pressure scale height in the boundary layer .",
    "for these calculations , the pressure scale height in the boundary layer that develops on the surface of the star is always smaller than the scale height of the disk .",
    "the compressible navier - stokes equations themselves are written explicitly in the appendix [ appendix : model ] . describing",
    "the angular momentum transport with a simple shear coefficient means that the dynamics follows the navier - stokes equations . here",
    "the navier - stokes equations as given by @xcite are solved in spherical coordinates ( @xmath68,@xmath69,@xmath70 ) on an axisymmetric mesh with 384 ratioed zones in the radial direction and 128 ratioed zones in the meridional range spanning 0 to 30 degrees from the disk plane  same as @xcite .",
    "the star was taken to be a non - rotating @xmath71 wd with a radius of @xmath72 .",
    "the radial extent of our computational domain extended from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "the r - directional zones were concentrated towards the inner radial boundary with each zone being 1% larger than the previous one .",
    "the @xmath69-directional zones were also ratioed with the smallest zones being closest to the equator and each zone being 1.9% larger than the previous one .",
    "such a ratioed zoning makes it possible for us to capture five scale heights of the star s atmosphere as well as the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "the zone ratioing also concentrates zones around the disk - star interface .",
    "unlike @xcite , who used a mesh with 85 zones in each of the radial and meridional directions , our mesh has substantially better resolution .",
    "the scale heights of wd atmospheres are now known to be substantially smaller than estimated in @xcite , making the larger meshes used in this work more essential .",
    "the higher resolutions , as well as the use of higher order godunov methods , enable us to substantially reduce the role of numerical diffusion .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to study not just the spin - down of the accretion disk but also the spin - up of the star . for that reason , we retained five scale heights of the wd s outer atmosphere .",
    "care was taken to resolve each stellar scale height in the radial direction with at least twenty zones , which ensures a numerically accurate , well - resolved and stable stellar atmosphere . to ensure good resolution of the disk s structure , we retained at least fifty zones across a disk scale height in the meridional direction .",
    "the physical conditions describing the structure of the disk are given in appendix [ appendix : domainsetup ] .",
    "typical surface temperatures for hydrodynamically accreting wds are @xmath75 30,000k and typical disk temperatures are usually taken to be @xmath75 100,000k .",
    "this choice of temperatures would make the scale heights of the disk and wd atmosphere too small to be resolved with the above - mentioned resolutions .",
    "for this reason , we systematically allow the temperatures of both the disk and wd atmosphere to be one order of magnitude larger than the physical values . as a result",
    ", the simulations were carried out with a stellar temperature of t=300,000k and a disk temperature of t=1,000,000k .",
    "while this might seem be a hot temperature for a disk in a cv , it is still much less than the virial temperature and the corresponding disk thickness is @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 for a @xmath40k disk .",
    "the sound speed used in the formulae for the viscosity @xmath78 was derived for the temperatures used in the simulations .",
    "we assume a very tenuous and very hot halo which consists of the same material as the disk ( and the star ) .",
    "the mass in this halo is extremely small , making the halo dynamically unimportant and its sole use is to provide pressure balance at the upper boundaries of the accretion disk and the star .",
    "the fluids that make up the disk , halo and stellar atmosphere were tagged with passive scalars and we are , therefore , in a position to assert that the halo gas simply provides pressure support with minimal mixing into the gas that makes up the disk or the stellar atmosphere . such a model with a disk and halo that are in dynamical equilibrium with each other",
    "was briefly described in @xcite .",
    "since that previous work did not include the stellar atmosphere , appendix [ appendix : domainsetup ] describes the physical conditions that were assumed to set up the wd atmosphere , the accretion disk and the halo .",
    "symmetry across the disk plane is assumed .",
    "observations , and their interpretation in the context of the @xcite model have suggested that the interesting values of @xmath2 range from 0.1 during outburst to 0.001 during quiescence . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath79 in the boundary layer from the xmm - newton observations of vw hyi in quiescence @xcite .",
    "for that reason , we performed a parameter study with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the same value of @xmath2 was used in the boundary layer and in the disk .",
    "this would seem to be a very reasonable assumption if the same physical mechanism ( such as a thermal instability , @xcite or magnetic instability @xcite ) were to make the disk fluid and the boundary layer fluid turbulent .",
    "our simulations do not include the effect of radiative transfer in the boundary layer .",
    "it is worth noting that in the optically thick limit , the bl retains most of the energy that is generated by the viscous stresses . as a result , by retaining the viscous energy generation terms in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] and assuming that the alpha viscosity parameter is large ( @xmath85 ) we mimic the situation where the boundary layer is optically thick during outburst .",
    "simulations were also carried out by excluding the viscous energy generation terms in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] and assuming @xmath86 ; in that situation we mimic the limit where the boundary layer is optically thin during quiescence , i.e. the bl radiates away all the heat that is generated by the viscous stresses .",
    "our results , therefore , bracket the two extreme cases . should the high @xmath2 simulations produce bls with optical depths in excess of @xmath87 or @xmath88 , the optically thick runs would find direct applicability to the astrophysical problem . likewise , should the low @xmath2 simulations produce optically thin boundary layers , the optically thin runs would find direct applicability to the astrophysical problem .",
    "we show in the course of this work that such trends are indeed observed in the simulations . in future work",
    ", we will include a treatment of the radiative transfer terms in the bl thus obtaining results that are free of current limitations .",
    "the full range of simulations that we report on here with the various values of @xmath2 and the inclusion or exclusion of viscous energy generation terms are listed in table 1 .",
    "since the inner radial boundary extends into the star , we enforced reflective boundary conditions at that boundary .",
    "while such a boundary condition would reflect any waves that reached the star s surface , we find that in practice the waves do not propagate to this depth in the present simulations .",
    "the use of such a reflective boundary condition represents a compromise . while it might reflect back waves that propagate more than five scale heights into the star",
    ", our experience has shown that surface waves almost never propagate to that depth .",
    "the present boundary conditions do have the positive consequence that they prevent any unexpected mass or momentum inflow into the computational domain from the rest of the star .",
    "the outer radial ( computational ) boundary was designed to respond to inflow or outflow of fluid at the outer open boundary , and it was therefore treated by imposing the boundary conditions on the characteristics of the flow as described in @xcite .",
    "thus outer boundary conditions were imposed directly on the incoming characteristics , and computed values from the variables inside the domain were imposed ( propagated ) on the outgoing characteristics .",
    "the strategy works well , especially when combined with riemann solvers which also work on the same principle of resolving the inflowing and outflowing waves .",
    "the equatorial boundary condition in the @xmath69-direction was reflective ( symmetric ) and the boundary condition at the other @xmath69-directional boundary was specified as continue .",

    "thus , physically thick boundary layers form in outburst and the result is independent of whether the viscous energy generation is included in the energy equation .",
    "the boundary layers that form in quiescence tend to be physically thin .",
    "this shows that the viscosity is the primary discriminant in determining the structure of the bl .",

    "the velocity vectors in figs .",
    "1b and 1d show a similar trend though it is harder to see because of the smaller physical extent of the bl .",
    "such a velocity structure is also known to occur in terrestrial fluid dynamics when a viscous fluid flows over a stationary solid surface , forming a boundary layer at the solid s surface .",
    "this shows us that our simulations are producing a valid result which is consistent with our intuition .",
    "it also shows us that our decision to refer to these star - disk layers as boundary layers is well - motivated .",
    "the accretion rate is high enough in the @xmath80 cases that the infalling matter depresses the stellar atmosphere close to the equator . while this is not so evident in fig .",
    "1a1d , we will show in section  [ subsec : grav ] that the infalling matter can excite gravity waves on the surface of the star .",
    "likewise , in section  [ subsec : ang_pol ] we will show that the high @xmath2 case spins up a significant portion of the star s atmosphere while itself being spun down .",

    "2 also shows us that for the high @xmath2 cases the accretion rate seems to drop off with time .",
    "this is entirely a result of the fact that this round of simulations does not include radiative transfer . as a result",
    ", the base of the boundary layer heats up , with a corresponding increase in pressure .",
    "the radiative cooling times in a real accretion disk are short enough ( i.e. even smaller than an orbital time ) that the boundary layer would cool down quite rapidly .",
    "the consequent pressure reduction would then permit accretion to proceed unimpeded .",
    "because of resolution constraints , we had to use temperatures that are somewhat larger than those that prevail on accreting white dwarfs . in subsequent work , we intend to overcome this constraint .",
    "it is , nevertheless , interesting to relate physical depth to optical depth of the boundary layer . in doing that",
    ", it is important to exclude the disk fluid that is spinning close to the keplerian velocity .",
    "we , therefore , define the disk - boundary layer interface as the region where the gradient of the angular velocity vanishes : @xmath93 at @xmath94 . in the boundary layer ( @xmath95 ) the matter is spinning with a toroidal velocity that is smaller than the keplerian velocity . for that sub - keplerian accreted material , we plot the optical depth due to thompson scattering as a function of meridional angle in fig .",
    "we define the optical depth as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the thomson scattering opacity of a fully ionized solar composition .",
    "this constitutes the minimum amount of scattering and thus provides a lower bound of the opaqueness of the matter .",
    "the boundary layer is technically defined by the radius where the radial gradient of the accretion flow s angular velocity disappears .",
    "we use that definition for the rest of this paper . because we track the fluids that make the disk , halo and star , we are in a position to isolate just the disk material that is within the boundary layer .",
    "the optical depth of this material ( in the radial direction ) is very important because it sets the emission characteristics of the accretion belts that have been identified in the observational literature .",
    "3 shows us that physically thick boundary layers in the high-@xmath2 limit also tend to be optically thick while physically thin boundary layers in the low-@xmath2 limit tend to be optically thin .",
    "the physical implication of that is that during outburst the bl could suppress the emission from a fraction of the star s surface .",
    "if the bl is optically thick with an optical depth @xmath98 then the hottest part of the boundary layer , which prevails at the disk - star interface would not be visible .",
    "however , during both the transitions , from outburst to quiescence and vice - versa , it is possible that this hot layer might become visible , giving one a direct view of boundary layer heating .",
    "this might show up as an additional uv component such as the one seen by @xcite in vw hydri during its transition from quiescence to outburst .",
    "a similar uv component has been detected in u gem by @xcite during its transition from outburst to quiescence . obtaining matched measurements of the velocity and",
    "uv excesses would allow one to further corroborate the scenario presented here .",
    "we see that the model in fig .",
    "1a produces an optically thick boundary layer during outburst .",
    "it is , therefore , consistent with our claim in section 2 that inclusion of the viscous dissipation term in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] provides a rather realistic representation of the structure of the boundary layer in outburst .",
    "likewise , the model in fig .",
    "1d , results in an optically thin boundary layer during quiescence .",
    "it is thus consistent with our claim that excluding the viscous dissipation term in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] is similarly more representative of the structure of the boundary layer in quiescence .",
    "figs 4a and 4b show the logarithm of the pressure in the boundary layer with @xmath80 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "figs 4c and 4d do the same for the runs with the same values of @xmath2 but with the viscous heating switched off in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] .    from figs . 4a and",
    "4b we see that the pressure of the accreted fluid is highest in the equatorial plane .",
    "this high pressure can be attributed to a combination of viscous dissipation as well as the ram pressure due to infall of accreting material .",
    "the pressure gradient in the meridional direction on the surface of the star , therefore , drives the meridional flow that develops on the wd s surface .",
    "the models that were used in figs . 4c and",
    "4d did not include viscous heating in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : heatequation ] ] .",
    "they , nevertheless , show that the pressure of the accreted fluid is highest in the equatorial plane and in this instance , the increased pressure is entirely attributable to the ram pressure due to infall of accreting material .",
    "we also see that the equatorial pressure increase in fig .",
    "4b is less than that in fig .",
    "4a and , similarly , for figs .",
    "4b and 4d . the smaller pressures in figs",
    "4c and 4d relative to figs . 4a and",
    "4b can be attributed to the additional contribution from viscous heating .",
    "4a4d , therefore , serves to show us that the formation of the pressure gradient in the meridional direction , which then drives the meridional flow in the boundary layer , is a very commonplace phenomenon . in other words ,",
    "any flow that is put in a similar geometry and is made to experience similar viscous stresses would naturally form a similar boundary layer , showing the ubiquity of boundary layer formation .",
    "( the only other requirement that such a bl flow has to satisfy as the disk material migrates polewards on the star s surface is the ability to lose angular momentum .",
    "the next sub - section will show that it can accomplish this very efficiently by spinning up the underlying layers of the stellar atmosphere . )",
    "thus the decision by @xcite to include a non - zero meridional velocity in their models was of central importance in forming the inherently multi - dimensional boundary layers that we see in our simulations .",
    "such boundary layers also form in accreting neutron stars , and ttauri stars that are going through the fu orionis phenomenon @xcite .      as the simulations start , the shear force transfers angular momentum between differentially rotating disk annuli so that matter can move inwards and accrete on the star at the footpoint of the disk .",
    "angular momentum transfer between the disk material and the stellar surface is also necessary so matter can move to higher latitudes .",
    "otherwise , the centrifugal barrier prevents matter from leaving the footpoint of the disk .",
    "it is this transfer of angular momentum which spins up the existing surface layers of the star .",
    "angular momentum is also directly advected onto the star , because the orbiting disk material eventually accretes and forms the new surface .",
    "fig.5a shows the resulting specific angular momentum after 3/4 of a keplerian evolution for the @xmath80 case , whereas fig.5b shows it for the @xmath84 case .",
    "fig.5a shows that the halo is spun up as is the underlying star at the footpoint , where the disk connects with the star .",
    "moreover , we observe that by this time in the simulation the disk material has spun up all five atmospheric scale heights of the star at equatorial latitudes . at higher latitudes the spreading disk material is less dense and",
    "thus takes longer amounts of time to drag the star s surface around with it . in fig.5b , which is at the same time as fig.5a and",
    "uses the same color scale , we see that the disk has not spun up the star s atmosphere even at the stellar equator .    fig.6 shows the toroidal velocity and sound speed in the disk s midplane as a function of radius for the simulated alpha - viscosities .",
    "the cases of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 do not show any significant spin - up of the star after 3/4 of a keplerian rotation , whence there is not significant shear connection between the disk and the stellar surface .",
    "therefore disk matter retains its keplerian motion much closer to the star which means that even though the accretion rates are smaller , significant amounts of the dissipation can still be generated in the bl close to the star .",
    "the matter in the layers of the star that we simulate is indeed non - degenerate .",
    "even so , the high temperatures cause it to have a rather low specific molecular viscosity . as a result , turbulence and/or threaded magnetic fields might nevertheless be the two most prominent ways to transfer a significant amount of angular momentum to the deeper layers of the wd @xcite , where the relative motion drives the mixing between the accreted surface material and the deeper layers .",
    "a supersonic component in the toroidal direction over most of the bl is obtained for all values of @xmath2 ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "the supersonic toroidal velocities mean that the flows are susceptible to the rapid development of gravity wave and/or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in three dimensions .",
    "such instabilities can be studied by taking a small slice of the interface from our simulations and extending it in the toroidal direction in a three dimensional simulation .",
    "our present simulations could then provide the velocities which drive such instabilities .",
    "the calculation of the turbulent mixing which obtains from these instabilities must therefore be calculated using other models @xcite .",
    "7a shows the poloidal mach number of the accreted material on the surface of the star for @xmath80 .",
    "7b shows the same for @xmath84 .",
    "the same scale is used for both figures .",
    "we see that the mach number is mildly transonic in fig .",
    "7a while it is subsonic in fig .",
    "7b . only the @xmath80 case has a transonic component in the poloidal directions , whereas the poloidal flows for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 remain subsonic ( see figs . 5a and 5b )",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present simulations are based on an alpha - viscosity formulation , which implicitly assumes an underlying model for the sub - scale turbulence .",
    "however , the material that accretes on to a white dwarf has very low viscosity .",
    "observations have not revealed the existence of magnetic fields at the wd surface . besides , the radial gradient of the angular velocity has the wrong sign for the mri to act .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to explore the role of other hydrodynamical instabilities at the surface of the star .",
    "it is important to remember that the alpha - viscosity formulation does smear the velocity gradients . yet ,",
    "if these gradients are amenable to the development of a persistent hydrodynamical instability then the simulation should reveal its existence to us .",
    "it is in that spirit that we try to identify an instability that might give rise to a sub - scale hydrodynamical turbulence on an accreting white dwarf s surface .",
    "there are several instabilities that can possibly lead to turbulence in boundary layers , such as the centrifugal instability ( rayleigh s criterion ) , the shearing kelvin - helmholtz instability , or even the rayleigh - taylor instability ( buoyancy forces ) .",
    "depending on the exact angular velocity profile , pressure and density gradients each of the forces involved compete , some are stabilizing while other are destabilizing . the sufficient condition for linear stability of a rotating , radially stratified fluid under the influence of ( a radial ) gravity was given by @xcite @xmath99 where , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the angular and vertical mode numbers ( in cylindrical coordinates @xmath102 ) , @xmath103 is defined as @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the effective gravity defined as @xmath106 @xmath107 is the schwarzschild discriminant @xcite @xmath108 in which @xmath109 is the adiabatic density gradient ; and @xmath0 is the rayleigh discriminant @xcite @xmath110 in the present case we do not consider vertical modes @xmath101 and only consider the equatorial flow for which @xmath111 .",
    "there are two distinct cases as follows .",
    "the axi - symmetric case ( mode @xmath112 ) gives the solberg - hiland criterion @xcite @xmath113 the perturbations of an accretion disk to a convective instability has already been studied in this context @xcite . in the limit of vanishing rotational velocity , the solberg - hiland criterion simply leads to the classical schwarzschild condition @xmath114 @xcite , which is also the condition in the vertical direction in the disk @xcite . in the limit of a vanishing gradient of the density , the solberg - hiland criterion simplifies to rayleigh s criterion for rotating fluids .",
    "the axi - symmetric instability in the boundary layer could possibly lead to a ring - like structure oscillating and in many ways similar to the `` breathing '' mode of an unstable star .",
    "this mode will not lead to turbulence , but could it explain the short period oscillations observed in cvs ?",
    "the mode would depend on the density , temperature and rotation rate ( solberg - hiland criterion ) , and its period and coherence would vary with these parameters .",
    "however , dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) in cvs exhibit a 180deg phase jump at eclipse @xcite , and frequency doubling ( presence of the first harmonic @xcite , and therefore they can not be explained by an @xmath112 mode . on the other hand , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in cvs",
    "do not all exhibit the same characteristics ( some are believed to form at larger radii in the disk ) , and , therefore , we can not completely rule out the @xmath112 mode in the boundary layer as an additional mechanism to produce quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the non - axisymmetric case . in the case",
    "@xmath115 , a sufficient condition for stability that does not involve @xmath101 is @xcite @xmath116 this condition is usually written in the form of a modified richardson number @xmath117 this is a generalization of the miles - howard theorem ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the miles - howard theorem itself reduces to the original richardson criterion @xcite when compressibility is omitted and the schwarzschild discriminant is replaced by the buoyancy term alone .",
    "the modified richardson number was considered in a few analytical studies to analyze the stability of material accreting on the surface of a white dwarf @xcite . here",
    ", we have the opportunity to use results from numerical simulations to evaluate the modified richardson number in the boundary layer . using the definition of the ledoux discriminant @xcite , @xmath118 the ( modified ) richardson condition for stability",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we show the richardson number , @xmath124 in the @xmath70-direction ( eqs .",
    "10 , 11 ) , for run 91 and 95 .",
    "the richardson number is smaller than 1/4 in most of the domain and therefore the flow is unstable .",
    "it is important to remark that while the shear could stabilize the flow @xcite , internal gravity waves can be reflected from a shear layer @xcite , and can be over - reflected from a rigid boundary @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that modes can be unstable at the star - disk interface due to the propagation through the corotation @xcite .",
    "unstable modes could be trapped and grow between ( i ) the surface of the wd and the strong shear region ; and/or ( ii ) between the strong shear region and the corotation radius at larger radii in the inner disk , in a manner similar to the papaloizou - pringle instability @xcite observed in simulations of disks with a rigid inner boundary @xcite .",
    "the question of how the instability will develop can not be addressed without full 3d simulations , which are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , a richardson number @xmath125 in the boundary layer region and _ at _ the stellar surface raises the possibility of an instability .",
    "this instability could develop in the form of waves in the `` spread layer '' as studied by @xcite to explain dnos in cvs , and raises the possibility of strong mixing between the hydrogen rich freshly accreted material and the wd material .      for the @xmath80 case , the outer edge of the boundary layer ( where @xmath126 ) is located at @xmath127 .",
    "at @xmath128 , @xmath129 is about 92% of @xmath130 .",
    "this means that only 84% of the gravitational pull is supported by the centrifugal force while the rest is supported by pressure .",
    "the pressure for @xmath80 is illustrated in fig.4a and comes from the build up of density due to the high accretion rate facilitated by the high viscosity which drags down material from the disk and also keeps it from moving rapidly towards the poles once it makes contact with the wd surface .",
    "this results in a dense band at the foot point of the disk which causes a surface gravity wave of surface matter to spread towards the poles .",
    "such surface gravity waves have been studied in the context of terrestrial physics by @xcite and the role of turbulence in exciting these waves has also been studied @xcite and the simulations show a similar phenomenon on the surface of strongly accreting white dwarfs .",
    "the matter inflow is , however , sufficiently large to cause the disk material to overflow the gravity wave supersonically as described above and shown in fig.5a .",
    "our present simulations do not show any evidence of wave breaking .",
    "however , should wave breaking reveal itself in simulations where the accretion is more vigorous , it would provide a further mechanism for directly mixing accreted material with the cno - rich material that lies beneath the surface of the white dwarf .    the propensity for the creation of gravity waves and their magnitude decreases rapidly with lower values of @xmath2 . even for @xmath81 ,",
    "the effect is only marginal and for lower values it is no longer present .",
    "the effect is thus only present for large values of @xmath2 , and possibly during dwarf novae in the outburst stage .",
    "furthermore the gravity wave might be transient as the surface adjusts to a fluctuations in the accretion rate . for lower values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the matter accretes slowly inwards and spreads towards the poles in a uniformly thick layer .",
    "the local rate of energy dissipation depends on the divergence of the angular velocity @xcite , so fig.6 also indirectly shows where heat is released .",
    "fig.9a shows that the supersonic impact of the accretion flow dissipates the most energy .",
    "however , energy is also dissipated at the interface between the bl and the surface .",
    "this is better seen in fig.9b which shows that the toroidally rotating matter dissipates rotational kinetic energy along its entire interface with the surface as it slides against it .    in situations where the bl is optically thin",
    ", the radiation will be emitted from the very same regions where the heat is generated in fig .",
    "this may explain the optically thin bl and line emission seen in observations of u gem during the quiescent phase ( see also : @xcite ) . even in outburst , fig .",
    "3 shows that the optically thick boundary layer has an optical depth of   100 .",
    "we therefore expect that the radiative diffusion of the heat in the radial direction will be faster than its advection in the poloidal direction .",
    "consequently , our simulations provide a dynamically consistent reason for the formation of a warm belt of accreted matter , as was suggested in the observations of @xcite and the modeling of @xcite .",
    "we have numerically simulated the structural dynamics of the bl for an accreting white dwarf surrounded by an @xmath2-disk for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "the structure and dynamics of the bl is important , because it determines the specifics of the radiated spectrum that is emitted from this region .",
    "the energy radiated from the bl could account for up to half of the total energy released in the accretion process . for high values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the bl is optically thick and extends more than 30 degrees to either side of the disk plane after 3/4 of a keplerian rotation period ( @xmath4=19s ) .",
    "the simulations also show that high values of @xmath2 result in a spreading bl which sets off gravity waves in the surface matter .",
    "the accretion rate can be high enough in the high @xmath2 cases to cause a depression to form on the surface of the star .",
    "the accretion flow moves supersonically over the depression that is formed , making it susceptible to the rapid development of gravity wave and/or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the low viscosity cases also show a spreading bl , but here the accretion flow does not set off gravity waves and it is optically thin .",
    "we argued in the paper by @xcite that an accretion belt might be sustained after a long period of perhaps thousands of dwarf nova events such that an equilibrium or steady state is established between the richardson number and the average rate of accretion .",
    "our 2d simulations in this paper has not been followed long enough for any steady state behavior to be observed .",
    "therefore , it may be premature for us on the basis of the limited extent of these first simulations to argue in favor or against the formation of an accretion belt .",
    "if the boundary layer remains optically thick following an episode of high accretion , this could explain the `` second components '' of fuv flux seen in several dwarf novae during quiescence .",
    "it should also be pointed out that a hot equatorial accretion region could persist even after the material has reached co - rotation with the white dwarf .",
    "for example , a hot ( 50,000k ) region of low rotation is seen in successive hut spectra of u gem taken early after an outburst and very late after the same outburst .",
    "the susceptibility of the flow in the boundary layer to undergo a purely hydrodynamic instability ( modified richardson number @xmath125 ) was found assuming an _ a priori _ alpha viscosity parametrization consistent with that of the disk .",
    "the unstable flow would be very effective in mixing of the accreted material with the outer layer ( few scale heights ) of the wd envelope .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the turbulent viscosity law for a non - keplerian disk can not be represented by the standard alpha viscosity prescription ( @xmath131constant ) , as alpha is proportional to the shear @xcite @xmath132 even more so , in the boundary layer , the turbulent viscosity is proportional to the square of the turbulent mach number @xmath133 @xcite , which decreases quickly for for subsonic turbulence ( supersonic turbulence quickly dissipated due to shocks ) @xmath134 supersonic radial infall in the boundary layer also leads to a smaller turbulent viscosity as shown by @xcite , and the formulation of such a viscosity can also be obtained considering causality in one - dimensional steady - state models of accretion disk boundary layers @xcite , namely the radial infall viscosity can not be larger than the maximum speed of the turbulence . in that case one has @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the radial infall mach number , and it is smaller than the turbulent mach number @xmath137 ( see also @xcite ) .    in these regions close to the stellar surface ( and even more so away from the equatorial region ) , one can use a viscosity of the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the stellar rotational velocity , @xmath140 is the velocity of the flow , and @xmath141 is the distance from the surface of the wd .",
    "it is clear that such a viscosity would decrease rapidly as @xmath142 , and would agree with the fact that the size of the turbulent eddies be limited by the presence of the stellar surface and their velocity proportional to the change of @xmath140 over a distance @xmath141 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "piro and bildsten have shown that the properties of the boundary ( `` spread '' ) layer vary depending on the value of the viscosity , however , like us , they assume an alpha viscosity in which alpha is not a function of the coordinates , the radial infall velocity or or the shear .",
    "it is our aim , in future simulations , to carry out simulation of the boundary layer , by assuming a viscosity law that is greatly reduced in the boundary layer . for this purpose",
    ", one could use a combination of viscosity prescriptions suggested in the above mentioned works .",
    "since the results presented here as well as piro & bildsten s results depend strongly on the value of @xmath2 ( which was assumed to be constant ) , it is clear that a modified alpha viscosity prescription can lead to some new and unexpected results .",
    "the evolutionary simulations presented here , while followed for only a brief interval of time , represent the first successful , fully hydrodynamic treatment of the the flow of accreted matter _ into _ the white dwarf surface layers .",
    "all previous attempts to follow accretion hydrodynamically from the boundary layer into the white dwarf surface layers were either not computationally viable or the underlying white dwarf was treated as a solid boundary .",
    "the successful convergence of our dynamical model simulations opens the door to going well beyond this first stage and ultimately follow the dynamical evolution over much longer time intervals for both the high viscosity and low viscosity cases with the inclusion of radiative processes .",
