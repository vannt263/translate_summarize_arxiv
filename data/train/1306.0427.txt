    "this feature of quantum scissors can be exploited to teleport a qudit encoded into a single photon which is shared by @xmath0 spatial modes of paraxial light . for this purpose the @xmath0-level state of the photon",
    "is _ transcribed _ into @xmath0 single - rail qubits carried by light modes propagating along different paths with the help of a mode sorter .",
    "such a device has the task to transfer orthogonal light modes within a single light beam to different optical paths , similar to a polarizing beam splitter , which conveys light with horizontal and vertical polarization to orthogonal paths .",
    "for example , consider a single - photon state @xmath17 given by an elementary excitation of a superposition of @xmath0 paraxial laguerre - gauss modes @xmath20 corresponding to different values @xmath21 of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite which co - propagate along an optical path @xmath22 , i.e , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the state of a single photon with oam @xmath21 .",
    "we spatially separate the oam modes by diverting them into different optical paths @xmath25 depending on their oam value @xmath21 with the help of an oam mode sorter @xcite .",
    "for @xmath26 this transformation reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents a single photon with oam quantum number @xmath29 in path @xmath30 and no photon in all other paths ( accordingly for the remaining terms ) .",
    "the single photon states are conveniently expressed by the creation operators @xmath31 acting on the global vacuum state @xmath32 , cp .",
    "the right - hand side of .",
    "this transformation _",
    "transcribes _ the state of a qudit into @xmath0 entangled single - rail qubits . after the transcription the @xmath33th qubit contains the quantum information about whether the corresponding oam mode @xmath34 of the photonic qudit was occupied ( @xmath35 ) or not ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "-dimensional state of a single photon , which is in a superposition of @xmath0 oam modes , is mapped by a mode sorter to @xmath0 single - rail qubits .",
    "this is followed by the teleportation of the individual single - rail qubits using @xmath0 quantum scissors .",
    "eventually , a @xmath37 phase shift ( @xmath38 ) is applied to the single - rail qubits where necessary and their composite state is transcribed back into a photonic qubit by a mixer.,width=321 ]    now each single - rail qubit can be teleported individually ( cp . fig .  ) using quantum scissors .",
    "this is accomplished as follows : each of the @xmath0 spatial modes are inserted into @xmath0 independent quantum scissors setups ( see fig .   for @xmath39 ) .",
    "there are thus @xmath0 input modes @xmath40 and @xmath0 output modes @xmath41 with @xmath42 to carry the quantum information . in addition , the quantum scissors require a total of @xmath0 single photons entered separately in modes @xmath43 . upon conditioning on the detection of a single photon in each of the quantum scissor devices ( success probability @xmath44 with ideal detectors , for non - unit detection efficiencies see methods ) the state @xmath17 carried by the input modes @xmath40",
    "is transferred to the output modes @xmath41 ( cp .",
    "methods ) : @xmath45    since the mode @xmath41 in the @xmath33th quantum scissors device originates from the reflection of mode @xmath43 both are identical except for their propagation direction , and they should carry the same oam value as input mode @xmath40 , the state of which is supposed to be transferred to @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the photon entering in mode @xmath43 should be prepared with oam value @xmath46 .    however , as shown under methods , this is not necessary if the modes @xmath41 are transformed into the appropriate oam mode after the state transfer . in fact , preparing the additional photons in a different system of basis modes enables a transcription of the quantum information stored in a specific basis ( here oam modes ) in the input modes of the quantum scissors devices to another basis ( for example hermite gaussian modes @xcite ) in its output modes .",
    "by such a transcription any unitary gate acting on the hilbert space of the qudit can be realized , however only with limited success probability which is determined by the quantum scissors involved .",
    "after successful teleportation by the quantum scissors we can convert the entangled @xmath0 single - rail qubits back to the original @xmath0-mode oam state with the help of a mixer which is a sorter run in reverse .",
    "this completes the teleportation of a photonic qudit ( cp .",
    "fig .  ) . in order to realize an additional unitary qudit - gate ( see above ) together with the teleportation",
    ", the mixer has to map the new basis modes in the outputs of the @xmath0 quantum scissors into a single beam , i.e. , it must be a reverse sorter for these particular modes , which exists for example for hermite gaussian modes @xcite .",
    "in this article we have presented a scheme to teleport a photonic qudit carried by oam modes .",
    "the scheme requires linear optical devices , oam mode sorters as well as single - photon sources and photon - number resolving detectors .",
    "the essential step is to transcribe the state of the qudit to @xmath0 single - rail qubits by means of a mode sorter and to teleport the qubits individually by quantum scissors . in",
    "as far as such sorter devices can be designed for other light modes , for example hermite - gaussian modes @xcite , the proposed teleportation scheme is universal and can be implemented with any system of basis modes . using quantum scissors",
    "a single - rail qubit can be teleported with success probability @xmath47 , therefore , the success probability to teleport @xmath0 single - rail qubits and thus the encoded qudit amounts to @xmath44 .    in principle",
    ", the probability to teleport a single - rail qubit can be increased to @xmath48 by employing @xmath49 additional entangled photons and a balanced multiport with @xmath50 inputs and outputs as described by knill et al.@xcite instead of one additional photon and a balanced beam splitter in each of the quantum scissors setups .",
    "this leads to a success probability for the qudit teleportation of @xmath51 but requires @xmath0 highly entangled @xmath49-photon states , which can be prepared probabilistically offline@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the encoding of one qudit into @xmath0 two - level systems ( such as single - rail qubits ) represents an inefficient use of storage capacity .",
    "the amount of quantum information present in a single qudit actually corresponds to @xmath52 qubit units of quantum information and could thus be stored efficiently in @xmath52 single - rail qubits .",
    "given a scheme which is able to transcribe the initial photonic qudit into @xmath52 single - rail qubits , a subsequent teleportation could be achieved by means of @xmath52 quantum scissors with a success probability of @xmath53 .",
    "this would mean an exponential decrease of the resources needed to teleport a qudit .     and",
    "two quantum scissors devices teleport the states of light of the spatially separated modes @xmath55 and @xmath54 individually to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the latter are retransferred by a mixer into a photonic qubit carried by a single output beam on the right , which is a sorter run in reverse.,width=302 ]    alternatively , using the transcription based on a oam mode sorter , as described above , the present scheme allows , instead of a single qudit , to teleport @xmath0 single - rail qubits encoded in co - propagating oam modes , with the same resources as before .",
    "this corresponds to an exponential increase of quantum information sent per use of the teleportation protocol .",
    "however , the preparation and manipulation of single - rail qubits seems problematic compared to qudits carried by single - photon states of oam modes , which can be prepared , transformed and measured with standard techniques @xcite . for single - rail qubits , general deterministic single- and two - qubit gates are not available @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vacuum component makes state tomography of single - rail qubits difficult .",
    "the present scheme has certain advantages as well as disadvantages over a recently proposed alternative teleportation method @xcite . unlike the latter , it _ does not _ require highly sensitive",
    "multipartite entangled states to perform the quantum teleportation .",
    "on the other hand , the alternative method yields a greater success probability of @xmath58 for qudit teleportation , and requires less additional photons .",
    "remarkably , it yields for the joint teleportation of the state of many photons the same maximal teleportation rate as quantum scissors for single rail qubits , namely one qubit per additional photon",
    ". however , by improving the transcription efficiency one could overcome these drawbacks of the present scheme .",
    "in the following we show that @xmath0 quantum scissors enable a transfer of the state @xmath59 obtained after the transformation to output modes @xmath60 .",
    "the state @xmath59 along with @xmath0 photons at ports @xmath43 constitute the initial state entering the @xmath0 quantum scissors ( cp .",
    "fig .   for @xmath39 )",
    "@xmath61 where we have introduced the creation operators @xmath62 to denote single photons in the modes @xmath43 .",
    "each quantum scissors device contains two @xmath63 beam splitters , cp .",
    "[ q - scissors ] .",
    "the first beam splitter bs@xmath13 of the @xmath33th device distributes the incoming photon in mode @xmath43 equally over both modes , @xmath43 and @xmath41 , represented by the transformation rule in terms of the corresponding creation operators @xmath64 .",
    "also the action of the second beam splitter bs@xmath14 in each quantum scissors device is conveniently described by similar rules : @xmath65 consecutive application of these transformations for beam splitters bs@xmath13 and bs@xmath14 for all quantum scissors @xmath33 to the initial state yields the total state change : @xmath66 the second and final step to complete the state transfer by means of quantum scissors provides a photon - number measurement in modes @xmath43 and @xmath40 conditioned on the detection of a single photon in @xmath43 and vacuum in @xmath40 , cp .",
    "[ q - scissors ] .",
    "since there are a total of @xmath67 photons in the system , a detection of one photon in each of the @xmath0 modes @xmath43 and zero photons in the modes @xmath40 results in a single photon in one of the modes @xmath41 according to photon - number conservation .",
    "the measurement projects onto those components of state @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eq-11a ] ) which allow for such a detection event : @xmath69 therefore the state of light in the output modes @xmath70 of the quantum scissors reads : @xmath71 which is the state initially carried by the input modes @xmath25 , cf .  .",
    "please note , that a teleportation of the initial state carried by the input modes @xmath40 onto different output modes @xmath72 can also be achieved : @xmath73 for this purpose , photons of modes @xmath74 corresponding to the targeted modes @xmath72 are inserted into the ports @xmath43 , together with the initial state @xmath17 in modes @xmath40 ; @xmath75 the consecutive actions of the beam splitters @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the quantum scissor devices , given respectively by @xmath78 and @xmath79 together with , transform state into @xmath80 the only components of state @xmath81 that can contribute to a coincidence detection of a single photon by the detectors @xmath15 ( cp .",
    "[ q - scissors ] ) in each of the @xmath0 quantum scissors devices are given by @xmath82 if we further assume that each detectors @xmath15 absorbs a single photon in the detection process without distinguishing between both kinds of photons @xcite , @xmath43 and @xmath74 , then the remaining state is given as claimed by @xmath83    the detection event indicating successful teleportation occurs for ideal detectors with probability @xmath84 which is obtained from a normalization factor in projection  .",
    "however , the success probability can be increased by considering other detection events .",
    "for example , if one photon is detected in mode @xmath85 instead of mode @xmath86 , as well as one photon in each of the remaining modes @xmath43 , the state of @xmath2 collapses into : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "the minus sign can be compensated by applying a @xmath37-phase shift to mode @xmath93 which causes the state change @xmath94 .",
    "hence , it does not matter whether the detectors in modes @xmath86 or @xmath85 register a single photon count as long as there is only one count in each quantum scissors setup .",
    "thus there are @xmath95 detection events corresponding to successful teleportation , which increases the probability of success to @xmath96 .",
    "the success probability of the teleportation scheme depends on the efficiencies of the detectors used with the quantum scissors . for detectors which count a single photon with probability ( i.e. , efficiency ) @xmath97",
    "the success probability of the scheme reduces to @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , a restricted detection efficiency can induce the false identification of a two - photon detection event as a single - photon count with probability @xmath99 . such a mistaken identification in one of the quantum scissor set - ups together with single",
    "photon counts in the remaining ones leads to vacuum in the output modes , while the detectors seemingly announce a successful teleportation .",
    "the probability for such false announcement equals @xmath100 and can be calculated from the probability to obtain a two - photon detection event with ideal detectors which amounts to @xmath47 , independent of the number of quantum scissor setups ( cp .",
    "eq .  ) , multiplied with the probability for a false identificaton due to the non - unit detection efficiency .",
    "therefore , the teleportation fidelity defined as the overlap between the input and the output state of the teleportation scheme decreases from @xmath101 with ideal detectors to @xmath102 for detectors with efficiency @xmath103 .    biblabel[1]#1 .    10    bennett , c.  h. _ et al . _ teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and einstein - podolsky - rosen channels . , 18951899 ( 1993 ) .",
