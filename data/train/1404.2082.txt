    "studying how photonic states that are initially entangled in terms of their transverse spatial modes loose their entanglement as they propagate through atmospheric turbulence , one finds oneself within the overlap between two fields .",
    "one is the scintillation of classical optical beams , which has been studied for several decades @xcite .",
    "the other is the currently vibrant field of quantum information science @xcite and in particular the study of open quantum systems @xcite and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the problem of entanglement decay due to atmospheric scintillation has been considered by paterson @xcite from a conventional classical optics point of view , by assuming that one can represent the turbulent atmosphere as a single phase screen .",
    "this single phase screen model is currently used as the basis for most work that is being done on the evolution of entangled photons propagating through atmospheric turbulence @xcite .",
    "however , it is by construction only valid under weak scintillation conditions .",
    "although the predictions of this approach have been shown to be consistent with experimental observations @xcite , one can rightfully ask whether this approach makes sense within the context of quantum information theory :  does it represent a valid quantum process ? more recently , a multiple phase screen model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , it is also derived using a classical optics approach and as such its validity as a quantum process also comes under question . in both these cases the density matrix that is obtained as solution represents a physical quantum state only if it has a unity trace and no negative eigenvalues .    in this paper",
    "we consider the evolution of the photonic quantum states propagating through turbulence from the perspective of quantum information theory .",
    "the aim is to develop a formalism with which one can study the decay of the transverse spatial modal entanglement of photonic states . within this context",
    "we consider both the single phase screen approach , which assumes weak scintillation , and the multiple phase screen approach , without the assumption of weak scintillation",
    ". the single phase screen process , which one can express as an operator product expansion , leads to the same integral expression found from the classical optics derivation @xcite . in the case of the multiple phase screen process",
    ", the resulting expression is in the form of a lindblad equation @xcite .",
    "the latter indicates that the formalism represents a quantum process that produces a valid density operator .",
    "we also show that this result reproduces the equation in @xcite . however , the aim here is not to rederive the infinitesimal propagation equation ( ipe ) obtained in @xcite , but to obtain an equation that represents a valid quantum process , as given by the lindblad equation .",
    "the laguerre - gaussian modes , with their discrete radial and azimuthal indices , are a popular choice for the spatial modes used in free - space quantum communication systems .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that it may be more beneficial to use a plane wave basis .",
    "the analysis that is presented here does not assume any particular set of transverse spatial modes and can be employed for any such modal basis .",
    "the main part of the derivations is done for a single photon .",
    "since a single photon can not represent an entangled quantum state , the same derivation would be valid for a classical optical field .",

    "the effect of atmospheric turbulence on an optical beam propagating through it , is introduced by fluctuations in the refractive index of the air .",
    "the refractive index of a turbulent atmosphere can be expressed as @xmath0 , where the average refractive index is approximately equal to @xmath1 and the small fluctuations are represented by @xmath2 .",
    "scintillation is the process of distortion that an optical beam experiences while propagating through a random medium , such as a turbulent atmosphere .",
    "a quantitative model for optical scintillation requires a model for the turbulence .",
    "there are a number of such models @xcite depending , among other things , on whether one includes the effects of the inner scale and the outer scale .",
    "( the inner and outer scales introduce cut - offs at high and low spatial frequencies , respectively . ) the simplest model is the kolmogorov model , which is valid in the inertial range between the inner and outer scales .",
    "the kolmogorov power spectral density of the refractive index fluctuations is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the refractive index structure constant .",
    "the strength of the turbulence is determined by @xmath4 , with values ranging from about @xmath5  m@xmath6 for weak turbulence to about @xmath7  m@xmath6 for strong turbulence .",

    "the strength of scintillation is not only determined by the strength of the turbulence , but also by the other relevant dimension parameters , namely , the distance @xmath13 over which the light propagates through turbulence and the wavelength of the light @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters are combined into the rytov variance , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wave number ( @xmath17 ) . for plane waves ,",

    "they found that the concurrence decays to zero when @xmath52 .",

    "therefore , the optical field never seems to arrive in the region of strong scintillation with nonzero entanglement , which seems to imply that the single phase screen model can be used for all situations .",
    "there are , however , some conditions under which the entanglement can survive into the region of strong scintillation , for instance , when larger values of azimuthal index are used @xcite , or when the states are optimized to retain their entanglement over larger distances @xcite . as a result , it does make sense to develop a reliable model that does not only apply in weak scintillation conditions .",
    "in the multiple phase screen approach the quantum process is broken up into multiple steps . instead of doing the calculation in one step , going from the pure initial state to the final mixed state , as was done in sec .",

    "although the single phase screen approximation is valid for each step in this situation , thanks to the short propagation distances , the fact that this operation is performed repeatedly implies that one also needs to include the free space propagation process , which is neglected in the single phase screen model . as a result",

    "the single phase screen model would not be valid anymore .",
