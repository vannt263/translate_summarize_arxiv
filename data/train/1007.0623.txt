    "since qubit decoherence results from uncontrolled evolution due to the coupling between the qubit and the bath , a natural idea to combat decoherence is to encode the qubit in a subspace immune to noises from the environment ( decoherence - free subspace  @xcite ) , which is made possible by symmetries of the interactions in certain physical systems . or alternatively , the coherence can be protected by dynamically eliminating the qubit - bath coupling during the evolution ( dynamical decoupling , referred to as dd for short ) .",

    "[ pulses ] .",
    "notice that due to the variable transformation from @xmath291 to @xmath292 , the magnetic field @xmath243 does not have the symmetries as the scaled modulation functions @xmath271 .",
    "for example , @xmath243 is not periodic and the pulse at different time has different width .",
    "obviously , the same argument holds for dd against pure dephasing just by changing the rotation axis .      in realistic experiments ,",
    "the pulses have finite durations and amplitudes , which introduces additional errors .",
    "there is a no - go theorem which states that instantaneous @xmath41-pulses can not be approximated by pulses of finite amplitude and of short duration @xmath293 with accuracy higher than the order @xmath294 without perturbing the bath evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , as we have discussed above , the symmetric requirements of @xmath295 automatically guarantee the performance of udd .",
    "uhrig and pasini showed that by appropriately designing the pulses , the qubit - bath hamiltonian describing pure dephasing can be transformed into the form  @xcite @xmath296 with the modulation function taking values from @xmath297 .",
    "the scaled modulation function @xmath298 is designed to have the symmetries required in the previous proof and therefore can be expanded by odd harmonics of @xmath299 $ ] .",

    "an arbitrarily high decoupling precision can be achieved simply by choosing a sufficiently high order of dd ( and correspondingly a sufficiently small pulse interval @xmath48 ) . in the high - fidelity regime (",
    "@xmath74 is small ) , the decoupling precision of udd scales with the number of pulses much faster than that of cdd .",

    "for the same reason ( namely , reduction of @xmath48 ) , to achieve a given order of precision , cdd indeed requires by far less than the seemingly exponential cost .",
    "+   + * case ii * : the minimum pulse interval @xmath48 is fixed , which is a frequently encountered restriction in realistic experiments . in this situation ,",
    "increasing the order of dd leads to two competing effects  @xcite .",
    "first , the qubit - bath coupling is eliminated to a higher order , which tends to increase the decoupling precision .",
    "second , the total evolution time @xmath74 increases and the bath has more time to inflict qubit decoherence . competition between these two effects leads to the existence of an optimal decoupling order , beyond which further increasing the order of dd does not improve the decoupling precision any longer . for a given minimum pulse interval @xmath48 , the optimal order of udd is  @xcite @xmath311 and that of cdd is  @xcite @xmath312 udd has a much higher optimal level than cdd for a small minimum pulse interval , and therefore the highest decoupling precision that can be achieved by udd is much higher than that by cdd .",
