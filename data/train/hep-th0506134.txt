    "we will construct an explicit rotationally invariant noncommutative space by deforming adequately the algebra .",
    "in particular we will show how to construct a gauge theory in this space by a extending the commutative - space theory written in terms of explicit rotationally invariant operators .",
    "the evident advantage is that in this formulation the equations of motion accept a spherically symmetric ansatz , resemblant to the t hooft form .",
    "moreover , we will show that in the small @xmath1 limit the solutions tends to the well - known prasad - sommerfield solutions .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we construct a rotationally invariant noncommutative space .",
    "we find that this deformation reduces to a foliation of the three - dimensional space with concentric 2-fuzzy spheres . in section 3",
    "we show how to construct gauge fields in a manner consistent with the rotationally symmetry of the space . in section 4",
    "we construct a yang - mills - higgs theory and derive the equations of motion .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the solution of the equations of motion .",
    "finally in section 6 we summarize the paper and present some discussion .",
    "one of the main problems in finding noncommutative monopole solutions is that the simplest ansatz ( t hooft ) has explicit spherical symmetry whereas the standard noncommutative space in three dimensions breaks rotational invariance . of course ,",
    "spherical symmetry is not essential for the construction of monopole solutions and in fact several non - spherically symmetric solution has been found explicitly @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however spherical symmetry greatly simplify the equations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "so in order to the take advantage of this simplification let us modify the noncommutative structure of the space in order to preserve rotational symmetry .",
    "consider a three - dimensional noncommutative space with coordinates satisfying the commutator algebra @xmath2 = i \\theta\\ , \\varepsilon_{i j k}\\ , f(r)\\ , x_k\\ ] ] with @xmath3 a function to be determined and @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown that the jacobi identity imposes the condition @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is a casimir of the algebra ) , so we have @xmath2 = i \\theta\\ , r\\ , \\varepsilon_{i j k}\\ , x_k \\label{x - algebra}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 a dimensionless parameter ( here , unlike fuzzy - sphere coordinates , the coordinates @xmath7 are all independent , there is no constraint between them ) .",
    "then the operators @xmath8 satisfy the @xmath9 algebra .",
    "being the algebra ( [ x - algebra ] ) invariant under space rotations , it is natural to extend it with angular momentum operators @xmath10 @xmath11 & = i\\ , \\varepsilon_{i j k}\\ , l_k \\nonumber\\\\ [ l_i , x_j ] & = i\\ , \\varepsilon_{i j k}\\ , x_k \\label{lx - algebra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can find a representation of ( [ x - algebra ] ) and ( [ lx - algebra ] ) by identifying the coordinate operators with @xmath12 : @xmath13 with @xmath10 , @xmath9 operators .",
    "we have that @xmath14 and if restrict ourselves to finite - dimensional representations we have @xmath15 ( in principle we allow spinor representations ) . in this representation",
    "@xmath16 is a continuos commutative variable .",
    "notice that the algebra ( [ x - algebra])-([lx - algebra ] ) , for fixed @xmath16 describes a fuzzy sphere @xcite-@xcite , so essentially what we are doing is foliating the three - dimensional noncommutative space with concentric fuzzy spheres .    since algebra ( [ x - algebra ] ) is not invariant under space translations , is imposible to define momentum operators satisfying @xmath17 & = & -i\\ , \\delta_{ij } \\label{px - algebra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these relations violate the jacobi identity for three operators @xmath18 .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that for constant non - commutative space @xmath2 = i \\theta_{ij } \\label{standardnc}\\ ] ] it is not possible to define angular momentum operators satisfying ( [ lx - algebra ] ) since the algebra ( [ standardnc ] ) is not rotationally invariant ( the jacobi identity fails for the triplet @xmath19 ) .    in order to define a field theory in this noncommutative space we first define transversal and radial field components and write the appropriate lagrangian . in commutative space ,",
    "given a vector field in cartesian coordinates @xmath20 , we can define transversal components @xmath21 and a radial component @xmath22 as @xmath23 the transversal part satisfies the constraint @xmath24 cartesian coordinates can be recovered from the transversal and radial ones through the identity @xmath25 since we are working in a non - commutative space with explicit rotational invariance ( [ x - algebra ] ) it is natural consider the transversal and radial fields ( [ transversal - fields ] ) as our primary fields and not the cartesian components @xmath26 .",
    "this is crucial because in noncommutative space there is no mapping as ( [ cartesian ] ) to define cartesian coordinates .",
    "so , a transversal field in the noncommutative space is a field that satisfies the constraint @xmath27 , or in virtue of representation ( [ xtol ] ) @xmath28 is straightforward to check that any vector field of the form @xmath29\\ ] ] is transversal .",
    "we will see that a slight modification has to be done in the case of a gauge theory .",
    "as we did for arbitrary vector fields we define transversal and radial gauge fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 in analogy with their commutative counterparts ( from now on we will drop the superscript @xmath32 in @xmath33 ) . that is @xmath34 and @xmath31 are fields that in commutative space take the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the cartesian components of the standard vector potential",

    "we want to stress again that the map ( [ transversal - gauge ] ) between spherical and cartesian coordinates is only possible in commutative space . in noncommutative space",
    "we are forced to work with spherical coordinates and we can not recover the cartesian coordinates . that is , in this space the fundamental fields are the variables @xmath34 , @xmath31 and not @xmath36 .",
    "but now we have a problem trying to impose the constraint ( [ cons0 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the constraint is not invariant under gauge transformations and thus not well defined for gauge fields . in order to define a gauge invariant transversal constraint",
    "we introduce the gauge covariant distance @xmath39 , @xmath40 as its names suggests , this quantity transforms under gauge transformations as @xmath41 so the correct gauge invariant constraint is given by @xmath42 this can be written as @xmath43 which in the limit @xmath44 coincides with ( [ cons0 ] ) .",
    "it is useful at this point to introduce the transverse covariant derivative operator @xmath45 so @xmath46 and the constraint can be written as @xmath47 ( we have defined @xmath48 ) , or @xmath49 the field strength @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined in analogy with the commutative case @xmath52 - [ l_j , a_i ] - [ a_i , a_j ] - i \\varepsilon_{ijk } a_k \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = i\\left ( [ d_i , d_j ] - i \\varepsilon_{ijk } d_k \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath53 - [ p , a_i ] - [ a_i , a_r]\\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ & = i [ d_i , d_r]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the radial covariant derivative @xmath55 for convenience we will work in the gauge @xmath56 so @xmath57 .    as usual",

    "to write an action in this geometry , we simply write the action in the commutative - space case in terms of transversal and radial fields using the definition ( [ transversal - gauge ] ) and then promote the fields to noncommutative space , respecting gauge invariance when needed . for a yang - mills and higgs actions we have , where the trace is taken over the angular momentum representation indices . ]",

    "we have to mention possible bps equations of motion . in commutative space , in terms of the radial and transversal fields , the bps equations read @xmath72 however we have been unable to construct a noncommutative version of them",
    ". the obvious modifications , replacing the coordinate @xmath73 by the covariant coordinate operator @xmath74 and the product of @xmath73 and @xmath75 by the moyal anticommutator @xmath76 , does not work .",
    "for example after this replacement equation ( [ bps-2 ] ) reads @xmath77 = \\pm \\frac{1}{2 r^2 } \\varepsilon_{i j k } \\{x^j , f_{k r } \\}\\ ] ] but while the l.h.s is transversal with respect to @xmath74 , the r.h.s is not .",
    "even projecting the r.h.s over the transverse components does not reproduce the equations of motion .",
    "the most general spherically symmetric ansatz can be written using the operators @xmath78 \\label{operators}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 are the pauli matrices and @xmath80 although ( [ operators ] ) is the most general set of rotationally covariant operators , it can be shown that the set remains consistent if we drop @xmath81 . that is , when we expand the fields in the basis @xmath82 the equations of motions does not have components in the direction @xmath81 .",
    "so , from now on we will work with the basis @xmath82",
    ".    then we expand @xmath83 with @xmath84 arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate @xmath16 , @xmath85 .",
    "the constraint ( [ consd ] ) implies the following two equations for the coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 that is , the field @xmath90 depends only on one function .",
    "we have for the field strength @xmath91 and @xmath92    to write the equation of motion we have first to solve equation to find the lagrange multiplier @xmath65 that projects the solution onto the tangential space .",
    "spherical symmetry imposes that @xmath65 has the form @xmath93 so equation ( [ trans2 ] ) leads to algebraic equations for the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "however we will see later that we can solve explicitly the constraint and thus work with the physical , unconstrained degrees of freedom , making unnecessary the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the higgs field can be expanded as @xmath96 and the covariant derivatives takes the form @xmath97 & =   -\\phi_1 \\ , ( v_0 - 2\\ , v_1 - v_2)\\ ,   v^{(3)}_i \\nonumber \\\\ [ d_r,\\phi ] & =   i\\,r\\ , \\left ( \\phi_0'(r ) + \\phi_1'(r ) \\ , \\alpha \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be checked that the equation of motion ( [ eqmot2 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "finally , the last equations , ( [ eqmot3 ] ) take the form @xmath98 notice that @xmath99 is decoupled from the other fields and in fact it is an irrelevant constant .    in these variables",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath100      let us study first the small @xmath1 expansion of the monopole equations .",
    "first we note that the operator @xmath101 is already of order @xmath102 : @xmath103 so the coefficient @xmath88 is of order @xmath104 .",
    "( since the covariant derivative operator starts with @xmath10 at zero - order the coefficient @xmath86 is order zero ) .    to compare with the usual t hofft~-polyakov~-julia~-zee prasad sommerfield solutions",
    "we write @xmath105 the constraints ( [ spher - consd-2 ] ) can be solved perturbatively in @xmath1 and we can write the coefficients of @xmath86 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath88 ( @xmath107 ) as functions of the coefficients of @xmath87 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we have @xmath109    at leading order we recover the standard monopole equations @xmath110 with the well - known solutions @xcite @xmath111 the next order equations read @xmath112 @xmath113 and can be solved numerically .      instead of working with the  linear \" variables @xmath114 and the constraints ( [ spher - consd-2 ] ) we can try to reparametrize the fields and solve the constraint explicitly .",
    "then the resulting fields are the physical degrees of freedom and the constraint is automatically incorporated in the equations of motion .",
    "in fact , we can see that the replacement @xmath115 diagonalizes the second equation ( [ spher - consd-2 ] ) @xmath116 which is straightforwardly solved in term of two functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( both are functions of @xmath16 ) @xmath119 with @xmath120 ( we chose the branch solution that matches the standard @xmath121 limit ) . replacing this solution into the first of equations ( [ spher - consd-2 ] ) we get a quadratic equation for @xmath117 that can be easily solved .",
    "finally we have a parametrization that solves the constraint @xmath122 where @xmath123 that is , we have parametrized the gauge fields in terms of only one function @xmath118 , which together with the higgs field @xmath124 are the only nontrivial degrees of freedom .",
    "the next step is to write the equations of motion in terms of them .",
    "actually , though we have reduced significantly the number of degrees of freedom , the equations of motion are very complicated in terms of these fields .",
    "we show the complete expression of the equations of motions in the appendix .    in this",
    "variables the small @xmath1 limit can be recovered through the identification @xmath125      in order to get non - singular , finite energy solutions we have to impose appropriate boundary conditions . at the origin",
    "we have the usual conditions @xmath126 at @xmath127 the situation is different from the commutative case . notice that in the presence of a potential , @xmath128 the higgs field tends asymptotically to a minimum of the potential .",
    "that is , asymptotically , @xmath99 and @xmath124 are minima of @xmath129    @xmath130    ( we have rescaled the fields so @xmath131 , consistent with the small @xmath1 expansion solution ) . besides the trivial solution @xmath132 we have the solutions @xmath133 ( these correspond to absolute minima of the potential ; there are other local minima but those will give infinite energy when integrated over the whole space ) .",
    "the first of these equations gives a nontrivial @xmath134 contribution in the @xmath44 limit so we discard it .",
    "the second one gives the correct small @xmath1 behavior so we take it as the asymptotic boundary condition : @xmath135 of course , this is valid in the presence of a potential .",
    "for vanishing coupling constant , as it happens in commutative space , we can rescale the higgs fields arbitrarily by rescaling appropriately the radial variable @xmath16 .    for the gauge field",
    "we impose , as usual , that at infinity the higgs kinetic term vanishes .",
    "this gives the behavior @xmath136      we solved numerically the equations of motion for different values of @xmath137 .",
    "we found solutions for essentially any value of @xmath138 allowed ( @xmath139 ) . as expected , for large @xmath138 ( small @xmath1 ) the solution tends to the prasad - sommerfield configurations .",
    "indeed , even for @xmath140 , the profile of the solutions are very similar to the p - s solutions . in order to see the departure of the p - s solutions we considered continuos values of @xmath138 ( which correspond to infinite dimensional representation of the non - commutative algebra ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the higgs field solution is not very sensitive to @xmath138 , even for extreme values ( @xmath141 ) . on the other hand , the gauge field in very sensitive to @xmath138 .",
    "we show in figures [ fig - u ] and [ fig - phi ] the solutions for the fields @xmath118 and @xmath124 respectively , for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "we also studied the energy of the monopole solutions as a function of @xmath1 . for small vales of @xmath1 , the energy , in units of @xmath142 ,",
    "tends to @xmath143 as expected ( bps bound ) . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", the energy also increases and diverges as @xmath104 approaches to @xmath144 .",
    "a plot of the energy as a function of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ fig - energy ] .",
    "this behavior is another hint that for @xmath1 different from zero , the solutions obtained are not self - dual , since in that case we expect the energy of the configuration to be equal to some topological number ( independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this situation can be contrasted with the case of self - dual vortex solutions in nc space . in the later , while the profile of the solutions are dependent of the noncommutative parameter , the energy is @xmath1-independent and in particular equal to @xmath143 ( in appropriate units ) , the bogomolny energy bound @xcite .",
    "( normalized to @xmath143 at infinity ) for different values of @xmath145 .",

    "previous analysis of monopole configuration in noncommutative space were done using the standard non - commutative relations @xmath0 = i \\,\\theta_{ij } \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\theta_{ij } : \\text{constant } \\label{summ-1}\\ ] ] although this algebra is invariant under space translations , as is immediate from the definition , commutation relations are not invariant under space rotations .",
    "in particular we can not benefit from the simplifications , in structure and in number of degrees of freedom , that a spherically symmetric ansatz produce .",
    "in contrast to relations , we can construct a different noncommutative algebra which is manifestly rotationally invariant @xmath2 = i \\theta\\ , r\\ , \\varepsilon_{i j k}\\ , x_k \\label{summ-2}\\ ] ] but at the expense of loosing translational invariance .",
    "in fact , the algebra is incompatible with a momentum operator @xmath151 generating infinitesimal translations .",
    "however , this is not an impediment to construct a field theory in this geometry .",
    "a representation of this algebra can be constructed by identifying @xmath152 . in this representation the value",
    "@xmath1 labels the representation through the relation @xmath153 .",
    "so , although @xmath1 can take any positive value , for the special case @xmath154 , we have finite - dimensional representations ( notice however that the radial variable @xmath16 takes continuous values ) .    in commutative space",
    ", a poincar invariant lagrangian can be written in terms of momentum operators @xmath151,where translational invariance is manifest , or in terms of angular momentum operators @xmath10 ( together with a radial scaling operator @xmath155 ) , where rotational invariance is obvious . to construct a ncft with the algebra one",
    "choose the former and promote the variables ( with some prescribed order ) to noncommutative operators .",
    "analogously , to construct a ncft with the algebra , we can choose the later and again , promote the variables to noncommutative operators .",
    "in particular we constructed a yang - mills higgs hamiltonian in this space , and also derived the equations of motions .",
    "a puzzling aspect is that we were unable to derive first order ( bps ) equations of motion .",
    "though we do not have a rigorous proof of this statement , there are several hints that suggest this property . since the theory is manifestly invariant under rotations we tried a spherically symmetric ansatz , which is nothing but a noncommutative extension of the t hooft monopole ansatz .",
    "then , as it happens in the commutative case , the number of degrees of freedom is reduced to just two , one for the gauge field and other for the higgs field .",
    "the final equations of motion are very complicated in form but not difficult to solve numerically .",
    "moreover , we showed that in the limit @xmath44 the equations of motion ( and in fact the whole hamiltonian ) , reduces to the standard commutative yang - mills - higgs theory , allowing then a perturbative solution in the noncommutative parameter .",
    "another characteristic of this theory is that it blows up at @xmath156 , which incidentally is the maximum value of @xmath1 for which there is a finite - dimensional representation of the algebra .",
    "we solved numerically the euler equations of motion for different values of @xmath157 .",
    "as expected for small values of @xmath157 the solutions is indistinguishable from the exact prasad - sommerfield solution .",
    "as we increase the value of @xmath157 the profile of the solution depart from the p - s solutions , and also the energy increases .",
    "in particular the energy diverges as @xmath157 approaches to its maximum value @xmath156 .",
