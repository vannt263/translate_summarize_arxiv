    "this is to be contrasted to the `` standard '' picture with the gluon and electroweak gauge bosons propagating in the _ same _ bulk .",
    "in this picture , due to power - law evolution ( which is _ equally _ important for both gauge couplings ) , it is possible that the two _ effective _",

    "whereas , with @xmath78 , as discussed above , the _ fundamental _ dimension_less _ qcd and electroweak gauge couplings can `` unify '' at the cut - off , even though the _ effective _ @xmath4 gauge couplings do not .",
    "there are two cases within this type of model which we now discuss .      in this case , there are no kk excitations of the top quark and hence eq . ( [ tuniv ] ) gives @xmath87 which is the @xmath35 lower limit on @xmath0 : this also depends weakly on @xmath34 .",

    "in other words , this case is intermediate between the case in section [ universal ] , where the contribution from top quark is dominant and the case in section [ subspace1 ] , where there is only the @xmath12 and higgs contribution .",
    "also , in this case , the additional contribution to hadronic @xmath91 decays ( relative to sm ) is given by @xmath107 since only kk excitations of @xmath12 with momentum in the @xmath108 extra dimensions in which quarks do not propagate contribute . from eq .",

    "the direct lower bound on @xmath26 will be ( slightly ) larger for @xmath114 since there will be more kk modes at the lowest level , i.e. , with @xmath115 .",
    "the kk states of electroweak gauge bosons with momentum in the @xmath108 extra dimensions ( in which quarks do not propagate ) couple to zero - mode quarks ( with the same strength as in sm ) , but not to zero - mode leptons .",
    "thus , at hadron colliders , the signatures of these kk states will be similar to that of @xmath116 and @xmath117 decaying to dijets .",
    "the cdf search excludes hadronic decays of @xmath116 in the mass range @xmath118 gev at @xmath119 confidence level @xcite . for the kk states of @xmath12 ,",
    "the branching ratio to quarks is slightly larger than that for @xmath116 since the leptonic decays are absent .",
    "also , since there are @xmath120 relevant states at the lowest kk level ( i.e. , with @xmath115 ) , the production cross - section can be larger than that for @xmath116 of same mass .",
    "we will assume the limit @xmath121 gev from a combination of the heavy stable quark and @xmath116 searches .    in turn",
    ", this implies that @xmath122 to give @xmath22 ( see eq .",

    ", we get @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a factor of @xmath126 which includes two effects as follows .",
    "one effect is from the loop integral .",
    "the reason is that in the case of sm electroweak correction there is only one heavy particle in the loop ( @xmath12 ) whereas in the case of the kk contribution both the particles in the loop ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) are heavy .",
    "hence the ratio of the contribution from a kk state of mass @xmath138 to the sm electroweak contribution is not simply the ratio of heaviest masses in the loop ,",
    "i.e. , it is @xmath139 _ only _ up to a factor of @xmath126 . in principle",
    ", @xmath135 can be computed in the effective @xmath4 theory . however , we see from eq .",
    "( [ amukk2 ] ) that this factor can be absorbed into the definition of the cut - off @xmath76 .",
    "the other effect included in the factor @xmath135 is that @xmath140 includes the @xmath12 and @xmath13 loop contributions in the sm , whereas @xmath11 includes loop contributions from kk states of @xmath12 , @xmath13 _ and _ the photon .",
    "there is an upper limit on @xmath141 from the condition that the effective @xmath4 theory at the cut - off @xmath76 remain perturbative .",
    "the loop expansion parameter at the cut - off @xmath76 is given by @xmath142 .",
    "here @xmath143 is the number of `` colors '' and @xmath144 is the number of kk states lighter than @xmath76 , i.e , the total number of kk states in the effective @xmath4 theory .",
    "we can not trust perturbative calculations if this factor is larger than @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we impose the constraint @xmath146 ( qcd effective coupling is smaller since number of kk states of gluons and quarks is smaller ) .",
    "thus , the upper limit on @xmath76 is not much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "nonetheless , we have checked if @xmath147 ( i.e. , @xmath76 is close to the upper limit of eq .",
    "( [ pertconstraint ] ) ) , then the sum over kk states can _ still _ be approximated by an integral .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ amukk2 ] ) in terms of @xmath148 ( using @xmath149 ) as follows : @xmath150 in fig .",

    "= 0.6    [ mmmplot ]    we now discuss the values of @xmath70 for which the constraints from @xmath0 and hadronic @xmath91 decays can be satisfied .    since @xmath158 for @xmath159 , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ b3b ] ) that if @xmath160 , then @xmath161 provided @xmath162 gev .",
    "thus , it is possible to ( barely ) satisfy the constraint from hadronic @xmath91 decays by choosing @xmath163 .    for given values of @xmath21 and @xmath70 , in general , it should be possible to choose the value of @xmath34 such that @xmath164 ( see eq .",
    "( [ t3b ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ tconstraint ] ) ) .",
    ", then the results in fig .",
    "[ mmmplot ] really correspond to a `` redefined '' value of @xmath148 ( or in other words , the cut - off @xmath76 ) .",
    "then , the cut - off appearing in the sum over kk states in eq .",
    "( [ t3b ] ) is , strictly speaking , different than that in fig .",
    "[ mmmplot ] .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ mmmplot ] the value of @xmath34 which gives @xmath164 is modified . however , the two values of cut - off and hence the two values of @xmath34 differ by a factor of at most @xmath126 . ]",
    "note that a small non - zero value of @xmath0 is allowed ( at @xmath35 level , @xmath165 as mentioned before ) and similarly the constraint from hadronic @xmath91 decays is also not very precise .",
    "thus , for given values of other parameters , there can be a _ range _ of values of @xmath70 and @xmath34 which is consistent with @xmath0 and with hadronic @xmath91 decays .",
    "next , we discuss the constraints from measurements of @xmath166 .",
    "the semileptonic decay is not affected by the kk states of @xmath12 since these states do not couple to ( zero - mode ) leptons .",
    "the amplitude for the process @xmath1 gets a contribution from kk states of @xmath12 @xmath167 ( the factor of @xmath168 reflects gim cancelation ) .",
    "this is to be compared to the sm contribution @xmath169 : the ratio is @xmath170 .",
    "thus , even if eq .",
    "( [ amuconstraint ] ) is satisfied , i.e. , the kk contribution to @xmath171 is comparable to the sm electroweak correction , the @xmath136 contribution to @xmath1 is smaller than in the sm .",
    "this is due to ( a ) an additional suppression by a factor of @xmath172 ( since @xmath173 gev ) in the case of @xmath1 ( as compared to @xmath171 ) and ( b ) @xmath174 .",
    "however , there is a larger contribution to the amplitude for @xmath1 from loops with kk states of charged would - be - goldstone boson ( wgb ) as follows . with only one higgs doublet , the _ zero - mode _",
    "charged wgb is unphysical since it becomes the longitudinal component of @xmath12 .",
    "however , the _ excited ( kk ) _ states of charged wgb _ are _ physical and have masses @xmath175 ( assuming @xmath176 ) .",
    "the coupling of the kk states of charged wgb to right - handed top quark is the same as for the zero - mode charged wgb ( i.e. , longitudinal @xmath12 ) and is @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the loop diagram with kk states of charged wgb and top quark gives an amplitude for @xmath1 given by @xmath178 . the ratio of this contribution to the sm amplitude is @xmath179 and is clearly larger than the @xmath136 contribution .",
    "moreover , if eq .",
    "( [ amuconstraint ] ) is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath22 , then this additional amplitude for @xmath1 is also comparable to the sm amplitude .",
    "such a large contribution to the process @xmath1 is not allowed since the sm prediction for the rate agrees with experiment to within @xmath94 ( combining theory and experiment @xmath95 errors ) .",
    "thus , with one higgs doublet ( and assuming no other new physics contributions to @xmath1 ) , we see that the constraint from @xmath180 rules out the possibility that the contribution to the mmm from kk states of electroweak gauge bosons is comparable to the sm electroweak correction .",
    "however , if the higgs sector is _ non - minimal _ , then the contribution of kk states of charged higgs to the process @xmath1 is modified .",
    "for example , in the @xmath181-higgs - doublet model ( model - ii ) @xcite , a cancelation occurs between the contribution of kk states of _ physical _ charged higgs and the contribution of the kk states of the charged wgb mentioned above .",
    "this opens up the possibility that @xmath22 .",
    "note that the loop contribution to @xmath171 from kk states of charged higgs is negligible in this model since it is suppressed by additional powers of @xmath182 compared to the contribution due to kk states of @xmath12 .",
    "in summary , we have revisited the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( mmm ) in models with flat extra dimensions of size @xmath2 tev@xmath3 accessible to the sm particles . in particular",
    ", we analyzed a model with colored particles ( quarks and gluon ) propagating in a sub - space of the bulk in which non - colored particles ( leptons , higgs and electroweak gauge bosons ) propagate .",
    "in such a model , the constraints on the size of the extra dimensions from tree - level processes and the @xmath0 parameter ( which have been analyzed previously ) can be evaded .",
    "thus , in this model the contribution to the mmm from the kk states of electroweak gauge bosons can be ( potentially ) comparable to the sm electroweak correction ( unlike in other types of models ) .",
    "however , with only one higgs doublet , once the constraint from contribution of kk states to the process @xmath1 ( which has _ not _ been considered before ) is imposed , we have shown that such a large contribution to the mmm is not possible .",
    "the @xmath1 constraint can be relaxed in models with more than one higgs doublet and then a large contribution to the mmm becomes possible .",
