    "many of the modern approaches extending the standard model include the hypothesis of multidimensionality of the space - time ( e.g. kaluza - klein type theories , supergravity , superstring theory ; see for instance @xcite and @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the extra dimensions are supposed to be compactified , i.e. `` curled up '' to a compact manifold of a characteristic scale @xmath3 .",
    "various aspects of multidimensional models of gravity and particle interactions at the classical level have been intensively studied ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite for reviews ) . some issues related to quantum features of kaluza - klein theories were considered in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting problems is the search and calculation of characteristic effects related to multidimensional nature of kaluza - klein theories . in this paper",
    "we consider one of the effects of this kind , which is essentially quantum .    in many models",
    "the scale of compactification @xmath3 is assumed to be ( or appears to be ) of the order of the inverse planck mass @xmath4 ( see , for example , @xcite and the reviews @xcite ) . in this case",
    "additional dimensions could reveal themselves only as peculiar gravitational effects or at an early stage of the evolution of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some arguments in favour of a larger compactification scale .",
    "one of them comes from kaluza - klein cosmology and stems from the fact that the density of heavy kaluza - klein particles can not be too large , in order not to exceed the critical density of the universe .",
    "estimates obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite give the bound @xmath5 gev .",
    "other arguments are related to results of papers @xcite and @xcite . in many of the above mentioned theories",
    "there is usually a much lower supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6 .",
    "this scale can be naturally related to the compactification scale since , as it is known , supersymmetry in principle lowers under compactification of a part of the space - time dimensions @xcite . also , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite relating these two scales may lead to cancellation of unwanted threshold corrections in superstring theories for certain compactifications . in its turn multidimensional models , because of their non - renormalizability , apparently should be considered as some kind of low energy effective theory stemming from more fundamental theory , like supersting theory .",
    "this gives additional motivations for considering kaluza - klein models with @xmath7 .",
    "no natural mechanism providing compactification of the space of extra dimensions with such scale is known so far . in the present paper ",
    "having the above mentioned arguments in mind ",
    "we would like to study physical consequences in a multidimensional model assuming that a compactification of this kind is indeed possible .",
    "our aim is to find an effect which ( in principle ) could be measured experimentally and that , because of the hypothesis made that @xmath0 is of the order of a few tev , could actually be observed at future experiments in supercolliders .",
    "this could yield decisive evidence about the validity of the kaluza - klein hypothesis within a given model . in performing such analysis",
    ", we must start by understanding what kind of effects can be observed and how they depend on the topology of the space of extra dimensions in general , rather than on the phenomenological details of the given model .",
    "that is why we will here restrict ourselves to a simple @xmath8 scalar model with two extra dimensions .",
    "as is well known , by doing mode expansion , a multidimensional model on the space - time @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is a compact manifold ) can be represented as an effective theory on @xmath11 with an infinite set of particles , which is often referred to as the kaluza - klein tower of particles or modes .",
    "the spectrum of the four - dimensional theory depends on the topology and geometry of @xmath10 .",
    "the sector of the lowest state ( of the zero mode ) describes light particles ( in the sense that their masses do not depend on @xmath0 ) and coincides with the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "higher modes correspond to heavy particles with masses @xmath12 called _ pyrgons _",
    "( from the greek @xmath13 , for ladder ) .",
    "it is the contribution of pyrgons to physical quantities that might give evidence about the existence of extra dimensions .    because of its multidimensional character , the complete theory is non - renormalizable . as we have mentioned before ,",
    "this can be understood as not being a basic difficulty if the theory is a low - energy limit of some more fundamental one .",
    "whereas in a complete finite quantum theory renormalization counterterms of the low energy limit could be calculated , in the effective non - renormalizable theory , we are discussing here , the corresponding coupling constants must be considered as _",
    "phenomenological _ ones .",
    "fortunately , the contribution of these counterterms to the finite part of the amplitude is of order @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the energy of the colliding particles , @xmath16 can be regarded as the characteristic scale of the complete theory ( @xmath17 in the case of superstrings ) , and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , when @xmath19 these contributions can be neglected .    as was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , in spite of the infinite number of fields in the theory on @xmath11 and related to this non - renormalizability the contributions of the heavy particles to the renormalized quantities decouple when the energy of the process is small enough so that @xmath20 .",
    "this ensures that the low - energy limit of a kaluza - klein model is just the dimensionally reduced theory including zero modes only . when energies are comparable to @xmath0 , the contributions of the heavy modes are not negligible .",
    "one may expect that , because of the infinite number of states in the kaluza - klein tower , some accumulation of contributions of heavy modes takes place , which leads to a noticeable effect even for energies @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the mass of the first heavy mode ) , when direct production of the excited states is still not possible .",
    "of course , because of the decoupling , actually only a few of the lowest states ( with masses up to about @xmath23 ) will contribute essentially at these energies .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to demonstrate that a noticeable effect does indeed appear . with this aim",
    ", we will choose a simple scalar @xmath8-model on the six - dimensional space - time @xmath24 .",
    "the space of extra dimensions is the two - dimensional sphere @xmath25 of radius @xmath3 and with an @xmath26-invariant metric on it .",
    "study of quantum effects on the spheres ( mainly calculation of the casimir effect and the effective potential ) can be found , for example , in @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the total cross section for the  ( 2 _ light particles _ ) @xmath27  ( 2 _ light particles _ )  scattering process .",
    "pyrgons do not contribute at tree level in this model .",
    "actually , the discussion given in sect .",
    "2 shows that this statement is rather general .",
    "thus , the 1-loop correction is important for having the effect due to presence of heavy kaluza - klein modes .",
    "we will calculate the 1-loop contribution and analyze it in a wide range of energies of the scattering particles . a similar problem",
    "but for the torus compactification ( i.e. when the space of extra dimensions @xmath10 is the two - dimensional torus @xmath28 ) was considered in ref .",
    "we will use the results of that paper to compare with the results obtained in the present one , in order to understand to which extent the cross section may depend on the topology of the space of extra dimensions .",
    "we believe that our results are rather generic , and that comparable effects could be detected in more realistic theories constructed in the framework of the kaluza - klein approach .",
    "we would like to mention that some results on calculation of 1-loop feynman diagrams on the space - time @xmath29 can be found in @xcite .",
    "an alternative attitude was taken in ref .",
    "there the authors used the results of high energy experiments to get an upper bound on the size @xmath3 of the space of extra dimensions , assuming that even the first heavy kaluza - klein mode is not observed experimentally .",
    "our philosophy in the present paper is different : we assume that @xmath30 tev and look for possible experimental evidence of heavy kaluza - klein modes .",
    "it is clear that our results can be also used for obtaining bounds on @xmath3 , provided that no experimental evidence of extra dimensions is seen in future experiments for this range of energies .",
    "the paper also contains a section of more mathematical character , in which some zeta function regularization techniques @xcite are described that provide a rather elegant way of treating sums over kaluza - klein modes which appear in the theory ( for a review of these methods see @xcite ) .",
    "though there is some literature on the technique of performing calculations on the spheres ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , we think that this part of our work is interesting in its own right , since some of the formulas that appear there are brand new and provide a non - trivial , alternative way of to deal with spherical compactification .",
    "some general results on calculations on curved space - time can be found in the review @xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the model , choose the renormalization condition and discuss the general structure of the 1-loop results . in sect .",
    "3 , some useful asymptotic expansions of the corresponding ( regularizing ) zeta function are derived .",
    "methods for the numerical evaluation of the 1-loop contribution are devised and the amplitude and cross section for a wide range of energies is calculated .",
    "4 contains the analysis of the total cross section in the multidimensional model , and its comparison with the cross section for theories with a finite number of heavy particles , as well as with the cross section obtained for the torus compactification .",

    "this property is rather general and is valid for all processes of the type  ( @xmath65 _ light particles _ )  @xmath27  ( @xmath66 _ light particles _ )  at least for all scalar multidimensional theories with polynomial interactions .",
    "the reason for this is rather simple .",
    "suppose that we have a theory on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a compact space , with a polynomial interaction .",
    "the analysis of tree graphs shows that in order to obtain a contribution of heavy modes at the tree level , one needs to have at least one vertex at which @xmath67 light modes @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) interact with one heavy mode @xmath71 , where the generalized index @xmath72 corresponds to a non - zero eigenvalue of the laplace operator on @xmath10 . after substituting the expansion of the multidimensional field over the eigenfunctions of this operator ( analogous to ( [ eq : expansion ] ) ) into the original multidimensional action , the interaction term @xmath73 corresponding to this vertex",
    ", will always appear multiplied by a factor @xmath74 but since the eigenfunction @xmath75 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the laplace operator on the compact manifold is a constant , the above integral will always be zero , due to the orthonormality condition .",

    "@xmath76 the feature discussed here is a manifestation of the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "let us analyze now the 1-loop correction in our model .",
    "it is easy to check that , owing to the infinite sum of diagrams ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the green function to one loop order is quadratically divergent .",
    "this is certainly a reflection of the fact that the original theory is actually six - dimensional and , therefore , non - renormalizable .",
    "thus , the divergencies can not be removed by renormalization of the coupling constant in ( [ eq : action1 ] ) alone .",
    "we must also add a counterterm @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the dalambertian on @xmath79 and @xmath80 has mass dimension two .",

    "our calculations suggest that , indeed , the effect can be quite noticeable , even for energies below the threshold of the first heavy particle ( see fig .",
    "the values of the parameters ( [ eq : param ] ) that we have used for our computations can mimic a physical situation with , for example , @xmath261 gev and @xmath262 tev , and with the charge @xmath103 renormalized at the low energy point @xmath263 gev .    our results also show that we can distinguish between different types of compactification of the extra dimensions . the main contribution , for energies below the threshold of the first heavy mass state ,",
    "is basically determined by the zeta - function @xmath264 , uniquely associated to the two - dimensional manifold @xmath10 through the spectrum of the laplace operator on it .",
    "this provides , by the way , a further example of the relevance of the concept of zeta function in high - energy physics .",
    "of course , one should not forget that the effect studied here is of one - loop order and , apparently , rather hard to detect experimentally . because of this , an interesting possibility in a more realistic model would be to consider specific processes for which the tree approximation is absent and the leading contribution is given by the one - loop diagrams even in the zero - mode sector of the theory .",
