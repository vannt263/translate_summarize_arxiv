    "in advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) the accreting gas flows inward much more rapidly than it can cool .",
    "the energy released by accretion goes into heating the gas .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the usual thin accretion disk , where the radial velocity is small and the accretion energy is efficiently radiated away . if a black hole accretes via an adaf much of the accretion energy can be carried across the horizon with the heated gas , reducing the luminosity well below that of a comparable thin disk .",
    "paper i briefly summarizes the development of advection - dominated disk theory . over the past few years ,",
    "this theory has had notable success in reproducing the observed spectra of black hole candidate systems . for a review of the theory and applications of advection - dominated disk theory ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "early models of advection - dominated flows around black holes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) did not include a proper treatment of relativistic effects , but instead used an approximate pseudo - newtonian potential due to @xcite .",
    "close to the black hole event horizon , the gas temperatures and velocities can become extremely high .",
    "this hot , rapidly rotating and infalling gas should produce important observable effects in the high - energy spectra of black hole candidates .",
    "relativistic effects not accounted for by the pseudo - newtonian potential are dominant in this innermost region .",
    "the character of the inner portion of the disk also depends strongly on the black hole spin @xmath0 , which is not included in the pseudo - newtonian treatment . for these reasons",
    ", it seems clear that a fully relativistic model is needed .",
    "recently , advection - dominated disk models have begun to include the effects of general relativity , allowing a more accurate examination of the flow close to the event horizon .",
    "both @xcite ( agcl ) and @xcite ( pa ) have presented disk solutions in the kerr metric . in paper",
    "i , we wrote down a set of disk equations in the kerr metric , and showed a few example solutions .",
    "our relativistic disk equations differ in a number of respects from those of acgl and pa .",
    "these differences are described in detail in paper i. the main differences with acgl are that we use a causal stress and include the relativistic enthalpy .",
    "pa also include these effects , although they use a more simplified prescription to enforce causality .",
    "unlike pa , who use a polytropic equation of state , we solve the energy equation assuming that a constant fraction of the dissipated energy gets advected with the gas .",
    "also , unlike acgl and pa , we use the height prescription of @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the structure of our numerical solutions for steady state flow onto a kerr black hole in detail . in particular",
    ", we explore the effects of changing the dimensionless black hole spin @xmath0 , the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , the advected fraction of the dissipated energy @xmath3 , and the adiabatic index @xmath9 ( acgl have shown solutions for three values of @xmath0 , while pa presented a more extensive set of solutions for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "we show that there is an equilibrium spin rate for black holes accreting via adafs , above which the black hole will be spun down by accretion .",
    "we also show that there is a pressure maximum in the vicinity of the last stable orbit for low @xmath2 solutions ( cf .",
    "finally we show that the bernoulli parameter can be positive in some regions of the flow , which at least suggests the possibility of a pressure - driven outflow .    to familiarize readers with our notation",
    ", we summarize our relativistic disk equations and method of solution in  2 . in  3 we examine the dependence of our disk solutions on @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 .",
    " 4 demonstrates that there is an equilibrium spin rate for black holes accreting from adafs .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  5 .",
    "we use a relativistic version of the slim disk equations first introduced by @xcite and @xcite to study the structure of advection - dominated accretion disks .",
    "the equations are presented in detail in paper i , but for the reader s convenience we summarize them here .",
    "the units are such that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "we begin with the continuity equation : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the boyer - lindquist radius , @xmath14 is the rest mass density , @xmath15 is the relative disk thickness , @xmath16 is the radial velocity measured in a corotating frame , @xmath17 is a relativistic correction factor , and @xmath18 is the rest mass accretion rate .",
    "the gas energy equation is @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the internal energy per unit proper volume , @xmath21 is a dimensionless temperature such that the pressure @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the dissipation function , and @xmath24 is a parameter used to mock up the effects of cooling , if any . the dissipation function @xmath23 is given in paper i ( eq . ( 68 ) and appendix a ) .",
    "we also take @xmath25 which is a good approximation to the exact relativistic equation of state for an ideal relativistic boltzmann gas ( see @xcite ) when @xmath26 . because the accretion flow is assumed to consist of a mixture of magnetic fields and ionized plasma",
    ", @xmath9 can be smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "the radial momentum equation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 the @xmath30 term combines the effects of gravity and rotation , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the angular velocity , and @xmath34 . the radial acceleration , on the left - hand side ,",
    "is given by the difference between @xmath30 and the pressure gradient force , where @xmath35 is the relativistic enthalpy @xmath36 .",
    "the angular momentum conservation equation is @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the specific angular momentum of the accreting gas , @xmath39 is the angular momentum accretion rate per unit rest mass accreted .",
    "the remaining term gives the viscous angular momentum transport rate , where @xmath40 is the viscous stress .",
    "notice that we solve for @xmath41 as an eigenvalue , as do nkh and acgl .",
    "pa prespecify @xmath41 ( which they label @xmath42 ) and iterate in @xmath41 when they want to find a solution with a specified value of @xmath38 at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "@xcite also prespecifies @xmath41 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath40 is rather lengthy , and the reader is referred to  4 of paper i for a full mathematical discussion . to briefly summarize the relevant physics , we begin by calculating the shear rate @xmath43 in the local rest frame of the accreting gas",
    "this gives a complicated expression which is closely approximated by the thin disk shear rate derived by @xcite , @xmath44 ( see the appendix of paper i for a discussion ) .",
    "next we specify the relation between the turbulent shear stress and the shear rate ( rate of strain ) .",
    "the simplest prescription is the usual navier - stokes form in which stress is simply proportional to rate of strain .",
    "as is well known , the resulting system of equations is acausal . to preserve causality",
    ", we use a relativistic version of a prescription that originated with @xcite and cattaneo ( 1948 , 1958 ) and was discussed in the context of accretion disk theory by @xcite ( @xcite give a mathematically equivalent formulation ) .",
    "this modification limits the propagation of viscous effects to a finite speed @xmath45 , which we take to be @xmath46 ( our solutions are not sensitive to the precise value of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the viscous stress @xmath47 is then obtained by transforming back from the local rest frame to the boyer - lindquist frame .",
    "the equation of vertical mechanical equilibrium is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an effective vertical frequency .",
    "we adopt the expression derived by @xcite for @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the `` energy at infinity '' , which is conserved along geodesics .",
    "finally , the inward flux of mass - energy is @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the viscous stress tensor .",
    "we do not use this equation to find our solution .",
    "but when @xmath54 , @xmath55 is constant with @xmath13 , and @xmath56 , because @xmath57 at large @xmath13 . in this case equation ( [ edot ] ) is a check on our numerical accuracy .",
    "it is generally satisfied to better than one part in @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , however , @xmath55 is not conserved , since some of the rest - mass is radiated away .",
    "recall that @xmath55 at the horizon , and not @xmath60 , is the true rate of change of the mass of the black hole .",
    "we set the outer edge of the adaf at @xmath61 schwarzschild radii , or @xmath62 , and the inner edge just outside the event horizon at @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .    at the outer edge",
    "we impose two boundary conditions : @xmath65 and @xmath66 must equal their values in the self - similar advection - dominated solution of @xcite .",
    "we have also obtained solutions with the thin disk values for @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the outer edge , but our solutions adjust to the self - similar profile within a short distance of the boundary .",
    "nkh found a similar result , since their equations are essentially equivalent to ours in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "thus the self - similar solution is the `` natural '' state of the flow far from the black hole , and is an appropriate outer boundary condition .",
    "two other conditions on the flow are provided by the requirement that the flow pass smoothly through two critical points .",
    "the first is the sonic point @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the second is the `` viscous point '' @xmath69 associated with the finite propagation speed of viscous effects , where @xmath70 . associated with each critical point",
    "are two conditions that must be satisfied for a smooth flow , as well as one degree of freedom , the location of the critical point itself .",
    "the final boundary condition normalizes the density ( the density appears in the basic equations only in the form @xmath71 ) . for simplicity we set the normalization constant so that @xmath72 .",
    "we now have all the boundary conditions required to solve the four first - order ordinary differential equations for @xmath73 and @xmath21 , and to find the eigenvalue @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , consistent with causality , no boundary conditions are applied at the event horizon .",
    "we solve the system of equations listed above using a relaxation method .",
    "we solve for the structure of the flow in three radial regions : the subsonic , `` sub - viscous '' outer zone , where @xmath74 , the subsonic , `` super - viscous '' middle zone , where @xmath75 , and the supersonic , `` super - viscous '' inner zone , where @xmath76 .",
    "we first solve the outer zone for a specified value of @xmath69 , and then solve the middle zone for the same @xmath69 .",
    "we compare the outer and middle zone solutions to see whether they match up at @xmath69 ; if not , we change @xmath69 and repeat the procedure until the outer and middle solutions match up .",
    "then , using the variable values from the middle solution at @xmath67 as boundary conditions , we solve for the inner zone .",
    "as is well known , our independent variable , the boyer - lindquist @xmath13 , is ill - behaved near the horizon when @xmath77 .",
    "this might raise some concerns about the numerical accuracy of our solutions .",
    "we have taken several steps to control for this , however .",
    "first , we use a fixed number of grid points in each radial region . as @xmath78 ,",
    "the sonic radius moves sharply inward , and this greatly increases our numerical resolution close to the horizon .",
    "second , we have convergence - tested our solutions by increasing the number of grid points .",
    "no significant changes were found at increased resolution . finally , notice that conditions close to the horizon do not influence the solutions at larger radius because our fundamental equations are causal : the solution in the inner region is obtained by integrating inward from the sonic point .",
    "in fact , many of the important parameters of the flow , such as the angular momentum accretion rate @xmath41 , are fixed by conditions at and outside the sonic point .",
    "here we describe the changes in our solutions that result from changes in four basic parameters : the black hole spin @xmath0 , the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , the advected fraction of the dissipated energy @xmath3 , and the adiabatic index @xmath4 .",
    "we begin from a base solution with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( which corresponds to equipartition between gas and magnetic pressure ) .",
    "this solution was described in detail in paper i , and it appears in each of the sets of solutions described below .",
    "recall that physical units may be recovered as follows : radial velocity is @xmath83 , angular momentum is @xmath84 , density is @xmath85 ( since the mass accretion rate is set to 1 ) , and temperature is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath88 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "it is worth pointing out immediately that the marginally stable orbit plays no special role in many of our solutions .",
    "while the sonic point @xmath67 often lies close to the radius of the marginally stable orbit , there is no abrupt change in the character of the flow there .",
    "this is because pressure gradients play an important role in the radial structure of adafs ; unlike thin disks , adafs are not in centrifugal balance .",
    "we begin by examining the dependence of the accretion flow on the black hole spin parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we solve for values in the range @xmath89 , allowing for the possibility of a counterrotating hole .",
    "the horizon lies at @xmath90 , i.e. at @xmath91 for @xmath92 and at @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting profiles of @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath95 , @xmath38 , @xmath21 , and @xmath96 are shown in figure 1 for solutions with @xmath97 , -0.9 , -0.5 , 0 , 0.5 , 0.9 , and 0.999 .",
    "notice that changes in @xmath0 have little effect far from the hole .",
    "also , notice that in general the positive-@xmath0 solutions differ from the @xmath79 solution more than the corresponding negative-@xmath0 solutions .",
    "this is especially dramatic in @xmath14 and @xmath21 : the @xmath98 solution reaches very high density and temperature near the horizon , while the @xmath97 solution has @xmath14 and @xmath21 at the horizon similar to the @xmath79 solution .",
    "the positive and negative-@xmath0 solutions also show very different @xmath16 profiles close to the hole .",
    "the positive-@xmath0 solutions accelerate rapidly and plunge into the hole , while the negative-@xmath0 solutions accelerate rapidly farther from the hole and only gradually near the hole , coasting across the horizon .",
    "figure 1 also shows the positions of the sonic and viscous points for each solution .",
    "the sonic and viscous points move to smaller @xmath13 as @xmath0 increases , as expected since the `` plunge '' toward the hole occurs at smaller radii . at @xmath79 ,",
    "the sonic point is at @xmath99 , close to the last stable orbit . at @xmath98",
    ", it has moved in to @xmath100 , while for @xmath97 it moves out to @xmath101 .",
    "the viscous point always lies much farther from the hole ; in general @xmath102 .",
    "this is due to our setting @xmath103 , so that for @xmath80 we have @xmath104 .",
    "the value of @xmath95 at the horizon should be equal to @xmath105 ( denoted by a dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) due to the effects of frame - dragging .",
    "this results in the symmetric distribution of inner @xmath95 values between -0.5 and 0.5 seen in fig .",
    "1 . for all but the high-@xmath0 solutions",
    ", @xmath95 shows a boundary layer - like profile , reaching a peak and then dropping rapidly to @xmath106 at the horizon .",
    "had we plotted @xmath107 , the profiles for all values of @xmath0 would resemble the @xmath95 profile for @xmath79 .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath108 drops steadily as @xmath0 increases .",
    "notice that @xmath108 includes the angular momentum associated with both the mass density and the energy density of the gas .",
    "the inner value of @xmath108 decreases from over 3 to less than 2 as @xmath0 goes from -0.999 to 0.999 .",
    "the actual rate of angular momentum accretion by the hole per unit rest mass accreted is @xmath41 .",
    "values for @xmath41 are generally close to the horizon values of @xmath108 .",
    "this means that the rate of viscous angular momentum transfer is very small near the horizon ; however , it is not zero .",
    "the relative disk thickness @xmath109 also varies dramatically with @xmath0 .",
    "notice that for all values of @xmath0 , @xmath109 is smaller near the horizon , then increases to @xmath110 at large radii .",
    "negative-@xmath0 flows are much thinner than positive-@xmath0 flows .",
    "figure 2 shows a set of solutions with @xmath111 , 0.003 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , all with @xmath92 , @xmath54 , and @xmath82 . both the sonic and viscous points move steadily outward as @xmath2 increases , since a larger @xmath2 gives a larger viscosity coefficient for given @xmath66 and @xmath112 , producing larger radial velocities @xmath16 .",
    "this removes more angular momentum and dissipates more energy , resulting in smaller values of @xmath108 and higher temperatures for larger @xmath2 .",
    "the higher temperature gives a larger relative disk thickness @xmath109 , and this combined with the larger radial velocity makes the density decrease as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the density and temperature profiles show an interesting effect at low @xmath2 : the development of a local maximum in density and temperature just outside the last stable orbit .",
    "this effect was also noted by nkh and cal .",
    "the maximum becomes more pronounced as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "it is faintly seen as an inflection in the density profile at @xmath113 , but by @xmath111 it produces a very large , wide peak with a density 50% larger than the density at the horizon .",
    "the maximum in the temperature profile is less dramatic , but the combined effect of the two is to produce a pressure maximum which affects the dynamics of the flow . on the inner side of this pressure maximum , the pressure gradient force points inward .",
    "this inward force is balanced in part by more rapid rotation : @xmath95 increases as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "in fact the @xmath111 solution even has a super-``keplerian '' rotation in a small region extending from @xmath114 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 was introduced to mock up the effects of cooling .",
    "the case of greatest interest for modeling adafs is when cooling is unimportant , so @xmath115 .",
    "we can reduce @xmath3 so that it is much less than @xmath116 , however , and in this case we should approximately recover a thin disk , albeit with a radial temperature structure that is not consistent with any realistic cooling function .",
    "figure 3 shows solutions for @xmath54 , 0.3 , 0.1 , 0.03 , 0.01 .",
    "all of the solutions have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the dramatically lower temperatures in low-@xmath3 solutions reduce @xmath66 and @xmath112 and thus reduce the viscous stress . as a result",
    ", this sequence of solutions strongly resembles the @xmath2 sequence shown in fig .",
    "2 . for small values of @xmath3 , as for small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "a maximum develops in density , temperature , and pressure in the inner disk for small values of @xmath3 , resulting in super - keplerian values of @xmath95 .",
    "the relative disk height drops as @xmath3 decreases , and the removal of angular momentum is less efficient .",
    "the major difference between the two sequences is that low values of @xmath3 produce much lower temperatures and higher densities than low values of @xmath2 .",
    "the low-@xmath3 solutions are indeed close to a thin disk . in particular ,",
    "the sonic point occurs close to the last stable circular orbit ( this is true for solutions with a variety of @xmath0 at low @xmath3 ) .",
    "also , the energy - at - infinity @xmath117 and angular momentum @xmath38 are close to their circular orbit values . of course",
    ", this is expected due to the low temperatures of these models , so that radial pressure gradients play a negligible role . nevertheless , it is good to see this expectation confirmed .",
    "the adiabatic index is not fixed by the temperature because some ( unknown ) fraction of the total pressure is contributed by the magnetic field , while the rest is contributed by gas pressure .",
    "figure 4 shows a sequence of solutions for a range of values of @xmath118 , 1.4444 , 1.55 , 1.66 .",
    "these correspond to the fraction of the pressure contributed by the gas pressure @xmath119 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 0.99 , respectively .",
    "all solutions have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the high-@xmath4 solutions get much hotter than the low-@xmath4 ones , increasing the effective viscosity coefficient .",
    "this produces higher velocities , larger relative disk heights , and removes more angular momentum . as @xmath4 approaches @xmath27 , these effects become extreme . for example , the @xmath120 solution has unphysically large values of @xmath96 .",
    "the black hole accretes both mass and angular momentum , so the dimensionless black hole spin parameter @xmath121 ( @xmath122 is the black hole angular momentum ) changes with time . in dimensionless form , @xmath123 where @xmath55 is the inward flux of mass - energy .",
    "thus if @xmath124 , then @xmath125 vanishes and the black hole has reached an equilibrium spin @xmath1 . the value of @xmath1 , if it exists , will depend on the input parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "notice that when @xmath54 , as in most of the solutions presented here , @xmath126 , and @xmath1 is reached when @xmath127 .",
    "the equilibrium spin is of considerable astrophysical interest since the observable properties of accretion flows change sharply in the neighborhood of @xmath128 . in an influential paper",
    ", @xcite showed that a black hole accreting from a thin disk reaches @xmath128 in a finite time .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if one takes account of the preferential accretion of angular momentum by the hole , then @xmath129 .",
    "@xcite suggested that even larger values of @xmath1 might still be obtained from a thick disk , based on numerical calculations that showed that the inner edge of these disks was located somewhere between the last stable orbit and the last bound orbit .    in order to calculate @xmath1",
    ", we have obtained sequences of solutions with increasing @xmath0 . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", @xmath41 decreases , and when @xmath130 we have found @xmath1 . in figure 5 above we show the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath0 for the six values of @xmath111 , 0.003 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , for which @xmath79 solutions were shown in fig .",

    ", @xmath41 decreases as @xmath0 increases , and decreases faster as @xmath0 approaches 1 , particularly in the low-@xmath2 solutions . here",
    "@xmath81 , so @xmath1 is reached when @xmath131 , as denoted by the dotted line .",
    "notice that @xmath1 is quite far from @xmath132 for high-@xmath2 flows : for @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 . on the other hand , for low-@xmath2 flows , @xmath1 is very close to 1 : for @xmath111 , we have @xmath135 .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 with @xmath2 is shown in figure 6 .",
    "for the sequence of @xmath111 , 0.003 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , we find @xmath136 . for @xmath137",
    "we find the approximate relation @xmath138 .",
    "we also obtained sequences in @xmath0 for values of @xmath3 between 0.01 and 1 , using @xmath139 .",
    "for @xmath140 we no longer have @xmath141 , so the full form of equation ( [ dadt ] ) is required .",

    "again we find an approximate power - law relationship @xmath144 .",
    "these results have some interesting implications .",
    "if most of the mass of a black hole is accreted through an adaf , then the hole can not approach @xmath128 .",
    "all advection - dominated models of observed systems that have appeared in the literature have high values of @xmath145 , since solutions with low @xmath2 have extremely low luminosities . according to the results given above",
    ", the black holes in these systems will not be able to spin up past @xmath146 .",
    "the most dramatic effects of the black hole spin on the flow , which appear when @xmath0 nears unity , will not be seen in such systems .    of course",
    ", the accretion of photon angular momentum is not included in our calculation , but this is justified where @xmath147 is small . in our flows , small values of @xmath3 correspond to thin disks , which radiate a fraction @xmath148 of the energy dissipated in the disk .",
    "the limiting spin @xmath1 also depends on @xmath3 , and we find that flows with @xmath149 will have @xmath150 , so they should stop spinning up before reaching the photon - transport limit",
    ". flows with @xmath151 have @xmath152 , so here the photon - transport limit is relevant .",
    "our disk equations differ in a number of respects from those used by other authors , as detailed in paper i and above . also ,",
    "the solutions described above cover a wider range of parameter space than previous studies .",
    "we have found solutions over the ranges of @xmath153 to @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "our sequence of solutions for @xmath158 resembles the solutions of nkh in many respects .",
    "we find sonic radii ranging from @xmath159 as @xmath2 increases , similar to the range @xmath160 found by nkh .",
    "our solutions also develop pressure maxima at small values of @xmath2 , as discussed below .",
    "since nkh used the pseudo - newtonian potential , their solutions have some unphysical properties near the horizon , which are avoided by our use of the full relativistic equations .",
    "our relativistic solutions with @xmath79 produce emission spectra which are qualitatively similar to those calculated from the nkh solutions .",
    "the densities tend to be somewhat higher near the horizon in our solutions due to the inclusion of relativistic effects , and this increases the luminosity of the flow substantially .",
    "this was shown by @xcite , who calculated the emission spectrum of sgr a * using the relativistic dynamical solutions described in this paper .",
    "they were thus able to make a direct comparison between the spectrum computed from our solution and that computed from a pseudo - newtonian solution as described by nkh .",
    "this showed that the inclusion of relativistic dynamics increased the emission by a factor of 10 - 100 in the infrared .",
    "note that relativistic photon transport effects are not included in these spectra , apart from including the gravitational redshift .",
    "also , the effects of using rotating black hole solutions have yet to be explored ; however , it is clear that the substantial increases in temperature and density near the horizon in these solutions will have a dramatic effect on the emission spectrum .",
    "acgl presented solutions with @xmath92 , 0.5 , and 0.99 for @xmath161 , which included bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "the shape of the @xmath162 curves is similar to ours ; however , the solutions differ in some other respects .",
    "first , the acgl solutions have larger values of @xmath38 at the inner edge of the flow .",
    "they find @xmath163 for @xmath164 , respectively , whereas our solutions have @xmath165 for these same values of @xmath0 .",
    "one reason for this is that their @xmath162 curves only extend in to the schwarzschild radius at @xmath166 , even for the @xmath167 and @xmath168 solutions , where the horizon sits at smaller radii .",
    "also , in acgl s scheme , the angular momentum eigenvalue which we call @xmath41 is equal to @xmath169 ( or in their notation , @xmath170 ) , whereas in our solutions , @xmath41 can differ substantially from @xmath169 due to viscous torques .",
    "our values of @xmath41 for these solutions are 2.62 , 2.31 , and 1.73 , which are somewhat closer to the acgl values .",
    "another difference between our solutions and those of acgl is that their solutions show a maximum in @xmath171 and inflections in @xmath172 close to the inner edge , whereas our solutions have @xmath173 and @xmath172 increasing smoothly all the way in to the horizon .",
    "pa have presented the most extensive survey of solutions to date .",
    "they find two types of viscous disk solutions : `` type i '' solutions at low values of @xmath2 ( @xmath174 in the solutions shown ) and `` type ii '' solutions at high @xmath2 ( @xmath175 in the solutions shown ) . one major difference between pa s scheme and ours is that they specify the angular momentum eigenvalue @xmath41 ( which they call @xmath42 ) while we solve for it .",
    "their type i solutions with @xmath2 ranging from 0.01 to 0.045 all have the same value of @xmath42 , and show great variation in their angular momentum profiles at large @xmath13 , whereas our solutions tend to have rather similar values of @xmath38 at large @xmath13 .",
    "pa s type i solutions also have a maximum in the sound speed outside the sonic point , and the sound speed then decreases down to the horizon .",
    "this may be a consequence of their polytropic equation of state , which requires that the sound speed must decrease inward if the radial velocity increases inward more rapidly than @xmath176 .",
    "their lowest-@xmath2 solutions at @xmath177 have a super - keplerian region in the inner part of the disk . in the type",
    "ii solutions shown by pa , the sonic point occurs far out in the flow at @xmath178 .",
    "this is a much larger sonic radius than in our high-@xmath2 solutions : our @xmath179 solution has @xmath180 .",
    "according to pa , their type ii solutions have the sonic point located at an outer critical point rather than an inner critical point as the type i solutions do .",
    "unlike pa , who found two types of solutions , and @xcite , who has found solutions where the flow goes through radial shocks , we find smooth solutions for the entire range of parameter values , and we see no evidence for sudden transitions between different types of solutions . in order to look for alternate solutions ,",
    "we varied @xmath69 and solved for the outer and middle sections of our solutions to see whether these sections would match up for an alternate value of @xmath69 . despite looking for alternate solutions with several choices of parameters , including low values of @xmath2 , we found no additional solutions .",
    "it is worth commenting in some detail on why our solutions are shock - free while those of @xcite are not .",
    "the origin of this difference lies in how the boundary conditions are treated .",
    "the difference is most easily explained by analogy with the problem of spherical ( bondi - hoyle ) accretion . to solve the bondi problem",
    "one specifies the density and temperature , but not the radial velocity ( nor , equivalently , the accretion rate ) , at large distance from the accreting object .",
    "the velocity at large radius is adjusted until the flow passes smoothly through the sonic point .",
    "this velocity , or the accretion rate , is thus an eigenvalue of the problem and must be solved for self - consistently .",
    "this approach has been validated by numerically solving a realistic initial value problem and showing that it settles down to the bondi solution . if one were to specify the radial velocity or accretion rate the flow would not generally pass smoothly through the sonic point",
    "; rather , it would shock .",
    "our treatment is analogous to the standard treatment of the bondi problem , except that in our case the mass accretion rate is specified , while the angular momentum accretion rate @xmath41 is the eigenvalue .",
    "it is adjusted so that the flow passes smoothly through the sonic point .",
    "chakrabarti s approach , on the other hand , is analogous to prespecifying the mass accretion rate in the bondi problem : he fixes @xmath41 . as a result",
    "the flow does not generally pass smoothly through the sonic point and his solutions contain one or more shocks .",
    "our intuition , and the analogy with the bondi problem , suggest that this is not the correct approach .",
    "the issue can only be settled conclusively , however , by solving a realistic initial value problem and showing that it converges to one solution or the other .",
    "this has not yet been done .",
    "our low-@xmath2 solutions have a maximum in pressure , density , and temperature in the inner disk .",
    "figure 7 shows density contours in the inner parts of the flow for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the contour plots are in the @xmath181 plane , and assume that @xmath182 .",
    "these solutions resemble the low-@xmath2 solutions of nkh .",
    "they are also similar to the thick disk models developed by a number of workers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular they have a pressure maximum , approximately constant specific angular momentum , and a region of super - keplerian rotation where pressure support is important .",
    "generally the pressure maximum lies close to the last stable orbit , and the sonic point lies close to the marginally bound orbit .",
    "our approximations are most accurate for these low-@xmath2 solutions in that @xmath96 is relatively small ( see figure 2 ) and the low viscosity implies a disk with relatively low turbulent velocities .",
    "it is not entirely clear that the low-@xmath2 models are relevant , however .",
    "a lower limit to the efficiency of angular momentum transport is set by the existence of the global hydrodynamic instability of @xcite .",
    "simulations of the nonlinear development of the magnetorotational instability ( @xcite ) suggest an even larger lower limit of order @xmath183 . for @xmath2 as large as this a pressure maximum does not develop , and the pressure increases smoothly down to the event horizon .    a new result of this study is the similarity of low-@xmath3 solutions to low-@xmath2 solutions .",
    "our @xmath184 and @xmath185 solutions show pronounced density and pressure maxima in the same region of the flow , just outside the last stable orbit .",
    "they also have super - keplerian rotation in this region",
    ". however , the low-@xmath3 solutions have the sonic point at @xmath186 for @xmath185 and at @xmath187 for @xmath184 , closer to the last stable orbit than the marginally bound orbit .",
    "the bernoulli parameter @xmath188 measures the sum of the kinetic energy , potential energy , and enthalpy of the gas .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995 ) pointed out that self - similar advection - dominated flows have a positive bernoulli parameter for @xmath189 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath188 suggests the possibility of a pressure - driven outflow ; @xmath188 is conserved for adiabatic , inviscid flows , so that gas with @xmath190 could flow outward adiabatically and still have positive kinetic energy at large radius .    in its relativistic form , @xmath191 , where @xmath192 .",
    "figure 8 shows @xmath188 for the solutions shown in figs .",
    "14 , illustrating the variation of @xmath188 with radius and with @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "solutions with small values of @xmath0 reach only small positive values of @xmath188 . in these solutions",
    ", @xmath188 tends to peak at @xmath193 , and reaches peak values of @xmath194 ( see fig .",
    "solutions with @xmath0 approaching unity can have substantially larger values of @xmath188 which peak at the horizon ( fig .",
    "solutions with @xmath195 , which radiate away a fraction @xmath148 of the dissipated energy , have @xmath196 . at large radii",
    ", the solution with @xmath197 has @xmath188 only slightly negative , as expected from the self - similar result that adafs with @xmath189 have @xmath190 .",
    "variations in the bernoulli parameter are directly related to the radial viscous energy flux , since the total radial flux of mass energy is conserved .",
    "we have @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the viscous stress tensor .",
    "recall that @xmath55 at the event horizon is the actual rate of change of the black hole mass ; furthermore , @xmath126 when @xmath54 .",
    "one can show that , if @xmath200 is the shear stress measured in the local rest frame of the fluid , then @xmath201 since @xmath202 at the horizon , @xmath203 is finite at the horizon .",
    "figure 9 shows the run of @xmath204 , the _ outward _ viscous energy flux , for solutions with several values of @xmath0 but otherwise with the standard parameters .",
    "the existence of a finite outward angular momentum and energy flux at the horizon suggests a violation of causality , yet our solution is manifestly causal .",
    "how can this be ?",
    "it turns out that these fluxes appear because of how the flow is divided into a mean and fluctuating part .",
    "consider a simple example : an accretion flow consisting of a turbulent , unmagnetized fluid with negligible density fluctuations . at a given event",
    ", the flow has angular momentum @xmath205 and radial four - velocity @xmath206 .",
    "the mean flow is defined so that @xmath207 and @xmath208 , where the brackets denote an average over @xmath209",
    ". then the outward flux of angular momentum is @xmath210 using the definition of the perfect fluid stress tensor . averaging , @xmath211.\\ ] ] the first term in brackets is due to the mean flow ; the second term is what we have called the `` viscous '' angular momentum flux .",
    "evidently the outward flux of angular momentum ( or energy ; the same considerations apply to @xmath212 ) appears because of how we have divided the flow into a mean and fluctuating part .",
    "correlations in the fluctuations merely bias the angular momentum of accreting fluid elements .",
    "causality is preserved .",
    "finally , it is worth offering a frank discussion of the assumptions behind our solutions and their limitations .",
    "a somewhat hidden assumption is that the accreting plasma is a two - temperature plasma with proton temperature much greater than the electron temperature .",
    "only then will @xmath115 .",
    "this can be true only if most of the `` viscous '' dissipation goes into the protons and there is no collective effect that efficiently couples the protons and electrons .",
    "no such effect has yet been convincingly demonstrated to exist .",
    "the assumption that @xmath3 is constant with radius is only likely to hold true if @xmath115 throughout the flow .",
    "we have nonetheless calculated solutions for constant @xmath140 in order to illustrate the effects of a smaller value of @xmath3 on the dynamical aspects of the flow . in the future , it is clear that models will need to include cooling processes and calculate @xmath3 self - consistently .",
    "this task is complicated by the importance of compton cooling in these flows , which depends not only on the local conditions at a particular radius , but also on the incident photon flux from all other radii .",
    "thus far , cooling has been included in some detail in some models , but no model has included both a full treatment of cooling and fully relativistic dynamics .    some additional assumptions and limitations of our solutions are tied to our treatment of angular momentum transport .",
    "for example , we have vertically averaged the flow .",
    "this should produce a reasonably reliable solution close to the midplane , but is not predictive for flow near the poles .",
    "we could produce a full axisymmetric steady - state solution , but because it is not known how turbulent angular momentum transport varies with height in the accretion flow , such an effort would not significantly improve the reliability of the solution .",
    "in addition , the flow has been assumed smooth and steady .",
    "this is likely to be true only in a time - averaged sense .",
    "in particular , if @xmath213 , then the turbulence that transports angular momentum will be only marginally subsonic and shocks and substantial density variations are likely .",
    "we have presented steady - state solutions in the kerr metric for advection - dominated accretion onto black holes .",
    "the solutions extend from @xmath214 down to just outside the event horizon at @xmath215 .",
    "the flow passes through a sonic point and a viscous point which arises due to our use of a causal viscosity prescription .",
    "we find large variations in the character of the flow by varying the solution parameters , which include the black hole spin @xmath0 , the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , the advected fraction @xmath3 , and the adiabatic index @xmath4 .",
    "we find smooth solutions without shocks throughout the parameter space .",
    "the innermost part of the flow near the horizon becomes much hotter and denser as @xmath0 approaches @xmath116 . also , the amount of angular momentum transferred to the black hole , which is an eigenvalue of our solutions , drops as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the structure of the flows is sensitive to @xmath2 , the efficiency of angular momentum transport . for @xmath216 ,",
    "the flows exhibit a pressure maximum and an approximately constant specific angular momentum profile , similar to the `` thick disk '' or `` ion tori '' models .",
    "the same holds true for solutions with small values of @xmath3 , even though the low-@xmath3 solutions are geometrically thin and are similar to the classical thin disk solutions in a number of respects .",
    "we find that an equilibrium spin rate @xmath1 exists for black holes accreting from an advection - dominated flow .",
    "this results from the decrease in the angular momentum accretion rate as @xmath0 increases . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the accreted angular momentum is just sufficient to counteract the effects of mass accretion and keep @xmath0 constant . for large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath217 , well below the maximum value of @xmath218 allowed by photon transport .",
