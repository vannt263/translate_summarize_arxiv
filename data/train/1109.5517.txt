    "experimental studies of hard exclusive processes , in particular , the production of dijets at midrapidities , has been recently performed at tevatron @xcite and will be done at the lhc in the near future @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the contribution of the gluon pairs to the exclusive hard dijets production dominates over that from quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "martin , ryskin and khoze proposed a qcd mechanism of exclusive digluon production @xcite . in certain regions of the phase space ,",
    "the process @xmath6 ( similarly to @xmath7 production ) is dominated by the non - perturbative region of gluon transverse momenta , and even perturbative ingredients like the sudakov form factor are not under full theoretical control @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even more pronounced when considering the irreducible backgrounds in central exclusive production ( cep ) of higgs boson originating from the direct exclusive @xmath8 pair production in a fusion of two off - shell gluons .",
    "in particular , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the central exclusive production of @xmath8 jets at the lhc , may noticeably shadow the corresponding signal of the higgs boson in the @xmath8 decay channel .",
    "along with unknown nlo corrections to the @xmath9-dependent hard subprocess amplitude @xmath10 ( in particular , the nlo contribution from the rescattering of the final state gluons into @xmath7 pairs can be potentially important ) , this may lead to problems in experimental identification of the higgs boson .",
    "recently , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the first lhc measurements of the exclusive dijets would significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainty for the central exclusive higgs boson production .",
    "this makes the process under consideration especially important from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "such a process has been recently investigated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and fairly good description of the tevatron data has been achieved .",
    "we would like to extend such an analysis , both analytically and numerically , by analyzing separate contributions from different final gluon polarisations , various kinematical regions of the 4-particle phase space , which are important for future lhc measurements , and the theoretical uncertainties related with different choice of ugdfs and the factorisation scale . similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall limit ourselves to the lowest - order qcd calculation , and postpone the analysis of the higher order contributions for a separate study .",
    "compared to the previous studies , we would like to perform an estimation of the process when one gluon is emitted from a one @xmath3-channel gluon of the qcd ladder and the second gluon is emitted from the other @xmath3-channel gluon .",
    "this contribution was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite as potentially sizable .",
    "in this work , we present the first numerical calculation of this contribution .",
    "recently , the calculation of the exclusive production of quark - antiquark dijets has been performed for heavy @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite pairs . here , we extend our previous analysis and present the calculation including both contributions from light ( @xmath13 ) and heavy ( @xmath14 ) quark / antiquark jets compared to the one from the gluonic jets .    a high precision measurement of exclusive @xmath12 pair production is required for central exclusive higgs production measurements @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , instructive to estimate the reducible background for higgs cep at lhc coming from misidentification of gluon jets .",
    "another interesting point , which we would like to investigate here , is the role of the gluon reggeization in the exclusive gluonic dijets production . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the formalism of the quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) with the lipatov s nonlocal vertices for the triple - gluon coupling @xcite , and perform a numerical comparison with the standard pqcd calculation ( with standard gluons ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section , we present the standard exclusive diffractive amplitude when both gluons are produced from the same @xmath3-channel gluonic line as well as the amplitude when one of the gluons is emitted from one line and the second gluon from the second line . in the third section ,",
    "we briefly remind formulae for quark - antiquark dijets with arbitrary quark mass .",
    "the fourth section contains discussion of unintegrated gluon densities and model assumptions . in the results section ,",
    "we present predictions for various differential distributions and compare our results with the available cdf data as well as discuss corresponding theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we also present predictions for future studies at lhc .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions close our paper .",
    "in this analysis , we apply the qcd mechanism for the central exclusive production , proposed by the durham group ( referred to below as the kmr approach ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggcep ] we show typical contributions to the exclusive gluon pair production . in the important limit of high-@xmath15 jets ,",
    "the diagram b is suppressed by an extra hard propagator .",
    "such a limit has been considered in detail in ref .",
    "however , at relatively small gluon @xmath2 s , the diagram b may become sizeable and a reliable numerical estimation of its contribution is required . in this paper , for generality , we would like to calculate both contributions in all potentially interesting regions of the 4-particle phase space .",
    "momenta of intermediate and final state gluons are given by the following sudakov decompositions in terms of incoming protons momenta @xmath16 @xmath17 in forward scattering limit , we then have @xmath18 the mandelstam invariants in the two - gluon fusion in the limit of high-@xmath19 gluon jets @xmath20 can be written as @xcite @xmath21 here and below , we use notations for the transverse 2-momenta in bold face style .",
    "let us first consider the explicit derivation of the diffractive amplitude shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggcep](a ) as an example .",
    "starting at the parton - level process and applying the cutting rules the imaginary part of the one - loop partonic amplitude of the gluon pair production with a fixed color indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be calculated in the forward limit as ( for similar derivation of higgs cep amplitude , see ref .",

    ", we apply the eikonal approximation for the quark - gluon verticies in the proton defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the gell - mann matricies , @xmath31 is the qcd coupling , and @xmath32 appears due to the fact that soft gluons can not change quark helicity in an energetic proton .    for the color singlet production (",
    "since in- and outgoing protons are in the color singlet state ) there is no color transfer from quark lines between protons , i.e. color indices in initial and final quarks are the same , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , the color averaging in each quark line leads to the substitution @xmath35 in the diffractive amplitude ( [ derivation ] ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath36 here automatically gives rise to the projection of the produced @xmath0-pair onto the color singlet state .",
    "further , in order to go over to the hadron level , one has to absorb the factor @xmath37 into a definition of the unintegrated ( @xmath38-dependent ) gluon distribution function ( ugdf ) along each proton line as required by the underlying @xmath1-factorisation approach @xcite .",
    "a reliable model for generalized off - diagonal ugdfs used in the current analysis will be discussed in some detail below .",

    "the obtained contribution is even larger than the @xmath12 one and overlays the standard model higgs signal . in the case of exclusive production of higgs boson beyond the standard model",

    "in the present paper we have discussed the exclusive production of dijets ( both digluon and quark - antiquark ones ) .",
    "we have included the contribution , previously known from the literature , when both gluons are emitted from the same @xmath3-channel gluon line , as well as new contributions when the gluons are emitted from different @xmath3-channel gluon lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ggcep ] ) .",
    "we have presented corresponding formulae with simple prescriptions for the unintegrated gluon distributions relevant for these two cases . for both contributions , we made predictions for various differential distributions at tevatron ( 1.96 tev ) and lhc ( 14 tev ) energies , including an analysis of different gluon polarisation contributions and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the diagram b contribution turned out to be much smaller than the one ( diagram a ) known from the literature .",
    "they become comparable only for large rapidity differences of both jets where the cross section is rather small or when the jet transverse momenta are small .",
    "the latter case can be , therefore , very important for the central diffractive production of pions .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we have found that jets corresponding to the mechanism of diagram b are strongly correlated in their rapidities . this is a consequence of a specific behavior of off - diagonal gluon distributions in the erbl region where @xmath198 .",
    "we have compared our results with the cdf collaboration data .",
    "our cross sections are somewhat larger than those obtained in the literature . compared to those calculations ,",
    "we have performed integration starting from smaller lower limit for screening gluon transverse momenta and with the choice of scale in the sudakov form factor as advocated by coughlin and forshaw @xcite .",
    "our observation may mean e.g. that the gap survival probabilities are smaller than usually assumed for this process .",
    "clearly , further work on this issue is required .",
    "we have discussed also the dijet reducible background to the central exclusive higgs boson production . in the framework of the same model",
    ", we have calculated the contribution of the quark - antiquark jets cep .",
    "we have found that this contribution is much smaller than that for the gluon - gluon dijets in the whole phase space .",
    "however , the quark contribution , especially the @xmath12 one , is very important , as it constitutes an irreducible background for exclusive production of the higgs boson . on the other hand ,",
    "the gluonic jets can be misidentified as the @xmath12 jets and in this sense they also contribute to a background for exclusive production of the higgs boson .",
    "if both gluonic jets are misidentified as @xmath46 or anti-@xmath46 quark jets , then this leads to an extra background to exclusive higgs boson production when the higgs boson is observed in the @xmath12 decay channel .",
    "this extra contribution can be even more important than the irreducible @xmath12 contribution .",
    "when the realistic atlas misidentification factor is included one obtains the total background which significantly exceeds the higgs signal .",
    "this observation suggests that the experimental observation of the exclusive standard model higgs production may be very challenging .",
    "the situation may be better for beyond the standard model higgs boson production though , but corresponding detailed analysis including a monte - carlo simulation of backgrounds still needs to be done .",
    "we are particularly indebted to igor ivanov for valuable discussions on theoretical issues related to ugdfs and the sudakov form factor .",
