    "the electronic properties of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been studied for almost two decades by now and are generally thought to be well understood.@xcite the electronic structure of a cnt on energy scales below @xmath1 , with radius @xmath2 and fermi velocity @xmath3  m / s , is captured by the low - energy approach , where one retains only the lowest transverse momentum bands and disregards trigonal warping .",

    "two interesting developments concern spin - orbit interactions ( soi ) and proximity - induced pairing correlations .",

    "the chemical potential on the tube is assumed to be tunable via a nearby gate electrode.,width=302 ]    in this work , we demonstrate that the combined effects of strong soi and proximity - induced superconductivity in cnts are responsible for emergent gapless dirac fermions and majorana bound states .",
    "the schematic set - up considered here is shown in fig .",
    "apart from the spiral magnetic field used to generate strong spin - orbit couplings , the set - up is similar to recent proposals for semiconducting nanowires.@xcite in both cases , despite of the presence of the superconducting film generating the proximity - induced pairing in the wire ( or cnt ) , one can change the chemical potential @xmath9 in the wire via a gate voltage .",
    "our first step below is to show that experimentally available@xcite spiral magnetic fields offer strong effective soi in cnts , see also ref .  .",
    "as has been discussed in ref .  , it is possible to apply a spiral magnetic field to the cnt despite of the presence of the superconductor .",
    "we then proceed with a symmetry analysis of all possible proximity - induced pairing terms in the low - energy theory for a cnt in contact to an @xmath10-wave bcs superconductor . employing experimentally realistic parameters",

    "the gap closing can be probed experimentally by tunneling spectroscopy . for small - bandgap semiconducting cnts with magnetic field in the same plane , however , the zero mode is non - degenerate and at @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that majorana bound states ( mbss)@xcite form at the tube ends .",
    "majorana fermions may be useful for topological quantum computation,@xcite and their realization is now actively pursued in many different material systems.@xcite using insb nanowires , a set - up similar to fig .",

    "such cnt crossings have been experimentally realized already a decade ago.@xcite    mbss in cnts have also been proposed in two other papers , relying on either the intrinsic curvature - induced soi@xcite or@xcite on an electric - field induced soi.@xcite our paper is more closely related to the sau - tewari proposal,@xcite but differs in two important regards .",
    "first , the spiral magnetic field induces a much stronger soi than the curvature - induced soi in cnts .",
    "second , this field also generates an effective periodic potential along the cnt , which automatically breaks valley ( @xmath12 ) degeneracy and implies a greatly enhanced robustness of the zero mode sector from which we explicitly construct the mbs . as a consequence , while the valley mixing parameter @xmath13 is essential in the sau - tewari proposal,@xcite it plays no significant role in the parameter space relevant for mbs generation in our proposal . for completeness",

    "the case @xmath34 ( field in a plane perpendicular to cnt ) could , for instance , be realized using the hyperfine nuclear fields discussed by braunecker _",
    "et al._,@xcite and the resulting soi formally coincides with the electric - field induced soi studied in ref .  , where we also recover their helical state solutions . the case @xmath35 ( field in the same plane as the cnt ) has been realized experimentally using magnetic superlattices.@xcite",

    "note that an orbital field in tube direction causes a periodic potential with amplitude @xmath45 experimentally , it turns out that this estimate for @xmath46 in some devices is enhanced by a factor @xmath47 to @xmath48 of unknown origin.@xcite without soi and superconducting pairing , periodic potentials have recently been studied theoretically in cnts@xcite and graphene.@xcite    at this point , we briefly comment on the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) properties of @xmath49 .",

    "violating trs are the zeeman term @xmath53 and the orbital flux @xmath54 .",
    "next we discuss the proximity effect due to an @xmath10-wave singlet superconducting substrate . to that end , we first write down all @xmath10-wave singlet pairing terms in the cnt which are consistent with trs . with unity operator @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) in valley ( sublattice ) space ,",
    "we obtain the `` zoology '' of allowed pairing terms , @xmath57 terms @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) correspond to different substrate couplings for the two sublattices ( valleys ) and have been omitted in eq .  . in a generic situation ,",

    "such terms describe triplet pairing in the cnt , which can not be generated by coupling to an @xmath10-wave superconductor .    the large number of parameters in eq .",
    "can now be greatly reduced by resorting to physical arguments .",
    "the simplest and most likely dominant contribution to the proximity effect comes from intra - sublattice ( same orbital ) pairing : in a microscopic lattice model , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 runs over all atoms in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this pairing mechanism corresponds to the three terms @xmath65 in eq .  .",
    "another possibility comes from pairing between nearest - neighbor atoms ( different sublattices ) .",
    "this mechanism explains all remaining terms [ @xmath66 in eq .  , but it has a much smaller amplitude because the two sublattices are not commensurate .",
    "this implies that the @xmath67-oscillatory anomalous green s function in the superconductor basically averages out . neglecting these subleading contributions ,",
    "we are left with the terms @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq .  .",

    "since the gap closings reported below are also found for @xmath72 , we omit , say , the @xmath69 term in @xmath44 .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath73 with the proximity - induced gap @xmath74 and the `` pairing angle '' @xmath75 .",
    "this angle interpolates between pure inter - valley ( @xmath76 ) and intra - valley ( @xmath77 ) pairing .",
    "the actual value for @xmath75 depends on how strongly rotational symmetry around the cnt axis is broken by the presence of the substrate .",
    "if rotational symmetry stays intact , different valleys form time - reversed partner states and have to be paired,@xcite resulting in @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "trs - invariant intra - valley pairing ( @xmath77 ) dominates for strongly broken rotational symmetry.@xcite    let us now briefly consider the case without the spiral magnetic field , @xmath78 in eq .  , where @xmath79 is conserved . introducing the two proximity gap scales @xmath80 the dispersion relation follows from @xmath81",
    "when only one pairing term is present ( @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) , the two gap scales coincide , @xmath82 , and the two pairing mechanisms can not be distinguished unless the magnetic field is also present .",
    "otherwise , however , the pairing angle is detectable since then @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , the dispersion relation may become gapless for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "analytical diagonalization of the hamiltonian with @xmath44 in eq .   is not possible except for special cases , and in general we have to resort to numerics .",
    "bloch s theorem implies that eigenstates for the @xmath86th energy band , @xmath87 , are of the form @xmath88 with the multi - index @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( and so on ) .",

    "the @xmath46 term couples @xmath93 and @xmath94 states , and diagonalization of the resulting hamiltonian matrix yields @xmath87 and the eigenstates ( [ bloch ] ) .",
