    "the quantum point contact ( qpc ) is a prime example of a mesoscopic structure that demonstrates a striking quantum mechanical ballistic transport phenomenon .",
    "it exhibits a quantization of conductance in units of @xmath3@xmath4@xmath0 where the factor of 2 accounts for spin degeneracy.@xcite this effect has been observed in many two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) with mean - free - path longer than the qpc channel length .",
    "it arises as a consequence of the quantization of transverse momentum and full transmission of the one - dimensional modes in the constriction , reminiscent of quantum hall effect where the absence of backscattering leads to quantized plateaus in the hall resistance .",
    "quantized conductance in qpcs has been observed and studied in many 2d carrier systems including electrons in gaas , @xcite",
    "sige,@xcite gan,@xcite insb , @xcite and holes in gaas.@xcite    here we report transport measurements of a qpc device realized in a 2des confined to an 11 nm - wide , modulation - doped alas quantum well grown on a gaas ( 001 ) substrate .",
    "the novelty of this system is that the 2d electrons occupy conduction band valleys located at the x points of the brillouin zone .",
    "there are two anisotropic , elliptical fermi contours , each characterized by a heavy longitudinal mass @xmath5@xmath4@xmath6 and a light transverse mass @xmath7@xmath4@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron mass in vacuum.@xcite our qpc device is fabricated via shallow - etching and depositing a top gate that covers the entire sample and controls the density in both the 2d reservoir and the qpc channel . as outlined in the abstract , the conductance vs gate bias trace of this device exhibits several interesting features , some of which are puzzling . in the next section , we summarize these observations and briefly describe their origin ; the rest of the paper is devoted to the details of the device and a quantitative explanation of conductance vs gate bias data .",
    "figure  [ figgtrace ] presents our main finding . it shows the conductance ( @xmath10 ) trace of the qpc device measured at @xmath11=0.3 k as a function of the applied gate voltage ( @xmath12 ) and the corresponding transconductance trace ( @xmath13 ) that accentuates the features in @xmath10 .",
    "three features of the data are noteworthy .",
    "first , we observe developing quantized conductance steps near integer multiples ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath0 up to @xmath15 ; these steps are exhibited more clearly in the transconductance plot of fig .  [",
    "figgtrace](b).@xcite second , the @xmath0 conductance plateaus seem to get stronger monotonically at higher @xmath14 .",
    "third , we observe a particularly strong plateau near 0.7@xmath16 .",
    "perhaps the most puzzling feature of fig .",
    "[ figgtrace ] data is that , even though the system is expected to have a two - fold valley degeneracy , we do not observe quantized steps at integer multiples of @xmath17 but instead at multiples of @xmath0 .",
    "as we discuss in detail in the remainder of the paper , this happens because the mass anisotropy breaks the valley degeneracy of the qpc subband energy levels .",
    "the valley with higher mass in the qpc ( lateral ) confinement direction has lower energy and therefore dominates the low - lying subband states .",
    "moreover a small but finite residual valley splitting present in the system further helps lift the valley degeneracy .",
    "next , the overall weakness of the observed plateaus in fig .  [ figgtrace ] imply that the qpc energy subband spacings are comparable to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 is the system temperature . this is not surprising , considering the rather large effective mass of electrons ( compared to , e.g. , gaas 2d electrons ) which leads to small subband spacings .",
    "the fact that the conductance plateaus get stronger monotonically at higher conductance steps [ fig .",
    "[ figgtrace](b ) ] , on the other hand , is somewhat puzzling .",
    "this distinct feature is not observed in conventional surface split - gate qpcs.@xcite .",
    "we attribute it mainly to two characteristics of our device .",
    "first , since our qpc constriction is defined using shallow - etching and gating ( in contrast to only gating using split - gate ) , we expect the lateral confinement potential to be strong,@xcite resembling a square well potential ( fig .",
    "[ figqpcschematic ] ) .",
    "in such a potential , the energy subband spacing @xmath20 increases at higher @xmath14 , therefore at a given temperature , the subband spacing will be better resolved .",
    "second , the electron mean - free - path in our device is comparable to the length of the channel .",
    "as we increase the gate voltage , the density in the qpc channel increases , resulting in higher electron mobility and longer electron mean - free - path.@xcite this results in a better transmission across the qpc and thus a better plateau formation at higher @xmath12 .",
    "we note that , a monotonic increase in strength of @xmath0 plateaus suggests that the quantized energy levels originate from a single valley .",
    "any accidental degeneracy between @xmath21 and @xmath22 valley 1d energy levels in the qpc would lead to non - monotonic energy level spacings and would cause a deterioration or missing of conductance plateaus , in contrast to the monotonic increase in plateau strength as observed here .    finally , the conductance plateau we observe near 0.7@xmath16 is particularly strong compared to the other plateaus in our qpc device or the `` 0.7 structure '' plateaus reported for qpcs fabricated using other 2d systems .",
    "the origin of the `` 0.7 structure '' is still unknown although there is a general consensus that , unlike the integer plateaus , it may be caused by electron - electron interaction .",
    "@xcite our observation is consistent with such interpretation as we indeed do expect interaction to be strong in our system because of the heavy electron effective mass .",

    "the energy level spacings are expected to be very small , rendering the observation of quantized conductance challenging .",
    "we tried a number of split - gate structures with no success in observing quantized conductance steps .",
    "experiments on high quality alas quantum wires fabricated via the cleaved - edge - overgrowth technique , have not yielded clear quantized plateaus either.@xcite we therefore took an alternative approach and defined the qpc constriction by shallow - etching to introduce a strong qpc confinement , @xcite and then covered the entire device by a ti / au top gate that controls the 2des density ( and thus @xmath27 ) in the reservoir and in the qpc constriction [ fig .",
    "[ figqpcschematic](a ) ] .",
    "as we demonstrate later in the paper , this device structure allows us to directly probe the energy spacing between the qpc quantized energy levels .",

    "these kinks occur when @xmath27 lies in the middle of an energy gap .",

    "we construct an idealized conductance steps trace shown by dashed lines in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figqpcmodelx](c ) .",
    "the positions where the level crossings occur are marked as circles ( labeled with their subband indices @xmath43 to 5 ) .    figure  [ figqpcmodelx](b ) assumes that the qpc has an elevated bottom potential , with an offset @xmath44 , with respect to the 2des reservoir potential .",
    "this is to model the fact that the qpc has a pinch - off voltage @xmath45 v ( fig .",
    "[ figgtrace ] ) even though the density in the 2d reservoir is non - zero at this voltage .",
    "we take @xmath44 to be equal to @xmath27 at @xmath46 .    in the qpc channel ,",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 valleys have a different set of quantized energy levels as shown in figure  [ figqpcmodelx](b ) .",
    "this happens because , thanks to the different valley orientations , the electrons in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 valleys have different effective masses along the lateral confinement direction .",
    "this mass anisotropy breaks the degeneracy of the quantized levels in the channel .",
    "since the confinement potential is strong and quantized energies are small due to heavy electron effective mass , we can estimate the 1d subbands energy levels using an infinite square well model : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the electron mass along the qpc confinement direction ; @xmath48 is equal to @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) for the @xmath22 ( @xmath21 ) valley .",

    "simple theoretical estimates , confirmed by experimental results , indicate that the depletion width decreases with increasing 2des density.@xcite in addition , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figqpcschematic](c ) , the top gate covering the shallow - etched region comes to close proximity of the qpc channel ( somewhat similar to a split - gate device ) so that changing the gate bias may also influence the channel width electrostatically .",
    "therefore , we expect that the channel width @xmath28 would increase at higher @xmath12 where the density is higher .",
    "it is possible to estimate the channel width from the qpc magnetoresistance ( mr).@xcite figure  [ figqpcmr ] shows the longitudinal mr ( @xmath54 ) traces across the qpc and the transverse mr ( @xmath52 ) measured in one of the reservoir regions ( see fig .",
    "[ figqpcmr ] inset ) .",
    "the @xmath54 traces exhibit strong negative mr at low field .",
    "this negative mr arises from the suppression of the constriction resistance by the magnetic field in the ballistic regime . as the magnetic field is increased , the electron backscattering rate is reduced and a larger fraction of the edge states are transmitted through the channel , resulting in a smaller resistance.@xcite this behavior persists up to a magnetic field @xmath50 at which the classical cyclotron diameter equals the channel width . at @xmath50",

    "@xcite ideally , we could obtain density information in the 2d reservoirs from mr measurements in a plain 2d region adjacent to the qpc .",
    "unfortunately , there are no contacts available to measure such a region in our device .",
    "thus , to obtain the density in the 2d reservoirs alone , we deduce the sdh oscillations from @xmath53 that represents the `` longitudinal mr '' following the empirical resistance rule.@xcite it has been shown that the hall resistance is unaffected by the presence of the qpc constriction .",

    "we assign the frequency component c , which appears only in @xmath54 fourier spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ figfft](b ) ] , to the total density in the qpc channel .",

    "in contrast , a spin filter is much more difficult to implement.@xcite furthermore , by simply orienting the qpc transport directions along either [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] , one can choose which valley species to filter .",
    "alternatively , one could preserve the valley degeneracy in the qpc by orienting the qpc with its transport direction along [ 110 ] .",
    "finally , it is possible to control the valley populations by applying tunable strain using a piezo - actuator to which the sample is glued.@xcite",
