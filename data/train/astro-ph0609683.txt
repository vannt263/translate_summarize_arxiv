    "independent data from different observations@xcite provide strong support for the existence of de and seem to agree that it presently constitutes @xmath0 of the total energy density .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of de remains unclear .",
    "if we identify it with a cosmological constant ( cc ) arising from the quantum field theory ( qft ) vacuum energy , as done in the @xmath1cdm model@xcite , we are led to a value many orders of magnitude greater than the measured one , what has been called the cc problem @xcite .",
    "this problem could be alleviated by means of a dynamical de .",
    "this possibility is supported by some recent studies@xcite and has been exploited profusely in various forms @xcite . among them",
    "the scalar fields are the most paradigmatic scenario .",
    "it must be stressed though that the presence of a scalar field is not essential for a model to be described in terms of an effective eos , @xmath2 ( for instance , this has been proven for any model with variable cosmological parameters in @xcite ) .",
    "we present here a model in which the de , in addition of being dynamical , is allowed to be composite .",
    "this model may offer an explanation to the `` cosmological coincidence problem''@xcite -i.e .",
    "to the fact that the de and matter densities happen to be similar precisely at the present epoch- by keeping the ratio between these two densities bounded and of order 1 during the entire universe existence . at the same time",
    ", the effective eos of our model can match the available data .",
    "this feature is exemplified through specific numerical examples .",
    "the @xmath1xcdm @xcite is a minimal realization of a composite de model in which the de consists of a running @xmath1@xcite and another entity , @xmath4 , that may interact with it .",
    "we call this new entity the `` cosmon''@xcite .",
    "the nature of @xmath4 is not specified , although a most popular possibility would be some scalar field @xmath5 resulting e.g. from string theory at low energy . in the generalized sense defined here , the cosmon stands for any dynamical contribution to the de other than the vacuum energy effects .",
    "the model under study contains matter - radiation ( @xmath6 ) and dynamical de @xmath7 , where the two de components have barotropic indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath4 can be both quintessence ( qe ) ( @xmath10 ) or phantom - like ( @xmath11 ) , that is : @xmath12 . assuming @xmath13 ( another realization of the @xmath1xcdm model in which g can also be variable is considered in @xcite ) and the conservation of matter - radiation , the bianchy identities give us : @xmath14 where @xmath15 for the matter and the radiation dominated epoch respectively .",
    "the effective eos parameter of the model reads : @xmath16 another fundamental equation for our model is friedmann s equation : @xmath17 from it , the generalized form of the ` cosmic sum rule ' within our model is easily derived : @xmath18 we still need another equation apart from ( [ conslawde2 ] ) , ( [ fl ] ) , so we have to provide a model either for @xmath4 or for @xmath19",
    ". we will do the latter in order to preserve the generic nature of @xmath4 , its dynamics being then determined by the bianchi identity through ( [ conslawde2 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the following rg equation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy scale associated to the rg in cosmology ( that we will identify with the hubble parameter at any given epoch,@xcite ) and @xmath22 is a free parameter that essentially provides the squared ratio of the heavy masses contributing to the @xmath23-function of @xmath1 versus the planck mass , @xmath24 ( and thus we naturally expect @xmath25 ) . equation ( [ rgeg1b ] ) with @xmath26",
    "is the equation we were looking for in order to solve the model .",
    "but before that , let us take a closer look at the implications of having a composite de .",
    "taking the derivative of ( [ fl ] ) and using as well ( [ conslawde2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath27=-\\frac { 4\\pi\\,g}{3}\\,[{\\rho_m}\\,(1 + 3{\\omega_m})-2\\,{\\rho_{{\\lambda}}}+{\\rho_x}\\,(1 + 3{\\omega_x})]\\,.\\label{dda}\\ ] ] note that if @xmath28 _ but also _",
    "@xmath29 , then the @xmath4 component decelerates the expansion instead of accelerating it . and",
    "this is perfectly possible in our model thanks to the composite nature of the de : e.g. , at present ( [ sumrule0 ] ) tells us -in the flat case- that @xmath30 but either @xmath31 or @xmath32 could be negative . in particular",
    ", it can occur that @xmath29 and @xmath33 , the cosmon being therefore phantom - like _ but _ with @xmath34 ( in contrast to the  standard  phantom condition @xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 fulfills the strong energy condition ( sec ) -satisfied by matter but violated by `` usual '' phantom and qe components- , behaving thus like a sort of unclustered `` matter '' that we call `` phantom matter '' ( pm ) , see fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "this behavior is possible in any model with composite de",
    ".    we will see ( c.f .",
    "sect.[sec : coin ] ) that the solution to the coincidence problem is linked to the existence of a point @xmath36 where the universe expansion stops ( and subsequently reverses ) , i.e. @xmath37 . although in our model we can have @xmath38 , this stopping point can be achieved even if @xmath39 thanks to the behavior of @xmath4 as pm .",
    "from now on we will assume spatial flatness and constant @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the general case ) . instead of @xmath40 or @xmath41",
    "we will use @xmath42 as the independent variable @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . in this way our basic set of equations becomes an autonomous system : @xmath46\\,{\\omega_{x}}-\\nu\\,{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{\\lambda}}+\\nu\\,{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{c}}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\dot{\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}=\\nu\\,({\\alpha_m}-{\\alpha_x})\\,{\\omega_{x}}+\\nu\\,{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{\\lambda}}-\\nu\\,{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{c}}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\dot{\\omega}_c=({\\alpha_m}-{\\alpha_x})\\,{\\omega_{x}}+\\,{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{\\lambda}}-{\\alpha_m}\\,{\\omega_{c}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",
    "all @xmath49 are normalized to the present critical density , @xmath50 .",

    "the expansion rate is sensitive to the amount of de , and therefore primordial nucleosynthesis can place stringent bounds on the parameters of the @xmath1xcdm model .",
    "we will ask for the ratio between de and matter radiation densities to be sufficiently small at the nucleosynthesis epoch , @xmath55 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . from ( [ solve2 ] ) : @xmath56 where we have returned to @xmath41 as the independent variable for a while . at @xmath57",
    "we can neglect @xmath58 in the numerator and ( remembering we are in the radiation era ) we get : @xmath59 now , keeping in mind that @xmath60 and that @xmath61 , it is easy to see that : @xmath62 there is an irreducible contribution of the de to the total energy density in the radiation era . looking again at ( [ rz ] ) , but this time at the dark energy dominated era , we find that @xmath63 can present ( at most ) one extremum at some @xmath64@xcite .",
    "let us prove that the existence of a future stopping of the expansion ( feature that can occur within our model , c.f .",
    "sect.[sec : num ] ) implies that of a future maximum of @xmath63 -and viceversa- . by ( [ fl ] ) and ( [ dda ] ) : @xmath65\\rho_m(0 ) \\,,\\label{acc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that , since @xmath68 , the current state of accelerated expansion requires @xmath69 .",
    "now , if the rhs of ( [ fl-1 ] ) is positive , @xmath70 and the ratio is unbounded .",
    "moreover , as @xmath69 and the @xmath63 is a smooth function with _ at most _ one extremum@xcite , there can not be any extremum in the future , and thus the de ca nt get negative and there is no stopping point . on the contrary , if the rhs of ( [ fl-1 ] ) is negative , as @xmath71 is also continuous , then @xmath37 at some @xmath72 .",
    "being @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath73 it is obvious that there must be a maximum of @xmath63 at some point between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( _ q.e.d . _ ) .      from the solution of the model ( [ solve2 ] )",
    ", we find that in the asymptotic past and for @xmath76 : @xmath77 this comes as a bit of a surprise : at very high redshift the effective eos of the de coincides with that of matter - radiation .",
    "this behavior could be detected given that it enforces : @xmath78 that means that the measures of the parameter @xmath79 from cmb fits ( high @xmath41 ) and supernovae data fits ( low @xmath41 ) could differ , the relative difference @xmath80 being just given by the nucleosynthesis constraint ( [ nb1 ] ) .",
    "thus the effect could amount to a measurable @xmath81 , what makes it a distinctive signature of the @xmath1xcdm model .",
    "let us illustrate our considerations with some examples . taking the prior @xmath82@xcite ,",
    "we are left with three free parameters : @xmath83 , over which we will impose that :    * \\i ) the nucleosynthesis bound ( the _ exact _ one in ( [ nb1 ] ) ) is fulfilled : @xmath84 ; * \\ii ) there is a stopping point in the future universe evolution ; * \\iii ) the ratio @xmath63 is not only bounded ( what is guaranteed by the stopping of the expansion ) but also stays relatively small , say @xmath85 .",
    "the points satisfying all three conditions constitute a significant part of the full parameter space as seen in the @xmath86 plot in fig.[fig1](b ) . as an example",
    ", we consider the specific situation @xmath87 and @xmath88 . looking at the system ( [ autonomous1 ] ) , we see that @xmath89 , so there is a saddle point in the phase space , @xmath90 , from which trajectories diverge with the evolution ( as @xmath91 ) . this runaway , however , can be stopped provided @xmath92 in ( [ eig ] ) . indeed , since the eigenvector @xmath93 defines a runaway direction , if @xmath92 the third component of ( [ solve2 ] ) will eventually become negative , and there will be a stopping . using ( [ nb1 ] ) , the stopping condition acquires the form : @xmath94    these features can be seen in fig.[fig2](a ) , where the trajectories corresponding to a fixed value of @xmath8 and @xmath22 and various values of @xmath95 have been plotted in the ( @xmath96 ) plane .",
    "only the curves that fulfil ( [ c1approx ] ) get stopped .",
    "the hubble function of one of the stopped trajectories is plotted in fig.[fig2](b ) , showing indeed the existence of a turning point , that in this case , as discussed in sect.[sec : pm ] , is due to the behavior of the cosmon as pm .",
    "the analysis of the eos is one of the most important issues addressed in the present and future experiments .",
    "recent combined data@xcite suggest a value : @xmath97 this result _ does _ depend on the assumption that the eos parameter does _ not _ evolve with time or redshift , so it is not directly applicable to the effective eos of our model .",
    "even so , we can find many scenarios that are in good agreement with it , as shown in fig.[fig3](a ) .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath22 modulates the behavior of the eos , that can be qe - like ( even though the @xmath4 is phantom - like ! , see ( [ eeos ] ) ) , mimic that of a cc or present a mild evolution from the phantom to the qe region .    all the curves in fig.[fig3](a ) satisfy ( [ c1approx ] ) , presenting a stopping point and therefore ( c.f .",
    "sect.[sec : coin ] ) a maximum of @xmath63 .",
    "this ratio is plotted in fig.[fig3](b ) in units of its current value ( @xmath98 ) , showing that @xmath63 remains bounded and @xmath99 for essentialy the entire universe lifetime , which provides a natural solution to the coincidence problem .",
    "let us stress that these features can occur even for @xmath100 ( that is , for a strictly constant @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1xcdm model can be in good agreement with present data and provide a solution to the cosmological coincidence problem as well as a clear signature . in our opinion",
    "the next generation of high precision cosmology experiments ( des , snap , planck)@xcite should consider the possibility of a composite de with dynamics controlled by the running of the cosmological parameters .    this work has been supported in part by ministerio de eduacin y ciencia of spain ( mec ) and feder under project 2004 - 04582-c02 - 01 , and also by dursi under 2005sgr00564 .",
