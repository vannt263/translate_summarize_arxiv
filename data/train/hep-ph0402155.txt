    "the problem with this expression for @xmath23 is that all matrix elements are of the same order and the vanishing of @xmath26 as well as the hierarchy of the eigenvalues arise from precise relations among the different matrix elements .",
    "for example , the result @xmath13 is obtained because the eigenvector with zero eigenvalue is of the form @xmath27 and the crucial zero is present because the first two columns are proportional in eq .",

    "consider , for comparison , the case where we do not make the hypothesis that all the mixings are generated by the charged leptons , but rather that @xmath28 . to make the comparison more direct ,",

    "we can also replace the terms of order 1 in the 23 sector by generic order 1 quantities provided that we have a natural way of guaranteeing that the subdeterminant 23 is suppressed and remains of order @xmath33 .",
    "as well known this suppression can be naturally induced through the see - saw mechanism either by dominance of a single right - handed majorana neutrino @xcite or by a lopsided @xcite neutrino dirac matrix .",
    "natural realizations of this strategy have been constructed , for example , in the context of u(1)@xmath34 flavour models @xcite .",
    "we now come back to the expression for the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ mev ] ) where the matrix @xmath22 appears .",
    "this matrix describing the right - handed mixings of charged leptons is not related to neutrino mixings . in minimal su(5 ) the relation @xmath35 holds between the charged lepton and the down quark mass matrices . in this case @xmath22 describes the left - handed down quark mixings : @xmath36 .",
    "the ckm matrix , as well known , is given by @xmath37 .",
    "given that the quark mixing angles are small , either both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are nearly diagonal or they are nearly equal .",

    ".[mev1 ] this matrix is a generalization of lopsided models with all three matrix elements in the third row of order 1 ( unless @xmath9 is small : for small solar angle we go back to the situation of normal lopsided models ) .",
    "we recall that lopsided models with the 23 and 33 matrix elements of order 1 provide a natural way to understand a large 23 mixing angle .",
    "in fact from the matrix relation =  , [ lop ] we see that in lopsided models one automatically gets a large 23 mixing from @xmath2 . in the generalized case of eq .",
    "( [ mev1 ] ) , while the natural prediction of a large 23 mixings remains , the relation @xmath13 does not arise automatically if the entries of the matrix are replaced by generic order 1 terms in the third row and of order @xmath42 in the second row .",
    "if we call @xmath43 the 3-vector with components of order 1 in the third row and @xmath44 the vector of the second row , we can easily check that to obtain @xmath13 it is needed that @xmath45 and also that @xmath46 is orthogonal to a vector of the form @xmath47 .    in democratic models all matrices @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath2 are nearly equal and the smallness of quark mixings arises from a compensation between @xmath48 and @xmath39 .",
    "this sort of models correspond , for @xmath36 , to @xmath49 and a symmetric matrix @xmath14 : @xmath50 . in this case",

    "note in fact , that in the democratic model of @xcite , the vanishing of @xmath26 is only accommodated but not predicted .",
    "we now attempt to identify a set of conditions that make possible the construction of an explicit model where the mixing in the lepton sector is dominated by the charged lepton contribution .",
    "one obvious condition is a dynamical or a symmetry principle that forces the light neutrino mass matrix to be diagonal in the lagrangian basis .",
    "the simplest flavour symmetries can not fulfill this requirement in a simple way .",

    "the problem with this matrix is that the ratio between the solar and the atmospheric squared mass differences , close to 1/40 , is approximately given by @xmath54 and , consequently , a large atmospheric mixing angle is already induced by @xmath55 itself . if we consider a discrete symmetry like @xmath56 , @xmath55 can be of the general form : m_= m + m  , [ mnus3 ] where @xmath57 is an arbitrary parameter . in this case",
    "we need both the extra assumption @xmath58 and a specific symmetry breaking sector to lift the mass degeneracy @xcite . a stronger symmetry like o(3 )",

    "the higgs doublet giving mass to the up - type quarks is neutral under f. each lepton doublet is charged under a different u(1 ) factor , with the same charge + 1 . in the symmetric phase all neutrinos are exactly massless .",
    "flavour symmetry breaking is obtained by non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of three flavon fields , also charged under a separate u(1 ) factor , with charge -2 . in this way only diagonal neutrino mass terms are induced . if the vevs in the flavon sector are similar , we expect neutrino masses of the same order , and the observed hierarchy between the solar and atmospheric squared mass differences requires a modest adjustment of the flavon vev s and/or of the coefficients of the lepton violating operators",

    "we assume a diagonal mass matrix for the extra fields . we expect @xmath88 and in this regime there are heavy fermions that can be integrated out to produce a low - energy effective lagrangian .",
    "the heavy combinations are @xmath89 and l_a+ l_j  ( a=1, ...",
    "[ heavy ] these fields are set to zero by the equations of motion in the static limit and we should express all remaining fermions in term of the three combinations that are orthogonal to those in eq .",

    "it is sufficient to work in the regime @xmath90 and expand the relevant quantities at first order in @xmath91 . to this approximation",

    "the effective lagrangian reads : = kinetic  terms + ( _ ij- )   e^c_i l_j h_d + h.c .",
    ", [ lagr ] and the mass matrix for the charged leptons is : m_e = h_d(_ij- )  .",
    "this result is analogous to what obtained in the neutrino sector from the see - saw mechanism .",
    "there is a term in @xmath14 coming from the exchange of the heavy fields @xmath81 , which play the role of the right - handed neutrinos , and there is another term that comes from a single operator and that can not be interpreted as due to the exchange of heavy modes . in the regime @xmath93 the `` see - saw '' contribution dominates .",
    "moreover , if the lower left block in @xmath14 is dominated by a single exchange , for instance by @xmath94 , then =  , and the condition of vanishing determinant in eq .",
    "( [ det0 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "additional vector - like leptons are required by several extensions of the standard model .",
    "for instance , a grand unified theory based on the e@xmath95 gauge symmetry group with three generations of matter fields described by three 27 representations of e@xmath95 , includes , beyond the standard model fermions , two su(5 ) singlets and an su(5 ) vector - like @xmath96 pair per each generation .",
    "in such a model a `` see - saw '' mechanism induced by the exchange of heavy @xmath96 fields is not an option , but a necessary ingredient to recover the correct number of light degrees of freedom .",
    "we should still show that it is possible to combine the above conditions in a natural and consistent framework . in the appendix a we present , as an existence proof , a supersymmetric su(5 ) grand unified model possessing a flavour symmetry f = u(1)@xmath97u(1)@xmath59u(1)@xmath60u(1)@xmath98 .",
    "the first u(1)@xmath99 factor is responsible for the hierarchy of masses and mixing angles in the up - type quark sector as well as for the hierarchy between the rows in the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "the remaining part of f guarantees a diagonal neutrino mass matrix and , at the same time , dominance of a single heavy @xmath96 pair in the lower left block of @xmath14 .",
    "notice that , at variance with most of the other existing models @xcite , this framework predicts a small value for @xmath6 , of order @xmath66 which is at the border of sensitivity of future neutrino factories .",
    "even when the neutrino mass matrix @xmath7 is not diagonal in the lagrangian basis , the contribution from the charged lepton sector can be relevant or even crucial to reproduce the observed mixing pattern .",
    "an important example arises if the neutrino matrix @xmath7 instead of being taken as nearly diagonal , is instead assumed of a particularly simple form , like for bimixing : u_=  .",
    "[ ubim ] this configuration can be obtained , for instance , in inverse hierarchy models with a @xmath100 u(1 ) symmetry , which predicts maximal @xmath101 , large @xmath102 , vanishing @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "after the breaking of this symmetry , the degeneracy between the first two neutrino generations is lifted and the small observed value of @xmath105 can be easily reproduced . due to the small symmetry breaking parameters , the mixing angles in eq .",
    "( [ ubim ] ) also receive corrections , whose magnitude turns out @xcite to be controlled by @xmath106 : @xmath107 .",
    "these corrections are too small to account for the measured value of the solar angle .",
    "thus , an important contribution from @xmath2 is necessary to reconcile bimixing with observation .    in this section",
    "we will reconsider the question of whether the observed pattern can result from the corrections induced by the charged lepton sector .",
    "though not automatic , this appears to be at present a rather natural possibility @xcite - see also the recent detailed analysis of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate the impact of planned experimental improvements , in particular those on @xmath108 , on bimixing models . to this purpose",
    "it is useful to adopt a convenient parametrization of mixing angles and phases .",
    "let us define u  =   ( ) ( ) ( )  , [ ufi ] where all the mixing angles belong to the first quadrant and @xmath109 to @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the standard parameterization for @xmath0 reads : @xmath111 a diagonal @xmath112 matrix accounting for the two majorana phases of neutrinos ( the overall phase is not physical ) .",
    "since in the following discussion we are not interested in the majorana phases , we will focus our attention on @xmath113 .",
    "it would be appealing to take the parameterization ( [ ufi ] ) separately for @xmath2 and @xmath7 , by writing @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 etc to distinguish the mixings of the @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 matrices , respectively .",
    "however , as discussed in the appendix b , even disregarding majorana phases , @xmath0 is not just determined in terms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with the latter defined to be of the form ( [ ufi ] ) .",
    "the reason is that , by means of field redefinitions @xmath2 and @xmath7 can be separately but _ not simultaneously _ written respectively as @xmath117 and @xmath119 a diagonal @xmath112 matrix . without loss of generality we can adopt the following form for @xmath0 : u = u_e^u_= _ = |u [ ugen ] where @xmath117 , @xmath118 have the form ( [ ufi ] ) , the phases @xmath120 , @xmath121 run from @xmath122 to @xmath123 and we have introduced two minus signs in the diagonal matrix for later convenience .",
    "this expression for @xmath124 is not due to the majorana nature of neutrinos and a similar result would also hold for quarks .",
    "more technical details on the parametrization ( [ ugen ] ) can be found in the appendix b.    assume now that @xmath118 corresponds to bimixing : @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "clearly , our discussion holds true irrespectively of the light neutrino spectrum .",
    "it is anyway instructive to explicitate the mass matrices , e.g. in the case of inverted hierarchy m_= ( )  , m_e= v_e ( ) [ ] where we have set @xmath128 since , as already mentioned , the corrections induced by setting it to the measured value are negligible in the present discussion .",
    "we then expand @xmath124 of eq .",
