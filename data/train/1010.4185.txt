    "the mller scattering measurements are not only one of the oldest and the best - established tools of modern physics , but also a clean , powerful probe of new physics ( np ) effects  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the significant interest to this process from both theoretical and experimental communities has been re - ignited by two precision experiments : e-158  @xcite at slac , which made the first observation of parity violation in electron - electron scattering , and moller experiment planned at jlab @xcite .",
    "both are dedicated to measuring the parity - violating ( pv ) asymmetry in the @xmath0 scattering at low energies .",
    "the moller experiment aims to measure the pv asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons off unpolarized electrons with a combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of 36 parts per billion  @xcite . with the estimated systematic contribution of 1%",
    ", the measurement will still be statistics - limited , and further improvements in precision might be possible with additional running time .",
    "the measurement of the electron s weak charge @xmath1 with a 2.3% accuracy planned by moller would yield the most precise single measurement of the weak mixing angle @xmath2 , with a fractional accuracy of 0.1% , at an average momentum transfer @xmath3 . at this precision ,",
    "moller can shed light on the discrepancy between the hadronic and leptonic determinations of @xmath2 at the @xmath4-boson pole .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the values of @xmath2 determined at the @xmath4-boson pole and at low @xmath5 is sensitive to the np effects at tev scales .    before physics of interest",
    "can be extracted from the experimental data , radiative effects must be carefully treated .",
    "moller s stated precision goal is significantly more ambitious than that of its predecessor e-158 , so very precise theoretical input for this measurement will be crucial . in spite of significant earlier theoretical effort dedicated to calculations of electroweak radiative corrections ( ewc ) ( see the early review papers @xcite and @xcite , more recent @xcite and @xcite , and numerous additional references in our paper @xcite ) , we believe that a new level of accuracy is required for the next - generation , high - precision experiments . to match the expected experimental systematic uncertainty , it is desirable to keep the theoretical uncertainty due to the radiative corrections at or below the @xmath6 level . obviously , calculating large sets of one - loop feynman diagrams by hand is a tedious task .",
    "recently , program packages such as feynarts @xcite , formcalc @xcite , looptools @xcite and form @xcite have created the possibility of handling the substantial number of diagrams reasonably quickly , minimizing probability of human errors , and preventing the rapid error accumulation often unavoidable with purely numerical methods .",
    "one of the key features of the presented work is to compare , step by step , the complete one - loop set of ewc to the pv moller scattering asymmetry calculated first by hand and then with feynarts , formcalc and looptools as base languages using two different renormalization conditions .",
    "feynarts is a mathematica package which provides the generation and visualization of feynman diagrams and amplitudes involving standard model particles .",
    "formcalc , a mathematica package , reads diagrams generated with feynarts and evaluates amplitudes with the help of the program form in analytical form .",
    "form , a successor to schoonschip @xcite , is a symbolic manipulation system which is also essential for our computer algebra - based method , and is used by formcalc as a core program .",
    "looptools provides the many - point tensor coefficient functions and is used to numerically evaluate scalar and tensor one - loop integrals . in formcalc , it is possible for the regularization to be done either by dimensional reduction or by the usual dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "after that , one may implement one of the two renormalization schemes ( rs ) , the on - shell scheme or the constrained differential renormalization ( cdr)scheme . for calculations done at the one - loop level , the cdr scheme is equivalent to regularization done by dimensional reduction in the @xmath7 scheme with redefined scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the renormalization scales in the cdr and in the dimensional regularization method , respectively @xcite .",
    "a complete automatization would limit the range of applications , so these packages are not `` black box '' ; they require considerable human input on many stages .",
    "we call our approach based on feynarts , formcalc , looptools , and form `` semi - automated '' . on the other hand , these packages allow modifications to better suit specific projects .",
    "in @xcite , for example , we adopted feynarts and formcalc for the nlo calculations of the differential cross section in electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "in general , the results obtained with these packages can be presented in both analytical and numerical form . however , our equations for the ewc to the scattering asymmetry obtained with feynarts and formcalc are too lengthy and cumbersome , so we present only approximate equations obtained by hand . however , as we show in the numerical analysis section , the agreement between numerical results obtained with the two methods  `` by hand '' and",
    "semi - automatic  is excellent .",
    "an additional way to ensure that our nlo ewc calculations are perfectly correct is the detailed comparison of results calculated with different renormalization conditions within the same scheme .",
    "of course , the sum of all radiative corrections forming a full gauge - invariant set must be independent on the choice of renormalization conditions .",
    "paper @xcite , for example , clearly demonstrated the cancellation of gauge dependencies in one - loop corrections from self - energies , tadpoles , vertex and box diagrams to physical amplitudes for four - fermion processes .",
    "however , the agreement between the results evaluated in different renormalization schemes can be guaranteed only if we take into account all orders of perturbation expansion , not just nlo . since in this article",
    "we are only dealing with one - loop corrections , we do not expect the results produced in different schemes to be identical .",
    "in fact , the difference we see between the results obtained with the on - shell and cdr schemes indicates the need to consider higher - order corrections .",
    "a detailed discussion was given in @xcite , for example .",
    "the nnlo corrections will be our next task .",
    "for now , we concentrate on achieving the best accuracy possible in one selected scheme and perform nlo calculations using two methods and two sets of renormalization conditions . for that",
    ", we choose the on - shell renormalization scheme with two different sets of renormalization conditions , the approach proposed by w.  hollik in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the approach suggested by a.  denner in @xcite . for brevity , we will call hollik s renormalization conditions hrc and denner s conditions drc .",
    "it is obvious that any renormalization scheme is required to meet physical conditions , although it is possible to vary renormalization conditions for the sake of simplicity of the problem and still keep the final gauge invariant results unchanged . as a result , contributions to the cross section coming from the different non - gauge invariant loop corrections ( self - energies and vertex corrections ) could vary greatly depending on the choice of renormalization conditions .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to calculate the full set of one - loop ewc , both numerically with no simplifications using semi - automatic approach , and `` by hand '' , analytically in a compact asymptotic form @xcite , and compare the results .",
    "our second goal is to present comparison and analysis of the various contributions to the cross - section asymmetry calculated within the hrc and drc renormalization conditions .",
    "our third aim is to calculate the total nlo corrections in the cdr scheme and estimate the importance of the nnlo corrections for such high - precision experiments as moller .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we provide details of the basic notation , the lowest - order ( born or leading order ( lo ) ) and nlo contributions to mller scattering .",
    "the same section gives a short description of photon emission which is essential for removal of nonphysical parameters from regularized infrared divergent cross section .",
    "the details of the hrc and drc renormalization conditions and a discussion of gauge invariance can be found in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "analysis of analytical and numerical results in the on - shell rs using hrc and drc renormalization conditions is given in the beginning of section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "later , in the same section , the cdr results are discussed .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] includes the analysis of possible effects of an additional new - physics massive neutral boson on the observable asymmetry .",
    "our conclusions and future plans are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the standard model , the born cross section for mller scattering with the longitudinally - polarized electrons @xmath11 can be represented in the form @xmath12 , \\label{cs0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the scattering angle of the detected electron with momentum @xmath15 in the center of mass system of the initial electrons .",
    "the set of momenta of initial ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and final ( @xmath15 and @xmath18 ) electrons ( see fig .  [ born ] ) generates the standard set of mandelstam variables , @xmath19 we neglect the electron mass @xmath20 whenever possible and in particular when @xmath21 .",
    "a useful structure we employ in this paper is @xmath22 which depends on the @xmath4-boson mass @xmath23 or on the photon mass @xmath24 .",
    "the photon mass is set to zero everywhere with the exception of specially indicated cases where the photon mass is taken to be an infinitesimal parameter that regularizes an infrared divergence .",
    "in addition , we use the functions @xmath25 which are combinations of coupling constants and the degrees of polarizations @xmath26 of the electrons with momentum @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) given by @xmath27 @xmath28 here , vector and axial - vector parts of the couplings have the following structure @xmath29 it should be recalled that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the sine ( cosine ) of the weinberg mixing angle which is defined in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 according to the rules of the standard model ( sm ) : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the electron degrees of polarization @xmath26 are labeled such that the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to the values of @xmath26 = @xmath38 and @xmath26 = @xmath39 respectively . here",
    ", the first subscript indicates the degree of polarization for the momentum @xmath16 , while the second indicates the degree of polarization for the momentum @xmath17 . combining the degrees of electron beam polarizations ,",
    "we can obtain four measurable cross sections .",
    "however by the virtue of the rotational invariance , two of them are identical : @xmath40 .",
    "the three polarization cross sections can be used to construct three independent asymmetries @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us is the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath41 which is defined as follows @xmath42 this single - polarization asymmetry corresponding to the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons is proportional to the combination @xmath43 , and is therefore highly sensitive to small changes in @xmath44 .",
    "that is why the asymmetry @xmath41 was used as the observable in e-158 and will be measured in the future moller experiment . at low energies and at born level , the pv asymmetry @xmath45 is given by @xmath46    the contribution of virtual particles ( @xmath47-contribution ) to the cross section of mller scattering is described by the three classes of diagrams : boson self - energies ( bse ) ( they include @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 self - energies and are shown symbolically in fig .  [ 2f](a ) ) , vertex functions ( fig .  [ 2f](b ) and [ 2f](c ) ) , and two - boson exchange diagrams ( boxes ) shown in fig .  [ 2f](d , e ) . in the on - shell and cdr renormalization schemes there is no contribution from the electron self - energies .",
    "the corresponding cross section is given by the sum @xmath51 the detailed expressions for all the terms in this sum were given in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "contributions coming from the vertex correction graphs ( with a photon in the loop ) , as well as the @xmath48 and @xmath49 boxes suffer from the well - known infrared divergence .",
    "regularization of this divergence can be done by giving the photon a small unphysical mass @xmath52 .",
    "obviously , the final result should be free of unphysical parameters and hence such dependence has to be removed . that can be done if we consider additional contributions associated with photon emission diagrams ( bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "the detailed description of this contribution is also given in @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cross section can be broken down into two parts ( soft and hard ) as @xmath53 by separating the integration domain according to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the photon energy ( in the reference frame co - moving with the center of mass of the primary electrons ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 corresponds to the maximum of the emitted soft - photon energy .",
    "first , we follow the methods of paper @xcite to get a well - known result ( see also @xcite ) for the soft - photon cross section ( where @xmath58 is the base of the natural logarithm ) : @xmath59    next , we sum the ir - terms of @xmath47- and @xmath37-contributions , @xmath60 and get a result which is free of regularization parameter @xmath52 .    at this point",
    "let us continue with the discussion of the details of renormalization conditions we use in our calculations .",
    "to obtain the ultraviolet - finite result and render the parameters of the standard model real , we have to apply a renormalization procedure . for a gauge - invariant set",
    ", physical results should be invariant under different renormalization conditions .",
    "that is , although the contributions of the different types of diagrams can vary strongly for different renormalization conditions , the total impact of all one - loop virtual effects on observable quantities must remain independent . in other words ,",
    "the contributions of separate self - energies and vertex correction functions strongly depend on the details of the renormalization conditions , and to properly account of the ewc they should be taken as one gauge - independent set .",
    "we will illustrate this for the case of the observable @xmath41 , which is especially sensitive to the renormalization conditions .",
    "in addition , we can verify that our results are correct by comparing the computer - based ( drc ) and `` by hand '' ( hrc ) calculations .",
    "we now briefly describe our two chosen renormalization conditions , drc and hrc , within the on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "both use multiplicative renormalization constants , and as a result the electroweak lagrangian , originally written in terms of bare parameters , is separated into a basic lagrangian and a counterterm lagrangian .",
    "the basic lagrangian has the same form as the bare one , but depends on renormalized parameters and fields .",
    "the counterterm lagrangian depends on renormalization constants of masses , charges and fields .",
    "renormalization constants are fixed by the renormalization conditions , which are separated into two classes : the first determines the renormalization of the parameters , and the second fixes the renormalization of fields .",
    "the first class is related to physical observables at a given order of perturbation theory , and the second one is related to the green s functions and has no effect on calculations of @xmath61-matrix elements .",
    "both approaches use essentially the same renormalization conditions to fix the parameters of the sm in the following way : @xmath62    here , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the real parts of the truncated , transverse renormalized boson self - energy and electron vertex correction graphs , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal parts of the boson self - energy make very small contributions and are not considered here .",
    "the first condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh1 ] ) fixes the mass renormalization of the @xmath65- , @xmath4-bosons and fermions without quark mixing .",
    "the second condition fixes the renormalization of electric charge , and is derived from the thomson limit when momentum transfer @xmath66 and external electrons are on their mass shell . as for the renormalization conditions of the fields , both approaches are quite different .",
    "in hrc , field renormalization constants are determined from the following conditions : @xmath67 however , in the drc renormalization conditions , the field renormalization is defined on - shell , as it was done for renormalization of the sm parameters .",
    "this explicitly introduces an additional set of conditions , besides eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh2 ] ) , which read : @xmath68 as a result , in drc , renormalization constants for the fields of vector bosons are calculated in a relatively simple way , without the mass - renormalization constants : @xmath69 they can be presented through truncated and non - renormalized self - energy graphs . in comparison with hrc , where the renormalization conditions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh3 ] ) are not present , field renormalization constants are defined in a different way and depend on the mass - renormalization constants : @xmath70 the presence of the mass renormalization constants in the field - renormalization eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh5 ] ) increases the values of the truncated and renormalized self - energy diagrams , and the dominant nlo contributions to the observable cross section come from these diagrams . in drc ,",
    "the mass renormalization constants appear in renormalization constants of the electroweak couplings , and hence we observe comparable contributions coming from both self - energies and vertex corrections .",
    "of course , such a comparison has no physical meaning since neither self - energies nor vertex corrections represent a gauge - invariant set on their own .",
    "as is well known , only the sum of both groups is gauge invariant ; later we show that both approaches give exactly the same results for the observable asymmetry .",
    "we would like to highlight that it is important to exercise caution when comparing separate contributions arising from the different renormalization conditions .",
    "this point is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] ,  [ gr2 ] and  [ gr2b ] , where one can see various renormalized vector boson self - energies calculated with both drc and hrc .",
    "let us note that the same renormalization conditions are imposed on the electromagnetic field . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] , which shows the truncated and renormalized @xmath48 self - energies , there is no difference whatsoever between the two sets of conditions .",
    "the situation is quite different if we look at the results for the truncated and renormalized @xmath50 , @xmath49 and @xmath71 self - energies . in fig .",
    "[ gr2 ] and  [ gr2b ] , we can see a substantial difference in the results obtained within the two sets of renormalization conditions , where the drc set systematically leads to the self - energies being smaller in magnitude . as a result , with drc ,",
    "the self - energy contributions to mller asymmetry are roughly a factor of two smaller in value compared to the values given by hrc .",
    "however , adding the drc vertex corrections restores the total correction obtained with drc to within 0.001% of the hrc result at all energies relevant to the planned moller experiment at jlab .",
    "now we are ready to proceed to the analysis of the results .",
    "section  [ sec41 ] is done in a manner independent of the renormalization conditions , and all notations that follow below can be applied to both drc and hrc of the on - shell scheme .",
    "for the numerical analysis , we use @xmath72 ,   @xmath73 ,   and @xmath74 according to @xcite , take electron , muon , and @xmath75-lepton masses as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and quark masses for loop contributions as @xmath79 ,  @xmath80 ,  @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,  @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . the light quark masses provide @xmath85=0.02757 @xcite , where @xmath86 @xmath87 is the electric charge of fermion @xmath88 in proton charge units @xmath89 .",
    "we can see that the use of the light quark masses as parameters regulated by the hadronic vacuum polarization is a better choice in this case .",
    "we checked that variations of the light quark masses around the outlined values have a negligible impact on the values of the polarization asymmetry , so the choice of quark masses does not introduce a significant uncertainty to our results .",
    "an earlier work by @xcite , relevant to observables measured at very low momentum transfers , which determined the weak mixing angle in the @xmath7-scheme , also argued that the uncertainty from non - perturbative hadronic contributions is small compared to anticipated experimental uncertainties .",
    "although @xcite argued that the most significant source of theoretical uncertainty on scattering asymmetry comes from the hadronic contributions to the @xmath49 vacuum polarization , we find that in our calculations hadronic contributions are under good control . finally , for the mass of the higgs boson",
    ", we take @xmath90 .",
    "although this mass is still to be determined experimentally , the dependence of the ewc on @xmath91 is rather weak .",
    "let us determine the physical impact of this contribution to the observable @xmath41 , by defining the relative corrections to the born asymmetry as @xmath92 where the index c stands for a specific contribution , for example @xmath93 .",
    "let indicies @xmath94se , @xmath49se and @xmath4se denote @xmath48- , @xmath49- , and @xmath50-bse contributions , respectively .",
    "the main subject of the following analysis is `` _ weak _ '' relative corrections , which are defined as all bse contributions ( including the @xmath48-se which is not weak by nature , but is needed here to account for all ir - finite contributions to the asymmetry ) plus heavy vertex ( hv ) contributions ( `` heavy '' means `` massive '' , i.e. @xmath4- or @xmath65-boson ) , @xmath50- and @xmath71-boxes . in summary :",

    "the reason we evaluate nlo ewc in cdr is to obtain some indication of the size of the higher - order effects ( nnlo and beyond ) to see if there is enough motivation to do these very involved calculations in the future .    in fig .",
    "[ sverka - xs - cdr ] , we can see the relative total correction @xmath158 to the unpolarized cross section versus @xmath159 at @xmath14 = 90@xmath160 for different rs : on - shell and cdr .",
    "in the region of small energies , the difference between the two schemes is almost constant and rather small ( @xmath149 ) , but grows at @xmath161 .",
    "it is well known that in the region of small energies , the correction to the cross section is dominated by the qed contribution .",
    "however , in the high - energy region the weak correction becomes comparable to qed .",
    "since the difference between the on - shell and cdr results grows substantially as the weak correction becomes larger , it is clear that for an observable such as the pv asymmetry the difference between the on - shell and cdr schemes will be sizeable for the entire spectrum of energies @xmath162  gev .",
    "because of that , we expect that the nnlo correction to the pv asymmetry may become important to pv precision physics in the future .",
    "[ sverka - as - cdr ] shows the relative _ weak _ ( lower lines ) , and qed ( upper lines ) corrections to the born asymmetry @xmath45 versus @xmath159 at @xmath14 = 90@xmath163 .",
    "the difference is significant and is growing with increasing @xmath159 . according to our calculations for @xmath164 = 11 gev , @xmath57 = 0.05",
    "@xmath159 and @xmath14 = 90@xmath163 , the total radiative correction to pv asymmetry is @xmath165% with on - shell and @xmath166% with cdr .",
    "the difference is not at all surprising . for e-158 , for example",
    ", the one - loop weak corrections were found to be about @xmath167% in the @xmath7 scheme @xcite and about @xmath168% in the on - shell scheme @xcite .",
    "the physical , nlo - corrected asymmetries , computed in both on - shell and cdr schemes , are compared in fig .",
    "[ sverka - hat ] . here , for consistency with the @xmath169 definition of the couplings to @xmath170  @xcite",
    ", we use @xmath171  @xcite in the expression of the born asymmetry .",
    "we find that the predictions for the physical pv asymmetry , computed to the same order in perturbation theory in two different schemes , differ by about 3% .",
    "the difference is an indication of the order of magnitude the higher - order , nnlo and beyond , terms .",
    "the @xcite estimated that the higher - order corrections are suppressed by @xmath172 relative to the one - loop result , possibly 5% in some cases , and thus are not significant source of uncertainty .",
    "however , we conclude that although the corrections at the nnlo level were not mandated by the previously achievable experimental precision , they may become important for the next generation of experiments .",
    "let us now add a very simple np assumption to our sm calculations and show how this np contribution affects the observable asymmetry .",
    "the reason we want to do it in here is to investigate if the two complimentary methods we used in the previous sections , `` by - hand '' and semi - automated , can be applied in the np domain .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , feynarts , formcalc , looptools , and form are not `` black box '' programs and can be modified for specific projects , including adding the np sector . as was already concluded in @xcite and @xcite , the proposed moller measurement could be influenced by radiative loop effects of new - physics particles .",
    "this type of calculation is out of scope of this paper , but we plan to provide a full estimation in our future publication . for",
    "now , we assume that there is just one additional neutral boson ( anb ) , or @xmath173-boson , with the usual @xmath174 structure of interaction with fermions , vector(axial ) coupling constants @xmath175 and mass @xmath176 . from the analysis done in the previous section",
    ", we can clearly see that in the low - energy region where @xmath177 , contributions are mainly suppressed by propagator factors like @xmath178 . in this section ,",
    "our goal is to analyze the contribution of @xmath173-born and @xmath179-box diagrams to the observable scattering asymmetry for moller experiment .",
    "the only significant contribution to the born asymmetry comes from the interference terms from the @xmath173 and photon diagrams .",
    "the relative correction to the born asymmetry coming from @xmath173-boson is additive , and is given by @xmath180    according to @xcite , the goal of moller is to measure the pv asymmetry to a precision of @xmath181 ( 0.73 ppb ) . with this uncertainty , and assuming the identical coupling constants for @xmath4 and @xmath173 , it should be possible to detect anb with a mass up to @xmath182 . the sensitivity of moller to @xmath173 increases if its parity - violating couplings are larger than those of @xmath183 , making the measurements of pv complementary to the direct searches at high energies .",
    "the one - loop diagrams including anb give significantly smaller contributions .",
    "as an example , let us consider @xmath179-box .",
    "as before , we perform our calculations by both approximate ( `` by - hand '' ) and exact ( with feynarts and formcalc ) methods , and get an excellent agreement .",
    "the expressions derived as a result of our approximate approach are presented below .    for the @xmath179-box contribution , the cross section can be expressed by the following short equation : @xmath184 + ( z \\leftrightarrow z ' ) , \\label{zzp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath185 and the functions @xmath186 are expressed through @xmath187 to obtain @xmath36 , we calculate the master scalar integral : @xmath188    according to the methods described in section  [ sec41 ] , we can now calculate the relative correction to the observable asymmetry from the anb contribution ( i.e. from @xmath179-box ) @xmath189 as : @xmath190 this correction is additive and becomes less important with increasing @xmath176 . however , this suppression is not very dramatic due to the growing log in the numerator . if we take the moller kinematics and assume that @xmath191 , then for @xmath192 the correction is twice the contribution from @xmath50-box : @xmath193 .",
    "as @xmath194 grows , the correction decreases : at @xmath195 the correction is @xmath196 , and for @xmath197 the correction is @xmath198 . at @xmath199 ,",
    "the correction becomes completely negligible : @xmath200 .",
    "however , the possible contributions of new - physics particles to the mller scattering deserves further attention , and we intend to continue our work in this direction .",
    "one of the simplest supersymmetric sm extensions is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and it gives a useful framework for discussing susy phenomenology . for @xmath201 scattering ,",
    "mssm contributions will arise at the one - loop order , and the large suppression of the sm weak charge makes the weak charge sensitive to the effects of new physics . according to @xcite",
    ", the loop corrections in the mssm can be as large as @xmath202 for the weak charge of the proton and @xmath203 for the weak charge of the electron , which is close to the current level of experimental and theoretical precision available for the low - energy studies .",
    "obviously , before we can interpret these high - precision scattering experiments in terms of possible new physics , it is crucial to have the sm ewc under a very firm control .",
    "in the presented work , we perform detailed calculations of the complete one - loop set of electroweak radiative corrections to the parity violating @xmath204 scattering asymmetry both at low and high energies using the on - shell renormalization conditions proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the conditions suggested in @xcite .",
    "although contributions from the self - energies and vertex diagrams calculated with the two sets of renormalization conditions differ significantly , our full gauge - invariant set still guarantees that the total relative weak corrections are in excellent agreement for the two methods of calculation .",
    "obviously , it is important to exercise caution when comparing separate contributions arising from the different renormalization conditions unless these contributions form a gauge - invariant set ( like boxes ) . although this is a well - known fact in principle , it is still useful to demonstrate this in detail numerically for a specific example .",
    "we hope that our results illustrating the structure of relative weak corrections evaluated at different renormalization conditions will be of educational value to researchers staring work in this area .",
    "in addition , we compare the asymptotic results obtained analytically , `` by hand '' ( with hrc ) , with some approximations , and semi - automatically ( with drc ) , with no approximations required . as a result",
    ", we have a good agreement for the whole @xmath205  gev energy region .",
    "more specifically , for the kinematics relevant to the 11 gev moller experiment planned at jlab , our agreement within two approaches for the complete one - loop set of electroweak radiative corrections is better than 0.1% .",
    "we found no significant theoretical uncertainty coming from the largest possible source , the hadronic contributions to the vacuum polarization .",
    "the dependence on other uncertain input parameters , like the mass of the higgs boson , is extremely weak and well below 0.1% .",
    "we conclude that the excellent agreement we obtained between the results calculated `` by hand '' and semi - automatically serves as a good illustration of opportunities offered by feynarts , formcalc , looptools , and form .",
    "considering the large size of the obtained radiative effects , it is obvious that the careful procedure for taking into account radiative correction is essential .",
    "our plans include the construction of a monte carlo generator for the simulation of radiative events within mller scattering to make our work directly useful to the experiment . since we are now assured of the reliability of our calculations , we plan to base this monte carlo on the maximum - precision results from our semi - automatic approach .",
    "although making sure that the results obtained by two different approaches using two renormalization conditions are identical assures us that our nlo ewc calculations are error - free , it does not address the question of the size of nnlo corrections .",
    "the two - loop corrections are beyond the scope of this work , but we plan to address them in the future . one way to find",
    "some indication of the size of higher - order contributions is to compare physical observables computed to the same order in perturbation theory in different renormalization schemes .",
    "our calculations in the on - shell and cdr schemes show that while the nlo terms differ by about 11% , the pv asymmetries differ by about 3% . at the level of precision of the future experiments such as moller , higher - order corrections become important .    to see if the two complimentary approaches we successfully used for the sm calculations can be applied in the np domain , we expanded feynarts , formcalc , looptools , and form to include an additional neutral boson ( @xmath173 ) , calculated the relevant correction , and then obtained the same result by hand .",
    "possible other contributions of new - physics particles to the mller asymmetry still need to be investigated , and many of them can be included into the program packages mentioned above .",
    "we believe that the future experiments at jlab and the ilc will mandate evaluation of the ewc beyond one loop .",
    "once all the sm corrections are under control , it is worth considering nlo corrections including new - physics particles , starting with the minimal super symmetric model ( mssm ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to address these corrections is by employing the cdr scheme @xcite , @xcite because the cdr approach can be easily expanded to mssm .",
    "however , whether the cdr scheme will be applicable in evaluating the ewc at the nnlo level is still an open question .",
    "our preliminary plan is to address the nnlo ewc with the on - shell scheme first , and if the effect is significant , stay with the same scheme for calculating contributions coming from the new - physics particles .",
    "the simple example of the @xmath179-box we consider in section  [ sec5 ] is gauge - invariant and is thus not affected by the choice of renormalization , but we have to be careful when choosing the scheme for our future work . any suggestions from the community regarding the best approach to this task would be greatly appreciated .",
