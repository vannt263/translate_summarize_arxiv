    "brown dwarfs may be thought of as failed stars . these low mass ( @xmath170 m@xmath2 @xcite ) , cool objects are the lowest mass objects that the star formation process can produce .",
    "the majority of the brown dwarfs that have been discovered to date are field objects discovered using surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite , see @xcite for examples ) , the deep near - infrared sky survey ( denis ; @xcite , see @xcite for examples ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss;@xcite see @xcite for examples ) and the ukirt deep infrared sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite , see @xcite for examples )",
    ". however , to study brown dwarfs in depth , a knowledge of their age is essential , which means we must study brown dwarfs in open star clusters or moving groups .",
    "once a brown dwarf has been proved to belong to an open star cluster , or a moving group , then the age of the dwarf is known , allowing meaningful comparisons to evolutionary models to be made .",
    "the most recent example of this is the study done by @xcite who used existing proper motions and parallax measurements to show that a selection of field dwarfs in fact belong to the ursa major and hyades moving groups .",
    "the importance of this study , is that these are the first brown dwarfs to be associated with an older cluster or group .",
    "older clusters such as the hyades are expected to contain very few or no brown dwarfs or low mass members , due to the dynamical evolution of the cluster over time @xcite .",
    "however , these escaped low mass objects may remain members of the much larger moving group that surrounds the cluster .    to continue",
    "the study started by @xcite , proper motions need to be measured for the majority of the field brown dwarfs currently known .",
    "this has been accomplished using the wide field camera ( wfcam , @xcite ) of the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . using these wfcam images and existing data",
    "we have measured proper motions for 143 l and t dwarfs listed in the online dwarf archive .",
    "this proper motion data may be put to a number of uses . taken with measured radial velocities and distances",
    ", it can yield all three components of velocity ( u , v , w ) .",
    "using reduced proper motion diagrams it can be used as an approximate measure of distance .",
    "however we have no radial velocities for these objects .",
    "these proper motion measurements can however also be used to help identify objects as members of a star cluster or members of a moving group via the moving cluster method .",
    "our proper motion data is discussed and listed in section 2 of this paper . from the proper motion measurements , we find 5 new wide common proper motion binaries / multiple systems .",
    "we also identify 8 high velocity l dwarfs , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we suggest that these l dwarfs are probably old and belong to the thick disc or halo population of the galaxy .",
    "this in turn suggests that they are likely to be very faint stars rather than brown dwarfs . finally in section 5",
    "we identify a number of l and t dwarfs that may be members of the hyades , pleiades and ursa major moving groups .",
    "in order to measure proper motions for known l and t dwarfs we observed 143 l and t dwarfs from the dwarfarchive ( detailed in table [ pm ] , see http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/davy/archive/ for discovery references ) with declinations between -30@xmath3 and 60@xmath3 and _ j _ band magnitudes of less than 16.5 .",
    "the images were taken using wfcam on ukirt over the period of february 2006 to august 2006 .",
    "wfcam is a near infrared imager consisting of 4 rockwell hawaii - ii ( hgcdte 2048x2048 ) arrays arranged such that 4 separately pointed observations can be tiled together to cover a filled square of sky covering 0.75 square degrees with 0.4 arcsecond pixels @xcite .",
    "however , as we only required the image of the brown dwarf in question , we only used array 3 which is regarded as the least noisy array .",
    "wfcam is ideal for this work , as the large field of view per chip means there are many other stars in the image , which can be used as astrometric reference stars .",
    "the images were taken in the _ j _ band in non - photometric conditions using exposure times of @xmath05 - 10 minutes and a nine point dither pattern .",
    "these exposure times gave s / n@xmath0100 even in the poor conditions .",
    "the images were reduced at the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) using procedures which have been custom written for the treatment of wfcam data ( irwin et al .",
    ", in preparation , @xcite ) . in brief , each frame was debiased , dark corrected and then flat fielded .",
    "the individual dithered images were stacked before having an object detection routine run on them .",
    "the frames were astrometrically calibrated using point sources in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue .",
    "the accuracy is typically @xmath00.1 ",
    "@xcite the photometric calibration employed by the casu pipeline also relies on 2mass data ( there are typically hundreds of 2mass calibrators per detector ) and is found to be accurate to @xmath02% in good conditions @xcite , however as we wished to measure proper motions , the astrometric calibration was more important than the photometric calibration for these data .",
    "the astrometry for 2mass is good to 80 mas over the whole survey , and to 50 mas over a small area @xcite . because the wfcam astrometry is also calibrated to the 2mass catalogue , accurate relative proper motion measurements",
    "could be calculated simply by taking the difference in 2mass and wfcam positions and dividing by the epoch difference .",
    "we calculated the epoch difference by taking the difference in the julian date as given in the fits header for each image , which is between 5 and 9 years with the average epoch difference being 7.1 years . @xcite",
    "employ a similar method for calculating proper motions using the ukidss galactic cluster survey , also using wfcam and 2mass .",
    "the proper motion measurements for each object in every wfcam image ( i.e. array 3 ) were calculated by this method .",
    "this motion , was then converted into mas yr@xmath4 .",
    "the proper motion has been calculated directly from the ra and dec of the object in question , not from pixel motion on images , hence @xmath5=(@xmath6/@xmath7t)@xmath8  yr@xmath4 if @xmath6 is converted to arcseconds .",
    "these proper motions are relative proper motions , in the sense that they are relative to the bulk of the background stars in the field , which are generally moving slowly enough to be assumed to have zero motion .",
    "however , we checked the reference star motion so that the proper motion of the brown dwarf could be altered if there was a standard offset in the field .",
    "the proper motions were separated in @xmath9 and @xmath10 from -500 to 500 mas yr@xmath4 in each direction , in bins of size 20 mas yr@xmath4 , and the number of objects falling into each bin were totalled .",
    "we then fitted a two dimensional gaussian to the data for each field to determine the spread of the reference stars , as well as the true centre of the motion .",
    "the process was then repeated after the initial fit , rejecting any objects that lay outside 3@xmath11 of the fitted gaussian , before fitting another gaussian to this data .",
    "this fitting was important in some cases as the reference stars had quite a large spread , and in other cases the proper motion of our brown dwarf was of the same order of magnitude as the references .",
    "this is illustrated by figures [ pmplot1 ] and [ pmplot3 ] .",
    "these centroiding error , or the centres of the fit were then subtracted from the calculated proper motion measurements .",
    "@xcite assumed the errors on their proper motions to be @xmath0 10 mas yr@xmath4 , but no formal error calculation was made .",
    "we used the @xmath11 value of the gaussian to determine the error on our measurements .",
    "in general the errors were of the order of @xmath0 15 mas yr@xmath4 .",
    "the quoted errors are the @xmath11 value of the gaussian fitted to the proper motion points for each image .",
    "strictly this should be the @xmath11 plus the position error of the object added in quadrature .",
    "however , the centroiding errors for wfcam are less than 2 mas yr@xmath4 , and so are small compared to the @xmath11 value .",
    "table [ pm ] shows the 2mass name , ra , dec , proper motion and associated errors for the 143 objects studied .",
    "their discovery papers may be found from the dwarfarchive .",
    "all of the objects in table [ pm ] are 2mass objects and are identified by their 2mass name .",
    "hereafter they are referred to as j followed by the first 4 digits , the plus or minus sign , and the next two digits .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have measured the proper motions for 143 dwarfs from the dwarf archive . from these measurements ,",
    "we find 4 new common proper motion wide binary or multiple systems .",
    "we also identify 8 high velocity dwarfs i.e. dwarfs with tangential velocities @xmath12 100 kms@xmath4 .",
    "these dwarfs also have bluer than average _ j_-_k _ colours .",
    "we argue that these are probably thick disc objects with an age of order 10 gyr .",
    "we estimate their luminosities which are @xmath010@xmath13l / l@xmath14 .",
    "this suggests that they are probably very low luminosity stars rather than brown dwarfs .",
    "if so , they may be some of the dimmest stars found to date .",
    "finally we have found 15 l dwarfs that are potential members of the hyades moving group , 5 that are potential members of the ursa major moving group and 5 that are potential members of the pleiades moving group .",
    "the next obvious step towards confirming membership of these groups is to measure parallaxes for these dwarfs .",
    "parallaxes will allow accurate distances to be used to compare with the moving group distance . _",
    "spitzer _ 3.5 , 4.49 , 5.73 and 7.87 micron magnitudes will also be valuable for a fuller understanding of the high velocity metal poor dwarfs .",
    "slc , pdd , sth and nl were supported by pparc for the duration of this work .",

    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "research has benefited from the m , l , and t dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org and maintained by chris gelino , davy kirkpatrick , and adam burgasser .",
