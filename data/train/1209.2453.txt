    "the wavelength solution was modeled by fitting the comparison lamp exposures independently for each spectrum each night . for a given night , the wavelength solutions were stable to within a tenth of an angstrom . because we observed comparison lamp exposures before every spectrum , our wavelength solutions were robust .",
    "thus , we were able to place all images on the same wavelength scale for each observing run ( longslit , identify , reidentify , fitcoords ) .",
    "we used the radial velocity standard star that was moved spatially along the slit to map out the distortion along rows of constant position , and then , we used the comparison lamp exposures to trace the distortion along columns of constant wavelength .",
    "these fitting procedures produced coordinate maps that were then applied to every respective object exposure ( transform ) .",
    "next , we applied a slit function that corrected for the minor illumination drop off at the edges of the slit in the cross - dispersion direction .",

    ", we ensured proper galaxy alignment by over - plotting the spectra and matching the peak flux in individual images . if necessary , a pixel shift was applied to align peaks .",
    "galaxy images from a single night with the same pa were combined into a single spectrum with an algorithm to reject cosmic rays ( imcombine ) . the same combining process , without the shifting procedure ,",

    "a different post - slit filter ( kp 1547 ) was used for the ionized gas , but otherwise , the telescope setup was unchanged .",
    "the kp 1547 filter has a central wavelength of about 5015   and a fwhm of 27  , and was used for targeting the @xmath23   emission feature .",
    "we observed both the major and minor axes .",
    "we took dome flats , twilight flats , and stepped one radial velocity standard star along the slit spatially to correct for the slit distortion and to find the center of the slit in the same fashion as for the other filter , described previously .",
    "additionally , we took th - ar comparison lamp exposures after all object images for accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "we observed three galaxy and three sky positions for the major axis pa , and three galaxy positions for the minor axis .",
    "however , due to threatening clouds during the course of the night , we were only able to observe one sky image for the minor axis .",
    "the sky image was scaled to compensate for the large difference in exposure time . despite the difficulties , the brightness of the emission line made it possible to obtain high signal - to - noise emission line spectra .",

    "instead of approximating all structures as a sum of point sources , this algorithm iteratively fits gaussians to four angular scales of 135@xmath22 , 45@xmath22 , 15@xmath22 , and 0@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the multi - scale cleaning algorithm produces a single data cube in which all observed angular frequencies are properly represented and with near uniform ( gaussian ) noise statistics , which is a great advantage over standard cleaning methods . a beam size of 7@xmath24 x 7@xmath25 ( with a position angle of 16@xmath26 ) and a spectral resolution of 2.6  were achieved .",
    "in order to separate noise from real galaxy emission , we used the natural - weighted cube and smoothed it to a 25@xmath27 25  ( convl ) beam .",
    "we blanked this smoothed cube twice , first for all pixels below @xmath28 of the rms of the smoothed cube ( blank ) , and then again by hand for any additional emission that was clearly noise .",

    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the primary beam is 32@xmath16 , but the largest angular scale of emission that is expected to be recovered by the interferometer is @xmath315@xmath16 , which is determined by the d - array . any smooth structure larger than @xmath315@xmath16 will be invisible to the interferometer .",
    "this was useful in removing foreground milky way hi emission , which has velocities that partly overlap with some of the velocities encountered in ngc 1569 .",
    "in essence , the interferometer is blind for emission from the milky way , and will only register its small  scale structure , which is still considerably more extended than that of ngc 1569 .",

    "we extracted one - dimensional stellar spectra from the two - dimensional spectra of ngc 1569 ( scopy ) .",
    "it was necessary to sum over a series of consecutive rows in the cross - dispersion direction during spectral extraction in order to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) . in the portion of the spectrum that contains the brightest light , from radii 0@xmath22 to -25@xmath22 ( west of center ) measured from the center of the galaxy , which is also where the sscs reside ( shown in figure [ fig:29 ] ) , we summed over five rows , 6@xmath29 of the major axis .",

    "all of the standard stars had s / n above @xmath3 50 , usually near 90 , although this was difficult to measure due to the lack of line - free continuum ( see bottom panel of figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we extracted one - dimensional spectra of the radial velocity standard stars using apall ( see , e.g. , bottom panel of figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we identified the center of the peak emission in each star and fit the background using the spatial regions of the slit that contain no stellar data . in some cases , we used the twilight sky exposures to extract a solar spectrum , which was used in the cross - correlation method ( ccm ) as a g2 v radial velocity standard star .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] identifies the nights that utilized these solar spectra by the @xmath301 added to the number of standard star spectra in column 9 .",
    "once one - dimensional spectra were extracted , we added into the header of each star the @xmath31 radial velocities from the united states nautical almanac ( 2008 ) .",
    "these spectra of radial velocity standard stars are the templates that were used in the ccm .",
    "we fit a cubic spline function to the continuum in the spectra of the galaxy and the template stars ( continuum ) .",
    "the slit width of 2@xmath325 may have caused small telescope tracking errors for some of the template stars because the seeing on most nights was around 1@xmath322 .",
    "however , the exposure times for the standard stars were short , less than a minute for a large portion ( see table [ tab:3 ] ) , so tracking errors do not a play a large role in the total error budget .",
    "we cross - correlated the template stars with each other to test the ccm and to check the observed stars velocities , which was within a few percent of the stars known velocities in most cases ( fxcor ) .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra from the galaxy were cross - correlated with the stellar templates observed during the same night .",
    "we only performed cross - correlations of the stars with stars and stars with galaxy spectra that were obtained on the same night in order to minimize the uncertainties in the observational setup , such as varying position angles .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities and velocity dispersions of the stars in ngc 1569 were determined , for each spectrum , by fitting a single gaussian curve to the peak of the ccm .",
    "we did not explore the possibility of asymmetric gaussian profiles as the quality of our data were not good enough for accurate analysis .",
    "we made the assumption that the stars in ngc 1569 are virialized and the gaussian profiles are symmetric .",
    "we excluded regions around emission line features in order to avoid internal galaxy emission or residuals due to atmospheric emission lines that were not completely removed during the sky subtraction step ( see the top image of figure [ fig:2 ] , which shows residual sky emission lines around 5196.8   and 5199.1  , and the top panel of figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we cross - correlated each template star with each galaxy position and averaged the @xmath31 values by weighting them by the standard deviations of the different template spectra , thus determining the @xmath31 values at each galaxy radius . by weighting the @xmath31 values in this manner ,",
    "an ill - fitting template would not contribute as much to the resulting @xmath31 of the galaxy spectra as a good - fitting template . also , we observed no trend between stellar spectral types or classes when determining a `` good - fitting '' versus an `` ill - fitting '' template in the ccm ; s / n dominated the quality of the fit .    to determine the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the stars , @xmath33 , in ngc 1569 as a function of radius , we employ the definition of a gaussian and correct for instrumental broadening using the following equation : @xmath34 we determine the inherent , average instrumental full - width half - maximum , fwhm@xmath35 = 35 , by cross - correlating the template stars from a single night with each other",
    ". the intrinsic broadening of a single star should be unresolved , so the fwhm@xmath35 of the cross - correlation of the template stars with each other represents the instrumental signature .",
    "although the spectral types and classes of the radial velocity standard stars span a range , our usable wavelength region is only @xmath3 150  , thus cross - correlations of the stars between differing spectral types did not create variations in the resulting fwhm@xmath35 or fwhm@xmath36 above their respective standard deviations .        due to the starburst nature of ngc 1569 , many star forming regions lie throughout the observable disk and create bright features seen along the cross - dispersion direction of these spectra .",

    "we use the newly imaged little things data to determine the maximum rotation , @xmath1 , of the gas for ngc 1569 .",
    "one common method of constructing rotation curves of disk galaxies from high - resolution data is the tilted ring model ( begeman 1989 ) .",
    "the first step in applying this model is to create a two - dimensional velocity field out of a three - dimensional data cube . then , from the extracted velocity map , a series of ring parameters are determined by independently fitting a series of concentric , circular rings in the plane of the disk .",
    "the ring parameters are : inclination of the galaxy disk ( @xmath38 ) ; pa of the major axis ( @xmath39 ) measured east from north ; kinematic center ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) ; systemic velocity ( @xmath10 ) ; expansion velocity in the radial direction of the disk ( @xmath42 ) ; and , finally , the rotational velocity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the ring size and spacing between rings must be fixed and are usually determined using the beam size as the smallest ring radius and ring width . in the tilted ring model ,",
    "these rotational parameters are determined by assuming an axisymmetric thin disk with closed circular orbits and are fit independently to each of the pre - determined rings in succession .    to determine the rotation curve of ngc 1569 we use the gipsy task rotcur , which applies the tilted ring model .",
    "we input the bulk velocity field , described in the following section , along with the rotation parameters derived after eight iterations , which is how many iterations were required for the model to converge .",
    "we used rings that were 8@xmath22 wide ( roughly one beam width ) and separated by 8@xmath22 so that there was no overlap between rings .",
    "our final ring radius was 200@xmath22 because beyond this radius the signal - to - noise dropped drastically .",
    "the final parameters determined from the tilted ring model are as follows : the kinematic center , ( @xmath40 = 04:30:46.125 , @xmath41 = + 64:51:10.25 ) , which is marked by the blue star on figure [ fig:46 ] and differs by 58@xmath22 from the morphological center used for the stellar kinematics ; @xmath38 = 69 @xmath2 7 ; @xmath39 = 122@xmath13 , which is only one degree different from the pa of the major axis used for the stars ; @xmath10 = -85 , which agrees within the error of the systemic velocity derived for the stars ; @xmath42 = 0 .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] lists these final parameter values determined from the tilted ring model .",
    "all velocities for the data are heliocentric velocities , the same velocity reference frame as the stellar data .",
    "ngc 1569 shows a dominance of non - circular and random motions as seen in the intensity - weighted mean velocity field in figure [ fig:34 ] .",

    "nevertheless , we were able to apply the method developed by @xcite to extract bulk rotation from chaotic systems like ngc 1569 .",
    "an iterative double gaussian deconvolution procedure was used to separate velocities of clouds superimposed upon the bulk motion at a given position in the data cube .",
    "the deconvolution program uses only the intensities that are above 2 @xmath19 in the bulk velocity field .",

    "the velocity closest to the model velocity field is assigned to a bulk motion map while the outlying velocity is assigned to one of two non - circular motion maps .",
    "the @xmath44 non - circular motion map contains all velocities that are derived from gaussian peaks that have a @xmath45 intensity than the bulk motion velocity , whereas the reverse is true for the @xmath46 non - circular motion map .",

    "but , it is inconsistent with the value obtained by @xcite , @xmath10 = -104 @xmath2 4 km s@xmath20 , who state that the flux used to derive the velocity is confused with foreground galactic emission .",

    "although the velocities of the stars are quite irregular , we were still able to constrain the inclination of the disk to @xmath52 60@xmath53 and the major axis pa @xmath54 120@xmath55 using a least squares fit . both of these estimates agree well with the results ( see table [ tab:1 ] )",

    "since we have only a few points along each intermediate pa , i.e. , @xmath2 45@xmath13 from the major axis , we focus on the major axis , where @xmath61 and thus , @xmath57 does not contribute to @xmath33 . following swaters ( 1999 ) , we make the assumption that the stellar velocity dispersion in the stars follows the milky way properties observed for stars near the sun . therefore , @xmath33 = @xmath0 for the major axis .",

    "these low velocities of the ionized gas also coincide with the bulk motion of the gas . curiously",
    ", this agreement extends to the peculiar dip to lower velocities at the western edge of the red oval outline .",

    "sscs a and b reside at radii -22@xmath22 and -12@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "due to the lack of and the matching stellar and low velocity ionized gas in the expanding shell region , even including peculiar motions , we conclude that our stellar spectra are dominated by a young , luminous stellar population that are ionizing nearby gas left over from the star formation process . at the same time these young , luminous stars , mostly from ssc a , created the expanding shell from winds and supernova explosions during the most recent star formation episode .",
    "this expanding shell was also observed and discussed by @xcite , who also observed both the low and high velocity ionized gas .",
    "the high velocity ionized gas seen everywhere else is likely the result from outflow from the recent starburst activity @xcite .",
    "we also see evidence of galactic wind at radii greater than @xmath300@xmath22 .",
    "because of the exponential drop in stellar light , the integrated emission from the stars was too faint to extract stellar kinematic information in our optical spectra beyond a radius of @xmath230@xmath22 .",
    "thus , no stellar velocity information is known in the region of the high velocity ionized gas at radii greater than @xmath3030@xmath22 .",
    "the low velocity ionized gas centered at r = @xmath3015@xmath22 in figure [ fig:10 ] also shows matching stellar and gas velocities .",
    "this region , however , has more than the expanding shell centered at @xmath6520@xmath22 .",
    "it is not as obvious here as for the expanding shell centered at r = @xmath6520@xmath22 , but it is possible that the stellar spectra around r = @xmath3015@xmath22 are also dominated by young , luminous stars because they , too , follow the velocities of the low velocity ionized gas and .",

    "figure [ fig:15 ] shows the observed rotation curve .",
    "we find a maximum rotational velocity , @xmath43 , of 33 @xmath2 10 km s@xmath20 , which was calculated from the average of the last nine data points in figure [ fig:15 ] .",

    "the average velocity dispersion is high , @xmath67 = 10 km s@xmath20 , compared to the observed rotation speed , @xmath43 = 33 @xmath2 10 km s@xmath20 . because of the high velocity dispersions in ngc 1569 , we correct the observed rotation velocities for asymmetric drift in the same manner as @xcite , and derive the curve shown by the filled circles in figure [ fig:50 ] .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity determined from , increased from the observed @xmath43 = 33 km s@xmath20 to @xmath1 = 50 km s@xmath20 after the asymmetric drift correction was applied .",

    "we define `` forbidden '' as motion that does not follow the ordered rotation .",
    "along the major axis in figure [ fig:25 ] , we show a black curve that traces the average velocities of the contours from 0@xmath16 to 2@xmath16 , which is the region of the diagram that follows the ordered motion of the gas .",
    "this black curve is then reflected through the origin to show what the expected ordered motion should be from -2@xmath16 to 0@xmath16 . at some positions between distances of 0@xmath16 and -0@xmath69 from the galaxy center , the stellar velocities follow the velocity trend of the forbidden motion , whereas at other positions around -0@xmath70 , the stellar velocities follow the ordered rotation of the disk .",
    "could the gas and stars be showing evidence of counter - rotation ?",
    "if this were the case , then we would expect contours in the lower left quadrant of all the panels of figure [ fig:25 ] , which we do not observe .",
    "therefore , we identify the forbidden motion as the northeastern tip of the ncm cloud identified in figure [ fig : cartoon ] and by the black oval in figure [ fig:13 ] . the major axis , pa = 122@xmath13 ( shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] and by the black line throughout figure [ fig:13 ] ) , slices through the tip of the ncm cloud .",
    "the velocities of this cloud in the strong non - circular motion map , panel ( b ) of figure [ fig:13 ] , match the velocities of the contours of the forbidden in figure [ fig:25 ] .",
    "the ncm cloud has similar velocity structure and position as hv3 in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the stars and gas are not counter - rotating but , there is evidence of a kinematic disturbance .",
    "when the stellar velocities are laid on top of an optical image , we can physically see the areas in the galaxy that correspond to observed stellar kinematic features .",
    "figure [ fig:29 ] shows the _ hst _ image in greyscale .",
    "red and blue ovals are superimposed on the picture , representing the positions of the extracted spectra along the major axis .",
    "the length of each oval represents the angular area of the slit that we summed , while the width of the ovals represents the 2@xmath17 slit width .",
    "red and blue ovals represent red- and blue - shifted @xmath31 radial velocities , respectively , relative to the systemic velocity of ngc 1569 .",
    "each of the ovals are representative of independent data points from spectra taken on different nights . therefore , there are some red- and blue - shifted velocities shown at the same positions .",
    "the green ` x ' marks the center of the slit and the center of the galaxy .    in the region west of ssc",
    "a , the overall rotation of the stars is actually red - shifted , which is seen from the dominance of red ovals in figure [ fig:29 ] .",
    "the locations of the blue ovals that reside to the west of ssc a correspond to a distance of -27@xmath22 from the galaxy center .",
    "if this location is compared with the velocity dispersion plot of the stars for the major axis pa ( top left panel ) in figure [ fig:20 ] , the velocity dispersion is larger by @xmath310 km s@xmath20 from the average stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the increase in stellar velocity dispersion in this region is consistent with secondary star formation that formed out of the surrounding material that was shocked by the expanding shell discussed in section [ sec:4.1.2 ] .",
    "therefore , these peculiar kinematics observed in the stars are likely from light composed mostly of young , luminous stars in ngc 1569 . in the optical _ hst",

    "we estimate the projected surface area of this hole to be about 0.2 kpc@xmath71 at the distance of ngc 1569 .",

    "it is in this hole that we observe the disturbed stellar kinematics .",
    "these features are likely evidence of outflow from mechanical energy input from stellar winds and supernova remnants from the collection of massive stars in the sscs .",
    "large amounts of x - ray emission coming from this region @xcite are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we explore the three - dimensional shape of ngc 1569 using our kinematic measure , @xmath1/@xmath0 .",
    "for this relationship , we use the asymmetric drift corrected @xmath1 from our analysis . because we want the maximum velocity of the baryons that are responding to the total gravitational potential in the galaxy , it is necessary to correct for radial pressures in the gas that can artificially mask the true maximum rotation speed .",
    "we derived an asymmetric drift corrected @xmath1 of 50 @xmath2 10 km s@xmath20 from the analysis , discussed in section [ sec:3.3.3 ] , and we use @xmath0 of 21 @xmath2 4 km s@xmath20 from the stellar kinematics , discussed in section [ sec:3.1.3 ] .",
    "we follow the same reasoning as @xcite for our decision to use @xmath0 in our @xmath73/@xmath19 relation .",
    "we determine a @xmath1/@xmath0 = 2.4 @xmath2 0.7 .",
    "this is indicative of a thick distribution of young stars that dominate our spectra . as a reminder",
    ", this result assumes that the stars are in a virailized disk and that the gaussian profiles are symmetric .",
    "our stellar template spectra span a range of classes and types from f - type main sequence to k - type supergiants and thus , cover a range of stellar ages .",
    "our observed galaxy spectra are a mix of all the stars in the galaxy but , are dominated by the brightest stars , which are the younger stellar population . there may be a thin distribution of older stars that our spectra simply were not sensitive to and perhaps , the disk is thicker in the region of ssc a than in the center of the galaxy .",
    "the increase in velocity dispersion and decrease in rotation speed around ssc a are consistent with velocities of stars that formed from shocked gas surrounding the observed expanding shell in the region of ssc a , as discussed above .",
    "overall , the disk of ngc 1569 appears to be thick compared to spiral galaxies .      here",
    ", we compare the morphology and velocity fields with our deep h@xmath11 image of ngc 1569 and the _ hst _ image .",
    "the left image of figure [ fig : cartoon ] shows the contoured integrated map .",
    "this image displays tenuous emission , detected for the first time , extending to the south of the galaxy disk in a teardrop shape , and to the northeast ; black ovals outline this emission .",
    "also identified in this image are two features to the east labeled as ` companion ' and ` bridge ' identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "stil & israel conclude that these features are indicative of a low mass companion to ngc 1569 .",
    "our data detect this cloud , which can also be easily seen in figures [ fig:47 ] and [ fig:34 ] at around @xmath11 = 04:32:15 , @xmath74 = + 64:49:00 .",
    "the extended emission , circled in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , and the two features identified by @xcite as evidence of a possible low mass companion , may be related to each other and show evidence of a recent interaction or merger with ngc 1569 .",
    "we discuss these claims further in paper ii where we present results from deep gbt mapping around ngc 1569 and three of its nearest neighbors .",
    "figure [ fig:42 ] shows our deep  image with the contoured integrated map overlaid so that we can compare the morphologies .",
    "what is interesting here is that there is an ud cloud to the west that is at the edge of the optical galaxy in the same region where we observe the disturbed stellar kinematics .",
    "this cloud is nearly 50 m@xmath75 pc@xmath76 more dense than the surrounding medium and if there is molecular gas , the column density could be much larger . in figure [ fig:42 ] , we also observe two smaller , dense clouds on the opposite side , east of the optical galaxy .",
    "possibly , there was one continuous , dense structure that connected these two dense clouds with the ud cloud .",
    "the most concentrated stellar light is in between these dense clouds where the sscs reside , which suggests that the stars in this region formed out of the dense ridge that used to connect these clouds .",
    "the trigger for the starburst could have come from the impact of the in - falling ncm cloud , shown in figure [ fig:13 ] and identified by the blue oval in figure [ fig:42 ] , that compressed the interstellar medium of ngc 1569 and caused the dense ridge to collapse .",
    "it is more likely that the ncm cloud is in - falling into the galaxy , rather than outflowing , because there is evidence of shocked gas near the impact area of the ncm cloud as seen in the continuum maps by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we see in figure [ fig:42 ] that , in general , the density is more concentrated to the north of the sscs than it is to the south , as shown by the blue arrows and contour levels .",
    "there is a slight depression in the contour levels right above ssc a as indicated in figure [ fig:42 ] , possibly created by the outflow of the gas .",
    "this figure also shows the approximate location and projected size of two giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) identified by ( * ? ? ?",

    "these gmcs lie between the ud cloud and the sscs and are at the tip of the ncm cloud .",
    "the region between the ud cloud and the sscs that contains the gmcs is the most probable area for the next generation of star formation .",
    "@xcite suggest that the starburst episode in ngc 1569 is ongoing and started roughly 500 myr ago .",
    "also in figure [ fig:42 ] are streamer - like , arced h@xmath11 features , which trace hii regions , toward the south and north . the high density in the north and the visible h@xmath11 features in the south could be the results of the projection effects from the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "the x - ray emission is less absorbed to the south , according to @xcite , indicating that the north side of the galaxy is pointed toward us , thus closer than the south side , assuming that the emission is escaping in the z - direction .",
    "h@xmath11 arcs and streamers extend nearly all the way through the disk in the southern direction of the disk .",
    "similarly , the gas appears more dense in the northern half of the disk because there is more gas along the line - of - sight than there is in the southern half of ngc 1569 .",
    "figure [ fig:42 ] also shows a strong h@xmath11 chimney to the north @xcite .",
    "the depression noted on figure [ fig:42 ] , shows the escape route for the h@xmath11 emission @xcite .",
    "magnetic field lines found by @xcite may be following the outflow of the gas in this region and are channeling cosmic ray electrons out of the disk . although the is more concentrated to the north , due to the projection effect of the inclined disk , the intense stellar winds from the starburst are able to penetrate all the way through the disk in the northern half of the galaxy , too",
    ". tenuous h@xmath11 emission to the northeast of the optical galaxy stretches all the way through the disk just as it does in the southern part of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite discuss the kinematics of the h@xmath11 emission and suggest that ` blowout , ' defined here as gas escaping the gravitational potential of the galaxy , from stellar feedback from the massive stars created in the starburst , is not yet occurring due to decreasing ionized gas velocities at the edges of the expanding h@xmath11 shells seen near ssc a. if we assume the total mass of ngc 1569 is equal to our dynamical mass of 1 x 10@xmath77 @xmath78 ( discussed in section [ sec:4.3 ] ) , then the escape speed is @xmath370 km s@xmath20 at a radius of 2.2 kpc . according to figure [ fig:10 ] ,",
    "the ionized gas we observe with our spectra show high velocity gas in excess of 70 km s@xmath20 indicating that perhaps some of the gas is in the process of being expelled from the galaxy in a blowout .",

    ". however , ott et al .",
    "argue that in order for gas to escape completely from a galaxy , it must be moving at supersonic velocities when it hits the cool surrounding gas at one scale length .",
    "we observe tenuous stretching nearly 12 kpc south of the galaxy that is likely associated with tidal filaments ( paper ii ) , so , the hot gas may cool and fall back onto the disk of ngc 1569 when it hits this cold , neutral gas .",
    "thus , it is not clear if this hot gas will actually escape the galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig:35 ] shows the intensity - weighted velocity contours , with the extended trimmed , superimposed over a low contrast h@xmath11 image . in the region around the h@xmath11 image",
    ", we observe a butterfly shape in the .",
    "the western wing of the butterfly has velocities that are blue - shifted relative to the systemic velocity , as seen by the blue and purple contours , whereas the eastern butterfly wing has red - shifted velocities , as seen by the orange and red contours and are identified in figure [ fig:35 ] .",
    "the location of the ud cloud ( solid black oval ) and ncm cloud from figure [ fig:13 ] ( dashed black oval ) are also indicated .",
    "the velocity structure of the ncm cloud appears different in figure [ fig:35 ] than in figure [ fig:13 ] because we are observing the intensity - weighted velocity field instead of the deconvolved velocity structure .",
    "the possible ` companion ' and ` bridge ' discussed by @xcite are seen as purple contours and do not follow the rotation of the rest of the galaxy .",
    "again , we surmise that these features are most likely remnants from a past interaction .    to the south of the h@xmath11 image in figure [ fig:35 ]",
    ", we see a cavity in the .",
    "this cavity is likely carved out by ultraviolet photons , winds , and explosions from the massive stars in the starburst .",
    "x - ray emission fills the cavity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig:35 ] shows that the spectacular h@xmath11 tail , known as the ` western arm ' from hodge ( 1974 ) , that extends to the southwest of the optical galaxy is , in fact , the lit up edge of the ud cloud .",
    "this western arm was previously believed to have been associated with the strong ncm cloud created from outflow due to the apparent spatial overlap of the two features @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the h@xmath11 tail is , in fact , from infall rather than outflow and that these structures are connected to the bridge .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that gas is being accreted onto ngc 1569 and @xcite also see the h@xmath11 tail emitting soft x - rays .",
    "infalling gas is a likely scenario , especially since we can see tenuous emission to the south and northeast of ngc 1569 , which has the same radial velocities as the bridge .",
    "because the tenuous gas to the south is spread over such a large region of space , @xmath392 kpc@xmath71 , and evidence of interaction is observed in our gbt data , which we report in an upcoming paper , the origin of this tenuous gas , companion , bridge and h@xmath11 tail coming from outflow from the starburst is unlikely .",
    "we conclude that these features are the result of a recent interaction , which caused the ncm cloud to infall and compress a dense ridge that stretched across the entire optical disk , creating a global starburst which created the sscs , and left behind what is now the ud cloud .",
    "we see that the velocities of the ud cloud are fairly constant , but , according to figure [ fig:59 ] , the velocity dispersions at this location are high compared to the average .",
    "thus , we observe that the ud cloud is kinematically warm because of its high velocity dispersion .",
    "perhaps this dense region to the west of the optical disk will be the location of a future star formation episode , provided the gas kinematically cools over time .",
    "we use the sed fitting procedure from @xcite to model the stellar mass and our results are presented in figure [ fig:49 ] . briefly speaking ,",
    "the hubble time is logarithmically divided into six independent age bins , and the star formation rate ( sfr ) in each age bin is assumed to be constant . a library consisting of @xmath3 4 x 10@xmath79 different star formation histories ( sfhs ) is created by changing the relative star formation intensity among the six age bins . in addition , the metallicities and internal dust extinction are also free parameters when creating the library . the usually adopted two - component ( e.g. exponential plus bursts ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling method can introduce a bias in the estimation of parameters @xcite .",

    "any possible degeneracies between different parameters are reflected in the confidence intervals .",

    "figure [ fig:52 ] shows our observed stellar velocity dispersions , plotted so that all radii are positive , along with the model velocity dispersion profile derived from equation [ eqn:5 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig:52 ] , there is general agreement between the observed and predicted stellar velocity dispersions in the center , however , the observed stellar velocity dispersions appear to increase as a function of radius , which is opposite of what is expected .",
    "this anomaly can be explained as an isolated area where the stars have a higher dispersion because they are the stars formed in the expanding shell described in section [ sec:4.1.2 ] .",
    "these high dispersion stellar velocities coincide with the the peculiar dip , identified by the black arrow , at the edge of the expanding shell in figure [ fig:10 ] ( r = @xmath6527@xmath22 @xmath91 0.5 kpc ) .",
    "we do not know how the stars act beyond @xmath30.5 kpc , as our spectra do not probe past this radius , so , we can not definitively determine what happens beyond this increase .",
    "we used the stellar surface density profile , determined from the sed fitting , to model the expected rotation velocities of the stars ( rotmod ) , assuming that the total mass of the galaxy comes from the stars .",
    "the results for this model , corrected for inclination , are shown by the asterisk symbols in figure [ fig:50 ] .",
    "this graph shows that in the inner 1 kpc , half of the observable stellar disk of ngc 1569 , the gravitational potential is dominated by the observed stellar mass .",
    "the total mass of ngc 1569 , summed over the integrated map , figure [ fig:47 ] , is 2.3 x 10@xmath82 m@xmath92 . to calculate the expected velocity of the gas as a function of radius , we use the mass surface density profile .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric , infinitely thin disk comprised entirely of gas and an inclination of 69@xmath13 @xmath60 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the model velocities as a function of radius are shown by the triangle symbols in figure [ fig:50 ] .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity of the model rotation curve is 18 km s@xmath20 , less than half of the asymmetric drift corrected @xmath1 ( filled circles ) .",
    "ngc 1569 also contains molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath93 ) . according to israel ( 1988 ) , the amount of h@xmath93 in ngc 1569 as a whole is about 5 x 10@xmath94 m@xmath92 corrected to a 3.36 mpc distance .",
    "this produces the ratio @xmath95 = 0.2 over the galaxy .",
    "the estimate of the total h@xmath93 is an approximation , though , because israel determined the total h@xmath93 mass by scaling the results derived by @xcite for the central 50@xmath22 of the galaxy .",
    "also , the co to h@xmath93 conversion factor used by israel is potentially dependent on metallicity , and ngc 1569 has a low metallicity .",

    "we have modeled the contributions to the rotation curve of ngc 1569 due to stars and gas . here , we explore the dark matter content in ngc 1569 by assuming that the observed , asymmetric drift corrected , rotation represents motion under the total gravitational potential of the system . using our @xmath1 = 50 km s@xmath20",

    "we are left with only 8.2 x 10@xmath82 m@xmath99 of missing , dark matter within a radius of 2.2 kpc .",
    "there are , however , a number of uncertainties in the dark matter determination .",
    "the most important uncertainty is that we assume that we have found the turnover radius and , hence , the maximum rotation , @xmath1 , of ngc 1569 .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise is low in the region where the turnover radius occurs .",
    "if the true maximum rotation speed of the galaxy is actually higher , then our calculation of dynamical mass , along with the deduced dark matter mass in the central region of ngc 1569 , will be underestimated .",
    "another uncertainty comes from the fact that these calculations use a @xmath1 derived under the assumption that the inclination of the disk is 69@xmath13 @xmath2 7@xmath13 , as determined from the tilted ring model .",
    "if a @xmath1 of 50 km s@xmath20 is correct , then ngc 1569 has a low dark matter content inside the visible disk , which is unlike most other dwarf galaxies studied ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to see the effect of such a low dark matter content , we examine the dark matter fraction , @xmath100 ) , as a function of radius using the following equation given in @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath43 is the rotation velocity corrected for asymmetric drift derived from , @xmath102 is the stellar rotation velocity assuming all the mass is in the stars determined from the sed fitting , and @xmath103 is the gas rotation velocity determined from the surface density assuming newtonian dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig:56 ] shows the fraction of dark matter as a function of radius .",
    "the average values in the inner 1 kpc are zero , within the errors , due to the dominance of the stars .",
    "however , in the outer region , beyond 1.25 kpc , the fraction of dark matter has an average of @xmath30.5 , which is below the average of 0.7 found for a sample of seven dwarf galaxies by oh et al .",
    "we see here that the stars account for all of the dynamical mass within a radius of @xmath31 kpc - no dark matter is needed within this radius .",
    "thus , ngc 1569 appears to be dark matter deficient in the inner disk compared to other dwarfs .    in @xmath104cdm , the dark matter halos hosting galaxies have an approximately universal shape that follows a concentration - mass relation ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , cdm halos are a one - parameter family , typically parameterized by mass within the virialized extent ( @xmath105 ) or maximum circular velocity ( @xmath1 ) . adding the assumption that there is a monotonic mapping of dark matter halo mass to galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , the brightest galaxies are hosted by the most massive dark matter halos ) , a galaxy s dark matter halo can be uniquely determined from its luminosity using the technique of abundance matching @xcite . here",
    ", abundance matching is performed , as described in detail in @xcite , using the halo @xmath1 function from the millenium ii simulation @xcite and the @xmath106 band galaxy luminosity functions of @xcite . the @xmath106 band absolute magnitude for ngc 1569 ( @xmath107 )",
    "is determined from the sed fit described in section [ sec:4.2 ] , and this is used to infer that the halo of ngc 1569 has @xmath108 km s@xmath20 .",
    "this implies @xmath109 , and the virial extent of the halo is @xmath110 kpc .    with these values for the total mass of ngc 1569 s dark matter halo , the concentration - mass relation implies a unique shape for the halo profile .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , the halo shape is parameterized using a @xcite ( nfw ) halo profile and the shape parameters are assigned so that the halo falls on the median of the concentration - mass relation .",
    "figure [ nfw_den ] shows the nfw density profile as a function of radius for ngc 1569 .",
    "the resulting circular velocity profile is given as the solid line in figure [ fig:101 ] .",
    "figure [ fig:50 ] shows the inner region of the nfw profile , solid line , as compared to the modeled gas and stellar masses .    as is clear from figure [ fig:50 ] , the stellar mass is close to the expected dark matter mass in the inner 1 kpc , and the uncertain effect of the baryons on the dark matter halo should be significant here .",
    "thus , it is ambiguous whether or not the dominance of the baryons in the inner 1 kpc implies a halo profile inconsistent with @xmath104cdm , or simply that the baryonic mass of the galaxy is altering the shape of the dark matter halo in the region where the dark matter does not dominate the gravitational forces .    by @xmath111 kpc",
    ", however , the @xmath104cdm prediction lies within the error bars of the measured rotation curve .",
    "if the model is correct , the hint of a turn over in the rotation curve that we see is likely to be an artifact of low signal - to - noise , as the rotation curve implied by this halo profile does not peak until @xmath112 kpc , far beyond the baryonic extent of the galaxy .",
    "additionally , it implies that in a global sense , ngc 1569 is not dark matter deficient because at a radius of @xmath32 kpc , the rotation curve is consistent with @xmath104cdm predictions .",
