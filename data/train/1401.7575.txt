    "the projection operator then is @xmath91 notice that for infinite temperature the projection operator simplifies to @xmath92 . in this form",
    "the projection operator applies to most open quantum systems .",
    "another way to build the projection operator was described in @xcite .",
    "it was proposed to choose operators in from a class of projectors , which project on a subspace of some preserved quantities of the system of interest .",
    "example of conserved quantities of open quantum system can be , e.g. , the total number of particles or the total energy of the system .      in this subsection",
    "we apply the above approximation techniques to the model of an arbitrary spin coupled to a spin bath , as discussed in sec .",
    "the first projection operator has the form    @xmath93    where @xmath37 is defined in eq .  .",
    "the inverse transformation for the density matrix is defined by @xmath94 it is clear , that the transformation does not change the diagonal elements .",
    "we notice @xcite , that the spin system has two naturally conserved quantities , namely , the projection of the total spin on the @xmath95-axis @xmath39 and the square of the full spin @xmath36 .",

    "the inverse transformation for the density matrix @xmath101 is defined by @xmath102 the above transformation gives the identity for the diagonal elements .",
    "the nakajima - zwanzig master equation for the projector and the hamiltonian has the form @xmath103 where the @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105\\exp[\\pm\\beta/2]/(2 \\cosh^n(\\beta/2)).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second order time - convolutionless master equation is obtained by replacing @xmath106 with @xmath107 .    by substituting eqs .   and into eq .",

    "the dynamics of state @xmath112 for spin @xmath66 is shown in figs .",
    "4 - 6 and 9 .",
    "we notice , that for this type of projectors the tcl master equation gives the better result",
    ". nonetheless , change of the inverse temperature has no effect on the accuracy of the methods ( compare figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the increase of the number of spins into the bath leads to a decrease of accuracy ( compare figs . 4 and 6 ) .",

    "and we discuss it in detail . as one can see the eq .",
    "has a non - trivial dependence on the index @xmath117 .",
    "the index @xmath117 can take on a value @xmath118 and consequently the system consists of independent blocks of @xmath119 equations ( we assumed @xmath120 ) , where @xmath121 is the dimension of the density matrix of the central spin .",
    "nonetheless , it can be easily shown that the diagonal elements of any density matrix @xmath122 are independent of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "the structure of the projection operator allows to extract from eq .   a minimal system of @xmath123 coupled equations .",
    "actually , the number of the coupling equation for the diagonal elements is @xmath9 , but the conservation of the total spin of the system gives one more relationship between the equations .",

    "the solution of the system in this case is @xmath135 in the above equation @xmath136 @xmath137 the expressions - are a good approximation for the case @xmath138 and , because the required expression is given by and every term given by - is small we can conclude that such approximation gives a good result for a large number of spins in the bath .    the solution eq .   for the central spin equal to 1",
    "is presented in figs .",
    "one can see , that the nakajima - zwanzig master equation leads to results similar to - for the short time @xmath139 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the solution gives a better result than the approximate solution of the corresponding tcl master equation - .",
    "thus , the method of correlated projection operators gives the same result as the previous one for short time - scales @xmath140 .",
    "another picture emerges for the long - time dynamics ( fig .",
    "9 ) . in this domain",
    "the projectors give the correct qualitative behaviour and allow to predict the increase of some peaks .",

    "is more useful .",
    "the nakajima - zwanzig equation for the model under consideration is solved analytically , but the corresponding tcl master equation can be solved only approximately .",
    "so , for the case of the central spin equal to 1 , the use of the nakajima - zwanzig master equation for the projectors is to be preferred , because it can be solved exactly .",
    "in the present article we have investigated the model of an arbitrary spin coupled with a bath of 1/2-spins . the exact solution for the reduced density matrix , corresponding to the central spin , was found and used to test a few approximation techniques .",

    "we have considered two types of projection operators from the general class of the time - independent projectors .",
    "namely , the first operator projects on the equilibrium bath state at a temperature @xmath141 and the second operator projects on the eigenspace of the bath operators @xmath98 and @xmath99 . for both choices of projection operators we have derived the second order nakajima - zwanzig master equations and , and also the corresponding tcl master equations .",
    "every master equation was applied to a model of central spin equal to one .    as the main result of this article",
    "we indicate that the traditional way to approximate open spin systems based on the time - independent projection operators gives the correct short - times dynamics of the relevant part of the system .",
    "the time - scales of the applicability of such approximate method can be estimated of the order of @xmath142 where @xmath1 is the coupled constant and @xmath2 is the number of spins in the bath .",
    "it seems , that approximation methods based on time - independent projection techniques are not so accurate for a large numbers of spins in the bath .",
    "the dependence on @xmath2 can be removed by renormalization of the interaction constant , as @xmath143 . in this case",
    "the time - scale for the applicability of the second order approximation will scale as @xmath144 .",
    "some authors include such a factor in the initial hamiltonian @xcite . in this sense , we have formally derived the meaning of this factor .    for spin star models",
    "the accuracy substantially depends on the number of spins in a spin bath .",
    "the time - scales of accurate reproduction of the exact dynamics can be estimated as @xmath145 .",
    "nevertheless , the tcl master equation with the traditional projectors gives better result than the corresponding nakajima - zwanzig master equation , and , moreover , gives similar results as the correlated projection operator for short time - scales dynamics . in order to predict short time - scales dynamics",
    "it is more useful to use the simplest projection operators combined with the technique of the tcl master equation .    in this connection",
    "we notice that the correlated projection operator technique may be useful for the prediction of the long - time behaviour of the spin system , if the analytical solution of the correlated projection operator master equation can be found .",
    "however , we emphasize that this result is beyond the scope of applicability of the second - order approximations and is rather a nice exception . in every concrete case",
    "long - time dynamics must be investigated additionally with the help of other methods .",
    "note that all the approximate equations of the second order presented in the paper give an equivalent dynamics , and can be easily extended to the non - resonant case , as shown in the appendix of this paper .",
    "thus , it is advisable to use the simplest approximate equation , namely , the tcl master equation derived with help of the traditional projection operator",
    ". it might be helpful to note , all approximate techniques have limits of applicability and here we have shown   the limit of applicability of the projection methods of the second - order .",
    "finally , it seems that the traditional methods do not work well for spin bath models .",
    "thus , it is necessary to develop new approximation techniques for strongly correlated open systems .",

    "so , the diagonal matrix elements are described with the same accuracy both approximated solutions ( a5)-(a8 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix is shown in fig .",
    "it seems that in this case the correlated projection operator works better .",
    "the solution following from the correlated projector master equation describes the amplitude of oscillations more precisely , but the oscillations have a different phase and do not allow to predict the exact dynamics with reasonable accuracy , only the qualitative behaviour .",
    "thus , the applicability of the second order approximate methods can be estimated as @xmath166 where @xmath147 is the detuning .",
    "notice , that the dynamics of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix ( eqs .  ( a6 ) and ( a8 ) ) presented in @xcite seems to have another behaviour .",
    "it is due to the authors @xcite represent them results in the interaction picture and we represent our results in the schrdinger picture .",
    "let us consider the differences between - and the results derived in @xcite .",
    "the correlated projection operator master equation gives a dynamics which completely agrees with the corresponding results in @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results derived with the help of the traditional master equation differ from the corresponding results in @xcite ( see eq .  ( 58 ) therein ) .",
    "the results corresponding to eq .  ( 58 in @xcite ) hold only for @xmath167 under the integral in eq .  .",
    "this is true only if @xmath168 which corresponds to the absence of the system - bath interaction .",
    "note , that we use the spin matrices , which differ from the pauli matrices by factor 1/2 .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the results of [ 13 ] if to make the change of variable @xmath1 to @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the coupling constant in [ 13 ] ."
