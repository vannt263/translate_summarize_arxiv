    "matter - wave optics is a new and fascinating branch of research benefiting from the rapid progress of techniques for laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute atomic and molecular gases enables the study of matter waves from incoherent to coherent domains @xcite . in recent years",
    ", coherent matter waves have been studied extensively , such as the formation of vortices in bec , linear and nonlinear propagation of atomic laser beams @xcite , and other phenomena .",
    "the matter wave has unique applications , as in atomic interferometry @xcite , atomic holography @xcite , and so on .",
    "according to existing theory , pure bec exists only at zero temperature .",
    "however , zero temperature is not reachable experimentally due to the limits of laser cooling @xcite .",
    "all the bec and atomic lasers employed in experiments have distributions of momenta @xcite .",
    "therefore , matter waves , in the strict sense , are not completely coherent .",
    "all the cold atom gases produced by laser cooling at finite temperature are partially coherent matter waves ( pcmw ) , whose properties during propagation and evolution are important issues and play a crucial role in the applications of matter waves .",
    "nevertheless , they not been investigated sufficiently .",
    "it is well known that a coherent matter wave can be described by a single wave function whose evolution is governed by the gross pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a pcmw ca nt be described by a single - particle wave function , but requires a much more complicated treatment .",
    "one method is the finite temperature bec theory , which separates the matter wave field operator into two terms ; one term describes the condensate part , and the other term deals with the noncondensate part .",
    "however , the equations based on this method are complicated and ca nt be solved analytically .",
    "additional approximations are necessary to solve the equations . for example , in the hartree - fock - bogliubov ( hfb ) approximation @xcite , the condensate wave function satisfies the gp equation , and the noncondensate operator is described by an equation that follows from subtracting the gp equation from the total field operator s heisenberg equation . in the hartree - fock ( hf ) and popov approximation @xcite , the condensate wave function is defined by the modified gp equation , whereby the anomalous \" density is neglected and the noncondensate part consists of thermally excited atoms as described in terms of a semiclassical phase space distribution function . in an extended hfb theory , the collisionless noncondensate dynamics is included within second - order perturbation schemes , and the expressions for damping rates and frequency shifts of low - energy modes are derived @xcite .",
    "another approach to describe a pcmw is the correlation function , which provides quantitative information about the coherence and the intensity of matter waves .",
    "the first - order correlation function characterizes local fluctuations of the phase of the complex matter wave field amplitude , and is related to the contrast achievable in an interference experiment .",
    "the second - order correlation function is related to fluctuations of the modulus of the complex matter wave field amplitude , and expresses the tendency of atoms either to cluster or to remain spatially separated @xcite .",
    "meystre et al .",
    "derived the van - citter - zernike theorem of pcmw , which disregards the interactions among the particles .",
    "they analyzed the propagation of the matter wave from an incoherent matter wave source @xcite , and discussed the detection of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "this method is analogous to that used in traditional optics @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the propagation and evolution of pcmw by applying the correlation function method , and disregard the interactions among the particles , although it is not necessary . the abcd matrix formalism @xcite , which previously had only been applicable for the wave function of a single particle , is extended to the pcmw .",
    "a generalized abcd law to describe the evolution of the pcmw is derived by a tensor method .",
    "an analytical solution of the first - order correlation function after evolution is obtained , which makes the evolution problem of the pcmw very simple and clear .",
    "the results are useful in the analysis of the space - time coherence , spatial distribution , propagation and imaging properties of the pcmw .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[bordabcd ] , we introduce briefly the abcd matrix formalism for a single - particle wavepacket . in sec.[tensorabcd ] , the abcd matrix formalism is extended by a tensor method to describe the pcmw . in sec.[example ] , the evolution properties of an ultracold atomic sample released in a gravitational field are calculated numerically and discussed .",

    "figure [ figure ] shows the evolution of the pcmw , with the parameters given in the caption .",
    "the initial atom density profile , which is shown in fig.[figure](a ) , is elliptical due to the initial inhomogeneous confinement of the cold atom gas on the x - y plane ; that is , the confinement in the x - direction is stronger , which causes a larger speed of expansion of the matter wave in this direction when the confinement is removed . during evolution without confinement ,",
    "the atom density profile expands gradually ( fig[figure](b ) ) , and changes to a circle ( fig.[figure](c ) ) .",
    "finally the atom density profile becomes an ellipse again with the major axis perpendicular to that of the initial ellipse , as shown in fig.[figure](d ) .",
    "this is because the degree of expansion in the x - direction exceeds that in the y - direction .",
    "this property is similar to that of light beams .",
    "in this paper , a theoretical description of a partially coherent matter wave ( pcmw ) based on the analogy between a matter wave and an optical wave is presented .",
    "the propagation and evolution formula of the gaussian - schell - model pcmw is provided , and a generalized tensor abcd law is derived . as an example , we analyzed the atom density profile in a transverse plane of a @xmath121 cold atom beam .",
    "the results show that the tensor abcd law is a very convenient method for treating the propagation and transformation of partially coherent cold atom beams .",
    "most importantly , the previous results for partially coherent light can be converted into a pcmw .",
    "our method can be applied to analyze the propagation and evolution properties of ultracold atom beams in various potentials , such as an optical potential and a magnetic potential .",
    "this method can also be extended to pulsed matter wave propagation , and to include the interactions among atoms and the internal state of atoms with some modifications",
