    "the gravastar model has been proposed by mazur and mottola ( mm ) as a possible end point of the gravitational collapse of a massive body @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the classical scenario of the gravitational collapse into a schwarzschild black hole , the gravastar concept avoids the formation of the black hole horizon . technically , the gravastar is a global , static , spherically symmetric solution to the einstein equations . in the interior",
    "there is a segment of the de  sitter geometry which is matched to the exterior schwarzschild geometry by means of a spherical shell of matter . in the original mm model the quantum phase transition takes place within the boundary layer / shell , but the full quantum treatment is immediately replaced by the mean field approximation in which ( classical ) einstein equations are valid .",
    "the de  sitter geometry in the interior of the gravastar implies constant positive ( dark ) energy density @xmath2 accompanied by the isotropic negative pressure @xmath3 .",
    "such energy - momentum content of the spacetime is equivalent to introducing the positive cosmological constant @xmath4 into the einstein equations , and can be understood as the gravitational vacuum , or gravitational condensate , which motivated the coining of the term gravastar ( _ _ gra__vitational _ _ va__cuum _ star _ ) . in this original model of mm ,",
    "the phase transition layer consists of two spherical @xmath0-shells with vanishing surface energy density but with non - vanishing surface pressure , between which there is a thin layer of stiff matter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the transition layer is positioned arbitrarily close to where the horizon of the schwarzschild geometry is expected to form . in this way",
    "the gravastar model allows for arbitrarily high gravitational surface red - shifts and is , for an external observer , indistinguishable from being a true black hole .",
    "a simplified gravastar model was constructed by visser and wiltshire @xcite in order to study the stability properties .",
    "the phase transition layer was replaced by a single spherical @xmath0-shell .",
    "the issue of stability could not be fully settled because the equation of state for the shell is not available .",
    "however , it was shown that physically reasonable equations of state could lead to gravastar configurations that are stable against radial perturbations .",
    "this simplified gravastar model also motivated a number of authors to consider different vacuum geometries in the interior and the exterior .",
    "this includes the models with anti - de  sitter interior and the schwarzschild ",
    "de  sitter exterior geometries and also the reissner ",
    "nordstrm geometries @xcite , the born  infeld phantom gravastar @xcite , and the non - linear electrodynamics gravastar @xcite . a different development of the gravastar idea went in the direction of constructing models with continuous profiles for the energy density and the anisotropic pressures @xcite . in these models",
    "the energy momentum tensor in the centre of the spherical structure satisfies @xmath6 and through the layer of anisotropic principal pressures ( crust ) smoothly joins with the exterior vacuum spacetime .",
    "gravastars with shells of finite thickness but without @xmath0-shells at the boundaries with the vacuum regions have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and it has been pointed out that quasi - normal modes of oscillations might be a possible way of distinguishing gravastars from black holes .",
    "an account of the observational constraints placed on the gravastar model has been given in ref .",
    "the gravastar models are also closely related to a broader subject of dark energy stars , see eg",
    ".  ref .",
    "in fact , the ideas of astrophysical bodies with the de  sitter core representing the gravitationally collapsed matter at extremely high density can be traced back to the work of sakharov @xcite and gliner @xcite and have been further investigated by dymnikova in a series of papers starting with @xcite , see eg .",
    "refs  @xcite and references therein .",
    "given that the physical mechanism behind the proposed vacuum phase transition within the gravastar shell is essentially unknown , the energy conditions of gr @xcite provide the most widely accepted framework of model - of - matter independent constraints one can impose on the ` exotic matter ' comprising the shell .",
    "it is therefore important to fully investigate the constraints on the gravastar model that are imposed by the energy conditions . in this work",
    "we will consider the @xmath0-shell gravastar model of ref  @xcite and we will derive the sharp analytic bounds on the surface compactness that follow from the requirement that the dominant energy condition ( dec ) is satisfied at the shell .",
    "the dec will include the weak ( wec ) and the null energy conditions ( nec ) , but not the strong energy condition ( sec ) .",
    "since the sec is violated from the outset by the dark energy in the interior of the gravastar , it does not appear natural to require that it holds throughout the phase transition layer .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we review the @xmath0-shell gravastar model and we introduce the configuration variables that we use through the rest of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ec ] we discuss the energy conditions of gr imposed on the energy - momentum tensor of the gravastar shell and in sec .",
    "[ sec : allowed ] we carry out the detailed analysis of the gravastar configurations allowed by the dec . in sec .",

    "the line element for the interior and the exterior geometries can be written using the geometrized units @xmath7 and the coordinates @xmath8 in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere , @xmath11 is the time coordinate scaling constant , and @xmath12 is the _ compactness function _ related to the quasi - local mass function @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy density .",
    "in general , to avoid the formation of the event horizon within the spherical body the compactness must be less than unity .",
    "in the interior of the gravastar shell we have the segment of the de  sitter geometry with the constant energy density @xmath16 and the compactness is given by @xmath17 at @xmath18 the interior compactness reaches unity which corresponds to the position of the de  sitter ( cosmological ) horizon .",
    "therefore the surface of the gravastar must be located at the radius @xmath19 .    in the exterior",
    "we have the schwarzschild  de  sitter geometry with the constant energy density @xmath20 and mass parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the exterior compactness is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath21 , this is clearly the schwarzschild geometry , while with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , this is the de  sitter geometry . in the general case we are considering , @xmath24 , @xmath21",

    "thus , if the gravastar surface is located at @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , no horizon forms within the gravastar geometry up to the outer horizon of the schwarzschild  de  sitter geometry .    since the original motivation behind the mm gravastar model was to construct a highly compact object that could represent a gravitationally collapsed body of positive gravitational mass , one expects the ( dark ) energy density inside the gravastar to be greater than that of the surrounding space , i.e.  @xmath32 , or equivalently @xmath33 .",
    "we refer to the above as the `` gravastar requirement '' .",
    "note also that the constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 are introduced for notational convenience ; however , @xmath35 can be viewed as the cosmological constant @xmath36 present in the einstein equations provided that in the exterior of the gravastar shell we set @xmath37 and in the interior we set @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in the picture with the cosmological constant , demanding that the energy density in the interior of the gravastar shell is non - negative , @xmath39 , is equivalent to our `` gravastar requirement '' . therefore",
    ", although it _ is _ technically possible to construct the gravastar - like solutions to the einstein equations with @xmath40 and @xmath21 , we will not consider them in this analysis .    through",
    "the rest of the paper we will describe the gravastar configurations in terms of the configuration variables defined as follows : @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the values of the compactness on the interior and the exterior side of the shell , while @xmath44 is the contribution to the compactness at the exterior side of the shell due to the energy density in the exterior .    for the gravastar geometry we require @xmath45 @xmath44 and @xmath42",
    "are non - negative since the energy densities in the interior and in the exterior are non - negative by assumption .",
    "the condition @xmath46 reflects the above mentioned ` gravastar requirement ' .",

    "[ sec : ec ] , ensures that the energy density of the gravastar shell is non - negative .",
    "the gravastar shell is a timelike hypersurface of constant radius @xmath29 along which the interior and the exterior geometries are joined .",
    "the israel s thin shell formalism @xcite ( for textbook coverage see eg .",
    "@xcite ) allows one to assign the energy - momentum distribution to the hypersurface , as required to make the resulting spacetime a solution of einstein equations .",
    "the first junction condition requires that the induced metric on the hypersurface be the same for the metrics on both sides of the hypersurface . parametrizing the hypersurface with the coordinates @xmath50 , the hypersurface metric tensor @xmath51 as induced from the metric ( [ eq : gends2 ] ) is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the hypersurface line element is given by @xmath54 therefore , for the first junction condition to hold we must have @xmath55 .",
    "this is accomplished by setting @xmath56 for compatibility with the usual form of the exterior schwarzschild metric in case @xmath23 , and setting @xmath57 to appropriately rescale the time coordinate in the interior .",
    "the second junction condition requires that for the smooth joining of the metrics on the two sides of the hypersurface the extrinsic curvature on the hypersurface , @xmath58 , be the same on both sides of the hypersurface .",

    "one can see from the structure of ( [ eq : sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : theta ] ) that the status of the energy conditions for the gravastar shell can be studied in the space of the three configuration variables , @xmath72 .",
    "as pointed out in introduction , we require that the energy momentum tensor of the gravastar shell satisfies all energy conditions except the sec .",
    "since the dec is more restrictive than the wec or the nec , we proceed to consider the dec through a number of steps .",
    "we begin with the condition of non - negative surface energy density which , as can be easily seen from ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , reduces to @xmath73 this requirement has already been encoded in ( [ eq : zxy ] ) .",

    "i.e. shells under ( positive ) surface pressure , the condition @xmath71 reduces to @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 for the case @xmath64 , i.e.  shell under ( positive ) tension , @xmath71 reduces to @xmath84 where @xmath85 combining the above cases with the condition ( [ eq : nnsigma ] ) allows us to summarize the dec ( which includes the wec and the nec ) with the following conditions on the configuration variables @xmath72 : @xmath86 the configurations saturating the dec with @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be called stiff and anti - stiff shells .",
    "the implications of these conditions on the allowed gravastar configurations are studied in the next section .",
    "the shape of the functions @xmath76 , @xmath82 and @xmath89 , given by ( [ eq : fzero ] ) , ( [ eq : fplus ] ) and ( [ eq : fminus ] ) , determines the regions in the space of configuration variables @xmath72 that are allowed by the dec ( [ eq : dec ] ) .",
    "in addition , we recall the ` gravastar condition ' @xmath46 , expressing the requirement that the ( dark ) energy density inside the gravastar is not less than the energy density in the exterior spacetime . before dividing the analysis into cases corresponding to specific ranges of the configuration variable @xmath44",

    "the finding which is relevant in the context of the gravastar model is that the introduction of the de  sitter geometry ( dark energy ) in the interior , relative to the flat interior geometry ( hollow shell ) , does not help to support the dec - satisfying shell against the collapse at high values of the surface compactness , as it might be naively expected due to the repulsive character of the de  sitter interior ( free falling particle accelerating away from the centre ) .",

    "compact objects like gravastars envisaged as possible alternatives to black holes are certainly not less controversial than black holes themselves @xcite .",
    "the essential phenomenological feature of a gravastar that makes it difficult to distinguish such a body from a true black hole is its high surface redshift . also , the analysis of radiation from a supermassive object sgr  a@xmath204 @xcite implied the existence of a horizon in this object . however , the absence of detectable heating could also be consistent with a gravastar possesing sufficiently large heat capacity @xcite .",
    "another feature which may help in this respect is the analysis of quasi - normal modes of oscillation of a gravastar .",
    "they are found to be different from those of a black hole @xcite , and could , in principle , provide a way to observationally discern a gravastar from a black hole . in the same spirit",
    "it is important to analyze the constraints on possible realisations of gravastar models .",
    "since the physical theory behind the quantum vacuum phase transitions which are assumed to take place within the gravastar shell has not been fully formulated , the energy conditions of gr provide the most general model - independent constraint on the structure of the energy - momentum tensor of the gravastar .",
    "we have carried out a detailed analysis of the constraints that the energy conditions impose on the possible configurations of the single @xmath0-shell version of the gravastar model @xcite .",
    "the most relevant constraint is the upper bound on the surface compactness @xmath205 of the gravastar which was in the original mm model assumed to approach unity arbitrarily close .",
    "exactly this feature gives raise to arbitrarily large surface gravitational redshift which makes the gravastar observationally difficult to distinguish from the true schwarzschild black hole .",
    "( note that the original mm model violates the dec at its two @xmath0-shells that are assumed to possess nonvanishing surface pressure but vanishing surface energy density . for a general discussion of known violations of energy conditions",
    "refs  @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have derived the bounds on the surface compactness that follow from the requirement that the matter comprising the gravastar shell satisfies the dec .",
    "the procedure is fully analytic and has been made possible by the use of the configuration variables @xmath166 based the values of the compactness at the inner and the outer side of the shell defined in ( [ eq : xyz ] ) .",
    "the space of gravastar configurations satisfying the dec is confined within the range @xmath206 , where the functions @xmath89 and @xmath82 identifying the configurations with anti - stiff and stiff shells are given by ( [ eq : fminus ] ) and ( [ eq : fplus ] ) . in case of the schwarzschild exterior geometry the maximal surface compactness @xmath207 is achieved with a stiff shell and flat geometry in the gravastar interior ( compactness in the interior side of the shell @xmath208 ) , i.e.  in the limit of vanishing ( dark ) energy density in the interior . introducing the ( dark ) energy density in the interior ( @xmath209 ) does not lead to higher surface compactness that can be reached .",
    "this finding may be seen as counter - intuitive since one might have expected that the repulsive character of the de  sitter geometry will help to support the shell against the collapse .",
    "however , as our analysis has shown , this is not the case if the shell is to satisfy the dec .    for completeness",
    ", we have extended our analysis to the case of the schwarzschild  de  sitter exterior geometry which places the gravastar model in the context where the positive cosmological constant @xmath132 is present in the einstein equations .",
    "relevant bounds on the surface compactness have been obtained for all values of the configuration variable @xmath210 , @xmath177 being the gravastar radius . for @xmath211",
    "the highest surface compactness is bounded below unity and is achieved with the stiff shell . at @xmath137 there is a wide range of configurations where the surface compactness can approach unity arbitrarily close and it includes shells under surface pressure , dust shells and shells under surface tension . for @xmath164",
    "the highest surface compactness is again bounded below unity and is achieved with anti - stiff shells .",
    "we have also applied the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute the quantity @xmath212 which in the context of perfect fluids corresponds to the speed of sound .",
    "in order not to violate the principle of causality one normally requires that the sound speed does not exceed the speed of light .",
    "this requirement has given still stronger upper bounds on the gravastar surface compactness as compared to the bounds derived from the energy conditions .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the procedure is based on the assumption that the exotic matter comprising the gravastar shell obeys a barotropic equation of state of the form @xmath172 , on the assumption that the shell is stable against the radial perturbations , and most importantly on the assumption that the fluctuations in surface tension and surface energy density propagate along the shell at the speed given by the usual formula stated above .",
    "since the full theory describing the gravastar shell is not available none of these assumptions can be taken for granted .",
    "similar situation has been encountered in the context of the stability analysis of wormhole solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all the above results were derived using the @xmath0-shell gravastar model , but they may be relevant in the broader context of the dark energy stars , or gravastars with continuous pressure profiles , where one attempts to construct astrophysically plausible models of self - gravitating objects with dark - energy cores . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , and applied in in ref .",
    "@xcite , such objects require anisotropic principal pressures .",
    "the analysis of the maximal surface compactness of anisotropic spheres is considerably more complicated than in the isotropic case ; probably the most general results obtained in this area is ref .",
    "@xcite , although still not general enough to include the case of the dark energy interior , or ref .",
    "@xcite where the influence of the cosmological constant on the compactness and other physical parameters of anisotropic configurations was considered .",
    "however , thin shells ( soap bubbles ) appear to be the most efficient configurations in attempts to reach high surface compactness of anisotropic spherical bodies .",
    "the maximal compactness of the ` shell around a black hole ' of ref .",
    "@xcite , or that of our flat interior gravastar ( hollow shell ) , clearly saturates the general bound derived in ref .",
