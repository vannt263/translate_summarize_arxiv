    "the cosmological constant problem @xcite-@xcite , the accelerated expansion of the late time universe@xcite , the cosmic coincidence @xcite are challenges for the foundations of modern physics ( see also reviews on dark energy@xcite,@xcite , dark matter @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerous models have been proposed with the aim to find answer to these puzzles , for example : the quintessence@xcite , coupled quintessence@xcite , @xmath2-essence@xcite , variable mass particles@xcite , interacting quintessence@xcite , chaplygin gas@xcite , phantom field@xcite , tachyon matter cosmology@xcite , brane world scenarios@xcite , etc .. these puzzles have also motivated an interest in modifications and even radical revisions of the standard gravitational theory ( general relativity ( gr))@xcite,@xcite . although motivations for most of these models can be found in fundamental theories like for example in brane world@xcite , the questions concerning the einstein gr limit and relation to the regular particle physics , like standard model , still remain unclear .",
    "the listed and a number of other cosmological and astrophysical problems generate fundamental questions which are directly addressed to particle physics , like : what is the dark matter from the point of view of particle physics ; what is the relation between dark energy and the vacuum of particle physics after gauge symmetry breaking ; how the latter question is related to the cosmological constant problem ; what is the precise physics of the inflation of the early universe , etc ..    on the other side , even without the cosmological input , particle physics has its own fundamental questions , like for example : what is the origin of fermionic generations ; whether is it possible to realize spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking without using tachyonic mass term .",
    "it is very hard to imagine that it is possible to propose ideas which are able to solve all the above mentioned problems keeping at the same time unchanged the basis of fundamental physics , i.e. gravity and particle field theory .",
    "this paper may be regarded as _",
    "an attempt to find satisfactory answers at least to a part of the fundamental questions on the basis of first principles _ ,",
    "i.e. without using semi - empirical models . in this paper",
    "we explore the so called two measures field theory ( tmt ) where gravity ( or more exactly , geometry ) and particle field theory intertwined in a very non trivial manner , but the einstein gr is restored when the fermion matter energy density is much larger than the vacuum energy density .    here",
    "we _ have no purpose _ of constructing a complete realistic cosmological scenario .",
    "instead , we concentrate our attention on studying a number of _ new surprising enough effects _ of tmt . we study the model which possesses gauge and scale symmetry ( the latter includes the shift symmetry of the dilaton field @xmath0 ) .",
    "the scale symmetry is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the tmt dynamics . except for peculiar properties of the tmt action",
    ", the latter does not contain any exotic terms , i.e. _ only terms presented in standard model considered in curved space - time are present in our action_. the scalar sector dynamics represents an explicit example of @xmath2-essence resulting from first principles .    in context of cosmological dynamics",
    ", we study in this paper only the scalar sector of the model which includes the dilaton @xmath0 and the higgs @xmath1 fields .",
    "the higgs contribution to the action has no terms which could be treated as tachyonic mass terms .",
    "the parameter space of the model is large enough that allows to find different regions where the following different effects can take place _ without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions _ :",
    "\\a ) possibility of a power law inflation driven by a scalar field @xmath0 which is followed by the late time evolution driven both by a small cosmological constant and a scalar field @xmath0 with a quintessence - like potential ; smallness of the cosmological constant can be achieved _ without fine tuning of dimensionfull parameters_.    \\b ) in another region of the parameters , there is a possibility of the power law inflation ended with damped oscillations of @xmath0 around the state with zero cosmological constant ( we want to emphasize again that this is realized without tuning of the parameters and initial conditions ) . thus this scenario includes _ a resolution of the old cosmological constant problem _ , at least at the classical level .",
    "this becomes possible because one of the basic assumptions of the weinberg no - go theorem@xcite is violated in our model .",
    "\\d ) there is a region of the parameters where solutions for the late time universe possess the following unexpected features : the dark energy density @xmath10 increases asymptotically ( as @xmath6 ) approaching from below to a constant value ; the equation - of - state @xmath3 in the late time universe is @xmath4 and @xmath5 _ asymptotically approaches _ @xmath7 _ from below_. this effect is achieved without any exotic term in the action similar to what is present in phantom models@xcite .",
    "\\e ) in the model with both dilaton @xmath0 and higgs @xmath1 fields , the power law inflation consists of two stages : during the first stage @xmath1 remains close to its initial value ; about 60 e - folding before the end of inflation @xmath1 suffers a transition to the state of damping oscillations around @xmath11 . after the end of the power law inflation a transition of the higgs field to a broken gauge symmetry phase @xmath8 occurs via oscillations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting that this early universe scenario is realized _ without tachyonic mass terms_. another remarkable feature is that _ the energy density in the symmetry broken phase is zero without tuning of the parameters and initial conditions_.    since we have not yet studied the particle creation that must be due to oscillations of the higgs field , we are not able to present here a complete cosmological scenario including the described above effects in a consistent way .",
    "nevertheless it is evident that the listed effects can be in principle be useful for a unified resolution of some of the cosmological and particle physics fundamental problems .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in sec.ii we present a review of the basic ideas of tmt and formulate a gauge and scale invariant model .",
    "the remaining part of the main text of the paper is devoted to study of the scalar sector dynamics of the model including dilaton @xmath0 and higgs @xmath1 fields .",
    "however the way the @xmath1 field is introduced in our tmt model requires a special consideration of its properties in order to demonstrate that it is indeed able to perform all what one should demand from the higgs field , for example in the standard model .",
    "this was the reason of the need to include also gauge fields and fermions into the description of the model although they are not the subject of this paper .",
    "this is done in sec.ii and appendixes a and b. in appendix a we present equations of motion in the original frame .",
    "appendix b is devoted to the spin - connections . using results of appendixes a and b , the complete set of equations of motion in the einstein frame",
    "is given in sec.iic .",
    "in sec.iii we give a detailed formulation of the scalar sector cosmological dynamics in the spatially flat frw universe . for pedagogical reasons",
    "there is a need to present the results first without the higgs field : in secs.iv-vi for three different shapes of the effective potential we study the attractor behavior of the phase trajectories , the cosmological constant problem and possibility of super - acceleration .",
    "main features of the cosmological dynamics driven both by the dilaton field and the higgs field are studied in sec.vii .",
    "the discussion section gives a systematic analysis of the main ideas and results . in appendix c",
    "we shortly review our previous results of tmt@xcite concerning the restoration of gr and resolution of the fifth force problem in normal particle physics conditions , i.e. when the local fermionic energy density is many orders of magnitude larger than the scalar dark energy density in the space - time region occupied by the fermion .",
    "although this is not a subject of the present paper we believe that it is important for reader to know that in normal particle physics conditions tmt reproduces gr . in appendix",
    "d we shortly discuss what kind of model one would obtain when choosing fine tuned couplings to measures @xmath12 and@xmath13 in the action .",
    "some additional remarks concerning the relation between the structure of tmt action and the cosmological constant problem are given in appendix e.",
    "tmt is a generally coordinate invariant theory where _ all the difference from the standard field theory in curved space - time consists only of the following three additional assumptions _ :",
    "the first assumption is the hypothesis that the effective action at the energies below the planck scale has to be of the form@xcite-@xcite @xmath14 including two lagrangians @xmath15 and @xmath16 and two measures of integration @xmath13 and @xmath12 or , equivalently , two volume elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "one is the usual measure of integration @xmath13 in the 4-dimensional space - time manifold equipped with the metric @xmath19 .",
    "another is the new measure of integration @xmath12 in the same 4-dimensional space - time manifold .",
    "the measure @xmath12 being a scalar density and a total derivative in string and brane theories see ref.@xcite .",
    "] may be defined    * either by means of four scalar fields @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , cf . with the approach by wilczek , @xmath22 * or by means of a totally antisymmetric three index field @xmath23 @xmath24    to provide parity conservation in the case given by eq.([phi ] )",
    "one can choose for example one of @xmath20 s to be a pseudoscalar ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) we must choose @xmath23 to have negative parity .",
    "some ideas concerning the nature of the measure fields @xmath20 are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a special case of the structure ( [ s ] ) with definition ( [ aabg ] ) has been recently discussed in ref.@xcite in applications to supersymmetric theory and the cosmological constant problem .",
    "it is assumed that the lagrangians @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of all matter fields , the dilaton field , the metric , the connection ( or spin - connection ) but not of the `` measure fields '' ( @xmath20 or @xmath23 ) . in such a case , i.e. when the measure fields enter in the theory only via the measure @xmath12 , the action ( [ s ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry . in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) these symmetry transformations have the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are arbitrary functions of @xmath27 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) ; in the case given by eq.([aabg ] ) they read @xmath28 where @xmath29 are four arbitrary functions of @xmath27 and @xmath30 is numerically the same as @xmath31 .",
    "one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of a measure fields dependence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "important feature of tmt that is responsible for many interesting and desirable results of the field theory models studied so far@xcite-@xcite consists of the assumption that all fields , including also metric , connection ( or vierbein and spin - connection ) and the _ measure fields _ ( @xmath20 or @xmath23 ) are independent dynamical variables .",
    "all the relations between them are results of equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the independence of the metric and the connection means that we proceed in the first order formalism and the relation between connection and metric is not necessarily according to riemannian geometry .",
    "we want to stress again that except for the listed three assumptions we do not make any changes as compared with principles of the standard field theory in curved space - time . in other words , all the freedom in constructing different models in the framework of tmt consists of the choice of the concrete matter content and the lagrangians @xmath15 and @xmath16 that is quite similar to the standard field theory .",
    "since @xmath12 is a total derivative , a shift of @xmath27 by a constant , @xmath32 , has no effect on the equations of motion . similar shift of @xmath16 would lead to the change of the constant part of the lagrangian coupled to the volume element @xmath33 . in the standard",
    "gr , this constant term is the cosmological constant .",
    "however in tmt the relation between the constant term of @xmath16 and the physical cosmological constant is very non trivial ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .    in the case of the definition of @xmath12 by means of eq.([phi ] ) , varying the measure fields @xmath20 , we get @xmath34 since @xmath35 it follows that if @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass . in what follows we make the choice @xmath40 .    in the case of the definition ( [ aabg ] ) , variation of @xmath23 yields @xmath41 that implies eq.([varphi ] ) without the condition",
    "@xmath36 needed in the model with four scalar fields @xmath20 .    one should notice _ the very important differences of tmt from scalar - tensor theories with nonminimal coupling _ : + a ) in general , the lagrangian density @xmath27 ( coupled to the measure @xmath12 ) may contain not only the scalar curvature term ( or more general gravity term ) but also all possible matter fields terms .",
    "this means that tmt modifies in general both the gravitational sector and the matter sector ; b ) if the field @xmath12 were the fundamental ( non composite ) one then instead of ( [ varphi ] ) , the variation of @xmath12 would result in the equation @xmath42 and therefore the dimensionfull integration constant @xmath43 would not appear in the theory .",
    "applying the palatini formalism in tmt one can show ( see for example @xcite and appendix c of the present paper ) that the resulting relation between metric and connection includes also the gradient of the ratio of the two measures @xmath44 which is a scalar field .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath45 and its gradient .",
    "it turns out that at least at the classical level , the measure fields affect the theory only through the scalar field @xmath45 .    the consistency condition of equations of motion has the form of a constraint which determines @xmath46 as a function of matter fields .",
    "the surprising feature of the theory is that neither newton constant nor curvature appear in this constraint which means that the _ geometrical scalar field _",
    "@xmath46 _ is determined by the matter fields configuration _ locally and straightforward ( that is without gravitational interaction ) .    by an appropriate change of the dynamical variables which includes a conformal transformation of the metric",
    ", one can formulate the theory in a riemannian ( or riemann - cartan ) space - time .",
    "the corresponding conformal frame we call `` the einstein frame '' .",
    "the big advantage of tmt is that in the very wide class of models , _ the gravity and all matter fields equations of motion take canonical gr form in the einstein frame_. all the novelty of tmt in the einstein frame as compared with the standard gr is revealed only in an unusual structure of the scalar fields effective potential ( produced in the einstein frame ) , masses of fermions and their interactions with scalar fields as well as in the unusual structure of fermion contributions to the energy - momentum tensor : all these quantities appear to be @xmath45 dependent .",
    "this is why the scalar field @xmath46 determined by the constraint as a function of matter fields , has a key role in dynamics of tmt models .",
    "the tmt models possessing a global scale invariance@xcite are of significant interest because they demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry .",
    "in fact , if the action ( [ s ] ) is scale invariant then this classical field theory effect results from eq.([varphi ] ) , namely from solving the equation of motion ( [ varphib ] ) or ( [ adl1 ] ) . one of the interesting applications of the scale invariant tmt models@xcite is a possibility to generate the exponential potential for the scalar field @xmath0 by means of the mentioned spontaneous symmetry breaking even without introducing any potentials for @xmath0 in the lagrangians @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the action ( [ s ] ) . some cosmological applications of this effect have been also studied in ref.@xcite .    in order to show that tmt is able to provide a realistic results for gravity and particle physics , we present here a model with the @xmath47 gauge structure as in the standard model ( with standard content of the bosonic sector : gauge vector fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 and higgs doublet @xmath50 ) .",
    "although fermions ( as well as gauge bosons ) have no relation to the scalar sector dynamics studied in the present paper we include also fermions for two reasons : the first is to show that there exists a regime where the einstein gr and regular particle physics are realized simultaneously ( see appendix d ) ; the second reason is to show that the higgs field implements all what it does in the standard model .",
    "we start from only one family of the so called `` primordial '' fermionic fields and @xmath51(exact definition of this term is explained in the last paragraph of the next subsection ) : the primordial electron @xmath52 and neutrino @xmath53 . just as in the standard @xmath47 gauge invariant model",
    ", we will proceed with the following independent fermionic degrees of freedom : one primordial left lepton su(2 ) doublet @xmath54 and right primordial singlets @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , a dilaton field @xmath0 is needed in order to realize a spontaneously broken global scale invariance@xcite .",
    "it governs the evolution of the universe on different stages : in the early universe @xmath0 plays the role of inflaton and in the late time universe it is transformed into a part of the dark energy .",
    "according to the general prescriptions of tmt , we have to start from studying the self - consistent system of gravity and matter fields proceeding in the first order formalism . in the model including fermions in curved space - time , this means that the independent dynamical degrees of freedom are : all matter fields , vierbein @xmath57 , spin - connection @xmath58 and the measure @xmath12 degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath20 or @xmath23 .",
    "we postulate that in addition to @xmath47 gauge symmetry , the theory is invariant under the global scale transformations : @xmath59 if the definition ( [ aabg ] ) is used for the measure @xmath12 then the transformations of @xmath20 in ( [ stferm ] ) should be changed by @xmath60 .",
    "this global scale invariance includes the shift symmetry@xcite of the dilaton @xmath0 and this is the main factor why it is important for cosmological applications of the theory@xcite .",
    "we choose an action which , except for the modification of the general structure caused by the basic assumptions of tmt , _ does not contain any exotic terms and fields_. keeping the general structure ( [ s ] ) , it is convenient to represent the action in the following form : @xmath61 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\int d^{4}x e^{2\\alpha\\phi /m_{p}}[\\phi v_{1}(h ) + \\sqrt{-g}v_{2}(h ) ] + \\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g}l_{gauge } + \\int d^{4}x e^{\\alpha\\phi /m_{p}}(\\phi",

    "there are two types of the gravitational terms and of the `` kinetic - like terms '' ( both for the scalar fields and for the primordial fermionic ones ) which respect the scale invariance : the terms of the one type coupled to the measure @xmath12 and those of the other type coupled to the measure @xmath13 .",
    "for the same reason there are two different sets of the yukawa - like coupling terms of the primordial fermions . using the freedom in normalization of the measure fields ( @xmath20 in the case of using eq.([phi ] ) or @xmath23 when using eq.([aabg ] ) )",
    ", we set the coupling constant of the scalar curvature to the measure @xmath12 to be @xmath79 . normalizing all the fields such that their couplings to the measure @xmath12 have no additional factors , we are not able in general to provide the same in terms describing the appropriate couplings to the measure @xmath13 . this fact explains the need to introduce the dimensionless real parameters @xmath80 and we will only assume that _ they have close orders of magnitudes_. the real positive parameter @xmath81 is assumed to be of the order of unity ; in all solutions presented in this paper we set @xmath82 . for newton",
    "constant we use @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "one should also point out the possibility of introducing two different potential - like exponential functions of the dilaton @xmath0 coupled to the measures @xmath12 and @xmath13 with factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 must be @xmath0-independent to provide the scale symmetry ( [ stferm ] )",
    ". however they can be higgs - dependent and then they play the role of the higgs pre - potentials ( we will see below how the effective potential of the scalar sector is generated in the einstein frame ) .",
    "the choice of the action ( [ totaction ] ) needs a few additional explanations :    \\1 ) with the aim to simplify the analysis of the results of the model ( containing too many free parameters ) we have chosen the coefficient @xmath89 in front of @xmath13 in the first integral of ( [ totaction ] ) to be a common factor of the gravitational term @xmath90 and of the kinetic term for the higgs field @xmath50 . except for the simplification",
    "there are no reasons for such a fine tuned choice .",
    "\\2 ) we choose the kinetic terms of the gauge bosons in the conformal invariant form which is possible only if these terms are coupled to the measure @xmath13 . introducing the coupling of these terms to the measure @xmath12 would lead to the nonlinear field strength dependence in the gauge fields equations of motion as well as to non positivity of the energy .",
    "another consequence is a possibility of certain unorthodox effects , like space - time variations of the effective fine structure constant .",
    "\\3 ) one can show that for achieving the right chiral structure of the fermion sector in the einstein frame , one has to choose in ( [ totaction ] ) the coupling of the kinetic terms of all the left and right primordial fermions to the measures @xmath13 and @xmath12 to be universal .",
    "this feature is displayed in the choice of the parameter @xmath2 to be the common factor in front of the corresponding kinetic terms for all primordial fermion degrees of freedom .    except for these three items , eq.([totaction ] ) describes _ the most general action of tmt satisfying the formulated above symmetries_.      in appendix a we present the equations of motion resulting from the action ( [ totaction ] ) when using the original set of variables . in appendix b one can find the equation and solution for the spin - connection .",
    "the common feature of all the equations in the original frame is that the measure @xmath12 degrees of freedom appear only through dependence upon the scalar field @xmath45 , eq.([zeta ] ) . in particular , all the equations of motion and the solution for the spin - connection include terms proportional to @xmath91 , that makes space - time non riemannian and all equations of motion - noncanonical .",
    "it turns out that with the set of the new variables ( @xmath0 , @xmath50 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 remain the same ) @xmath92 which we call the einstein frame , the spin - connections become those of the einstein - cartan space - time , see appendix c. since @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are invariant under the scale transformations ( [ stferm ] ) , spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ( by means of eq.(4 ) which for our model ( [ totaction ] ) takes the form ( [ app1 ] ) ) is reduced in the new variables to the _ spontaneous breakdown of the shift symmetry _",
    "@xmath96 notice that the goldstone theorem generically is not applicable in this sector of the theory@xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "in fact , the shift symmetry ( [ phiconst ] ) leads to a conserved dilatation current @xmath97 . however , for example in the spatially flat frw universe the spatial components of the current @xmath98 behave as @xmath99 as @xmath100 . due to this anomalous behavior at infinity , there is a flux of the current leaking to infinity , which causes the non conservation of the dilatation charge .",
    "the absence of the latter implies that one of the conditions necessary for the goldstone theorem is missing .",
    "the non conservation of the dilatation charge is similar to the well known effect of instantons in qcd where singular behavior in the spatial infinity leads to the absence of the goldstone boson associated to the @xmath101 symmetry .    after the change of variables to the einstein frame",

    "it is straightforward now to construct linear combinations of the gauge fields to produce the electromagnetic field @xmath132 and",
    "@xmath133 and @xmath134 bosons .    one can show that not only in the case of the @xmath47 gauge theory but also in more general gauge theories , like gut , gauge fields equations of motion in the einstein frame ( in tmtf ) coincide with the appropriate equations of the standard field theory approach to the gauge theory .",
    "therefore after the higgs field develops a non zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the higgs phenomenon takes place here exactly in the same manner as in the standard approach to the unified gauge theories : fermions and part of the gauge degrees of freedom become massive ( see eqs.([muferm1 ] ) , ( [ lf - eff - ein ] ) and ( [ gauge - ein ] ) ) .",
    "hence , @xmath135 gauge model serves an illustrative example that in spite of the very specific general structure of the tmt action ( [ totaction ] ) , the scalar field @xmath50 ( or @xmath1 in the unitary gauge ) indeed plays the role of the higgs field .",
    "however the detailed mechanism by means of which the symmetry breaking is implemented in tmt may be very much different from how it is done in the standard gauge theories .",
    "in particular , we are going to show that it can be done without a tachyonic mass term in the action .    applying constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) to eq.([phief+ferm1 ] )",

    "is used to in normal field theory .",
    "for example the fermion mass can depend upon the fermion density . in appendix d",
    "we show that if the local energy density of the fermion is many orders of magnitude larger than the vacuum energy density in the space - time region occupied by the fermion then the fermion can have a constant mass .",
    "however this is exactly the case of atomic , nuclear and particle physics , including accelerator physics and high density objects of astrophysics .",

    "in particular with our choice of the parameters , we have found that the transition from the gsb inflation to the gsr inflation ends about 50 e - folding before the end of inflation , and this result is practically independent of the initial conditions .",
    "we have checked by means of numerical solutions that in models with @xmath160 all the above conclusions are not affected , see figs.25 and 26 .",
    "this is clear enough because contributions of the terms with @xmath242 in equations of sec.iiia become negligible as the inflaton kinetic term is very small .",
    "but this is exactly what happens due to the attractor behavior of the phase trajectories .      to understand the mechanism responsible for the character of the attractor behavior of the phase trajectories ( observed in the numerical solution ) as they approach the point @xmath335 of the line @xmath390 in figs.18a and 19 , one should to take into account in eqs.([phi - dimensionless])-([x - dimensionless ] ) the inequalities ( [ gg ] ) which hold for @xmath391 . when doing this in a consistent way one can rewrite eqs.([phi - dimensionless ] ) and ( [ h - dimensionless ] ) , for @xmath392 , with high enough accuracy in the following simplified form @xmath393^{1/2}\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\tau } -\\frac{\\alpha}{2 } e^{-2\\alpha\\varphi } = 0 , \\label{phi - dimensionless - simple}\\ ] ] @xmath394^{1/2}\\frac{d\\tilde{\\upsilon}}{d\\tau } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_p}{m}\\right)^2(\\tilde{\\mu}_1 ^ 2+\\tilde{\\mu}_2 ^ 2)\\tilde{\\upsilon}=0 , \\label{h - dimensionless - simple}\\ ] ] while in the energy density @xmath375 in eq.([rho - dimensionless ] ) only the inflaton contribution has to be taken into account .",

    "therefore when trying to satisfy the initial conditions with natural , i.e. non anomalously large values of @xmath419 and @xmath420 , we obtain that @xmath421 is very close to zero . because of the extremely rapid decay of the second term , its contribution into the solution ( [ v(phi)-sol-1 ] ) quickly becomes negligible with growth of @xmath365 .",

    "the curves @xmath424 , which are the projections of the 4-dimensional phase trajectories on the @xmath425-plane , have the following characteristic features :    * from the beginning the solution @xmath426 remains almost constant in a long enough @xmath0-interval , that corresponds to the gsb stage of the inflation the analytic solution ( [ v(phi)-sol ] ) provides such a regime : the bessel function of the first kind @xmath417 starts from very small values and increases exponentially ; it turns out that the decaying exponential factor in eq.([v(phi)-sol ] ) compensates the growth of the bessel function @xmath417 with very high accuracy resulting in a very slow change of @xmath426 during an initial long enough stage of the power law inflation ( see fig.18a ) .",
    "note that in contrast to this the bessel function of the second kind @xmath427 decreases exponentially and therefore its product with the decaying exponential factor in eq.([v(phi)-sol-1 ] ) makes its relative contribution to the solution negligible very quickly .",
    "* analytic solutions @xmath426 with different initial conditions fall to the same point @xmath335 of the line @xmath428 , exactly as in the numerical solutions in sec.viib , figs.18a and 19 .",
    "but now we have the mathematical explanation of this effect : the point @xmath335 is the first zero of the bessel function . since the choice of the initial value @xmath419 determines only the appropriate value of the factor @xmath409 in eq.([v(phi)-sol ] ) , it becomes clear why independently of initial values @xmath419 all the phase trajectories fall to the same point @xmath335 .",
    "* after the point @xmath335 ( see figs.18a , 19 , 28 ) all the 4-dimensional phase trajectories approach the attractor @xmath429 whose projection on the @xmath430-plane we observe in figs.17a as the straight interval after the point @xmath431 . as we see in figs.19 , 28 , approaches to this attractor occur through the very strong damping of the oscillations of the higgs field around its zero value .",
    "note also that locations of all the zeros of the bessel function @xmath417 are determined only by the parameters of the model and are independent of the initial conditions .",
    "after the point @xmath432 , the presented analytic solution is not applicable since the inequality([gg ] ) does not hold for @xmath433 and therefore ignoring the back reaction of the higgs field on the inflaton dynamics does not hold anymore .",
    "the fall of all the phase trajectories ( corresponding to different initial conditions ) to the same point @xmath335 of the attractor @xmath434 , along with the attractor behavior with respect to @xmath435 , has a decisive role in the observed effect : the magnitudes of @xmath301 and @xmath268 where @xmath1 and @xmath0 stop in the vacuum manifold ( [ min - v ] ) depend very weak of the initial conditions .",
    "in fact , if different phase trajectories would fall to different points of the attractor @xmath434 then the degree of damping of their oscillations right before they enter into the regime of the last phase transition ( region @xmath338 in fig.18a ) could be generically very different . those of them whose deviations from the attractor were not small would have the limiting point @xmath436 of the phase transition significantly different from others .",
    "the cosmological scenario studied in this section includes a number of dynamical effects demonstrating a strong enough tendency of the inflaton and higgs fields to coexistence and interference .",
    "this is why we will refer to the appropriate phenomena as higgs - inflaton symbiosis ( his ) .",
    "the dynamics of the his model resembles the hybrid inflation model@xcite but there are essential differences .",
    "hybrid inflation models@xcite contain more than one scalar fields one of which ( the inflaton @xmath0 ) drives the early ( long ) stage of inflation and the dynamics of the other(s ) determines the character of the final ( very short ) stage of inflation .",
    "one usually assumes@xcite that the extra scalar @xmath296 is the higgs field . due to a direct inflaton - higgs coupling the higgs",
    "effective mass is @xmath0 dependent . during the early stage of inflation",
    "the higgs effective mass square is positive and may be very large .",
    "this is the reason why the higgs field is in the false vacuum @xmath437 during the early stage of inflation .",
    "afterwards , slow roll of the inflaton below a certain value causes the change of the sign of the higgs effective mass square . in other words",
    ", the inflaton plays the role of a trigger which causes transition of the higgs field into the true minimum of the scalar sector potential in the higgs direction .",
    "this transition starts _ before _ the end of inflation because locations of the minima in the directions of the inflaton and the higgs field do not coincide .",
    "the end of inflation and spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry appears to be intrinsically correlated : the last stages of inflation are supported not by the inflaton potential @xmath438 but by the `` noninflationary '' potential @xmath439 . to provide a desirable scenario",
    "there is a need in strong enough restrictions on the parameters of the model .",
    "note also that this type of models preserves the original feature of the standard approach to gauge symmetry breaking - the presence of a tachyonic mass term in the action .",
    "here we summarize the main features of the his model including a number of differences from hybrid inflation models .",
    "* incorporation of both the inflation and the gauge symmetry breaking is achieved _ without tachyonic mass _ terms in the original action ( see eqs.([totaction ] ) and ( [ v1v2higgs]),([m2>0 ] ) ) . * the inflaton - higgs coupling in eq.([veff+higgs ] ) disappears in the inflationary epoch , i.e as the inflaton @xmath239 , see eq.([veff+higgs - early ] ) .",
    "therefore the _ effective higgs mass is constant during the inflation_. * the positivity of the effective mass square of the higgs field in the inflationary epoch ( see eq.([veff+higgs - early ] ) ) results directly from the positivity of the original mass square parameters @xmath440 and @xmath441 in the pre - potentials , eqs.([v1v2higgs]),([m2>0 ] ) .",
    "* as a direct result of tmt , the effective scalar sector potential ( [ veff+higgs ] ) has a structure which provides automatically a _ common location _ of the minima in the inflaton and the higgs field directions .",
    "these minima form the line ( [ min - v ] ) in the plane @xmath442 .",
    "each point of this line describes a gauge symmetry broken state with zero vacuum energy density . instead of resorting to tachyonic mass terms ,",
    "these minima are achieved by assigning negative values to the constant parts @xmath443 , @xmath444 of the pre - potentials , eqs.([v1v2higgs]),([m2>0 ] ) .",
    "* constancy of the effective higgs mass during a significant part of the early stage of inflation allows for the higgs field @xmath1 to remain practically equal to its initial value when the hubble parameter is very large ( gsb inflation ) .",
    "* the fall of the higgs field to the state @xmath9 ( gsr inflation ) occurs at a quite definite value of the e - folding before the end of inflation .",
    "this value of the e - folding is practically independent of the initial conditions . * after falling to @xmath9 the higgs field performs quickly damping oscillations around @xmath9 .",
    "* at the end of inflation ( i.e. when @xmath445 ) all the phase trajectories corresponding to different initial conditions appear to be very close to the attractor @xmath446 .",
    "* the effective mass square of the higgs field _ becomes negative after the end of inflation_. exponential form of the @xmath0 dependence in eq.([veff+higgs ] ) makes this trigger effect very sharp .",
    "the demonstrated extreme closeness of all phase trajectories ( corresponding to different initial conditions ) to the attractor provides that the phase transition to the gauge symmetry broken phase occurs into a very short interval of the values of @xmath343 ( and appropriate values of @xmath379 ) in the vacuum manifold([min - v ] ) .",
    "* the remarkable structure of the scalar sector effective potential ( [ veff+higgs ] ) ( generated in the einstein frame in our tmt model ) automatically provides that the effective potential in the vacuum manifold ( [ min - v ] ) is equal to zero without fine tuning of the parameters of the action and the initial conditions .",
    "* note finally that in contrast with the hybrid inflation models where strong enough restrictions on the parameters are needed , in the his model qualitatively the same results are obtained in a very broad range of the parameters satisfying the conditions ( [ m2>0 ] ) , ( [ bmu1>bmu2 ] ) .      in the previous sections we did not touch quantum effects and their possible role in the studied processes .",
    "one of the most important quantum effects is the particle creation .",
    "here we want to discuss on the qualitative level what kind of influence one can expect from the particle creation on the studied processes . in our qualitative discussion",
    "we have to take into account that in the his evolution there are _ two very different stages where oscillations of the higgs field must cause matter creation_.",
    "\\(1 ) _ the first oscillatory stage _",
    "consists of the transition from gsb to gsr inflation and the gsr inflation itself .",
    "a rapid transition of the higgs field from a nonzero value to the @xmath9 phase has to be accompanied with particle creation .",
    "the subsequent coherent damping oscillations of the higgs field around @xmath9 , studied in detail in secs.viib and viic must be responsible for creation of massless particles , like for example _ massless gauge bosons_. this dissipative process results in an additional damping of the higgs field oscillations .",
    "hence the quantum effect of particle creation acts here as an additional factor which forces the phase trajectories corresponding to different initial conditions to achieve closer unification with the attractor @xmath447 . as a result of this the final values of @xmath343 and @xmath379 in the symmetry broken phase",
    "become more strongly independent of the initial conditions than in the pure classical model discussed in the preceding subsections .",
    "one should note that with the chosen parameters , the reheating caused by the first stage of the particle creation can not play an essential role in the thermal history of the universe because it happens about 50 e - folding before the end of inflation .",
    "however possible effect of the appropriate thermal fluctuations on the primordial density perturbations perhaps deserves a special study .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the second stage of the particle creation _ is realized after the end of inflation during the transition from @xmath434 phase to the gauge symmetry broken phase .",
    "coherent oscillations of the higgs field around the vacuum manifold discussed in detail in sec .",
    "viib may serve as a very effective mechanism of the preheating , for example via gauge bosons creation .",
    "this effect has to be studied in detail , but it is beyond the goals of this paper .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to point out that _ the back reaction of the particle creation _ on the finish of the phase transition may be very important . indeed , as we discussed in the preceding subsections , the characteristic feature of the final stage of the classical evolution of the higgs - inflaton system is that the scalar sector energy density @xmath10 approaches zero .",
    "if there is no other matter , the friction @xmath448 caused by the cosmological expansion also approaches zero and therefore the finish of the classical evolution of the higgs - inflaton system becomes problematic ( see item 8 in sec.viib ) .",
    "however , if one takes into account the quantum effects of matter creation due to the higgs field oscillations around the vacuum manifold , this immediately produces additional friction in the higgs field equation non related to the cosmological expansion . besides , the presence of massive gauge bosons , photons and fermions in addition to the scalar sector ( the energy density of the latter is very close to zero )",
    "means that the universe has entered into a radiation / matter dominated era .",
    "therefore the friction caused by the cosmological expansion ( both in the inflaton and in the higgs field equations ) is now @xmath449 where @xmath450 includes also the radiation / matter energy density . due to these two back reaction effects the higgs and inflaton fields",
    "must quickly dissipate their kinetic energy and the evolution of the higgs - inflaton system has to finish in a certain point of the vacuum manifold which is practically independent of the initial conditions .",
    "one should finally point out that in this paper we have restricted ourselves only with a homogeneous distribution of the initial values of the higgs field .",
    "however the discussed practical independence of @xmath343 of the initial conditions in the framework of the homogeneous problem may serve as an indication that in a more realistic case of inhomogeneous distribution of the initial values of the higgs field , its value in the final gauge symmetry broken phase will be practically the same everywhere in our universe .",
    "the main idea of tmt is that the general form of the action @xmath451 is not enough in order to account for some of the fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the key difference of tmt from the standard field theory in curved space - time consists in the hypothesis@xcite-@xcite that in addition to the term in the action with the volume element @xmath18 there should be one more term where the volume element is metric independent but rather it is determined either by four ( in the 4-dimensional space - time ) scalar fields @xmath20 or by a three index potential @xmath23 , see eqs.([s])-([aabg ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that including in the action of tmt the coupling of the lagrangian density @xmath27 with the measure @xmath12 , we modify in general both the gravitational and matter sectors as compared with the standard field theory in curved space - time . besides we made two more assumptions :",
    "the measure fields ( @xmath20 or @xmath23 ) appear only in the volume element ; one should proceed in the first order formalism . _",
    "these assumptions constitute all the modifications of the general structure of the theory we have made as compared with the standard field theory in curved space - time_. in fact , the lagrangian densities @xmath27 and @xmath16 in the models we have studied in the present paper , contain all types of terms which should be present if the standard model would be formulated in curved space - time . however we do not consider any exotic terms and it turns out that there is _ no need for any exotic term _ in order to achieve desirable results .",
    "in particular there is no need for the phantom type terms in @xmath27 and @xmath16 in order to obtain super - acceleration at the late time universe ; there is no need for tachyonic mass terms in the higgs pre - potentials @xmath87 and @xmath88 in order to obtain spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry .    after making use of the variational principle and formulating the resulting equations in the einstein frame ,",
    "we have seen that in the absence of fermions , the dynamics of the scalar sector is described by the effective action ( [ k - eff ] ) which is a concrete realization of the @xmath2-essence@xcite obtained from first principles .        for pedagogical reasons in secs.iv-vi",

    "from the summary of the main features of the his ( see sec .",
    "viid ) one can conclude that our tmt model implies a _ new cosmological mechanism for a transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase soon after the end of inflation_. from the field theory point of view ,",
    "one of the advantages of the model is that the gauge symmetry breaking is obtained _ without tachyonic mass terms _ in the original action .",
    "another important advantage of the model is that the inflaton driven transition to the the gauge symmetry broken phase is automatically ( i.e. without tuning ) accompanied with approaching zero of the scalar sector energy density . from the point of view of the realistic cosmology , the scenario based on the his model exhibits a new mechanism of reheating which most likely may be very effective : coherent oscillations of the higgs field must result in intensive creation of the gauge bosons .",
    "besides , transition to the gauge symmetry broken phase starts soon after the end of the gsr inflation where @xmath456 and therefore masses of quantum of all the gauge fields are very close to zero at the beginning of the reheating .      _ the old cosmological constant problem_. in secs.vi and vii , we have seen in details that if @xmath457 then , for a broad range of other parameters , the vacuum energy turns out to be zero without fine tuning ; this is possible both in the model with @xmath0 as the scalar sector and in the model with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is a direct consequence of the result of the tmt : the effective scalar sector potential generated in the einstein frame is proportional to _ a perfect square_. if such type of the structure for the scalar field potential in a usual ( non tmt ) model would be chosen `` by hand '' it would be a sort of fine tuning .    there is a need to explain how this result avoids the well known no - go theorem by weinberg@xcite stating that generically in field theory one can not have zero value of the potential in the minimum without fine tuning .",
    "the reason why this theorem is not applicable here is that one of the basic assumptions of the theorem does not hold . indeed in the mentioned theorem",
    ", it is assumed that all fields in the vacuum are constants . in our case ,",
    "the basic assumption that the measure of integration in the action @xmath36 implies that all the measure fields ( @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) in the definition ( [ phi ] ) or @xmath23 in the definition ( [ aabg ] ) ) have non vanishing space - time gradients .",

    "\\1 ) recall first two fundamental facts of tmt as a classical field theory : ( a ) the measure degrees of freedom appear in the equations of motion only via the scalar @xmath45 , eq.([zeta ] ) ; ( b ) the scalar @xmath45 is determined by the constraint which is nothing but a consistency condition of the equations of motion ( see eqs.([app1 ] ) , ( [ app3 ] ) and ( [ app4 ] ) in appendix b )",
    ". therefore the constraint plays a key role in tmt .",
    "note however that if we were ignore the gravity from the very beginning in the action ( [ totaction ] ) then instead of the constraint ( [ app4 ] ) we would obtain eq.([app1 ] ) ( where one has to put zero the scalar curvature ) .",
    "in such a case we would deal with a different theory .",
    "this notion shows that the gravity and matter intertwined in tmt in a much more complicated manner than in gr . hence introducing the new measure of integration @xmath12 we have to expect that the quantization of tmt may be a complicated enough problem .",
    "nevertheless we would like here to point out that in the light of the recently proposed idea of ref.@xcite , the incorporation of four scalar fields @xmath461 together with the scalar density @xmath12 , eq.([phi ] ) , ( which in our case are the measure fields and the new measure of integration respectively ) , is a possible way to define local observables in the local quantum field theory approach to quantum gravity .",
    "we regard this result as an indication that the effective gravity @xmath462 matter field theory has to contain the new measure of integration @xmath12 as it is in tmt .",
    "\\2 ) the assumption formulated in item 2 in sec.iia , that the measure fields @xmath461 ( or @xmath23 ) appear in the action ( [ s ] ) _ only _ via the measure of integration @xmath12 , has a key role in the tmt results and in particular for the resolution of the old cosmological constant problem , see sec.vi . in principle",
    "one can think of breakdown of such a structure by quantum corrections .",
    "however , fortunately there exists an infinite dimensional symmetry mentioned in item 2 of sec.iia which , as we hope , is able to protect the postulated structure of the action from a deformation caused by quantum corrections or at least to suppress such a quantum anomaly in significant degree",
    ". therefore one can hope that the proposed resolution of the old cosmological constant problem holds in the quantized tmt as well .",
    "\\3 ) as we have noticed in sec.viia , the vacuum manifold ( [ min - v ] ) of the his is degenerate : the effective potential of the scalar sector remains equal to zero when shifting along this line in the @xmath442 plane .",
    "however this degeneracy has no relation to any symmetry of the action , and in particular the kinetic energy of the scalar sector does not respect this shift as a symmetry .",
    "therefore there are no reasons for quantum corrections not to break this shift symmetry of the vacuum manifold .",
    "disappearance of the degeneracy of the vacuum manifold provides us with two important conclusions : a ) our model is out of danger to run against the problem of the appearance of a pseudo - goldstone boson ; b ) transition to the gauge symmetry broken phase will end in a certain point @xmath463 instead of a short interval of the line ( [ min - v ] ) as it was in the pure classical problem studied in sec.vii .",
    "\\4 ) recall finally that such quantum effects as the first and the second stages of particle creation discussed in details in sec.viie , supplement and strengthen the obtained classical results : the first stage of particle creation allows to hope that vev of the higgs field is independent of the initial conditions ; the second stage of particle creation should work as a mechanism of dissipation responsible for realization of the final state of the his in the gauge symmetry broken phase .",

    "we will proceed choosing the parameters @xmath507 , @xmath508 and/or @xmath218 as in sec.iv .",
    "it is convenient to divide the analysis into a few steps :    \\(1 ) it follows from the condition @xmath509 that @xmath510 determined by the constraint in the absence of fermions case , eq.([zeta - without - ferm - delta=0 ] ) , has the same order of magnitude as the parameter @xmath218 .",

    "@xmath45 _ has the order of magnitude close to that of the parameter",
    "_ @xmath218 ( if no special tuning is assumed and in particular @xmath513 ) , the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) of the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) has the order of magnitude close to that of @xmath511 , eq.([veff1 ] ) , i.e. _ the l.h.s . of the constraint has the order of magnitude close to that of the dark energy density in the absence of fermions case_.",
    "\\(4 ) let us now turn to the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) in the presence of a single massive primordial fermion .",
    "it contains factor @xmath514 , ( @xmath115 ) which have typical order of magnitude of the fermion canonical energy density @xmath515 .",
    "if the primordial fermion is in a state of a regular fermion then according to the conclusion made at the end of the previous subsection , in the space - time region where the fermion is localized , the scalar @xmath45 must be @xmath516 ( or @xmath517 ) .",
    "therefore in the space - time region occupied by a single regular fermion , the r.h.s . of ( [ constraint2 ] )",
    "is @xmath518    due to our assumption that the dimensionless parameters @xmath218 , @xmath152 , @xmath2 , @xmath519 and @xmath520 have close orders of magnitude ( see paragraph after eq.([lgauge ] ) ) , it follows from the definitions ( [ zeta ] ) that both @xmath521 and @xmath522 have the order of magnitude close to that of @xmath218 .",
    "hence in the space - time region occupied by a single regular fermion , the l.h.s . of ( [ constraint2 ] ) has the order of magnitude close to that of the dark energy density in the fermion vacuum .",
    "it is evident that _ in normal particle physics conditions _",
    "( see the last paragraph of sec.ii ) , that is when the energy density of a single fermion @xmath523 is tens of orders of magnitude larger than the fermion vacuum energy density , the balance dictated by the constraint is satisfied in the present day universe just due to the condition ( [ z-0 ] ) .",
    "5 in more general cases , i.e. when primordial fermion is in a state different from the regular one , the meaning of the constraint is similar : _ the balance between the scalar dark energy contribution to the l.h.s . of the constraint and the fermionic contribution to the r.h.s . of the constraint _",
    "is realized due to the factors @xmath113 . in other words , _ the constraint describes the local balance between the fermion energy density and the scalar dark energy density _ in the space - time region where the wave function of the primordial fermion is not equal to zero ; _ by means of this balance the constraint determines the scalar _ @xmath524 .",
    "note also that due to this balance , _ the degree of localization of the fermion and values of @xmath524 may be strongly interconnected_.    one can suggest the following two alternative approaches to the question of how a primordial fermion can be realized as a regular one :    _ the first approach _ discussed in refs.@xcite , @xcite , is based on the idea of the `` maximal economy '' .",
    "we start from one primordial fermion field for each type of fermions : one neutral primordial lepton field @xmath53 , one charged primordial lepton field @xmath52 and similar for quarks . in other words",
    "we start from one generation of fermions .",
    "splitting of the primordial fermions into families occurs only in normal particle physics conditions , i.e. when the fermion energy density is huge in comparison with the vacuum energy density .",
    "one of the possibilities for this to be realized is the above mentioned condition @xmath525 .",
    "the appropriate two constant solutions for @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath526 , correspond to two different states of the primordial fermions with _ different constant masses _",
    "determined eqs.([muferm1 ] ) where we have to substitute @xmath506 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "so , in the normal particle physics conditions , the scalar @xmath45 plays the role of an additional degree of freedom determining different mass eigenstates of the primordial fermions which we want to identify with different fermion generations .",
    "note that the classical tests of gr deal in fact with matter built of the fermions of the first generation ( may be with a small touch of the second generation ) .",
    "this is why one can identify the states of the primordial fermions realized as @xmath527 with the first two generations of the regular fermions .",
    "for example , if the free primordial electron @xmath52 is in the state with @xmath528 ( or @xmath529 ) , it is detected as the regular electron @xmath530 ( or muon @xmath531 ) and similar the primordial neutrino @xmath53 splits into the regular electron and muon neutrinos with masses respectively : @xmath532 it turns out that there is only one more additional possibility to satisfy the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) when primordial fermion is in the normal particle physics conditions .",
    "this is the solution @xmath533 which one can associate with the third generation of fermions ( for details see refs.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that in contrast to the first two generations , the third generation defined by this way , may have gravitational interaction with unusual features since the condition ( [ noncan - ll - can ] ) may not hold .",
    "the described splitting of the primordial fermions into three generations in the normal particle physics conditions is the family replication mechanism proposed in refs.@xcite , @xcite .    _",
    "the second approach _ is based on the idea that the three families of fermions of the standard model exist from the beginning in the original action , i.e. not to use the family replication mechanism for explanation of the observed three generations of fermions . in this case",
    "again , exactly as it was in the first approach , the primordial fermions turn into the regular fermions only in the normal particle physics conditions .",
    "now however if we interpret the state of the primordial fermions with , for example , @xmath534 as the observable regular fermions , then some role should be assigned to the states with @xmath535 and @xmath536 . by means of a choice of the parameters one can try for example to provide very large masses of the regular fermions with @xmath535 and @xmath536 that might explain the reason why they are unobservable so far .",
    "however these questions are beyond of the goals of this paper and together with many other aspects of fermions in tmt will be studied in a separate publication .",
    "reproducing einstein equations when the primordial fermions are in the states of the regular fermions is not enough in order to assert that gr is reproduced .",
    "the reason is that at the late universe , as @xmath537 , the scalar field @xmath0 effective potential is very flat and therefore due to the yukawa - type coupling of massive fermions to @xmath0 , ( the r.h.s . of eq.([phief+ferm1 ] ) ) , the long range scalar force appears to be possible in general .",
    "the yukawa coupling `` constant '' is @xmath538 .",
    "applying our analysis of the meaning of the constraint in two previous subsections , it is easy to see that for regular fermions with @xmath539 the factor @xmath113 is of the order of the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the regular fermion energy density .",
    "thus we conclude that the 5-th force is extremely suppressed for the fermionic matter observable in classical tests of gr .",
    "it is very important that this result is obtained automatically , without tuning of the parameters and it takes place for both approaches to realization of the regular fermions in tmt discussed in previous subsection .",
    "the results of the previous three sections depend very much on the choice of the parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath242 in the action ( [ totaction ] ) .",
    "let us recall that the curvature term in the action ( [ totaction ] ) couples to the measure @xmath540 while the @xmath0 kinetic term couples to the measure @xmath541 .",
    "this is the reason of @xmath160 .",
    "if we were choose the fine tuned condition @xmath542 then both the curvature term and the @xmath0 kinetic term would be coupled to the same measure @xmath543 .",
    "one can also pay attention that depending on the choice of one of the alternative conditions @xmath171 or @xmath171 we realize different shapes of the effective potential if @xmath170 ( see fig.1 ) . and again , if instead we were choose the fine tuned condition @xmath185 then the action would contain only one prepotential coupled to the measure @xmath540 .",
    "so , in order to avoid fine tunings we have introduced asymmetries in the couplings of the different terms in the lagrangian densities @xmath27 and @xmath16 to measures @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in order to display the role of these asymmetries",
    "it is useful to consider what happens if such asymmetries are absent in the action at all . in other words",
    "we want to study the gravity+dilaton model where both @xmath158 and @xmath185 .",
    "in such a case the action contains only one lagrangian density coupled to the measure @xmath543 : @xmath544 where @xmath545 .",
    "an equivalent statement is that @xmath546 ; it is an example of the very special class of the tmt models where @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath16 .    to see the cosmological dynamics in this model one can use the results of sec.iiib .",
    "if we assume in addition @xmath169 and @xmath184 , then after the shift @xmath547 where @xmath548 ( which is not a shift symmetry in this case ) , the effective potential ( [ veffvac - delta=0 ] ) takes the form @xmath549 in contrast to general cases ( @xmath550 ) this potential has no flat regions and it is symmetric around a certain point in the @xmath0-axis .",

    "it follows from eqs.([toy-1-phi ] ) and ( [ toy-1-gmunu ] ) that @xmath571 this result holds in both model .    in the model ( [ toy-1 ] ) , variation of @xmath296 results in @xmath572 which is consistent with eq.([toy - constr ] ) only if the integration constant @xmath573 .",

    "this means that the model ( [ toy-1 ] ) with auxiliary ( nondynamical ) field @xmath296 intrinsically contains a constant vacuum energy .    in the model ( [ toy-2 ] ) , where @xmath296 appears as a dynamical field , the gravitational equations in the einstein frame results from eq.([toy-1-gmunu ] ) @xmath576",
    "it is convenient to rewrite this equation in terms of the scalar field @xmath577 : @xmath578 the @xmath0-equation reads @xmath579 .",
    "similar to the general discussion in the main text we see that if the @xmath296 field is dynamical then tmt provides the vacuum with zero energy without fine tuning .",
    "however it is very unlikely that a nondynamical scalar field will not acquire a kinetic term after quantum corrections@xcite .",
    "then it becomes dynamical which restores the above results for the model ( [ toy-2 ] ) .",
    "this is why we have ignored the rather formal possibility of introducing the nondynamical scalars into the fundamental action of the models studied in this paper .",
