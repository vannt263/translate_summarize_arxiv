    "brownian motion in periodic and random potentials has been a very active area of research for many decades .",
    "apart from the well established applications to electronics @xcite and to solid state physics such as superionic conductors , the josephson tunneling junction @xcite and surface diffusion  @xcite , new and exciting applications to physics ( self - assembled molecular film growth , catalysis , surface - bound nanostructures ) and to biology ( stochastic modeling of molecular and brownian motors  @xcite ) keep the subject of brownian motion at the forefront of current research , both theoretical and experimental .    despite the fact that brownian motion in periodic potentials has been studied extensively  ( * ? ? ?",
    "11 ) , @xcite and many analytical and numerical results have been obtained , there are still many open questions , in particular in the underdamped , multidimensional case .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop a general method for calculating the diffusion tensor @xmath0 of the brownian particle in arbitrary dimensions , and to then use this method for setting up an efficient numerical method for computing @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we will show that our method for calculating @xmath0 will enable us to study various asymptotic limits of physical interest in a systematic and rigorous fashion .",
    "the dynamics of a brownian particle moving in a periodic potential is governed by the langevin equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the particle position , @xmath3 is a smooth periodic potential , @xmath4 denotes the friction coefficient and @xmath5 is a white noise gaussian process with correlation function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 is the absolute temperature , in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we use the notation @xmath9 to denote ensemble average . we will also write @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a standard brownian motion in @xmath13 . throughout this work",
    "we will assume that the diffusing particle is of unit mass , @xmath14 .",
    "the langevin equation   has been studied extensively as a theoretical model for the diffusion of adsorbates on crystal surfaces  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , @xmath15 represents the position of the diffusing particle , @xmath16 the substrate potential and the friction and noise terms represent the interaction of the diffusing particle with the phonon heat bath  @xcite    it is well known that at low temperatures ( which is usually the regime of physical interest ) , the diffusing particle performs a hopping motion ( random walk ) between the local minima of the potential .",
    "this hopping motion is characterized by the mean square jump length @xmath17 and the hopping rate @xmath18 ( or , equivalently , the mean escape time @xmath19 with @xmath20 ) .",
    "these two quantities are related to the diffusion coefficient through the formula ( in one dimension ) @xmath21 knowledge of two of the three quantities @xmath22 is sufficient for the calculation of the third .",
    "of course , the diffusion tensor can also be defined either in terms of the ensemble average of the second moment , i.e. @xmath23 or in terms of the time integral of the velocity autocorrelation function , i.e. through the green - kubo formula @xmath24 with @xmath25 . in the above formulas @xmath26 stands for the tensor product between two vectors in @xmath13 .",
    "we remark that , although formulas   and   are valid in arbitrary dimensions , it is not clear how to interpret formula   in dimensions higher than @xmath27 .    of particular interest",
    "is the dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 as well as the jump rate @xmath18 and ( mean square ) jump length @xmath28 on the friction coefficient . in particular , it is well known that in the underdamped regime the particle diffusion is dominated by the occurrence of long jumps  @xcite .",
    "apart from theoretical investigations and numerical simulations based on the langevin dynamics  , the occurrence of long jumps in the underdamped regime is also verified by means of molecular dynamics simulations of a model for co / ni@xmath29  @xcite and is also , by now , a well established experimental result  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of weak adsorbate - substrate interaction i.e. in the case of weak coupling between the diffusing particle and the heat bath which corresponds to the underdamped dynamics regime , the diffusion mechanism is controlled by long jumps , spanning multiple lattice spacings  @xcite .",
    "the rigorous and systematic study of the diffusion process in the weak dissipation regime is still a major challenge for theoreticians , in particular in dimensions higher than @xmath27 .    the problem of diffusion in periodic potentials is well studied in one dimension  @xcite or for separable potentials in two and three dimensions  @xcite",
    "kramers theory  @xcite applied to brownian motion in a periodic potential or the mean first passage time method  @xcite enables us to calculate the rate of escape from a local minimum of the potential ( hopping rate ) . in the overdamped limit",
    "this is sufficient to calculate the diffusion coefficient , since only single jumps occur and consequently @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the period of the potential .",
    "this leads to the well known lifson - jackson formula for the diffusion coefficient  @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 13 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the diffusion coefficient of the free particle @xmath35 kramers formula for the rate of escape enables us to obtain a formula for the diffusion coefficient which is valid in the moderate - to - strong friction regime , for small temperatures @xmath36",
    "@xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , small temperature @xmath39 , limit this formula reduces to the small temperature asymptotics of equation  : @xmath40 the calculation of the diffusion coefficient in the underdamped limit requires two calculations , that of the hopping rate and that of the mean squared jump length @xmath41 .",
    "such a calculation was presented in  @xcite for the case of a cosine potential . for this potential , a formula for the diffusion coefficient which is valid in the regime @xmath42",
    "was also obtained by risken and presented in his monograph  @xcite : @xmath43 in contrast to the one dimensional problem , a similar theory in higher dimensions is still lacking , except for the overdamped limit . in this limit",
    "approximate analytical results for certain two - dimensional potentials have been derived in the literature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to prove , using rigorous mathematical analysis , that the diffusion tensor scales like @xmath44 when @xmath45  @xcite .    on the contrary , it is still not clear what the scaling of the ( trace of the ) diffusion tensor with the friction constant is in the underdamped , multidimensional case .",
    "numerical experiments  @xcite suggest that this scaling depends crucially on the detailed properties of the periodic potential ; however , a rigorous and systematic theory for explaining the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the strength of the dissipation in arbitrary dimensions is still lacking .",
    "the situation becomes even more unclear when an external driving force ( either constant or periodic in time ) is present .",
    "brownian motion in tilted periodic potentials has only been studied in one dimension  @xcite and explicit formulas are only valid in the overdamped limit  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical experiments  @xcite seem to indicate that stochastic resonance in periodic potentials in only possible in dimensions higher than one .",
    "in view of the ubiquity of diffusive motion in periodic potentials in applications , it seems to be important to develop the multidimensional theory in a systematic and rigorous way , taking into account external driving forces .",
    "this paper is a contribution towards this goal , and it is a part of our research program on the study of brownian motion in periodic and random potentials  @xcite .",
    "all studies on the problem of brownian motion in a periodic potential that have been reported in the physics literature rely heavily on the analysis of the fokker - planck ( kramers - chandrashekhar ) equation which governs the evolution of the transition probability density for the brownian particle .",
    "for example , the continued fraction expansion method is used in order to solve the fokker - planck equation  @xcite in a semi - analytic fashion and to calculate quantities such as the mobility , the intermediate structure function and the dynamic structure function  @xcite . or , kramers theory is being used , which again relies on the study of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "on the other hand , many tools from stochastic analysis  @xcite , the theory of limit theorems for markov processes  @xcite and the emerging field of multiscale analysis  @xcite are appropriate for the study of this problem and , yet , they have received very little attention in the physics community .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use multiscale methods such as homogenization theory and singular perturbation theory in order to offer a new insight into the problem of brownian motion in periodic potentials . in particular , we derive in a rigorous and systematic way a formula for the diffusion tensor @xmath0 of a brownian particle moving in a periodic potential in arbitrary dimensions and then we use in order to develop an efficient numerical method for calculating @xmath0 .",
    "this numerical method is related to the continued fraction expansion method , but is easier to implement and to analyze . as a byproduct of our analysis ,",
    "we derive rigorously a formula for the diffusion coefficient which is valid in the weak friction limit ; furthermore , we also calculate higher order corrections to the large @xmath4 asymptotics of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : multiscale ] we present the multiscale analysis and we derive a formula for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also show the equivalence between our formula and the green - kubo formula  . in section",
    "we derive formulas which are valid in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 limits . in section  [",
    "sec : numerical ] we develop the numerical method and we compare the numerical results obtained using our method with results obtained from monte carlo simulations , from approximate analytical formulas and from the numerical implementation of formula  .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] is reserved for conclusions .",
    "in this section we use multiscale analysis  @xcite to derive a formula for the diffusion tensor of a brownian particle moving in a periodic potential in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we then show the equivalence between this formula and the green - kubo formula for the diffusion tensor .",
    "we start by rescaling the langevin equation   @xmath48 where we have set @xmath49 .",
    "we will assume that the potential is periodic with period @xmath50 in every direction .",
    "since we expect that at sufficiently long length and time scales the particle performs a purely diffusive motion , we perform a diffusive rescaling to the equations of motion  : @xmath51 , @xmath52 . using the fact that @xmath53 in law we obtain : @xmath54 introducing @xmath55 and @xmath56 we write this equation as a first order system : @xmath57 with the understanding that @xmath58^d$ ] and @xmath59 our goal now is to eliminate the fast variables @xmath60 and to obtain an equation for the slow variable @xmath61 .",

    "we assume that the following ansatz for the solution @xmath84 holds : @xmath85 with @xmath86 being @xmath50 periodic in @xmath87 and satisfying condition  .",
    "we substitute ( [ eq : expansion ] ) into ( [ eq : backw_kolmog_2 ] ) and equate equal powers in @xmath88 to obtain the following sequence of equations :    @xmath89    [ eq : oep ]    from the first equation in ( [ eq : oep ] ) we deduce that @xmath90 , since the null space of @xmath77 consists of functions which are constants in @xmath91 and @xmath87 . now the second equation in ( [ eq : oep ] ) becomes : @xmath92 since @xmath93 , the right hand side of the above equation is mean - zero with respect to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "hence , the above equation is well - posed .",
