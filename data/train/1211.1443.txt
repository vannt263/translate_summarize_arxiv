    "the estimate of this tilt angle comes from the crystal structure ( tilt of the average coordination plane of 4 fluorine first neighbors ; see the inset of fig .",

    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2sm](b ) , @xmath174 tends to decrease when increasing the system size .",
    "a crude estimate of the finite - size effects based on the scaling @xmath182 , leads to @xmath183 .",
    "this gives @xmath184  k ( for @xmath134 ) in excellent agreement with the experimental result of @xmath33  k. furthermore , we can also perform the same finite - size scaling on the positions of the minima in fig .",
    "[ fig2sm](b ) , which leads to @xmath185 . from the experimental value @xmath176  = 27.2  k we thus find @xmath186  = 14.0  t , again in very good agreement with the experimental value of 13.3(5 )  t ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "+ these estimates show that the strong tilting of the cuf@xmath9 octahedra is itself sufficient to _ quantitatively _ account for the observed residual gap .",
    "if any in - plane component of the dm interaction exists , it should provide only a minor effect on the final size of @xmath174 .",
    "note that we can not exclude that the @xmath179 gap has already converged ; the corresponding estimate of @xmath113 value will then provide the upper bound .",
    "assuming that the two effects are additive , as they are in the lowest order , @xmath187 for @xmath179 , we find that @xmath188 , possibly compatible with zero . in a similar way ( using @xmath189 expressions )",
    ", a reasonable estimate for the maximum error of @xmath190 in the determination of the @xmath20 value leads to the same constraint @xmath114 .",
    "+ we therefore conclude that the anticrossing is primarily caused by the @xmath6-tensor tilts , with in - plane dm interaction terms ( @xmath191 ) providing a minor correction to this effect .",
    "the anticrossing appears only if the helicity of the @xmath6-tensor tilts ( here defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1sm ] ) are the same as that defined by the screw axis @xmath103 , that is if @xmath110 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same @xmath6-tensor tilts with @xmath166 would produce a ( previously expected ) level - crossing , and thus a sharp transition at the expected critical field value @xmath192 .",

    "<S> the residual value of the gap @xmath100 appears to be very large , which is a clear evidence for important u(1)-symmetry breaking terms that induce level anticrossing . + in order to describe this anticrossing , we have included the transverse anisotropies in the hamiltonian , which was defined previously by the heisenberg couplings @xmath101 and the @xmath102 component ( @xmath103 ) of the * d * vector  @xcite , and performed exact diagonalizations of this hamiltonian on clusters of @xmath104=  12 and 24 sites @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this enabled us to make a theoretical estimate of the residual gap size and position , and conclude that the experimentally observed gap is well accounted for by the @xmath20 terms alone , with calculated values @xmath111  k and @xmath112  t @xcite , while only minor contribution can come from @xmath113 ( estimated to @xmath114 ) . + in summary , we have described the microscopic properties of rb@xmath1cu@xmath2snf@xmath3 by on - site @xmath0cu nmr . in the field perpendicular to the kagome planes and at low temperature , the nmr spectra evidence a strong staggered transverse spin polarization , growing approximately as a square - root of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependence of the singlet - triplet gap measured via the @xmath97 data presents an anticrossing of the energy levels with a large residual gap value @xmath100 , well accounted for by the staggered @xmath6-tensor terms defined by the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that the observed anticrossing and the absence of phase transition is only compatible with a given sign of @xmath103 . </S>",
