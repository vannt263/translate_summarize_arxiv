    "in 1980 s , witten @xcite asked the following question : can one deform the bundle @xmath24 on a calabi - yau threefold to a stable bundle so that its restriction to any rational curve is nontrivial ? this is list as problem 77 in yau s problem list @xcite .    due to the lack of knowledge about rational curves in calabi - yau threefolds ,",
    "this problem is still open .",
    "however , huybrechts @xcite made some progress for certain calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "now if we consider only the first half of the question : can one deform the direct sum @xmath24 to a slope stable bundle ? then @xcite and @xcite gave satisfactory answers already .",
    "we aim to generalize huybrechts result in the following formulation .",

    "semistable , and by @xcite semistability is an open property , we know that @xmath40 is semistable . if it is strictly semistable , then by @xmath70 and the stability of @xmath71 , we either have a nonzero homomorphism @xmath72 , or a nonzero homomorphism @xmath73 .",

    "we first make some remarks about this proof .",
    "\\(1 ) the proof works for singular ample divisor @xmath25 as well .",
    "indeed , what we need in the proof is to find a nontrivial extension @xmath77 so that @xmath78 .",
    "the role played by @xmath79 is replaced by that of @xmath80 .",
    "\\(2 ) the ampleness of @xmath25 is not essential in the proof .",
    "all we need is @xmath81 which is equivalent to @xmath82 since @xmath0 is a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "this implies that the proof works even for some non - projective ( nonkhler ) case as well .    to compare with huybrechts results , recall that he @xcite gave the following sufficient conditions so that @xmath31 deforms to a stable bundle , in the case where @xmath83 is a calabi - yau manifold embedded as a hypersurface in @xmath84 :    \\(i ) @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the normal bundle of @xmath0 .",
    "\\(ii ) the natural map @xmath87 is nonzero .",
    "one can show that if a calabi - yau threefold satisfies huybrechts conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , then it also satisfies the assumptions in proposition [ log ] , where we take @xmath25 as the zero divisor of a section of @xmath88 whose existence is guaranteed by condition ( ii ) .",
    "we also provide an example ( corollary [ example ] below ) which is not covered by his method . in this sense , proposition [ log ] can be regarded as a generalization of his approach .    before we proceed , we recall huybrechts idea .",
    "he constructed two families of vector bundles @xmath13 and @xmath89 over @xmath0 parametrized by @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 for @xmath39 , and @xmath37 is a nontrivial extension of @xmath71 by @xmath76 , and @xmath92 is a nontrivial extension of @xmath76 by @xmath71 . by the openness of semi - stability , he proved that @xmath40 is stable for generic @xmath93 .",
    "our approach is essential the same .",
    "we have constructed the family @xmath13 in the proof .",
    "now we construct another family @xmath89 so that @xmath92 fits into a nontrivial @xmath94 recall that the map @xmath95 in ( [ map ] ) is injective , the standard sequence @xmath96 defines a nonzero element in @xmath97 , its image under @xmath95 , say @xmath98 , is a nontrivial element in @xmath99 . in conclusion",
    ", we have the following commutative diagram @xmath100 here the middle vertical sequence is the required element @xmath101 in ( [ theta2 ] ) .",
    "note that we have obtained an element @xmath63 in ( [ comm2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we can show that @xmath98 and @xmath63 generate a 2-dimensional subspace @xmath102 .",
    "we define @xmath89 be the family of vector bundles on @xmath0 parametrized by @xmath103 so that the fiber @xmath104 is the bundle obtain by the extension @xmath105 .    it remains to show that @xmath91 for @xmath39 .",
    "note that for @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath108 applying @xmath109 to the short exact sequence given by @xmath57 in the top horizontal sequence above , we get @xmath110 for @xmath111 in ( [ gamma ] ) , let @xmath112 be the subset of elements @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 be the subset of elements @xmath113 with @xmath116 .",
    "notice that @xmath117 are 1-dimensional affine subspaces , and after projectivization , we have @xmath118 .    from diagram ( [ comm3 ] ) , by composing the homomorphisms @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we see that there is a one - to - one affine map @xmath121 which send @xmath63 to @xmath60 .",
    "it further implies that @xmath122 maps to @xmath123 for some @xmath124 .",

    "next we show that @xmath129 is not zero .",
    "it is equivalent to the nonvanishing of @xmath139 .",
    "we can find a bundle @xmath140 which fits into the following diagram @xmath141 then by @xmath142 for @xmath143 , it is equivalent to show that @xmath144 is nonzero .",
    "now we obtain @xmath145 taking cohomology of the bundles , we get @xmath146 a dimension calculation shows that the left vertical map is nonzero",
    ". hence we can apply proposition [ log ] to get the result .",
    "in this section we shall construct stable reflexive sheaves on calabi - yau threefolds with some given chern classes .",

    "it is well - known that for a reflexive sheaf @xmath13 on a smooth variety @xmath0 , the singular locus @xmath152 has codimension at least @xmath30 in @xmath0 ; and every rank @xmath28 reflexive sheaf is invertible .",

    "( a2 ) for every other divisor @xmath264 in the pencil , and a curve @xmath265 which is disjoint from @xmath17 , we can find a surjective homomorphism @xmath266 .    to get a picture of these assumptions , it is helpful to look at the case @xmath250 .",
    "obviously , @xmath267 satisfies these assumptions ( c.f .",
    "proof of proposotion [ ini ] ) , and @xmath268 with @xmath269 ( c.f . remark ( 3 ) after theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "now we construct a rank @xmath12 stable sheaf @xmath259 with @xmath270 $ ] and satisfies the assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",
    "we shall show that @xmath259 satisfies the conditions in proposition [ ind ] as well .",

    "based on ( a2 ) , we can find a curve @xmath265 , linearly equivalent to @xmath236 in @xmath264 , and a surjective homomorphism @xmath266 .",
    "accordingly , from diagram ( [ comm4 ] ) , we can find a surjective homomorphism @xmath273 . for @xmath250 ,",
    "this is given by @xmath274 , which is obvious since the restriction @xmath275 is the direct sum of @xmath276 and torsion part .",
    "it induces a surjective homomorphism @xmath277 .",
    "define @xmath278 evidently , @xmath279 , @xmath280 $ ] , and @xmath259 is not reflexive .",
    "moreover , @xmath259 is stable because @xmath251 is stable .",
    "it is clear that @xmath259 satisfies the induction assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",
    "accordingly , we denote @xmath281 ( resp .",
    "@xmath282 , @xmath283 ) be the kernel of @xmath284 ( resp .",
    "@xmath273 , @xmath285 )",
    ". then we obtain the following @xmath286    now we verify condition ( 1 ) in proposition [ ind ] . notice that we can find ( infinitely many ) divisor @xmath287 , linearly equivalent to @xmath25 , so that there is an exact sequence @xmath288 with @xmath289 . by pushing forward this sequence via the injective homomorphism @xmath290",
    ", we obtain a sheaf @xmath291 fitting into @xmath292 let @xmath293 be the induce homomorphism from the left column .",
    "choose @xmath287 so that the composition of @xmath119 with @xmath294 is nonzero , hence injective .",
    "it implies that by the middle column , we have @xmath295 .",
    "then consider the middle row in ( [ comm5 ] ) , @xmath296 applying @xmath297 , since @xmath25 is ample , @xmath298 by kodaira vanishing theorem .",
    "we obtain a surjective homomorphism @xmath299 notice that the central row in ( [ comm6 ] ) is an element in @xmath300 , by the surjectivity of ( [ surj ] ) , we can find @xmath301 fitting into @xmath302 from the middle column , we get @xmath303 .",
    "hence the middle row in ( [ comm7 ] ) is the required extension which satisfies condition ( 1 ) in proposition [ ind ] .",
    "we denote @xmath304 .    for condition",
    "( 2 ) in proposition [ ind ] , we consider the sequence @xmath305 applying @xmath306 and @xmath307 , we get the following @xmath308 where @xmath309 and @xmath310 are injective maps .    first we claim that every nonreflexive extension in @xmath311 lies in the image of @xmath310 . indeed , for any extension @xmath312 so that @xmath313 is not reflexive . taking double dual ,",
    "we have @xmath314 we want to show that @xmath315 is surjective . if not , let @xmath316 be its image",
    ". then @xmath317 since @xmath313 is not reflexive .",
    "on the other hand , by the inclusion @xmath318 , and @xmath319 , we know that @xmath320 is a quotient of @xmath276",
    ". then we get @xmath321 where @xmath322 is a nonzero sheaf support at points . applying @xmath307",
    ", we get @xmath323 the surjectivity of the first map implies that we can find a sheaf @xmath324 fitting into @xmath325 this is not possible .",

    "therefore @xmath315 is surjective , and every nonreflexive extension in @xmath311 lies in the image of @xmath310 which proves the claim .",
    "next we show that @xmath309 in ( [ comm38 ] ) is not surjective .",
    "using diagram ( [ comm4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath329 and using ( [ comm5 ] ) , we get @xmath330 by the sequence @xmath331 we have @xmath332 by induction , we know that @xmath333 combined with ( [ dim1 ] ) and ( [ dim2 ] ) , we get @xmath334 hence @xmath309 is not surjective .",
    "to verify condition ( 2 ) in proposition [ ind ] , note that @xmath335 does not contained in @xmath336 , it implies that @xmath220 in ( [ comm38 ] ) is injective .",
    "therefore , we can find @xmath337 which is not in the image of @xmath309 . since @xmath220 is injective , @xmath338 is nonzero .",
    "it follows that @xmath339 is nonzero as well .",
    "since @xmath339 does not contained in the image of @xmath310 , we know that it corresponds to a reflexive sheaf .    finally , applying proposition [ ind ] to the nonreflexive sheaf @xmath259 , we obtain a stable reflexive sheaf of rank @xmath258 from the deformation of @xmath340 .",
    "for calabi - yau threefolds of picard number @xmath28 , it is relatively easier to verify directly the stability of a bundle .",
    "however , for general case , there is no standard procedure to check stability .",
    "this is the reason the deformation argument plays a key role .",
    "as we already mentioned , the main theorem of this paper is an application of the technical result theorem [ main ] . for special calabi - yau threefolds ,",
    "e.g. elliptic fibered or branched covering of fano threefolds , one may use theorem [ main ] to construct stable bundles or reflexive sheaves with other given chern classes , as we briefly did in corollary [ k3 ] and the discussion afterwards .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the result with the spectral cover construction for elliptic calabi - yau @xcite , and results obtained by elementary transformation @xcite .    for rank @xmath341 , maeda (",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) showed that one can construct vector bundles of rank @xmath12 using a generalized serre construction .",
