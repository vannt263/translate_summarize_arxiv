    "in a phased array radar , a beam is electronically steered and time for the steering is of the order of microseconds @xcite .",
    "this capability facilitates the use of it as a multifunction radar that alternately performs tasks of various functions such as search , confirm , track , and fire control . since radar resources ( such as time and energy )",
    "are limited , it is necessary to effectively allocate / distributed these resources to multiple functions and tasks to maximize overall mission performance ( see @xcite for various approaches to multifunction radar resource management ) .    one key problem in this resource allocation is search optimization that determines parameters of search beam and pattern to achieve ( or enhance ) search performance while spending minimal ( or fixed ) amount of radar resources .",
    "typical measures for search performance are metrics of target detection performance including one - off / cumulative probability of detection and detection ranges , while a search load , defined by the ratio of radar time allotted for search function , is typically used as a metric of temporal resource consumption .",
    "since minimum - load search allows more temporal resources for higher - priority radar tasks that are usually sensitive to delays , the search optimization is particularly critical to the overall radar mission performance .",
    "the search performance can be influenced by various search beam parameters and the shape of the search beam lattice .",
    "while the choice of lattice types ( i.e. , triangular versus rectangular ) was known not to produce significant difference in performance in terms of overall energy loss @xcite and detection probability @xcite , selection of beam parameters can make a significant impact on the performance of the radar search function .",
    "hence , many previous researches have addressed optimization and/or sensitivity studies on these parameters for single - function search radars @xcite and also for multifunction radars @xcite .",
    "most of the previous work utilized numerical or graphical optimization for various search parameters @xcite .",
    "early work in @xcite investigated optimal frame time of a search radar which maximized detection range for a given cumulative probability of detection .",
    "optimal beam spacing in terms of beam shape / packing loss that can be interpreted as required energy consumption was studied in @xcite",
    ". the same approach to parameter optimization for search function of phased array radar was introduced in @xcite , and false alarm probability , frame time , beam spacing , and duty factor were used as parameters in the design process .",
    "system properties of a radar are adjustable in the design process , thus the objective function of the optimization in @xcite was relative required power , instead of target detection performances , guaranteeing specified track initiation range . in @xcite , track initiation range , 50% detection range , and relative required power with respect to frame time , dwell time , and beam spacing were studied .",
    "however , the approaches described in the previous paragraph can not be directly applied to the context of resource management for multifunction radars . for a multifunction radar , differing from a single dedicated function radar , radar resources",
    "can be preferentially distributed to higher priority functions than the search function , especially in multi - target tracking or fire control during an engagement .",
    "thus , constraints / limitations of radar resources available for the search function should be explicitly taken into account .",
    "recent studies @xcite were devoted to search parameter optimization with consideration of the concept of radar search load . in @xcite , frame time ,",
    "signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and beam overlap angle were optimized to reduce search load while required track initiation range was maintained .",
    "search load that consists of time and power load , both of which are functions of dwell time and frame time , was presented in @xcite , and the parameters were optimized to maximize track initiation range under the constraint of specified search load . in the same way as the researches in the previous paragraph , numerical optimizations were applied to the both literatures @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that availability of analytic solutions for search optimization is very limited . for a missile approach - warning radar system in which full resources are dedicated to the search function , an analytic solution for optimization with a single design variable , dwell time ,",
    "was presented in @xcite . in the process of deriving the analytic solution",
    ", @xcite also confirmed the numerical results in old literature @xcite on the generalization of range interval for averaged single - scan probability detection . to the authors best knowledge ,",
    "no previous work was presented in the open literature on the analytic search optimization of multifunction radars with also accounting for the notion of radar load .    in this paper , a semi - analytic optimization procedure of surveillance beam parameters of multifunction phased array radars",
    "is presented for minimization of search load while keeping desired one - off and cumulative probabilities of detection .",
    "beam width , dwell time , beam spacing ratio , and frame time are included in the beam parameters .",
    "the major finding of this work is that the optimization problem can be decomposed into a set of three subproblems , thus the procedure is threefold :    1 .",
    "analytical optimization of beam width , dwell time , and beam spacing ratio with a certain level of snr ; 2 .",
    "root - finding with respect to frame time with a certain level of snr ; 3 .",
    "one - dimensional numerical optimization of search load along snr using optimal beam parameters attained in the previous steps .",
    "since analytic expressions of three beam parameters are available from the first step , the nonlinear constrained optimization with respect to four variables is reduced to a line search problem of a single variable , i.e. , snr , including iterations of one - dimensional root - finding .",
    "equivalence of this subproblem - decomposition - based approach to the original nonlinear optimization is shown in the process ; numerical results verify the efficacy of the proposed method .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented in @xcite , but it addressed only one of the subproblems in this paper .",
    "this paper exclusively includes : ( a ) optimization procedure including an additional parameter ( i.e. frame time ) and a constraint ( i.e. cumulative probabilities of detection ) , ( b ) more theoretical analysis on analytic optimization of the first subproblem , and ( c ) additional numerical results and a sensitivity study on radar power .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 formulates the search optimization problem by defining the design variables of search parameters , constraints on detection performance , and the cost function of radar load ; in section 3 , the decomposition of the optimization problem and respective solutions of the subproblems are presented ; section 4 demonstrates the optimization procedure with numerical results and discusses some findings ; the paper is concluded in section 5 .",
    "consider search beam patterns of triangular and rectangular lattices ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the design variables for the optimization are search beam parameters that decide the pattern and execution of the beams :    * _ beam width _ ( @xmath0 ) : the effective width of the radar beam . *",
    "_ beam spacing ratio _ ( @xmath1 ) : angular distance between adjacent beams normalized by the beam width . *",
    "_ dwell time _ ( @xmath2 ) : execution time of a search task for a single beam position . * _ frame time _ ( @xmath3 ) : period of a search frame , which is a group of beams forming a lattice in an assigned search area .",
    "dimensionless variables associated with the above design variables can also be defined for convenience of analysis : @xmath4 where variables with subscript @xmath5 denote some reference values .",
    "the beam spacing ratio @xmath1 is by definition dimensionless .",
    "note that a multifunction radar can not devote the entire temporal resource to surveillance .",
    "thus , it is important to achieve a certain level of search performance with minimum temporal resource consumption .",
    "the search load is a measure of expected temporal resource consumption by search function :    * _ search load _ ( @xmath6 ) : the proportion of radar time occupied by the execution of search beams in the long - term .",
    "thus , if all the search beams have the same dwell time , the search load is the product of the number of beams @xmath7 and the ratio of dwell time @xmath2 to frame time @xmath3 : @xmath8 let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote effective lengths of search area in azimuth and elevation of the radar , respectively ; the effective length is the length in a plane of radar s direction cosines usually called @xmath11-space , but originally @xmath12-plane @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is defined as the dimension of the search lattice , i.e. , @xmath14 for a one - dimensional and @xmath15 for a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "for the one dimensional lattice @xmath14 , one of the effective lengths in azimuth and elevation directions is eliminated or replaced with a non - dimensional property , such as the number of scanning bars .",
    "then , the number of search beams in the frame required to cover the search area is approximately @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the search load @xmath6 can be expressed in terms of the design variables as : @xmath17 this search load can also be expressed in terms of dimensionless design variables : @xmath18 with an appropriately defined coefficient @xmath19 ; detailed expression of this coefficient is given in ( [ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "the constraints of the search load optimization are requirements of target detection performance ; one - off probability of detection @xmath20 at some reference range @xmath21 and cumulative probability of detection @xmath22 at the same reference range are adopted in this work .",
    "the requirements of performance indicate that one - off and cumulative probabilities of detection under some search load have to be larger than or at least equal to respective desired level of probabilities , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that can be written as : @xmath25 the details and expressions of the probabilities of detection are explained in [ sec : pd ] and [ sec : pc ] , respectively .",
    "it is known that probability of detection is a function of snr dependent on the above design variables .",
    "the snr @xmath26 of a target that deviates from the beam boresight by an amount of @xmath27 is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the snr with reference values of range @xmath21 , beam width @xmath30 , dwell time of the beam @xmath31 , and zero target deviation @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 in the exponent is dependent on beam shape loss ; its value is 1 if the radar performs element - level digital beamforming and 2 otherwise .",
    "the impact of beam width on snr is parameterized by a degree @xmath34 of beam width ratio .",
    "@xmath34 is approximately 4 including transmission and reception gains where each gain is a function of a reciprocal of squared beam width @xcite .    for setting the search performance requirements , the worst - case in a lattice",
    "is considered . with the search lattices in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the weakest point where snr is the lowest is the point farthest from the centers of beams , i.e. , the centroid of the triangle ( or the square ) with vertices of adjacent beam centers .",
    "the angular distance from a center of a neighboring beam to this centroid can be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 for a triangular lattice , and @xmath37 for a rectangular one .    for given beam parameters , the lowest snr at the reference range @xmath21 where the target deviates from the boresight by @xmath38",

    "@xmath54 can be calculated by the inverse function of ( [ eq : pd ] ) : @xmath56      the cumulative detection probability is also used as a measure of search performance . as described in @xcite , this quantity represents the probability that an approaching target is detected at least once by the time it arrives down at some given range @xmath57 ; in this paper , the expression considered in @xcite is used to define this quantity . assuming scan - to - scan independence ,",

    "this work explicitly takes advantage of this functional structure to find out the solution to the above optimization .",

    "this work particularly considers the nonzero lower limits of the design variables while the upper limits can be very large . as",

    "one way to solve the search beam optimization given in section [ sec : formulation ] is to simply implement some general optimization algorithm ( such as gradient - based methods , genetic algorithms , and etc . ) to the formulation and obtain the optimized values of the design variables .",
    "such a way should work to provide an ( local ) optimal solution to the formulation , but it may incur significant computational load and also it is sometimes hard to interpret the physical meaning of the solutions obtained fully relying on numerical optimization tools . therefore , this paper tries to take advantage of the underlying functional properties of the optimization problem in order to decompose it into a series of simpler subproblems with some analytical approach as far as possible .",

    "thus , level curves for the given @xmath6 and @xmath41 can be drawn in the @xmath87 plane : @xmath88 @xmath89 consider two level curves of ( [ eq : lc_ls ] ) for different values of @xmath6 , @xmath90 , and a level curve of ( [ eq : lc_rs ] ) for @xmath83 . since @xmath91 from the definition of @xmath6 and snr model in section [ sec : prob_des ] , the level curve for @xmath41 grows rapidly than the @xmath6 level curves ; and the intersection point of any two level curves for @xmath41 and @xmath6 is the feasible @xmath92 pair for the given @xmath41 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , and @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "now consider level curves for two different @xmath41s , @xmath95 , and corresponding optimal @xmath6 level curves and @xmath96 pairs ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since optimal @xmath96 pairs are located only on the lower bounds and the @xmath97 level curve lies always below the @xmath98 level curve , @xmath99 thus , as the desired level of @xmath41 increases , @xmath100 decreases monotonically and @xmath101 increases monotonically .",

    "the optimal pair moves vertically upward along @xmath107 after @xmath108 with a further increase of @xmath41 .",

    ", it will be shown that beam spacing ratio @xmath1 remains a constant value . since there is a discrepancy between the largest @xmath41 in the first phase and the smallest @xmath41 in the last phase , beam spacing ratio @xmath1 decreases to sustain growing @xmath41 level between the two phases , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 are fixed at their minimum bounds @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , for varying level of @xmath41 , there are three phases in optimal selection of @xmath77 :      when @xmath41 is small enough , @xmath101 is fixed at @xmath94 and the other two design variables can be determined analytically . for given @xmath41 and @xmath111 ,",
