    "gas settles into a filamentary pattern , streams into galaxies , and is peacefully converted into stars .",
    "the right panel is similar , except the energy released by each galaxy s supernovae and central black hole creates an enormous blastwave that sends metal - enriched gas back into its surroundings .",
    "distinguishing between these possibilities is important , because standard models of galaxy formation can not reproduce many basic observations unless something heats and disrupts the gas near galaxies ( although see ari maller s contribution for an alternate solution ) .",
    "establishing or ruling out the existence of `` superwinds '' would have far - reaching implications .    ]",
    "one approach , taken by rauch ( this volume ) and others , is to look for statistical differences between the observed intergalactic absorption in qso spectra and the predictions of a windless scenario .",
    "a simple calculation shows the difficulty of this approach .",
    "suppose every lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) at redshift @xmath2 were surrounded by a spherical wind with a time - averaged radius of @xmath3 comoving mpc .",
    "this is the maximum radius allowed by even the most optimistic assumptions about the available energy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger 2002 ) ) . then the volume filling - fraction of winds would be only 1.7% for the observed lbg comoving number density of @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "galaxies too faint to be selected as lbgs would presumably increase the filling fraction somewhat , but still the impact of the tiny disturbed regions on the overall statistics of the igm would be small and difficult to discern .",
    "this is especially true since absorption lines in the disturbed and undisturbed regions trace the same large - scale structure and are both produced by gas that has settled to similar temperatures of a few @xmath6 k near the bottleneck in the cooling curve ; their powerspectra will therefore have nearly indistinguishable shapes in the large @xmath7 and small @xmath7 limits .",
    "we adopted an alternate approach .",
    "since a weak signal is easier to detect if one knows where to look , we decided to measure the redshifts of galaxies near qso sightlines and focus our attention on the @xmath8% of the igm that lay within 1 mpc of an lbg .",
    "our sample currently consists of spectroscopic redshifts for more than 1000 galaxies with @xmath9 that lie in fields containing 25 qsos .",
    "over 500 civ systems were detectable in our qso spectra .    a detailed analysis of the survey can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger  ( 2005c ) ) . here is a brief summary of their main empirical results .",
    "the interpretation will be discussed afterwards .",
    "@xmath10 the gas that lies within 40kpc of lbgs produces extremely strong absorption lines ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) in the spectra of background galaxies and qsos .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the civ absorption in low - resolution spectra imply that the absorbing material has range of velocities of at least @xmath13 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the absorption produced by this gas is similar to the interstellar absorption seen in lbgs spectra , suggesting the lbgs outflowing `` interstellar '' gas may actually lie at radii approaching 40kpc .",
    "@xmath10 for roughly half of the lbgs , civ absorption lines with equivalent width @xmath15 @xmath12 are observed out to impact parameters of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "this implies that roughly one - third of all `` intergalactic '' absorption lines with @xmath17 @xmath12 are produced by gas that lies within @xmath16 kpc of an lbg .",
    "galaxies too faint to satisfy our selection criteria could easily account for the remainder . in some cases",
    "the absorbing gas has substructure on half - kpc scales .",
    "@xmath10 the cross - correlation function of galaxies and civ systems with @xmath18 @xmath12 appears to be the same as the correlation function of galaxies .",
    "this implies that civ systems and galaxies reside in similar parts of the universe and is consistent with the idea that they are largely the same objects .",
    "we also find a strong association of ovi systems with galaxies ( upper left panel , figure  [ fig : q1700civxigc ] ) . on small scales",
    "the redshift - space cross - correlation function is highly anisotropic ( right panel , figure  [ fig : q1700civxigc ] ) .",
    "the metal - enriched gas must therefore have large velocities relative to nearby galaxies .",
    "the required velocities appear to exceed the galaxies velocity dispersions but are similar to the galaxies observed outflow speeds .     band .",
    "vertical lines mark the redshifts of ovi and civ absorption .",
    "thicker lines in the civ panel mark systems with multiple components .",
    "ovi absorption redshifts are taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simcoe , sargent , & rauch ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "the absorption line catalogs are reasonably complete down to their limiting equivalent widths , but , owing to imperfect color - selection criteria and limited time for follow - up spectroscopy , it is unlikely that the galaxy catalogs contain more than half of the galaxies brighter than @xmath19 at these redshifts .",
    "right panel : the spatial separations of our sample s galaxy - civ pairs in the angular ( @xmath20 ) and redshift ( @xmath21 ) directions . vertical lines show the projected distance between each galaxy in the nirspec sample and its nearest qso . the qso spectra allow us to detect any civ - absorbing gas along these lines .",
    "circles show the actual locations of detected civ absorption .",
    "owing to the power - law shape of the galaxy - civ correlation function , half of the circles ( on average ) would lie inside the dotted triangular envelope if there were no peculiar velocities .",
    "in fact 65 of 81 lie outside .",
    "the uncertainty in each galaxy - civ pair s redshift separation ( i.e. , in each circle s vertical position ) is too small to account for this ( @xmath22 km s@xmath14 or @xmath23 comoving mpc ) .",
    "peculiar velocities must therefore be substantial .",
    "if the civ systems were orbiting in the galaxy s halo , their observed redshift separations would be displaced relative to their true separations by a random amount comparable to their galaxy s velocity dispersion @xmath24 ( @xmath25 km s@xmath14 or @xmath26 comoving mpc ) .",
    "if the civ were infalling , one would expect the civ systems observed ( i.e. , redshift space ) positions to be artificially compressed towards the @xmath27 axis by an amount comparable to @xmath24 .",
    "if it were flowing outwards , the observed positions would be displaced away from the @xmath27 axis by an amount that depends on the wind speed .",

    "* adelberger et al . ( 2003 ) ) , we find that the gas within @xmath3 comoving mpc of lbgs usually produces strong ly-@xmath30 absorption in the spectra of background galaxies .",
    "the absorption is weak ( mean transmitted flux within @xmath3 mpc of @xmath31 ) in only about one case out of three .",
    "even so , the weakness of the absorption in these cases remains difficult to understand .",
    "since high - redshift galaxies reside in dense parts of the universe , with large amounts of hydrogen and short recombination times , one would expect them to be surrounded by large amount of hi  unless something had disrupted the nearby material .",
    "one might imagine that the hi has collapsed into clouds and that the sightlines to the background qsos occasionally miss every cloud near a galaxy , but the sph simulations of kollmeier et al .",
    "( in preparation ) suggest that the chance of this is very low .",
    "galaxies would presumably be associated with qso absorption lines even if there were no winds .",
    "i thought it might be useful to spend some time discussing how strongly ( or weakly ) the different observations support the superwind scenario .",
    "table  [ tab : reportcard ] presents my views in the form of a report card .",
    "each observation is graded on two criteria : ( a ) how certain we are , statistically , that the observation is correct , and ( b ) how cleanly the observation would support the wind scenario if it were correct .",
    "i am adopting the harvard grading system , in which ` a ' is the highest grade you can get and everyone gets it unless they are completely abject .",
    "although it was not the subject of my talk , i ll begin with the blueshifted absorption and redshifted lyman-@xmath30 emission that has been detected in hundreds of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shapley et al . 2003 ) ; erb et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "this is expected in a wide range of models in which the stars are surrounded by outflowing gas ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tenorio - tagle et al . 1999 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zheng & miralda - escude 2002 ) ) and ( as far as i know ) is not expected in any other class of realistic models . since it also can not be a statistical fluctuation , i give it an a in both columns .",
    "there is a significant caveat , however : it tells us only that outflowing gas lies somewhere outside the stellar radius , not that the outflow will spill out of the galaxy s halo and qualify as a superwind .",
    "the strength of civ absorption at @xmath32 kpc may suggest that the outflows have normally advanced to this radius , but even so this is only about half way to the virial radius .",
    "the minimum allowed velocity range of the gas at @xmath32 kpc ( @xmath33 km s@xmath14 ) is not large enough to guarantee escape . in any case",
    "the similarity of the civ absorption strength in lbgs spectra and at impact parameter @xmath32 kpc could just be a coincidence ; it does not rule out the idea that the gas at 40kpc is falling into or orbiting within the galaxy s potential .",
    "anisotropies in the galaxy / civ - system correlation function disfavor infall and seem to favor rapid outflows for the origin of the civ , but the small number of distinct galaxy - civ pairs leaves the situation unclear .",
    "all of these results are based on only a handful of galaxies and their statistical significance merits only a c+ . in larger sample",
    "they could prove to be powerful diagnostics , however , especially the correlation - function anisotropies and the changes in civ mean velocity and velocity width as a function of impact parameter .",
    "that is the justification for the b+ in the interpretation column .",
    "measuring the spatial correlation of galaxies and metals on large ( mpc ) scales provides a powerful way to distinguish between different scenarios for intergalactic metal enrichment .",
    "if the metals were produced in lbgs , they should have a spatial bias similar to the galaxies bias of @xmath34 at @xmath35 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( adelberger et al . 2005 ) )",
    ". they would have @xmath36 if they were produced at any redshift by the numerous dwarf galaxies that are @xmath37 fluctuations , and @xmath38 at @xmath35 if ( as envisioned by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ) ) they were produced at @xmath39 by galaxies that were @xmath40 fluctuations .",
    "these estimates of the bias exploit ( * ? ? ? * mo & white s ( 1996 ) ) high - redshift ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) approximation @xmath42^{-1}$ ] for the bias at redshift @xmath43 of objects that were @xmath44-sigma fluctuations at the earlier redshift @xmath45",
    ". the galaxy - metal cross - correlation length would therefore be equal to the galaxy - galaxy correlation length if the metals were produced by lbgs and smaller for the other two cases .",
    "unfortunately we have measured the galaxy - civ correlation length , not the galaxy - metal correlation length .",
    "understanding the relationship between the two will likely require sophisticated numerical simulations that may not be available for many years .",
    "since our galaxy - civ clustering measurements will not sway the skeptical until that time , i have assigned them a c for their interpretive value .",
    "they merit no more than a b for significance since our @xmath40 confidence intervals would allow galaxy - civ clustering to be considerably weaker than the galaxy - galaxy clustering .",
    ".report card [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     although there are now 9 galaxies in our sample with precise ( near - ir nebular line ) redshifts and little hi within @xmath3 comoving mpc , their statistical significance is worth only a c+ in my opinion .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the measurement is difficult . to determine whether a galaxy lies within @xmath46 mpc of a narrow absorption line in a qso spectrum",
    ", one needs a good understanding of many possible sources of random and systematic error in the estimated redshifts . in about half the cases",
    "there is no absorption line anywhere near the galaxy redshift , but in the remainder the galaxies could conceivably be associated with nearby absorption lines if redshift errors were somewhat larger than we estimate . reducing the number of galaxies with little nearby hi by 50% would begin to make our observations consistent with the predictions of windless sph simulations .",
    "second , 5 of the 9 galaxies lie within a single field , q1623 , which contains one of the largest known concentrations of qsos with @xmath47 . this is a consequence of the dense spectroscopic sampling we obtained in the field , but it raises the possibility that our result might have been different had we surveyed a more representative part of the universe",
    ". the spatial clustering strength of the high - redshift galaxies in this field is certainly not typical , for example ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger et al . 2005b ) ) .",
    "interpreting the result is difficult because of the complexity of the any interaction between winds and galaxies inhomogeneous surroundings .",
    "this can not be modeled analytically , and existing numerical simulations are unable to resolve either the shock fronts or the instabilities that result when the hot wind flows past cooler intergalactic material . as a result",
    "it is difficult to know whether winds would destroy the hi near galaxies .",
    "other effects that simulations do not resolve ( e.g. , cooling instabilities ) might reduce the covering fraction of hi near galaxies .",
    "even if there were low - density regions near galaxies in sph simulations , they might not be recognized since the density is generally estimated by smoothing over the few dozen nearest particles , particles which ( by definition ) are likely to lie outside of any local underdensity .",
    "it therefore remains uncertain whether the lack of hi near some galaxies is necessary or sufficient to establish the existence of superwinds .",
    "the lack of any correlation between galaxy properties and the strength of nearby intergalactic hi absorption ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger et al .",
    "2005c ) ) makes me suspect that the weak observed hi absorption is probably unrelated to winds .",
    "i have given this observation a `` c+ '' for interpretative value , but that is generous .",
    "it is easy to measure the relative spatial positions of galaxies and the gas that produces qso absorption lines , but difficult to find conclusive evidence for superwinds around galaxies .",
    "this is partly because our sample is still small , but mostly , i think , because theorists have been unable to work out the observational consequences of superwinds .",
    "it is entirely possible , for example , that our measured galaxy - civ correlation function rules out every explanation except superwinds , but we would not know since the necessary simulations do not exist .    although i have emphasized the weaknesses in the superwind interpretation , i should point out that in my opinion the weaknesses in the alternate scenario are far worse .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : metals ] illustrates the major problem faced by those who believe that intergalactic metals were created in early episodes of star formation at @xmath48 : they must assume that the metals produced at @xmath1 escape from their galaxies with ease while almost none of the metals produced at @xmath2 are able to do so . in order for 90% of the intergalactic metals observed at @xmath2 to have been produced at @xmath1 , for example",
    ", supernovae ejecta would have to be at least 100 times more likely to escape their galaxy at @xmath49 than at @xmath35 .",
    "( see the caption to figure  [ fig : metals ] for the derivation of this number . )",
    "it is widely believed that high - redshift supernovae ejecta escape more easily because galaxy masses are lower at high redshift , and that they pollute the igm more readily because they need to reach only a comparatively small physical radius to enrich a large comoving volume .",
    "* scannapieco ( 2005 ) ) argues that these two effects cause the comoving filling fraction of the ejecta @xmath50 ( or , more formally , the porosity ) to depend on mass and redshift as @xmath51 .",
    "( similar equations have been derived by madau et al .",
    "2001 and dozens of other papers . )",
    "this equation predicts that metals from @xmath52 galaxies at @xmath49 should have a filling fraction @xmath53 times larger than those from the @xmath54 galaxies observed at @xmath2 .",
    "it is not clear to me whether this is enough to explain the left panel of figure  [ fig : metals ] , but the question is moot : in my view , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* scannapieco s ( 2005 ) ) formula vastly overstates the actual advantage of very high - redshift galaxies .",
    "( lbg ) compared to the amount of metals in the igm at @xmath55 and to the amount of metals produced at @xmath56 .",
    "the amount of metals produced by massive galaxies at @xmath55 was calculated by assuming that each @xmath57 of star formation produced @xmath58 of metals and scaling from the @xmath55 stellar - mass density measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dickinson et al . ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "an upper limit to the amount of metals produced at @xmath56 was derived by assuming a constant comoving star - formation density at all redshifts @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that @xmath60% of the stars that exist at @xmath61 were formed at @xmath56 .",
    "it is an upper limit because the actual star - formation density at @xmath62 appears to be significantly lower than the star - formation density at @xmath55 .",
    "the amount of metals in the igm was calculated by multiplying the critical density by the estimated intergalactic metal density at @xmath55 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schaye et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "if 90% of the intergalactic metals at @xmath55 were produced at @xmath56 , the fraction of metals that escape into the igm would have to be @xmath65 times higher at @xmath56 than at @xmath6623 . _",
    "right panels : _ distance to the nearest massive ( @xmath67 ) halo at @xmath55 for all gif - lcdm simulation particles whose distance @xmath68 to the nearest halo satisfied @xmath69 at @xmath49 ( top ) or @xmath70 ( bottom ) . dashed lines show the particles original ( higher redshift ) distribution of @xmath71 ; the solid shaded histograms show the distribution at @xmath55 .",
    "these particles initially lie at larger radii than those expected for the metals ejected by very high redshift winds , yet they mostly end up inside halos by @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the metals ejected at @xmath72 and @xmath1 will generally also lie in massive halos at @xmath55 , not in the igm .",
    "[ fig : metals],height=288 ]    there are two reasons .",
    "first , it assumes that small galaxies at high redshift convert their baryons into stars exactly as efficiently as more massive galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is probably wrong by an order of magnitude .",
    "star - formation efficiencies in massive galaxies at @xmath2 appear to be far higher , as is easily seen by comparing the ratio of stellar to baryonic mass in lbgs ( @xmath73 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger et al . 2004 ) ) to the global average at @xmath35 , @xmath74 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dickinson et al . 2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rudnick et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "since every baryon at @xmath35 was part of a low - mass halo at higher redshift , at least in the press - schechter picture , and only @xmath75% of them had been turned into stars by @xmath35 , the mean star - formation efficiency in low mass halos at high redshift is evidently @xmath60 times lower than the mean efficiency in lbgs .",
    "a more realistic comparison would omit the halos with masses @xmath76 that are too small to host star formation and would note that @xmath77 is an order of magnitude lower at @xmath1 than @xmath55 for realistic cosmic star - formation histories .",
    "this leads to a similar conclusion .",
    "the high efficiency of star - formation in massive galaxies at @xmath55 removes the low - mass halos supposed advantage in enriching the igm .",
    "second , only a fraction of the metals released into the igm at @xmath1 will remain in the igm at @xmath6623 .",
    "this is a simple consequence of hierarchical structure formation : the material that lies near galaxies at higher redshift ( e.g. , any metal - enriched ejecta ) will lie @xmath78 galaxies at lower redshift .",
    "because they neglect this , standard treatments seriously overestimate the intergalactic volume that metals produced at @xmath1 will occupy at @xmath55 .",
    "to illustrate the point , i calculated the distance to the nearest halo of mass @xmath79 at @xmath80 for every particle in the gif - lcdm simulation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kauffmann et al . 1999 ) ) that lay within @xmath3 comoving mpc of a galaxy ( i.e. , halo ) at @xmath49 or @xmath70 .",
    "the result , shown in the right hand panels of figure  [ fig : metals ] , is stark : the overwhelming majority of these particles end up inside the virial radius of a galaxy at @xmath55 . since the stalled ejecta of galaxies at @xmath49 or @xmath70",
    "will be swept along by the movements of the material that surrounds the galaxies , it should largely end up inside galaxies at @xmath55 as well . this exercise may be slightly misleading , since the gif - lcdm simulation only resolves halos of mass @xmath67 , not the smaller halos believed to be most responsible for polluting the igm at @xmath1 .",
    "however , a simple calculation shows that a significant fraction of the metals from the lower - mass progenitors should also end up inside galaxies at @xmath55 .",
    "the estimated stalling radius for winds from small galaxies at @xmath1 is @xmath65 comoving kpc ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* madau et al . 2001 ) ) , which is the lagrangian radius for a halo of mass @xmath81 .",
    "if these galaxies typical descendants at @xmath55 have masses significantly larger than this , the metals will likely have been swept inside them . according to the extended press - schechter formalism",
    ", @xmath82% of the galaxies at @xmath61 that descended from @xmath40 fluctuations at @xmath49 will have masses that exceed this threshold by an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , equation 2.16 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lacey & cole ( 1993 ) ) ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the metals produced at @xmath48 should therefore be locked inside galaxies by @xmath55 . once there , some of the metals are likely to cool further , fall towards the center , and disappear from view . since the total metal production at @xmath48 is at best comparable to the observed metal content of the igm at @xmath662 ( left panel , figure  [ fig : metals ] ) , this suggests that the intergalactic metallicity at @xmath55 must receive a significant contribution from some other source .",
    "a corollary is that the metal content of the igm would drain into galaxies and _ decrease _ over time if it were not continually replenished .",
    "the observed constancy of the igm metallicity ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schaye et al . 2003 ) ) therefore also seems to require metals to escape from galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "in addition , a host of indirect arguments point towards superwinds from relatively massive galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "clustering measurements show that galaxies that were forming star rapidly at @xmath2 are no longer forming stars by @xmath83 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adelberger et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "what physical process is responsible for this , if not energetic feedback that strips away the galaxies gas and slows subsequent accretion ?",
    "if winds are only able to escape from dwarf galaxies , how come so large a fraction of metals in the local universe are found in the intracluster medium , near the largest galaxies ?",
    "i could carry on but my allotted time is up .",
    "although we have not yet found unequivocal evidence that intergalactic metals at @xmath66 23 are often produced by galaxies at similar redshifts , the burden of proof surely falls on the other camp .",
