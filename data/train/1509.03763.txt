    "in 1935 , erwin schrdinger @xcite proposed a famous thought experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of both alive and dead states .",
    "he imagined that a cat , a small radioactive source , a geiger counter , a hammer and a small bottle of poison were sealed in a chamber .",
    "if one atom of the radioactive source decays , the counter will trigger a device to release the poison .",
    "so the state of the cat will be entangled with the state of the radioactive source .",
    "after a certain time , the cat will be in superposition of both alive and dead states .",
    "the possibility of an organism to be in a superposition state is counter - intuitive and dramatically reveals the profound consequences of quantum mechanics . besides their importance in studying foundations of quantum mechanics , quantum superposition and entangled states are key resources for quantum metrology and quantum information @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the explanation of how a `` schrdinger s cat '' state collapses is the touchstone of different interpretations of quantum mechanics .",
    "while many - worlds interpretations propose that there is no wave function collapse @xcite , objective collapse theories @xcite propose that the wave function collapse is an intrinsic event that happens spontaneously .",
    "the `` schrdinger s cat '' thought experiment has attracted enormous interest since it was proposed eighty years ago @xcite .",
    "many great efforts have been made to create large quantum superposition states .",
    "superposition states of photons , electrons , atoms , and some molecules have been realized @xcite .",
    "wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems has been observed @xcite .",
    "recent developments in quantum optomechanics @xcite and electromechanics @xcite provide new opportunities to create even larger superposition states experimentally @xcite . in 2009 , romero - isart et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to optically trap a living microorganism in a high - finesse optical cavity in vacuum to create a superposition state . that paper increased our hope to experimentally study the quantum nature of living organisms @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , li et al . demonstrated optical trapping of a pure silica microsphere in air and vacuum @xcite , and cooled its center - of - mass motion from room temperature to about 1.5 mk in high vacuum @xcite .",
    "recently , parametric feedback cooling @xcite and cavity cooling of pure dielectric nanoparticles @xcite were also demonstrated .",
    "these are important steps towards quantum ground state cooling of a levitated dielectric particle .",
    "optical trapping of an organism in vacuum , however , has not been realized experimentally .",
    "the main difficulty is that the optical absorption coefficient @xcite of organisms is much larger than that of a pure silica particle , which can lead to significant heating of an optically trapped microorganism in vacuum .",
    "recently , fisher proposed that the nuclear spin of phosphorus can serve as the putative quantum memory in brains @xcite .    here",
    "we propose to create quantum superposition and entangled states of a living microorganism by putting a small bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator , such as a membrane embedded in a superconducting microwave resonant circuit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "our proposal also works for viruses .",
    "since many biologists do not consider viruses as living organisms @xcite , we focus on small bacteria in this paper .",
    "our proposal has several advantages .",
    "first , it avoids the laser heating problem as no laser is required in our scheme .",
    "second , quantum ground state cooling and advanced state control of an electromechanical oscillator integrated in a superconducting circuit have been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation based on superconducting circuits has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "in addition , most microorganisms can survive in the cryogenic environment that is required to achieve ground state cooling of an electromechanical oscillator . although microorganisms are frozen in a cryogenic environment , they can be still living and become active after thawing @xcite .",
    "cryopreservation is a mature technology that has been used clinically worldwide @xcite .",
    "most microorganisms can be preserved for many years in cryogenic environments @xcite .",
    "even some organs @xcite can be preserved at cryogenic temperatures . at millikelvin temperatures , a microorganism can be exposed to ultrahigh vacuum without sublimation of water ice .",
    "more importantly , the internal states of a microorganism , such as the electron spin of a glycine radical @xmath1 @xcite , can also be prepared in superposition states and entangled with its center - of - mass motion in the cryogenic environment .",
    "this will be remarkably similar to schrdinger s initial thought experiment of entangling the state of an entire organism (  alive \" or  dead \" state of a cat ) with the state of a microscopic particle ( a radioactive atom ) .",
    "we also propose to teleport the center - of - mass motion state and internal electron spin state between two remote microorganisms , which is beyond schrdinger s thought experiment .",
    "since internal states of an organism contain information , our proposal provides an experimental scheme for teleporting information or memories between two organisms .",
    "our proposed setup not only can be used to study macroscopic quantum mechanics , but also has applications in quantum - limited magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) for sensitive magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of biological samples @xcite .",
    "this will provide more than structural information that can be obtained by cryo - electron microscopy @xcite , which also requires the sample to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to avoid sublimation of water ice in vacuum .",
    "this system can coherently manipulate and detect the quantum states of electron spins , which enables single electron spins that could not be read with optical or electrical methods to be used as quantum memory .     on top of an electromechanical membrane oscillator with a mass of @xmath2 .",
    "the membrane is the upper plate of a capacitor embedded in a superconductor inductor - capacitor ( lc ) resonator .",
    "the lc resonator is coupled to a transmission line .",
    "the membrane has an intrinsic mechanical oscillation frequency of @xmath3 and a linewidth of @xmath4 when the microorganism is not on it .",
    "the lc resonator has a resonant frequency of @xmath5 and an energy decay rate of @xmath6 .",
    "some microorganisms have smooth surfaces ( * b * ) while some have pili on their surfaces ( * c * ) , width=321 ]",
    "recently , a 15-@xmath0m - diameter aluminum membrane with a thickness of 100 nm has been cooled to quantum ground state by sideband cooling with a superconducting inductor - capacitor ( lc ) resonator @xcite .",
    "coherent state transfer between the membrane and a traveling microwave field @xcite , as well as entangling the motion of the membrane and a microwave field @xcite have been realized .",
    "the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in a cryostat at 15 mk .",
    "the mechanical oscillation frequency of this membrane is about 10 mhz , with a mechanical quality factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the mass of the membrane is 48 pg ( @xmath8 da ) .",
    "as shown in table [ table1 ] , this mass is about four orders larger than the mass of ultra - small bacteria and even more orders larger than the mass of viruses @xcite .",
    "we can use this membrane oscillator to create quantum superposition states of a small microorganism . among different cells ,",
    "mycoplasma bacteria are particularly suitable for performing this experiment because they are ubiquitous and their sizes are small @xcite . in addition , they have been preserved at cryogenic temperatures @xcite .",
    "it will also be interesting to create superposition states of prochlorococcus .",
    "prochlorococcus is presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on the earth , with an abundance of about @xmath9 cells / ml in surface seawater @xcite .",
    "it can be used to study quantum processes in photosynthesis .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]a , we consider a bacterium or virus on top of an electromechanical membrane oscillator .",
    "we assume the mass of the microorganism @xmath10 is much smaller than the mass of the membrane @xmath2 .",
    "some microorganisms have smooth surfaces ( fig .",

    "for simplicity , it will be better to use microorganisms with smooth surfaces .",
    "one way to put a microorganism on top of an electromechanical membrane is to spray a small amount of microorganisms to air in a sealed glove box , and wait one microorganism to settle down on the electromechanical membrane .",
    "the process can be monitored with an optical microscope .",
    "after being cooled down to a cryogenic temperature , the microorganism can be exposed to high vacuum without sublimation of the water ice .",
    "techniques developed in cryo - electron microscopy can be utilized here @xcite .",
    "the sublimation rate of water ice is only about 0.3 monolayers / h at 128 k with a sublimation energy of 0.45 ev @xcite .",
    "the sublimation of water ice can be safely ignored at millikelvin temperatures .    at millikelvin temperatures",
    ", a frozen microorganism will be in a hard and brittle state like a glass .",
    "it will be stuck on the membrane due to van der waals force or even stronger chemical bonds . the pull - off force between a 1 @xmath0 m sphere and a flat surface due to",
    "van der waals force is on the order 100  nn @xcite , which is about @xmath11 times larger than the gravitational force on a 1 @xmath0 m particle .",
    "so the microorganism will move together with the membrane as long as there is a good contact between them .",
    "the oscillation frequency of the membrane oscillator will change by roughly @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is the intrinsic oscillation frequency of the membrane .",
    "the exact frequency shift depends on the position of the microorganism on the membrane .",
    "nonetheless , this frequency shift will be small and will not significantly affect the ground state cooling or other state control of the membrane when @xmath13 .",
    ".[table1 ] comparison of masses of some viruses and bacteria to the mass of a membrane oscillator ( @xmath14 = 48 pg ) that has been cooled to the quantum ground state in ref .",
    "these mass values are obtained from references @xcite . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     the change of the quality factor @xmath15 of the membrane oscillator due to an attached small microorganism ( @xmath13 ) will also be negligible . for a frozen bacterium with a smooth surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b ) , the lowest internal vibration frequency can be estimated by the speed of sound in ice divided by half of its size .",
    "so the internal vibration modes of the main body will be larger than 1  ghz for a bacterium smaller than 1  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is much larger than the frequency of the center - of - mass motion of the electromechanical membrane which is about 10 mhz .",
    "thus these internal vibration modes of the main body of a bacterium will not couple to the center - of - mass vibration of the membrane .",
    "the situation will be a little complex for bacteria that have pili on their surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]c ) @xcite . for a very thin and long pilus ,",
    "it is possible that its vibration frequency to be on the same order or even smaller than the center - of - mass vibration frequency of the electromechanical membrane .",
    "however , because the quality factors of both the pili and electromechanical membrane are expected to be very high at milikelvin temperatures , it is unlikely that their frequencies matches within their linewidths to affect the ground state cooling of the center - of - mass mode of the membrane .",
    "one can also avoid this problem by embedding the pili in water ice .",
    "we assume the frequency of the center - of - mass motion of the microorganism and the membrane together to be @xmath16 , which is almost the same as @xmath3 .",
