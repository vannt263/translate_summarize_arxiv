    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a tentative non - perturbative and background - independent quantization of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has now been demonstrated that different approaches , based on canonical quantization of gr , on covariant quantization of gr and on formal quantization of geometry lead to the very same lqg theory .",
    "although this is rather convincing , a direct experimental probe is still missing .",
    "one can easily argue that cosmology is the most promising approach to search for observational features of lqg or , more specifically , to its symmetry - reduces version , loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to the search of possible footprints of lqc in cosmological tensor modes ( see @xcite ) . at the theoretical level ,",
    "the situation is easier in this case as the algebra of constraints is automatically anomaly - free .",
    "but , as far as observations are concerned , scalar modes are far more important .",
    "they have already been observed in great details by wmap @xcite and are currently even better observed by the planck mission .",
    "the question of a possible modification of the primordial scalar power spectrum ( and of the corresponding tt @xmath1 spectrum ) in lqc is therefore essential in this framework .",
    "gravity is described by a set of constraints . however , for the ( effective ) theory to be consistent , it is mandatory that the evolution generated by the constraints remains compatible with the constraints themselves .",
    "this is always true if their mutual poisson brackets vanish when evaluated in fields fulfilling the constraints , _",
    "i.e. _ if they form a first class algebra .",
    "this means that the evolution and the gauge transformations are associated with vector fields that are tangent to the manifold of null constraints .",
    "this obviously holds at the classical level .",
    "however , when quantum modifications are added , the anomaly freedom is not anymore automatically ensured .",
    "possible quantum corrections must be restricted to those which close the algebra .",
    "this means that , for consistency reasons , the poisson brackets between any two constraints must be proportional to one constraint of the algebra .",
    "this article is devoted to the search for such an algebra for scalar perturbations .",
    "our approach will follow the one developed by bojowald _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "there are two main quantum corrections expected from lqc : inverse volume terms , basically arising for inverse powers of the densitized triad , which when quantized become an operator with zero in its discrete spectrum thus lacking a direct inverse , and holonomy corrections coming from the fact that loop quantization is based on holonomies , rather than direct connection components . in @xcite the authors focused exclusively on inverse volume corrections . here , we extend with work to the holonomy corrections .",
    "scalar perturbations with holonomy corrections have been studied in @xcite . however , the issue of anomaly freedom was not really addressed .",
    "recently , a new possible way of introducing holonomy corrections to the scalar perturbations was proposed in @xcite .",
    "although it was interestingly shown that the formulation is anomaly - free , the approach is based on the choice of the longitudinal gauge and the extension of the method to the gauge - invariant case is not straightforward . in contrast , the approach developed in our paper does not rely on any particular choice of gauge and the gauge - invariant cosmological perturbations are easily constructed .",
    "the theory of anomaly - free scalar perturbations developed in this paper is obtained on a flat frw background , such that the line element is given by : @xmath2 , \\label{lineelement}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scalar perturbation functions .",
    "the matter content is assumed to be a scalar field .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the generation of scalar perturbations during the phase of cosmic inflation while taking into account the quantum gravity effects .",

    "the method of counter - terms was earlier successfully applied to cosmological perturbations with inverse - triad corrections @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , thanks to the counter - terms , the theory of cosmological perturbations with holonomy corrections can be formulated in an anomaly - free way . the anomaly freedom was shown to be fulfilled not only for the gravity sector but also when taking into account scalar matter",
    ". the requirements of anomaly freedom were used to determine the form of the counter - terms .",
    "furthermore , conditions for obtaining and anomaly - free algebra of constraints were shown to be fulfilled only for a particular choice of the @xmath0 function , namely for the @xmath108scheme ( new quantization scheme ) .",
    "this quantization scheme was shown earlier to be favored because of the consistency of the background dynamics @xcite .",
    "our result supports these earlier claims .    in our formulation ,",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint holds its classical form , in agreement with the lqg expectations .",
    "the obtained anomaly - free gravitational hamiltonian contains seven holonomy modifications .",
    "it was also necessary to introduce one counter - term into the matter hamiltonian in order to ensure the closure of the algebra of total constraints .",
    "there is no ambiguity in defining the holonomy corrections after imposing the anomaly - free conditions .",
    "the only remaining free parameter of the theory is the area gap @xmath111 used in defining the @xmath0 function .",
    "this quantity can however be possibly fixed with the spectrum of the area operator in lqg .",
    "based on the equations derived in this paper it will also be possible to put observational constraints on the value of @xmath111 and , hence , on the critical energy density @xmath192 .",
    "based on the studied anomaly - free formulation , equations of motion were derived . as an example of application",
    ", we studied the equations in the longitudinal gauge .",
    "we have also found the gauge - invariant variables , which are holonomy - corrected versions of the bardeen potentials . using this",
    ", we have derived the equation for the mukhanov variable .",
    "this equation can be directly used to compute the power spectrum of scalar perturbations with quantum gravitational holonomy corrections .",
    "similar considerations were studied in the case of inverse - triad corrections @xcite . in that case , observational consequences have been derived and compared with cmb data @xcite .    the authors would like to thank m.  bojowald , g.  calcagni and e.  wilson - ewing for the discussions .",
