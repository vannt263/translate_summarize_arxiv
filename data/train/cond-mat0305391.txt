    "it has been recently demonstrated that , in addition to energy spectral localization ( the fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence phenomenon @xcite ) and to energy spatial localization ( soliton generation from initial data @xcite ) , a nonlinear chain of oscillators possess another striking fundamental property called _ nonlinear supratransmission _ @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was shown to occur in the nonlinear sine - gordon chain , which possess a natural forbidden band gap , when it is submitted to irradiation at a frequency in the stop gap .",
    "while in a linear chain the signal would exponentially vanish in the medium , it does not do so in the nonlinear case if its amplitude exceeds a threshold value .",
    "in @xcite the irradiation of the medium was modelized by prescribing the boundary value at one end of the chain .",
    "it is worth mentioning that nonlinear transmission does occur also in the case of a true wave scattering , namely when a monochromatic plane wave scatters onto a nonlinear medium with a frequency in the gap @xcite .    in the case of the sine - gordon model",
    ", the threshold can be predicted exactly by invoking the static one - breather solution @xcite . in short",
    ", energy penetrates the medium as soon as the amplitude @xmath0 of the harmonic driving , at a frequency @xmath1 in the gap , exceeds the maximum amplitude of the static breather of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "this energy travels then through the medium by means of nonlinear localized excitations ( kinks , breathers , solitons ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , after recalling results of @xcite , to display experimental results on the mechanical chain of pendula and to discuss the generality of our result by exploring extensions to different situations .",
    "we shall in particular explore the robustness of nonlinear supratransmission when the medium experiences damping , different nonlinearities and different classes of boundary values .",
    "the next section is devoted to a short reminder of the results published in @xcite and it is intended to settle formalism and basic facts about nonlinear supratransmission .",
    "the model is the sine - gordon chain submitted to a dirichlet condition at the origin on a vanishing initial background ( pendula at rest ) .",
    "then section [ sec : experiment ] relates the experiment made with a mechanical pendula chain , coupled by means of a coil spring , and which is forced at one end by a periodic torque .",
    "a systematic exploration of the chain response in a frequency range within the gap shows spectacular agreement with the theory . in section [ sec : charact ] we numerically describe the characteristics of the breathers generated in the sine - gordon chain and discover some simple relations between the parameters of the emitted breather with respect to those of the boundary driving . the section [ sec : energy ] deals with the energy transmitted by the nonlinear medium as a function of the driving amplitude at given frequency in the gap .",
    "particular emphasis will be put on the effectiveness of the effect in different , not necessarily integrable , cases .",
    "the nonlinear instability which is the generating mechanism of nonlinear supratransmission is briefly discussed in section [ sec : instab ] .",
    "although the mathematical analysis is still to be constructed we propose a quite simple illustration of the process by a perturbative analysis of the sine - gordon system driven close to a breather mode .    as another domain of study , we consider in section [ sec : josephson ] the sine - gordon model for neumann conditions at the boundary ( the derivative at the origin is prescribed ) .",
    "this is a model for a chain of short josephson junctions whose first one is submitted to an external ac current . by using numerical simulations ,",
    "the process of nonlinear supratransmission is shown to hold , and the threshold of energy transmission to obey a similar simple rule .",
    "remarkably , in this case the energy flows by means of kink ( or anti - kinks ) and not by breathers ( or kink anti - kink pairs ) .",
    "this is an interesting issue in view of applications as kinks are the objects that have an experimental signature ( through the josephson current ) .",
    "the following normalized discrete sine - gordon chain of @xmath2 locally damped coupled oscillators @xmath3 @xmath4 is submitted to the boundary value at the origin ( dirichlet condition ) @xmath5 acting on a medium initially at rest , namely @xmath6 in this section the damping coefficient @xmath7 is used to model a semi - infinite chain by an absorbing boundary .",
    "more precisely we take @xmath8 with @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath10 is adjusted to have a damping factor @xmath11 varying slowly from almost @xmath12 to almost @xmath13 on the last @xmath14 particles .",
    "a typical experiment will have e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that in section [ sec : josephson ] we shall use instead the reflective boundary condition @xmath19 for an homogeneous damping @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "the equation is considered as a second - order ordinary differential system for the @xmath2 coupled oscillators @xmath3 .",
    "this system is then solved with the subroutine dsolve of maple software package which uses a fehlberg fourth - fifth order runge - kutta method .",

    "the spectrum of the breather signal does not match exactly the monochromatic forcing and it adapts by sending phonons at third , fifth , etc ... , harmonic frequencies .",
    "the above assertion is checked by performing two simulations of at a given forcing frequency , say @xmath33 , and a given amplitude , say @xmath34 , in one case with the harmonic forcing , in the other case with the breather - like forcing @xmath35 where the value of @xmath31 is calculated from with @xmath34 . to avoid initial shock we also set initial velocities matching the ones of the static breather .",
    "then we evaluate by fourier transform the spectra of one particle of the chain in both cases ( we have selected the particle 50 on a chain of 100 pendula ) .",
    "the result is displayed on figure [ fig : spectra - comp ] where we see that phonons at frequency @xmath36 are indeed emitted for harmonic forcing while no phonon appear for a breather - like forcing .",
    "the small contribution at frequency @xmath37 in figure ( a ) represents a collective motion of the pendula generated by the initial shock resulting from inadequation of the initial velocities with the boundary value .",
    "the adjustment of the breather center @xmath31 provided by not always has a solution .",
    "indeed it works up to the maximum value @xmath38 of the breather amplitude realized for @xmath39 . beyond this threshold , for a driving boundary with @xmath40 , we have shown in @xcite that nonlinear supratransmission occurs , i.e. the medium starts to transmit energy by means of nonlinear modes generation ( breathers and kink - antikink pairs ) . from , the threshold @xmath41 reads as the following function of the frequency @xmath1 @xmath42,\\ ] ] which has the approximate value @xmath43.\\ ] ] which would hold for the continuous sine - gordon equation obtained in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "note that the maximum difference ( when @xmath1 varies in @xmath45 $ ] ) between the above two expressions is already @xmath46 for @xmath47 and goes down to @xmath48 for @xmath49 , the value we have used in most of the numerical simulations .",
    "this qualitative definition of a bifurcation threshold can be checked on numerical simulations of with the boundary condition by varying , at given frequency @xmath1 , the amplitude @xmath0 around the above value @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) .",
    "there are many means to determine appearance of nonlinear supratransmission , a simple one being the observation of the motion of one particle of the chain . as an example we display in figure [ fig : motions ] the motion of the particle @xmath52 of a chain of @xmath53 particles driven at frequency @xmath54 at amplitudes @xmath55 ( no supratransmission ) and @xmath56 ( supratransmission ) for a coupling factor @xmath57 .",
    "each large oscillation in the second figure corresponds to a breather passing by .",
    "two of them are generated and cross the site @xmath52 at times @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the small oscillation seen between the humps are the harmonic phonons , mainly of frequency @xmath36 .    for illustration",
    "we show on figure [ fig : actual ] a picture of oscillators amplitude @xmath3 at given time ( here @xmath60 ) in the case of nonlinear supratransmission obtained for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "a first breather propagates to the right while a second one is just being generated near the origin .",
    "note the amplitude of the breather with respect to the one of the driving boundary .    by a systematic exploration of the chain response",
    "we draw figure [ fig : bif ] obtained for @xmath53 particles with a coupling @xmath63 ( some experiments have been actually made with smaller coupling and less number of points to shorten computation times ) for a typical time of @xmath53 ( for frequencies close to the gap value @xmath37 , time had to be increased up to @xmath64 ) .",
    "the points on figure [ fig : bif ] are obtained with an absolute precision of @xmath65 for the amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "they are compared to the theoretical threshold expression ( continuous curve ) .",
    "the figure [ fig : bif ] shows excellent agreement to formula apart for some discrepancies starting below @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this results from the driving which , thanks to the nonlinearity , generates phonons at multiple frequencies ( here third , fifth , etc ... ) .",
    "if these frequencies lie in the phonon band , the phonons move away from the boundary and have no effect on the forcing .",
    "if however they lie in the fbg , the related phonons do not propagate ( which we call phonon quenching ) and stick on the boundary where they add contribution to the driving .",
    "this effect indeed disappears when driving the system with the exact breather boundary value @xmath35 for which we have checked that nonlinear supratransmission _ never occurs _ at an amplitude @xmath68 , while it occurs already at @xmath38 ( or for very small deformation of the perfect breather ) .",
    "our purpose here is to show that the process of nonlinear supratransmission can be easily realized experimentally on a chain of coupled pendula as depicted in figure [ fig : chaine ] .",
    "this chain has been built following m. remoissenet @xcite .",
    "the pendula rotate freely around a piano wire stretched between two supports , they are coupled together by a coil spring tightened to each pendulum by a screw .",
    "such a chain of 48 pendula is driven by an electrical engine steered by a generator of sinusoidal tension . upon varying the frequency , at low amplitude , in the phonon band",
    ", we can determine the parameters of the chain ( coupling constant @xmath69 and angular eigenfrequency @xmath70 ) by measuring the wavelength @xmath71 of produced wave ( in units of pendula number ) .",
    "by comparison to the dispersion relation of the linear chain @xmath72 we determined the following parameter values @xmath73 then in a time normalized to the eigenfrequency , we have the dispersion relation with @xmath74 which is the fundamental parameter of the model , entering in particular expression of the threshold amplitude for nonlinear supratransmission .",
    "this is the formula we want here to confront to experiments .",
    "we proceed with a systematic exploration of the chain response to a signal frequency in the gap ( of value less than @xmath70 ) .",
    "the method consist in increasing slowly , at fixed frequency , the amplitude of the driving , up to the time when a nonlinear mode is seen to be generated ( a picture of a breather generated at a frequency of @xmath75 in normalized units is displayed in @xcite ) . repeating 3 times , for each driving frequency value , the measurements of the driving amplitude that generates a nonlinear mode",
    ", we eventually obtain the figure [ fig : exp - res ] which displays the measured threshold amplitude in terms of the signal frequency ( normalized ) . there",
    ", the full line curve is the function @xmath76 given in with @xmath77 .    despite the small number of pendula ,",
    "inducing reflection at the open end , the inherent damping , and other mechanical imperfections , the experiments provide a spectacular realization of the theoretical threshold prediction .",
    "one important issue concerns the nature and the characteristics of the nonlinear modes which propagate in the medium . in the first instance",
    ", we have to check that the emitted structures correctly match the moving breather , at velocity @xmath78 , which is convenient to write as @xmath79\\ .\\ ] ] by choosing correctly the two parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 which represent respectively the amplitude and the group velocity of the breather , together with the space and time origins of the solution @xmath82 , one can match it to the asymptotic numerical solution with high precision .",
    "this enables us to identify correctly the emitted breathers , to determine their characteristic with a great accuracy , and to observe their possible disintegration into kink - antikink pairs .",
    "the results of such estimations are displayed in figure [ fig : ampl - breath ] obtained as follows . for each driving frequency @xmath1",
    ", we have driven the system at threshold amplitude @xmath76 and then determined at the the parameters @xmath83 of the emitted breathers ( a given experiment at threshold driving produces repeatedly the same breather ) .",
    "then the amplitude of the propagating breather is plotted as a function of the amplitude of excitation @xmath76 for various frequencies .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig : vit - breath ] shows the group velocity of the breather as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "both figures [ fig : ampl - breath ] and [ fig : vit - breath ] correspond to a region of the driving frequency close to the gap @xmath84 . for lower frequencies the emitted breathers ,",
    "when they occur , are unstable and decay into kink - antikink pairs ( this will be discussed later ) .",
    "the main conclusion here is the existence of a linear relation between the amplitude @xmath85 ( and the velocity @xmath81 ) of the generated breather and the driving amplitude at threshold @xmath41 .",
    "so far we have no theoretical interpretation of these observations .",
    "another characteristic of the breather is its proper frequency @xmath86 , related to the apparent pulsation period @xmath87 by the usual ( relativistic ) relation @xmath88 this frequency is plotted in figure [ fig : freq - breath ] as a function of the driving frequency @xmath1 and , again , we note a non trivial linear dependence .",
    "we now turn to the stability of the emitted breathers which , for @xmath89 decay into kink - antikink pairs .",
    "this can be qualitatively described by studying the binding energy @xmath90 , given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the single kink energy and @xmath93 the breather energy @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the binding energy @xmath90 of the breathers produced in the simulations ( by plugging in ( [ binding - e ] ) the measured values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , the result of which is plotted in figure [ fig : energ - breath ] in terms of the frequency @xmath1 of the driving boundary .",
    "this figure shows that the binding energy of the breather decreases with the driving frequency , and goes to zero for @xmath94 .",
    "thus the breather decay in the frequency range @xmath95 $ ] is well understood from formula ( [ binding - e ] ) .",
    "nonlinear supratransmission is a process where large amount of energy flows through the medium .",
    "our purpose here is to evaluate numerically this energy for amplitudes around the threshold value .",
    "the theoretical expression of the energy flow is calculated hereafter for a generic nonlinearity deriving from a potential energy @xmath96 ( the sine - gordon case corresponds to @xmath97 ) .    from the energy density @xmath98 and the evolution equation",
    "follow the conservation law @xmath99 with the current @xmath100 incorporating the potential energy resulting from the coupling of the first particle @xmath101 to the boundary @xmath102 , the _ total energy _ of the system reads @xmath103 in our case @xmath104 is the driving and the chain is supposed infinite with @xmath105 as @xmath106 .    upon time derivation , with help of the conservation law , and using the assumed asymptotic @xmath107 for large @xmath21 ,",
    "we arrive eventually at @xmath108 hence the total energy injected in the medium during time @xmath87 reads @xmath109.\\ ] ] choosing for @xmath87 an integer multiple of the period of excitation makes this energy to vanish identically in the linear case if the driving frequency falls in the fbg .      in the nonlinear case ,",
    "expression is computed numerically on a chain of 60 particles with a coupling parameter @xmath57 and an absorbing end working over the last 40 particles . for a driving frequency @xmath54 and amplitudes running from @xmath110 to @xmath111",
    ", we obtain the figure [ fig : sg-09 ] where the bifurcation is seen to occur for @xmath112 , the value predicted by formula .",
    "this simulation has been run for frequencies in the range @xmath113 $ ] , with comparable expected results .",
    "our approach stems from the existence of a breather solution of the model equation , allowing to determine the threshold amplitude .",
    "it is then worth wondering if the process is robust _ against _ non - integrability .    to give a partial still instructive answer to this question",
    ", we have performed numerical simulations of two non - integrable evolution in the same class , i.e. with hamiltonian .",
    "first the taylor truncated expansion of sine - gordon ( fifth order is kept to ensure a confining potential at large @xmath114 ) reads as the nonlinear klein - gordon chain : @xmath115 this system is solved with the boundary driving ( [ forcing ] ) and the energy ( [ energy ] ) is computed for the same parameter values as for figure [ fig : sg-09 ] .",
    "the result is displayed on figure [ fig : kg-09 ] .    by scanning the frequency range in the gap ,",
    "we have obtained that the process occurs down to @xmath116 and then disappears .",
    "we suspect that for such a polynomial potential energy , at high forcing amplitude , the _ incoming wave _ sees an almost parabolic potential , while for low amplitude driving the _ incoming wave _ does feel the actual structure of the local potential .",
    "another interesting non integrable hamiltonian evolution where the local potential has a periodic structure is the double sine - gordon chain @xmath117=0 , \\quad n=1,\\cdots , n\\ .\\ ] ] once again we have solved this system in the same situation as before and obtained the brutal energy flow of figure [ fig : dsg-09 ] . in this case the process holds for any frequency ( tested from @xmath118 ) just as in the sine - gordon case .",
    "thus we have seen that in those two cases nonlinear supratransmission does work which is a strong indication that it is a generic nonlinear process .",
    "an interesting question is the mechanism that generates nonlinear supratransmission , which is discussed now .",
    "the process at the origin of nonlinear supratransmission is a nonlinear instability .",
    "although it is not yet fully understood , we discuss here some of its relevant aspects .    to that end",
    "we explore the properties of the sine - gordon chain submitted to initial - boundary value data that precisely mimic the breather @xmath119 centered at @xmath39 as defined in and which is convenient to write as @xmath120 note that this is an exact solution in the continuous limit @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    in order to study the behavior at the threshold",
    ", we impose the boundary value @xmath123 together with compatible initial data @xmath124 the boundary value at the other end of the chain ( @xmath125 ) can be taken as an absorbing end to simulate the infinite line or as the breather value @xmath126 , e.g. to check the accuracy of the solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath127 measures the departure from the exact solution .",
    "we are of course interested in what happens when @xmath127 is positive .",
    "for @xmath128 we simply generate the approximate solution @xmath119 which in the numerical simulations is marginaly stable ( and would be indeed stable for a breather centered in @xmath129 ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath130 , the numerical simulations of the sine - gordon model immediately generate nonlinear supratransmission . from the initial - boundary value problem , it is natural to seek a solution as a perturbation of the breather under the form @xmath131 which by obeys at order 1 in @xmath127 @xmath132 the variable coefficients @xmath133 and @xmath134 of this equation are given by @xmath135    the initial - boundary value problem that goes with can be taken to results from , namely @xmath136 with the related initial data .",
    "then we observe the following fundamental facts :    * for @xmath137 the system is stable showing a long period oscillatory behavior , * for @xmath130 the system is unstable showing an exponential growth of the oscillations .",
    "these observations are illustrated by figure [ fig : lin ] where we have computed the energy transmitted by the chain according to formula , as a function of time ( the points in time are chosen as integer multiples of the period @xmath138 ) .",
    "the parameters related to this experiments are @xmath15 , @xmath49 and the energy has been calculated for 10 points ( up to @xmath139 ) .    we have also displayed results for the _ linear version _ of system ( read with @xmath128 ) which is marginaly unstable showing a linear growth of the oscillations . the exponential growth in the case @xmath130 is the signature of the instability which is the mechanism of nonlinear supratransmission .",
    "the mathematical approach of this instability for is reported to future studies .",
    "a josephson junction behaves just like a single pendulum , the rotation amplitude being replaced by the phase difference between wave functions of cooper pairs @xcite . by connecting the junctions in parallel with super - conducting wires , the resulting model equation is just the sine - gordon discrete system submitted to damping and constant torque @xcite @xmath140 here above @xmath7 is the constant damping along the array , @xmath141 is the normalized intensity of the applied current and time has been normalized to the plasma frequency .",
    "we consider here only the one - dimensional geometry but it is worth mentioning the coupled arrays ( ladders ) who revealed as a means to generate discrete breathers by convenient initial conditions @xcite with subsequent striking experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "the applied current can have a dc component ( the so - called bias ) and an ac driving part .",
    "the problem we are interested in is the behavior of the above chain initially at rest and whose first junction only is submitted to ac driving at a frequency @xmath1 in the gap and intensity @xmath142 .",
    "then the model results as for @xmath143 and the bias @xmath144 together with the following relation for @xmath145 : @xmath146    it is important to remark that the above equation can be equivalently written as the _ discrete neumann condition _",
    "@xmath147 when the system is assumed to hold also for @xmath145 .",
    "this remark actually allows us to consider the continuous limit in order to determine the prediction of the threshold of nonlinear supratransmission .",
    "the continuous version of and boundary value , for the variable @xmath148 and @xmath149 , reads as the system @xmath150 where we have defined @xmath151 .",
    "this continous version corresponds to a long josephson junction whose extremity @xmath152 is submitted to external micro - wave irradiation , the amplitude @xmath153 being then related to the external magnetic field intensity @xcite .",
    "this is a neumann boundary condition for the sine - gordon continuous equation .",
    "the system will then adapt the breather _ derivative _ at the boundary centered in @xmath154 , namely @xmath155 where now the continuous version of the dispersion relation is @xmath156 for evanescent waves ( due to the change of space variable , we have @xmath157 where @xmath26 is defined in ) .    upon varying the position @xmath158 , the above expression has a maximum value for @xmath159 given by @xmath160 and the related maximum amplitude of the derivative eventually results as the simple expression @xmath161 this is the threshold prediction for the neumann condition and we are going now to check it on numerical simulations .    as in section",
    "[ sec : sg ] , we solve the discrete system with no constant bias ( @xmath162 ) , without damping in a first stage ( @xmath163 ) , for a chain of @xmath52 particles with an absorbing boundary on the last @xmath164 , and with a coupling factor @xmath165 .",
    "the result is displayed on figure [ fig : bif - jj ] which shows good agreement except maybe around the frequencies @xmath66 and @xmath67 as in figure [ fig : bif ] ( for the same reasons ) and close to the phonon band , which is due to the absorbing end .",
    "here above the situation is that of a quasi - continuous undamped and semi - infinite sine - gordon chain submitted to neumann condition a the origin .",
    "we turn back now to the discrete case , a one - dimensional finite - length ( open - ended ) array of coupled short josephson junctions , where the first pendulum is submitted to an external ac driving .",
    "namely we consider the _ josephson transmission line _",
    "system @xmath166 nonlinear supratransmission becomes here the property of the jtl to transmit energy under the form of kinks ( or anti - kinks ) as soon as the intensity @xmath142 of the ac driving of the first junction exceeds the threshold @xmath167 as given by the definition @xmath168 and from expression .",
    "a new fact here is that , for neumann type boundary conditions as , only kinks ( or anti - kinks ) are produced , not breathers .",
    "this is the result of the fact that producing a kink cost half of the energy used to produce a breather , and of the freedom left on the boundary value @xmath104 ( only the difference @xmath169 is prescribed ) allowing full @xmath170-rotations .",
    "for dirichlet boundary condition as in preceding sections , the precription of @xmath104 , e.g. by prevents full rotation .    to illustrate this property we draw in figure [ fig : out - kink ] a typical simulation with the following set of parameters @xmath171 constituting a reasonable choice for an experimental situation . at frequency @xmath116 ,",
    "the threshold is @xmath172 and for an ac driving at amplitude @xmath173 the chain starts to _ rotate _ , which means that a number of kinks ( elementary @xmath170 rotation ) are generated by the ac driving . in the case of figure [ fig : out - kink ] about @xmath174 kinks have been generated during @xmath175 units of normalized time .",
    "note that we have assumed a small constant bias dc current @xmath176 in order to select kinks instead of possible anti - kinks .",
    "however the process does work without bias , though in some of the experiments the rotation would stop after some time ( for a reason that we do not understand ) .",
