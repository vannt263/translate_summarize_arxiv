    "quantum entanglement dating back to einsten s and schrdinger s seminal papers  @xcite has emerged as one of the most active research areas of contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "the interest is motivated both , by the important promise of utilizing entanglement effects in communication and computation technologies ,  @xcite and by the intellectual appeal of dealing with the most fundamental issues of quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite one of the major experimental tasks is the creation of and subsequent manipulation by the entangled quantum states .",
    "a cooper pair comprising two electrons endowed with a unique inseparable quantum state is a natural source of electrons with states inextricably linked to each other and remaining entangled with respect to spin and/or energy despite having become spatially separated .",
    "@xcite the initial stage of splitting can occur via an andreev reflection ( ar ) phenomenon ,  @xcite see fig .  , where the cooper pair crosses the ideal normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) interface and enters normal metal as two electrons entangled with respect to energy and spin , more precisely , the electron - like quasiparticle enters and hole - like quasiparticle leaves normal metal , with the probability of unity . applying the external magnetic field , one can take electrons and holes further apart .",
    "@xcite    a different recipe for the cooper pair splitting ( cps ) and spatial separation of electrons and holes  @xcite proposed the normal - metal fork with leads linked to a superconductor by the ns barriers with the different resonance energies .",
    "this idea evolved into a crossed andreev reflection ( car ) approach for cps , utilizing two - terminal configuration in which a cooper pair generates electrons escaping through two _ separated _ normal terminals  @xcite as shown in fig .  .",
    "yet at first sight this approach seemed to be problematic : since the initial separation of exiting electron is the size of the cooper pair , the escape probability was to remain appreciable only for terminal separation not much exceeding the coherence length .",
    "furthermore , the car probability is exactly zero in a one - dimensional geometry with the ideal ns boundary , see fig .  .",
    "in higher dimensions , the amplitude of the car decays exponentially with the distance  @xmath0 between the terminals . what more , in clean @xmath1-dimensional superconductors it acquires a small prefactor @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in three - dimensional disordered superconductors the amplitude drops by the factor @xmath3 with  @xmath4 being the fermi wave vector and @xmath5 being the mean - free path .  @xcite    this suppression of the car efficiency was mended by making the normal scattering amplitudes at the ns interface the energy dependent ones over the scale of order of the superconducting gap @xmath6 , in such a way that they became essentially different for electrons and holes .",
    "this was implemented via setting up quantum dots endowed with the different resonance levels at the ns interfaces .",
    "varying the gates potentials one could appropriately change the positions of these resonances with respect to the fermi level , see fig .  .",
    "thus the efficiency of the two - terminal configuration for the cps was enhanced by plugging a quantum dot into the each lead ,  @xcite and utilizing coulomb blockade for manipulating the electrons .",
    "the similar idea of utilizing asymmetric quantum dots was adopted for studying the dynamic conductance and noise in dot - superconductor - dot systems.@xcite reference   calculated noise in the framework of the tight - binding model for a setup comprising a superconductor and and two metal leads attached at the same side .",
    "reference   addressed the noise in a n - dot - s - dot - n system . the analytical result although somewhat cumbersome for differential conductance and noise was derived in ref .  .",
    "in the meantime , it was shown experimentally that using nanowires ,  @xcite carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite and graphene  @xcite to split cooper pairs one can achieve from a few percents to near - unity efficiency .",
    "this stimulated a parallel theoretical development .",
    "in particular , a scheme realizing asymmetric dots via attaching n- and p - type semiconductor quantum dots at either sides of a superconductor was proposed in ref .  .",
    "it was demonstrated that choosing specific relations between the valence bands and bias voltage one can achieve the 100% efficiency .",
    "reference   dealt with the effects of the coulomb and spin - orbit interactions on the cps efficiency also showing the feasibility of the 100% efficiency even in the presence of interactions .    in the present work",
    "we investigate a minimalistic model allowing for a 100% efficiency .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional car - based splitter with the initially zero car amplitude . adding an energy - dependent double barrier to each terminal of the setup shown in fig .",
    ", we demonstrate that in an equilibrium noninteracting system the proper tuning resonance levels in separately biased output terminals can provide the hundred percent outcome .",
    "this simple model utilizes non - equal transmission amplitudes of the electron and hole - like bogoliubov quasiparticles ( below the superconducting gap ) across the energy dependent scatterer and , remarkably , allow for a full analytical treatment .",
    "we further consider the splitter comprising the y - geometry junctions , each connected to the respective infinite superconductors , capturing the main features of experimental setups , and show that the 100% outcome holds in this geometry as well .",
    "we derive a simple analytical result for a stationary josephson effect situation where fermi levels of both terminals are set equal by using a grounded superconductor .",
    "the simple model of the proposed setup allows for a detailed quantitative analysis revealing the underlying subtleties and conditions necessary for achieving a 100% outcome .",

    "we quantify the entangler efficiency by transparency i.e. by the probability for the incident electron to reach a superconductor through one terminal having created a cooper pair in the superconductor and a hole that left the entangler through the other terminal .",
    "our idea is to control the resonance structure of the bogoliubov states by setting double - barrier potentials in such a way that for specific resonance energies in a hybrid structure  @xcite the electron - to - hole transmission probability became equal to unity , in full analogy with fabry - prot interferometer . to gain a feeling how the perfect transmission can be reached",

    "first , we have demonstrated that the unitary limit is strikingly robust against random deviation of scatterer s parameters from the perfect symmetry .",
    "second , it is important that the interference process providing the unitary cps limit can be achieved by contribution from two paths like in mach - zehnder interferometer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_nsn ] .",
    "this loosens the conditions for the system dimension tuning that ensures the maximal efficiency and suggests that the efficient cps may hold in a higher dimensionality . indeed , relevant semi - classical trajectories connecting two dots at the opposite terminals ( like in the experiment of ref .   with about 10% efficiency )",
    "mimic a 1d situation and at the same time provide fair probability for dots to be joined , even though the traveling wave packets may laterally spread .",
    "however , straightforward mapping of the experimental situation onto the 2d dirty - superconductor model gives about two orders of magnitude less than in the experiment .",
    "our findings suggest resolution of this controversy .",
    "furthermore , our prediction that the maximal cps efficiency is expected at @xmath175 and the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : tmax ] compare nicely with the experimental result , provided we substitute @xmath176 by the coherence length @xmath177 corresponding to the experimental diffusive case .    to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that the outcome of cooper pair splitting via the crossed andreev transport in a one - dimensional hybrid system , comprising a superconductor sandwiched between the two normal metal terminals endowed with the double point scatterers , can achieve a robust unitary limit stable against asymmetry of the scatterers .",
    "we found that the electron - to - hole transmission probability ( per a conducting channel ) across such a system achieves its maximum if the width of the superconductor is of the order of the coherence length .",
    "our study opens a route to reliable high - outcome procedure for creating entangled electrons .",
