    "despite the remarkable success of the minimal standard model ( msm ) in describing elementary particle interactions at presently accessible energies , there is little direct experimental information on the mechanism which generates mass for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons . in the msm ,",
    "spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is responsible for mass generation .",
    "the existence of the higgs boson in the msm is a direct consequence of this mechanism .",
    "complementary to the direct higgs boson search at colliders ( @xmath3  gev  @xcite from lep1 , where @xmath4 is the higgs boson mass ) , indirect information on @xmath4 can be extracted by confronting theoretical predictions for radiative corrections to electroweak observables with high precision measurements .",
    "assuming that the msm is valid , a global fit to the currently available data from lep and slc with @xmath5 , the top quark mass ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath4 as free parameters yields @xmath7 gev  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained in ref .",
    "the indirect constraints on @xmath4 are expected to improve considerably in the future with more precise measurements of the top quark mass and the @xmath1 boson mass ( @xmath8 ) . presently , their world averages are @xmath9  gev  @xcite and @xmath10  gev  @xcite .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath8 is therefore one of the priorities of future collider experiments .",
    "lep2 and runii at fermilab ( @xmath11  fb@xmath12 ) are aiming for an uncertainty on @xmath8 of about 40 mev  @xcite and 35 mev ( per experiment )  @xcite , respectively .",
    "further upgrades of the tevatron accelerator complex ( tev33 ) could yield an overall integrated luminosity of @xmath13 , and a precision of @xmath8 of about 15 mev  @xcite .",
    "finally , it may be possible to measure @xmath8 at the lhc with an accuracy better than 15  mev , if an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath12 is accumulated with the accelerator operating at a reduced luminosity of about @xmath14 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    obviously , to measure @xmath8 with high precision , it is crucial to fully control higher order electroweak ( ew ) and qcd radiative corrections .    in this contribution",
    "we present some results of a new calculation of the ew @xmath0 corrections to @xmath1 boson production in hadronic collisions .",
    "in particular , we study the effect of these corrections on the @xmath1 transverse mass ( @xmath15 ) distribution from which @xmath8 is extracted at the tevatron . in a previous calculation",
    "@xcite , only the final state photonic corrections had been included , using an approximation in which the sum of the virtual and soft part is indirectly estimated from the inclusive @xmath16 @xmath17 width and the final state hard bremsstrahlung contribution .",
    "our calculation includes both initial and ( complete ) final state corrections , as well as their interference . as a result of our calculation ,",
    "the current systematic uncertainty of @xmath18 mev  @xcite originating from ew radiative corrections will be reduced .",
    "we shall only discuss the @xmath19 decay channel here .",
    "more details and a discussion of the @xmath20 decay channel will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "when calculating the ew radiative corrections to resonant @xmath1 boson production the problem arises how to treat an unstable charged gauge boson consistently in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "this problem has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with particular emphasis on finding a gauge invariant decomposition of the ew @xmath0 corrections into a qed - like and a modified weak part . unlike the @xmath2 boson case",
    ", the feynman diagrams which involve a virtual photon do not represent a gauge invariant subset here . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that gauge invariant contributions can be extracted from the infrared ( ir ) singular virtual photonic corrections .",
    "these contributions can be combined with the real photon corrections in the soft photon region to form gauge invariant qed - like contributions corresponding to initial state , final state and interference corrections .",
    "the soft photon region is defined by requiring that the photon energy in the parton center of mass frame , @xmath21 , is smaller than a cutoff @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the parton center of mass energy . in this phase space region , the soft photon approximation can be used to calculate the cross section as long as @xmath24 is sufficiently small . throughout the calculation the soft singularities have been regularized by giving the photon a fictitious mass . in the sum of the virtual and soft photon terms the unphysical photon mass dependence cancels , and the qed - like contributions are ir finite",
    ".    the ir finite remainder of the virtual photonic corrections and the weak one - loop corrections can be combined to separately gauge invariant modified weak contributions to the @xmath1 boson production and decay process .",
    "both the qed - like and the modified weak contributions can be expressed in terms of form factors , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which multiply the born cross section  @xcite .",
    "the superscript @xmath27 in the form factors denotes the initial state , final state or interference contributions .",
    "the complete @xmath28 parton level cross section of resonant @xmath1 production via the drell - yan mechanism @xmath29 can then be written as follows  @xcite : @xmath30 }   \\\\ & & + \\sum_{a = initial , final,\\atop interf . } [ d\\hat\\sigma^{(0)}\\ ;   f_{q\\!e\\!d}^a(\\hat s,\\hat t)+ d \\hat \\sigma_{2\\rightarrow 3}^a ] \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the born cross section , @xmath31 , is of breit - wigner form and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the usual mandelstam variables in the parton center of mass frame . the modified weak contributions have to be evaluated at @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the ir finite contribution @xmath35 describes real photon radiation with @xmath36 .",
    "additional singularities occur when the photon is emitted collinear with one of the charged fermions .",
    "these collinear singularities have been regularized by retaining finite fermion masses .",
    "thus , both @xmath37 and @xmath25 ( @xmath38 ) contain large mass singular logarithms which have to be treated with special care . in the case of final state photon radiation ,",
    "the mass singular logarithms cancel when inclusive observables are considered ( kln theorem ) . for exclusive quantities , however , these logarithms can result in large corrections , and it may be necessary to perform a resummation of the soft and/or collinear photon emission terms .",
    "for initial state photonic corrections , the mass singular logarithms survive .",
    "these terms are universal to all orders in perturbation theory , and can therefore be cancelled by universal collinear counterterms generated by ` renormalizing ' the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , in complete analogy to gluon emission in qcd .",
    "to increase the numerical stability , it is advantageous to extract the collinear part from @xmath37 for both the initial and final state , and perform the cancellation of the mass singular logarithms analytically .",
    "the collinear region is defined by requiring that the angle between the fermion and the emitted photon is smaller than a cutoff parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the reduced @xmath40 contribution , which comprises the real photon contribution away from the soft and collinear region , is evaluated numerically using standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "our method is very similar to the phase space slicing method described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the analytic cancellation of the final state mass singular logarithms is only possible when realistic experimental electron identification requirements are taken into account .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
