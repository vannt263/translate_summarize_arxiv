    "one of the consequence of einstein general relativity is that light is deflected by the gravitational field of an object with an angle of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the deflector and @xmath5 is the impact parameter of the light ray @xcite . in the case of lensing of a background star by another star ,",
    "this deflection creates extra images of a background object where the images are too close to be resolved by the ground - base telescopes .",
    "this type of lensing is called gravitational microlensing . in 1936 , einstein said `` there is a little chance of observing gravitational lensing caused by the stellar mass lenses '' .",
    "however , after several decades , using advanced cameras and computers , and following the propose of paczyski ( 1986 ) , the first microlensing event has been discovered by alcock et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "the aim of the microlensing observational groups such as macho , eros and ogle @xcite has been to monitor stars the large and the small magellanic clouds in order to detect the massive compact halo objects ( machos ) of the halo using gravitational microlensing .",
    "the passage of the machos from the line of sight of the background stars causes an achromatic magnification of the background stars with a specific shape . comparing the number of the observed events with that expected from the halo models",
    "have shown that machos made up less than 20 per cent of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "they can not cover all the dark matter budget of the halo . in this paper , we question further the existence of machos on cosmological scales , and suggest a strategy for observation using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_.    gravitational microlensing towards the source stars beyond the galactic halo can be performed with an observational method - so - called pixel lensing- which is different to the conventional method . when the background stars are too far and the field is too dense to be resolved , using this method a high magnification microlensing event can change the light flux in each pixel . by recording the time variation of the light in each pixel , it is possible to recognize a microlensing event @xcite .",
    "an important factor for increasing the sensitivity of the observations when using the pixel lensing is the size of point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "several groups as mega , agape and angstrom , have monitored m31 .",
    "they have found few pixel - lensing candidates in this direction @xcite .",
    "gould ( 1995 ) proposed the extension of pixel lensing to cosmological scales , using the observation by the hst towards the virgo cluster .",
    "he proposed an investigation of the intercluster machos and obtained a theoretical optical depth of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of halo composed of machos @xcite .",
    "the detection threshold of an event was defined by the accumulation of the signal to noise of the events for the duration that an event is observable .",
    "so , in this observation , one would expect to detect microlensing events with a long duration and a low peak in light curve .",
    "the estimation obtained for the rate of events with this observational threshold was @xmath8 .",
    "baltz et al ( 2004 ) used the _ hst _ for pixel lensing and monitored m87 for one month , using with the strategy of taking one date point per day .",
    "after data reduction , seven candidates remained . with further investigation of the light curves in two different colors they concluded that one candidate could be a microlensing event . comparing the observational result with the expectation from generating synthetic light curves",
    ", they concluded that the fraction of machos in both the milky way and the virgo halos are almost equal @xcite .",
    "however , the problem with this statistical analysis is that one microlensing event has a large statistical uncertainty . in order to have a better estimation of the machos in the virgo cluster , we need to be observed more events .    in this work",
    "we extend the work by gould ( 1995 ) and baltz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and we propose an alternative observational strategy using the _ hst_. our suggestion is to observe the very high magnification events in m87 , which has a variation in its light curve in the order @xmath9 d. in order to improve the sensitivity of observing of short duration events , we need to increase the sampling rate by the order of @xmath9 h. we propose intensive short - duration observation of m87 of the order of @xmath9 h using the wide field planetary camera 3 ( wfc3 ) of the _",
    "hst_. we suggest taking one date point in each orbit and collecting about @xmath10 photometric data point per every @xmath11 h. this strategy will enable us to detect very high magnification short - transit pixel lensing events .",
    "first , we make a rough calculation to estimate the optical depth and the detection rate of the events using this observational strategy . in order to have a better estimation , we continue with a monte - carlo simulation for three observational programs of @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 d. we examine how sensitivity the results are to the duration of the observational program .",
    "we show that with @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 d of intensive observation with the _ hst _ , it is possible to detect @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 events per day , respectively .",
    "we also simulate the observation using the strategy of baltz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with the cadence of @xmath9 d , and find @xmath16 event per day for one month observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theopt ] , we introduce the virgo cluster and obtain the theoretical optical depth and the event rate of the high magnification events from structures along the line of sight . in section [ mont ] , we perform a monte - carlo simulation to obtain the number of the high- magnification events found with the _ hst_. the results are given in section [ results ] . in section [ conc ]",
    "we give our conclusion .",
    "virgo cluster contains @xmath17 galaxies and is located about @xmath18 mpc from us .",
    "it has am apparent size of @xmath19 and coordinate of ra@xmath20 and de@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the brightest galaxy of this cluster is m87 which is located at the center of this structure .",
    "similar to the local group , the mass of the virgo cluster is mainly made up of dark matter . with microlensing of the virgo cluster ,",
    "it could be possible estimate the fraction of machos in the halo of this structure .",
    "because stars in the virgo cluster can not be resolved using present ground- and space- based telescopes , the standard microlensing technic can not be used for the stars in the virgo cluster . to make an estimation from the column density of the stars",
    ", we assume that galaxies in the virgo cluster have the same surface density of stars as in the milky way , ( @xmath22 ) . for _ hst _ with a psf size of @xmath23 arcsec in the wfc3 , the number of stars inside the psf would be about @xmath24 @xcite . to detect a microlensing event in a high blended background",
    ", we need a very high magnification event to change the flux of pixels inside the psf . in what following",
    ", we provide a rough estimation from the optical depth and the event rate in terms of the transit time towards m87 . in section 3",
    ", we obtain a precise value of the event rate , based on a monte carlo simulation using _ hst _ observations .",
    "the standard definition of the optical depth is the cumulative fraction of area covered by the einstein ring for all the distances from the observer to the source star @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is einstein radius , @xmath4 is the typical mass of the lens , @xmath27 is the mass density of the lens and @xmath28 is the distance between the observer and lens .",
    "taking m87 as the target galaxy , the column density of stars at the center of this galaxy is much larger than that at the edge of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the threshold for detecting a very high magnification event would depend on the position of the source star in m87 . assuming a spherical model for m87",
    ", we calculate the column density of the stars by integrating the number density of stars along the line of sight , @xmath29 .",
    "then , the number density of stars for a given solid angle would be @xmath30 .",

    "( [ npsf ] ) plots the number of stars inside the psf in terms of separation from the center of the galaxy in arcsec , using the galaxy model in mclaughlin ( 1999 ) .",
    "the threshold impact parameter can be defined according to the blending inside the psf .",
    "because the threshold magnification should be more than the number of stars inside the psf ( i.e. @xmath32 ) , the corresponding threshold for the impact parameter can be defined as @xmath33 .",
