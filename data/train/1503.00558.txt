    "random search processes are ubiquitous in nature @xcite , ranging from the diffusive motion of regulatory molecules searching for their targets in living biological cells @xcite , bacteria and animals searching for food by active motion @xcite , all the way to the spreading of epidemics and pandemics @xcite and computer algorithms in high - dimensional optimization problems @xcite . the fact that the search strategy in these processes is to a large extent random reflects the incapability of the searcher to keep track of his past explorations at least over more than a certain period @xcite . during the years",
    "several different search strategies have been studied in the literature , including brownian motion @xcite , spatio - temporally decoupled lvy flights ( lfs ) @xcite and coupled lvy walks ( lws ) @xcite in which the searcher undergoes large re - allocations with a heavy - tailed length distribution either instantaneously ( lfs ) or with constant speed ( lws ) , as well as intermittent search patterns , in which the searcher combines different types of motion @xcite , for instance , three - dimensional and one - dimensional diffusion @xcite , three - dimensional and two - dimensional diffusion @xcite , or diffusive and ballistic motion @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the search strategy is conventionally quantified via the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) defined as the average time a random searcher needs to arrive at the target for the first time @xcite .",
    "the physical principle underlying an improved search efficiency is an optimized balance between the sampling of space on a scale much larger than the target and on the scale similar to or smaller than the target @xcite .",
    "more specifically , periods of less - compact exploration  for instance , diffusion in higher dimensions , lvy flights , or ballistic motion ",
    "aid towards bringing the searcher faster into the vicinity of the target .",
    "concurrently a searcher in such a less compact search mode may thereby easily overshoot the target @xcite .",
    "in contrast , compact exploration of space ( for instance , diffusion in one dimension ) is superior when it comes to hitting the target from close proximity but performs worse when it comes to the motion on larger scales taking the searcher from its starting position into the target s vicinity : typically frequent returns occur to the same location , a phenomenon referred to as oversampling .",
    "mathematically this is connected to the recurrent nature of such compact random processes .",
    "the idea behind search optimization is to find an optimal balance of both more and less compact search modes in the given physical setting @xcite .",
    "for instance in the so - called facilitated diffusion model for the target search of regulatory proteins on dna@xcite the average duration of non - compact three - dimensional free diffusion is balanced with an optimal compact one - dimensional sliding regime along the dna molecule . in intermittent search @xcite persistent ballistic excursions",
    "are balanced by compact brownian phases .",
    "this optimization principle intuitively works better in lower dimensions , where a searcher performing a standard random walk oversamples the space .",
    "hence , the typically considered optimized strategies have the largest gain in low dimensions .    in a variety of experimental situations the motion of a searcher",
    "is characterized by the same search strategy but is not translationally invariant .",
    "a typical example is a system in which the searcher performs a standard random walk but with a spatially varying rate of making its steps .",
    "this type of motion is actually abundant in biological cells , where experiments revealed a distinct spatial heterogeneity of the protein diffusivity @xcite .",
    "several aspects of such diffusion in heterogeneous media have already been addressed @xcite , but the generic fpt properties remain elusive , in particular , for quenched environments .    here",
    "was ask the question whether spatial heterogeneity is generically detrimental for the efficiency of a random search process or whether it could even be beneficial .",
    "could it even be true that proteins find their targets on the genome in the nucleus faster because their diffusivity landscape in the cell is heterogeneous ?",
    "on the basis of exact results for the mfpt in one , two , and three dimensions in a closed domain under various settings we here show that a spatially heterogeneous search can indeed significantly enhance the rate of arrival at the target .",
    "we explain the physical basis of this acceleration compared to a homogeneous search process and quantify an _ optimal heterogeneity _ , which minimizes the mfpt to the target .",
    "furthermore we show that heterogeneity can be generically beneficial in a random system and is thus a robust means of enhancing the search kinetics .",
    "the optimal heterogeneous search rests on the remarkable observation that the mfpt is completely dominated by those trajectories heading directly towards the target .",
    "we prove that the mfpt for the heterogeneous system can be exactly described with the results of a standard random walk .",
    "we compare our theoretical findings to recent experiments on single particle tracking in living cells , which are indeed in line with the requirements for enhanced search .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii we briefly summarize our main general results , which hold irrespective of the dimension ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ) .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of the most general situation with a specific starting point and position of the interface . in sec .",
    "v we focus on the global mfpt , that is , the mfpt averaged over the initial position .",
    "in section vi we analyze a system with a random position of the interface and optimize the mfpt averaged over the interface position .",
    "in section vii we address the global mfpt in systems with a random position of the interface . throughout",
    "we discuss our results in a biophysical context motivated by recent experimental findings .",
    "finally , we conclude by discussing the implications of our results for more general spatially heterogeneous systems .",
    "we focus on the simplest scenario of a spatially heterogeneous system . even for this minimal model",
    "the analysis turns out to be challenging and our exact results reveal a rich behavior with several a priori surprising features .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric system in dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 with a perfectly absorbing target of radius @xmath3 located in the center ( fig .",
    "[ schm ] ) . the outer boundary at radius @xmath4 is taken",
    "to be perfectly reflecting .",
    "the system consists of two domains with uniform diffusivities denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the interior and exterior domains , respectively .",
    "the interface between these domains is located at @xmath7 .",
    "the microscopic picture we are considering corresponds to the kinetic interpretation of the langevin or corresponding fokker - planck equations .",
    "in particular we assume that the dynamics obey the fluctuation - dissipation relation and in the steady state agree with the results of equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in the biological context we consider that the system is in contact with a heath bath at constant and uniform temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the signaling proteins diffuse in a medium comprising water and numerous other particles , such as other biomacromolecules or cellular organelles .",
    "the remaining particles , which we briefly call crowders , are not uniformly distributed across the cell  their identity and relative concentrations differs within the nucleus and the cytoplasm and can also show variations across the cytoplasm .",
    "the proteins hence experience a spatially varying friction @xmath9 , which originates from spatial variations in the long - range hydrodynamic coupling to the motion of the crowders , which is in turn mediated by the solvent @xcite .",
    "the proteins thus move under the influence of a position dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath10 and a fluctuation - induced thermal drift @xmath11 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the vital role of such hydrodynamic interactions in the cell cytoplasm was demonstrated in @xcite .    because of the spherical symmetry of the problem we can reduce the analysis to the radial coordinate alone .",
    "that is , we only trace the projection of the motion of the searcher onto the radial coordinate ) and therefore start with a discrete space - time nearest neighbor random walk in - between thin concentric spherical shells of equal width @xmath12 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ schm ] . the shell @xmath13 denotes the region between surfaces with radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the hopping rates between shells @xmath16 obey detailed balance    @xmath17    here @xmath18 denotes the probability distribution of finding the particle in shell @xmath13 .",
    "the hopping rates @xmath19 are given as the product of the intrinsic rate @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the probability to jump from shell @xmath13 to shell @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 for jumps in the other direction ) , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the arithmetic mean of the diffusivity in shell @xmath13 .",
    "the rate @xmath21 can be derived as follows .",
    "a random walker located in shell @xmath13 at time @xmath26 can either move to shell @xmath22 with probability @xmath21 or to shell @xmath27 with probability @xmath23 . due to the isotropic motion of the random walker these probabilities are proportional to the respective surface areas of the bounding @xmath28-dimensional spherical surfaces at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "that is , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the proportionality constant",
    "is readily obtained from the normalization condition leading to @xmath31    and thus @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , while the random walker moves in all directions ( radial , azimuthal , or polar ) we can project its motion on the radial coordinate only .",
    "we assume that the interface is located between two concentric shells leading to a continuous steady state probability density profile .",

    "<S> the kinetics of a variety of transport - controlled processes can be reduced to the problem of determining the mean time needed to arrive at a given location for the first time , the so called mean first passage time ( mfpt ) problem . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of occasional large jumps or intermittent patterns combining various types of motion are known to outperform the standard random walk with respect to the mfpt , by reducing oversampling of space . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that a regular but _ spatially heterogeneous _ random walk can significantly and universally enhance the search in any spatial dimension . in a generic minimal model </S>",
    "<S> we consider a spherically symmetric system comprising two concentric regions with piece - wise constant diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> the mfpt is analyzed under the constraint of conserved average dynamics , that is , the spatially averaged diffusivity is kept constant . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical calculations and extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the existence of an _ optimal heterogeneity _ minimizing the mfpt to the target . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the mfpt for a random walk is completely dominated by what we term direct trajectories towards the target and reveal a remarkable universality of the spatially heterogeneous search with respect to target size and system dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to intermittent strategies , which are most profitable in low spatial dimensions , the spatially inhomogeneous search performs best in higher dimensions . discussing our results alongside recent experiments on single particle tracking in living cells </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed spatial heterogeneity may be beneficial for cellular signaling processes . </S>"
