    "in recent years the influence of special and general relativity on quantum information processing has begun to be investigated @xcite .",
    "staying just within the realm of special relativity , one of the natural questions is how lorentz transformations affect the properties of both massive and massless particle states .",
    "the basic approach is through wigner s little group machinery  @xcite as the poincar group is non - compact and thus without any finite - dimensional unitary representations  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the entanglement properties of bipartite states  @xcite composed of massive as well as massless particles have been extensively analyzed . the fundamental impact on entanglement",
    "when the owners of both entangled subsystems are lorentz transformed  @xcite has been recognized since , for physically plausible states , entanglement depends on the properties of the frame where it is measured  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we go back to single - qubit transformations and discuss quantum cloning from the relativistic point of view .",
    "we study how the requirement of lorentz covariance affects the optimality of a cloning protocol .",
    "quantum cloning has come a long way since the discovery of the no - cloning theorem  @xcite and one can find an extensive variety of cloners in two recent review articles  @xcite .",
    "lorentz covariance means that the particular cloning map must be equally effective irrespective of how any input state is rotated or boosted .",
    "more precisely , choosing the fidelity between an input and output state as a figure of merit to measure the quality of the clones , we demand that its value be maximal and independent on the input qubit .",
    "the additional requirement of maximality provides an optimal cloner . as a striking example of",
    "how the relativistic covariance constraint modifies the optimality of the fidelity results , we investigate the state dependent @xmath0 cloner of , generally non - orthogonal , qubits presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the relativistic domain",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between particular particle states for which the effect of the little group generally differ .",
    "photons polarization defines the logical basis of qubits and it is a natural choice due to their use in quantum communication protocols such as bb84 .",
    "there are relatively few previous studies devoted to relativistic effects in either classical or quantum channels . for the classical ones we highlight ref .",
    "@xcite where the channel capacity between two moving observers is studied . for quantum channels , there has been a recent growing interest on quantum information processing in black holes  @xcite as well as on how the unruh effect assists quantum state encryption  @xcite .",
    "as usual , a standard momentum light - like 4-vector @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is chosen .",
    "we can transform this vector into an arbitrary light - like 4-vector @xmath5 by a standard lorentz transformation .",
    "the most general little group element ( stabilizer subgroup which leaves @xmath6 invariant ) is @xmath7  @xcite and consists of rotations and/or translations in a plane , a group which is isomorphic to the euclidean group ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is spanned by vectors with two indices since , together with the angular momentum @xmath9 , the translation operator of the poincar group @xmath10 yields the complete set of commuting operators . in",
    "any given reference frame , a rotation around the direction defined by the standard vector induces a phase on the corresponding state in hilbert space : @xmath11 where for simplicity we took @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the component of the angular momentum in the direction of @xmath14 ( helicity ) . as is well known  @xcite",
    ", massless particles have only integer or semi - integer @xmath13 values and for photons @xmath15 holds .    any other state",
    "is obtained from the reference state @xmath16 by applying a standard lorentz transformation .",
    "thus , if @xmath17 is obtained from @xmath14 by a rotation with longitudinal angle @xmath18 and azimuthal angle @xmath19 , then @xmath20 transforming this state vector by an arbitrary lorentz transformation @xmath21 we arrive at the unitary representation , which turns out to be one - dimensional @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is an angle of the rotation dependent on the lorentz transformation @xmath21 and the initial 4-vector @xmath24 ( the explicit form of @xmath25 can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath26    we suppose that a wave packet is prepared in a state @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a lorentz - invariant measure and @xmath29 is a normalized weight function @xmath30 that describes the superposition of modes with different frequencies but a common direction of propagation @xmath24 .",
    "this selection is made to avoid problems coming from diffraction effects occurring for a general wave packet so that one can not simply define a polarization matrix  , then to keep the validity of the sharp inequality we have to limit the distribution of lorentz boosts .",
    "this restriction does not affect the phase distribution discussed here . ] .",
    "let us examine the action of an arbitrary lorentz transformation on  @xmath31 .",
    "we know  @xcite that the phase angle does not depend on the magnitude of @xmath24 but just on its direction .",
    "so making the transformation  @xmath32 the phase @xmath33 is common for the whole wave packet . considering the choice of our wave packet and also the discussion in  @xcite , after the lorentz transformation and tracing over the momenta degree of freedom ,",
    "we get @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the helicity basis is the logical basis @xmath38 for our qubits ( we thus do not use the lorentz invariant logical basis composed of two physical photons proposed in  @xcite - the task is to clone an unknown single - photon state ) .",
    "for the rest of the article , we assume the following spacetime arrangement . in her reference frame",
    ", alice prepares a state which travels in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "although this direction is well - defined by the outgoing state , for a subject in another inertial reference frame who receives the state ( bob ) it is not sufficient information .",
    "the reason is that there is the whole group of transformations ( rotations around the @xmath24-direction ) which leaves the given light - like vector intact .",
    "this is exactly the rotational part of wigner s little group responsible for inducing the wigner phase @xmath25 in  ( [ unitary_repre ] ) and both angles ( rotation and wigner phase ) coincide  @xcite .",
    "we consider bob s rotation to be completely unknown and uniformly distributed .",
    "let us proceed to analyze how the state - dependent cloning setup investigated by bru  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is affected if relativistic covariance is incorporated .",
    "first , let us remember the original problem and later we formulate how relativistic covariance enters the game",
    ". from now on @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the pauli @xmath41 and @xmath42 matrices .",
    "the original problem solved in  @xcite is , in some sense , an opposite extreme compared to the universal cloner  @xcite , where all possible pure states are distributed according to the haar measure . here , for a fixed @xmath43 , one of just two real states @xmath44",
    "is prepared at random .",
    "the authors solved the problem assuming several reasonable invariance constraints .",
    "the output states were symmetric with respect to the bit flip @xmath45 and were also permutationally invariant . for later comparison with our results , the fidelity function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_clone_pc ] .",
    "the angles of the qubit parametrization are re - scaled to conform the parametrization used here .",
    "now we evaluate ( and later generalize ) the same setup when the relativistic covariance condition is imposed .",
    "( [ wavepacket_transf ] ) describes the effect of lorentz transformation on the photonic states that are considered here . on the bloch sphere",
    ", this transformation becomes @xmath46 .",
    "since our requirement is that the actual angle of the rotation is unknown and uniformly distributed so are the states on the bloch sphere .",
    "hence , in addition to the symmetries described in the previous paragraph , we require the invariance of the output with respect to the operator @xmath47 .",
    "the invariance reflects the ignorance of the rotation angle that induces the phase angle @xmath25 in  eq .",
    "( [ wavepacket_transf ] ) .",
    "let us pause here and describe the physical situation .",
    "we suppose that alice s covariant operation is @xmath45 ( plus some additional operations which we wo nt mention again ) which is combined with another covariant operation @xmath47 induced by the wigner phase @xmath48 ( that is , alice sends one of two possible states which could be transformed by bob s rotation ) so we need to compare the action of @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "the order is important because the operators do not commute .",
    "it can be easily shown that for single qubits , @xmath50 what will prove to be very useful for later calculations .",
    "if we want to go beyond the setup studied in  @xcite and suppose that alice may prepare a general pure qubit in the form @xmath51 we find that @xmath47 and @xmath49 ( our covariant operations ) have a curious behavior since when they are applied to @xmath52 these transformations appear in general as two asymmetric oriented arcs on opposite hemispheres ( parametrized by @xmath25 ) . to get a symmetric relativistic transformation we have to assume a different covariant operation , namely @xmath53 where @xmath54=u\\varrho u^{-1}$ ] is the conjugation operation so we are in an adjoint representation of a group whose members are @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 is the transposition of the density matrix in the standard ( logical ) basis @xmath57 ( because of this transformation we traveled into the adjoint representation ) .",
    "the reason for incorporating @xmath56 becomes evident when we compare the action of @xmath58 and @xmath53 ( our new covariant couple ) on @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", we will make use of the following identity ( see proof in appendix ) @xmath59 note that @xmath60=0 $ ] .",
    "the motivation for introducing the identity is purely computational ( just as for commutator  ( [ covn1 ] ) ) but the physical interpretation is interesting . since @xmath61=0 $ ] holds the order of the covariance operations does not matter .",
    "thus , in the next we will investigate both relativistic covariance effects , i.e. when covariance is required with respect to @xmath62 for real states @xmath63 , and @xmath53 for general states @xmath64 . except where really necessary , we will omit the symbol @xmath65 for the conjugation operation to avoid the excessive notation but we have to remember that we keep working in the adjoint representation .",
    "let us rephrase the invariance requirements from the previous paragraph in an appropriate formalism .",
    "the jamiokowski isomorphism  @xcite between positive operators and cp maps  @xcite is a traditional tool for the calculation of optimal and group covariant completely positive ( cp ) maps .",
    "one appreciates the representation even more by realizing that an implementation of the mentioned transposition operation is particularly easy .",
    "let @xmath66 be a cp map , then the corresponding positive operator @xmath67 is related by @xmath68\\right)r^{(n)}_\\mathcal{m}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath69 denoting the above discussed alternatives ( without and with the transposition , respectively ) and @xmath70 .",
    "the expression @xmath71\\equiv\\varrho^t_{in}$ ] stands for the transposition of the density matrix @xmath72 .",
    "it is important to stress that the case @xmath73 must not be in a contradiction with the definition of the isomorphism ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "consequently , the net effect is that we require @xmath75 to be invariant with respect to the transposition of @xmath72 .    if @xmath66 is a cloning cp  map then using eq .",

    "we get the basic structure of the jamiokowski operator @xmath80 and we apply the bit - flip and the output state symmetry covariance conditions .",

    "this combined requirement is apparently stronger than the universal ( i.e. @xmath107 ) covariance and the reason for the low fidelity values is that the map @xmath75 must be of the same form for both @xmath114 and @xmath115 as a result of  eq .  ( [ jamiolk ] ) .",
    "could this result tell us something about , for instance , the security of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) ? looking at the most studied protocol bb84",
    "@xcite ( of course , implemented by the polarization encoding which is preferred for a free - space communication for which the relativistic effects may be very relevant ) we see that four qubits equidistantly distributed on the meridian are used . for @xmath74 , they form the @xmath116plane of the bloch sphere ( ` real meridian ' ) and for @xmath73 it is an arbitrary grand circle intersecting the north and south pole ( ` complex meridian ' ) . from the viewpoint of an eavesdropper without the knowledge of the wigner phase @xmath25 and decided to clone the quantum states to get some information , we can now demonstrate that not all quadruples are equally good . if the states @xmath117 are used for the qkd purposes then by inserting @xmath118 into  eqs .",
    "( [ fidelanaln1 ] ) and ( [ fidelanaln2 ] ) , we get @xmath119 and @xmath120 . on the other hand , using the quadruple @xmath121 we get the fidelity @xmath122 because by phase - rotating the quadruple states ( that is , applying @xmath47 ) we pass the mutually unbiased states of the bloch sphere .",
    "we see that @xmath123 corresponds to the fact that for @xmath73 the eavesdropper has less information about the input state .",
    "another interesting question is how the relativistic covariance affects the optimality of the universal cloner .",
    "here the situation is different . in the analysis above we combined two covariant operations ( @xmath124 and @xmath47 ) which are not generally subsets of each other . on the other hand , as we saw , every wigner rotation is a @xmath125 covariant rotation and since @xmath126 we may conclude that the optimality of the universal cloner will remain unchanged .",
    "pictorially , it corresponds to the situation where alice sends a completely unknown photon ( @xmath107 covariance ) to bob who , in addition , does not know how the whole bloch sphere rigidly rotates ( his rotation with respect to alice ) .",
    "however , this is again a kind of @xmath107 rotation .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the role played by the requirement of relativistic covariance in the problem of the optimality of one of the most prominent forbidden quantum - mechanical process as quantum cloning . observing that the effect of wigner s little group can be translated into the language of so - called phase - covariant processes we studied how the effectiveness of the cloning process becomes modified .",
    "particularly , we considered an observer in a different reference frame with no knowledge of the parameters of the reference frame where the state designated for cloning was produced .",
    "here we focused on the class of state - dependent cloners where the effect is especially appreciable .",
    "first , as a direct application of the relativistic considerations on the cloning setup studied in  @xcite where one of two real states is prepared in one inertial frame and cloned in another inertial frame whose transformation properties regarding the first one are completely unknown .",
    "second , we went beyond this setup and supposed that in the first frame two general pure qubits related by a common action of the pauli @xmath127 matrix and the density matrix transposition operator might be prepared .",
    "again , we wanted such a state to be cloned in another inertial frame without knowledge of which state was actually sent and how it was relativistically transformed .",
    "in both cases , we brought analytical expressions for local fidelities of the output states asking the fidelity to be maximal and optimal .",
    "one of the intriguing results is that in the second case the fidelity drops even below the universal cloner limit .",
    "the reason is that we combined the mentioned cloning invariance conditions with another forbidden process - finding the orthogonal complement of an unknown state .",
    "note that even without the relativistic context we generalized the previous research on the phase - covariant cloning maps and at the same time we studied optimal covariant processes considering covariance operations which do not commute .",
    "as an example of the consequences for communication security issues we have shown that for an eavesdropper determined to get some information by cloning a bb84 quadruple of states , not all possibilities are equally good and some provide him with more information .",
    "let @xmath128 be invertible linear transformations .",
