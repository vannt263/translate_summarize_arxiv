    "computation of transport coefficients of relativistic systems is of importance in a variety of fields , including relativistic astrophysics , cosmology , and heavy - ion physics .",
    "the kinetic theory based on the boltzmann equation provides an adequate tool for describing transport in these systems in real time in the dilute regime .",
    "it may be systematically extended to denser systems in cases where one can establish a hierarchy of the timescales governing the system .",
    "an alternative to the boltzmann approach is based on the kubo method , in which non - equilibrium processes are regarded as the response of the system to an external perturbation , which can be computed from _",
    "equilibrium _ correlation functions .",
    "this method has the advantage that the transport coefficients can be evaluated by using equilibrium green s functions formulated in imaginary time .    in this paper",
    "we shall adopt the correlation - function method developed by zubarev  @xcite to derive expressions for transport coefficients of strongly magnetized relativistic fluids .",
    "the zubarev method is based on the concept of a non - equilibrium statistical operator , which is a generalization of the equilibrium gibbs statistical operator to non - equilibrium states .",
    "this approach will enable us to obtain kinetic transport coefficients in terms of correlation functions by expanding the operator in terms of small gradients of the thermodynamical parameters .",
    "it is generally assumed that the state of the system can be defined in terms of ( space - time dependent ) fields of temperature , chemical potential , and momentum  a typical parameter set that is sufficient for a complete description of the system .",
    "( the set of _ relevant parameters _ depends in general on the specific problem under consideration . )",
    "the transport coefficients are then obtained from linear perturbations of the non - equilibrium statistical operator around its equilibrium value . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the situation in which the system is in an external abelian gauge field , _ i.e. _ , an electromagnetic field .",
    "the physical motivation for studying relativistic fluids in strong magnetic fields is provided by compact stellar objects ( neutron stars ) .",
    "it is now well established that neutron stars feature magnetic fields of order @xmath0-@xmath1 g on average , with a subclass of neutron stars ( magnetars ) having magnetic fields of order @xmath2-@xmath3 g. although the _ origin _ of such large magnetic fields is not known , one possibility is the conservation of magnetic flux  @xcite under collapse from ordinary stellar dimensions .",
    "alternatively , the field could be generated by a dynamo mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the field strengths @xmath4 g inferred for magnetars  @xcite refer to the surface of a compact star",
    ". the internal fields could be by several orders of magnitude larger .",
    "an upper limit on the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath5  g is set by the virial theorem for a star in gravitational equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "observationally , soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are now identified with magnetars ; these objects have been associated with specific supernova remnants and form a subclass of young strongly magnetized neutron stars which are distinct from ordinary radio pulsars .",
    "the _ equilibrium _ properties of dense matter in strong magnetic fields have been studied intensively since the discovery of magnetars .",
    "these properties include the equation of state of dense nuclear and quark matter  @xcite , neutrino propagation and pulsar kicks , and neutrino emission and cooling  @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamics and non - equilibrium processes in strong fields have not been studied until recently .    in an earlier paper  @xcite , we have developed an anisotropic hydrodynamic theory to describe strongly magnetized strange matter in a compact star .",
    "it was shown that the dissipative processes in matter are completely described in terms of seven viscosity coefficients ( which include five shear viscosities and two bulk viscosities ) , three thermal conductivities , and three coefficients of electrical conductivity .",
    "our model is the relativistic counterpart of the non - relativistic formulation of plasma theory in strong magnetic fields due to braginskii  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the description of the hydrodynamics of strongly magnetized fluids by relating the hydrodynamic equations to certain correlation functions .",
    "the latter can be computed using the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics . among several methods to derive kubo formulas ,",
    "we choose the one based on the idea of non - equilibrium statistical operators ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of this method for non - magnetized fluids . )",
    "thus , compared to other relativistic treatments of magnetohydrodynamics  ( see , _",

    "@xcite ) , our approach relates the transport coefficients entering magnetohydrodynamics to retarded correlation functions of the microscopic theory .",
