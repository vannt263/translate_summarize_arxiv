    "shock heating by radio galaxies is thought to be an important means of transferring energy from active galactic nuclei to their environments , but direct evidence for this process has been difficult to find .",
    "the first example of a shock associated with expanding radio - galaxy lobes was found in the nearest low - power ( fri ) radio galaxy , centaurus a ( kraft et al . 2003 ) , and this remains the only case to date in which a high mach number shock can be seen in direct contact with a radio lobe .",
    "other examples of shocks have been found in clusters , where they are often detached from the radio lobes and always considerably weaker ( e.g. m87 : forman et al .",
    "2005 , cygnus a : wilson et al .",
    "2006 ; hydra a : nulsen et al .",
    "2006 ) ; these results confirm that energy input via shocks is an important mechanism for agn feedback on scales ranging from individual galaxies to galaxy clusters .",
    "it is therefore essential to be able to constrain the physical properties of radio - lobe shocks , and to understand in what circumstances they occur , so as to be able to measure the total energy contribution from radio galaxies to their environments .",
    "the detection of shocked gas in the low - power ( fri ) radio galaxy centaurus a ( kraft et al . 2003 ) , suggests that the early stages of radio - source expansion will have a dramatic effect on the host galaxy ism .",
    "well - studied , large fri sources are not thought to be overpressured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , it is likely that all radio sources go through an early overpressured phase of supersonic expansion , producing shocks , before achieving pressure balance ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "while the highly supersonic phase of expansion must last for only a small fraction of the source s lifetime , the impact on the surrounding gas properties of the shock heating it produces may be dramatic , since the energy input from such a source is a significant fraction of the gravitational energy of the gas : in the case of cen a , the shock - heated gas has a thermal energy of @xmath9 ergs , which is a few tens of percent of that of the ism ( and its kinetic energy is significantly higher ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "low - power fris similar to cen a are expected to be relatively common , and so the shock detection in cen a leads to a prediction that many elliptical galaxies experience the effects of shock heating by supersonically expanding radio lobes .",
    "it is therefore essential to establish whether the shock conditions observed in cen a , which do not agree with standard predictions , are likely to be typical of the effects of young fri sources on their environments .    in this paper",
    "we report the _ chandra _ detection of shocked gas shells surrounding the radio lobes of ngc3801 : this is the second such detection in a nearby radio galaxy .",
    "ngc3801 is a nearby ( @xmath10 ) , isolated e / s0 galaxy , which hosts a small double - lobed radio source of similar morphology to cen a. optically , ngc3801 is disturbed , with a prominent dust lane and secondary dust features , as shown in hst wfpc2 images @xcite .",
    "recent millimeter - wave observations with bima @xcite have revealed the presence of a central rotating molecular gas ring or disk , as well as a gas clump likely to be infalling merger - related material that may be interacting with the radio jet .",
    "these results indicate that ngc3801 has recently undergone a merger ; our _ chandra _ data therefore also provide an opportunity to investigate the relationship between merger activity , agn fuelling and feedback via radio outbursts . since small fri sources like cen a and ngc3801 will be undetectable in the radio beyond @xmath11 with the sensitivity of current instruments , these sources provide one of the few means of obtaining more information about the heating and compression of gas in more distant massive elliptical galaxies , where such radio sources are likely to be present but undetectable .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt a cosmology with @xmath12 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt a luminosity distance fot ngc3801 of 52.6 mpc , obtained by correcting the heliocentric velocity of 3317 ks s@xmath2 @xcite to the cmb frame of reference , which gives an angular scale of 1 arcsec = 0.25 kpc at the distance of ngc3801 .",
    "we observed ngc3801 with _ chandra _ for 60 ks on 2006 april 6 .",
    "the observation was taken in vfaint mode to minimize the background level .",
    "the data were reprocessed from the level 1 events file with ciao 3.3 and caldb 3.2 , including vfaint cleaning .",
    "the latest gain files were applied and the 0.5-pixel randomization removed using standard techniques detailed in the ciao on - line documentation .",
    "in addition to applying the standard good time intervals we carried out gti filtering using the _ analyze_ltcrv _ script , which reduced the total exposure time to 58,886 s.    we produced a 0.5  2 kev filtered image to examine the x - ray emission associated with the radio galaxy , presented in fig .",

    "extraction regions are shown in fig  [ regions ] .",
    "local background regions adjacent to or surrounding the source extraction regions were used .",

    "we assumed a fixed galactic absorption of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite in all of our spectral fitting .",
    "we also extracted a radial surface brightness profile for ngc3801 to constrain the x - ray emission from the ism , masking out the radio lobe regions and point sources , and using an outer annulus ( between 74 and 123 arcsec ) as a local background .",
    "the profile was extracted in the 0.5  2 kev energy range , where the contribution from the nuclear point source is negligible , so that the profile could be fitted by a @xmath17 model convolved with the _ chandra _ psf , as parametrized by worrall et al .",

    "the data were calibrated in the standard manner using aips .",
    "the _ clean _ algorithm was used to map the data for each frequency at each configuration , and in each case self - calibration was carried out to convergence using the clean model components .",
    "the final 1.4-ghz map was obtained by first combining our a - configuration data with an an earlier snapshot observation ( ab920 ) in the same configuration to improve our _ uv _ coverage .",

    "the 4.9-ghz data were reduced similarly , with the c - configuration data first calibrated using the best b - configuration model before they were combined .",
    "the final combined b and c configuration map at 4.9-ghz has resolution matched to the combined a and b configuration map at 1.4-ghz , enabling spectral analysis to be carried out as discussed in section  [ age ] .",
    "although , the edge - brightned shell morphology of the lobe - related emission immediately suggests a hot gas origin , we initially fitted the spectra for the east and west lobe - related x - ray emission with single power - law and _ mekal _ models with the aim of distinguishing between a thermal and non - thermal origin . in neither case",
    "could a single power - law model provide an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "we calculate that the predicted x - ray flux from lobe inverse - compton scattering of cmb and synchrotron photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the 1.4-ghz radio flux and assuming equipartition of energy density in magnetic fields and particles , is at least two orders of magnitude below that observed , so that we would not expect to see significant emission from these processes .",
    "a good fit was obtained for the west lobe region with a _ mekal _",
    "model having @xmath18 kev , assuming @xmath19 solar , giving @xmath20 for 2 d.o.f .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.4 - 2 kev flux from this component is @xmath21 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath2 .",
    "for the eastern lobe we obtained a good fit ( @xmath22 for 3 d.o.f . ) with @xmath23 kev , giving an unabsorbed 0.4 - 2.0 kev flux of @xmath24 ergs @xmath16 .",
    "we carried out a free abundance fit for the west lobe , which did not significantly alter the measured temperature , and for the east lobe ( which had too few bins for a similar test ) we verified that varying the abundance between 0.28 ( the lowest acceptable value ) and 0.5 solar did not significantly affect the temperature , though in both cases the _ mekal _ normalization is affected ( we discuss the effect of this uncertainty on the inferred gas density in section  [ physical ] ) .",
    "we also compared a range of background regions , including a large off source region , and regions on either side of the radio lobes , none of which affected the temperature determination for each lobe .",
    "finally , we tested a combined power - law + mekal model for the west lobe , but obtained a very low power - law normalization and no significant change in temperature or temperature uncertainty .",
    "as stated above , there is no plausible physical origin for non - thermal x - ray emission of this strength associated with the radio lobes , and so we do not consider non - thermal models further .    if the hot gas is due to shocks , it is likely that the shells will have temperature structure , so that a single temperature _ mekal _ model is not ideal . in addition , the dust lane structure of the host galaxy could lead to variable absorption across the eastern shell . unfortunately the photon statistics do not allow us to test for either of these scenarios and so in the discussion that follows we adopt the physical parameters obtained from the single temperature _ mekal _ fits .",
    "our adopted spectral models for the lobe - related x - ray emission are shown in fig .",
    "[ lobespec ] .",
    "we used surface brightness profile analysis to investigate the extended emission from the x - ray halo of ngc3801 , using the 0.4  1 kev energy range and masking point sources to minimize any contamination from the resolved x - ray binary population in this galaxy .",
    "extended emission is detected to a radius of @xmath25 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath26 kpc . as the contribution from the central agn in this energy range is negligible due to its heavy absorption",
    ", we simply fitted a @xmath17 model convolved with the _ chandra _ psf using the model of @xcite .",
    "we obtained best - fitting values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 arcsec ; however , both the slope and core radius are poorly constrained due to the small numbers of counts . the profile and best - fitting model",
    "are shown in fig .  [ profile ] .",
    "the extent of the detected gas halo is comparable to the extent of stellar light detected in the ground - based observations of @xcite , who calculated an effective radius of 11.1 kpc ( transformed to our luminosity distance ) based on the measurements of @xcite ; however , the @xmath29-band surface brightness profile of @xcite shows that the stellar distribution is considerably steeper than that of the hot gas .",
    "we then extracted a spectrum for the region sampled by the radial profile ( excluding the nucleus and lobe regions ) .",
    "a single _ mekal _ model resulted in an implausibly high temperature ; however , there is likely to be a significant contribution from the unresolved x - ray binary population and so we fitted a model consisting of a _ mekal _ plus flat ( @xmath30 ) power - law to account for this component .",
    "a best - fitting temperature of @xmath31 kev was obtained ( for fixed abundance of 0.4 solar , the measured value for centaurus a , kraft et al .",
    "2003 ) resulting in a value of @xmath32 for 4 d.o.f .",
    "[ ismspec ] shows the ism spectrum with this best - fitting model .",
    "the temperature is not sensitive to abundance ; however , the mekal normalisation varies by a factor of @xmath33 if the abundance is varied between 0.l and 1.0 times solar .",
    "we carried out simulations using the _ fakeit _ command in xspec , which demonstrated that we can obtain an unbiased estimate of the temperature for a value of 0.23 kev in the abundance range 0.1 to 1.0 times solar , with a 90 percent confidence range similar to the quoted uncertainties for an abundance of 0.4 times solar .",
    "our fitted temperature is also in reasonable agreement with that inferred from the galaxy velocity dispersion ( see section  [ energy ] ) .",
    "we measured an unabsorbed 0.4 - 7.0 kev flux of @xmath34 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath2 from the thermal component , and a 1-kev flux density of @xmath35 njy from the pl component . modelling the hard component with a thermal bremsstrahlung component of @xmath36 kev ,",
    "as might be expected for a population of low - mass x - ray binaries , does not significantly affect the best - fitting temperature or the luminosity of the _ mekal _ component .",
    "we determined the bolometric x - ray luminosity of the ism , by integrating the best - fitting @xmath17 model and using the best - fitting thermal model to convert from the total number of counts , to be @xmath37 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "since ngc3801 has @xmath38 @xcite , this puts it in the middle of the @xmath39 distribution for elliptical galaxies , as studied by @xcite . for an abundance of 0.4 times solar ,",
    "the central density of the gas is @xmath40 @xmath41 ( ranging from @xmath42 @xmath41 for abundances ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 times solar ) .",
    "we note that the radial distribution of the gas may differ somewhat from the beta model fitted above , since emission from x - ray binaries contributes @xmath43 percent of the flux in the energy range used ; however , our x - ray surface brightness profile is much flatter than the stellar distribution @xcite , so that it is likely to be dominated by the gas emission .",
    "any systematic effect of the x - ray binary contribution must be to reduce the gas density at the radii of interest discussed further in section  [ physical ] .",

    "wavdetect_. the brightest source contains 28 counts in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band . to convert count rate to luminosity , we assume a 5 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum with galactic absorption",
    ". a count rate of 10@xmath46 cts s@xmath2 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band corresponds to a flux of @xmath47 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath2 in the 0.1 - 10.0 kev band ( unabsorbed ) .",
    "the observed rate from the brightest source corresponds to a luminosity of 1.4@xmath4810@xmath49 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "based on the log(n)-log(s ) relation of tozzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we expect @xmath500.5 background agn of this flux or higher within the @xmath45 radius .",
    "there are eight other sources detected in the @xmath45 radius with fluxes a factor of 3 to 7 lower than the brightest source .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the brightest source does not qualify it as a ulx if it is related to ngc 3801 , and there is a significant probability that it is an unrelated background agn .",
    "some of the less luminous sources are likely to be lmxbs related to the host galaxy at the high end of the luminosity function , none of which are ulxs .",
    "we conclude that none of the point sources are ulxs .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of ngc3801 was poorly fitted with a single power - law model with galactic absorption ( @xmath51 ) : extremely prominent residuals are present at hard energies .",
    "we therefore added a second model component consisting of a heavily absorbed power law , which resulted in a good fit .",
    "a similar two power - law model was found to provide the best description of the nuclear spectrum of centaurus a ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is commonly used to fit spectra of narrow - line radio galaxies",
    ".    the power - law index of the unabsorbed component is poorly constrained , and so we fixed its value at @xmath52 ( a typical value for unabsorbed power law components in fri radio galaxies , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best fitting values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the second component were @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath16 , respectively , giving @xmath57 for 5 d.o.f .",
    "we then fixed the second power - law index at the more physically plausible value of 1.5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gave a best - fitting value of @xmath58 @xmath16 and @xmath59 for 6 d.o.f .",
    "this best - fitting model is shown in fig .",
    "the unabsorbed 1-kev flux densities in this model were @xmath60 njy and @xmath61 njy for the first and second power - law components , respectively , corresponding to an unabsorbed bolometric luminosity from the obscured component of @xmath62 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the 5-ghz flux density of the core is 3.5 mjy , which means that the primary ( unabsorbed ) power law component lies close to the radio - x - ray core correlation for components with low intrinsic absorption reported by @xcite , whereas the second ( absorbed ) power law lies significantly above the correlation , as is generally the case for heavily absorbed components .",
    "we therefore interpret the primary power law as jet - related in origin , and the second , heavily absorbed power law as having an accretion - related origin .",
    "we used archive hst data ( taken using the f555w and f814w filters on wfpc2 ) to measure the extinction from the central dust lane , which was converted to @xmath63 and subsequently column density of neutral hydrogen using the relations of @xcite .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath64 @xmath16 , which is significantly lower than the column density obtained from our spectral fit , so that we conclude that , in addition to the absorption from the dust lane , the ngc3801 must contain a substantial quantity of absorbing material instrinsic to the nucleus .",
    "heavily absorbed nuclear spectra are not usually found in fri radio galaxies ( e.g. evans et al . 2005 ) ; but centaurus a is an exception , and it would appear that ngc3801 is a second example of an fri radio galaxy with a nucleus having high intrinsic absorption .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result further in section  [ hostgal ] .",
    "we can use our two - frequency radio data to give us some constraints on the age of the radio source .",
    "the two - point spectral indices between 1.4 and 4.9 ghz in the outer regions of the source are only marginally steeper than those in the inner regions , as expected if the radio source is young .",
    "we fitted a jaffe & perola ( 1973 ) aged electron spectrum to the radio data in the outer regions of the source , assuming a constant ageing magnetic field of 2 nt ( the mean equipartition field in the lobes ) .",
    "the main uncertainty in this model is the value of the low - frequency electron energy index ( the ` injection index ' ) .",
    "young et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently argued that in normal fri sources the low - energy electron energy index tends to be close to 2.1 ( @xmath65 , where we define @xmath66 in the sense that @xmath67 ) .",
    "if we adopt this injection index then the spectral index in the steepest part of the lobe ( @xmath68 ) corresponds to a source age of @xmath69 years .",
    "if the injection index were steeper , the age would be reduced : for example , for an injection index corresponding to @xmath70 , which is the flattest spectrum we observe in the jets , we fit an age of @xmath71 years .",
    "it is probably reasonable to treat the age of @xmath72 years as an upper limit .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the age we obtain from source dynamical arguments in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "the spectral analysis presented in section  [ lobes ] revealed that the lobe - related thermal emission is significantly hotter than the surrounding ism gas for both lobes . in this section",
    "we therefore investigate further the plausibility of a model in which we are observing shock - heated shells of gas around the radio lobes of ngc3801 .",
    "we calculated the density and pressure of the gas in each shell region by assuming a spherical shell of gas with an outer radius defined by the outer edge of the detected x - ray emission ( @xmath73 arcsec for both lobes ) .",
    "we assume that the radio source is close to the plane of the sky , as suggested by das et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on the two - sidedness of the jet and the orientation of the nuclear disk , and so we used projected distances to calculate the shell volume ( if the source were at 45 degrees to the angle of sight , we would be underestimating the shell volumes by roughly a factor of 2 ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the thickness of the shells accurately , because the photon statistics are poor , and so we chose conservative upper and lower limits based on the apparent thickness of the emission in the _ chandra _ data ( corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath74 pc ) , and the modelled thickness obtained for the shell in centaurus a where the data quality is sufficient to allow a more accurate determination ( corresponding to @xmath75 pc ) .",
    "the gas densities and pressures in the shells were then determined from the best - fitting _ mekal _ models for each lobe , and are given in table  [ properties ] as a range based on the two volume estimates .",
    "the uncertainty due to the volume completely dominates over the statistical uncertainties on gas temperature and abundance .",
    "the structure of the shells appears clumpy in the x - ray images ; however , there are too few counts to be able to determine adequately constrained physical properties for sub - regions of the shells .",
    "it is necessary to bear in mind in the discussion that follows that the density and pressure values we use for the shells are average values : the distribution of x - ray counts suggests that the surface brightness and hence the gas density in the shells is higher towards the centre of the radio source .",
    "we note that the contribution of x - ray binary emission to the surface brightness profile ( fig .  [ profile ] ) is unlikely to affect significantly our inferred densities , and any small effect",
    "will be in the direction of reducing the ism density .",
    "the conclusions of section  [ dynamics ] are therefore unaffected .    since the external gas density and pressure in the environment of the radio source varies around the edge of the shells , we calculated the external density and pressure at several locations around the edge of the shells .",
    "table  [ properties ] lists these properties at a distance of 10 arcsec from the nucleus of ngc3801 , which roughly corresponds to the midpoint of each shell .",
    "the uncertainty on the ism density is dominated by including a systematic uncertainty due to the unconstrained metal abundance . in section  [ dynamics ] , we consider how the variation of shell and ism properties may affect our results .",
    "we also calculated the equipartition minimum internal pressure of the radio lobes , using measurements of the 1.4-ghz flux density for each lobe to normalize the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we assumed a broken power - law electron distribution with initial electron energy index , @xmath76 , of 2.1 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and a break at @xmath79 , and modelled the lobes as spheres having volumes of @xmath80 pc@xmath81 and @xmath82 pc@xmath81 for the west and east lobes , respectively .",
    "the resulting pressures are given in table  [ properties ] .",
    "the mass in each shell was also calculated in order to compare with the mass expected to have been swept - up by the expanding radio lobes .",
    "we obtained a mass of @xmath83 m@xmath84 for the west shell and @xmath85 m@xmath84 for the east shell .",
    "the ism mass swept up was calculated by modelling the radio lobes as expanding cones of 45@xmath86 half - opening angle and integrating the best - fitting gas density distribution out to a distance of 2.1 kpc , which gives a total mass of @xmath87 m@xmath84 , in fairly good agreement with the total shell mass .",
    "these calculations are therefore consistent with a scenario in which the shells consist of compressed material from the regions of the ism through which the radio source has passed .      as shown in table  [ properties ] , the pressures in the hot shells of gas are higher than the minimum internal pressure of the radio lobes ; since the shells and radio lobes must be in pressure balance , this suggests that the true radio lobe pressure is a factor of @xmath88 times the minimum value . such a departure from minimum energy",
    "is generally observed in fri radio galaxies for which external pressures can be measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is also seen in the inner lobes of centaurus a ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc3801 is one of the few known fri radio galaxies for which the _ minimum _ internal pressure is higher than the external pressure in the ism ( see table  [ properties ] ) ; this is also the case for cen a , and was one of the reasons we selected ngc3801 as a _",
    "chandra _ target .",
    "the pressure in the x - ray shells of ngc3801 ( and by inference the true pressure in the radio lobes ) is more than an order of magnitude higher than the local pressure in the interstellar medium .",
    "the density contrast between the x - ray shells and the surrounding , undisturbed gas is slightly higher , but consistent with a value of @xmath3 for both the east and west shells , using the average shell density determined from the shell spectra , and the external gas density roughly halfway along the shells .",
    "this is the value expected if we are observing a strong shock for which the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions hold .    if we compare our value for the mean shell density with the external density at a distance of 5 arcsec , corresponding to the inner parts of the shells , the density contrast is @xmath89",
    "; however , as shown in figs .",
    "[ data ] and  [ overlay ] , the brightest parts of the shell are in this region , so that the shell densities will be significantly higher than the mean value .",
    "the true density constrast in these inner regions is likely to be consistent with the expected value .",
    "the outer regions of the shell are fainter , so that the shell density is likely to be lower here .",
    "we conclude that it is plausible that the density contrast is in agreement with the value of 4 expected for a strong shock around the entire perimeter of the shells .",
    "since the shell pressure should correspond to the internal radio lobe pressure , it should be uniform .",
    "this implies that the shell temperature at its outer edge should be considerably higher than the mean temperature in order to compensate for the lower gas density . assuming a density contrast of 4",
    ", we calculate a temperature of @xmath90 kev for the outer edge of the shell .",
    "the contribution of x - ray emission from this hotter region is not expected to be significant due to the lower density .    assuming a density contrast of 4",
    ", we can use the rankine - hugoniot conditions to estimate the mach number of the shock , as follows ( landau & lifshitz 1990 ) : @xmath91 which gives mach numbers of @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the west and east shells respectively .",
    "the measured temperature increases are therefore consistent with the interpretation of both shells as originating in the boundary layer of a strong shock .",
    "we also used a simple ram pressure balance calculation as a second means of estimating the shock advance speed as follows ( using a density constrast of 4 , consistent with the observed gas properties of the shell and ism ) : @xmath94 this leads to the following expression for @xmath95 , the mach number of the expanding shocked shell : @xmath96 which corresponds to @xmath97 in the range @xmath98 for the west shell and in the range @xmath99 for the east shell , taking into account the uncertainty in the shell volume and the uncertainty in the ism density due to the unconstrained abundance .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the values obtained from the measured temperature jump .",
    "we conclude that we have indeed detected shells of strongly shocked gas around both radio lobes of ngc3801 , with mach numbers of @xmath100 , and shock conditions roughly consistent with the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ) .",
    "if we assume that the radio source has expanded at @xmath101 throughout its lifetime , this gives a source age of @xmath102 years , which is in good agreement with the upper limit estimated from spectral ageing in section  [ age ] .",
    "the sound speed in the ism is @xmath103 m s@xmath2 , so that a mach number of 4 corresponds to a lobe expansion speed of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "there are a number of differences between the results we obtain for ngc3801 and the shell in cen a ( kraft et al .",
    "firstly , the shell morphologies are different : in cen a , only one shell is detected ( although there may be some much fainter shell - like emission associated with the north - eastern lobe ) .",
    "in addition , the shell in cen a is brightest at the outer edge of the radio lobe , whereas the ngc3801 shells are brightest in the regions towards the nucleus .",
    "if lobe expansion is supersonic everywhere , the expansion of a uniform pressure radio lobe in an isothermal @xmath17-model atmosphere should mean that the shock is weakest close to the nucleus ; however , the higher density of the ism in this region means that after compression its x - ray emission would nevertheless be expected to dominate .",
    "it is not clear why this is not observed in cen a.      the total thermal energy stored in the detected hot gas shells is calculated to be @xmath104 ergs and @xmath105 ergs for the west and east shells , respectively , or @xmath106 ergs in total . assuming a mach number of 4 , the kinetic energy of the shells is @xmath107 ergs per shell .",
    "therefore , the total energy stored in the shocked shells is ( @xmath108 ergs .",
    "this is good agreement with the total work available from the radio lobes ( assuming that the true internal lobe pressure is that of the shocked shells ) , @xmath109 ergs .",
    "we calculate that the energy required to inflate both lobe cavities is @xmath110 ergs , a factor of @xmath6 lower than the energy stored in the shells .",
    "shock heating is therefore the dominant energy transfer mechanism during this stage of the radio source s evolution . using the best - fitting gas density distribution",
    ", we find that this corresponds to the total thermal energy in the ism within @xmath5 kpc ( and roughly 25 percent of the total thermal energy within 30 kpc ) .",
    "the radio - source shock heating detected in ngc3801 is therefore having a significant energetic impact on the host galaxy s ism , and may provide enough energy to heat the gas sufficiently for the entire ism to be expelled from the galaxy .",
    "we note that in addition , the internal energy of the radio source ( @xmath111 ergs ) must eventually be transferred to the environment , although over a much longer timescale , and possibly at much larger distances .    assuming a source age of @xmath112 years ( section  [ age ] )",
    ", this means that the radio source is putting work into the ism at a rate of @xmath113 ergs s@xmath2 , which should correspond to a significant fraction of the jet power .",
    "this is a plausible value , given that the most powerful fri jets such as that in 3c31 have jet powers of @xmath114 ergs s@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our measurements of jet impact have therefore provided an independent means of estimating radio - jet power , which supports the more general validity of using jet - power arguments to estimate the energy input from radio galaxies into their environments .",
    "the rate of mechanical work that we calculate is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosity of the obscured nuclear component ( section  [ cores ] ) , so that the agn must be more efficiently converting energy into jet production than into radiation .    to investigate the relationship between this energy output and accretion on the central black hole",
    ", we used the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath115 km s@xmath2 , @xcite ) to estimate a black hole mass of @xmath116 , using the relation of @xcite .",
    "assuming an efficiency of @xmath117 , the energy output we have measured from the radio source and shocked gas shells would require a total accreted mass of @xmath118 m@xmath84 , or an accretion rate of @xmath119 m@xmath84 yr@xmath2 , given the source age estimate above . for comparison",
    ", we calculate a bondi accretion rate of @xmath120 m@xmath84 yr@xmath2 from the central hot gas , which suggests that bondi accretion could be sufficient to provide the energy observed to be being transferred to the ism from the central agn by the radio lobes if the efficiency is relatively high ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the bright shells discussed in the previous sections , the _ chandra _ data also reveals a linear feature on scales of 10  20 kpc ( shown in the 0.4  1 kev image of fig .",
    "[ streak ] ) , which appears to be well - aligned with the inner radio jet axis .",
    "this feature has an extremely soft spectrum , well - fitted by a power law of photon index @xmath121 .",
    "the spectrum can not be fitted by a thermal model with @xmath122 kev .",
    "there is no radio emission associated with this feature , nor does it appear to be associated with any optical or emission - line features .",
    "although it has a similar orientation to one of the dust lanes , their position angles differ by @xmath123 degrees .",
    "the x - ray feature is not aligned with the chip axis , so that it is unlikely to be an instrumental artefact .",
    "we believe that the most plausible origin for this soft x - ray emission is a tidal or ram - pressure stripped tail , related to the merging / interactions of ngc3801 with other nearby galaxies , including ngc3802 to the north .",
    "the x - ray emission is therefore likely to be thermal emission from cooler , dense material stripped from the ism of galaxies interacting with ngc3801 .",
    "such emission could mimic the steep power - law spectrum we observe .",
    "it could be argued that the presence of x - ray features produced by tidal debris might suggest a tidal origin for the features coincident with the radio lobes .",
    "it is not possible to rule out such a model definitively ; however , the strong morphological agreement between radio and x - ray structure , the significant differences in the spectral properties of the shell features and tidal tails , and the fact that we know the radio lobes to be overpressured and hence supersonically expanding , all support our interpretation of the radio - related x - ray emission as shocked gas .",
    "both cen a and ngc3801 possess strong evidence for a recent merger with a gas - rich galaxy , which may be more typical of frii host galaxies compared to the hosts of more powerful fris ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the relationship between their merger history , radio outbursts , and their effects on the ism as revealed by _",
    "chandra_. ngc3801 and cen a have another feature in common , which may be related to their merger history : they are the only two fri radio galaxies that we know of whose nuclear spectra require the presence of a high absorbing column ( @xmath124 ) , so that they are the only known fris that possess any evidence for the torus often found in powerful , high - excitation ( frii ) radio galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "although we can not draw strong conclusions from two objects , it is interesting to speculate that these two sources may be fuelled in the same way as frii radio galaxies .",
    "it is possible that these two radio galaxies represent a class of post - merger system in which cold gas is driven into the inner regions to fuel the central agn and trigger a radio outburst . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of fainter larger - scale radio structure surrounding the inner lobes of cen a means that in that case at least , the young central radio source does not represent the first or only radio outburst .",
    "our radio data show no evidence for previous generations of radio activity in ngc3801 .",
    "radio - loud agn that are fuelled by the accretion of cold gas from recent merger events are not self - regulating in the same way as agn fuelled by direct accretion of the hot phase of the ism ( e.g. by bondi accretion : @xcite ) , since the agn impact on the hot phase does not affect the accretion rate of cold material . in these systems , therefore , the long - term effects of agn energy input may be particularly extreme .",
    "we have detected shells of shocked gas surrounding both radio lobes of ngc3801 .",
    "we infer mach numbers of @xmath125 for the shock advance speeds , so that our results correspond to the second detection of strong shocks associated with a low - power radio galaxy .",
    "the total energy stored in the shock - heated shells represents a large fraction of the total thermal energy of the host galaxy , so that the long - term effects of the ngc3801 outburst are likely to be dramatic .",
    "this is the first case where the total energetic impact of a radio galaxy on its environment can be directly measured , and suggests that the energetic contribution of an early supersonic phase is likely to be important in low - power radio galaxies .",
    "the energy stored in the shocked gas is 25 times the @xmath126 work required to inflate the radio - lobe cavities , so that during this phase of its evolution , shock heating is the dominant mechanism of energy transfer from ngc3801 to its environment .",
