    "peculiar velocities play an important role in understanding the large - scale gravitational field in the universe and have been the subject of intense investigations over the past decades .",
    "early determinations of peculiar velocities were based on surveys of individual galaxies ( see review by strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "first measurements by rubin and co - workers found peculiar flows of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ( rubin et al 1976 ) , but were largely dismissed at the time .",
    "a group collectively known as the  seven samurai \" found that elliptical galaxies within @xmath2mpc were streaming at @xmath3 km s@xmath1 with respect to the cmb ( dressler et al 1987 , lynden - bell et al 1988 ) . using mainly spiral galaxies , mathewson et al ( 1992 ) found that this flow does not converge until scales much larger than @xmath4 mpc , in agreement with the results of a later analysis by willick ( 1999 ) .",
    "with brightest cluster galaxies as distance indicators for a sample of 119 rich clusters , lauer & postman ( 1994 - lp ) measured a bulk flow of @xmath5700 km s@xmath1 on a scale of @xmath6mpc .",
    "an improved re - analysis of these data by hudson & ebeling ( 1997 ) , however , found a reduced bulk flow pointing in a different direction . using early - type galaxies in 56 clusters ,",
    "hudson et al ( 1999 ) found a similar bulk flow as lp and on a comparable scale , but again in a different direction .",
    "by contrast , a sample of 24 snia by riess et al ( 1997 ) showed no evidence of significant bulk flows out to @xmath7 mpc , and a similar conclusion was reached in a study of spiral galaxies by courteau et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "a complementary technique aimed at constraining bulk motions reconstructs directly the peculiar gravity of the observed galaxy distribution and uses measurements of the dipole in the distributions of light and matter .",
    "the dipole derived from the distribution of galaxies mapped in optical surveys is nearly aligned with the one obtained for infra - red - selected galaxies , but both are misaligned with respect to the cmb dipole generated by the motion of our local group relative to the cmb rest frame ( rowan - robinson et al 2000 ) , although this misalignment becomes less troublesome if one relaxes the light - tracing - mass assumptions ( see discussion by gunn 1988 ) .",
    "kocevski et al ( 2004 ) and kocevski & ebeling ( 2006 ) measured the dipole anisotropy of an all - sky sample of x - ray - selected galaxy clusters to probe mass concentrations beyond the great attractor and found that most of the peculiar velocity of the local group is due to overdensities at @xmath8mpc .",
    "all galaxy techniques lose sensitivity at distances approaching and greater than @xmath950 - 100 mpc .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , produced by hot gas in galaxy clusters , is uniquely suited to probe flows to larger distances ; moreover , it is independent of redshift and not subject to the systematics plaguing studies using empirical distance indicators .",
    "the kinematic part of the sz effect ( ksz ) is directly proportional to the cluster velocity with respect to the cosmic micorwave background ( cmb ) . because of its smallness",
    ", the ksz effect has , however , not yet been measured for individual clusters ; observations of six clusters at a wide range of redshifts out to @xmath10 yielded an upper limit of @xmath11 km s@xmath1 on a poorly defined scale ( benson et al 2003 ) .",
    "kashlinsky & atrio - barandela ( 2000 , hereafter ka - b ) have proposed a method to measure large - scale flows using all - sky cluster catalog and cmb all - sky data , such as obtained with wmap .",
    "ka - b identified a statistic ( the dipole of the cmb temperature field evaluated at cluster positions ) which preserves the ksz component while integrating down other ( noise ) terms .",
    "however , the method requires a cmb filter that removes the primary cmb ( which is strongly spatially correlated ) without significantly attenuating the ksz bulk flow contribution ; clearly not every filter will achieve this .",
    "kashlinsky et al ( 2008 , 2009 - kabke1,2 ) have applied the ka - b method to a large cluster catalog finding a surprising flow ( dubbed the `` dark flow '' ) extending to at least 300@xmath12mpc . following this ,",
    "an independent study of watkins et al ( 2010 ) combined the available galaxy data suppressing the sampling noise in the various surveys and showed that all data ( with the exception of the lp sample ) agreed with a substantial motion on a scale of @xmath13mpc with amplitude and direction in good agreement with the kabke measurements . in a follow - up study ,",
    "kashlinsky et al ( 2010 , kaeek ) revise the statistical analysis of their original study and use a much expanded cluster catalog , binned by cluster x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14 ) to demonstrate that the cmb dipole increases with the @xmath14-threshold as required by the ksz origin of the signal ; such an @xmath14 dependence of the dipole is inconsistent with it originating from some putative systematic effect from primary cmb fluctuations .",
    "kaeek find that the `` dark flow '' flow extends to at least @xmath15 mpc , twice the distance reported by kabke .",
    "atrio - barandela et al ( 2010 , akeke ) , developed a formalism to understand  both analytically and numerically  the uncertainties in measurements using the kabke filter ; the same formalism is applicable to any filtering scheme . in addition ,",
    "akeke demonstrate that the kabke filter removes primary cmb fluctuations down to the fundamental limit of cosmic variance , rendering it optimal for such studies .",
    "very recently , the dark flow results of kabke / kaeek have found support by a study ( ma et al 2010 ) using a compilation of galaxy distance indicators which reports the same `` tilt '' velocity as the dark flow and pointing in the same direction , within the calibration uncertainties discussed in kabke2/kaeek / akeke . on the other hand ,",
    "the kabke results have been challenged by keisler ( 2009 ) . replicating the analysis of kabke1,2 using a cluster catalog compiled from publicly available data , keisler confirmed the central dipole values measured by kabke2 , but claimed that it has only marginal statistical significance .",
    "akeke ( sec .  4 and fig .  5 )",
    "have since shown that keisler s error estimates are erroneous , whereas keisler claimed a @xmath16 increase . ] and largely due to him not having removed the monopole and dipole from the cmb maps _ outside _ the mask . in a more recent challenge osborne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have likewise used publicly available x - ray cluster data , applied alternative filtering schemes and claimed not to be able to replicate the `` dark flow '' results .",
    "in this study we construct the cluster catalog from public data available to keisler ( 2009 ) and osborne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and demonstrate that , with the filtering scheme developed by us earlier , application of the ka - b method yields a statistically significant cmb dipole which is perfectly consistent with the kaeek results .",
    "we further address the calibration uncertainties in such a measurement to demonstrate that the data very likely require a sign change of the ksz term from filtering as explained in kaeek , an uncertainty we hope to eliminate with the proper calibration of our future catalog and our planned application to the upcoming planck data as was proposed by us earlier[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "the cmb temperature field in the presence of a bulk flow can be written as : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the instrument noise , and the last term represents the contribution to the dipole caused by the ksz signal from any bulk flow .",
    "we want to measure the ksz amplitude , @xmath19 , whose value is in general quite small compared to the tsz and ( primary ) cmb terms .",
    "ka - b suggested to boost the weight of the ksz term by measuring the dipole of the cmb maps at all - sky cluster positions .",
    "because the primary cmb is spatially highly correlated , a filter needs to be designed that removes this component without significantly attenuating @xmath20 ; clearly not every filter will achieve this .",
    "kabke1,2 defined a filter , described in detail in kabke2 and akeke , which belongs to a wiener variety and removes the primary cmb fluctuations from the concordance @xmath21cdm model by minimizing the mean squared deviation of the cmb measurements from noise , @xmath22 .",
    "in multipole @xmath23-space it is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the power spectra of the cmb map and the theoretical model convolved with the beam , respectively .",
    "akeke develop a formalism to quantify the errors in the resultant dipole determination that can be applied to _ any _ filtering scheme and show that the kabke filter removes the primary cmb fluctuations down to the fundamental limit of the cosmic variance .",
    "the filtering does , however , not remove the tsz component and is thus by itself insufficient to isolate the ksz contribution .",
    "atrio - barandela et al ( 2008 , herafter akke ) helped critically to overcome this issue by demonstrating explictily , with wmap data , that clusters are well described by the nfw profile ( navarro et al 1996 ) and that their x - ray temperature , @xmath26 , should then decrease toward cluster outer parts .",
    "kabke1,2 used this property , after further empirical tests , to suppress the tsz contribution by measuring the cmb dipole at cluster positions over larger apertures , evaluating the final dipole at _",
    "zero monopole_. the latter also insures that the tsz contribution to the dipole measured at the final aperture is small .    in order to isolate the ksz dipole kabke and kaeek , as well as this study ,",
    "proceed as follows : 1 ) we first filter separately each of the foreground - subtracted wmap maps with a filter that removes the primary cmb fluctuations from @xmath21cdm , 2 ) we identify , in the filtered maps and for each cluster configuration , the aperture where the monopole over the cluster pixels vanishes ( along with the tsz contribution to the dipole ) , 3 ) we establish , by measuring the dipole separately for clusters binned by @xmath27 and @xmath14 , that the signal originates from the ksz term .",
    "the last step is particularly important to test for the presence of systematic effects since these are not likely to correlate with either the redshift or the x - ray luminosity of the clusters in the sample .",
    "the original foreground - reduced cmb maps had their monopole and dipole subtracted outside the galactic mask .",
    "the maps are pixelized in the healpix format with @xmath28 ( gorski et al 2005 ) .",
    "an extra step in our pipeline described in kaeek is the additional subtraction of the quadrupole from the maps outside the galactic mask prior to filtering .",
    "this probes the possible leakage of a quadrupole signal due to masking effects , and also removes any relativistic contribution from the local velocity , @xmath29 , down to @xmath30 $ ] terms of the octupole .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] illustrates the properties of the filtered maps .",
    "there is no particular structure in @xmath23-space over any range of multipoles up to the scales subtending cluster apertures ( @xmath31 radius ) .    to understand the measurability of the ksz dipole from _ filtered _",
    "7-yr wmap data it is instructive to estimate the uncertainties expected in a given filtering scheme .",
    "akeke developed analytical and numerical formalism which we briefly revisit below .",
    "the standard deviation of _ any _ filtered map is given by eq . 3 of akeke",
    ": @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the power spectrum of the original map containing the @xmath21cdm primary signal ( convolved with the beam ) and instrument noise , @xmath34 .",
    "the uncertainty in measuring the monopole and three dipole terms from such maps is then @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "equation [ eq : sigma_fil ] can be applied to _ any _ filtering scheme and is the key to estimating the uncertainties of the eventual measurement using the ka - b methodology .",
    "the variance of the filtered maps , @xmath37 , contains two terms adding in quadrature such that @xmath38 with 1 ) @xmath39 from the residual primary cmb anisotropies and 2 ) @xmath40 from the instrument noise .",
    "the first of these gives rise to uncertainty which integrates down as @xmath41 independently of the integration time and the number of pixels ( fixed by the aperture size ) , @xmath42 , involved in the final measurement , while uncertainty due to the second term integrates down as @xmath43 .",
    "akeke demonstrate that for the kabke filtering scheme the filtering removes primary cmb down to the cosmic variance limit and the contribution from primary cmb becomes @xmath44k .",
    "we use the wmap data pixelized with @xmath45 pixels , so the number of pixels subtended by a given aperture of radius @xmath46 is @xmath47",
    ". we will use below the four ( @xmath48 ) w - band da s which have the best angular resolution with the instrument noise per pixel of about @xmath49k after 7-yr integrations ( jarosik et al 2011 ) .",
    "thus for the combined 7-yr w - band cmb data one obtains @xmath50k . when added in quadrature to @xmath39 this term - for 7-year wmap data and the final cluster apertures - gives a negligible contribution ( @xmath51 ) to the overall error budget .",
    "we note that filtering can not produce a dipole associated exclusively with clusters and whose magnitude further appears at zero monopole and increases with the cluster luminosity threshold .",
    "however , inappropriate filtering can decrease the s / n of the measured dipole rendering the measurement impossible . in this context",
    "it is worth pointing that osborne et al use two filters designed to isolate and remove radio sources .",
    "their fig .",
    "12 shows that their best filter does not recover bulk velocities with amplitude @xmath52 km / s , while their other filter requires velocities of 30,000 km / sec or higher to be useful .",
    "however , massive coma - like clusters moving at such speeds would generate ksz anisotropies of @xmath53k that would be detectable in the _ unfiltered _ maps , while in the maps filtered with the osborne et al adopted filters they are not .",
    "this by itself questions the suitability of the adopted filtering schemes in the ka - b method .",
    "our filter was designed to remove the primary cmb component , the main contaminant on any ksz measurement ( see k - ab ) , and it does it down to cosmic variance ( akeke , fig .",
    "filters suited to detect point sources or to remove the tsz component could remove the cmb on large scales but boost it on small scales , reducing the s / n measurement of the ksz dipole at cluster locations . in any case , the formalism described in akeke and above ( eq . [ eq : sigma_fil ] ) enables to determine the efficiency of any filter . in this sense",
    "our filter is close to optimal because the primary cmb is removed down to the fundamental limit imposed by cosmic variance .      to facilitate independent tests of the intermediate results of our data processing pipeline as well as of our final results concerning the presence and properties of the dark flow , we here provide step - by - step instructions on how to compile a basic version of the cluster catalogue used by kabke .",
    "the resulting cluster sample should be nearly identical to the ones used by keisler ( 2009 ) and osborne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their independent analyses of wmap data .",
    "the three publicly available catalogues of x - ray selected clusters compiled from rosat all - sky survey data ( rass , voges et al .",
    "1999 ) are the extended bcs sample ( ebeling et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) in the northern equatorial hemisphere , the reflex sample ( bhringer et al .  2004 ) in the southern equatorial hemisphere , and the ciza sample ( ebeling , mullis & tully 2002 ; kocevski et al .",
    "2007 ) in the regions of low galactic latitude ( @xmath54 ) excluded from both of the first two samples .",
    "all data contained in these catalogues can be obtained in electronic form at    ` http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/vizier?-source=j/mnras/301/881/ ` ( 206 clusters ) + ` http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/vizier?-source=j/mnras/318/333/ ` ( 99 clusters ) + ` http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/vizier?-source=j/a+a/425/367/ ` ( 447 clusters ) + ` http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/vizier?-source=j/apj/580/774/ ` ( 73 clusters ) + ` http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/vizier?-source=j/apj/662/224 ` ( 57 clusters )    since all three cluster surveys used the same cosmology ( einstein - desitter , @xmath55 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) , the listed data sets can be immediately merged , yielding a combined all - sky catalogue of 882 clusters .",
    "removal of duplicates , caused by overlap between the reflex and ebcs catalogues at @xmath56 leaves a sample of 771 unique clusters outside the kp0 cmb mask .",
    "we note that , while this sample is adequate to test the dark flow results , it is inferior to the one used by us in several respects :    homogeneity and completeness : : :    the x - ray flux limits of the ebcs , reflex , and ciza samples differ    significantly , as does the completeness as a function of redshift of    the three surveys .",
    "the resulting systematic inhomogeneities of the    combined sample are amplified by the fact that the three surveys    employ different algorithms to compute total cluster fluxes ( and hence    also luminosities ) . by contrast , kabke ( and all subsequent studies by    our team ) use a homogenized catalogue created by applying a global    flux limit to cluster fluxes recomputed from the rass raw data ( see    kabke for details ) . contamination : : :    the published catalogues contain entries that have since been    identified as erroneous .",
    "for instance , 99% of the x - ray flux of the    reflex cluster rxc j0334.95342 are contributed by an agn , as revealed    in a pointed x - ray observation with the chandra observatory . the    inclusion of objects that are x - ray bright , but not galaxy clusters    and thus not subject to the sz effect , increases the noise in a    bulk - flow measurement based on the ka - b method .",
    "redshift accuracy : : :    the published catalogues contain erroneous cluster redshifts . for    instance , the reflex cluster rxcj0358.82955 , listed as being at    @xmath57 by bhringer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , was found to be at    @xmath58 in the macs survey ( ebeling et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "redshift errors of this magnitude have a dramatic impact on the    derived cluster x - ray luminosities which , as shown by kaeek , correlate    strongly with the monopole of the cmb signal at the cluster locations    and can be used efficiently to isolate the most massive clusters that    contribute most strongly to the ksz dipole .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] illustrates the differences in cluster x - ray luminosity ( scaled to the concordance @xmath21cdm model ) between the kabke sample and a simple cluster catalogue compiled from literature sources as described above .",
    "while the impact of the corrections applied by kabke ( and kaeek ) are obvious , the good overall agreement supports our notion that the existence of a statistically significant bulk flow can be successfully tested from immediately available public cluster data .",
    "going beyond the extended homogeneous cluster sample used by kabke , we have since launched scout ( sunyaev - zeldovich cluster observations as probes of the universe s tilt ) , a project designed to obtain an improved measurement and characterisation of the cluster bulk flow .",
    "scout will use almost 1,500 clusters out to , and possibly beyond , @xmath59 to probe large - scale bulk motions with the ka - b methodology to yet larger distances , and with greater statistical accuracy , than kaeek . upon completion , this cluster catalogue too will be released to the community . in the meantime , we demonstrate here that the basic dark flow results can be obtained with publicly available cluster data ( compiled as detailed above ) and the filtering schemes described above .",
    "kaeek and , particularly , akeke ( also keisler ) demonstrate that , for wmap5 data and the kabke filtering scheme , the measurement errors are dominated by residual primary cmb fluctuations due to cosmic variance . adding channels thus does not appreciably increase the s / n of the measurement .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] shows the scales subtended by the beam of the three wmap channels of the highest frequency .",
    "the wmap w band has the best angular resolution ( 13@xmath60 radius beam ) , whereas all clusters are practically unresolved in the q band .",
    "our analysis here thus uses only the four w channels of the wmap differential assemblies ( da ) . at high redshift",
    ", however , clusters are unresolved even in the w band ; we thus follow kaeek and impose a redshift limit of @xmath61 . again following kaeek",
    "we also remove clusters with @xmath62 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.12.4 kev ) because of the ( relatively ) more significant contamination from x - ray emission by agn .",
    "we then bin the resulting cluster sample as shown by the green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and evaluate the dipole _ at the constant aperture corresponding to zero monopole _ for each subsample .",

    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] where , for each subsample , we plot the final dipole against the central monopole in the unfiltered maps .",

    "the errors are evaluated from eqs 4,6 of akeke .",
    "the decrease in amplitude between @xmath67 and @xmath68 is consistent with the effects of beam dilution decreasing the optical depth of the more distant clusters . for comparison , for the same configuration kaeek ( table 1 ) obtain , using 5-yr wmap data and the first version of the scout catalog , the @xmath64-component and the direction as @xmath69 \\mu$]k and @xmath70 $ ] for @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "comparison with table 1 of kaeek shows that the publicly available cluster sample used here is adequate to verify the basic dark flow result .",
    "however , the same comparison also demonstrates a clear superiority already of the preliminary scout cluster sample ( used in kaeek ) for a more accurate measurement of the components and properties of the dark flow .",
    "as discussed in kabke2 and kaeek , our current calibration of the conversion from dipole amplitude to flow velocity may _ overestimate _ the velocity of the flow .",
    "a more robust conversion will be provided by scout where we will adopt an nfw profile to compute cluster properties , instead of the currently used isothermal @xmath72 model .",
    "also , so far we have measured only the axis of motion but not the direction of the flow along this axis because of the effects of filtering on the intrinsic ksz terms ( kaeek ) .",
    "we discuss this last point in more detail in this section , using the superior cluster catalog constructed for kaeek .",
    "a change of sign in the ksz term can occur because we measure the dipole from the filtered maps , and the convolution of the intrinsic ksz signal with a filter with wide side - lobes ( as in kabke ) _ can change the sign _ of the ksz signal for nfw clusters .",
    "the tsz signal , which is more concentrated towards the inner cluster regions , will be less susceptible to this effect .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] illustrates this issue .",
    "the maps we use include sz clusters and are convolved with the filter @xmath73 in @xmath74 space .",
    "this is equivalent to a convolution in the 2-d angular space @xmath75 . after this convolution",
    ", the cluster properties clearly depend on the intrinsic profile of the clusters .",
    "as shown by akke , the latter are well described by an nfw model and are poorly matched by an isothermal @xmath72 model .",
    "convolution will thus lead to different behavior of the sz profiles , including the sign of the convolved sz terms . in a measurement of the sz signal from filtered maps , the intrinsic properties of clusters",
    "are first convolved with the beam ( @xmath76 in @xmath23-space ) and then with the filter .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] shows this filtering function , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are legendre polynomials . because the convolution is performed in two dimensions , @xmath79 is multiplied by @xmath80 in the figure . the obvious side - lobes can affect the sign of the ksz term in the outer parts differently than the more concentrated ( for nwf profiles ) tsz terms .",
    "because of the particular form of the kabke filter , the sign of the ksz dipole measured from the inner parts ( @xmath81 in angular radius where @xmath82 remains positive ) would be the opposite of the one of the signal we measure from the final apertures ( @xmath83 ) .    do the data support this interpretation ?",
    "the 7-yr wmap data have sufficiently low instrument noise to probe the sz signal in the inner parts of the ( stacked ) clusters . using only data from the w channels which provide the best angular resolution ,",
    "we have evaluated the dipole in increasing cluster - centric apertures .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] where we plot the monopole and the dipoles against the aperture size for each of the four w das .",
    "we use the same cluster catalog as kaeek but limited to systems with @xmath84 erg s@xmath1 which yield the highest s / n , as shown in table 1 of kaeek . even though the tsz contributions can not be subtracted until we have recomputed fundamental cluster properties for an nfw model , the data , if noisy , indeed suggest a sign change as the aperture",
    "is increased .",
    "note that the zero - crossing is consistent for the @xmath85 components where the measurement is statistically significant .    in this context",
    "we stress again ( see also kabke ) the importance of using the entire aperture containing the full extent of the x - ray emitting gas that gives rise to the sz effect , if one is to measure a statistically significant signal .",
    "while there is thus indeed evidence for a sign change in the ksz signal which affects the direction of the kaeek - measured dipole , we emphasize again that a definitive answer will have to await a more complete , expanded and recalibrated scout catalog .",
    "the flow direction can , however , be determined from applications of the ka - b method to planck data , taking advantage of planck s angular resolution of 5@xmath60  a good match to the inner parts of clusters out to the limit of the scout catalog  and of the mission s 217 ghz channel for which the tsz component vanishes . since planck ( as well as chandra on the x - ray side ) will resolve scout clusters all the way out to @xmath86 , modelling of cluster properties with nfw profiles will be possible specifically for the most x - ray luminous systems which contribute most strongly to the dipole signal .",
    "this measurement was already proposed by us to the planck mission and will be performed when the planck data become public and the final scout catalog is assembled .    nevertheless , the tentative evidence of the sign flip from filtering , already discussed by us earlier , allows to constrain the direction along the axis of motion determined in kaeek . with the sign tentatively measured in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] the bulk flow motion will be in the direction of the detected cmb dipole at cluster positions ; it is given in table 1 of kaeek and the present data make little difference to it .",
    "within the errors this direction will then coincide with the direction of the flow from watkins et al at smaller scales ( @xmath87 mpc ) suggesting a coherent flow from the sub-100 mpc scales to those probed in kaeek ( @xmath88mpc ) .",
    "this paper demonstrates - using public x - ray data - the existence of a statistically significant dipole associated exclusively with clusters . the dipole signal is highly statistically significant and remains at apertures containing zero monopole .",
    "its amplitude further increases with the x - ray luminosity threshold of the cluster subsamples as it should if produced by the sz terms .",
    "however , the fact that it arises at zero monopole precludes any significant tsz contributions to the signal as discussed in kabke2 and akeke .",
    "we believe that the only explanation of this measurement is a large - scale bulk flow .",
    "any alternative explanation of the signal has so far not been suggested in the literature . adopting the large - scale - flow interpretation of the measurement , the properties of the flow ( amplitude , direction and variation with depth ) are fully consistent with fig . 2 and table 1 of akeke .",
    "adopting the bulk - flow interpretation of the measured dipole , with the calibration coefficients for this configuration from table 1 of kaeek , the flow amplitude would be @xmath91,000 km s@xmath1 in the direction given by eq .",
    "[ eq : dipole ] .",
    "the amplitude and the direction of the flow are consistent with being constant at depths @xmath89 mpc .",
    "note however the caveat that systematic calibration uncertainties likely cause us to overestimate the amplitude by up to 30% ( kabke2 ) , and that interpreting the direction of the flow from the ksz effect in the filtered maps remains subject to a sign change for which we present first tentative empirical evidence in fig.[fig : f5 ] .    in order to better probe and expand on our earlier ",
    "dark flow \" results we have designed an experiment named scout ( sz cluster observations as probes of the universe s tilt ) .",
    "the scout goals are to compile a sample of @xmath90 x - ray selected galaxy clusters with spectroscopically measured redshifts out to significantly greater distances than the current @xmath91 limit , and to apply the ka - b method to the 9-year wmap and planck maps .",
    "the latter mission , with its low noise , higher angular resolution and wider frequency coverage , will be particularly useful in calibrating the measurements .",
    "first scout results from a preliminary sample of @xmath92 clusters have been reported in kaeek .",
    "while the scout catalog is being assembled , we have shown in this paper that the basic dark flow results can be readily verified using publicly available cluster data .",
    "we make the sample generated from this database available upon publication at http://www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/data_public and encourage the community to test our findings using the tools provided there .",
    "in addition , this paper further addresses an important calibration issue resulting from our filtering of the cmb maps . using 7-year wmap w - channel data ,",
    "we show empirically that filtering may lead to a sign change in the ksz term ( see kaeek ) . to resolve this issue and improve the calibration we need to decrease the noise in the measurement and properly recalibrate the catalog of cluster properties ; both of these goals are achievable with a larger scout sample .",
    "application of our method to planck data in the 217 ghz channel , proposed by us earlier , will then allow accurate measurements of the velocity and direction of the flow .",
    "we acknowledge nasa nng04g089g/09-adp09 - 0050 and fis2009 - 07238/gr-234/syec csd 2007 - 00050 grants from spanish ministerio de educacin y ciencia / junta de castilla y len .",

    "<S> we present new results on the `` dark flow '' from a measurement of the dipole in the distribution of peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters , applying the methodology proposed and developed by us earlier . </S>",
    "<S> our latest measurement is conducted using new , low - noise 7-yr wmap data as well as an all - sky sample of x - ray selected galaxy clusters compiled exclusively from published catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the cmb signature of the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect finds a statistically significant dipole at the location of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the residual dipole outside the cluster regions is small , rendering our overall measurement 3 - 4 sigma significant . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the dipole correlates with cluster properties , being larger for the most x - ray luminous clusters , as required if the signal is produced by the sz effect . </S>",
    "<S> since it is measured at zero monopole , the dipole can not be due to the thermal sz effect . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with those obtained earlier by us from 5-yr wmap data and using a proprietary cluster catalog . in addition , they are robust to quadrupole removal , demonstrating that quadrupole leakage contributes negligibly to the signal . </S>",
    "<S> the lower noise of the 7-yr wmap also allows us , for the first time , to obtain tentative empirical confirmation of our earlier conjecture that the adopted filtering alters the sign of the ksz effect for realistic clusters and thus of the deduced direction of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is consistent with our earlier measurement in both the amplitude and direction . assuming the filtering indeed alters the sign of the ksz effect from the clusters , the direction agrees well also with the results of independent work using galaxies as tracers at lower distances . </S>",
    "<S> we make all maps and cluster templates derived by us from public data available to the scientific community to allow independent tests of our method and findings .    </S>",
