    "ever since the postulation of mesons by yukawa in 1934 , and the discovery of the pion in 1947 , it has been clear that mesons play a crucial role in low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "the long - range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction at low energies is clearly dominated by one - pion exchange , and direct evidence for the role of mesons in nucleon structure comes from the negative charge radius of the neutron which can be attributed to the virtual @xmath4 process .",
    "furthermore , meson - exchange currents have proven to be essential for a quantitative description of many low - momentum - transfer processes , as , for instance , radiative neutron capture at threshold , near - threshold electro - disintegration of the deuteron , and the isovector magnetic form factors of nuclei .",
    "also , a non - perturbative pionic cloud around the nucleon offers a straightforward explanation @xcite of the @xmath5 flavor asymmetry of the proton s antiquark sea observed in the nmc experiment @xcite .    the fundamental role of pion clouds in nuclear physics",
    "is well explained in qcd as a consequence of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , and an interesting and important question is on the region of applicability of chiral qcd lagrangians , and at what distance scale this description will fail .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to investigate whether there exists a smooth transition between low - energy nuclear physics degrees of freedom , i.e. , baryons and mesons , and a description in terms of quarks and gluons which is adequate for hard processes . in particular , we study whether the nucleon s antiquark distributions , as observed in inclusive , unpolarized , deep inelastic lepton and neutrino scattering , can be attributed entirely to its virtual meson cloud or if they should be described in terms of quarks and gluons . for this aim , we compare the contribution of the meson cloud with primary sea quark distributions which serve as a non - perturbative input to the qcd evolution equations .    in traditional nuclear physics , the crucial quantity which determines the strength of the pionic contribution to the nucleon s structure is the @xmath6 form factor . in a quark model picture , the latter",
    "is intimately related to the confinement size of the quarks , and there is a long standing theoretical puzzle associated with it .",
    "the need for a sufficiently strong tensor force to reproduce the @xmath7 ratio and the quadrupole moment of the deuteron suggests a rather hard @xmath8 vertex at small momentum transfers , and consequently most @xmath9 meson - exchange potentials which are fit to the rich body of @xmath9 phase shift data have a relatively high momentum - cutoff , with , for example , @xmath10 gev in monopole form for the bonn potential @xcite .    on the contrary , hadronic models of baryons with meson clouds , like the skyrmion , typically have a rather soft @xmath11 form factor @xcite , in a quenched lattice qcd calculation a soft form factor was `` measured '' with a monopole mass of @xmath12 gev @xcite , and also in a recent analysis in the framework of qcd sum rules a soft monopole cut - off of @xmath13 gev was suggested @xcite . in addition , there is further evidence for a fairly soft @xmath11 vertex from other sources : arguments based on resolving the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xcite as well as the apparent charge dependence of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings @xcite both suggest a relatively soft @xmath11 form factor with @xmath16 gev .",
    "threshold pion production from @xmath17 scattering can best be reproduced by using a soft @xmath11 vertex , with @xmath18 gev @xcite , and pion electro - production data on hydrogen also point towards a very soft @xmath11 form factor @xcite .",
    "today , there exist efforts to reconcile the @xmath9 phase shift data with a soft @xmath11 vertex .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath19 interactions @xcite as well as @xmath20 scattering @xcite allows one to avoid the need for hard form factors , and haidenbauer et al .",
    "@xcite presented a successful model where both one- and two - pion exchanges were included with soft @xmath11 and @xmath21 vertices .",
    "furthermore , a soft @xmath22 is preferable to avoid contradictions with data on the nucleon s antiquark distributions .",
    "thomas @xcite pointed out that deep inelastic scattering data on integrals over the momentum carried by sea quarks in the proton , i.e. , sum rules , can be used to restrict the @xmath23-dependence of the @xmath11 vertex .",
    "frankfurt et al .",
    "@xcite showed that to describe the steep decrease of the sea quark distributions with @xmath24 the vertex cut - off , in a monopole parametrization , should be less than 0.5 gev .",
    "subsequently , sparked by experimental results of the nmc group @xcite which suggested a violation of the gottfried sum rule the analysis of this mechanism was focused on the @xmath5 breaking component of the quark sea @xcite , and more mesons were included into the nucleon s virtual cloud @xcite .    in many early works in that realm solely integrated quantities , i.e. , sum rules , were discussed @xcite , and in others either only the flavor breaking share of the nucleon s antiquark sea was considered @xcite or the analysis was limited to certain combinations of the nucleon s sea quark distributions @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nucleon s entire antiquark sea was attributed to its meson cloud at a scale of @xmath25 gev@xmath26 while using hard vertices which are almost consistent with the bonn meson - exchange model . their conjecture , however ,",
    "is based predominantly on integrated quantities ( sum rules ) , and the contribution of the mesonic cloud was multiplied with a wave function renormalization factor which is at variance with the standard nuclear physics definition of the @xmath11 coupling constant @xcite , as will be clarified later . besides , to describe the flavor asymmetry in the sea quark distributions specific assumptions on the quark distributions in the bare , recoiling baryons were needed .    also in this work",
    ", we investigate the possibility to attribute the nucleon s full antiquark sea to its virtual mesonic cloud .",
    "however , we do not consider sum rules which contain contributions from the small @xmath24 region where shadowing effects are important , but we study the @xmath24-dependence of the antiquark distributions , emphasizing especially the tails of the parton distribution functions which are most sensitive to the meson - nucleon form factors .    for the first time , the dependence of the parameters which characterize the underlying convolution picture , i.e. , the cut - offs at the vertices , on the scale , @xmath2 , where perturbative qcd evolution of the non - perturbative sea quark distributions starts is studied , and the qualitatively different behavior in the flavor singlet and non - singlet channels is elucidated .",
    "also , we analyze which mesonic virtualities and loop momenta yield the dominant contributions in the respective convolution integrals , and , in essence , whether there exists a smooth transition between hadronic and quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , new improved fits of the nucleon s unpolarized parton distributions to a host of deep inelastic scattering data became available from martin , roberts and stirling @xcite as well as the cteq collaboration @xcite .",
    "using those , we update the analysis of the contribution of the virtual meson cloud of the nucleon to its antiquark distributions , and separately adjust the @xmath11 , @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) and @xmath21 form factors to the flavor @xmath29 and @xmath5 breaking components of the nucleon s antiquark sea and to its strange quark content , following the framework presented , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in particular , we fit the various meson - nucleon vertices to the nucleon s antiquark distributions at different values of the four - momentum transfer , @xmath2 , where the contamination from gluon splitting into @xmath30 pairs is not yet dominant .",
    "in addition to the major contribution arising from virtual pions , we also consider the kaonic cloud , with the corresponding coupling constants fixed by spin - flavor @xmath31 which holds much better for the coupling constants than it does for the masses , as has been observed in hyperon - nucleon scattering @xcite . however , other mesons whose contributions are even more suppressed as due to their higher masses were not considered .",
    "the form factors that we determine in this work are still significantly softer than what is used in most meson - exchange models of the @xmath9 interaction , and they indicate that the @xmath21 vertex is considerably softer than the @xmath11 vertex and that the cut - offs in the strange sector are harder than in the non - strange sectors .",
    "we analyze the relationship between the hardness of the meson - nucleon form factors and @xmath2 , the scale where qcd evolution begins .",
    "while the agreement of our calculations with the data - based parametrizations is satisfactory and practically scale independent for the flavor breaking share of the nucleon s antiquark distributions , the corresponding flavor singlet component is quite poorly described in the convolution picture and it is contaminated with a sound scale dependence .",
    "the meson virtualities and loop momenta that are relevant in the deep inelastic process investigated here , @xmath32 gev@xmath26 and @xmath33 gev , are very different from those probed in low - energy nuclear physics phenomena , as , for instance , in the meson - exchange descriptions of the @xmath9 interaction where meson momenta of the order of the pion mass are dominant , and the validity of chiral qcd lagrangians in this regime is questionable .",
    "actually , the analysis performed here hints that hard form factors at the meson - nucleon vertex may reflect the presence of a gluon cloud in the nucleon which can not be resolved by a low energy probe , and that there exists no smooth transition between hadronic and quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the theoretical framework with which we attempt to connect the nucleon s sea quark distributions to its virtual meson cloud . in sec .",
    "iii , we present results of our fits to the flavor @xmath29 and @xmath5 breaking components of the nucleon s antiquark sea and to its strange quark content .",
    "we discuss the results of our calculations in sec .",
    "iv , and summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "it has been suggested by sullivan @xcite that in lepton scattering the virtual one - pion exchange may give a significant contribution to the nucleon s deep inelastic structure functions which scales in the bjorken limit like the original process , and the generalization of that mechanism is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "however , it is also common wisdom that , at large @xmath2 , a significant fraction of the nucleon s antiquark sea originates from gluon splitting into @xmath34 pairs and not from the mesonic cloud .",
    "this perturbative process is approximately flavor symmetric and hence does not contribute to the flavor @xmath29 , @xmath35 \\ , \\label{eq : su3}\\ ] ] and @xmath5 , @xmath36 \\ , \\label{eq : su2}\\ ] ] breaking components of the nucleon s antiquark distributions .    the direct meson cloud contribution of fig .",
    "1a can be written as a convolution of the virtual meson s antiquark distribution and its momentum dependence in the infinite momentum frame , @xmath37 where , in our investigation , the sum runs over @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and where the @xmath40 are spin - flavor @xmath31 clebsch - gordan factors .",
    "we assume the quark sea in the mesons to be flavor symmetric , and thus only the @xmath0 and k _ valence antiquark _",
    "distributions contribute to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : su3 ] ) and ( [ eq : su2 ] ) .",
    "we neglect the slight difference between the latter , and take @xmath41 from fits to drell - yan pair production experiments .",
    "we also disregard contributions from mesons other than the @xmath0 and the k which are strongly suppressed due to their higher masses as well as interference effects , as , for instance , between the @xmath0 and the @xmath42 .",
    "actually , the latter vanish for the unpolarized distributions , to which we limit our discussions , because the corresponding trace over the baryon spinors and a pseudoscalar and a vector vertex is identically zero .",
    "the virtual meson s light - cone distribution in the nucleon s cloud , @xmath43 which characterizes its probability of carrying a fraction @xmath44 of the nucleon s momentum in the infinite momentum frame , can be be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 for an intermediate , on - mass - shell octet or decuplet baryon , respectively , and where for the latter a rarita - schwinger spin vector was employed when evaluating the trace over the pseudoscalar vertices .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmb ] ) is over the meson s virtuality , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is its four - momentum , and the upper limit of the integration is determined purely by kinematics , with @xmath49 here , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the nucleon mass , the mass of the intermediate baryon and the meson mass . for the pion - nucleon couplings we use the most recent values of the pseudoscalar coupling constants of @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 @xcite , and the kaon - nucleon couplings",
    "are related to the latter using spin - flavor @xmath31 which agrees well with hyperon - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "the only , a priori , unknown quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmb ] ) is then the form factor , @xmath55 , which governs the emission of an off - mass - shell meson , and it is usually parametrized either in monopole , dipole or exponential ( gaussian ) form , where @xmath56 and where the cut - off masses can depend , in general , also on the meson - baryon channel under consideration . for our purposes , differences between the various forms given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : for ] ) are not particularly important , and we will translate between the different cut - off parameters using the approximate relation given by kumano @xcite , @xmath57 which is based on demanding an identical reduction of the various form factors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : for ] ) to 40% of their pole values , i.e. , @xmath58 . with this , the form factors are compared at large virtualities , @xmath59 .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard procedure of relating the different cut - off parameters by means of the slopes of the form factors at the meson poles , which , conversely , would lead to @xmath60 and which is a good approximation for small virtualities . as the major contributions to the convolution integrals stem from fairly large mesonic virtualities of @xmath32 gev@xmath26 , as will be discussed in sect .",

    "@xcite , except that we also consider kaonic loops and that we vary the form factors in the various meson - baryon channels independently . in refs .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the sullivan contribution , depicted in fig .  1 , was in addition multiplied with a wave function renormalization factor , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 this prescription is at variance with the fact that in coordinate space at large distances the meson - loop diagrams in fig .  1",
    "describe physical processes whose cross - sections involve physical , renormalized couplings . note that this observation is used in nuclear physics to fix the @xmath11 coupling constant .    in the underlying two - phase model , the physical nucleon , @xmath70 ,",

    "this is the prescription which we follow , and it is consistent with the standard nuclear physics definition of the @xmath11 coupling constant derived from the @xmath9 interaction at large distances .    instead of the covariant formalism outlined here , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite `` old - fashioned '' time - ordered perturbation theory in the infinite momentum frame was used .",
    "the two diagrams in fig .  1 are then treated on an equal footing , as the active particle and the spectator are both on their respective mass - shells .",
    "however , energy is not conserved at the meson - nucleon vertices , and the form factors , @xmath78 , are unknown . in the covariant formalism , it is thus more straightforward to compare the vertices  in the form of @xmath55 of eq .",

    "there is an approved experiment at fermilab , e866 , which will measure the quantity @xmath154 over the whole relevant kinematic region and which will settle this issue @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in the last section , the description of the _ flavor non - singlet _ share of the nucleon s antiquark distributions is quite satisfactory for @xmath24-values larger than about 0.2 , and the quality of the agreement of our meson cloud calculations with the data - based pdfs is independent of the scale @xmath2 .",

    "this substantiates what has been discussed in the above about the qualitatively different behavior in the flavor singlet and non - singlet channels .",
    "the variations of @xmath159 with @xmath2 , on the other hand , are induced via the interplay of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : su3a ] ) and ( [ eq : su2a ] ) through the scale dependence of the @xmath27 vertex which contributes not only to @xmath97 but also to the flavor non - singlet distribution @xmath79 .",
    "the strong @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath27 vertex signals a correlation between the presence of gluonic degrees of freedom at low @xmath2 and contributions from the nucleon s virtual kaon cloud . at this point ,",

    "( [ eq : su3a ] ) , the values for @xmath92 listed in this work are actually _ upper bounds _ on that quantity .",
    "thus , the scenario presented here has to be viewed as an extreme case .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by the fact that the meson cloud can only describe the tail of the flavor singlet antiquark distribution , while the mismatch at @xmath160 is probably due to gluon splitting into @xmath30 pairs , and there are no stringent reasons why the influence of gluonic degrees of freedom should be limited to the aforementioned small-@xmath24 range only .",
    "this suggests that a smooth transition between the low - energy nuclear physics degrees of freedom , i.e. , baryons and mesons , and a description in terms of quarks and gluons which is adequate for hard processes does not seem to exist . it has been clearly shown in this work that",
    ", even at a small @xmath2 , it is _ not _ possible to attribute the entire sea quark distributions in the nucleon to its mesonic cloud .",
    "firstly , the meson - nucleon vertices which are necessary to describe the _ flavor breaking _ share of the nucleon s antiquark distributions in the meson cloud picture outlined here are significantly different from the respective quantities used in low - energy nuclear physics , as , for instance , the cut - offs employed in the bonn potential . and ,",
    "furthermore , even when freely adjusting the respective form factors , a satisfactory description of the _ flavor singlet _ component of the nucleon s antiquark sea is not possible .",
    "not only are there large discrepancies already for @xmath24-values smaller than about 0.3 , but also the perturbative evolution of the singlet component to higher values of the four - momentum transfer by means of the qcd evolution equations is incompatible with the meson cloud convolution picture .",
    "this shows that gluon degrees of freedom play an important role in the structure of the nucleon , even at a scale of @xmath81 gev@xmath26 .    at small @xmath24 and high energies the virtual photon converts into a hadronic @xmath34 state at a distance @xmath161 in the target rest frame .",
    "if this coherence length is larger than the dimension of the target , @xmath162 it is not the virtual photon probing the target but this @xmath34 state , and this is the basis of the shadowing phenomenon .",
    "hence , the nave impulse approximation picture that was applied in this work to the nucleon s virtual meson cloud is only applicable if the relevant distances are larger than the coherence length @xmath163 . as the important meson loop momenta are of the order of @xmath164 gev , the significant distances between the nucleon and the mesons driving the convolution integrals are @xmath165 fm , and the shadowing condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh2 ] ) is already satisfied at @xmath166 .",
    "this underlines our conclusion that at small @xmath24 , where absorptive effects are important , the meson cloud picture is not adequate and different degrees of freedom are dominant .",
    "note that in most low energy nuclear physics applications of the meson - exchange picture absorptive effects are included , eiher via explicit treatment or by means of simply neglecting the @xmath167-contribution in the respective pion - exchange potentials .",
    "also , these absorption effects should lead to a modification of the @xmath23-dependence of the process @xmath168 for small @xmath24 , namely the cross section would not behave @xmath169 at @xmath170 due to interference of the pion exchange and the pion - pomeron cut .",
    "this effect is well known in strong interaction physics , for a review see ref .",
    "in this work , we have updated the analysis of the sullivan mechanism , i.e. , the contribution of the nucleon s virtual meson cloud to the deep inelastic structure functions , by using various recent improved parton distribution functions fit to the host of inclusive , deep inelastic lepton and neutrino scattering data .",
    "we have taken into account contributions from the two lightest mesons , the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 , and , at various @xmath2 , we have separately adjusted the form factors in the octet and decuplet channels and in the strange and non - strange sectors to the @xmath29 and @xmath5 flavor breaking components of the nucleon s antiquark sea and , simultaneously , to its strange quark content .",
    "we find that we can only achieve a good description of the @xmath29 as well as the @xmath5 flavor asymmetry of the nucleon s antiquark sea if we allow the @xmath11 and @xmath21 vertices to differ significantly , and that , in order to be able to also describe the tail of the strange quark component , we have to use harder cut - offs in the kaonic sector .",
    "while the agreement of our calculations with the data - based parametrizations is satisfactory and scale independent for the flavor breaking share of the nucleon s antiquark distributions , the corresponding flavor singlet component is quite poorly described in the convolution picture .",
    "this stresses the importance of gluonic degrees of freedom , even at such a low scale as @xmath81 gev@xmath26 .",
    "in particular , our analysis suggests exponential cut - off masses of @xmath171 mev , @xmath172 mev and @xmath173 mev , respectively .",
    "these results are based on two recent empirical parton distribution functions , mrs(a ) and cteq3 m , which agree well with both the determination of the nucleon s strange quark content by the ccfr collaboration , related to the @xmath29 breaking , and the measurement of the @xmath5 asymmetry by the na51 collaboration . due to our inability to clearly distinguish between gluonic and meson cloud contributions in the flavor singlet channel , the @xmath92 and @xmath96 given here are upper bounds of those quantities , while the @xmath155 has to be understood as a lower limit .",
    "our findings are in qualitative agreement with the faster fall - off of the @xmath174 electromagnetic transition form factor as compared to the proton s electromagnetic form factor , and they suggest a sound breaking of the nave @xmath31 symmetry relating the quark - substructure of the nucleon and the @xmath114-isobar . also , the vertices that we obtain from our analysis of the deep inelastic scattering process are still significantly softer than those employed in most effective @xmath9 potentials fit to the rich body of experimental phase shift data , although the discrepancy we find is smaller than that quoted in early works in this context .",
    "they correspond to a typical quark confinement size of about 0.6 fm .",
    "note , however , that the meson loop momenta that are probed in the deep inelastic process investigated here , @xmath175 gev , are very different from those relevant for low - energy nuclear physics phenomena , as , for instance , in the meson - exchange descriptions of the @xmath9 interaction , and the respective distances are smaller than the typical confinement size .",
