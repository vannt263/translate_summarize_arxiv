    "the hierarchy problem in the standard model ( sm ) is expected to give a clue to explore physics beyond the sm .",
    "this problem is essentially related to quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs boson mass , and it strongly suggests the existence of new physics at the tev scale . at the new physics scale , the problem is expected to be resolved due to the appearance of a new symmetry which controls the higgs boson mass . with this philosophy ,",
    "a lot of scenarios have been proposed so far .",
    "the most famous example is the supersymmety ( susy ) , by which quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs boson mass are completely cancelled .",
    "another example is the gauge - higgs unification , by which the gauge invariance in higher dimensional space - time protects the higgs potential from any ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent corrections .    in this article , we consider the third possibility , so - called the little higgs ( lh ) scenario @xcite , in which the higgs boson mass is controlled by a global symmetry . in this scenario , the higgs boson is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry . due to the symmetry imposed ,",
    "new particles such as heavy gauge bosons and top - partners are necessarily introduced , and main quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs boson mass vanish at one - loop level due to contributions of these particles . unlike the susy scenario , the cancellation of the quadratic divergence is achieved only at one - loop level , thus the lh model needs a uv completion at some higher scale .",
    "however , due to the cancellation at one - loop level , the fine - tuning of the higgs boson mass is avoided even if the cutoff scale of the lh model is around 10 tev . as a result ,",
    "the lh model solves the little hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the original lh model is severely constrained by electroweak precision measurements due to direct couplings among a new heavy gauge boson and sm particles @xcite . in order to resolve the problem ,",
    "the implementation of the @xmath6 symmetry called t - parity to the model has been proposed @xcite . under the parity ,",
    "almost all new particles are t - odd , while the sm particles are t - even , which is a t - even new particle as shown in the next section . ] .",
    "thanks to the symmetry , dangerous interactions stated above are prohibited @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lightest t - odd particle ( ltp ) becomes stable , which is electrically and color neutral , and has a mass of @xmath7(100 ) gev in many little higgs models with t - parity @xcite .",
    "therefore , these models provide a good candidate for dark matter @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study signatures of the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which is expected to explore various new - physics models @xcite .",
    "the lht is the simplest model realizing the lh scenario with the t - parity , and considered to be an attractive reference model .",
    "since the lhc is a hadron collider , new colored particles have an important role to explore physics beyond the sm .",
    "as shown in the next section , top - partners are necessarily introduced in the lh models , which are responsible for the cancellation of quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs boson mass from top loop diagrams .",
    "furthermore , masses of these partners are expected to be less than @xmath8 1 tev , and the partners will be copiously produced at the lhc @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the productions of the top partners at the lhc with a realistic simulation study , and show that these signatures are clearly distinguishable from sm backgrounds .",
    "furthermore , we find that it is also possible to test the lht by investigating a non - trivial relation among the signatures .",
    "we also consider how accurately model parameters of the lht are determined , and discuss its implication to the property of the ltp dark matter such as how precisely the relic abundance of the dark matter is estimated with the lhc data .",

    "now , we consider the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production processes and their signals at the lhc . at the lhc , there are two types of @xmath0 production processes , pair production and single production processes , both of which are important .",

    "thus , we need to develop kinematical cuts to suppress the @xmath152 background .",
    "we propose to use the fact that the jets in the signal events are likely to be very energetic because they are from the decay of heavy particles ( i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath154 ) .",
    "consequently , the signal events are expected to have large @xmath155 , which is defined by the sum of transverse momenta of high @xmath156 objects and missing transverse momentum @xmath157 : @xmath158 in our study , only the jets with @xmath159 are included into the high @xmath156 objects in order to reduce the contamination of qcd activities .",
    "we expect that the number of background events can be significantly reduced once we require that @xmath155 be large enough ; in the following , we will see that this is indeed the case .    once the backgrounds are reduced , the @xmath145 production events are reconstructed relatively easily . here , we concentrate on the dominant decay mode @xmath146 .",
    "then , the signal events are primarily from the process @xmath160 , followed by @xmath146 and @xmath161 . in particular , in order to constrain the mass of @xmath0",
    ", we use the process in which one of the @xmath117-boson decays hadronically while the other decays leptonically . at the parton level ,",

    "using the fact that , in the signal events , the missing momentum is due to the neutrino emission , we reconstruct two @xmath0 systems , which we call @xmath165-system and @xmath166-system ; here , the @xmath165-system ( @xmath166-system ) consists of high @xmath156 objects which are expected to be from @xmath0 or @xmath154 whose decay is followed by the leptonic ( hadronic ) decay of the @xmath117-boson . to determine @xmath165- and @xmath167-systems",

    "thus , once many samples of @xmath144 production events become available at the lhc , it will be possible to determine the distribution of the @xmath220 variable for each value of @xmath211 .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath205 variable for the @xmath144 production process was studied in @xcite with the choice of @xmath221 . in our discussion , we use the @xmath205 analysis to constrain @xmath204 and @xmath203 , so it is necessary to study the distribution of the @xmath205 variable for various values of @xmath211 .    to see how the distribution of the @xmath205 variable depends on @xmath211 , we generate the @xmath144 events ( as well as @xmath152 backgrounds ) and derive the distribution of @xmath205 . here , we intend to use the events : @xmath222 and we adopt the kinematical cuts used in @xcite :    * no isolated leptons , * @xmath223 , and @xmath224",
    ".    notice that large missing @xmath156 is expected due to the emission of two @xmath2 particles .",
    "then , in order to reconstruct two top systems , we use the hemisphere analysis with which all the high @xmath156 objects are assigned to one of two hemispheres , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , so that @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the momentum of the @xmath229-th hemisphere which is defined as @xmath230 and @xmath231 with @xmath232 being the angle between @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "( for the details to construct the hemispheres , see @xcite . ) in the following , the first hemisphere is defined as the one which contains the leading jet .",
    "once two hemispheres are determined , we impose the following cuts to eliminate backgrounds :    * numbers of jets ( with @xmath159 ) in @xmath225 and @xmath226 are either equal to or smaller than 3 .",
    "* @xmath235 ( @xmath236 , @xmath237 ) , where @xmath238 is the transverse momentum of the hemisphere @xmath239 .",
    "* @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the invariant mass of the @xmath229-th hemisphere ( i.e. , @xmath242 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , with the cuts iii-0 @xmath19 iii-3 , peaks around @xmath243 are obtained in the distributions of @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "then , postulating that the momenta of @xmath104 and @xmath206 are given by those of two hemispheres , we calculate the distribution of the @xmath205 variable defined in eq .",
    "( [ mt2 ^ 2 ] ) for several values of the postulated mass @xmath211 . here",
    ", we use the underlying parameters for the point 2 . the results for @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , for which the theoretically expected end - points are @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 , respectively ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_mt2pt2 ] . here ,",
    "the distributions shown in the figure include contributions from the @xmath152 background ; however , we have checked that there is no contamination of the @xmath152 events at the end - point region .",
    "as one can see , the position of the upper end - point changes consistently with the theoretical value of the end - point .",
    "thus , by using the @xmath205 variable , we expect to obtain a constraint on the @xmath204 vs.  @xmath203 plane , which can be transferred to a constraint on the @xmath109 vs.  @xmath130 plane . in order to derive the constraint , it is necessary to understand how well the position of the upper end - point can be determined .",
    "detailed properties of the distribution of the @xmath205 variable should depend on the kinematical cuts as well as on the detector performances .",
    "an extensive study of the fitting function to determine the end - point is beyond the scope of this paper . here , we simply use the quadratic function to estimate the end - point .",
    "for example , for @xmath252 ( for which the theoretical prediction of the end - point is @xmath253 ) , the end - point is estimated as @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) using the data with @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "thus , in the following discussion , we adopt the error of @xmath258 in the determination of the end - point , although a better result may be possible if a detailed study of the shape of the end - point is performed .",
    "now we discuss how and how well we can test the lht model using the results obtained in the previous section . as we discussed in section[sec : model ] , the lht model is parametrized by two parameters , @xmath130 and @xmath109 . thus",
    ", if there exists three or more observables , a non - trivial test becomes possible .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt the point 2 as the underlying parameter point , and assume that @xmath96 , @xmath259 , and the end - point of the @xmath205 variable can be experimentally determined as @xmath260_{\\rm point\\ 2 } \\pm \\delta m_{t_+ } ,    \\label{const_mt+ }    \\\\",

    "we adopt the following uncertainties of the quantities mentioned above :    * case 1 : @xmath262 * case 2 : @xmath263    in the case 2 , smaller uncertainties are adopted compared to the case 1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvslam2 ] , we show the allowed region on the @xmath130 vs.@xmath109 plane for the cases 1 and 2 . as one can see , measurements of @xmath96 , @xmath259 , and @xmath264 provide three different constraints on the @xmath130 vs.  @xmath109 plane .",
    "it should be noticed that , because each of the constraints gives a narrow band on the @xmath130 vs.  @xmath109 plane , we can quantitatively test if the observed signals are consistent with the predictions of the lht model ; if the three bands meet at a single point , as shown in fig.[fig : fvslam2 ] , it gives a quantitative confirmation of the lht model .",
    "it is also notable that the measurements of @xmath96 , @xmath259 , and @xmath264 give accurate determinations of @xmath130 and @xmath109 .",
    "for example , reading the lower and upper bounds on these parameters from the allowed region in the case 1 ( case 2 ) , we obtain the constraints @xmath265 and @xmath266 ( @xmath267 and @xmath268 ) .",
    "one of the implications is that , with the determination of @xmath130 , we can also determine @xmath204 in the lht model .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ m(a_h ) ] ) . )",
    "since @xmath2 is a very weakly interacting particle , the direct determination of its mass is difficult as discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath130 gives an important information about @xmath204 .",
    "finally , we discuss an implication to cosmology .",
    "@xmath2 is a viable candidate of dark matter .",
    "the thermal relic density of @xmath2 strongly depends on the pair annihilation cross section of @xmath2 ; in the present case , @xmath2 pair - annihilates into weak boson pair via the @xmath269-channel exchange of the higgs boson .",
    "the pair annihilation cross section is obtained once @xmath130 and @xmath66 are known .",
    "as we have discussed , @xmath130 can be determined with the studies of the top partners .",
    "in addition , at the lhc , it is expected that the higgs boson will be found and its properties will be studied in detail . for example , if @xmath270 , the higgs mass will be determined with the uncertainty of @xmath271 @xcite ; in the following , we assume that the higgs mass can be determined with the accuracy of @xmath272 at the point 2 . then , combining the information about the top - partners and the higgs boson from the lhc , it will become possible to reconstruct the thermal relic density of @xmath2 .",
    "comparison of the theoretically calculated relic density and observed dark matter density provides an important test of the cosmological scenario in the framework of the lht model ; if the theoretical prediction of the relic density is consistent with the dark matter density observed , it will be a strong indication of the scenario where @xmath2 is dark matter .",
    "= 0.6    to see how well we can perform this test , we calculate the thermal relic density @xmath273 ; the contours of constant @xmath274 ( with @xmath275 being the hubble constant in units of km / sec / mpc ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhomega ] on @xmath130 vs.  @xmath66 plane .",
    "when @xmath276 , @xmath2 becomes lighter than @xmath163 .",
    "in such a case , the pair annihilation cross section of @xmath2 is extremely suppressed , resulting in very large value of @xmath274 . on the contrary , for @xmath277",
    ", @xmath274 is found to have mild dependence on @xmath130 and @xmath66 . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the expected constraints on @xmath130 and @xmath66 .",
    "as one can see , determination of the @xmath130 parameter plays an important role in reconstructing the dark matter density .",
    "in particular , we can see that , combined with the precise measurement of the higgs mass , @xmath274 can be reconstructed very accurately in the case 2 where the masses of top partners and mixing parameter @xmath94 are well determined ; with the determination of @xmath66 and @xmath130 for the case 2 mentioned above , the density parameter is constrained to be @xmath278 .",
    "( the underlying value of @xmath274 is @xmath279 . ) on the contrary , in the case 1 where the uncertainty in @xmath130 is relatively large , bound on the density parameter is found to be @xmath280 .",
    "thus , in such a case , @xmath274 can not be bounded from above .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that we chose the underlying value of @xmath204 close to @xmath281 ; with larger value of @xmath204 , a better reconstruction of @xmath274 is expected even with a larger uncertainty in @xmath130 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the @xmath145 pair , single-@xmath282 and @xmath144 pair productions at the lhc in the framework of the littlest higgs model with t - parity , by performing a numerical simulation on three representative points . for @xmath283 pair production process",
    ", the main sm background comes from @xmath152 production .",
    "we have developed kinematical cuts to suppress the @xmath152 background , and found that the signal events can be well extracted from the background .",
    "we have shown that an accurate determination of the mass of @xmath0 is possible .",
    "for single-@xmath0 production , we have also proposed a set of kinematical cuts to suppress the sm backgrounds which are from @xmath152 pair production and single-@xmath104 production , and shown that the signal events can be well reconstructed . from the measurement of the single-@xmath0 production cross section as well as the measurement of @xmath96 in the @xmath145 pair production ,",
    "we can obtain the information on the mixing parameter ( @xmath259 ) between @xmath0 and top quark . for @xmath144 pair production ,",
    "studying the upper end - point of the @xmath205 distribution ( @xmath284 ) , a certain relation between @xmath204 and @xmath203 is obtained .",
    "since the top sector in the lht is parametrized by two parameters , @xmath130 and @xmath109 , each measurement of these three observables provides a relation between @xmath130 and @xmath109 .",
    "we have shown that the measurements of the three observables give non - trivial determinations of the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath109 , and hence a quantitative test of the lht model can be performed at the lhc .    in the lht model , @xmath2 is a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "since the thermal relic density of @xmath2 strongly depends on the pair annihilation cross section of @xmath2 into weak boson pair via @xmath269-channel exchange of the higgs boson , the masses of @xmath2 and higgs boson are important to calculate the thermal relic density of @xmath2 . using the facts that @xmath2 mass",
    "can be determined by the parameter @xmath130 , and that not only the discovery of higgs boson but also the measurement of the higgs mass are expected at the lhc , we have shown that the relic density of @xmath2 can be calculated very accurately by using the lhc results .",
    "this will provide an important test of the cosmological scenario where @xmath2 becomes dark matter .",
    "our studies here suggest not only that the lhc has a great potential to discover the heavy partner of top quark which is responsible for the cancellation of the main quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs mass parameter , but also that the lhc can provide important measurements of the observables that would lead us to a crucial tests of the lht model .",
