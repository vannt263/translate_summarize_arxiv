    "graph or network is a topological concept that represents connectivity with nodes and branches .",
    "this concept has been applied to various fields such as an electrical circuit , a molecular structure , and a computer network .",
    "their properties are well affected by the connectivity of network .",
    "there are no information in terms of length , width , and curve of branches .",
    "+ superconducting networks , which consist of multiply connected thin wire of superconductor , are typical examples of them . in superconducting networks ,",
    "the network structure well affect to the physical properties because this system is sensitive to phase coherence of the order parameter over the network .",
    "in fact , phase interference phenomena are driven by the magnetic field known as little - parks oscillation .",
    "@xcite characteristic vortex configurations are caused for various geometries of the network.@xcite so one can observe the network effect as dips or cusps of variation in magnetic field responses .",
    "when the line width of the network becomes thick , topology of the network is kept .",
    "however it has remained unclear in detail whether vortex configuration is kept or not . in these systems ,",
    "the line width @xmath0 is assumed as much smaller than the lattice constant @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it seems to be difficult to investigate and compare effects of the line width experimentally because measured temperature is close to superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 in most cases .",
    "+ in this paper , to investigate the size effects of the wire for vortex configuration , we propose a superconductor - normal metal bilayer wire network as a new network . when a superconductor and a normal metal are joined with good electrical contact , superconductivity is weakened and induces into the normal metal known as the proximity effect.@xcite in this case , since the order parameter could be modified along the width direction , novel network effects and size effects are expected to occur .",
    "in addition , a relation with studies of superconducting films with antidot arrays @xcite may be revealed in terms of vortex configuration .",
    "generally , a duality relation is existed between the antidot arrays that @xmath0 is considered as comparable to @xmath1 and the superconducting networks . from our results of little - parks oscillation",
    ", a superconducting current is found to flow through a path enclosed by edge of the wire , not center of the wire and stable vortex configurations are found to appear in the same way as the case of a monolayer wire network .",
    "it means that the dual network consisted of vortices is kept regardless of the line width of the base network .",
    "to make a comparison , two types of a honeycomb network that we used were fabricated by standard electron beam lithography .",
    "one consists of pb monolayer wire , the other pb - au bilayer wire .",
    "the gold layer of @xmath3 @xmath4 m and the lead layer of @xmath5 @xmath4 m are thermally evaporated on a sio@xmath6 substrate followed by the resist lift - off .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) image of the sample .",
    "these samples have about @xmath7 cells with lattice constant of @xmath8 @xmath4 m , line width of @xmath9 @xmath4 m . + little - parks oscillation is a powerful tool to investigate the configuration of vortices on the network .",
    "little - parks oscillation is a periodic variation of @xmath2 with a magnetic field by the superconducting fluxoid quantization .",
    "@xcite especially when temperature is near @xmath2 , phase coherence of the order parameter is stretched over the whole system .",
    "hence variation of @xmath2 is affected by vortex configuration .",
    "experimentally little - parks oscillation of @xmath2 can be observed as a periodic variation of resistance with a magnetic field at fixed temperature , which was taken near the midpoint of normal - to - superconducting transition .",
    "we measured little - parks oscillation of these samples by using @xmath10 hz four terminal ac resistance bridge with excitation voltage @xmath11 @xmath4v .",
    "moreover the spectral analysis was performed by maximum entropy method ( mem ) to explore other periods .",
    "first the monolayer network was investigated .",
    "the inset of fig . [ fig2](b ) present temperature dependence of the sample resistance normalized by @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath2 was observed at around 7.2 k. this value good agrees with @xmath2 of bulk lead .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) shows the magnetic flux dependence of the normalized resistance in range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and @xmath14 to @xmath11 g. we found periodic dips indicated by the arrows .",
    "figure [ fig2](c ) exhibits the index number of dip positions as a function of the magnetic flux .",
    "the slope shows period of oscillation as @xmath15 g. the area estimated from the period is @xmath16 @xmath4m@xmath17 and correspond to a hexagonal unit cell enclosed by center of the wire of the network .",
    "this value compares well to the value @xmath18 @xmath4m@xmath17 obtained from sem observation with @xmath19 @xmath20 accuracy .",
    "thus the period correspond to one - flux quantum @xmath21 per unit cell .",
    "+ on the other hand , a different period of oscillation was obtained in the case of the bilayer network . figure [ fig3](a ) shows temperature dependence of the normalized resistance . @xmath2",
    "was observed at around 4.3 k less than 7.2 k. this reduction of @xmath2 demonstrates that the proximity effect is well induced in the bilayer network .",
    "@xcite figure [ fig3](b ) denotes the magnetic flux dependence of the normalized resistance .",
    "periodic dips indicated by the arrows were found .",
    "the slope of the line is @xmath22 g as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the area estimated from the period is @xmath23 @xmath4m@xmath17 and correspond to a hexagonal unit cell enclosed by edge of the wire , not center of the wire of the network .",
    "this value compares well to the value @xmath24 @xmath4m@xmath17 obtained from sem observation with @xmath25 @xmath20 accuracy .",
    "hence the area of vortex is found to be different from the case of the monolayer network although both the networks have the same honeycomb design . in this case , the amplitude of the order parameter could be changed along the width direction because the proximity effect modifies the superconducting parameter of the pb - au bilayer in terms of the coherence length , the penetration depth , and the extrapolation length.@xcite moreover the normal component of the carriers could be more effective because gold as the normal metal was joined with the superconductor .",
    "in addition , superconductivity is weakened in the edge of the wire .",
    "+ spectrum analysis was performed by mem in order to explore the network effects .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) presents the power spectrum in the case of the monolayer network and total results are summarized in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "the fundamental peak labeled as @xmath26 correspond to a period of 2.11 g and is consistent with the previous result of @xmath15 g. the corresponding area @xmath27 is @xmath28 @xmath4m@xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the second strongest peak of @xmath29 g labeled as @xmath30 and the third one of @xmath31 g as @xmath32 are observed .",
    "the corresponding area of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 @xmath4m@xmath17 and @xmath36 @xmath4m@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "an area ratio is connected to the filling ratio of vortex @xmath37 which is the magnetic flux @xmath38 in units of the flux quantum @xmath39 per unit cell .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are found to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "especially , since @xmath40 is close to 3 , the period of @xmath30 corresponds to the downward cusp in the magnetic field response at @xmath44 in the recent report .",
    "@xcite thus these peaks are attributed to the effect of the honeycomb network .",
    "+ in the case of the bilayer network , several peaks were also observed as shown in fig . [ fig4](b ) .",
    "the fundamental peak as @xmath45 correspond to a period of 2.71 g and is consistent with the previous result of @xmath22 g. the corresponding area @xmath46 is @xmath47 @xmath4m@xmath17 .",
    "the second strongest peak labeled as @xmath48 and the third one as @xmath49 correspond to a period of @xmath50 and @xmath51 g , respectively .",
    "the corresponding areas of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath52 @xmath4m@xmath17 and @xmath53 @xmath4m@xmath17 .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 and @xmath55 are found to be @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are obviously different from the case of the monolayer network .",
    "therefore these results indicate realization of a novel network attributed to the proximity effect . + now let us discuss vortex configuration on these networks at each peak . in the case of the monolayer network , vortices are commensurately arranged with its base structure at rational @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 and @xmath59 are geometrically expected as 3 and 3/2 because of the honeycomb network .",
    "therefore vortex configuration at @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath26 peak , @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath30 peak , and @xmath61 corresponding to @xmath32 peak are constructed as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , [ fig5](b ) , and [ fig5](c ) , respectively .",
    "the unit cells occupied by vortices are shown shaded .",
    "the dashed line denotes path through which the superconducting current flows . at @xmath26 peak ,",
    "vortices are placed in all unit cells enclosed by center of the wire . at @xmath30 peak",
    ", one vortex is allocated in every three unit cells .",
    "this pattern is commensurately matched with the underlying honeycomb lattice and energetically stable over the whole system . in the same way ,",
    "stable vortex configuration is constructed at @xmath32 peak .",
    "this pattern could be attributed to an effect of the sample edge to keep hexagonal symmetry in addition to the network effect since our network was finite .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the case of the bilayer network , vortex configuration is not simply constructed . at @xmath45 peak , vortices are placed in all unit cells enclosed by edge of the wire as shown in fig . [ fig5](d ) . for @xmath48 and @xmath49 peak ,",
    "their vortex configuration is not constructed soon .",
    "the area ratios of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are geometrically expected as 3 and 3/2 in the same way with the case of the monolayer network .",
    "but the experimental values are far from the geometrically expected values .",
    "+ surprisingly , we found a factor associated with the line width in the ratio of @xmath54 and @xmath55 [ see table [ table2 ] ] .",
    "the ratio of @xmath62 , which means the ratio of area enclosed by edge of the wire and center of the wire , is around @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath54is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the 3.11 is very close to @xmath40 of 3.15 .",
    "furthermore @xmath55 is calculated as @xmath65 .",
    "the 1.48 nearly equal to @xmath41 of 1.49 . that is",
    ", the area ratio of the bilayer network is found to consist of two parts .",
    "one is the area ratio of the monolayer network , the other the factor of the line width .",
    "these relations suggest that the feature of the monolayer network could appear even in the bilayer network",
    ". therefore vortex configuration at the magnetic flux corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath49 peak are speculated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "vortices are arranged in an analogous way with the monolayer network and the path of superconducting current is enclosed by edge of the wire .",
