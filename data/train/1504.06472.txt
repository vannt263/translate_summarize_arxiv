    "in the standard approach to galactic cr propagation , the @xmath74-particle phase space distribution of crs is approximated as a macroscopic fluid . solving then the diffusion equation including cr interactions permits to model self - consistently primary and secondary fluxes .",
    "however , the diffusion approach has several disadvantages .",
    "first of all , the diffusion approximation itself breaks down in several interesting regimes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the diffusion tensor is an external input in this approach .",
    "it is only loosely connected to fundamental properties of the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) . in this work ,",
    "we apply therefore the trajectory approach where one calculates the path of individual crs solving the equations of motion of particles propagating in the gmf .",
    "we use the code described and tested in  @xcite , while we use for the regular and the turbulent component of the gmf the parameters described in @xcite . as we showed previously in @xcite ,",
    "the resulting cr fluxes reproduce over a wide range of energies all available experimental data for individual groups of cr nuclei .",
    "our numerical results for the propagation of crs emitted by a bursting source can be summarized as follows . in an initial period ,",
    "crs propagate essentially one - dimensional , filling a filament - like structure around the magnetic field line going through the source .",
    "after this rather short initial period , crs start to diffuse also perpendicular to the direction of the filament . in a realistic gmf model ,",
    "the two perpendicular components of the diffusion tensor differ , @xmath75 , and thus crs diffuse mainly in the @xmath76 and the @xmath77 direction . in particular , we found for the case at hand in the jansson - farrar model  @xcite the values @xmath78@xmath40/s for crs with energy @xmath79tev .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] which shows the scaled cr density @xmath80 at the position of the earth as function of time for three different energies .",
    "additionally , we used the relation @xmath81 valid for kolmogorov turbulence to rescale the @xmath82ev curve by @xmath83 to @xmath84ev and to @xmath85ev .",
    "the approximate agreement of the two rescaled curves with the true result supports a kolmogorov - like scaling of the density .",
    "moreover , it is visible that the density scales approximately as @xmath86 for intermediates times , 10kyr@xmath87myr .",
    "such a scaling is characteristic for two - dimensional diffusion and reflects the observed hierarchy in the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor .     of crs at the position of the earth as function of time for three different energies ; also shown are the densities rescaled using @xmath88 ( grey lines ) and the @xmath89 behavior expected for @xmath90 diffusion . ]",
    "the trajectories of charged crs depend on their rigidity @xmath91 .",
    "the sign difference of the charge of protons and antiprotons becomes important only on distances of a few coherence lengths to the source , while on larger scales the diffusion of protons and antiprotons of the same energy proceeds in the same way . in this paper",
    "we do not perform the full ( computationally expansive ) calculation of trajectories of the secondary particles . instead , we use a scaling relation to describe the spread of the secondaries , taking into account the shift of energy of the secondaries compared to the primary particles .",
    "the density @xmath92 of antiprotons which are produced at the time @xmath93 by protons with the density @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the green function describing the diffusion of antiprotons .",
    "our numerical results show that the cr propagation from a bursting source can be modeled by two - dimensional diffusion in the time and energy range of interest for cr secondary production .",
    "thus the proton density at the production time @xmath93 is given by @xmath97 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath98 denotes the distance in the two - dimensional diffusion plane , @xmath99 the source spectrum and @xmath100 the effective diffusion distance , @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding green function @xmath102 has the same functional form , @xmath103\\ ] ] with @xmath104 . for simplicity , we assume a one - to - one relation between the energy of protons and antiprotons , setting @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "this results in the diffusion coefficient @xmath107 for kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) is of the standard gaussian type . in the limit of small @xmath98",
    "the exponent is @xmath108\\sim 1 $ ] and the ratio @xmath109 is @xmath110 where we introduced also @xmath111 . in particular , we see that the ratio does not depend on energy and satisfies as required @xmath112 .",
    "integrating over the production time @xmath93 , we find @xmath113 for @xmath106 .",
    "thus , using for cr antiprotons the primary proton trajectories we underestimate the antiproton flux by @xmath114% . since this enhancement is energy independent , we can use the following scheme for the calculation of the antiproton flux .    in a first step ,",
    "we calculate the proton flux at the position of the earth neglecting interactions . in the trajectory approach ,",
    "we obtain the local cr flux at a given time interval recording the path length of crs spent in a sphere around this point .",
    "we record also the grammage @xmath37 these crs crossed on their way to the earth .",
    "then we calculate the average grammage @xmath115 summing up the gas density along the trajectories of the @xmath74 individual crs .",
    "we employ @xmath116 as model for the gas distribution in the galactic disk , with @xmath117 as the distance to the galactic plane , @xmath118@xmath48 at the solar position and @xmath119kpc  @xcite .",
    "we set also @xmath120g/@xmath48 as minimum gas density up to the edge of the milky way at @xmath121kpc .",
    "next we calculate the secondary antiprotons produced by crs interacting with gas using the modified version of qgsjet - ii-04 introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the antiproton flux is then given by @xmath122 where the @xmath53-factor is given by the inclusive spectra of antiprotons @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 with @xmath126 as the average slope of the proton spectrum .",
    "the factor @xmath127 accounts for the underestimate of the antiproton flux , while we include the effect of heavier nuclei in the interstellar medium using a nuclear enhancement factor @xmath128 .",
    "note that it is a virtue of our model that the slope of the injection spectrum is the same for all cr nuclei . as a result",
    ", the use of a nuclear enhancement factor is justified .",
    "the same approach could be applied also to positrons , with a change @xmath129 to take into account their lower average energy .",
    "the above simple picture has to be modified at the highest energies ( beyond the current measurements energy range ) where continuous energy losses of positrons become important .",

    "the effective diffusion coefficient for this solution is @xmath134 as determined from our simulations . for a fixed value of @xmath135 ,",
    "this determines the electron and positron spectra formed at time @xmath93 .",
    "the total electron and positron fluxes are then obtained summing over the formation time .",
    "this approximation has to be verified by simulations of trajectories of secondary positrons taking into account continuous energy losses .",

    "<S> a characteristic feature of secondary production in hadronic interactions is that the slope of the energy spectrum of secondaries is very close to the one of the parent protons , since scaling violations are small except close to mass thresholds . </S>",

    "<S> both the normalisation and the slope @xmath43 agree well with the experimental data .    </S>",

    "<S> the synchrotron and inverse compton cooling softens the positron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the primary crs , which are injected instantaneously from a point source , positrons are continuously produced at a constant rate . </S>",

    "<S> otherwise , if the source would be much more recent , crs would not have enough time to produce the observed excess positron flux .    </S>",

    "<S> the apparent independence of the @xmath57 ratio with energy is at tension with the naive expectation that in the steady state model of secondary antiproton production by cr interactions in the ism the antiproton spectrum should be softer than the proton spectrum , so that the ratio should have decreasing trend with the increase of energy @xcite . </S>",
