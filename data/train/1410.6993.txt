    "gene activation and deactivation are at the base of the dynamics of transcriptional networks . however , it is only after the pioneering investigations by ko @xcite and by kepler and elston @xcite that their fundamental role in shaping the dynamics of such networks is starting being understood @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the effect of _ realistic extrinsic noises _ acting on the gene deactivation mechanism in a basic network motif - the positive feedback of a transcription factor on its own synthesis - under different scenarios .",
    "more precisely , we consider the case of different cellular types hosting the network , the presence of different amounts of proteins , and various properties of the external perturbations .",
    "however simple ( and at large extent idealised ) it may be , yet this biological model summarises some of the key concepts in systems biology : _ nonlinearity _ , _ multi - stability _",
    "@xcite ( whose relevance to model induction phenomena and cellular differentiation @xcite was first stressed in the sixties @xcite ) , feedback mechanisms @xcite , _ stochasticity _ - both in intrinsic and extrinsic form - and the above mentioned key role of gene switching dynamics . the problem we study is also inherently _ multi - scale _ , being characterised by at least three different temporal and numerical scales : the slow / fast gene switching rates , the small / large number of copies of the transcription factor - this , for instance , is characteristic of eukaryotic cells or bacteria - and the small / large autocorrelation times of the extrinsic noise .",
    "the first two scales are present also in the baseline case of isolated network , i.e. , in the absence of extrinsic noise , and play an essential role in determining the dynamics of the unperturbed system , as previously stressed @xcite .",
    "the third scale is specifically introduced by the inclusion of bounded coloured perturbations @xcite .    from the complex interplay of all these scales , it is not surprising that the very same biological network might behave quite differently . in other words ,",
    "the transcriptional circuitry is only a part of the biological phenomenon , which emerges both from the motif itself and the particular combination of considered scales .    in order to fully appreciate the role of gene switching in modulating the dynamics of genetic networks , we provide an example taken from @xcite .",
    "namely , it is generally thought that a transcriptional network where a large number of proteins and mrnas are observed can be modelled with differential equations , in the idealised case of absent extrinsic noise . on the contrary , stochastic",
    "fluctuations - sometimes very large - can be predicted if the rate of switching of at least one of the genes involved in the network is slow , with respect to the characteristic times of the remaining part of the circuit .",
    "thus , this phenomenon is one of the leading cause of stochasticity in genetic networks , as stressed by elston and kepler in @xcite and by lipniacki and colleagues @xcite .",
    "this previously unaccounted stochasticity interplays with the nonlinearity of genetic networks and , sometimes , may induce new emergente behaviours able to explain experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned absence of extrinsic noises is a high level abstraction , even when stochasticity induced by genes switching between their `` on '' and `` off '' states is considered ( i.e. , an `` internal '' phenomenon ) .",
    "this abstraction is useful to establish relevant baseline behaviours , but is scarcely realistic . indeed , no network is so isolated to always neglect its interplay with all the other intracellular networks , as well as its interactions with signals coming from the extracellular word .",
    "thus , we believe that a crucial step towards a better understanding of genetic networks is the inclusion of extrinsic stochastic noises , so to investigate the networks response to various perturbations .    however , modelling extrinsic perturbations and their effects is by no means trivial . in the past",
    ", external stochastic effects were often considered disturbances obfuscating a real signal , to be biologically controlled by those pathways working as a low - pass analog filter , as in radiophysics @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", a number of theoretical and experimental investigations focused on the existence of noise - reducing sub - networks @xcite .",
    "thinking of noises as pure nuisances , as traditionally meant in telecommunication engineering , requires careful considerations .",
    "indeed , in such a case a perturbed monostable network should exhibit fluctuations around a unique deterministic equilibrium .",
    "however , non - equilibrium statistical and chemical physics showed that the real scenario is far more complex .",
    "indeed , in the seventies horsthemke and lefever seriously challenged the above mentioned mono - stability / mono - modality correspondence .",
    "they succeeded in showing that , in many cases , nonlinear systems monostable in absence of external noises exhibit multimodal equilibrium probability densities , in presence of random gaussian disturbances @xcite .",
    "they termed these `` noise - induced - transitions '' , a phenomenon shown to be relevant also to bio - molecular networks @xcite .",
    "in other words , the concentration of the chemicals in a network undergoing such transitions can stochastically fluctuate around more than one point in the phase space .    besides extrinsic noises , experimental studies evidenced the importance of internal stochastic effects on many important biomolecular networks when transcription factors , and/or proteins and/or mrnas are present in a small number of copies @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that rna production is not continuous , but instead it has the characteristics of _ stochastic bursts _ @xcite .",
    "thus , a number of investigations has focused on this internal , i.e. _ intrinsic _ , form of stochasticity , often termed `` intrinsic noise '' @xcite .",
    "it was shown - both theoretically and experimentally - that also this form of randomness might induce multi - modality in the probability distribution of chemicals @xcite .    the potential of exploiting internal and external noises to fluctuate around points that are non - equilibrium when noise is absent , as well as to switch from an equilibrium to another , are not just a mathematical curiosity , as they can be biologically functional ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for example",
    ", this might allow a network to reach biochemical `` equilibrium '' configurations otherwise unaccessible @xcite .",
    "phenotype variability in cellular populations is , for example , probably the most important macroscopic effect of intracellular noise - induced phenomena @xcite .",
    "some body of research has been devoted to investigations concerning the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic forms of stochasticity . from a modelling perspective swain and",
    "coworkers stressed many important effects , although without observing emergent multi - modal phenomena , in @xcite .",
    "the above study is remarkable since : @xmath0 it has outlined the role of noise autocorrelation , @xmath1 it has stressed what anticipated above , namely that unbounded noises may induce artefacts with no sense in a biological setting , e.g. , negative kinetic parameters .",
    "thus , extrinsic bounded noises seem and adequate tool to model extrinsic perturbations , in biochemical settings",
    ". motivated by some biological examples , intrinsically stochastic models of nonlinear networks where combined with such noises in @xcite . in that case , the chemical reaction rates were perturbed by coloured bounded extrinsic noises modelled by biochemical state - dependent systems of stochastic differential equations .",
    "concerning the parameters to model noise , besides autocorrelation , both amplitude and stationary probability density of the noise are of the utmost importance .",
    "indeed , the literature has shown that various stochasticity - induced phenomena may vary as a function of these noise features @xcite and , thus , without experimental information on the stochastic fluctuations for the problem in study , a theoretical work must deal with various models of noise .",
    "the analysis of the behaviour of our simple biological multi - scale model is by no means trivial .",
    "as we shall see in the next , from the combination of the various scales characterising the network , various modelling approaches will be adopted , leading to different scenarios never studied before .",
    "in fact , the simplest case of large number of proteins and absence of extrinsic influences , when deterministic network models can be adopted , was already studied by griffith @xcite and later by thomas and dari @xcite , by means of boolean networks . in both cases the hypothesis of absence of a baseline activation rate was assumed .",
    "more recently , this constraint has been relaxed by smolen , baxter and byrne @xcite .",
    "their model was employed to investigate the differentiation of wb15-m cells in response to bmp2 stimulation by wang _",
    "_ in the theoretical / experimental paper @xcite . quite interestingly",
    ", bimodal behaviour of cellular differentiation obtained in the experimental part of @xcite were reproduced by means of impulsive random changes of the transcription factor level . in a follow - up ,",
    "smolen , baxter and byrne considered the role of intrinsic noise and other important transport - induced phenomena in this transcriptional circuit @xcite .",
    "analytical investigations of the effects of _ intrinsic _ stochasticity were recently investigated by employing of the classical white - noise - based chemical langevin equations and its innovative coloured - noise - based version @xcite .",
    "this approach allowed researchers to propose important inferences on the effect of such a noise in the process of cellular differentiation @xcite , and on the dynamics of lactose @xcite . in the framework of continuous approximation of protein concentration ,",
    "the effects of extrinsic white noises on protein production have been studied by @xcite and @xcite , in a biological setting partially unclear . for the sake of comparison , in sm we provide a detailed commentary of these two papers .",
    "to conclude , the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic unbounded noise affecting protein production in a self - transcription network with sharp and smooth positive feedback has been considered by assaf _",
    "_ @xcite . in there , the biological setting ( i.e. , unbounded and state - dependent perturbation of protein production when the genes are `` on '' in absence of gene - switching ) is substantially different from ours ( i.e. , bounded perturbation of the gene - deactivation dynamics ) , as we comment in sm .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  [ sec : model ] we introduce the network motif and our modelling approach according to the considered scales .",
    "then , in  [ sec : network ] , we describe and comment simulations . concluding remarks , including some future perspective derived by our numerical analysis , close this work . in supplementary materials we provide the necessary background on the mathematical definition of bounded noises and analytical calculations used to derive the the parameters settings used thorough the analysis .",
    "we consider a simple transcriptional network constituting of a gene @xmath2 and its protein product , a transcription factor with positive feedback on its own gene .",
    "specifically , here we assume that the deactivation rate of the gene is under the influence of bounded extrinsic perturbations ( figure [ fig : network ] , left ) .",
    "the protein numbers will be denoted as @xmath3 , and its concentration as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cell volume and @xmath6 avogadro s number .",
    "usually , one assumes the transcription factor to be produced by @xmath7 copies of @xmath2 .",
    "however , in pathological cases more / less copies of @xmath2 might be needed : e.g. , due to gene deletions it may be @xmath8 @xcite , while in tumour cells it may be @xmath9 , due to genetic amplification @xcite . in the applications , we set @xmath7 .    in the above network a single gene copy could be _ active _ , i.e. producing its transcript with rate @xmath10 , or _",
    "silent _ , so at each time instant we model the gene as a binary variable @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the transcript protein positively feedbacks on its own production , thus proteins do not act in the process of gene deactivation .",
    "we denote as @xmath12 and @xmath13 the , respectively , activation and deactivation rates of the gene , while the protein degradation rate is @xmath14 ( figure [ fig : network ] , left ) .",
    "thus the positive feedback is modelled with an additive term in activation rate @xmath15 , and @xmath13 and @xmath16 are the baseline rates of deactivation and activation .",
    "extrinsic perturbations affect @xmath13 , yielding a time - varying deactivation rate : @xmath17\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the average value of the deactivation rate and @xmath19 is a _ bounded noise _ such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "every noise is characterized by an amplitude , @xmath22 $ ] , and an autocorrelation time , @xmath23 ; see the supplementary materials ( sm ) for a detailed description of the two types of bounded noises that we consider in this work .",
    "roughly , @xmath24 and @xmath25 define the noise intensity and its speed in changing value . from a modelling perspective",
    ", we consider noise as an abstract representation of the possible unknown interactions of the network with its environment .",
    "for instance , when @xmath19 has an oscillatory effect on @xmath18 we are abstractly modelling a certain protein synthesized in an oscillatory regime , which competes with the protein @xmath3 making its deactivation rates oscillate . in principle , though noises can affect all the network components , we restrict our analysis to the effects on deactivation , since an exhaustive characterization of the noise effects is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , models of a network similar to the one we consider here were previously studied .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the case of deterministic modelling was considered , while in @xcite intrinsic stochastic effects were included . in addiction , the effects of unbounded white / coloured gaussian noises modelling biological mechanisms not clearly defined were investigated in @xcite ( see detailed comments in the sm ) .",
    "the model of noise used in those studies - i.e. , unbounded - is nowadays considered inappropriate in the context of biological systems , see , e.g.,@xcite . bounded noises , instead , which seem to be much more suitable , are used hereby to model a clear biological phenomenon . in this paper",
    "we consider the network of figure [ fig : network ] in four different experimental settings emerging from two , out of the three possible , scales mentioned in the introduction , namely : @xmath0 _ the slow , respectively fast , velocity of gene on - off switching _ and @xmath1 _ the small , respectively large , number of proteins involved_. then , in each of those settings we will assess the network response to extrinsic bounded noise .",
    "this makes the network a simple - but powerful - _ multi - scale _ system where both temporal and numerical scales coexist . to the best of our knowledge , a combination of different experimental settings and bounded extrinsic noises acting on the gene deactivation mechanism",
    "was not studied before .",
    "mathematics provide us a framework for _ exact modelling _ of the above network , which is based on the idea of counting explicitly the number of proteins and states of the genes in the network @xcite .",
    "such a framework is , by its constituting ingredients , unaware of the underlying physical hypothesis on the involved number of proteins .",
    "more precisely , it assumes that numerical and temporal scales are somehow similar , a fact which is hard to guarantee in a general setting as the one studied here .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to known _ scalability issues _ which emerge when that framework is used , e.g. , to model a multi - scale system as the one above .",
    "pragmatically , an exhaustive analysis of an exact model might turn out to be impractical , both at the level of the state - space , which might be too large to sample many initial conditions , or even more dramatically at the level of the single network simulation .",
    "however , the different settings allow us to use approximated mathematical representations of the network , sometimes dropping precision for complexity of the model analysis . on one side ,",
    "this drawback is anyway unavoidable , as suggested by the lot of efforts in developing efficient techniques for model analysis . on the other side ,",
    "this is methodologically correct , being the result of applying careful mathematical considerations on the physics of the network itself .    our study , which includes four distinct modelling scenarios , is in line with the recent important work by jaruszewicz _ et al .",
    "@xcite , with the noteworthy exception that in that paper a noise - free setting and a single - gene network were considered .",
    "we remark that including noises does not allow much analytical investigation of the network , as instead was possible in @xcite . the modelling techniques that we employ in the next sections",
    "are , in order of decreasing complexity :    * _ slow gene switching and small number of copies of the protein _",
    ", which requires us to _ account explicitly for all the copies of genes / proteins _ via a pure continuous - time markov chain ( ctmc ) representation of the network - augmented with bounded noises - as defined in @xcite .",
    "we present it in  [ sec : model ] model a. this is the exact representation of the network and , as anticipated , it can be efficiently analyzed only when a few hundreds of proteins are present and the time - scales of the involved events are similar ; * _ fast gene switching velocity and small number of protein copies _ , which allows us to make a _ steady - state hypothesis on the gene dynamics_. this model is mathematically similar to model a ( with slow gene switching and small number of copies of the protein ) , but counting exactly solely the proteins .",
    "we present it in  [ sec : model ] model b. this first approximation of the exact model is necessary since , if we were here to model explicitly the gene - switching process , most of the simulation time would be spent in modelling gene s activation / deactivation , downgrading the overall performance ; * _ slow gene switching velocity and large number of protein copies _ , which leads to a _ steady - state hypothesis on the protein concentration_. in this model",
    "the gene state @xmath26 is a stochastic process ( as in model a ) , whereas the dynamics of the proteins is approximated via a differential equation driven by @xmath26 .",
    "in other words the model ( which is hybrid because involves a stochastic process and a differential equation ) is a classical piecewise - deterministic markov process @xcite , augmented with noise .",
    "we present it in  [ sec : model ] model c. in this case , possible deadlocks emerging when simulating thousands of proteins in a ctmc representation are avoided ; * _ fast gene switching velocity and large number of protein copies _ , which allows us to model the network with coupled differential equations , plus extrinsic noise , constituting the model presented in ",
    "[ sec : model ] model d. in this case , if we were to use the ctmc representation , deadlocks would surely emerge in simulating the model , making its analysis unfeasible .    in general",
    ", these approaches result is a series of models of decreasing complexity both in terms of mathematical representation and cost of simulation . in the following ,",
    "we describe each of the models outlined above .          here",
    "we study the network when the switching rate of the genes is slow and the number of molecules of the transcription factor is small .",
    "let the state of the system be @xmath27 .",
    "each state @xmath28 is characterized by a jump rate defined by the following _ time - inhomogeneous birth - death process_.    the events of the model are described in table [ table : modela ] , where we used the notation @xmath29 to denote that the event increase by one the number of @xmath2 in the time interval @xmath30 , i.e. an `` off '' gene becomes `` on '' .",
    "similarly , @xmath31 models a protein degradation with rate @xmath14 .    here @xmath2 and",

    "event , i.e. , via @xmath32 which contains the noise term @xmath19 .",
    "because of this the jump equation to generate a simulation is to be solved numerically , as discussed in @xcite . if @xmath33 , standard algorithms could have been used to simulate the embedded ctmc , e.g. @xcite , which would have been time - homogeneous since @xmath34 . note that , since the gene deactivation rate must be strictly positive , in this and in the following three models it is impossible to represent the extrinsic noise by means of a gaussian ( or non - gaussian ) unbounded noise .    .*model a : slow gene switching and small number of proteins . *",

    "i.e. @xmath34 , so model d is in its multi - stability region .",
    "note that based on the data given in @xcite one can not identify all the original parameters .",
    "thus , we start our investigation in the biological setting of fast gene switching and large number of protein copies ( in  [ sec : model ] model d ) , which , in absence and - to some extent - in presence of extrinsic bounded perturbations can be analytically studied ( see sm ) .",
    "we set @xmath42 so that @xmath43 . for this value of @xmath13",
    "the system is multistable and has two stable equilibria at @xmath44 , @xmath45 and one unstable equilibrium at @xmath46 . by assuming @xmath13 as a bifurcation variable",
    ", one gets a classical hysteresis bifurcation parameter shown in figure [ fullydetdia ] @xmath47-@xmath48 , where one can see that the system is bistable for @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , three main factors may influence the biological response to extrinsic noise , all of which we will be scrutinised in the forthcoming simulations .",
    "these are : @xmath0 the noise model , which here we restrict to the sine - wiener and the cai - lin cases ( see sm and , e.g. , @xcite ) ; @xmath1 the noise amplitude @xmath24 ; @xmath52 the noise autocorrelation time @xmath25 , which is also relevant for unbounded noises ( see the ornestein - uhlenbeck noise in @xcite ) .",
    "in the following we will illustrate some numerical simulations of the stationary _ probability density function _ of the number ( or of the concentration ) of proteins , denoted as @xmath53 , as well as of derived summary statistics such as the average stationary value of @xmath3 , @xmath54 , and of its standard deviation , @xmath55 .",
    "of course , in numerical simulations one can only measure an heuristic probability @xmath56 at a large time @xmath57 which must be far larger than the characteristic times of the network in study , in order to result @xmath58 .",
    "of course , @xmath57 must also be smaller than the average lifespan of the host organism . throughout our study",
    "we set @xmath59 .",
    "thus the adherence of the measured heuristic density @xmath60 to @xmath61 ultimately depends on the velocity of convergence of the density to its stationary value .",
    "in sm we developed an analytical study of the transient probability density of the number of proteins at time @xmath62 , denoted @xmath63 .",
    "the key result of this analysis is that if @xmath64 , i.e. , the initial number of proteins available at time @xmath65 , belongs to the basin of attraction of the low equilibrium then for small ( but not infinitesimal ) values of @xmath24 , which is the noise intensity , @xmath66 remains small , for intermediate values of @xmath24 @xmath66 can undergo a jump towards the large values and this jump is _ irreversible _",
    "( if @xmath24 remains constant ) . finally , if @xmath24 is sufficiently large , then @xmath66 can stochastically oscillate from low to large values and vice versa .",
    "similar scenario is predicted if @xmath64 is large .",
    "this mathematical analysis suggests that , assessing the influence of the noise amplitude on the stationary average @xmath67 value of @xmath68 , one should observe - for increasing @xmath24 - before a fist - order phase transition @xcite , i.e. a sudden increase of the average value @xmath69 accompanied , in the transition point , by a sudden widening of the standard deviation @xmath70 , and then a second order phase transition , i.e. a smooth decrease of @xmath71 accompanied , in the transition point , by a widening of the observed @xmath70 .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions : a first order transition , between high and low protein densities , at @xmath72 and a second order one , between high protein density and an oscillating behaviour at @xmath73 , as shown in figure [ fullydetdia ] @xmath48 we compare the statistical summaries ( order parameters ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 against @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for both sine - wiener and cai - lin noises . if @xmath76 the equilibrium distribution is unimodal and peaked on the high or low protein level , depending on the initial number of proteins , i.e. the basins of attraction for high and low protein level are separated by the unstable fixed point , see panel @xmath47 .",

    "results suggest that , in general , the gene switching velocity is the key parameter to modulate the response of the network to such perturbations .",
    "furthermore , in the case of small number of proteins , another parameter which predicts different responses is cellular volume , which suggest that the very same network might exhibit different quantitative behaviours according to the considered cell type .",
    "concerning extrinsic noises , quite surprisingly simulations suggest that little can be imputed to the particular stationary distribution of the noise itself , e.g. , horned versus bell - like . instead",
    ", noise amplitude - which models how strong is the effect of the perturbation on the gene deactivation rate - induces a cascade of phase transitions : from first to second order , at least when gene switching is fast and a very large number of proteins is present .",
    "the same behaviour is observed even when few proteins are present provided cellular volume is large .    when gene switching is fast , and many proteins are present , the first order transition becomes irreversible , i.e. once the protein concentration switches from low to high values , there is no backward switch unless noise amplitude is further increased .",
    "conversely , when the gene switching is slow , no fist - order transitions were observed .",
    "the autocorrelation time characteristic of the extrinsic noise was studied , mimicking the presence of inhibiting proteins competing for the same transcription sites of the gene , and synthesised at different velocities .",
    "apparently , autocorrelation affects solely the second order ( smooth ) transitions by amplifying the probability to observe few proteins .     the bounded - noise - induced _",
    "irreversible _ first order transitions among low and large protein levels of the transcription factor could be cautiously read as a mechanism , employed by bi - potent cells where the factor is abundant and the gene switching is very fast , for the choice of a _ permanent _ cellular fate .",
    "indeed , for these cells the fate choice induced by the presence of intrinsic noise is missing , whereas , on the contrary , unbounded noises would in any case induce stochastic oscillations of the protein concentration ( taken apart , for the sake of the discussion , the issues of biological realism ) .",
    "heterogeneity of fates in a population of such cells might thus be originated by considering the amplitude of the noise as a `` static '' random variable .",
    "of course , these inferences are quite speculative and they need further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "more in general , it is important to stress that the model here proposed is quite abstract and generic . in particular",
    ", a more realistic description of the gene - switching process might lead to biological predictions of interest .",
    "for instance , our model neglects some important macroscopic features : mrnas are not considered , spatial effects @xcite are missing - which were instead stressed as important for the motif in study since the seminal paper @xcite - and other issues .    as far as future investigations are concerned , we remind that we focused on a region of parameter values that induces bistability in the deterministic case , in order to outline the possible peculiar effects of extrinsic noise . of some interest would be , instead , a more canonical investigation of the parametric regions inducing monostability in the deterministic model . such an analysis would allow to verify whether extrinsic bounded noises acting on the gene deactivation rate induce bimodality in the protein distribution , and the role of the noise autocorrelation times .",
    "all of the above considerations depict a complex scenario , and motivate at least three , more substantial , issues worth of further investigations .",
    "the first concerns the behaviour of the network in the context of cycling cells : indeed , since in the case of few proteins cellular volume plays a relevant role , it is natural to ask what might happen in cycling cells when this parameter varies in time , due to mitosis .",
    "the second issue is related to the dichotomy between physiological and abnormal cells .",
    "here we investigated normal cells where the number of gene is conserved through time , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "abnormal cells , which might be constituted of more / less copies of the gene , might allow to observe phase transitions which are unobservable when @xmath7 .",
    "along this line , first order transition might be observed , if @xmath125 is sufficiently large ( i.e. , gene amplification ) , and a mean field behaviour of gene switching could emerge , also when this process is slow .",
    "a positive answer to this question might lead to further investigations on the correlation of this phenomena with proteins which are over - expressed in cancer cells .",
    "finally , experimental evidences showed that the `` on - off '' two - states gene switching is often an oversimplification @xcite .",
    "exploring multi - state and more complex mechanisms of gene dynamics is thus an important further issue .",
    "the introduction of such mechanisms might lead to an additional variability , similar to those we hypothesise for gene amplification .",

    "in this section we comment three previous models of the self - activation transcriptional network motif that investigated the role of extrinsic gaussian noises , either alone @xcite or in combination with intrinsic fluctuations ( but without gene - switching noise ) @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned in the main text , model d in absence of extrinsic noise reads as follows : @xmath126 but , in the literature , e.g. , @xcite , it is often written in the algebraically equivalent form @xmath127 where @xmath128 and the sum @xmath129 can be , respectively , legitimately read as a baseline and an `` asymptotic '' production rates . however , since it holds that @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 it follows that the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 must not be dealt with as they were independent .",
    "in particular , a fluctuation of the baseline rate @xmath128 can not be deconvolved by fluctuations in the other two parameters .",
    "unfortunately this is what happens in literature .",
    "for example , in @xcite the smolen - baxter - byrne model was studied in the framework of the above mentioned continuous approximation with fast gene - switching and large number of proteins .",
    "the authors of @xcite analytically investigated the consequences of white stochastic oscillations affecting the baseline production rate @xmath135 and/or the parameter @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the model in @xcite reads as follows @xmath136    unfortunately , according to what we above showed , the stochastic differential equation ( [ sbbphysa ] ) does not correspond to a biologically meaningful scenario , unless both @xmath137 and , of course , the noises are bounded .",
    "we note here that , in such a particular case , eq . @xcite can be read as a model of fluctuations in the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "in @xcite it is investigated a model where both the baseline protein production rate and the degradation rate were perturbed by white noises , yielding the following stochastic differential equation @xmath138 again , isolated oscillations of the parameter @xmath128 are not meaningful .    as briefly mentioned in the introduction , by means of semi - analytical methods , joining the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation and numerical simulations , assaf and colleagues recently investigated the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic noise in the circuit of a self - transcription factor with a sharp positive feedback @xcite .",
    "the biological differences between their model and ours are worth to be described in some detail .",
    "indeed , in their main model the extrinsic noise perturbs the production rate of the transcription factor , and the perturbation is state - dependent being active only if the state of the protein is `` high '' . indeed , under the implicit hypothesis that the gene switching velocity is large they assume the following probability law for the production of the transcription factor in the time interval @xmath30 @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the heavyside function and @xmath141 .",
    "thus if @xmath142 is under the threshold then the production rate of the transcription factor is unperturbed .",
    "the mechanism through which this state - dependent fluctuation of the production rate can be enacted is not specified . in absence of such specification ,",
    "the asymmetry of the perturbation acting on the baseline and on the large protein synthesis rates remains unclear .",
    "note that in @xcite it is also briefly investigated a model where a smooth feedback is enacted ( as in the smolen - baxter - byrne model @xcite ) : @xmath143 thus , the perturbation adopted in @xcite for such a smooth case is equivalent to the perturbation of the parameter @xmath133 alone investigated in the paper @xcite in the case @xmath144 .",
    "we note here that this equivalence can be extended to the sharp model defined by [ psharp ] because in absence of extrinsic noise eq [ psharp ] is the limit case of a generalization of our model b ( fast gene switching and small number of proteins ) with constant @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in the hypothesis that gene switching is fast and that the activation is caused by h - meric forms ( and not dimeric ) , proceeding as in our main text one gets ( in absence of noise on @xmath13 ) : @xmath145}{b_0+c_0 + c_2 y^h},\\ ] ] which may be rewritten as follows : @xmath146 where @xmath147 @xmath148 thus , if @xmath149 is sufficiently large [ psharpmollified ] reads : @xmath150 summarizing , we may say that for both the sharp and the smooth models of @xcite the intrinsic noise acts in a biologically unrealistic way , equal ( for @xmath151 ) or remindful ( for @xmath152 ) of that investigated in @xcite in the case @xmath144 .",
    "as far as the extrinsic noise is concerned , assaf and coworkers considered an unbounded orenstein - uhlenbeck noise defined as follows @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a unitary white noise . in this way",

    "the employed `` stochastic bifurcation parameter '' is the ratio between the standard deviation of the orenstein - uhlenbeck noise and a parameter named @xmath159 .",
    "this parameter is defined as the average of the ( transitory ) `` quasi - stationary distribution about the high state '' @xcite . since in their simulations",
    "the high state is large ( it ranges from @xmath160 to @xmath161 ) , even @xmath159 has to be large .",
    "indeed , we simulated the sharp feedback model by means of the ( exact ) gillespie algorithm and we got that the average value of the probability density function is very close to the high equilibrium state .",
    "this means that the standard deviation @xmath156 in most of the simulations reported in @xcite largely exceeds @xmath162 .",

    "+      this is obtained by applying a bounded function to a wiener process @xmath171 yielding @xmath172 the noise steady - state distribution is horned and equal to the one of the cai - lin case for @xmath173 . + in figure [ fig : noise ] some typical steady - state distributions from cai - lin and sine - wiener approaches are depicted .",
    "+      autocorrelation , also known as serial correlation , is the cross - correlation of a signal ( a temporal series ) with itself .",
    "informally , it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time - lag between them .",
    "let suppose the noise has at time @xmath174 a value @xmath175 .",
    "autocorrelation characteristic time @xmath25 measures the time window in which the noise has a tendency to `` remember '' its past history , so up to @xmath176 the value of @xmath19 is somewhat similar to @xmath175 . when the noise is totally uncorrelated , like is the case of gaussian white noise , the value @xmath177 is totally independent from @xmath175 for any @xmath178 ( in other words one can say that @xmath179 ) .",

    "a similar result can be obtained with reference to the upper branch of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "indeed , defining @xmath220 and @xmath221 it follows that in the case @xmath222      with respect to the unconditioned probability density @xmath224 the above results show that its asymptotic behavior ( in the functional space of the probability densities , which is a subset of @xmath225 ) strongly depends on its initial conditions .",

    "moreover for values @xmath230 , where @xmath231 , we expect that @xmath232 gets bimodal and @xmath233 decreases . in other words , at @xmath234 there should be a fist - order transition , whereas at @xmath235 a noise - induced transition from unimodality to bimodality ( and a smooth decrease of @xmath236 ) .",
    "two similar transitions should , thus , also be expected in the case @xmath237 .",

    "we believe that this potential might be extremely useful also for stochastically perturbed systems as model d. namely , to our model : @xmath238 it is associated the following time - varying potential : @xmath239 the shape of the potential @xmath240 , and the number and basin of attraction of its potential holes , stochastically change in the time .",
    "thus , for example , in case of small to moderate fluctuations of @xmath32 the corresponding irreversible transition low to large ( large to low ) values of @xmath68 can heuristically be read as the irreversible capture by large ( low ) value attractors of a trajectory initially confined in a potential hole centered at low values of @xmath68 ."
