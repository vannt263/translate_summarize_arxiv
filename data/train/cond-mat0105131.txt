    "we note that this value can vary greatly by changing the substrate potential .",
    "if the intersection energy @xmath19 is not very large , this melting line merges into the phase boundary between the stripe and honeycomb phases .",
    "because the transition from the stripe phase to the honeycomb one is of first order , the system shows a phase separation , in which two phases coexist , for a certain density region ( the shaded ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_final ] ) . from comparison of the zero - point energies of two phases ,",
    "this phase boundary slightly moves to higher density region with lightening the mass .",
    "moreover , in the small - mass limit , commensurate domains themselves would melt and become a conventional isotropic liquid . this isotropic liquid phase is also taken into account in fig.[fig : pd_final ] .",
    "another quantum correction might appear in the width @xmath25 of domain walls .",
    "halpin - healy and karder@xcite argued that , in light atoms , the commensurate solid is more compressible due to quantum fluctuations and the width @xmath25 becomes small , whereas , in heavy atoms , the width @xmath25 is large .",
    "this is consistent with the estimates from experiments , where the width was estimated as @xmath179 for d@xmath1 systems@xcite and @xmath180 for kr systems.@xcite in real adsorbed systems , it is hence likely that due to @xmath26-dependence in @xmath25 the honeycomb phase is favored for heavy atoms and the stripe phase for light atoms [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_final](b ) ] .",
    "in this section we consider the case that stripes are repelling with each other by long - range interactions with a power - decay form .",
    "for example , in doped antiferromagnets , if holes are perfectly doped only in domain walls and domains are insulating , there must be coulomb long - range repulsion between hole - rich domain walls .",
    "let us consider the power - decay interaction @xmath181 between walls , where @xmath12 is a positive constant .",
    "( coulomb repulsion between lines corresponds to @xmath182 , i.e. @xmath183 . ) in the case of coulomb repulsion , however , the plasma modes @xmath184 appear and low - lying excitations in @xmath185-direction does not have @xmath186-linear spectrum .",
    "the plasma modes appear for the long - range interactions @xmath23 with @xmath187 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "hence for stripes with @xmath188 , the stiffness @xmath29 diverges and the elastic theory with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) can not be applied .",
    "hereafter , we consider only the case @xmath189 and use the melting criterion derived in sec.[sec : stripe]b .",
    "the renormalization - group equation@xcite shows that power - law repulsions are not modified by the entoropical force from the hard - core repulsion .",
    "the stiffness @xmath29 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) is hence given by @xmath190 with @xmath191 for any parameter @xmath192 .",
    "after the rescaling @xmath193 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , we have the effective coupling @xmath194 for the effective action ( [ rescaled - action ] ) .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : stiffness_h ] ) into eq.([eq : criterion ] ) , we find that the critical point @xmath119 satisfies @xmath195 where @xmath79 is a positive constant of order unity . from the melting criterion",
    ", we thus find that stripes with @xmath196 melt for small - wall - spacing ( high - density ) region and stabilize for large - wall - spacing ( low - density ) region because of long - range repulsion .",
    "note that this behavior is contrary to the short - range case . a phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_stripelr ] .",
    "this tendency to solidification in low - density region is similar to that of charged point objects , e.g. wigner crystals , and may be universal in systems with coulomb repulsion .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath197 the tendency to striped ordering is the same as the short - range interaction system and stripes become a liquid for low - density region .",

    "to summarize , we studied the effect of quantum fluctuations on 2d domain walls and showed a quantum - melting behavior .",
    "we found that striped domain walls with short - range interactions become a stripe liquid even at zero temperature in the incommensurate phase in the vicinity of the onset of c - ic transition .",
    "we discussed both short - range and long - range interactions that decay in power laws .",
    "it was revealed that striped correlation is enhanced in high density for the case of short - range interactions and in low density for the case of long - range interactions . though we employed various approximations in estimating the stiffness @xmath29 , we believe that the above qualitative conclusion does not drastically depend on the choice of approximations .",
    "we discussed mass dependence of domain - wall structures in adsorbed atoms and obtained phase diagrams as shown in fig.[fig : pd_final ] .",
    "for this purpose , we assumed that the intersection energy is positive .",
    "recently morishita and takagi@xcite performed path - integral monte carlo simulations for @xmath0he on graphite .",
    "their result is consistent with the positive intersection energy .",
    "they also proposed a honeycomb - cage structure where commensurate regions and discommensurate ones are opposite to the honeycomb incommensurate structure.@xcite direct stm measurements of @xmath175he atoms in the incommensurate phase are desired to clarify the real structure.@xcite as we commented in sec .  [ sec : pd ] , the quantum correction to the domain - wall width @xmath25 may be also important to reproduce precise phase diagrams of incommensurate adsorbed atoms on graphite .",
    "evaluation of @xmath26 dependence of @xmath10 remains to be considered .    in a doped mott insulator ,",
    "et al._@xcite discussed appearance of electronic nematic and smectic phases from an analogy of classical liquid crystals . from the symmetry , the stripe liquid we discussed is characterized as a nematic state .",
    "our arguments thus demonstrated appearance of a quantum nematic state at @xmath154 for low - density region and the correlation length to be finite until zero temperature even in pure systems .",
    "a quantum transition from the electronic nematic phase to isotropic fermi liquid was also discussed by oganesyan _",
    "et al_.@xcite    finally , we comment implication of our results on the doping dependence of the incommensurate order observed in la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6.@xcite since incommensurability is proportional to sr concentration @xmath3 in the region @xmath7 , our domain - wall model can be applied in this region .",
    "the system is in the insulating spin - glass phase for @xmath199 and the superconducting phase for @xmath200 .",
    "the correlation length gradually decreases with increasing sr - concentration @xmath3 from @xmath201 and after the system enters into the superconducting phase the correlation length turns to increase .",
    "if we assume that antiferromagnetic domains are insulating in the spin - glass phase and metallic in the superconducting one ( above @xmath202 ) , the wall - wall interaction would show the power - decay and exponential ones , respectively . under this assumption",
    ", the hole - density dependence of the correlation length can be naturally understood from the present results .",
    "more precisely , in coulomb repulsive systems the stiffness @xmath29 is infinite in pure systems due to plasma modes and randomness would be relevant to make the correlation length finite@xcite . another possibility would be that , antiferromagnetic domains are always insulating for @xmath7 and there is power - decay force between stripes . in that case , to understand enhancement of the correlation length in @xmath203 , we may need to consider that the wall - wall interaction is enhanced in the superconducting phase due to coupling with fluctuations of superconductivity .",
