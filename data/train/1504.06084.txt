    "the associated nambu - goldstone boson , the axion , obtains a non - vanishing potential due to the axial anomaly . eventually , the effective @xmath3-angle is cancelled by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the axion at the minimum of the axion potential .",
    "the original realization of the axion@xcite , however , has been excluded experimentally . there , the axion field is embedded in higgs doublets and the decay constant of the axion , @xmath11 , is tied to the electroweak breaking scale , @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 . then the mass of the axion field is roughly given by , @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the decay constant and the mass of the neutral pion , @xmath17mev and @xmath18mev .",
    "such a light axion with @xmath19 has been extensively searched for via the decay of mesons and quarkonia , which ends up with a lower limit on the decay constant , @xmath20tev(see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "laboratory constraints can be evaded if the pq - symmetry breaking scale is separated from @xmath12 and at a scale much higher than @xmath12 .",
    "for such a large decay constant , however , the axion mass becomes very small and has trouble with astrophysics .",
    "eventually , the lower limit of the decay constant is pushed up to @xmath21gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on these observations , two classes of models of the invisible axion have been proposed , often called ksvz@xcite and dsfz@xcite axion models , and their phenomenological and astrophysical / cosmological properties have been extensively studied ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue another possibility to evade all the constraints , a heavy axion . for that purpose",
    ", we need another source of the axion mass than the qcd dynamics , i.e. additional breaking of the pq - symmetry to the axial anomaly of qcd . such additional",
    "breaking , however , can not be arbitrary since newly added pq - breaking terms spoil the successful cancellation of the effective @xmath3-angle at the minimunm of the axion potential . to resolve the dilemma",

    "thanks to the alignment , the @xmath3-angles in the two sectors are cancelled simultaneously at the minimum of the axion potential . in this study , we carefully examine whether the idea can be realized consistently with all the constraints , in particular with cosmological ones , by constructing a concrete model .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section[sec :",
    "dynamics ] , we introduce a concrete model of the axion with the mirrored standard model sector . there , we also summarize laboratory and astrophysical constraints on axion parameters . in section[sec : cosmology1 ] , we discuss cosmological constraints on the axion . in section[sec : cosmology2 ] , we discuss cosmological constraints on particles in the mirrored sector . in section[sec : z2 ] , we discuss how to differentiate mass scales in the mirrored sector from those in the standard model sector without spoiling the pq solution to the strong @xmath2-problem .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us first introduce two copies of the standard model each of which has a single higgs doublet .",
    "we name them the standard model sector and the mirrored sector , respectively . in the following , we put primes on parameters and fields in the mirrored sector to distinguish them from those in the standard model sector .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that dimensionless parameters in both sectors are equal with each other due to a @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "in particular , the effective @xmath3-angles in the two sectors are aligned , @xmath23 at the high energy input scale such as the planck scale .",
    "the electroweak scale and the qcd scale in the mirrored sector , on the other hand , can be different from those in the standard model due to a soft breaking of the @xmath22 symmetry ( see section[sec : z2 ] ) .    to realize the pq - symmetry , we introduce a gauge singlet complex scalar field @xmath24 which couples to vector - like pairs of ( anti-)fundamental fermions ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 and @xmath30 via @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes a coupling constant . here",

    "after chiral symmetry breaking by qcd and qcd@xmath44 dynamics , the axion obtains a mass through the mixings to the pions in the two sectors . in particular ,",

    "thus , even if we set @xmath184 nominally , the actual electroweak scale becomes much larger than @xmath12 automatically .",
    "gev . in the gray shaded regions ,",
    "the relative sizes between the dynamical scale and the quark masses are different from those in the standard model sector .",
    "the red shaded ( right - upper corner ) region is excluded since the mirrored pion mass is larger than @xmath175gev . in the blue shaded ( upper horizontal ) region ,",
    "the masses of the mirror quarks exceed @xmath9tev . here",
    ", we assume that the seesaw mechanism in the mirrored sector is turned off , so that the charged pion ( or the corresponding quarkonum ) is stable .",
    "the ( red ) dashed line corresponds to the @xmath185 which is increased purely by the effect of the larger @xmath172 . ]    now , let us discuss how to differentiate the scales of the two sectors by the soft breaking of @xmath22 symmetry . for that purpose ,",
    "let us introduce a spurion field , @xmath186 , which changes its sign under the @xmath22 symmetry . here",
    "@xmath187 has a mass dimension one . with the help of the spurion , it is possible to achieve @xmath188 and allow them to take almost any values .",
    "concretely , we may choose @xmath22 invariant parameters , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , @xmath192 so that @xmath193 .",
    "it should be cautioned here that @xmath187 can not be arbitrarily large , since it might appear any complex phases of parameters in the two sectors suppressed by the reduced planck scale , i.e.  @xmath194 with opposite signs .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3-angles in the two sectors may depend on @xmath187 by @xmath195 with an @xmath9 common coefficient .",
    "therefore , there is an upper limit on the size of the spurion , @xmath196 so that too large @xmath197 does not appear in the standard model sector at the minimum of the axion potential .",
    "next , let us discuss how to achieve a larger dynamical scale in the mirrored sector .",
    "as utilized in @xcite to achieve a larger axion mass , the dynamical scale of the mirrored sector automatically increases by taking @xmath182 since quarks decouple at higher energy scales than the standard model sector . in fig.[fig : mass ] , we show @xmath185 which is increased purely by the larger @xmath172 as a ( red ) dashed line",
    ". the figure shows , however , that the axion can not be heavy enough unless @xmath198gev where the quark mass in the mirrored sector exceeds @xmath9tev .",
    "thus , in order to achieve a viable axion mass , @xmath199mev , we need to increase @xmath185 itself .    with the help of @xmath187 ,",
    "the larger @xmath185 can be easily achieved by introducing extra scalar quarks whose masses again depend on @xmath187 , i.e. @xmath200 where @xmath201 denotes the number of the extra scalar quarks .- angles , although it may be possible to consider extra fermionic colored particles without affecting the effective @xmath3 angles . ] as a simple example , let us choose @xmath201 so that the beta functions of the @xmath202 gauge coupling constant vanish when the mass of the scalar quark is negligible . in this case , the ratio @xmath203 is roughly given by @xmath204",
    ". should be at most of the order of @xmath205gev , since the size of @xmath187 is constrained to be @xmath206 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath207 can not be achieved by fine - tuning .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath208 , for example , the mass of extra scalar quarks in the standard model sector is of @xmath209gev or smaller , and hence , they are in the thermal bath after inflation if the reheating temperature higher than @xmath210gev as required by thermal leptogenesis . in such case , we need separate discussions on how to make these particles unstable . ]    by the similar token , we can differentiate the nature of spontaneous breaking of the @xmath154 symmetry in the two sectors .",
    "that is , by again assuming that the mass terms of the @xmath154 breaking fields @xmath211 in the two sectors depend on @xmath187 , we can easily turn on / off spontaneous symmetry breaking in the two sectors . as the size of @xmath187",
    "is limited from above , so is the @xmath154 breaking scale , @xmath212gev in the standard model .",
    "fortunately , such @xmath154 breaking scale is high enough to allow thermal leptogenesis in the standard model sector .    before closing this section .",
    "let us discuss how largely the @xmath3-angles in the two sectors deviate with each other by the soft breaking of the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "as we have discussed , the tree - level contributions to the differences of the effective @xmath3-angle are controlled by the size of @xmath187 , i.e. @xmath213 .",
    "once we take the weak interactions into account , however , there are another sources of the @xmath2-violation , the ckm , the mns , and majorana phases of the two sectors . since the electroweak scale and the structure of the neutrino masses are differentiated between the two sectors , the radiative corrections to the effective @xmath3-angles are different in the two sectors . fortunately ,",
    "those differences appear at most through @xmath214 effects further suppressed by flavor mixings and quark masses@xcite , and hence , their effects on the @xmath3-angles are highly suppressed .",
    "radiative corrections including the mass mixing parameters in eq.([eq : mixing ] ) also contributes to the effective @xmath3-angles .",
    "such contributions are again suppressed by @xmath215 and quark mixings , and hence , the resultant deviation of the angles are very small .",
    "therefore , the uses of the softly broken @xmath22 symmetry do not spoil the success of the pq solution to the strong @xmath2-problem .",
    "in this paper , we have pursued a ksvz - type axion model where the axion mass is enhanced by a strong dynamics in the mirrored standard model sector .",
    "as we have discussed , the model is consistent with all the constraints when the mass of the axion is of @xmath0mev or above even for a relatively low pq - breaking scale , @xmath1gev .",
    "we have also noticed that turning off the seesaw mechanism in the mirrored sector solves the two problems simultaneously , the mirrored neutrino abundance and the too large relic mirrored nucleon mass density .",
    "we have also shown that the mass scales of two sectors can be differentiated systematically by using a softly broken @xmath22 symmetry without spoiling the pq solution to the strong @xmath2-problem .",
    "one unsatisfactory aspect of this model is that the axion is no more the candidate for dark matter . as an interesting alternative",
    ", the neutron in the mirrored sector might be a dark matter candidate for @xmath216tev . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath216tev is achieved by a large @xmath183 , which induces the electroweak scale in the mirrored sector at around the similar scale .",
    "interestingly , in this parameter region , the mass difference between the proton and the neutron in the mirrored sector is dominated by qed quantum corrections , and hence , the neutron is automatically lighter than the proton in the mirrored sector .",
    "therefore , it can be a good dark matter candidate since it does not have long - range self - interactions .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the charged pion mass in the mirrored sector is expected to be @xmath0gev in this parameter range , and hence , this possibility might have a tension with the constraint on the mass density fraction of matter with long - range interactions@xcite .",
    "this tension can be easily solved , for example , by assuming that there are only two right - handed neutrinos in each sector , so that one of the left - handed neutrinos in each sector become massless@xcite . with this additional assumption ,",
    "the charged pion in the mirrored sector decays into a charged leptons and a massless neutrino , so that it does not contributes to the dark matter density .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the @xmath10 pq - symmetry is an almost exact symmetry of the model broken only by the axial anomaly .",
    "it is generically believed , however , that global symmetries are not respected at least by quantum gravity , and hence , the pq - symmetry may be explicitly broken by planck suppressed operators , @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "such higher dimensional operators leave a non - vanishing effective @xmath3-angle at the minimum of the axion potential , @xmath219 for dimension five operators ( @xmath220 ) , we obtain @xmath221 which is consistent with the current upper limit on the effective @xmath3-angle if @xmath222 for @xmath223gev .",
    "the stability against possible quantum gravity effects is the merit of axion models with a small decay constant and a large axion mass .",
    "it is interesting that a non - vanishing effective @xmath3-angle may be observed in near future .",
    "we note that the small decay constant and the large axion mass is also advantageous when one tries to understand the pq symmetry as an accidental one resulting from other exact gauge symmetries  ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in invisible axion models , where @xmath224gev , one must forbid pq - breaking operators up to dimension - ten in order not to induce too large deviation of the effective @xmath3-angle .",
    "it is not trivial to obtain such a high quality of the accidental pq symmetry . in our model , as we have discussed above , it is enough to forbid pq symmetry breaking by renormalizable interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we did not copy the pq symmetry and the pq breaking field @xmath24 .",
    "it is also possible that there exist a mirrored pq symmetry and a mirrored pq breaking , with couplings @xmath225 assuming that the two pq symmetries are softly broken down to a single pq symmetry by the interaction @xmath226 we obtain an axion model with vanishing effective @xmath3-angles .",
    "must be real .",
    "this is guaranteed by the @xmath22 symmetry . ] if the breaking scale @xmath227 is sufficiently small , there are two light axions .",
    "let us comment on how visible the present axion model is .",
    "due to a small pq - breaking scale , the axion may be searched for at high intensity low energy collider experiments ( see @xcite for related axion search ) . in particular , the new beam dump experiment at cern , the ship experiment , is expected to cover axion parameter regions with a shorter lifetime ( and hence a heavier axion ) than the charm experiments  @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is the direct production of the axion and the radial component @xmath228 at the lhc experiments .",
    "in fact , since they couple to the gluon rather strongly , they have sizable production cross sections.tev , the production cross sections of the axion and its scalar partner @xmath228 via the gluon fusion process are @xmath0fb and @xmath229@xmath230fb for @xmath231gev and @xmath232tev , respectively at the @xmath80@xmath233tev lhc . ]",
    "once they are produced at the lhc , the axion immediately decays into jets , while @xmath228 decays into a pair of axions which subsequently decay into jets .",
    "when the axion mass is of @xmath9gev or below , @xmath228 appears as a two - jet resonance in the @xmath9tev region , which is difficult to be distinguished from qcd background processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when the axion mass if of @xmath234@xmath235gev , on the other hand , @xmath228 decays into two axions which can be distinguished from qcd background processes by looking for peaks in the dijet invariant mass distributions made by the decay of the axion@xcite . as we mentioned in section[sec : dynamics ] , the production of the extra quarks at the lhc experiments is also an interesting possibility of the present axion model .",
    "it is also possible to search for particles in the mirrored sector . here , we just list possible detection methods .",
    "at least , mirrored particles couple to standard model particles through the pq breaking field @xmath24 .",
    "the pq breaking field @xmath24 is produced at the lhc experiments and decays not only into standard model particles but also into mirrored particles , which are invisible for detectors in the lhc experiments .",
    "a channel with jet(s ) plus missing energy may be useful in searching for the invisible decay .",
    "the possible kinetic mixing between @xmath236 and @xmath159 gauge bosons is also interesting.mirrored particles may be produced in the collision of standard model particles through the exchange of the gauge bosons .",
    "thermal relics of stable charged particles in the mirrored sector ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : cosmology2 ] ) may be detectable through charged massive particle searches .    before closing this paper , let us also comment that the above discussion can be easily extended to the model consisting of two copies of the standard model each of which has two higgs doublets , so that the pq - symmetry is realized as in the original peccei - quinn - weinberg - wilczek ( pqww ) axion model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there , the two sectors share a unique pq - symmetry through quartic couplings between the two higgs doublets in the two sectors .",
    "contrary to the mirrored ksvz - type model , the axion decay constant @xmath11 is tied to the electroweak scale in the mirrored sector , i.e. @xmath237 . the quark mass ratios @xmath238 in the two sectors can also differ with each other due to the difference of the ratios of the vacuum expectation values of the doublets in each sector , i.e. @xmath239 . by repeating our discussion , we will find that the axion should be again heavier than @xmath0mev , so that the model is safely consistent with laboratory , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints .",
    "thus , we will again need to invoke a mechanism which achieves @xmath240 separately from the size of @xmath241 ( see section [ sec : z2 ] ) .",
    "one interesting feature of the mirrored pqww model is that the @xmath242 can be also broken spontaneously depending on the mass parameters and quartic couplings of the higgs doublets in the two sectors . in such case ,",
    "even the  charged \" particles in the mirrored sector can be good dark matter candidates .",
    "we will explore those possibilities elsewhere .",
    "another interesting phenomenological difference of the pqww model is that the main decay mode of the axion is not the one into three pions but into a pair of muons even for @xmath74.mev , the mode into @xmath243 opens , and hence , the hadronic modes become dominant eventually .",
    "] thus , this type of the axion can be more visible at the future beam dump experiments such as the ship experiment .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to detect this type of axion by searching for displaced vertices inside the detectors of the lhc experiments made by the axion decay@xcite .",
