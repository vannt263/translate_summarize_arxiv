    "the understanding of small-@xmath3 scaling violations in qcd has become increasingly important with the discovery of the steep rise of structure functions at hera@xcite . such rise may be related to the hard pomeron@xcite small-@xmath3 behaviour@xcite , but may be also understood through large scaling violations@xcite and may also fit in a fixed order perturbative approach@xcite .",
    "the above ambiguities are partly unavoidable , because of the lack of sufficiently precise @xcite , independent measurements of small-@xmath3 parton densities@xcite , but are partly due to the lack of complete understanding of scaling violations , at theoretical level . in fact , in the small-@xmath3 region , the qcd perturbative series is affected by large logarithms - similarly to what happens in semihard processes @xcite - and becomes dependent on the effective coupling constant @xmath4 or @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the moment index .",
    "therefore , a hierarchy of perturbative terms is defined in the usual way @xmath8 for both the singlet anomalous dimension matrix and the coefficient functions .",
    "furthermore , since gluons couple to electro - weak probes only through quarks , we actually need leading ( l ) coefficient functions and up to next - to - leading ( nl ) anomalous dimensions , in order to have a factorization scheme independent result for dis .",
    "this theoretical program has been partly achieved at quark level [ 8 - 10 ] , but is not yet complete at gluon level , despite various efforts [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "nevertheless , such completion is needed in order to well understand scaling violations , and then be able to look at the small-@xmath3 behaviour of initial data@xcite so as to find the hard pomeron rise , if any .    in this paper",
    "we wish to present a resummation method which is valid for all the relevant quantities up to nl level , and to apply it to coefficients and anomalous dimensions in the so called @xmath1-scheme @xcite , including the new @xmath2 contributions to the gluon anomalous dimension , already reported in a short note @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the idea of @xmath9-factorization @xcite , which is just a way of exploiting the consistency of high - energy factorized quantities , which are @xmath9-dependent , with renormalization group ( r.g . )",
    "factorization , which is not .",
    "the all - order resummation is obtained by @xmath9-integrations of low order @xmath9-dependent kernels .",
    "therefore , we shall proceed in two steps .",
    "our first goal is to explicitate the nl consistency requirements between high - energy and collinear factorization with running coupling referring , for definiteness , to hard processes of dis type , characterized by a probe with a large scale @xmath10 and by a target with scale @xmath11 .",
    "this will allow us to obtain well defined resummation formulas in terms of kernels of bfkl type @xcite , up to nl level .    as a second step",
    ", we shall proceed to the study of the nl kernel itself , of its eigenvalues , and of the resummed formulas for the @xmath2 contributions .",
    "this study is based on the phase - space integration of the squared @xmath12 production matrix elements @xcite , combined with the virtual corrections available in the literature @xcite .    to start illustrating the first step ,",
    "let us notice that @xmath9-factorization is due to the exchange of an off - shell gluon of virtuality @xmath13 , which behaves , at high energies , as a regge pole yielding a quasi - constant cross - section . on the other hand ,",
    "collinear factorization is due to nearly on - shell quarks and gluons , providing logarithmic scaling violations .",
    "therefore , the two kinds of factorization are not related a priori . in unbroken gauge theories like qcd",
    ", a relationship can be established because the ( regge ) gluon polarization coincides , on shell , with one of the collinear polarizations @xcite .",
    "for instance , at one loop level , regge behaviour is established , in the gluon channel , by the singular behaviour of the dglap splitting functions @xcite @xmath14 or in moment index space @xmath15 , by a correspondingly singular anomalous dimension matrix @xmath16 @xmath17    however , establishing such relationship at next to leading level requires the treatment of several subtle points .",
    "firstly , @xmath9-factorization is useful in the gluon channel only , while collinear factorization involves both gluons and quark - sea . how to recover from the former the two - channel picture of the latter ?",
    "furthermore , even in the gluon channel , the high energy exchange does not yield all collinear singular gluon contributions , some of which occur at low energies , as is apparent from eq .",
    "how to relate the two gluon definitions and to get all subleading terms ?    finally , the renormalization group evolution with running coupling has been always assumed in order to extract physical predictions from @xmath9-factorization .",
    "is this behaviour really consistent with the bfkl equation and its `` hard pomeron '' singularity at nl level ?    in sec .",
    "2 we shall show , on the basis of the work of fadin , lipatov and collaborators [ 11 - 14 ] and of our group [ 8 - 10,16 ] , that a detailed comparison of high - energy and renormalization group is nevertheless possible and provides resummation formulas for the nl anomalous dimension matrix ( and for the leading coefficient functions ) in the @xmath1 factorization scheme .",
    "the basic point is that , as it appears from refs .",
    "[ 8 - 16 ] and ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath18-channel iteration is not yet relevant at nl @xmath19 level , while @xmath20-channel iteration is provided by a generalized high energy integral equation , in which low energy @xmath9-dependent kernels occur .",
    "this result , with some modifications , forms the basis for the representation of the two - scale problems with anomalous dimensions that we provide here .",
    "some of the questions asked above do have a tricky answer , however .",
    "firstly , even at leading twist level , we find that the renormalization group representation with running coupling is valid , for @xmath21 , only in the regime of @xmath22 , with @xmath23 where the critical constant @xmath24 is related to the bfkl kernel .",
    "this means that we have to stay away from a @xmath20-dependent singularity in the @xmath25 plane , or in other words , that the effective variable @xmath0 should not be too large .",
    "furthermore , the bare hard pomeron singularity , which occurs in the coefficient function , and ultimately dominates the small-@xmath3 behaviour , turns out to be dependent on the large distance behaviour of the running coupling , due to a diffusion process towards low values of @xmath26 .",
    "fortunately , this fact does not affects the r. g. factorization , valid in the regime ( 1.4 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , within the anomalous dimension representation , the two - channel picture obtains because of the presence of two distinct anomalous dimension eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 being the leading one . while the nl hierarchy is straightforward for the @xmath27 contributions , it requires careful handling of a whole chain of collinear singular kernels for the @xmath28 contribution , as we shall see .",
    "in other words , comparing the high - energy and r. g. approaches is not straightforward at nl level , mostly because they resum the perturbative series in different orders .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows . in the next section we set up the nl factorization framework with scales @xmath10 and @xmath1 and",
    "we discuss the structure of its solution in the anomalous dimension regime defined before , by singling out running coupling effects , and by discussing the role of the hard pomeron singularity and its model dependence @xcite .    in the following sections we concentrate on the calculation of the anomalous dimensions themselves . in sec .",
    "3 we provide the @xmath2 emission kernel for massive quarks and in sec .",
    "4 we combine it with virtual corrections in the massless limit to get the ( regularized ) complete eigenvalue and the ensuing resummation formulas .",
    "we discuss our results in sec . 5 and we provide the details of the phase - space integration and of the kernel diagonalization in appendices a - c .",
    "let us formally define the unintegrated gluon density @xmath29 by the high - energy limit of the six - point function in fig . 1 .",
    "such density is a function of the moment index @xmath15 and of the momentum transfer @xmath26 of the exchanged gluon , and will eventually be measured by coupling it to physical probes , as done later on for the dis structure functions at scale q.    we shall assume that the gluon density satisfies , at nl level , the bfkl - type equation of fig .",
    "1 , whose kernel will be written in the form @xmath30 where we have factored out the running coupling at the `` upper '' scale @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath31    furthermore @xmath32 represents the leading kernel @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the nl one , which can be assumed to be scale invariant and contains no high - energy gluon exchange contributions .",
    "its specific form has been discussed at length in the literature [ 11 - 14,16,19 ] , and its @xmath35-dependent part will be explicitated in sec .",
    "because of scale invariance , we can define the kernel eigenvalue @xmath36 by the equation @xmath37 the explicit form of @xmath38 is known at leading level , yielding @xmath39 and the nl @xmath2 contribution @xmath40 will be given in sec . 4 , where we also prove the factorization of the logarithm in eq . ( 2.2 ) .",
    "let us stress the point that factorizing the running coupling at scale @xmath26 is not necessarily an indication of the `` natural '' scale of the problem , which rather seems to be @xmath41 , the emitted gluon transverse momentum ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "in fact , at nl level , a change of scale in the factorized logarithm of eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) can be compensated by a corresponding change of the scale - invariant kernel @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of @xmath26 allows us to deal with a type of equation already studied in the literature .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out long ago @xcite that by writing the master equation @xmath42 in the @xmath43-moments representation @xmath44 we get a differential equation in @xmath43 , with the formal solution @xmath45.\\ ] ] here we have denoted by @xmath46 the primitive of the eigenvalue function , i.e. , @xmath47 and we have denoted by @xmath48 the @xmath43-moment of the ( low - energy ) inhomogeneous term in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) .    actually , the formal solution ( 2.8 ) has to be modified in order to deal with the running coupling ( 2.2 ) in the small @xmath26 region around the landau pole . cutting off [ 22 - 24 ] or smoothing out such a pole results in modifying the large @xmath49 region in the representation ( 2.8 ) by adding to the inhomogeneous term some @xmath25-dependent contribution which contains the pomeron singularity @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the green s function of eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) in the regime @xmath50 , where @xmath1 represents the scale of the inhomogeneous term and we have shown that it factorizes in the form    @xmath51 \\exp\\left({\\frac{1}{\\bar{b}\\o } } x(\\g^\\prime)\\right)+\\\\ & + \\text{pomeron terms.}{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have also found that the position and the structure of the pomeron singularity in eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) is dependent on the smoothing out procedure of @xmath52 , and decouples only in the limit of a hard initial scale ( @xmath53 ) , being suppressed , in that case , by ( roughly ) powers of @xmath54 .",
    "the results above show that , in the limit of @xmath55 , we have exact consistency with the na@xmath56ve perturbative result in eq . ( 2.8 ) , because we can set @xmath57 in the second integral of this equation .",
    "if instead @xmath58 is of order unity , the structure of the large @xmath20 solution remains factorized , but the coefficient in front is not really calculable , being dependent on the low @xmath20 behaviour of @xmath59 , i. e. on soft hadronic interactions .    in either case",
    "the nl bfkl equation remains consistent with the r. g .. in fact , in the anomalous dimension regime , defined by @xmath60 the large @xmath20 behaviour of eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) is dominated by the perturbative branch @xmath61 of the saddle point equation @xmath62    by integrating in @xmath43 over the spread @xmath63 on the imaginary axis , we find the expression @xmath64},\\ ] ] where the exponent @xmath65 is the one predicted by the r. g .. it is clear that if the limitation ( 2.14 ) is not satisfied , the representation ( 2.15 ) breaks down , due to large @xmath43-fluctuations .",

    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , in the case several saddle points are present , a sum over them is understood . at nl level , we need at least two of them corresponding to the two eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( sec . 2.2 ) .    secondly , in the limit @xmath70 , the na@xmath56ve expression ( 2.8 ) applies , and we can set @xmath71 so that a perturbative evaluation is possible , as in the following examples .",
    "_ initial gluon with fixed virtuality .",
    "_ in this case , we use @xmath9-factorization at the lower scale also , so that we can fix the gluon virtuality in a gauge invariant way , by setting @xmath72 .",
    "the inhomogeneous term becomes a @xmath73-function in the @xmath9-space , or @xmath74 in the @xmath43-space .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath58 ( @xmath75 ) we can use a saddle point located at @xmath76 at the lower scale also with @xmath43-spread @xmath77 , so as to get the approximate expression @xmath78\\ ] ] which is @xmath20-independent as expected .    _ initial probe at scale @xmath1_. this scale can be due , for instance , to heavy quark production ( @xmath79 ) , or to a virtual electroweak probe . in either case",
    "one should use @xmath9-factorization to define @xmath80 as an off - shell cross section along the lines of refs .",
    "[ 8 - 10 ] . in all these cases ,",
    "the @xmath81 function has , by scale invariance , a @xmath58-dependence of the type ( 2.21 ) apart from a @xmath43-dependent factor , computed in some cases @xcite , which is analytic in the strip @xmath82 .",
    "the argument about @xmath20-scale dependence of @xmath83 goes through as before .",
    "note , that the perturbative evaluation ( 2.22 ) is valid only if the pomeron term in @xmath84 can be neglected .",
    "this implies that @xmath85 should not be too large at the lower scale also .",
    "the latter assumption is not required in the more general expression ( 2.18 ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the quark - sea contribution by the flavour - singlet part of the @xmath86 structure function itself ( dis scheme for the quark ) .",
    "this one can be divided in a direct low - energy contribution @xmath87 , which contains collinear singularities but not @xmath88 singularities , and in a gluon exchange part ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the latter",
    "is evaluated by using @xmath9-factorization , in terms of the unintegrated gluon density defined before , as follows @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the gauge - invariant off - shell cross - section introduced in ref .",

    "while at leading level we only have the contribution of the bfkl anomalous dimension @xmath100 @xmath101 at nl level we expect saddle points located at the two eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 where we have used the fact that , at leading level @xmath104 , and that the nl @xmath105 starts at one loop level ( @xmath106 ) .    here",
    "a subtle point arises .",
    "the nl hierarchy of the bfkl kernel really works only around the leading eigenvalue @xmath27 , but not around @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , subleading bfkl kernels of order @xmath107 ( the leading one corresponding to @xmath108 ) show multiple collinear singularities of order @xmath109 . evaluating the latter around @xmath110 yields genuinely subleading terms of relative order @xmath111 . instead , for small values of @xmath112 all subleading kernels become of the same order !",
    "this means that , in order to recover the correct collinear behaviour of the partonic green s functions around @xmath113 , we need to resum a whole series of collinear singular bfkl kernels .",
    "for instance , at one loop level , the analogue of @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) ( @xmath115 ) is simply found from the dglap equations . keeping @xmath59 frozen for simplicity we obtain @xmath116 which satisfies a bfkl - type equation of the form ( 2.6 ) , with @xmath117 where",

( 4.18 ) is large , and - if extended to large @xmath43 values - would provide a negative and sizeable shift of the pomeron intercept and important resummation effects , unlike what happens for the @xmath2 contribution .",
    "although we do not think the estimate ( 4.18 ) is reliable when approaching @xmath203 , it provides an indication of the existence of unsuppressed planar contributions in the gluonic part .",
    "the complete calculation is therefore a rather important goal to achieve .",
    "we have studied in this paper the anomalous dimension representation for the nl bfkl equation and the ensuing resummation formulas , by analysing in detail the @xmath2 contributions to the larger anomalous dimension eigenvalue .    our first result ( sec .",
    "2 ) is that the r.g . representation with running coupling and resummed anomalous dimensions is valid at nl level in the regime @xmath226 that is , if the variable @xmath227 is not too large .",
    "if the condition ( 5.1 ) is coupled with the saddle point estimate of important @xmath228 values we end up with the limitation @xmath229 which provides a parabola - like boundary in the @xmath230 , @xmath231 plane .",
    "conditions of type ( 5.1 ) have been already noticed before @xcite as singularities of the anomalous dimension and those of the type ( 5.2 ) have been known for a while @xcite to be relevant , with different numerical factors , for the occurrence of higher twist unitarization effects [ 27 - 29 ] .",
    "here we just emphasize that , within the regions ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.2 ) there is a well defined resummation of anomalous dimensions , provided here , which is able to describe the qcd evolution in agreement with the nl bfkl equation ( fig 7 ) .",
    "the renormalization group description in the regime ( 5.1 ) holds independently of the detailed properties of the hard pomeron , i.e. of the leading singularity in the @xmath228-plane which dominates the small-@xmath3 , fixed @xmath143 behaviour .",
    "the latter occurs in the coefficient function , and is dependent on the soft region behaviour of the running coupling , in particular on its magnitude and shape around @xmath232 .",
    "only if the scale @xmath233 is large enough , the pomeron decouples , and the coefficient function takes a perturbative form , provided the rapidity is not so large to allow diffusion from @xmath233 to @xmath234 .",

    "we find that higher order effects for the @xmath35 dependent part are small in @xmath27 , while they are not small in the coefficients @xmath202 and @xmath237 .",
    "this difference is due to the non - planar nature of the diagrams which yield the most important large @xmath9 contributions .",
    "they are suppressed by a colour factor when coupling to gluons , while they are not when coupling to photons .",
    "we have also found that running coupling effects , although expected , are particularly important .",
    "first of all , they affect the coefficient functions by factors of type @xmath93 in eqs .",
    "( 2.19 ) and ( 5.5 ) due to the fluctuations of the anomalous dimension variable @xmath43 , which are large when @xmath43 approaches the saturation value @xmath203 .",
    "ultimately , this is the reason for the breaking of the r. g. representation itself when approaching the critical value ( 5.1 ) , as also noticed in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the running of @xmath242 at large @xmath20 values , emphasizes the diffusion towards small values of @xmath26 , and the need of smoothing out the effective coupling around the landau pole .",
    "this in turn clarifies the fact that the bare hard pomeron singularity is actually dependent on soft physics , even if small-@xmath3 scaling violations are not .",
    "it thus appears that , so far , apart from running coupling effects , large higher order contributions only occur in the @xmath105 entry of the anomalous dimension matrix , which was the basis for an early explanation of the hera data @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the absence of higher order effects in @xmath27 may be a feature of the @xmath35-dependent part only , which is mostly nonplanar .",
    "for the gluonic part , planar diagrams could also contribute , as it happens in the crude collinear estimate of eq .",
