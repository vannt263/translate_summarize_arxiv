    "gases of singly charged ions can be spatially confined by paul or penning traps @xcite .",
    "when they are laser cooled to sufficiently low temperatures , they form wigner crystals @xcite , which are examples of a self - organized systems .",
    "wigner crystals have been observed and characterized in several atomic physics experiments @xcite and have recently attracted considerable attention as a platform for investigating nonlinear dynamics close to criticality .",
    "some examples of the studies of the nonlinear dynamics of ion crystals include the simulation of linear and nonlinear klein - gordon fields on a lattice @xcite , the study of nucleation of topological defects @xcite , as well as proposals to realize models related to dry friction and energy transport @xcite and synchronization @xcite .",
    "the idea behind these works is to use ion traps as a flexible platform for designing experiments aimed at realizing various models of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the high degree of isolation of the ion crystals from the surrounding environment , which is usually achieved in experiments , implies also the possibility to enter the regime where quantum mechanical effects must be accounted for to describe critical phenomena @xcite , and where the quantum motion can be utilized for quantum information using trapped ions @xcite .    ]    in this paper we consider the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of a chain of ions , when the frequency of the transverse potential is quenched across the linear to zigzag transition .",
    "this analysis has been previously performed by some of us in two dimension @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a trap which is invariant by rotation about the chain axis . before we continue , let us provide some relevant information about the system we consider . in @xcite it has been shown that the linear - zigzag transition is a continuous phase transition and it can be described by means of landau model . in a potential like the one here",
    "considered the symmetry breaking is associated with the formation of two chains on a plane , forming a polar angle which is distributed with equal probability in the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "these considerations are strictly valid in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the number of ions is finite , the boundary conditions play an important role .",
    "in particular , for periodic boundary conditions the ground state in the zigzag phase may exhibit a twist .",
    "the assumption of periodic boundary conditions is consistent with experimental realizations , such as in storage rings @xcite or in ion rings which can be observed in multipole traps @xcite . in these system , thus , the dynamics we discuss in this paper could be observed .",
    "the topology of the ion ring trap plays a crucial role in our study .",
    "if the transition is driven instead in a linear paul trap under transverse isotropic confinement , zig - zag domains are formed in an early stage .",
    "subsequently a local relaxation occurs in which the different domains coaligne and merge , resulting in the growth of a single domain that eventually extends over the whole chain . as a result ,",
    "no information concerning the dynamics of the transition remains .",
    "given an initial state of the system , which is a linear chain with some small random perturbation of the ion positions and velocities , it is usually considered impossible to predict the winding number of the final helical configuration without numerically solving the equations of motion , even if the dynamics is fully deterministic .",
    "however , it may be easier to make predictions about the expected average of the winding numbers resulting from many experimental runs .",
    "hence , we shall pay particular attention to the universal features of the dependence of the average winding number of the helix on the quench rate of the phase transition .",
    "in annular josephson tunnel junctions undergoing a thermal quench , the formation of fluxons ( supercurrents carrying a single quantum of magnetic flux associated with a non - zero winding number of the order parameter ) has attracted much attention , and was indeed experimentally addressed in @xcite . in a recent work @xcite the kibble - zurek ( kz ) theory has been similarly applied to quantify the spontaneous circulation in a newborn bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) created in a toroidal trap by quenching the chemical potential of the system at a finite rate .",
    "we shall see that ion chains constitute an experimentally advantageous platform to study the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking , where kz theory can analogously be used to predict the scaling of the winding number in the helical ion chain .",
    "we have used numerical simulations to verify the kz prediction and we find that within the statistical uncertainty the kz prediction holds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the ginzburg- landau description of the linear to zigzag structural phase transition in three - dimensions . in section 3",
    "we show that kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) can be used to relate the average winding number to the quench rate .",
    "the results , which have been numerically evaluated , are presented in section 4 and compared with the predictions of the kzm . in section 5",
    "the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that near the critical point of the linear to zigzag phase transition the classical ground state and the low energy excitations of a chain of ions can be described using ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "its time - dependent version governs the nucleation of kinks in the zig - zag phase @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model , emphasizing the 3d nature of the transition , and discuss some of its properties .",
    "the derivation starts by writing the potential energy of the system .",
    "consider a system of ions confined to a space with periodic boundary in the @xmath1 direction and experiencing harmonic potential in the transverse direction with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath3 ions having mass @xmath4 , charge @xmath5 and coordinates @xmath6 the potential energy reads    @xmath7    the ground state of the system is a linear chain , provided that @xmath2 is above a critical frequency , @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the riemann zeta function and the characteristic frequency is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spacing between the ions @xcite . at frequencies just below @xmath12 ,",
    "the linear chain configuration is unstable , with the zigzag becoming a favourable configuration . in the rest of this section ,",
    "a continuum description of the system will allow us to establish a close correspondence with the ginzburg - landau model .",
    "nonetheless , we shall come back to the full model in the rest of the paper .    in the vicinity of the critical point",
    "the energy of the system can be written as @xcite @xmath13,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "v^{(4 ) } & = & \\frac{g}{4}\\frac{m}{a}\\int dx\\left(y^{4}+2z^{2}y^{2}+z^{4}\\right),\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , and the formulas for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given in @xcite , but their exact values are not needed in the current work .",
    "the continuum approximation is valid if the spatial variation of the transverse displacement of the ions is small in relation to the ion spacing .",
    "we can define @xmath17 and rewrite ( [ eq : glenergy ] ) in a more compact form    @xmath18.\\label{eq : glenergy2}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : dwell ] illustrates graphically the meaning of the order parameter @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the distance between the @xmath21th ion with the coordinate @xmath22 and the @xmath1-axis .",
    "@xmath23 is the angle between the @xmath24 plane and the plane containing the @xmath1-axis and the point where the @xmath21th ion is located .",
    "diagram of the helical crystal along the @xmath1-axis with only one ion at point @xmath25 made visible .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "below the critical point the ion effectively moves in a wine bottle or a mexican hat potential , which is also illustrated on the diagram .",
    "above the critical point , the ion chain adopts a linear configuration in which the average value of @xmath28 vanishes and @xmath29 is undefined . ]",
    "the equation of motion for the order parameter , @xmath19 , can be obtained from ( [ eq : glenergy2 ] ) using the euler - lagrange equation and is given by    @xmath30    where we have also added a friction force , with a friction coefficient @xmath31 , and a stochastic force @xmath32 the friction force and the stochastic force come from the interaction of the ions with a cooling laser ( for further details check reference @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gliondynamics ] ) is known in the literature as the ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "it is extensively studied as it is one of the most important equations used to describe complex pattern formation . along with the more general complex gl equation",
    ", this equation is used to describe , for example , phenomena such as nonlinear waves , second - order phase transitions , superconductivity and bose - einstein condensation @xcite . equation ( [ eq : gliondynamics ] ) describes the second order phase transition at @xmath33 .",
    "substituting the plane wave solutions , @xmath34 , into the linearized equation ( [ eq : gliondynamics ] ) gives the dispersion relation    @xmath35    for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all @xmath39 i.e. all modes are decaying and the state of the system is stable . for @xmath40",
    "there are @xmath39 values for which @xmath41 ; these modes are unstable and will grow .",
    "the point @xmath33 is a critical point of as supercritical pitchfork bifurcation",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : glenergy2 ] ) arises naturally in physical systems where the order parameter has rotational symmetry .",
    "for example near the critical point , symmetry breaking in josephson tunnel junctions @xcite as well as bose - einstein condensation @xcite ( within a gross - pitaevskii description ) have the same dimensionality and symmetry properties as the linear to zigzag transition in ion trap . as a matter of fact",
    ", all these systems belong to the mean - field theory universality class .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gliondynamics ] ) allows for phase winding solutions , and crossing the structural transition leads to @xmath42 symmetry breaking , after which the ground state manifold is not simply connected , i.e. the first homotopy group of the manifold of degenerate ground states is @xmath43 , as in the formation of cosmic strings in the abelian higgs model @xcite and the examples above . with periodic boundary conditions",
    "the total phase must be equal to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an integer known as the winding number , i.e. @xmath46    the stability of the phase winding solutions was analyzed in a number of works , see for example @xcite .",
    "it is found that for each value of @xmath47 there are phase winding solutions that are unstable because their winding number is either too high or too low .",
    "when the number is too small , additional twist will form and when its too big then the twists will merge into one .",
    "the phase must be continuous and well defined whenever @xmath28 is not zero , so the winding number can only change discontinuously at some point in time and space where @xmath48 the scenario resembles the formation of fluxons in annular josephson tunnel junctions under a thermal quench , where the winding number in the experiments reported so far is severely restricted to @xmath49 ( trapping a single fluxon or anti - fluxon ) @xcite .",
    "it is also analogous to the creation of spontaneous quantized circulation in an atomic cloud undergoing bose - einstein condensation in a ring trap under a thermal quench @xcite .",
    "the aim of kz theory @xcite is to estimate the size of the domains that are formed when the the control parameter is quenched across the critical value . knowing the average size of the domains after the phase transition allows to estimate the number of defects ( e.g. domain walls ) . for the case of formation of helical structures",
    "it is also possible to use kz theory to estimate the winding number @xcite and this is the subject of this section .",
    "suppose that the transverse confinement is changed in such a way that the quench of the control parameter is linear in time with amplitude @xmath50 around the critical point @xmath51 $ ] , which is reached at @xmath52 @xmath53 where the ground state of the ion chain is linear for @xmath54 , and a zig - zag configuration with @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "if the quench is very slow i.e. @xmath57 , then the dynamics is adiabatic and we would expect to arrive at a state with the lowest possible @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the first mode that becomes unstable during the quench through the critical point is the mode with the smallest wave number , @xmath39 , ( or highest wavelength ) and , since the quench rate is very slow with respect to the spectral gap , other modes are not be excited . for a fast quench , @xmath58 ,",
    "the higher modes become unstable at a rate faster than the time it takes for the system to relax to the lowest mode configuration .",
    "this results in helices with a higher winding number .",
    "it is known that in the vicinity of the critical point ( @xmath59 ) the correlation length and relaxation time have power law divergences @xmath60 in terms of the dimensionless control parameter @xmath61 , and where the exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the critical exponents determined by the universality class to which the system belongs .",
    "the critical exponents for the linear to zigzag phase transition are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are those of a mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the kz mechanism splits the dynamics of the system into three stages : adiabatic when @xmath66 , frozen around the critical point @xmath67 , and adiabatic again once @xmath68 . within this impulse approximation the average size of the domains in the broken symmetry phase",
    "is given by the correlation length at the boundary between the adiabatic and impulse stages .",
    "the time scale , @xmath69 , at which adiabaticity breaks down is the so - called freeze - out time and it can be found by matching the relaxation time to the time remaining until the crossing of the critical point as imposed by the quench @xmath70 this reads @xmath71 this sets the average size of domains to @xmath72 in an ion chain with periodic boundary conditions the inter - ion spacing is homogeneous which leads to a constant critical frequency of the transverse confinement . as a result",
    ", the transition is crossed simultaneously all over the chain . otherwise , the argument above is to be modified to take into account the inhomogeneous nature of the ion chain @xcite , see as well @xcite .",
    "the domains can be thought of as regions where the angle , @xmath29 , is approximately constant .",
    "each domain will pick @xmath29 at random , therefore there will be about @xmath73 random variables , where @xmath74 is the length of the ion chain .",
    "let us assume that the random variables are uniformly distributed between @xmath75 and @xmath76 and thus have a mean of zero and a variance of @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution of the winding number , @xmath45 , is then a convolution of @xmath73 uniform random variables . for large @xmath74 ,",
    "the central limit theorem is valid and @xmath45 will have a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath78 .",
    "hence , the root mean square of the winding number inherits a dependence on the quench rate from equation ( [ eq : correlation_length ] ) , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for the ion chain ,",
    "the divergence of the correlation length derived from the two - point correlation function takes the form that @xmath81 and focusing on the overdamped regime ( @xmath82 ) the relaxation time is given by @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that the average absolute value of the winding number scales as @xmath84 in the following section we shall compare this prediction with the numerical solution of the set of coupled langevin equations describing the microscopic dynamics of the ion chain .",
    "in a single realization . the ion chain is prepared in a linear structural phase of circumference @xmath74 for which the order parameter @xmath85 vanishes up to thermal fluctuations , i.e. the average off - axis displacement of the ions is zero . as the transverse confinement is decreased during the quench , the system crosses the critical point and spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs , leading initially to the formation of different zigzag domains characterized by non - zero @xmath28 and the choice of an approximately constant value of @xmath29 associated with the plane on which the domain lies .",
    "the realization corresponds to the exact simulation of @xmath86 ions and a quench rate @xmath87 , the result is smeared in the surface plots to mimic a continuous field , @xmath19 . at longer times ( see figure [ fig : helices4](b ) ) the system relaxes to a helicoidal ion chain with non - zero winding number . [ fig : evolution ] ]    to study the dynamics of defect formation in the structural phase transition we solve the @xmath3 coupled langevin equations associated with equation ( [ eq : v1 ] ) in the presence of laser cooling .",
    "this is done in order to obtain reliable predictions for finite systems .",
    "we then compare the results with the predictions of the continuum field description in equation ( [ eq : gliondynamics ] ) , whose validity is restricted to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the protomol platform @xcite .",
    "protomol was already used before to study the dynamics of cold ion plasmas @xcite . the impulse integrator for langevin dynamics",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the coulomb forces were evaluated directly between all ions without any approximations .",
    "the numerical experiments were done as follows .",
    "@xmath86 ions are initially set to be equally spaced on the @xmath1-axis with zero velocity .",
    "the simulation is then run for 4@xmath88 timesteps , which was sufficient for the thermalization of the chain .",
    "then , the transverse frequency is decreased linearly between an initial ( @xmath89 ) and final ( @xmath90 ) value across the critical point @xmath91 in a time @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to the effective @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "the simulation is continued at the final transverse trapping frequency for another 8@xmath88 timesteps which ensures relaxation of the ion chain to a configuration in which the winding number stays constant .",
    "the characteristic frequency of the system is obtained by comparing the coulomb energy and the trapping energy and is given by @xmath95 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the ion and @xmath11 is the spacing between the ions . in terms of @xmath96 the parameters used in the simulation were @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the evolution of the order parameter @xmath85 in a typical run is shown in figure [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "we observe the formation of correlations near the critical point which leads to regions of zigzag chain at constant orientation @xmath29 .",
    "we can also see points were the displacement of ions , @xmath28 , stays zero for considerable time even after the system is quenched through the critical point . at these",
    "` phase slip centres ' the phase @xmath29 is undefined and so it can ` slip ' by 2@xmath76 changing the winding number .",
    "we have carried out simulations of the long time dynamics of the helical chain in order to check whether the winding number stays constant .",
    "it is observed that the winding number can change shortly after crossing the critical point and that it eventually stabilizes .",
    "just after crossing the critical point the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath19 is small enough for the thermal fluctuations to bring it to @xmath101 at a certain position @xmath1 .",
    "this facilitates phase slips that unwind the chain and minimize its coulomb energy .",
    "figure [ fig : helices4 ] illustrates the decay of a @xmath102 to a @xmath103 configuration .",
    "the non - universal nature of this process is beyond the scope of the kzm , and deviations between the observed averaging winding number and the kzm prediction are expected whenever the decay induced by thermal fluctuations plays a relevant role .",
    "simulations were carried out for 27 different quench rates .",
    "the number of runs for each quench rate was @xmath1042000 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : scaling ] .",
    "the dispersion of the resulting winding number @xmath45 exhibits a dependence on the quench rate which is well captured by the power - law predicted by the kzm .",
    "a quantitative agreement is found for slow to moderate quench rates i.e. @xmath105 . while kzm captures the right dependence on the parameters of the system and the quench , as can be seen by comparison of the kzm prediction in equation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) with the results of the simulations , we find that kzm overestimates the winding number by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the kzm prediction generally surpasses the observed density of defects by a factor of up to an order of magnitude , as has been observed in a variety of systems @xcite , including ion chains @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the scaling breaks down for faster quenches due to a saturation of @xmath107 resulting from finite size of the chain which leads to a broadening of the distribution .",
    "ion chains with periodic boundary conditions undergoing the linear to zigzag structural transition in the presence of laser cooling constitute an experimentally attractive platform for studying the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the critical point is well characterized and the transition can be driven by weakening the transverse confinement at a given quench rate .",
    "we have shown that at an early stage of the quench , the resulting chain exhibits multiple zigzag domains oriented along different planes in the transverse direction . in a subsequent stage , the topology of the trap forces the system to relax to a helical ion chain with a given winding number which depends on the quench rate .",
    "furthermore , this dependence agrees quantitatively with the power - law predicted by the kibble - zurek mechanism with mean - field critical exponents for moderate rates . at high",
    "quench rates the winding number saturates leading to a breakdown of the scaling .",
    "this work shows once more that ion crystals are very well suited classical simulators of complex and critical dynamics , from condensed matter to cosmological models .",
