    "dark energy is the name of the unknown component responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in its simpler form ,",
    "this can be described by a fluid with constant equation of state parameter @xmath0 , corresponding to a cosmological constant , leading to the successful @xmath1cdm model , the simplest model that fits a varied set of observational data .",
    "this model posses a high dependence to initial conditions that makes it unnatural in many ways .",
    "for example , the current value for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are of the same order of magnitude , a fact highly improbable , because the dark matter contribution decreases with @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the scale factor , meanwhile the cosmological constant contribution have had the same value always . this problem in particular",
    "is known as the cosmic coincidence problem . in this context ,",
    "the most natural way to understand the acceleration of the universe , is to assume the existence of a dynamical cosmological constant , or a theoretical model with a dynamical equation of state parameter ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the source of this dynamical _ dark energy _ could be both , a new field component filling the universe , as a quintessence scalar field @xcite , or it can be produced by modifying gravity @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggested that the current observational data favor a scenario in which the acceleration of the expansion has past a maximum value and is now decelerating . the key point in deriving this conclusion is the use of the chevalier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite , @xcite for a dynamical equation of state parameter @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants to be fixed by observations and @xmath10 is the scale factor .",
    "an update analysis performed using recent snia data was informed in @xcite where similar conclusions were derived .",
    "both analysis assume a flat universe . in @xcite",
    ", we study the previous model , using a new set of data , the union 2 data set @xcite , and also considering the possibility to incorporate the curvature parameter @xmath11 , as a new free parameter in the analysis .",
    "we find that , the three observational test ; snia , bao and cmb , all can be accommodated in the same trend , assuming a very small value for the curvature , @xmath12 .",
    "the best fit values suggest that the acceleration of the universe has already reached its maximum , and is currently moving towards a decelerating phase . using a scalar field to model dark energy ,",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the scalar field potential from observations .",
    "there are many approaches to do this @xcite .",
    "considering models of a single non - minimally coupled scalar field , the rapid variations of the equation of state parameter at low redshift can not be described .",
    "the quest for the unification of inflation , dark matter , and dark energy , in different combinations , by a single field , has been studied in refs .",
    "the main motivation behind all proposals is that we do not yet understand the nature of the components responsible for the three phenomena , but we do know that their special properties are beyond the realm of the ordinary matter described by the standard model of particle physics .",
    "an extreme , most economical , possibility is that all three phenomena can be explained by the existence of one single field . as was first put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplest option at hand is a scalar field @xmath13 with a potential of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the energy scale @xmath15 is to be set at the tiny value of the observed cosmological constant considered in the concordance @xmath1cdm model , and the mass scale of the field , @xmath16 , is determined by the amplitude of primordial perturbations generated during inflation .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore the consequences of this trend , suggested from the observations , and look for special features through a characterization of a unification model based on a scalar field , that allows these transitions at low redshift .",
    "the reconstruction program uses as an intermediate phase a certain parametrization of @xmath17 , which after its test using the data , is slightly altered looking for improvements in the fit .",
    "here we use a @xmath18 test considering the aic and bic criteria that controls the number of parameters to be used .",
    "the problem of extracting information of @xmath17 from observations can be understand in the following way . because most of the measurements give us information of the hubble function @xmath19 or also the luminosity ( or angular diameter ) distance @xmath20 , we are forced to use @xmath21 in the case of data from @xmath19 , and we are forced to use @xmath22 in the case of the luminosity distance , where @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the precision in values for @xmath24 and @xmath11 are crucial in this reconstruction procedure .",
    "the limitations of this process , first identified in @xcite , are related to the dependence of the function @xmath17 of first and second derivatives of the @xmath19 and @xmath25 functions respectively . in order to tackle this problem ,",
    "we can try to model the @xmath17 shape , by using a proper parametrization .",
    "the most used is the already mentioned cpl @xcite , @xcite , but there are many others designed to specific goals .",
    "for example , to describe a fast transition at redshift @xmath26 we can use @xmath27 or if we are interested in oscillatory behaviour we can use @xmath28 however , there is a concern regarding the number of parameters used to parameterize @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that increasing the number of parameters @xcite , is easiest to improve the fit with observations , but is not clear if in the meantime we are adjusting noise , instead of the truly physical relation .",
    "in this section we describe the method to reconstruct the scalar field potential through the use of a iterative program improving the fit using two parameterizations for the equation of state parameter @xmath17 . in this section",
    "we assume that @xmath29 .",
    "the comoving distance from the observer to redshift @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the snia data give the luminosity distance @xmath34 .",
    "we fit the snia with the cosmological model by minimizing the @xmath18 value defined by @xmath35 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\mu i}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 + 25 $ ] is the theoretical value of the distance modulus , and @xmath37 is the corresponding observed one .",
    "the bao data considered in our analysis is the distance ratio obtained at @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the joint analysis of the 2df galaxy redsihft survey and sdss data @xcite , that can be expressed as @xmath40 with @xmath41^{1/3}.\\ ] ] we fit the cosmological model minimizing the @xmath18 defined by @xmath42 ^ 2}{0.065 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] a result from the combination of snia and bao is given by a joint analysis finding the best fit parameters that minimize @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we can incorporate to the analysis the cmb redshift parameter @xcite , which is the reduce distance at @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45 we also apply the @xmath18 @xmath46 ^ 2}{0.019 ^ 2}\\;,\\ ] ] to find out the result from cmb and the constraints from snia+bao+cmb are given by @xmath47 .    assuming a form for @xmath17 in terms of a certain number of parameters , we perform a bayesian analysis to obtain the best fit values of all the free parameters in the model .",
    "for example , using the cpl parametrization , @xmath48 , the function defined in ( [ edez ] ) leads to @xmath49 using the union 2 set @xcite , consisting in @xmath50 type ia supernovae , the analysis leads to the results shown in table [ tab : table01 ] .",

    "as is expected , in the cases snia and snia+bao , we observe a rapid change in slope , a `` knee '' feature , that is not observed in the case including cmb",

    "this is the anomalous effect mentioned first in @xcite using the constitution data set for snia , and also in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a large negative value for @xmath9 means that for small redshift the data suggest a negative slope for @xmath17 . because we are using the cpl parametrization",
    ", this fact spoils the large @xmath30 behavior of the eos parameter , leading to a large negative values @xmath55 .",
    "this is the kind of small redshift transitions in @xmath17 that were discussed first in @xcite and also in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they use a form , @xmath56 that captures the essence of a single transition at @xmath26 in a range @xmath57 , from @xmath8 initially to a final value @xmath58 in the future . in @xcite",
    "the authors discussed the possibility of a fast change in @xmath17 at @xmath59 and its implication for a standard scalar field model .",
    "they found that while a canonical scalar field model can decrease the expansion rate at low redshift , increasing the local expansion rate requires a non - canonical kinetic term for the scalar field . in this work we present an analysis of this problem using real data , as opposite to the previous analysis , to constraint the form of the equation of state parameter @xmath17 and then through relations ( [ reconst ] ) to constraint the scalar field potential @xmath54 in a unified dark matter dark energy model",
    "as is evident from the previous section , the results show the incompatibility of the cpl parametrization in describing the variation of @xmath17 with redshift , because the data suggest a very large and negative value for @xmath9 which spoils the large @xmath30 behavior of @xmath17 . in order to improve the fit ,",
    "some authors have suggested the use of a new parametrization @xcite for @xmath17 .",
    "we can use for example , the fast single transition form ( [ w2 ] ) , to improve the fit .",
    "however , this parametrization has four parameters , two more than the cpl . adding a new parameter would be justifiable only if the aic or bic ( or a combination of these two ) numbers indicate so @xcite . in this context",
    ", if we do not have new insight , we would like to keep the number of parameters fixed ( in this case two ) , until one of these numbers ( aic or bic ) indicated something else .",
    "let us start with a first iteration of the process .",
    "the negative value for @xmath9 obtained in the previous section indicate that @xmath17 has to change its slope recently , and as the cpl reproduce perfectly , at large @xmath30 its value does not change very much .",
    "so , let us use the following ansatz for @xmath17 : @xmath60 this form has two parameters , like the cpl , so they are both directly comparable with @xmath18 statistic , and also this has a dust limit for @xmath61 .",
    "the main feature of this parametrization is that allows the possibility to describe a change of @xmath17 at low @xmath30 , without spoiling the large @xmath30 behavior .",
    "the result of a bayesian analysis is displayed in table [ tab : table02 ] .",
