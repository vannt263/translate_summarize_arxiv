    "after @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the most abundant nucleus in a @xmath4 white dwarf ( wd ) interior is @xmath0 . as the slowest step in the cno cycle is the @xmath5 reaction , almost all cno nuclei end up as @xmath6 at the end of h burning . during the he burning stage , the reaction @xmath7 processes all @xmath6 into @xmath0 . for recently formed wds of @xmath4",
    "this results in a @xmath0 mass fraction @xmath8 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0 has a mass to charge ratio , @xmath9 greater than that of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , this affects the dynamics of @xmath0 nuclei in the following manner . in the degenerate wd interior",
    ", there exists an upward pointing electric field of magnitude @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath1 being the local gravitational acceleration . the resulting net force on @xmath0 , @xmath11 , biases @xmath0 s diffusion inward .",
    "in contrast , the predominant @xmath2 and @xmath3 ions experience no net force",
    ". the resulting sedimentation of @xmath0 will impact the cooling history and seismology of the wd .",
    "the @xmath0 evolution is governed by mass continuity @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the local @xmath0 density and flux respectively .",
    "the flux is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is @xmath17 s diffusion coefficient in the background plasma and @xmath18 is the magnitude of its local drift velocity . @xmath16 and @xmath18 are related via the stokes - einstein equation : @xmath19 .    as discussed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", @xmath16 is not well known for conditions in the wd interior .",
    "so , for this work , we took as a starting point the self diffusion coefficient of the one - component plasma , @xmath20 , as calculated in @xcite,@xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the inter - ion spacing of the background ions . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the plasma crystallizes @xcite .",
    "we quantify the effects of the uncertainty of @xmath16 on our results by performing calculations with varying @xmath16 .",
    "we simultaneously evolve the initially constant @xmath26 and wd core temperature , @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 evolution is modeled as above .",
    "we halt sedimentation in the solid phase .",
    "we consider the wd interior to be isothermal , and calculate @xmath28 using @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the heat capacity , @xmath31 is the wd luminosity , @xmath32 the power generated by @xmath0 sinking , @xmath33 is the latent heat released per nucleon , and @xmath34 is the mass of the wd that has crystallized .",
    "@xmath31 is determined from the @xmath35 relations of @xcite and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "we ignore fractionation effects . finally ,",
    "throughout we utilize background wd models composed of a single ion species , representing realistic c / o wd compositions by taking @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "= 3.0 in    the overall impact of @xmath0 sedimentation on the wd age depends on the diffusion rate and when the wd crystallizes . sinking is fast in massive wds , but crystallization occurs earlier , somewhat mitigating the impact .",
    "the opposite is the case for low mass wds , where sedimentation is slower , but can continue for up to 10 gyrs .",
    "@xmath0 content is also a factor , as @xmath32 depends on the @xmath26 .",
    "= 3.0 in    figure [ fig : ltzcomp ] shows cooling curves for a @xmath40 wd model , comparing differing values of @xmath16 and @xmath26 .",
    "the higher metallicity is that of ngc 6791 , a metal rich , old ( @xmath41 gyr ) open cluster @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : obscon ] details the expected cmd location of wds in ngc 6791 today assuming several values of @xmath16 , demonstrating how observations can constrain on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the gradient in @xmath0 abundance creates a gradient in the mean molecular weight per electron , @xmath42 , that provides an extra restoring force for the g - modes in the wd interior .",
    "we can approximate the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath43 , in this case by considering an isothermal plasma of degenerate , relativistic electrons and ideal ion gas with a @xmath42 gradient due to @xmath26 gradients .",
    "doing so , we find ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the ion mean molecular weight .",
    "the first piece is the thermal contribution to @xmath43 while the second is the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "we estimate the impact of @xmath0 on the mode frequencies by performing the integral @xmath47 through the liquid wd interior ( the envelope s contribution to the integral is @xmath48 ) .",
    "neglecting the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath43 gives @xmath49 through the wd core , while taking into account the @xmath0 gradient gives @xmath50 for @xmath51 . including the envelope contribution shows @xmath0 can impact mode periods by more than 1% , a level over 100 times larger than the measurement errors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , if meaningful results are to be inferred from wd pulsation studies , @xmath0 gradients need to be taken into account .      99 althaus , l. & benvenuto , o. , 1989 mnras 296 , 206 bildsten , l. & hall , d. , 2001 , apj , 549 , l219 bradley , p. a. 2001 , apj , 552 , 32 bravo , e. , isern , j. , canal , r. , & labay , j. , 1992 , a&a , 257 , 534 chaboyer , b. , green , e. , & liebert , j. , 1999 , aj , 117 , 1360 deloye , c.j . , &",
