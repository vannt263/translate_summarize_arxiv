    "this paper deals with periodic bps monopoles , namely yang - mills - higgs fields @xmath3 on @xmath0 satisfying the bogomolny equations .",
    "a useful tool for understanding systems of this type is the generalized nahm transform .",
    "the best - known nahm transform describes bps monopoles on @xmath4 in terms of solutions of a set of ordinary differential equations , namely the nahm equations . but",
    "this is part of a more general picture ( which also includes the adhm transform for self - dual yang - mills instantons ) : a generalized nahm transform , which may be understood in terms of the reciprocity between self - dual yang - mills equations on dual 4-tori @xcite .",
    "suitable rescalings of the tori ( and corresponding dimensional reductions of the self - duality equations ) then give , as special cases , the adhm transform and the nahm transform for monopoles on @xmath4 , as well as several other systems including the present one .",
    "the general scheme suggests that the nahm transforms of bps monopoles on @xmath0 are solutions of the hitchin equations on the cylinder @xmath1 ( satisfying appropriate boundary conditions ) , where the two circles are dual to each other .",
    "this was confirmed in @xcite , where many of the details were worked out .    in this paper , we focus on the case of periodic 2-monopole fields with gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "such fields may also be visualized as a pair of infinite monopole chains .",
    "by contrast with the case of monopoles in @xmath4 , the system as a whole is infinitely massive , so its centre - of - mass and overall phase are parameters which must be kept fixed @xcite . however , the _ relative _ separation and phase of the monopoles are free to vary .",
    "so we focus on the relative moduli space @xmath2 of solutions : this is a 4-dimensional manifold equipped with a natural hyperkhler metric .",
    "the geodesics in @xmath2 are of particular interest , as they correspond to slow - motion dynamics of the system .",
    "our purpose is to study the geometry of @xmath2 in the nahm - transformed picture , _ ie . _  in terms of structures on the cylinder @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of monopoles in this system is different from that of the well - known case of monopoles on @xmath4 , owing to the periodicity .",
    "although the metric on @xmath2 is not known explicitly , one can identify some geodesics as fixed - point sets of discrete symmetries , and this provides examples of such novel dynamics .    for the space @xmath0 on which the monopole fields @xmath3 live ,",
    "we use coordinates @xmath5 , with @xmath6 having period @xmath7 .",
    "so the gauge potential @xmath8 and the higgs field @xmath9 are smooth functions of @xmath5 , periodic in @xmath6 , and they satisfy the bogomolny equations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the gauge field .",
    "the monopoles are located , roughly speaking , at the zeros of @xmath9 . for monopole fields of charge  2 , the boundary behaviour in the non - periodic directions , _ ie . _  as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , is @xmath14 locally in some gauge . here",
    "@xmath15 is a positive constant which determines the monopole size , or more accurately the ratio between the monopole size and the @xmath6-period .",
    "the @xmath16 limit corresponds to monopoles on @xmath4 ; the opposite extreme @xmath17 , where the monopoles spread out , is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "note that the system is not rotationally - symmetric about the @xmath6-axis : this is reflected in the boundary condition for @xmath18 .",
    "it does , however , admit the discrete symmetry of rotations by @xmath19 about the @xmath6-axis , which can be compensated by a periodic gauge transformation .    such monopole fields ( or rather , the subset of centred monopole fields )",
    "correspond , via the nahm transform @xcite , to the following nahm / hitchin data on @xmath1 .",
    "as coordinates on @xmath1 , take @xmath20 and @xmath21 with period  @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the complex coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "the fields on @xmath1 consist of a gauge potential @xmath25 with the gauge group in this case being su(2 ) , and a complex higgs field @xmath26 in the adjoint representation .",
    "the gauge field @xmath27 is simply written as @xmath28 .",
    "these fields satisfy the hitchin equations @xmath29.\\ ] ] here @xmath30 $ ] , and @xmath31 denotes the complex conjugate transpose of @xmath26 .",
    "the field @xmath26 is constrained by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is some complex constant , and the boundary condition is @xmath34 as @xmath35 .    in general",
    ", for a periodic @xmath36-monopole system , the nahm / hitchin data would be @xmath37-valued . in our case , @xmath38 .",
    "the significance of the fields @xmath39 being @xmath40-valued , rather than @xmath41-valued , is that the corresponding two - monopole system is centred , with its centre - of - mass fixed at the point @xmath42 .",
    "as noted above , we are only interested in the relative separation of the monopoles , and so we restrict to @xmath40 .    actually , one may equally regard the centre - of - mass as being located at the point @xmath43 , since the distinction between these two possibilities is ambiguous in view of the @xmath6-periodicity .",
    "there is a natural map @xmath44 which translates a monopole solution by @xmath19 in the @xmath6-direction , and which therefore interchages these two centring points .",
    "the corresponding map on @xmath45 consists of gauging by an antiperiodic gauge transformation , _ ie . _  by @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this preserves the periodicity of @xmath45 as well as the equations ( [ hit ] ) and the boundary conditions .",
    "clearly the fixed points of @xmath44 consist precisely of the fields which are 1-monopole chains in disguise , _ ie .",
    "_  periodic 1-monopole solutions taken over two periods .",
    "there are exactly two such solutions , up to gauge - equivalence : their nahm / hitchin data can be written as @xmath49 ,    \\quad a_r=0 , \\quad a_t=({{\\mathrm{i}}}\\pi/2)\\sigma_1,\\ ] ] and they have @xmath50 respectively .    no other solutions of ( [ hit ] ) , with these boundary conditions , are known explicitly .",
    "one way of solving the equations numerically is by minimizing an `` energy '' functional , and we implemented this in order to get an idea of what the fields look like .",
    "briefly , the details are as follows . define @xmath51|^2.\\ ] ] the @xmath52-cutoff @xmath53 has to be finite for the integral to converge , but in practice it does not have to be large , since the solutions are well localized . then there is a bogomolny - type bound on @xmath54 , and this bound is saturated if and only if the hitchin equations ( [ hit ] ) are satisfied . so minimizing @xmath54",
    "numerically gives a solution .    in the next section ,",
    "we identify the four moduli in terms of the fields @xmath39 , at least in the asymptotic region of the moduli space .",
    "then in section  [ sec3 ] , we derive the asymptotic metric on @xmath2 by direct calculation , and see that it agrees with the metric previously derived by considering the forces between monopoles @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] describes various geodesic surfaces in @xmath2 , and this is followed by a discussion of geodesics and the associated monopole dynamics in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the moduli space @xmath2 is 4-dimensional , and the aim here is to describe the four moduli in terms of the nahm / hitchin data .",
    "two of the moduli are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number @xmath33 appearing in the constraint ( [ detphi ] ) .",
    "we shall describe the remaining two moduli in the asymptotic region of @xmath2 , which is where @xmath55 ; this corresponds to the monopoles being widely - separated .",
    "numerical solutions , obtained as outlined above , indicate that the data @xmath39 then resemble two well separated lumps on the cylinder , located at the zeros @xmath56 of @xmath57 . by this",
    "we mean that the gauge field @xmath28 is close to zero except at these two points , and the peaks at @xmath58 become more concentrated as @xmath59 increases . in particular , since @xmath60 in the central region @xmath61 , it makes sense to consider the @xmath21-holonomy there , and we define an angle @xmath62 by @xmath63 the two monopoles are located @xcite on @xmath64 , and @xmath62 determines their @xmath6-offset : the @xmath6-coordinates of the monopoles are @xmath65 respectively , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "the sign ambiguity in the square root reflects the indistinguishability of the monopoles .",
    "the equation ( [ theta ] ) only determines @xmath62 up to sign , but we may remove this ambiguity by using the higgs field @xmath26 , and regard @xmath66 $ ] as periodic with period @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , @xmath62 is really a local coordinate on a @xmath67-twisted circle bundle over the asymptotic @xmath33-space , and the definition of its sign is a matter of choice . here",
    "is one particular scheme , using the value @xmath68 of @xmath26 at @xmath69 .",
    "the quantity @xmath70 is a gauge - invariant complex number . if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 is non - zero , and it follows from @xmath73 that    * if @xmath74 , then @xmath75 , and we can define @xmath76 ; * if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 , and we can define @xmath79 .    if we write @xmath80 , then @xmath62 changes sign as @xmath81 goes from @xmath82 to @xmath22 , _ ie _  as one goes around a loop in the asymptotic @xmath33-space .",
    "in fact , with this particular scheme , the jump occurs as @xmath81 crosses @xmath83 .",
    "finally , let us turn to the fourth modulus , @xmath84 , which corresponds to a relative phase between the two monopoles .",
    "it also correponds to a relative phase between the two lumps on the cylinder .",
    "define @xmath85 : in other words , the @xmath86 are the directions in the lie algebra of the gauge field at the two peaks .",
    "then we define @xmath84 to be the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath88 is obtained by parallel - propagating @xmath89 from @xmath90 to @xmath91 using @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath93 is a path between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for large @xmath59",
    "this formulation is path independent ( up to winding round the cylinder ) as the field strength vanishes between the peaks .",
    "this only defines @xmath84 up to sign , but the ambiguity may be resolved as before , this time using the quantity @xmath94 .",
    "so @xmath95 $ ] has period @xmath7 .    since @xmath34 as @xmath35 , it is also natural to consider the holonomies at infinity , namely @xmath96 it follows from the equations and boundary conditions that @xmath97 , so the @xmath98 individually contain no gauge - invariant information .",
    "but the angle between them does : for example , let @xmath99 be the element of su(2 ) obtained by parallel - propagating @xmath100 along @xmath101 from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , and define @xmath104 by @xmath105 .",
    "this quantity @xmath104 is related to @xmath84 by @xmath106 ( modulo integer multiples of @xmath7 ) .",
    "by contrast with @xmath84 , the definition of @xmath104 is valid throughout @xmath2 , and not just in the asymptotic region .",
    "in particular , for the special solutions ( [ specialpoints ] ) , which are not in the asymptotic region , we can compute @xmath98 exactly , and this shows that the fields ( [ specialpoints ] ) have @xmath107 .",
    "the natural hyperkhler metric on @xmath2 is believed to have no continuous symmetries , and it is not known explicitly .",
    "the asymptotic metric , however , has a fairly simple form .",
    "it was derived in @xcite by studying the effective lagrangian of the 2-monopole system , in other words the forces between well separated monopoles . in this section , we see that this asymptotic metric can be calculated directly in terms of the nahm / hitchin data . in particular , this shows us how to identify the moduli of the previous section with the  monopole - based \" moduli used in @xcite .",
    "let us think of a tangent vector in @xmath2 , at the point corresponding to the solution @xmath39 , as a perturbation @xmath108 which preserves the equations ( [ hit ] ) , and also satisfies the condition @xmath109+[\\phi^*,\\delta\\phi]\\ ] ] for the perturbation to be orthogonal to the gauge orbits at @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the combined equations on @xmath108 are equivalent to the pair @xmath112 , \\quad    [ \\phi,\\delta\\phi^*]=4d_{{\\bar{s}}}(\\delta a_s).\\ ] ] in addition to these differential equations ( [ perturbation ] ) , one also needs boundary conditions @xmath113 , @xmath114 as @xmath115 , and the constraint @xmath116 .",
    "the norm - squared of the vector @xmath117 is then defined to be @xmath118\\,dr\\,dt,\\ ] ] and this gives the metric on @xmath2 .",
    "note that if @xmath119 is one solution of ( [ perturbation ] ) , then so are each of @xmath120 furthermore , these four vectors are orthogonal with the same norm ; in other words , @xmath121 for some real constant @xmath122 .",
    "suppose that @xmath123 corresponds to the increments @xmath124 in the moduli , where @xmath125 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 ; and similarly for the other @xmath126 .",
    "define the @xmath127 matrix @xmath128 by @xmath129.\\ ] ] then the coefficients of the metric on @xmath2 , with respect to the local coordinates @xmath130 , are the entries in the matrix @xmath131 .    in the asymptotic region @xmath55",
    ", there is a crude but effective approximate solution @xmath39 , namely @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "there are branch cuts along @xmath134 and @xmath135 , on which @xmath136 , and ( [ singularsoln ] ) is a solution everywhere except at the two singular points @xmath58 .",
    "numerics indicate that it is a good approximation , for large @xmath59 , to the actual smooth solutions , except very close to the singular points .",
    "the gauge field consists , in effect , of delta - functions at the singular points , and we complete the approximate description of the field by simply assigning elements @xmath86 of @xmath40 , orthogonal to @xmath137 , to these two points .",
    "the moduli @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath62 appear explicitly in ( [ singularsoln ] ) , and @xmath84 is the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath89 .    to keep things simple in what follows ,",
    "let us restrict to the case @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath62 and @xmath84 are twisted rather than global coordinates , one obtains the complete picture by doing the case @xmath77 as well , and then patching things together in an appropriate way .",
    "let @xmath123 be the perturbation @xmath141 , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 , and @xmath144 is a small parameter .",
    "this satisfies ( [ perturbation ] ) and the associated boundary conditions , except at the singularities .",
    "note that @xmath145 , where @xmath146 the corresponding variations in the moduli are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "following the pattern described above , the next perturbation @xmath149 is @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and this has @xmath152 , @xmath153 .    for @xmath154",
    "we get @xmath155 , whence @xmath156 ; and @xmath157 .",
    "thus @xmath158 and @xmath159 , from which one directly computes @xmath160 , where @xmath161 the perturbation @xmath154 does not affect @xmath162 ( this has been checked with numerical examples ) , so a variation of @xmath84 arises only from the change of @xmath163 along the path between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath164 $ ] , where @xmath165 ( recall that @xmath166 is defined by @xmath80 ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath167 we have @xmath168 and @xmath169 ; and the corresponding variations in the moduli are @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "note that the ` knock - on ' effect of one perturbation on another has been ignored , and indeed for large @xmath59 such terms only make relatively small contributions to the metric .",
    "the next step is to compute the leading terms in the integrals @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath55 .",
    "these are obtained from the approximation @xmath175 for @xmath176 , @xmath177 for @xmath178 , which gives @xmath179 as @xmath180 .",
    "then it is straightforward to calculate the asymptotic metric as described above , via the matrix @xmath128 , and we get @xmath181 now the asymptotic metric @xmath182 of @xcite , which was computed by considering the forces between monopoles , is given by @xmath183 where @xmath5 is the location of one of the monopoles relative to the centre of mass , and @xmath184 is a relative phase with period @xmath19 .",
    "the functions @xmath185 and @xmath186 are defined by @xmath187 where @xmath188 , with @xmath189 being some constant .",
    "we already know @xcite that @xmath190 ; and it is straightforward to check that the metrics ( [ asympmetric ] ) and ( [ ckmetric ] ) agree , up to an overall factor of @xmath191 , if we make the identification @xmath192 and @xmath193 . in particular , therefore , @xmath194 is the @xmath6-offset of the monopoles .",
    "the geometry of the moduli space @xmath2 , and in particular its geodesics , correspond to the dynamics of monopole systems in situations where radiative losses are small , and in particular when speeds are small @xcite . not knowing the metric explicitly means that we can not find many geodesics exactly ; but some can be obtained as fixed - point sets of discrete symmetries of @xmath2 .",
    "the first step , as in the familiar @xmath4 case @xcite , is to identify geodesic surfaces in @xmath2 ; we do this by looking for discrete symmetries of the system ( [ hit ] , [ detphi ] ) .",
    "the most obvious symmetry is @xmath195 in the monopole picture , ( [ phi_to - phi ] ) corresponds to rotation by @xmath19 about the @xmath6-axis .",
    "let @xmath196 denote the fixed - point set of ( [ phi_to - phi ] ) .",
    "since @xmath33 is preserved , ( [ phi_to - phi ] ) acts only on the other two moduli @xmath62 and @xmath104 ( for this section , it is more convenient to use @xmath104 than @xmath84 ) . from the discussion of signs in section  [ sec2 ] , it is clear that the effect of ( [ phi_to - phi ] ) is @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "thus asymptotically , @xmath196 has four disconnected components , corresponding to @xmath199 . in this asymptotic regime",
    ", we see a pair of monopoles , located at the points @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and with their phases either aligned or anti - aligned depending on @xmath104 .",
    "the question now is what @xmath196 looks like globally , not just asymptotically .",
    "as described in @xcite , the solutions belonging to @xmath196 take a simplified form : there exists a gauge in which @xmath200 where @xmath28 , @xmath186 and @xmath201 are complex - valued functions .",
    "the constraint on @xmath57 is @xmath202 $ ] , and the hitchin equations become @xmath203 together with @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the laplacian .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath206 as @xmath35 , and the solutions have the symmetry @xmath207 the remaining gauge freedom consists of @xmath208 where @xmath209 is periodic and of unit modulus .",
    "taking account of this gauge freedom , it is easy to see that there are four classes of solution of ( [ hweqns ] ) : @xmath28  could have one zero or none ; and @xmath210 , where @xmath36 is either @xmath82 or @xmath22 .",
    "as we shall see below , these four possibilities correspond to the four asymptotic components of @xmath196 .",
    "let us begin by studying one of these cases in detail , namely where @xmath28 has no zeros and @xmath211 .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath28 has the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a complex - valued periodic function .",
    "if we write @xmath214 for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath213 , then @xmath215 , and therefore the holonomy at @xmath52 is @xmath216.\\ ] ] the boundary condition says that @xmath217 as @xmath35 , so the holonomies at the two ends are @xmath218 , and hence @xmath219 . to compute @xmath62 , note that the symmetry ( [ f - symmetry ] ) implies @xmath220 ; it follows that @xmath221 and so @xmath222 .    for @xmath28 of the form ( [ forma ] ) , the equation ( [ hweqns ] ) becomes @xmath223 which has a unique solution for each value of @xmath224 .",
    "so this case gives one of the components @xmath225 of @xmath196 , namely the one corresponding to @xmath222 , @xmath219 ; and @xmath225 is diffeomorphic to @xmath226 . with its natural metric ( the restriction of the metric on @xmath2 )",
    ", the surface @xmath225 is a deformed version of the atiyah - hitchin cone @xcite , having no continuous symmetries ( unlike the atiyah - hitchin cone itself , which is rotationally - symmetric ) .",
    "the metric on @xmath225 may be calculated numerically , and this is instructive in that it shows the effect of varying the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the procedure is as follows",
    ".    given complex numbers @xmath33 and @xmath227 , with @xmath227 small , we solve ( [ alpha - eqn ] ) numerically for @xmath33 and for @xmath228 , giving real functions @xmath229 and @xmath230 respectively .",
    "this may be done by minimizing an appropriate functional of @xmath229 , as described in @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath231 , so @xmath232 is real - valued : this is just a gauge choice . however , setting @xmath233 as well leads to a perturbation @xmath108 which does not satisfy the gauge - orthogonality condition ( [ gaugecondition ] ) .",
    "so we need to use @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is determined by the requirement that @xmath236 be orthogonal to the gauge orbits at @xmath232 .",
    "this is just a linear equation for @xmath235 , having a unique solution , and is straightforward to solve numerically .",
    "the final step then uses ( [ metricintegral ] ) to evaluate @xmath237 , and hence gives the metric on @xmath225 .",
    "this metric has the form @xmath238 , and we know from ( [ asympmetric ] ) that @xmath239 the upper plots in figure  [ fig1 ] show @xmath240 on @xmath241 , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 respectively .",
    "the corresponding lower plots are rough sketches of the surface , obtained by computing the gaussian curvature numerically from @xmath244 and then finding an embedded surface in @xmath4 with that curvature .",
    "we see that for @xmath242 , the surface has approximate rotational symmetry , as one would expect since it should approach the atiyah - hitchin cone as @xmath16 . for larger",
    "@xmath15 , however , the lack of symmetry becomes apparent , with the cone becoming stretched in the @xmath138-direction .     on the geodesic surface @xmath225 , and sketches of the surface , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 . ]",
    "we next consider the component of @xmath196 corresponding to the case where @xmath28 has no zeros and @xmath245 . the corresponding geodesic surface @xmath246 is isometric to @xmath225 : in fact , the isometry is the map @xmath44 .",
    "the action of @xmath44 amounts to gauging by the antiperiodic transformation @xmath247 , and the effect of this on the moduli is @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 .",
    "so in particular , @xmath246 has @xmath251 .    for the two remaining cases",
    ", @xmath28 has a zero , which has to be one of the zeros of @xmath252 .",
    "then @xmath28 has either of the two forms @xmath253 where @xmath254 and we take the branch of the square root such that @xmath255 .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath256 as @xmath115 , @xmath257 as @xmath258 .",
    "these classes ( [ formc ] , [ formd ] ) both have @xmath107 , and they have @xmath259 respectively .",
    "they are interchanged by the map  @xmath44 .",
    "however , each class contains the two special solutions ( [ specialpoints ] ) , which are the fixed points of  @xmath44 .",
    "so in fact we get a single component @xmath260 of @xmath196 , consisting of two copies of the @xmath33-plane branched over the points @xmath50 . in effect , interchanging the two branches of the square root in ( [ mu ] ) interchanges the forms ( [ formc ] ) and ( [ formd ] ) . the single surface @xmath260 has two asymptotic regions , each of which is cone - like :",
    "so the picture may be described as a double - trumpet , by contrast with the atiyah - hitchin trumpet of the @xmath4 case @xcite .",
    "the metric on @xmath260 has no continuous symmetries , but has an approximate rotational symmetry ( about the axis of the trumpet ) for small @xmath15 .    the second expression in ( [ mu",
    "] ) is just the usual conformal mapping @xmath261 , and this gives us a global coordinate @xmath262 on @xmath260 . given @xmath263 , we take the field to be determined by ( [ formd ] ) . if @xmath264 it lies on the sheet @xmath265 , while if @xmath266 it lies on the sheet @xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath33-plane is cut on the line segment @xmath267 , which corresponds to @xmath268 , and crossing this curve goes from one sheet to the other . in the next section",
    ", we shall describe geodesics which cross sheets in this way .    finally",
    ", we remark on the large-@xmath15 behaviour of the metric . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that when @xmath17 , _ ie . _   when the monopoles are large compared to the @xmath6-period , the only relevant modulus is @xmath33 ; and the metric on the @xmath33-plane was computed by using an approximation to the monopole fields which is valid in this limit .",
    "in fact , we can also compute this limiting metric in the nahm - transformed picture .",
    "the crucial observation is that in the large-@xmath15 regime , the fields are well approximated by the singular solution ( [ singularsoln ] ) , except at its singularities .",
    "in other words , the large-@xmath59 and large-@xmath15 approximations are the same .",
    "it follows that the large-@xmath15 metric on each component of @xmath196 is @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is defined in ( [ i ] ) . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we only used @xmath270 for @xmath59 large , but in this context we need it for all @xmath224 .",
    "the integral ( [ i ] ) converges for all @xmath33 except the two special values @xmath50 , and its value is plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] , as a function of @xmath224 .",

    "the peaks are at @xmath50.,width=377 ]    picture should be compared with the plots of @xmath271 in figure  [ fig1 ] for @xmath242 and @xmath243 : the function @xmath270 appears to be the @xmath272 limit of @xmath271 .",
    "a more extensive numerical investigation of @xmath244 , for a wider range of @xmath15 , bears this out .",
    "note also that in this limit , the surface @xmath260 resembles two copies of figure  [ fig2 ] , branched between the singularities .",
    "our aim in this section is to identify geodesics on @xmath273 and @xmath260 , and to interpret these in terms of 2-monopole trajectories",
    ". one could construct such geodesics numerically , for example by using the numerically - derived metrics on these surfaces ; such a construction was implemented in @xcite in the large-@xmath15 limit .",
    "but here we will do something more analytic , namely identifying geodesics on @xmath273 and @xmath260 as fixed - point sets of additional symmetries of the system .",
    "an example of this type was presented in @xcite ; we will here give a fuller discussion , revealing rather more interesting behaviour than was seen before .",
    "the first step is to describe the relevant symmetries of the hitchin equations ( [ hit ] ) .",
    "there are two of them , namely @xmath274 @xmath275 the fixed - point sets of ( [ sym1 ] ) and ( [ sym2 ] ) are geodesic hypersurfaces in @xmath2 given by @xmath276 and @xmath277 respectively , and the intersections of these with the surfaces @xmath273 and @xmath260 are geodesics . for @xmath273 , this leads to a picture which is essentially the same as in the @xmath4 case : the geodesics pass over the `` centre '' of the deformed cone , and this corresponds to @xmath278 planar scattering of two monopoles , via a toroidal 2-monopole solution .",
    "the geodesics on the double - trumpet @xmath260 are more interesting , however , and we shall focus on them in what follows .    in terms of the coordinate @xmath262 on @xmath260 , the symmetries ( [ sym1 ] , [ sym2 ] ) lead to five complete geodesics , namely the four half - axes in the @xmath263-plane and the unit circle @xmath268 .",
    "the last of these is a closed geodesic which winds around the waist of the double - trumpet .",
    "the two points @xmath279 on it are the two special solutions ( [ specialpoints ] ) representing 1-monopole fields taken over two periods , the monopoles being located on the @xmath6-axis at @xmath280 .     on @xmath281 , for four points on the geodesic @xmath268 . ]    in fact , the geodesic consists entirely of monopole pairs located at these two points on the @xmath6-axis : the monopoles stay in the same position and simply oscillate in shape .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] , which was generated by numerical solution of the hitchin equations ( [ hweqns ] ) for a range of @xmath263-values , followed by numerical implementation of the inverse nahm transform .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 was taken to have the value @xmath242 .",
    "each of the plots in figure  [ fig3 ] is a contour plot of @xmath282 on the plane @xmath281 , with the higgs field @xmath9 having a zero at the centre @xmath283 .",
    "the cases @xmath284 correspond to @xmath285 on each of the two @xmath33-sheets , and one then has an additional @xmath286 symmetry which is absent for the other points on this bounded trajectory .",
    "the pictures on the plane @xmath287 are the same .",
    "so we have a periodic trajectory representing a string of equally - spaced monopoles , with all their kinetic energy coming from their in - phase shape oscillation .",
    "the other four geodesics mentioned above are of scattering type , where two widely - separated monopoles undergo a head - on collision and then separate again .",
    "let us first describe the @xmath288 case , _ ie .",
    "_  @xmath263 on the positive real axis .",
    "a point with @xmath289 corresponds to a pair of monopoles widely - separated on the @xmath290-axis , in fact at @xmath291 , @xmath292 . at the other end of the geodesic , where @xmath293 , we have monopoles at @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 . in other words ,",
    "the monopoles approach each other along the @xmath290-axis , collide , and emerge along the @xmath297 directions but shifted by half a period in @xmath6 . using a numerical nahm transform for a sequence of real @xmath263-values near",
    "@xmath298 reveals what happens to the monopoles as they collide : the results of this are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .     on @xmath294 , for five points on the geodesic @xmath288 . ]    in effect , the scattering takes place in the plane @xmath294 , and so we use contour plots in this plane . note that the range of @xmath6 in the plots has been shifted , using the periodicity , in order to give a clearer representation of the scattering .",
    "as @xmath263 increases from a small positive value , the monopoles come in along the @xmath290-axis , with @xmath299 . by @xmath300 ( the first plot in figure  [ fig4 ] )",
    "we see that they have merged at the origin",
    ". then ( second plot , with @xmath301 ) they begin to separate along the @xmath6-axis . at @xmath298 , they are equidistant : this is a special solution ( [ specialpoints ] ) .",
    "then they re - merge at @xmath296 on the @xmath6-axis , and separate in the @xmath297-directions .",
    "the combination of @xmath302 scattering in the @xmath303-plane and periodicity in @xmath6 leads , in this example , to a picture in which monopoles emerge in the same directions as they entered , but shifted by half a period .",
    "the plots in figure  [ fig4 ] are for @xmath242 ; for other values of @xmath15 , the picture is qualitatively the same , although the details differ  for example , the value of @xmath263 at which the monopoles merge .",
    "let us consider , next , the geodesic @xmath304 with @xmath305 , _ ie .",
    "_  @xmath263 on the positive imaginary axis .",
    "if @xmath306 , then @xmath307 and the monopoles are located at @xmath308 , @xmath296 ; while if @xmath309 , then @xmath310 and the monopoles are located at @xmath311 , @xmath299 .",
    "so here the trajectory is fully 3-dimensional : the monopoles undergo right - angle scattering in the @xmath312-direction , as well as being shifted by half a period in @xmath6 .",
    "as long as @xmath15 is not too large , any radial line in the @xmath263-plane is an approximate geodesic representing head - on scattering of two monopoles , and it is easy to see that we get a picture which interpolates between the two examples above .",
    "in fact , the line @xmath313 , with @xmath184 fixed , gives a scattering angle of @xmath184 , in addition to the @xmath6-shift .",
    "for large @xmath15 , however , one gets rather different trajectories : see , for example , figure  6 of @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the periodic monopole system admits dynamical behaviour not seen in the non - periodic @xmath4 case , in particular head - on collision of two monopoles resulting in scattering through any angle , accompanied by a half - period shift .",
    "this is a consequence both of the periodicity , and of the absence of rotational symmetry about the periodic axis .",
    "it would be worth studying other geodesics on the double - trumpet geodesic surface , not just those representing head - on collisions , as this might reveal further novel behaviour .",
    "we have shown that the asymptotic metric on the 2-monopole moduli space may be computed directly via a simple approximation of the relevant nahm / hitchin data ; and this metric agrees , as expected , with that derived by considering the effective 2-monopole lagrangian .",
    "this asymptotic metric is relatively simple , having continuous symmetries ; in particular , one can identify geodesic surfaces which are different from those described in this paper , and which do not involve @xmath62 and @xmath84 remaining constant",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the global structure of these , and to look for geodesics ( trajectories ) where @xmath62 and/or @xmath84 change .",
    "the methods used here should extend to the case of higher charge monopoles . in the @xmath4 case ,",
    "it is particularly useful to consider multi - monopoles invariant under discrete subgroups of the rotation group @xcite . because of the lack of rotational symmetry in the periodic case",
    ", it seems unlikely that the full scope of this technique could be applied .",
    "but certain discrete symmetries such as cyclic symmetry should remain relevant , and it would be worth making a systematic study of the symmetries of the su(@xmath36 ) hitchin system , corresponding to centred periodic @xmath36-monopole solutions , for higher values of @xmath36 . some preliminary results along these lines have been obtained , and further work is in progress .",
