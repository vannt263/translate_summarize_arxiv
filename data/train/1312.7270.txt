    "<S> neutrino flavour oscillations in a nonuniformly moving matter are considered . the neutrino oscillation resonance condition in presence of matter , in the most general case when matter is moving with acceleration , </S>",
    "<S> is derived for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the effect of matter acceleration can have significant influence on neutrino oscillations pattern in different astrophysical environments .    </S>",
    "<S> in this short note we generalize our previous studies @xcite on neutrino flavour oscillations in an uniformly moving matter to the case when matter moves with acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> consider two flavour ( electron and muon ) neutrino oscillations in nonuniformly moving matter . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian of neutrino interactions with background matter can be expressed in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi constant , @xmath2 is the speed of matter , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the electron and muon neutrino correspondingly . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is the electron number density in the reference frame for which the total speed of matter is zero . </S>",
    "<S> note that we consider the matter composed of neutrons , protons and electrons . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , neutrons and protons do not influence the oscillations .    for the effective hamiltonian of neutrino flavour states evolution </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath10 is the neutrino energy and @xmath11 is the angle between the speed of matter and the direction of neutrino propagation ( it is supposed that the neutrino is propagating along @xmath12 direction ) . in the adiabatic approximation </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation probability has the usual form @xmath13 , where the effective mixing angle @xmath14 and oscillation length @xmath15 are determined by the elements @xmath16 of the evolution hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the straightforward calculations yields the neutrino flavour oscillations resonance condition  @xcite @xmath17 in the considered case the neutrino oscillations probability gets its maximum value in a set of points @xmath18 that are the solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ res_cond ] ) . note that in general case eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ res_cond ] ) is not linear in respect to @xmath12 . obviously , that in case of monotonic @xmath12 dependence of the density @xmath19 there can be only one resonance point </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> consider matter motion with a constant acceleration @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> then the matter velocity is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial matter speed . </S>",
    "<S> in this case one can obtain the effective electron matter density in the form @xmath23    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] the function @xmath24 is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath19 significantly increases in case of matter motion against neutrino propagation ( @xmath25 ) and almost vanishes in the opposite case ( @xmath26 ) . in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits of matter motion eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ne_v ] ) can be simplified as follows @xmath27 in the corresponding evaluation it is supposed that @xmath28 . when nonrelativistic matter is moving with a constant acceleration the corresponding shift of the electron number density </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , during a supernova core - collapse @xmath32 is up to 0,2 that yields an order of @xmath33 shift to the effective resonance number density @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to consider possibilities of observing this effect .     and the angle of propagation @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the red arrows defines the direction of a neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right plots corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath34 accordingly.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and the angle of propagation @xmath11 . </S>",
