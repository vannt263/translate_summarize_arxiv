    "phase separating binary fluids form complex patterns of domains at late times after a temperature quench into an unstable state .",
    "the morphology of the domains is determined by factors such as the volume fractions of the two phases , the viscosities of the two phases , and any externally applied forces @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us is the effect of applying an external shear flow to a phase separating binary fluid .",
    "this question is of technological importance because many industrial processes involve binary mixtures in a flow field .",
    "the final material properties depend on the domain morphology , which can be strongly affected by the fluid flow .    at late times after a temperature quench into the two phase region of the phase diagram , a phase separating fluid consists of domains of the two phases of typical size @xmath0 , which coarsen with time generally as a power law @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a shear flow dramatically alters the kinetics of the phase separation .",
    "the shear flow deforms the domains , interfering with their growth so that it competes with the thermodynamic force driving the phase separation .",
    "many theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have investigated the effect of the shear flow on the growth of the domains and the exponent @xmath2 . in this work",
    "we focus on a different aspect of the effect of shear : eventually the binary fluid tends towards a dynamic , nonequilibrium steady state in which the coarsening instability is stopped by the shear flow @xcite .",
    "the morphology in this stationary state is very anisotropic @xcite . in relatively weak shear ,",
    "the domains are somewhat deformed , whereas at higher shear they can become highly elongated along the flow direction .",
    "a `` string phase '' consisting of macroscopically long cylindrical domains forms when the two phases are both percolated @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , since a long cylinder of fluid at rest would normally break up via the rayleigh instability @xcite , a hydrodynamic instability .",
    "the string phase appears to be a fairly robust phenomenon , appearing in both critical and off - critical polymer mixtures @xcite and in critical micellar solutions @xcite .",
    "thus , the shear flow both opposes the thermodynamic instability driving phase separation and stabilizes these highly anisotropic domains against hydrodynamic instabilities .    our goal is to understand these stabilizing effects of shear flow . as a first step towards elucidating these effects , we consider a strictly two dimensional system .",
    "we expect the operative physical mechanisms in the two dimensional fluid to be somewhat different than those in the three dimensional case , but the mathematical techniques and physical insights developed here will be of use in the future for three dimensional calculations .",
    "we consider late times after an initial temperature quench into the unstable region of the phase diagram , when the system is composed of domains of the two phases close to their equilibrium concentrations and separated by well - defined interfaces .",
    "we will , however , retain the dynamics of the concentration field in our analysis , so that the interfaces between domains have a finite width @xmath3 .",
    "we model the fluid using the coupled cahn - hilliard and navier - stokes ( for creeping flow ) equations as described in section [ eqtns ] .",

    "in section [ method ] we linearize our equations for the general case of a system with any number of flat interfaces , and develop some useful mathematical machinery . in section [ 1int ] we apply our methods to the case of a single interface , and reproduce some well - known results . in section [ lamella ]",

    "we impose a shear flow along the @xmath4-direction by applying a constant shear stress @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we take the viscosity of the two phases to be equal , so that the flow field of the unperturbed system is linear .",
    "there are two linearly independent perturbations of the lamellar domain along the x - axis . in the `` zig - zag '' mode the two interfaces fluctuate in phase , whereas in the `` varicose '' or `` peristaltic '' mode they fluctuate out of phase .",
    "we find that in the absence of the shear flow the zig - zag mode is stable , whereas the varicose mode is unstable to long wavelength perturbations .",
    "we use a tight - binding approximation to include the effect of the shear flow . in section [ results ]",
    "we observe that the shear flow mixes the two modes so that above a critical shear rate @xmath6 the lamellar domain is stable .",

    "the equation for the velocity is the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible fluid , generalized to include the coupling of the order parameter to the velocity field @xcite : @xmath15 in this paper the viscosity @xmath16 will be taken to be independent of @xmath7 ; hence there is a single viscosity for the fluid independent of the concentration pattern .",

    "we impose a constant shear stress @xmath5 so the stationary velocity satisfies @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the shear rate .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite our equations in dimensionless form by scaling lengths by the correlation length , the concentration by its equilibrium magnitude in the bulk phases , and time by the natural diffusion time involving the mobility @xmath14 in the cahn - hilliard equation .",

    "note that this is _ not _ the rayleigh instability of a long fluid cylinder , in which the cylinder is unstable towards long wavelength , axisymmetric fluctuations .",
    "that is a hydrodynamic instability that occurs for a three - dimensional cylindrical interface because the curvature at the necks is higher than at the bulges . in this two - dimensional perturbation mode ,",
    "the curvature at the necks and bulges is of the same magnitude ( the extra dimension out of the plane of say fig .",
    "[ pinchfig ] does not exist ) , and so there is no curvature - driven instability .",
    "the curvature effect is stabilizing , and it is the thermodynamic force driving phase separation that causes the instability .    2      next we consider what happens when we include the external shear flow .",
    "physically , the shear flow tends to mix the two modes since the top interface travels in an opposite direction to the bottom interface .",
    "we might then expect that at some shear rate , the two perturbation modes lose their distinguishing features .",
    "to calculate the eigenvalues we only need to calculate the matrix elements involving the shear .",

    "we see that at low shear rates the unstable mode still exists , but the window of wavenumbers over which @xmath215 becomes smaller as @xmath216 increases . above some critical shear rate @xmath6 ,",
    "the previously unstable mode becomes stable for all @xmath51 .",
    "the shear flow thus completely stabilizes the varicose mode , by mixing it with the stable zig - zag mode .    2    we can easily solve for the critical shear rate @xmath6 . first note that the first term in ( [ disp ] ) is positive , because the negative terms in @xmath217 are exponentially small in @xmath131 .",
    "as @xmath216 is increased , the square root term in ( [ disp ] ) becomes smaller .",
    "the effect is that the value of @xmath51 below which @xmath218 becomes smaller with increasing shear ; the domain is only unstable to longer and longer wavelength perturbations as the shear rate is increased . for a given shear rate , @xmath219 for all @xmath220 where @xmath221 satisfies @xmath222 : @xmath223 the unstable mode becomes stable for all wavenumbers @xmath51 when @xmath224 . to find the critical shear rate , we first solve ( [ crit ] ) for @xmath225 : @xmath226 taking the limit @xmath227 in eq .",

    "we can also invert ( [ gammac ] ) to obtain the critical width @xmath232 above which the lamella is stable for a given shear rate @xmath216 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ gammacl ] , given a shear rate @xmath216 , at values of @xmath131 lying below the curve the lamella is unstable to the varicose coarsening mode whereas for values of @xmath131 above the curve the lamella is stable and will no longer coarsen .",
    "this simple system of a single lamellar domain thus exhibits the well - known experimental observation that the shear flow tends to halt the phase separation process .",
    "= 4 in    = 4 in    2",
    "we have seen that in the case of an isolated lamellar domain , shear flow has the effect of mixing the zig - zag and varicose modes so that they both become stable .",
    "essentially , the flow eliminates the special phase relationship between the two interfaces necessary for the varicose mode to exist .",
    "the physics of this mode is that thin regions evaporate in favor of thick regions , but in the presence of shear thin and thick regions do not exist long enough for this diffusion to take place since the fluctuations are being carried downstream .",
    "we would expect that a similar mechanism would apply to a large stack ( along the @xmath21-direction ) of lamellar domains .",
    "although the stability eigenvalues have not been calculated for this case , the effects seen in the single lamellar domain should apply .",
    "coarsening in the @xmath21 direction in a stack of lamellae is also dependent on thinner regions evaporating , their atoms diffusing across the intervening phase to a thicker region .",
    "from @xcite we expect this coarsening instability to also have a rate that is exponentially small in @xmath131 .",
    "when one considers sinusoidal perturbations of the layers in a shear flow , once again the phase relations between interfaces will be constantly changing .",
    "as @xmath131 increases , the atoms must diffuse farther across a layer for the pattern to coarsen , but they must be able to do so before they are swept downstream by the shear flow to a new @xmath4 position where the diffusion is no longer favored .",
    "we might anticipate then that in a general two - dimensional system with many lamellar domains , for any given shear rate @xmath216 there is an upper limit @xmath232 to the layer spacing for which the coarsening instability is still present .",
    "the shear flow destroys the correlations between interfaces necessary for the coarsening instability to operate , leading to a dynamic steady state .",
    "the strength of the shear flow would determine the typical lamellar width @xmath233 present in the system at steady state .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to that seen in the fully three dimensional `` string '' phase in shear flow .",
    "we do not expect quantitative agreement , however , because the stability analysis of the lamellar domain considered here is strongly dependent on the dimensionality .",
    "the instability of a long cylinder is much stronger than the weak exponential ( 2d ) instability found here . for the case of a viscous cylinder of fluid immersed in another viscous liquid",
    ", the hydrodynamic instability corresponding to a varicose perturbation has a dispersion relation that behaves as @xcite @xmath234 where @xmath151 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "thus , we might expect more dramatic effects in this case .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that a long extended domain in the two - phase state of a two - dimensional , phase - separating binary fluid can be stabilized by an applied shear flow .",
    "there is a critical shear rate below which the extended domain is unstable towards long wavelength fluctuations and above which we predict complete stabilization .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with experiments on dynamic steady states in phase - separating fluids under shear flow , however the mechanisms operative here are different due to the reduced dimensionality .",
    "we intend to report results of a similar calculation for a long cylindrical domain under flow in the future .",
