    "a scalar field is mathematically equivalent to a fluid with a time - dependent speed of sound ( ratra 1991 ) , and with @xmath11 , @xmath10 , the @xmath6 energy density behaves like a cosmological constant that decreases with time . in our analysis of this model here",
    "we do not make use of the time - independent equation of state fluid approximation to the model , since this leads to incorrect results ( e.g. , podariu & ratra 2000 ) .",
    "effective fluid realizations of quintessence with a time - dependent equation of state have also been studied . however , since such an equation of state is arbitrary , observational constraints on it are largely determined by how it is modelled .",

    "the chosen fiducial model is spatially - flat with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as expected , the constraint contours are elliptical , indicating that one combination of the parameters is better constrained than the other orthogonal combination .",
    "deep data with neutral case errors will lead to interesting constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "deep data with best case errors will result in tighter constraints than current sn ia data ( compare with fig .",
    "5 of podariu & ratra 2000 ) but will be slightly less constraining than anticipated worst case snap data ( see fig . 3 of pnr ) .",
    "note however that the worst case snap data errors of pnr are the baseline snap mission errors .",
    "nd note that the major axis of the anticipated deep data constraint contours is rotated slightly relative to that of the anticipated snap data contours ( compare fig .",
    "2 here with fig . 3 of pnr ) . if deep data systematic errors ( largely due to evolution ) can be reduced well below the huterer & turner ( 2000 ) estimates , then a combined analysis of anticipated deep and snap data will result in very tight constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "if the deep data systematic errors remain as large as the huterer & turner ( 2000 ) estimates , then this data will be less constraining than snap data and the slight relative rotation of the major axes of the contours will result in deep data only slightly tightening the snap contours .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the ability of anticipated deep data to discriminate between a constant and a time - variable @xmath0 in a spatially - flat model .",

    "again , anticipated deep data with best case errors will result in tight constraints , roughly comparable to what should be achieved by anticipated worst case snap data ( see fig .",
    "5 of pnr ) .",
    "if other data ( e.g. , cosmic microwave background anisotropy , or weak - lensing , or sn ia apparent magnitude measurements ) pinned down some of the cosmological parameters , deep data would then provide tighter constraints on the remaining parameters .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "5 shows constraints from anticipated deep data on @xmath1 in a spatially - flat constant @xmath0 model and in an open @xmath37 model .",
    "deep data will provide fairly restrictive constraints on @xmath1 in both cases .",
    "for instance , at 3 @xmath2 , in the spatially - flat model ( with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) we find @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for neutral , worst , and best case errors , while in the open model ( with @xmath28 and @xmath5 ) we have @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for neutral , worst , and best case errors . as expected from the elliptical shape of the contours in fig .",
    "2 , anticipated deep data will constrain @xmath1 more tightly in the flat case than in the open case .    figure 6 shows deep data constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath34 in the spatially flat time - variable @xmath0 model , if other data were to require that either @xmath36 or @xmath35 ( in a fiducial model with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "anticipated deep data will provide fairly tight constraints on these parameters .",
    "for example , if @xmath44 we find @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for neutral , worst , and best case errors , while if @xmath35 we have @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for neutral ,",
    "worst ( here the upper limit lies outside the parameter range considered ) , and best case errors , all at 3 @xmath2 .",
    "galaxy number counts versus redshift data of the quality assumed here will lead to fairly tight constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , in a spatially - flat constant @xmath0 model where all other parameters are known , anticipated deep data will determine @xmath1 to about @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( for neutral , worst , and best case errors respectively ) at 1 @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding errors on @xmath1 for the open case are about @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . for the time - variable @xmath0 model ,",
    "when @xmath34 is fixed , @xmath1 will be known to about @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively , while when @xmath1 is fixed , @xmath34 will be determined to about @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . in agreement with",
