    "equations of the form ( [ i1 ] ) appear naturally in many real - world applications after a separation of variables and therefore have received considerable attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",

    "represents a so - called neumann series of bessel functions ( see @xcite , @xcite and a recent publication on the subject @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we prove that the series ( [ i2 ] ) converges uniformly with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , the very convenient estimates and are obtained which guarantee that a partial sum from ( [ i2 ] ) approximates equally well the solution @xmath9 both for small and for large values of the spectral parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we illustrate this feature of ( [ i2 ] ) with several numerical examples which show that this new representation besides other possible applications can be used as a simple and powerful numerical method for solving boundary value and spectral problems related to ( [ i1 ] ) .    in the recent work @xcite an analogous representation of solutions",
    "was obtained for the regular one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath17 .",
    "however following similar lines does not lead to the result in the case of the perturbed bessel equation .",
    "several new ideas are necessary .",
    "we make use of the properties of a couple of transmutation operators , one of them relating the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the other relating the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( studied in @xcite , @xcite ) . the first of these transmutations is used for separating the part corresponding to the unperturbed equation ( @xmath21 ) and the second to add the perturbation .",
    "we specify that neither here nor in the title of the paper the perturbation means any kind of smallness of the coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "the use of two transmutation operators allows us to show that the regular solution of ( [ i1 ] ) can be represented in the form @xmath22 where the kernel @xmath23 is a sufficiently good function which admits a convergent fourier - legendre series expansion .",
    "moreover , this approach makes it possible to write down the result of the integral @xmath24 for any @xmath25 and as a consequence to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficients of the fourier - legendre series .",
    "substitution of the series into ( [ intro ul ] ) leads to the main result ( [ i2 ] ) .",

    "we implement a different approach based on the asymptotic formulas from @xcite and @xcite , a paley - wiener theorem and the constructive approximation theory @xcite . as a result , we present close to optimal convergence rate estimates depending on the parameter @xmath3 and the smoothness of the potential @xmath5 .",
    "analogous formulas are developed for the derivative of the regular solution .",
    "the direct explicit formula for the coefficient @xmath15 is not however the most convenient for numerical computation .",
    "this is due to the fact that it involves coefficients of the legendre polynomial of order @xmath27 which grow rapidly when @xmath28 grows and hence , although the coefficients @xmath15 decrease , one needs to compute linear combinations of large numbers .",
    "this reduces considerably the number of the coefficients which can be computed in machine precision .",
    "fortunately , there exists another way to compute the coefficients @xmath15 with the aid of a recurrent integration procedure similar to that arising in the spps method @xcite , @xcite and much more stable in practice . to develop the procedure we find the sequence of differential equations satisfied by the coefficients @xmath15",
    "this is done by substitution of ( [ i2 ] ) into ( [ i1 ] ) .    in the last part of the paper",
    "we show that ( [ i2 ] ) offers a simple and powerful numerical method for computing regular solutions of ( [ i1 ] ) and for solving spectral problems related .",
