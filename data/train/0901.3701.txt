    "they showed that the goursat problem for system admits a global solution in the self - similar plane , which is smooth with a possible vacuum near the origin ( see figure 1 , where @xmath9 ) .",
    "_ we are interested in the size of the vacuum boundary @xmath10 where the pressure gradient system is degenerate .",
    "_ somewhat surprisingly , our result shows that the vacuum bubble is trivial and the entire vacuum boundary is the trivial coordinate axes in the self - similar plane ( see figure 2 , where @xmath9 ) , which is stated in our main theorem at the end of section 3 .",
    "further motivation for the study of the current problem is that the study of boundaries such as a sonic curve is important in establishing the global existence of a solution to a general two dimensional riemann problem of the pressure gradient system .",
    "in addition , the solution of the current problem covers wave interaction problems in which only some fractions of the plane waves are involved .",
    "wave interactions of these kinds are common in two dimensional riemann problems . finally , the study of the pressure gradient system has motivated work on two dimensional full euler systems , see li @xcite and zheng @xcite .",

    "see figure 3 .",
    "the characteristic form of the pressure gradient equation enjoys a number of useful properties .",
    "for example , the quantities @xmath20 keep their positivities / negativities along characteristics of a plus / minus family , and the sign - persevering quantities yield monotonicity of the primary variable @xmath21 ( see @xcite , also @xcite where the authors propose to call them _ riemann sign - persevering variables _ ) , and the fact that a state adjacent to a constant state for the pressure gradient system must be a simple wave in which @xmath21 is constant along the characteristics of a plus / minus family @xcite .",
    "the characteristic decomposition has played an important role and was a powerful tool for building the existence of smooth solutions in the work of dai and zhang @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the size of the vacuum boundary @xmath22 where the pressure gradient equation is degenerate . for this purpose , we rewrite as @xmath23 \\partial_-\\partial_+p = q\\partial_+p\\partial_-p    - q(\\partial_+p)^2 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 define the characteristic curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 r_-^a(\\theta_a ) = 2\\sin\\theta_a , \\end{cases } { \\rm and}\\quad \\begin{cases } \\frac{dr_+^b(\\theta)}{d\\theta } = \\frac{1}{\\lambda    \\big(r_+^b(\\theta ) , \\theta\\big)},\\\\[3 mm ] r_+^b(\\theta_b ) = 2\\cos\\theta_b",

    "in this section , we use the iterative formulas and to prove that the vacuum bubble @xmath46 is in fact the trivial origin @xmath47 in the self - similar plane . we use the method of contradiction . assume to the contrary that there is a bubble with boundary @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for some @xmath49 .",
    "that means @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and the solution is smooth in the domain bounded by the bubble @xmath53 and the upper and lower characteristic boundaries .",
    "we intend to deduce contradictions , which in turn proves that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 and the vacuum bubble @xmath56 is in fact the trivial origin @xmath47 in the self - similar plane .    before we start the above procedure , we point out two observations which roughly imply the nonexistence of the vacuum bubble . for presenting the observations , we assume further that @xmath57 for all @xmath52 .",
    "first , we can compute easily the characteristic slope @xmath58 along the upper characteristic boundary and consider @xmath59 .",
    "similar result holds on the lower boundary . now assuming there is a bubble , noting that along the plus characteristics , by definition of @xmath60 in , we see easily that @xmath61 as @xmath62 ( near the vacuum bubble ) except for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the above computation reveals that there is some kind of inconsistency for the slopes of the characteristics at @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the polar coordinate plane .",
    "next , let us calculate the decay rate of @xmath21 along the middle line @xmath65 . by using the symmetry of system ( see figure 3 ) , we can obtain that @xmath66 asymptotically . to show the details , we propose @xmath67 as @xmath68 tends to a point of the vacuum bubble .",
    "then , by , we have @xmath69 which implies that @xmath70 should be @xmath71 .",
    "thus , by using , we have @xmath72 asymptotically as @xmath68 tends to a point of the vacuum bubble . therefore ,",
    "@xmath73 asymptotically as @xmath68 tends to a point of the vacuum bubble on the line @xmath74 , which implies that there is no interior vacuum at least at @xmath75 .",
    "we point out incidentally that zheng s previous numerical computation of the bubble , referred to in dai and zhang @xcite , is probably caused by the fast exponential decay .        in what follows ,",
    "we concentrate on establishing the above formal intuition rigorously . with the symmetry of system ,",
    "let us restrict our arguments on @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "fix a point @xmath77 on the bubble boundary .",
    "let us denote @xmath78 the bounded domain determined by the positive and negative characteristic curves starting from @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "we point out that sometimes we still denote the characteristics passing through @xmath88 or any other point @xmath68 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 or @xmath28 and @xmath29 , when in fact @xmath89 is dependent on @xmath90 , etc .",

    "namely , there hold @xmath104 note that the positive constant @xmath105 is independent of @xmath106 , but depends on the fixed @xmath77 .",
    "we start to prove .",
    "suppose that is correct up to a line segment @xmath107 , then we improve to strict inequalities on the line segment @xmath82 in the same domain .",
