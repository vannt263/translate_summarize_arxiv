    "decoherence is one of the main obstacles in building quantum computing architecture , which yields both operational errors and loss of coherence and entanglement . to defeat decoherence ,",
    "people have so far proposed a number of ideas , for example in @xcite , where the error avoiding strategies carried out in decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) , compared with other error correction schemes , are relatively simpler , because they only require some special encodings immune from certain system - environment disturbances and no error correction steps are needed .    the present work is focused on a dephasing - free scheme for universal quantum computation with free electrons .",
    "free electrons have recently been shown to be available for constructing universal quantum computation @xcite , in which the basic idea is the quantum information encoded in electron spins and the quantum gating assisted by electronic charge detection . due to independence between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of the electrons , we may design a quantum computing architecture with free electrons like the idea used in linear optical quantum computation @xcite .",
    "for example , like photons , electrons could be employed to carry out cluster - state preparation and multipartite analyzer @xcite , and to do entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "but actually , there are some intrinsic differences between electrons and photons",
    ". the photons do not interact directly with each other , but electrons repel due to coulomb interaction .",
    "so the works @xcite are based on a screening model in which interaction - free assumption is applicable to free electrons . besides , different polarized states are degenerate to photons , which excludes any possibility of dephasing due to different states in evolution . while an electronic level would be split in a magnetic field due to zeeman interaction . as a result",
    ", dephasing is an important detrimental factor in application of free electrons for quantum computation .    to remove dephasing effects , we used to employ refocusing techniques , which reverse the time evolution during some elaborately selected periods , and counteract the influence from dephasing .",
    "however , refocusing operation does not work for magnetic field fluctuation , which happens unpredictably in experiments . to reduce dephasing",
    ", we must work in dfs . _",
    "the motivation of this paper is to design a dfs scheme for free - electron model so that the free electrons , in addition to above mentioned screening  assumption , could be fully modeled as free photons for quantum computation .",
    "_ we define the encoding to be @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which constitutes a well - known dfs scheme immune from dephasing induced by the system - environment interaction in the form of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and b is a random bath operator .",
    "we will assume throughout our scheme that the collective dephasing is dominant for the electron pairs because the collective errors due to coupling to environment are generally considered to be the main problem for solid - state systems at low temperature and dephasing is dominant in the corresponding class of quantum computing devices .",
    "while for other dephasing effects , we may overcome them with the same dfs encoding by some additional dynamical decoupling ( e.g. , bang - bang ) pulses @xcite .",
    "to avoid confusion , we call @xmath4 and @xmath5 logic - qubits , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 physical - qubits with 0 ( 1 ) representing spin up ( down ) . the four bell states in our scheme are thereby expressed as @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "since the logic - qubits are immune from collective dephasing , the dephasing errors would be considerably suppressed in implementation of our designed quantum computation .",
    "we now address in detail how to realize a universal quantum computation in the dfs by building blocks involving polarizing beam splitters , charge detectors , and single - spin rotations .",
    "the basic components for a universal quantum computation are two noncommutable single - qubit operations and a nontrivial two - qubit gate . for an arbitrary logic - qubit state , e.g. , @xmath11 , a single - logic - qubit rotation @xmath12",
    "can be realized by rotating one of the physical - qubits , as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) : if we consider a rotation of the first physical - qubit , as the potential barrier in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) makes @xmath13 be @xmath14 but @xmath6 unchanged , we have @xmath15 @xmath16 where the phase @xmath17 is determined by the characteristic of the potential barrier@xmath18 besides its own function in universal quantum computation , this rotation gate @xmath12 will be also used below for achieving other gates .",
    "another important single - logic - qubit gate is hadamard gate , i.e. , @xmath19/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] with @xmath20 and @xmath21 arbitrary numbers , and @xmath22 to do this job in dfs , we have to introduce  ancillary physical - qubits @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are initially prepared in @xmath25 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , the initial state @xmath26 can be made in the case of p@xmath27=0 , where p@xmath27 is a charge parity measurement building block designed in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "p@xmath27 functions as : p=1 means the two input spins aligned , and p=0 corresponds to the opposite spins input .",
    "so we have the initial state of the system as@xmath28 /\\sqrt{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  besides the ancillary qubits , a controlled - phase operation between physical - qubits 1 and @xmath23 is necessary in constructing our hadamard gate for logic - qubits , which is shown in appendix and also in fig .",
    "after this controlled - phase gate is applied , we have@xmath29   /\\sqrt{2}.\\ ] ] then if we find in fig .",
    "2 that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which implies that input physical - qubits are in a state @xmath32 @xcite@xmath33 then the qubit pair @xmath34-@xmath24 collapses to @xmath35 which is exactly a hadamard gate for logic - qubits in dfs but with the quantum information transferred from pair 1 - 2 to pair 1@xmath36- 2@xmath36 .",
    "this trick has also been used previously for neutral atoms in dfs @xcite .",
    "we may have an alternative for the last step , that is , in the case of @xmath37 and @xmath38 the qubit pair @xmath23-@xmath24 collapses to@xmath39 for this situation , we may also have our desired hadamard gate after additional spin - flip @xmath40 operations are applied on physical - qubits 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "therefore we have achieved a logic - qubit hadamard gate deterministically by four physical - qubits with quantum information transferred from the pair 1 - 2 to the pair 1@xmath36 - 2@xmath36 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43    to accomplish a universal quantum computation , however , we also need a nontrivial two - logic - qubit gate .",
    "3 demonstrates a controlled - phase gate for two logic - qubits consisting of pairs 1 - 2 and 5 - 6 , assisted by an ancillary pair 3 - 4 which are measured at the end of the circuit .",
    "so the total system is initially prepared in@xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 c and d are arbitrary numbers with @xmath47 and @xmath48 after we have the charge detection at @xmath49 with @xmath501 , the system becomes@xmath51 where the first four qubits are entangled as a bell state of the logic - qubits when @xmath52 .",
    "please note that , if @xmath53 the system are still in the dfs , i.e.,@xmath54 from which we may also achieve eq .",
    "( 4 ) by additional spin - flip operations @xmath40 on physical - qubits 3 and 4 . following the operation steps in fig .",
    "3 , we have to twice use the hadamard gate designed in fig . 2 , and go through a block p@xmath55 in the case of p@xmath56",
    "we obtain the output of the system,@xmath57 so we measure the physical - qubits 3 and 4 .",
    "the output @xmath58 means a two - logic - qubit controlled phase gate to be achieved .",
    "alternatively , if we have @xmath59 , the controlled phase gate is also available after an additional operation @xmath60 is applied on the pair 5 - 6 .",
    "moreover , if we find p@xmath61 the output should be in the state,@xmath62 like previously , if the measurement on physical - qubits 3 and 4 yields @xmath63 ( @xmath59 ) , we may achieve the two - logic - qubit controlled phase gate after applying operation @xmath64 on physical - qubits 1 ( 1 and 5 ) .",
    "it was considered that quantum computation using free electrons is more powerful than using photons because the former is a deterministic one and thus needs less ancillary qubits @xcite . moreover , as the charge detection is non - destructive with respect to the qubits encoded in electron spins , there is no loss of qubits in the detection . as a result , we could have deterministic quantum gating by free electrons in the dfs , which is much more efficient than the probabilistic gating by photons .",
    "furthermore , the ideas with photons - the flying qubits - interacting with static qubits ( such as cold atoms or ions ) are referred to as a promising way towards scalable quantum computation . while as the information conversion based on the interaction between photons and matter is generally inefficient , this kind of quantum computation , even in principle scalable , is of very low success rate .",
    "in contrast , the free electrons , for example , conduction electrons in solid - state materials , could play roles as both flying and static qubits , which would be a promising candidate for large - scale quantum computation @xcite .",
    "although the encoding with electron pairs by our scheme makes more than half numbers of qubits sacrificed , which increases overhead for quantum computation , the operation carried out in dfs much reduces the implementational time and difficulty , and enhances the fidelity .",
    "as seen in current experiments , refocusing pulses to remove dephasing have to be applied repeatedly even for a single quantum gating . in this sense ,",
    "the sacrifice of qubit resource in our scheme helps saving time and laser pulses , and thereby increases the fidelity of implementation . in other words , with the encoding , we could treat free electrons with the same way as photons for a universal quantum computation . as our scheme could be done in a deterministic way , which is the prerequisite for a scalable quantum computation , the quantum computation with free electrons by our scheme could be more advantageous over the probabilistic ways by photons .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "our focus is on the collective dephasing , which is supposed to be a dominant error due to magnetic field fluctuation and could be perfectly eliminated by our encoding . while there are also other errors beyond the collective dephasing one in a real quantum computation , such as logic errors regarding @xmath65 with r = x , y , z , and the leakage errors related to following undesired operations : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73@xcite . to eliminate the logic errors",
    ", we may employ deliberately designed pulse sequences including @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . as this implementation might be not fast enough , however",
    ", the bang - bang pulse control would not fully remove the logic errors , which need further amendment by refocusing on individual physical - qubits @xcite .",
    "the leakage errors could be in principle fully removed by the leakage - elimination operator introduced by @xcite .",
    "this operator is actually associated with projection operations which could be applied to our free electron case . moreover , since the errors are brought about by unpredictable factors , e.g. , the fluctuation of the magnetic field , we have to first use interrogative bang - bang pulses to determine the required values for correction , which has been actually a sophisticated technique @xcite",
    ". a very recent experiment @xcite with two - dimensional electron gas made of gaas / algaas heterostructure has successfully extended t@xmath77 from 10 nanosec to 1 micorsec by using the bang - bang pulses .",
    "so , with the encoding plus bang - bang pulses assisted sometimes by individual physical - qubit refocusing ,  all dephasing errors could be strongly suppressed in our free - electron quantum computation @xcite .",
    "besides dephasing , however , there are other sources of decoherence to affect free electrons , e.g. , the decoherence yielding t@xmath78 fortunately , as reported in @xcite , t@xmath79 could be extended from microsec to tens of millisec in systems of two - dimensional electron gas by means of bang - bang pulses .",
    "this spin relaxing time is long enough for us to achieve high - quality quantum information processing .",
    "the beam splitters and charge detectors employed in our scheme have been experimentally achieved by means of the point contacts in a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite . from the experimental values , we may estimate that each beam splitter takes hundreds of nanosec for an electronic parity check @xcite and each hadamard gate also takes hundreds of nanosec @xcite .",
    "moreover , the currently achievable time resolution for charge detection is of the order of @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "so considering all the operations in the gates designed in the present paper , the time we have to take would be of the order of microsec , which is much shorter than the above mentioned t@xmath78 with the advance of techniques , we believe that this time would be further reduced in the near future .",
    "for example , it is expected that the time resolved detection required in charge detector for the ballistic electrons in a semiconductor will be in the @xmath81 range @xcite . compared to previous proposals for electron - spin - based quantum computation , e.g. , the famous one @xcite in which the qubits are encoded in the spin of the single access electron in conduction band of semiconductor quantum dots and the two - qubit gate is carried out by exchange interaction in the interdot tunneling , our scheme is not more stringent in implementation .",
    "particularly , as  t@xmath77 is much longer in our scheme with dfs encoding , we could achieve a quantum computation with higher fidelity than by any previous scheme without the dfs encoding .",
    "furthermore , as our proposal is for free electrons , our idea could be applied to the spin - based quantum computing proposal for the electrons floating on liquid helium @xcite .    on the other hand , since the charge detectors in our scheme function to distinguish the antiparallel states of two electron - spin from  the parallel states , we may consider an alternative way , as reported in @xcite , to convert spin parity into charge information by resonant tunneling between two quantum dots . with this resonant tunneling characteristic , one can determine the parity of two - qubit spins by differentiating the spin states with antiparallel spins from the ones with parallel spins , in which quantum information encoded in the spin qubits is not destroyed .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a potential scheme for universal quantum computation with free electrons in dfs in a deterministic way by using polarizing beam splitters , charge detectors , and single - spin rotations .",
    "two noncommutable single - logic - qubit gates , i.e. , @xmath12 operation and hadamard gate , and a two - logic - qubit  controlled phase gate have been designed and demonstrated . with these building blocks ,",
    "an universal dephasing - free quantum computing architecture can be constructed for free electrons .",
