    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) machine will enter the collision mode at centre - of - mass energy of 10 tev in 2008 and eventually will operate at 14 tev from 2009 onwards gradually improving upon the luminosity .",
    "two general - purpose detectors , cms ( compact muon solenoid ) and atlas ( a toroidal apparatus ) , are ready for the data - taking phase with intense detector commisioning works underway .",
    "the much awaited discoveries at the lhc have to be preceeded by the _ rediscovery _ of the standard model ( sm ) , and early discovery , though possible , will be challenging . on the other hand , from early phase on , _",
    "ie _ , starting from an integrated luminosity of mere 1 pb@xmath0 , various sm processes can be studied ; in particular , heavy quarkonia peaks of @xmath1 and @xmath2 will shine well above background in the low mass range of the invariant mass distribution of dileptons .",
    "electroweak ( ew ) processes of w and z productions , having very large rates combined with clean leptonic decay mode signatures ( @xmath3 ) , are not only the _ first physics _ at the lhc , they will be studied at all luminosities",
    ". these will be the _ standard candles _ for a large variety of lhc measurements .",
    "the w , z physics will enable , as a function of accumulated data , detector and physics - analysis tools commissioning of the experiments , precision determination of electroweak variables as well as measurements in as yet unexplored kinematic regions . these programmes constitute both the confirmation as well as the consistency checks of sm at the highest energies lhc offer .",
    "the breakthrough discoveries at the lhc will be interpreted by critically studying sm processes with experimental accuracy matched by theoretical understanding at the same level .    since the production cross section and dynamics are largely controlled by qcd , events with inclusive jets , photons , dileptons , heavy quarks will be produced copiously at the lhc , as exemplified in table  [ evtrate ] , providing complementary datasets which will eventually probe many aspects of strong and ew interactions with high precision .",
    "the large samples will also be useful for search of rare processes which potentially hint at as yet unknown _",

    "to establish the anticipated discoveries at the lhc , the standard model processes must be well understood .",
    "various aspects of z - boson production and subsequent decays will be utilised by experiments for precision determination of electroweak parameters .",
    "an early , competitive w mass measurement from the lhc is improbable .",
    "some of the di - boson productions are likely to be etsablished during the early phase of the lhc .",
