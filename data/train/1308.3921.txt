    "the student of quantum theory is confronted , at the outset , with a number of enigmatic fundamentals such as wave - particle dualism , superposition of states , wave function collapse , indeterminism , and the substitution of mathematical operators for real - valued observables . upon reflection ,",
    "one also becomes aware that the standard interpretation of the theory points away from an instinctive , objective world - view and toward the somewhat unnatural philosophy of subjectivism . after sufficient exposure",
    ", one may come to accommodate these tenets , but the troubling mysteries remain , nevertheless .",
    "the intent of the theory of discrete extension is to make a small measure of progress against these mysteries .",
    "a body of results has been obtained concerning the development , interpretation , and application of the theory and will be presented in this and subsequent papers .",
    "the principal goals of this initial paper are limited , however , to three .",
    "the first is to introduce the concept of a _ discretely extended object _ and to propose it as a characterization of the nature of quantum - level entities .",
    "such an object will also be referred to here as a _",
    "clustor_. the paper offers this non - classical concept as a unitary alternative to the dual , classical concepts of wave and particle .",
    "the theory of discrete extension embodies this well - defined , unitary concept and thereby avoids the dilemmas of wave - particle dualism and complementarity , and the associated philosophical problem of subjectivism .",
    "the second goal is to develop the mathematical theory of clustor dynamics , to show that the concept of a discretely extended object arises naturally within the theory , and to illustrate examples of clustor dynamics for simple systems .",
    "the paper shows that this dynamical theory is an extension of newtonian mechanics that takes into account the nonzero value of planck s constant , @xmath0 .",
    "the paper proposes that the theory is valid in the microscopic domain .",
    "the third goal is to show that the theory generates correct , quasi - discrete action increments and energy levels for bound - state systems without recourse to the operator formalism and eigenvalue problems of standard quantum theory .",
    "the paper illustrates this capability by applying the theory to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this simple exercise is sufficient to show how the theory differs from standard quantum theory in physical , mathematical , interpretive , and predictive content . in particular",
    ", it shows how quantization can be achieved within a mathematical structure similar to that of newtonian dynamics .",
    "in its current form the theory deals with concepts and systems within the realm of elementary quantum mechanics only .",
    "this limited domain seems to be the appropriate one , however , when the fundamentals of quantum theory are being examined .",
    "not only are the main mysteries of quantum theory already present at that level , but the elementary theory also serves as the foundation for the more advanced theories .",
    "the principles of the theory of discrete extension have not yet been applied to relativistic systems , and its implications for quantum field theory have yet to be established .",
    "nevertheless , the theory already offers insight into the nature of a number of quantum effects such as the zero - point energy of a harmonic oscillator , as shown below .",
    "it also makes a number of testable predictions that distinguish it from standard quantum theory and from bohmian mechanics . as shown below , for example",
    ", it predicts that the frequency of a harmonic oscillator depends on the oscillator s energy . it may be possible to look for this effect experimentally in the field of nanotechnology .",
    "the following additional results have been obtained and will be presented in subsequent papers .",
    "application of the theory to the double slit system shows that the associated interference pattern is the cumulative result of a series of random , but deterministic events .",
    "an analysis of two coupled oscillators demonstrates the quasi - discrete transfer of energy between subsystems .",
    "an analysis of the hydrogen atom shows that the theory generates correct , quasi - discrete values of quantum numbers for a system with three degrees of freedom .",
    "an analysis of distant , entangled subsystems demonstrates the influence of one subsystem on another and introduces the concept of _ energy of entanglement_. finally , the theory shows that wave function collapse is associated with a continuous process that obeys the ordinary equations of clustor dynamics .      in the 20th century",
    "a number of previously unknown physical effects were discovered such as the compton effect and electron diffraction .",
    "these discoveries revealed that light and matter have both particle - like and wave - like aspects to their behaviors .",
    "over the years , various attempts have been made to interpret these new phenomena in terms of classical wave and particle concepts that had been carried over from the 19th century .",
    "the most widely accepted interpretation , the copenhagen interpretation , incorporates these classical concepts through the notions of wave - particle dualism and complementarity  @xcite .",
    "other interpretations , such as schrdinger s unitary wave theory  @xcite , attempt to explain particle - like behavior on the basis of continuum dynamics .",
    "conversely , still other interpretations , such as land s unitary particle theory  @xcite , attempt to explain wave - like interference phenomena on the basis of particle dynamics . finally , interpretations such as the de  broglie - bohm pilot wave theory  @xcite postulate a dual physical basis of particles together with an objectively real field .",
    "these interpretations all rely on the classical wave and particle concepts .",
    "in contrast , the theory of discrete extension is based on the non - classical , unitary concept of a discretely extended object or clustor .",
    "a classical particle is a point - like entity and can be described , therefore , as an _ unextended object_. a classical wave or field is a space - filling entity and can be described as a _ continuously extended object_. in contrast to these classical concepts , a clustor is a single , indivisible entity with multiple , spatially isolated , point - like manifestations .",
    "therefore , with similar terminology , it can be described as a _ discretely extended object_. ( in special cases a clustor can be unextended like a particle , as shown below . )    in standard quantum theory the notion of a particle trajectory is rejected in accordance with the uncertainty principle .",
    "a clustor , on the other hand , has a well - defined spatial trajectory and a continuous space - time world - line . despite its partitioned appearance",
    ", a clustor is an undivided entity whose spatially isolated manifestations , called clustor points , have no individual existence apart from the clustor as a whole .",
    "an entity will be considered to be undivided or whole if its world - line is continuous .    at first , the characteristics of having a partitioned appearance and being undivided seem to be in conflict .",
    "there is no inconsistency , however , because , as shown below , clustor world - lines are , in general , oscillatory and will therefore have multiple intersections with lines of simultaneity .",
    "being both point - like and extended , a clustor is a hybrid object that combines certain attributes of both particles and waves . in particular , the point - like manifestations of a free clustor",
    "can have a spatial distribution that is quasi - periodic .",
    "therefore , in addition to its point - like aspect , such a clustor possesses an attribute that is analogous to the wavelength of a harmonic wave . in future publications",
    "it will be shown that the dynamics of this hybrid object can lead to phenomena that are normally attributed to the interference of physical waves .",
    "although it is possible for a clustor to exist in an unextended state , no such clustors are likely to be found in nature .",
    "any clustor that is found in , or has been specially prepared in , an unextended state is nearly certain to become discretely extended upon interaction with the environment .",
    "this behavior will be illustrated below by an encounter between an unextended free clustor and a rectangular barrier .",
    "thus , naturally occurring clustors are almost certain to be discretely extended due to a history of countless interactions with the environment .",
    "the mathematical theory of clustor dynamics is an extension of newtonian mechanics that takes into account the non - zero value of planck s constant , @xmath0 . as such ,",
    "it is proposed here that the theory is applicable in the microscopic , quantum domain . the starting point for this extension",
    "is the hamilton - jacobi formulation of newtonian theory , a choice that is motivated by the following considerations .      in standard quantum theory",
    "the wave function , @xmath1 , for a one - particle system satisfies schrdinger s equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle s mass , @xmath4 is the potential function , and @xmath5 .",
    "the complex wave function can be expressed in the polar form @xmath6 , and schrdinger s equation is then equivalent to the following coupled , real equations for the amplitude function , @xmath7 , and the phase function , @xmath8 : @xmath9 @xmath10 this decomposition of schrdinger s equation is the basis of the wkb approximation scheme and is used in the development of both the de  broglie - bohm pilot wave theory  @xcite and the theory of discrete extension introduced here .",
    "equation   is a continuity equation that , in standard quantum theory , expresses the conservation of probability .",
    "the real quantities @xmath11 are interpreted there as a probability current density and a probability density , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the complex conjugate of @xmath1 .      in the classical limit with @xmath13 , equation",
    "is uncoupled from @xmath7 and reduces to the time - dependent hamilton - jacobi equation of newtonian theory .",
    "any equation that is uncoupled from @xmath7 will subsequently be called a direct equation .",
    "thus , for @xmath13 , equation   reduces to a direct equation for hamilton s principal function , @xmath14 , where the subscript , @xmath15 , indicates a quantity from newtonian theory .    for stationary states of a conservative system with one degree of freedom , equations   and",
    "can be uncoupled even when @xmath16 . in that case",
    "the wave function has the form @xmath17 $ ] where the constant @xmath18 is the energy of the system .",
    "then , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the function @xmath21 satisfies the following direct , third - order equation : @xmath22\\right]+\\left(\\dfrac{\\hslash}{2}\\right)^{\\!\\!2}\\!\\left[2\\,\\dfrac{{d}w}{{d}x}\\,\\dfrac{{d}^{3}w}{{d}x^{3}}-3\\!\\left(\\dfrac{{d}^{2}w}{{d}x^{2}}\\right)^{\\!\\!2}\\right ] = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{direct eqn for w}\\ ] ] for @xmath13 this equation reduces to the time - independent hamilton - jacobi equation of newtonian theory .",
    "the fact that equations   and   from standard quantum theory reduce to newtonian hamilton - jacobi equations for @xmath13 suggests that newtonian hamilton - jacobi theory can be broadened into a quantum theory when @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the theory of discrete extension adopts as its framework the entire hamilton - jacobi formalism of newtonian theory but with the schrdinger phase function , @xmath8 , playing the role of hamilton s principal function .",
    "the theory adopts this formalism not only for the one - particle systems discussed above , but for systems of arbitrary complexity . in all cases",
    "the generalized principal function , @xmath8 , will satisfy a direct , higher - order equation determined , implicitly , by schrdinger s equation .      at first",
    "this prescription seems impossible . on the one hand ,",
    "hamilton - jacobi theory is based on the mathematical relation that exists between any first - order partial differential equation and its associated system of characteristic , first - order , ordinary differential equations ( hamilton s canonical equations in the case of newtonian theory ) . on the other hand",
    ", no such relation exists for higher - order partial differential equations such as the implicit , direct equation for @xmath8 .",
    "this higher - order equation , however , may have an implicit , first - order , intermediary integral that shares solutions with its parent equation .",
    "in the theory of discrete extension an intermediary integral of this sort plays the role of a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "being of first - order , it is mathematically qualified for that role .",
    "let @xmath23 be the number of degrees of freedom of a given system , and let + @xmath24 be an index for the coordinates , @xmath25 , in the configuration space of that system .",
    "also , let @xmath26 be an index in the extended configuration space that includes time as the coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "reduction of the higher - order equation for @xmath8 to a first - order , intermediary integral will then result in a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a set of arbitrary integration constants that are introduced in the order - reduction process .",
    "the function @xmath30 , which is identically zero , serves as an extended hamiltonian function for the system .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 in this hamiltonian are canonical pairs of coordinates and momenta in the extended phase space of the system .",
    "they include the canonical pair @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy of the system ( not necessarily constant ) .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi formalism requires a complete solution of equation  .",
    "in addition to an additive constant that can be ignored , such a solution , @xmath34 , will contain @xmath23 essential hamilton - jacobi constants , @xmath35 , as well as the set , @xmath29 , of order - reduction constants .",
    "it therefore involves two distinct sets of arbitrary constants , different from each other in both origin and mathematical status .",
    "since @xmath8 depends on the arbitrary constants in the set @xmath29 , the hamilton - jacobi motion equations , @xmath36 , will also depend on them .",
    "these constants comprise non - newtonian data that must be specified in addition to the usual newtonian initial conditions in order to uniquely define the behavior of the system .",
    "the theory of discrete extension is , therefore , richer than newtonian theory in that it permits infinite families of diverse clustor dynamics for any given set of newtonian initial conditions .",
    "in the theory of discrete extension schrdinger s equation is viewed only as an auxiliary mathematical tool for obtaining the real - valued function , @xmath8 , while avoiding the inherent difficulties in the derivation and solution of a non - linear , direct equation for @xmath8 .",
    "the following progression summarizes the logical steps that relate schrdinger s equation to the generalized hamilton - jacobi equation  :    1 .",
    "schrdinger s equation for the wave function , @xmath6 , is second - order , linear , and complex .",
    "it can be decomposed into 2 .",
    "two coupled equations for @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are second - order , non - linear , and real .",
    "elimination of @xmath7 between them leads implicitly to 3 .   a direct equation for @xmath8 which is higher - order , non - linear , and real .",
    "an implicit , first - order , intermediary integral of this implicit equation is then 4 .   the generalized hamilton - jacobi equation , @xmath37 , for @xmath8 .    in the theory of discrete extension the wave function , @xmath1 , has neither the status of a physical field nor an interpretation as either a probability amplitude or a state vector .",
    "its role is simply to lend its phase function , @xmath8 , for use as a generalized principal function in the hamilton - jacobi formalism .      in newtonian theory",
    "the solution , @xmath14 , of the hamilton - jacobi equation is closely related to the newtonian action function . therefore , in the theory of discrete extension , schrdinger s phase function , @xmath8 , which satisfies a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation , will be viewed as a generalized action function and will be referred to simply as the action .",
    "recognition of a close connection between action functions and phase functions is , of course , not new . in the path integral formulation of standard quantum theory , for example",
    ", @xmath38 times the newtonian action integral , @xmath39 , over a given classical path is adopted as the phase of the contribution that the path makes to the total quantum amplitude .",
    "thus , in that theory , the conceptual progression is from an action function to a phase function . in the theory of discrete extension ,",
    "however , the progression is reversed : @xmath40 times the phase of the schrdinger wave function is used in the hamilton - jacobi formalism as a non - classical action function for a theory of clustor dynamics .      both the de  broglie - bohm theory and the theory of discrete extension",
    "have a connection with the hamilton - jacobi formulation of newtonian mechanics , and both make use of the phase function , @xmath8 , in the polar form of schrdinger s wave function .",
    "the two theories also have many differences .",
    "two important areas of disagreement are quantization procedures and motion equations .",
    "the de  broglie - bohm theory made an important conceptual advance by demonstrating that neither indeterminism nor subjectivism are necessary parts of a coherent interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "it can be criticized , however , for interpretive problems of its own .",
    "it postulates a dual physical basis consisting of point particles together with an `` objectively real field ''  @xcite that guides the motions of the particles .",
    "postulating that the pilot wave is objectively real provides the theory with a physical justification for requiring that the mathematical representation of the field be finite , continuous , and single - valued .",
    "that is , it justifies the use of eigenvalue problems to achieve quantization .",
    "this postulate ensures that the theory will generate the same quantization results as standard quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "there are strong arguments , however , against the plausibility of this postulate . unlike a physical object such as the electromagnetic field ,",
    "the pilot field is sourceless and is without an energy density .",
    "furthermore , the influence of the pilot field is independent of its magnitude ; it can be multiplied by an arbitrary constant without changing its effect on the motion of the particles . finally , for a system of @xmath15 particles , it is represented mathematically as a function in the @xmath41-dimensional configuration space of the particles rather than in physical space . for these reasons the pilot field",
    "should be viewed as nothing more than an auxiliary mathematical construct . as a result , there is no physical basis for requiring it to be finite , continuous , and single - valued .",
    "the de  broglie - bohm theory , therefore , lacks a physical justification for using eigenvalue problems to achieve quantization .",
    "( these same comments apply to the quantization procedure of standard quantum mechanics . ) )    the theory of discrete extension , on the other hand , is based on the unitary physical concept of a clustor and does not postulate the existence of an associated physical field .",
    "therefore , in this theory , the mathematical requirements stated above are irrelevant .",
    "as shown below , quantization emerges naturally from the dynamical equations of the theory without the need for supplementary mathematical conditions .",
    "it can also be noted that the de  broglie - bohm theory makes use of only half of the hamilton - jacobi formalism while disregarding the other half . in accordance with the formalism",
    ", it postulates that the momentum components of a particle are given by @xmath42 where the function @xmath8 is adopted as a generalization of hamilton s principal function",
    ". it also postulates , however , that the velocity components of the particle are given by the newtonian expression @xmath43 where @xmath3 is the particle s mass .",
    "the purpose of this second postulate is to preserve the standard probability interpretation of equation   for an ensemble of particles  @xcite . taken together , these two postulates produce motions that are in conflict with the hamilton - jacobi motion equations , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the usual hamilton - jacobi constants .",
    "the de  broglie - bohm theory ignores this set of motion equations .",
    "the theory of discrete extension , on the other hand , employs the entire hamilton - jacobi formalism , including the motion equations . in doing so",
    ", it leads to a new relation between momentum and velocity and a new expression for the probability density of position .",
    "furthermore , the concept of a discretely extended object arises naturally from this mathematical structure due to the oscillatory nature of the world - lines produced by these motion equations .",
    "this section derives the action , momentum , and world - line functions for a given system in terms of a particular wave function , @xmath1 , for that system .",
    "it will be seen in later sections that this particular wave function consists of a specific linear combination of linearly independent solutions of schrdinger s equation and that the coefficients of that linear combination are defined in terms of the non - newtonian constants that comprise the set @xmath29 introduced in section  [ sec : gen h - j eqn ] .      for now , assume that the required linear combination for @xmath1 is given , and let its real and imaginary parts be @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . the action function , @xmath49 , can then be derived in terms of the wave function , @xmath50 , and its value , @xmath51 , at a selected reference point , @xmath52 , in the extended configuration space of the given system .",
    "let @xmath53 by convention .",
    "the wave function then has the form @xmath54 solving for @xmath8 gives @xmath55 this equation is independent of @xmath7 and is therefore a direct equation for @xmath8 .",
    "applying the arctangent addition theorem leads to the simplified equation @xmath56\\,.\\ ] ]    for a stationary state of a conservative system with energy @xmath18 , the wave function has the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the time - independent wave function .",
    "the action function is then @xmath59 .",
    "substituting these expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath8 into equation   gives @xmath60 which is of the same form as equation  .",

    "the probability density for position and the probability current density in the @xmath67 direction are @xmath68 respectively .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath40 is allowed to approach zero in the standard theory , the resultant classical limit leads to an interpretation  @xcite in which @xmath1 describes an ensemble of particles with momentum components @xmath69 . in the theory of discrete extension",
    "the probability interpretations of @xmath70 and @xmath71 do not apply , but it can be seen that for each clustor point the equation @xmath69 is true even when @xmath16 .    for a stationary state of a conservative system @xmath72 , and",

    "it can be seen that as time advances , the clustor , as a whole , moves to the right as new clustor points are created on the right and old clustor points are annihilated on the left .",
    "it is also apparent that the number of clustor points increases or decreases in steps of two and that the total number is always odd .",
    "figure  [ free clustor world - line high activ ] shows the world - line for the more highly activated clustor along with the first few clustor points that exist at time @xmath265 .",
    "the positions of the clustor points are distributed in a nearly periodic pattern .",
    "it can be seen in figures  [ free clustor world - line mod activ ] and  [ free clustor world - line high activ ] that , at any given moment , a clustor s various clustor points are distributed over a range of different spatial positions .",

    "thus , the clustor approaches a stationary state like that of a free particle in the standard theory . like a free particle in the standard theory , there are an infinite number of positions on the real line at which a clustor point could be found .",
    "furthermore , the probability of finding either object at a particular position is uniform over the set of the object s possible positions .",
    "the sets of possible positions for the two objects are not the same , however .",
    "according to the standard theory the possible positions at which a free particle could be found comprise a continuous set that covers the entire line . for a fully activated clustor , on the other hand , the possible positions at which a clustor point could be found comprise only a discrete set of equally spaced points .",
    "it can be seen from the world - lines in figures  [ free clustor world - line mod activ ] and  [ free clustor world - line high activ ] that as the activation level of a clustor is raised , its properties approach those just described for a fully activated clustor .",
    "clustor behavior that is associated with activation due to @xmath270 differs from the behavior that is associated with @xmath271 .",

    "note that in this second case the action and momentum functions assume their newtonian forms in   even though the world - line is non - newtonian and the clustor is discretely extended .",

    "it is shown that if an oscillator has a high degree of quantum activation , then it is discretely extended , and , furthermore , there are quasi - discrete aspects to its dynamics .",
    "it will be seen , for example , that if the energy of the oscillator is smoothly increased , the full - cycle action , @xmath359 , generated by the oscillator remains essentially constant except at integer values of the energy parameter , @xmath350 . at each of these special energy values",
    "the action makes a quasi - discrete transition to a new plateau .    for the quasi - newtonian oscillator discussed above",
    ", the parameters @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 have the newtonian values  . to demonstrate the emergence of quantization due to quantum activation , it is sufficient to consider activation due only to the deviation of the parameter @xmath234 from its newtonian value",
    ". thus , let @xmath361 where the activation parameter , @xmath137 , will be used to raise or lower @xmath234 from the newtonian value .",
    "the parameters @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 will retain their newtonian values in the following discussion .",
    "+             +              the solid curves in figures  [ osc action low activ ] through  [ osc world - line high activ ] illustrate the dynamics of oscillators for both moderate and higher levels of quantum activation . in both cases",
    "@xmath362 so that the value of @xmath234 is less than the newtonian value . for the moderate level @xmath363 , and for the higher level @xmath364 . in all six figures",
    "the energy parameter has the value @xmath328 as in figures  [ quasi - newt osc action high energy ] ,  [ quasi - newt osc momentum high energy ] , and  [ quasi - newt osc world - line high energy ] for the quasi - newtonian oscillator .",
    "the dashed curves in the figures show the behavior of the corresponding newtonian oscillators . in the interest of visual clarity , however , the newtonian curves are omitted from figures  [ osc action high activ ] and  [ osc world - line high activ ] . in figure  [ osc world - line high activ ] , for example",
    ", the picture would have been densely overlaid with twenty newtonian sinusoidal cycles .",
    "as before , the dashed vertical lines represent the classical turning points .",
    "figure  [ osc action low activ ] shows that for the moderate activation level the action function differs little from that of the quasi - newtonian oscillator shown in figure  [ quasi - newt osc action high energy ] . in figure  [ osc action high activ ]",
    ", however , the activation level is higher , and the action function approaches a staircase function , a characteristic of discretely extended systems .    figures  [ osc momentum low activ ] and  [ osc momentum high activ ] show the effect of quantum activation on the oscillator s phase space trajectory . it can be seen that beyond the turning points the trajectories extend to infinity as in the quasi - newtonian case shown in figure  [ quasi - newt osc momentum high energy ] . between the turning points , however , quantum activation causes the trajectories to oscillate around the corresponding newtonian trajectory . at higher activation levels as in figure  [ osc momentum high activ ] ,",
    "the oscillations become high and narrow and approach a series of delta functions .",
    "the motion functions in figure  [ quasi - newt osc world - line high energy ] show that at the higher energy level , @xmath328 , the frequencies of newtonian and quasi - newtonian oscillators are nearly equal . in contrast , the motion functions in figures  [ osc world - line low activ ] and  [ osc world - line high activ ] show that while quantum activation preserves periodicity , it generates a frequency shift away from the newtonian frequency even at the higher energy level , @xmath328 .",
    "higher activation levels produce greater frequency shifts , and as @xmath135 the system approaches a stationary state with an infinitely long period .    in both figures",
    "[ osc world - line low activ ] and  [ osc world - line high activ ] there exist vertical lines of simultaneity that intersect the clustor motion functions at multiple points .",
    "these intersections demonstrate the existence of discrete extension for both activation levels , but show that it is much more pronounced for the higher activation level .",
    "if @xmath135 , the system approaches a stationary state , and the peaks in the world - line function approach a series of delta functions . in the limit ,",
    "the height of these peaks is infinite , but so is the spatial period that contains them .",
    "therefore , in the limit , all vertical lines of simultaneity generate the same static set of clustor points .    quantum activation also arises if @xmath365 so that the value of @xmath234 is greater than the newtonian value . in the limit as @xmath136",
    "the oscillator again approaches a stationary state , but in this case the period is infinitesimal .",
    "again , the peaks in the world - line function approach a series of delta functions .    whether @xmath135 or @xmath136 , it is evident that the associated probability density for clustor point position is sharply peaked around the delta function locations .",
    "figures  [ quasi - newt osc full - cycle action vs energy ] ,  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy mod activ ] , and  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] show an oscillator s full - cycle action , @xmath359 , as a function of its energy for three different levels of quantum activation .",
    "figure  [ quasi - newt osc full - cycle action vs energy ] is associated with the extreme case of a quasi - newtonian oscillator .",
    "figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] is associated with the opposite extreme case of a highly activated oscillator .",
    "figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy mod activ ] corresponds to an oscillator with an intermediate level of activation . in all three figures the dashed straight line represents the full - cycle action of the corresponding newtonian oscillator .",
    "any value of the activation parameter other than @xmath131 is associated with some level of quantum activation .",
    "the values of @xmath137 used in figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy mod activ ] for intermediate activation levels are @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "the values of @xmath137 used in figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] for high activation levels are @xmath368 and @xmath369 .",
    "it can be seen from these figures that as the oscillator s activation level is increased , the quasi - newtonian curve of figure  [ quasi - newt osc full - cycle action vs energy ] evolves toward a quasi - discrete form in two different ways depending on whether @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "the quasi - discrete curves in figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] show that as the energy of a highly activated oscillator is raised , the full - cycle action increases by quasi - discrete increments of magnitude @xmath0 at successive integer values of the energy parameter , @xmath350 . for values of @xmath350 between successive integers ,",
    "the action remains on a plateau with a nearly constant value .",
    "these integer values of the continuous variable @xmath350 are , of course , the energy eigenvalues of standard quantum theory , and the action increments are those specified in the old quantum theory .",
    "thus , the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , @xmath370 is reflected in the theory of discrete extension , not as an ad hoc rule , but as a deduction from the theory .",
    "the action increments belong to alternating sequences of even and odd parity .",
    "when @xmath371 , quasi - discrete increments of size @xmath372 occur at even values of @xmath350 , and when @xmath373 they occur at odd values of @xmath350 .",
    "in addition to these action increments at integer values of @xmath350 , a special action increment of magnitude @xmath0 occurs at the unique half - integer value , @xmath374 .",
    "it is part of the odd - parity sequence and is discussed in the following section in connection with the nature of zero - point energy .",
    "these quasi - discrete action increments can be understood in terms of the behavior of the oscillator s action function   as the energy of the system is raised through a transition point .",
    "figures  [ osc action below trans ] through  [ osc action below next trans ] illustrate the evolution of this function around the transition point , @xmath375 , in the even - parity sequence .",
    "for this example the oscillator is highly activated with @xmath376 . in each of the figures the solid curve shows the oscillator s action as a function of the clustor point coordinate , @xmath105 , where @xmath377 .",
    "the dashed curve is the action function for the corresponding newtonian oscillator , and the dashed vertical lines represent the classical turning points .",
    "+             +            in figure  [ osc action below trans ] the energy value , @xmath378 , is just below the transition point . at this energy level",
    "quasi - discrete action increments of size @xmath261 occur at four clustor point positions . in figure",
    "[ osc action at trans ] the energy has been raised slightly to the integer value @xmath375 .",
    "the action function is now in the midst of an abrupt transition that will lead to the appearance of a new , higher plateau . in figure  [ osc action above trans ]",
    "the energy has been raised slightly again to the value @xmath379 , just above the transition point .",
    "the transition is now complete , and action increments of size @xmath261 occur at six clustor point positions . taken together , the two new action increments add an additional action amount , @xmath0 , to the half - cycle shown .",
    "therefore , in the even - parity sequence , the full - cycle action , @xmath380 , increases abruptly by @xmath372 as the energy passes through the integer value , @xmath375 .",
    "finally , in figure  [ osc action below next trans ] the energy has been raised from @xmath379 to @xmath381 .",
    "it can be seen that throughout the energy range @xmath382 no additional action increments occur in the even - parity sequence .",
    "the oscillator , however , is now on the verge of a new transition at the next even integer , @xmath383 .",
    "according to standard quantum theory the lowest possible energy of an oscillator is the zero - point energy , @xmath321 .",
    "furthermore , the experimental evidence for the apparent existence of this lower bound is extensive and diverse  @xcite .",
    "energies below this value are allowed , however , in the theory of discrete extension , and the theory must explain why oscillators with these lower energies have not been recognized experimentally . this lack of recognition can be understood if it is assumed that naturally - occurring oscillators have a high degree of quantum activation due to prior interactions with their environment .",
    "figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] from the theory of discrete extension shows the full - cycle action of a highly activated oscillator as a function of the oscillator s energy .",
    "the odd - parity sequence reveals a quasi - discrete action increment of size @xmath0 near @xmath374 , i.e. , near @xmath384 .",
    "the existence of this action increment leads to the following explanation for the apparent lower bound on energy at @xmath385 .",
    "if the energy of a highly activated oscillator is gradually reduced to @xmath360 from a higher value , the full - cycle action decreases in a series of quasi - discrete steps as shown in figure  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy high activ ] .",
    "if the energy is then decreased further , the action remains nearly constant at the value @xmath0 and drops to zero suddenly only when @xmath18 reaches a value very near to zero .",
    "therefore , judged on the basis of its ability to generate action , the oscillator s behavior at energies in the range @xmath386 can not be distinguished from its behavior at @xmath387 . for a highly activated oscillator",
    "the existence of these lower energies is , therefore , hidden .",
    "figures  [ quasi - newt osc full - cycle action vs energy ] and  [ osc full - cycle action vs energy mod activ ] show , however , that , for an oscillator with a low or moderate level of quantum activation , the full - cycle action falls to zero smoothly as @xmath388 , and energies below @xmath360 may then be evident experimentally .",
    "the question arises as to how the behavior of a clustor appears to a macroscopic observer in a newtonian world .",
    "the theory of discrete extension specifies the behavior of a clustor by providing an equation   for the clustor s world - line .",
    "the time variable in this equation is specific to the theory of discrete extension and has no _ a  priori _ connection to the time variable of newtonian theory .",
    "furthermore , this world - line inhabits the passive , static realm of space - time and therefore does not , by itself , reveal the active , unfolding dynamics of the clustor .",
    "an active view of the clustor s behavior must be generated by sweeping a line of simultaneity through space - time and noting the progression of its intersections with the clustor s world - line . to determine the unfolding dynamics as seen by a macroscopic observer",
    ", the line of simultaneity must be swept at a rate that represents the uniform flow of newtonian time . to accomplish this goal , a relation must be found between the time variable of the theory of discrete extension and the time variable of newtonian theory .",
    "such a relation can be determined as follows .    according to the newtonian law of inertia , equal increments of classical time",
    "are associated with equal changes in the position of a newtonian free particle .",
    "the motion of such a particle can therefore be used to define the uniform flow of newtonian time .",
    "similarly , the motion of an unextended free clustor can be used to define the uniform flow of time in the theory of discrete extension .",
    "as seen above in section  [ sec : free clustor dynamics ] , however , the equations that describe the behaviors of an unextended free clustor and a newtonian free particle are identical .",
    "therefore , it will be assumed that newtonian time and the time defined by the motion of an unextended free clustor are identical .",
    "the observed changes , @xmath389 , in the position of an unextended free clustor thus provide the theory of discrete extension with a self - contained standard for the uniform progression of newtonian time , namely @xmath390 . therefore , if a line of simultaneity sweeps through space - time according to this standard of uniformity and at this rate , the progression of its intersections with the world - line of any clustor , free or not , will reveal that clustor s behavior as seen by a macroscopic observer .",
    "at any given moment a clustor will , in general , have a multitude of clustor points .",
    "the question arises as to how the clustor s mass , @xmath3 , is distributed among its various points at that moment .",
    "a hypothesis can be made based on the following considerations :    1 .   at each moment",
    "the various clustor points can be divided into two classes based on the sign of the world - line derivative , @xmath391 . if @xmath392 at the location of a given clustor point , that point will be called a positive point .",
    "if @xmath393 , it will be called a negative point . since all clustor points in a given class have the same character and status , it is natural to assume that they all have the same mass .",
    "2 .   as time goes on , clustor points may appear or disappear , but they always do so in pairs consisting of one point from each class . 3 .",
    "the number of clustor points is always odd with one excess positive point in addition to a number of pairs of positive and negative points .",
    "4 .   in a non - relativistic theory",
    "the conservation of mass requires that the total mass of all the clustor points remains constant even as the number of clustor points increases or decreases .",
    "negative points move in the direction of decreasing @xmath105 , and yet the dynamic equations of the theory generate positive values for the momenta of such points .    based on these considerations ,",
    "the theory of discrete extension tentatively assigns a mass value of @xmath3 to each positive clustor point and @xmath394 to each negative clustor point .",
    "the combined mass of each positive / negative pair is then zero , and the mass of the one unpaired , positive point is @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the total mass of the clustor remains constant in time at the correct value , @xmath3 , even as the number of clustor points rises or falls .",
    "furthermore , assigning a negative mass value to the negative points is consistent with the positive momentum values generated for such points by the theory .    in order for this assignment of positive and negative mass values to be consistent with the theory s dynamical equations , it is also necessary to assign a positive energy value , @xmath18 , to positive clustor points and a negative value , @xmath395 , to negative clustor points .",
    "this conclusion can be made plausible by the following considerations :    1 .   at negative",
    "clustor points the mass is @xmath394 , and the momentum factor , @xmath396 , would be imaginary unless the energy is also negative .",
    "2 .   consider potential functions , @xmath200 , such as the harmonic oscillator potential , that are proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "for such potentials both terms , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , on the right side of the energy equation   are negative when the mass is negative .",
    "therefore this equation yields a negative energy , @xmath18 , for negative clustor points .",
    "3 .   for this same class of potential functions , schrdinger s equation   and its solutions",
    "are invariant with respect to simultaneous sign changes of @xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "similar considerations with regard to the coulomb potential and a clustor s electric charge imply that charge should be distributed among the clustor points in the same way that mass is distributed , i.e. , with opposite signs at positive and negative clustor points .",
    "it is hoped that the concepts of negative mass and energy introduced here will find a natural interpretation in a relativistic version of the theory of discrete extension .",
    "just as negative energy electron states in the dirac electron theory were able to be re - interpreted as positive energy anti - particle states , it is anticipated that a similar re - interpretation for negative clustor points will be possible .",
    "furthermore , given the equivalence of mass and energy in a relativistic theory , the issues of negative mass and negative energy would be expected to be resolved simultaneously .    in the theory of discrete extension , space",
    "is occupied by countless , far - flung pairs of positive and negative clustor points associated with a myriad of highly activated clustors , free and otherwise .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ free clustor world - line mod activ ] , these pairs spontaneously appear and disappear from space as prescribed by the equations of clustor dynamics .",
    "this activity resembles the activity of virtual particle / antiparticle pairs in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , it is conjectured that clustor point pairs and virtual particle / antiparticle pairs would have similar implications regarding the nature of the quantum vacuum .",
