    "<S> graphene nanoflakes are interesting because electrons are naturally confined in these quasi zero - dimensional structures , whereas confinement in bulk graphene would require a bandgap . </S>",
    "<S> vacancies inside the graphene lattice lead to localized states and the spins of such localized states may be used for spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a tight - binding description of a nanoflake with two vacancies and include a perpendicular magnetic field via a peierls phase . the tunnel coupling strength and from it the exchange coupling between the localized states can be obtained from the energy splitting between numerically calculated bonding and antibonding energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to estimate the exchange coupling @xmath0 , which governs the dynamics of coupled spins . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the possibility of switching in - situ from @xmath1 to @xmath2 by tuning the magnetic field . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state will be antiferromagnetic with nel temperatures accessible by experiment . </S>"
