    "collisions with the oh radicals were studied by sending supersonic beams of he atoms or d@xmath1 molecules through the trap .",
    "information on the total collision cross sections could be inferred from the beam - induced trap loss that occurs through elastic as well as inelastic collisions .",
    "the collision energy was varied from 60  to 230  @xmath2 for collisions with he and from 145 to 510 @xmath2 for collisions with d@xmath1 by changing the temperature of the pulsed solenoid valve used to produce the supersonic beams .",

    "@xcite ; we here limit ourselves to a brief summary",
    ".    a pulsed supersonic beam of oh radicals in the @xmath11 state is produced by photolysis of nitric acid seeded in an inert carrier gas .",
    "the oh radicals that reside in the upper @xmath9-doublet component of @xmath12 parity are decelerated , guided , or accelerated with the use of a 2.6  meter long stark decelerator that is used in the so - called @xmath13 operation mode @xcite .",
    "the oh radicals are scattered with a neat beam of he atoms or d@xmath1 molecules at a distance of 16.5  mm from the exit of the decelerator .",
    "the beams scatter under 90@xmath14 angle of incidence and collisions take place in a field free region .",
    "the density of the he and d@xmath1 molecular beams are kept sufficiently low to ensure single collision conditions .    the beam of d@xmath1 molecules is produced using a gas of normal d@xmath1 , and both ortho - d@xmath1 and para - d@xmath1 molecules contribute therefore to the measured state - to - state inelastic cross sections . according to the statistical weights , 67% and 33% of the d@xmath1 molecules",
    "are expected to reside in a rotational state belonging to ortho and para - d@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the rotational energy level diagram of d@xmath1 is schematically shown in figure [ fig : energy - level - scheme ] .",
    "the energy level spacing between the lowest rotational states is large , and the d@xmath1 molecules are expected to predominantly reside in the @xmath15 and the @xmath5 levels under our experimental conditions .",
    "the collision energy is varied by tuning the velocity of the oh radicals , and by choosing different temperatures for the solenoid valve used to produce the he and d@xmath1 beams .",
    "the mean forward velocity of the he / d@xmath1 beam is measured by two microphone based beam detectors placed 300  mm apart . for a given temperature of the valve ,",
    "similar beam speeds are measured for he and d@xmath1 as is to be expected for beam particles of identical mass .",
    "the lowest collision energies are obtained when the solenoid valve is cooled to near liquid nitrogen temperatures , resulting in a minimum mean beam velocity of 996  m / s for he and 1042  m / s for d@xmath1 .",
    "these velocities are expected for particles with a mass of 4  atomic units and near liquid nitrogen nozzle temperatures .",
    "the slightly higher speeds that are measured for d@xmath1 beams are attributed to the extra degrees of freedom of the d@xmath1 rotor compared to he .",
    "the lowest collision energy amounts to 120  @xmath2 and 150  @xmath2 for oh - he and oh - d@xmath1 , respectively . in the experiment by sawyer _",
    "_ , a minimum collision energy of @xmath3 60  @xmath2 for oh - he and @xmath3 145  @xmath2 for oh - d@xmath1 was obtained @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the significantly lower collision energy for oh - he that was reached in that experiment is not due to the use of trapped oh radicals .",
    "a center of mass collision energy of @xmath3 60  @xmath2 for collisions between stationary oh radicals and helium atoms requires a he atom velocity of @xmath3 670 m / s .",
    "this is much lower than the expected velocity for a supersonic beam of helium atoms at the temperature used , and the atomic beam that was employed by sawyer _",
    "_ is believed to have been effusive - like @xcite .",
    "collision energies up to 400  @xmath2 for oh - he and 500  @xmath2 for oh - d@xmath1 are reached by tuning the velocity of the oh radicals between 168 and 741  m / s , and by using temperatures of 293  k , 253  k , 213  k , 173  k , 133  k , and 93  k for the valve producing the he / d@xmath1 beam . the width ( full width at half maximum ) of the collision energy distribution depends on the collision energy , and ranges from @xmath3 20 @xmath2 at the lowest collision energies to @xmath3 60 @xmath2 at the highest collision energies .",
    "collisional excitation of the oh radicals up to the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 state is measured .",
    "these rotational states are schematically shown in the rotational energy level diagram in figure [ fig : energy - level - scheme ] , and are referred to hereafter as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are used to indicate the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 spin - orbit manifolds , respectively .",
    "the inelastically scattered oh radicals are state - selectively detected via saturated laser induced fluorescence using different rotational transitions of the @xmath23 band .",
    "the off - resonant fluorescence is collected at right angles and imaged into a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "the diameter of the laser beam is approximately 8  mm , providing a detection volume that is larger than the intersection volume of both beams .",
    "the experiment runs at a repetition rate of 10  hz . the beam that provides the collision partner",
    "is operated every second shot of the experiment , and the collision signal results as the signal intensity difference of alternating shots of the experiment .",
    "the collision energy is varied in a quasi - continuous cycle , as has been described in detail in ref .",
    "for the strongest scattering channels , the fluorescence signals are recorded using an analog mode of detection ; the weak signals are analyzed using photon counting .",
    "both modes of signal acquisition are calibrated with respect to each other .",
    "to relate the measured signal intensities to collision induced populations , the different excitation rates for the different branches of the optical transitions used to probe the different rotational levels are taken into account in the data analysis @xcite .",
    "the measured relative populations in the various rotational states directly reflect inelastic cross sections .",
    "no density - to - flux transformation is required for crossed beam scattering experiments using a light particle as collision partner @xcite .",
    "the validity of this assumption is verified by a measurement of the variation of the relative collision signals as a function of time in the overlapping beams .",
    "no variation was recorded in the experiment , in agreement with model calculations of the detection probabilities of the scattered molecules .",
    "we now describe the theoretical methods used to calculate the cross sections for the inelastic scattering between oh radicals and he atoms ; a discussion of the experimental relative cross sections is given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "below we briefly describe the scattering methodology relevant for the oh - he system and some of the details of the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interaction between the open shell oh(@xmath26 ) radical and a spherical he atom is described by two pes s @xmath27 and @xmath28 , having @xmath29 and @xmath30 reflection symmetry in the plane containing the oh radical and the he atom @xcite .",
    "the pes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 symmetry describes the oh - he interaction where the oh radical has its singly occupied @xmath31 orbital in and perpendicular to the triatomic plane , respectively . in scattering calculations",
    "it is more convenient to construct the average potential @xmath32 and the half - difference potential @xmath33 of these pes s @xcite .",
    "the hibridon program suite was used to carry out fully - quantum , close - coupling calculations of integral state - to - state scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "the channel basis was chosen to ensure convergence of the integral cross sections for all @xmath34 transitions with @xmath35 11.5 .",
    "the calculated inelastic cross sections were converged to within 0.01 @xmath7 .",
    "in figures [ fig : results_f1 ] and [ fig : results_f2 ] , the measured relative state - to - state inelastic scattering cross sections to levels in the @xmath36 manifold ( spin - orbit conserving collisions ) and the @xmath37 manifold ( spin - orbit changing collisions ) , respectively , are shown .",
    "the cross sections that are obtained for the collision partners he and d@xmath1 are displayed in the left and right hand side of these figures . the scattering channels that correspond to excitation of the oh radicals to the two different @xmath9-doublet components of a given rotational state are grouped together . in the upper panels , the scattering channel that populates the @xmath24 state",
    "is shown together with the channels that populate both @xmath9-doublet components of the @xmath38 rotational state . to facilitate a direct comparison between the scattering cross sections for oh - he and oh - d@xmath1 ,",

    "the theoretically calculated cross sections for the scattering of oh with he , convoluted with the experimental energy resolution , are included as solid curves in the left panels .      in the collision energy range that is probed ,",
    "the rotational inelastic scattering of oh @xmath39 radicals with he atoms is dominated by excitation to the @xmath40 state .",
    "the @xmath24 channel , corresponding to collisions that induce the @xmath41 @xmath9-doublet transition in the oh radical , appears rather weak .",
    "this is in contrast with the scattering of oh radicals with ar and xe atoms for which the @xmath24 channel is the dominant inelastic scattering channel @xcite . the scattering channel populating the @xmath42 state appears exceptionally large , also at variance with the corresponding cross sections for the collision partners ar and xe .    for spin - orbit manifold conserving collisions",
    ", there is a strong propensity for final states of @xmath43 parity .",

    "collisions that populate the @xmath42 and @xmath46 states are approximately two orders of magnitude more effective than collisions populating the @xmath47 and @xmath48 states , respectively .    at high collision energies , the relative state - to - state cross sections and the propensities",
    "are consistent with the observations by schreel _",
    "_ @xcite . in that experiment , however , the strong propensities were partially concealed due to a sizable initial population in the @xmath49 state @xcite .",
    "the almost perfect quantum state purity of the packets of oh radicals that are used in the present experiment enables to unambiguously measure the cross sections of transitions to final states that are only weakly coupled to the @xmath25 initial state .    throughout the range of collision energies ,",
    "a good agreement is found with the computed cross sections .",
    "the relative scattering cross sections and the propensities for transitions to one of the @xmath9-doublet components of the final rotational state , are reproduced well .",
    "the largest difference between theory and experiment is found for the @xmath42 channel .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the physical origin of the general behavior of the scattering cross sections and in particular the @xmath9-doublet propensities .",
    "a general picture of the scattering of @xmath4 molecules with spherical objects has been developed by dagdigian _",
    "@xcite , and has been applied to the inelastic scattering of oh radicals with atomic collision partners before @xcite . from the formal quantum analysis of the scattering , it follows that the coupling between rotational states can be evaluated from @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the rotational quantum number of the oh radical , @xmath52 is the symmetry index of the rotational state , and @xmath53 is the projection of @xmath51 onto the internuclear axis . primed quantum numbers indicate the post - collision conditions .",
    "the terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the expansion coefficients of the average and difference potentials in terms of regular and associated legendre polynomials , respectively .",
    "the sum in equation ( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) is performed over the expansion index @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath57 is only nonzero for states that are coupled by the interaction potential , and needs for our analysis no further discussion .",
    "essential in the understanding of the inelastic cross sections are the values for the @xmath54 and the @xmath55 coefficients , and the role of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 factors . both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are independent of the interaction potential , and are determined exclusively by the rotational energy level structure of the molecule .",
    "the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 for oh radicals in the @xmath8 level are tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a pure hund s case ( a ) molecule , the values for @xmath59 are zero for spin - orbit manifold conserving collisions",
    ", whereas the factors @xmath58 are zero for spin - orbit manifold changing collisions",
    ". consequently , spin - orbit conserving and spin - orbit changing transitions are induced exclusively by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . within each manifold , @xmath62 parity changing collisions are governed by the terms for which @xmath63 odd , while @xmath62 parity conserving collisions are described by the @xmath64 even terms .",
    "the propensities for preferred excitation to the @xmath43 or @xmath12 component of a final rotational state originate from the different values for the relevant products @xmath65 or @xmath66 that govern these transitions .    for molecules like oh that can not be described by a pure hund s case ( a ) coupling scheme , both the factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 are nonzero , and interference between the average and difference potentials occurs .",
    "the @xmath67 electronic ground state of the oh radical originates from a @xmath68 electron occupancy , leading to predominantly positive values for @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite . as a result , final states for which the dominant @xmath58 and @xmath59 factors have equal signs are coupled more strongly to the @xmath25 initial state than final states for which @xmath58 and @xmath59 have opposite signs .",
    "the former is the case for the final states of @xmath43 parity in the @xmath36 spin - orbit manifold , and for final states of @xmath12 parity in the @xmath37 manifold , contributing to the observed propensities .",
    "the anomalous propensity that is observed for the @xmath42 state can be understood from equation ( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) .",
    "excitation into the @xmath47 state is governed exclusively by @xmath69 in combination with a small value for @xmath70 , while the @xmath71 term in combination with a large value for @xmath72 dominates the excitation into the @xmath42 state @xcite .",
    "the measured relative state - to - state cross sections directly yield qualitative information on the expansion coefficients of the potential energy surfaces that govern the scattering between oh and he .",
    "collisions that populate the @xmath24 and @xmath49 states are governed by the coefficients for which @xmath73 odd , while the cross sections for excitation to the @xmath40 state is governed by the @xmath73 even coefficients .",
    "the observed ratio of the state - to - state cross sections indicates that the leading @xmath73 even terms @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath71 contribute significantly to the interaction potential .",
    "the relatively large cross section for spin - orbit changing collisions populating the @xmath42 state , as well as the strong propensities that are generally observed , suggests that the @xmath71 coefficient of the difference potential plays a significant role in the scattering between oh radicals and he atoms .",
    "these effects can be rationalized by the nature of the oh - he interaction potential .",
    "the interaction between oh and he is rather weak and the anisotropy of the potential energy surface is small .",
    "the @xmath28 pes has two shallow and almost equally deep potential wells for the collinear oh - he and the ho - he geometry , with well depths of 27  @xmath2 and 22  @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "consequently , the @xmath73 even coefficients that describe the head - tail symmetric parts of the potential energy surfaces contribute significantly to the scattering .",
    "the inelastic scattering of oh radicals with d@xmath1 molecules shows interesting differences compared to oh - he .",
    "the largest cross section is observed for collisions that populate the @xmath24 state . for the channels that populate the @xmath38 states ,",
    "a propensity for the @xmath9-doublet component of @xmath43 symmetry is observed for low collision energies , that vanishes for collision energies of about 500 @xmath2 .",
    "the other scattering channels show only modest propensities .",
    "the spin - orbit changing collisions appear rather weak .",
    "although the formalism that was applied above to the scattering of oh with he does not strictly apply to non - spherical collision partners , we can use the formalism to obtain a physical interpretation of the differences between the scattering of oh with he and d@xmath1 .",
    "this comparison is particularly interesting , as both collision partners have equal mass , and mass effects in the dynamics cancel .",
    "the interaction of d@xmath1 molecules with oh radicals is stronger and induction forces are more important than for the interaction between oh and he .",
    "this suggests that the pes is less head - tail symmetric in comparison to oh - he , and the coefficients of the potential for which @xmath73 odd gain importance compared to the @xmath73 even coefficients .",
    "this results in a larger cross section for @xmath9-doublet changing collisions populating the @xmath24 state , smaller spin - orbit changing transitions , and less pronounced propensities for preferred excitation to one of the two components of a @xmath9-doublet .",
    "similar effects have been observed in state - to - state inelastic scattering experiments of oh radicals with polar collision partners such as co@xmath1 and hcl @xcite .    in the relative inelastic scattering",
    "cross sections , no effect is seen from the internal rotational degrees of freedom of the d@xmath1 molecule .",
    "in particular , no strong variation of the cross sections at collision energies around 300 @xmath2 is observed , that could be indicative of resonant energy transfer between the oh and the d@xmath1 rotors @xcite .",
    "we have presented measurements of the state - to - state rotational inelastic scattering of stark - decelerated oh ( @xmath76 ) radicals with he atoms and d@xmath1 molecules in the 100 - 500  @xmath2 collision energy range .",
    "the collision energy dependence of the relative inelastic scattering cross sections , the threshold behavior of inelastic channels , and the energy dependence of the state - resolved propensities are accurately determined . for the scattering of oh with he , good agreement is found with the inelastic scattering cross sections determined from quantum close - coupled scattering calculations based on high - quality _ ab initio _ oh - he pes s .",
    "the almost perfect quantum state purity of the stark - decelerated packets of oh radicals eliminates the contamination of the scattering signals by initial populations in excited rotational states .",
    "this facilitates a quantitative study of collision induced transitions to states that are only weakly coupled to the initial state , and enables the observation of the exceptionally strong propensities for the inelastic scattering between oh radicals and he atoms .",
    "the genuine relative state - to - state inelastic scattering cross sections that are measured allow for a more accurate comparison with computed cross sections than hitherto possible .",
    "significant differences are found between the inelastic scattering of oh - he and oh - d@xmath1 .",
    "although no rigorous quantum calculations have been performed for oh - d@xmath1 , these differences can be understood from the different nature of the oh - d@xmath1 interaction potential .",
    "no effect of the rotational degrees of freedom of the d@xmath77 molecule has been observed in the relative inelastic scattering cross sections .    our measurements on the low - energy scattering between oh radicals and he / d@xmath1 complement recent scattering experiments in which pulsed beams of he / d@xmath1 are directed through a sample of magnetically trapped oh radicals .",
    "in that experiment , inelastic collisions , as well as elastic collisions that impart a sufficient amount of kinetic energy to the oh radicals , lead to a reduced number of oh radicals in the trap .",
    "recent quantum scattering calculations , based on the same pes s as used in the present work , have not been able to reproduce the trap loss observations for oh - he , however .",
