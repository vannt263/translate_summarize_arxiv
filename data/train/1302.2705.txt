    "the magneto - caloric effect ( mce ) is a temperature change of magnetic material through the application or removal of an external magnetic field .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the field variation of the entropy and has been of considerable interest for their potential applications and underlying physics  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of mce has long been used to map out the magnetic phase diagram , and the combination with the specific heat measurement allows us to determine the order of the phase transition  @xcite and the field evolution of entropy  @xcite . because of the unique abilities of the mce measurements , a lot of experimental techniques have been developed  @xcite .    in spite of the potential to extend the accessible magnetic field range , the mce measurements in a pulsed field",
    "have been limited by the difficulties of the thermometry in the short pulse duration .",
    "one of the possible way to obtain mce data in pulsed field was described by levitin _",
    "here they measured the adiabatic magnetization curve of gd@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ggg ) in the extremely short pulse duration of 9 ms and compared it with the calculated isothermal magnetization curve . since the difference between the adiabatic and the isothermal magnetization curves stems from the change in temperature as a function of magnetic fields , the comparison between them yields the mce indirectly , as long as the calculation of the isothermal magnetization curve is valid . on the other hand , by applying a traditional way of the thermometry used thermocouple , dankov _ et al .",
    "_ directly measured the adiabatic mce in pulse magnetic fields up to 8 t and in the temperature range between 200 k and 350 k  @xcite . here",
    ", they embedded a thin copper - constantan thermocouple in a polycrystalline specimen and achieved the rapid response of the thermometry necessary for a pulsed filed experiment .",
    "although a thermocouple is an adequate choice for the thermometry in a pulsed field , the accessible ranges of temperatures and magnetic fields are restricted by the sensitivity of the thermocouple .",
    "more recently , the direct mce measurement in the quasi - adiabatic limit was carried out below 8 k and magnetic field up to 60 t  @xcite .",
    "this technique used a small chip of a resistive thermometer and achieved sufficiently fast response time for the thermometry while maintaining its sensitivity .",
    "however , because of the heat loss during the measurement , the quasi - adiabatic mce experiment in the pulsed field is unable to obtain the field variation of the entropy .    in this context",
    ", we design a new apparatus for an accurate direct measurement of the adiabatic mce over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields .",
    "the temperature is measured by a resistive film thermometer fabricated on the sample surface , and the apparatus was tested through the measurements of gd and ggg .",
    "the results agree with the previous reports , and the experimental technique described in this article can be used to measure the adiabatic mce in pulse magnetic fields up to 55 t in the temperature region between 6 k and 300 k.",
    "let us start with the following thermodynamic equation for a reversible process , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 represents the heat exchanged with the surroundings .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the entropy , temperature and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the first term of the right - hand side can be expressed as @xmath8 by using the heat capacity at the fixed field ( @xmath9 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the second term corresponds to the released heat caused by the field - induced change in the entropy . in the real system",
    ", we have to take into account finite heat exchange between the sample and the thermal bath .",
    "with introducing the thermal conductance @xmath10 , the heat balance equation is as follows : @xmath11 here , the subscripts of `` s '' and `` b '' represent the sample and the thermal bath , respectively .",
    "if the @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 as well , is large enough , the heat leak term in the left - hand side of the eq . [ cs ] became negligible : the adiabatic condition can be effectively accomplished . hence , the fast field - sweep rate of the pulsed field is advantageous to realize the adiabatic measurements . in the purely adiabatic condition [ @xmath14 in eq .",

    "therefore , the mce [ @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 this equation expresses the fact that the system temperature changes isentropically when the measurement is performed in an adiabatic condition .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic mce measurement monitors temperature at which the total entropy of the system remains constant as a function of magnetic field .",
    "for example , when the spin entropy of the system decrease by the application of the external magnetic field as seen in the paramagnetic system ( negative @xmath20 in eq .",
    "[ dt ] ) , the system attempts to keep the total entropy , and the temperature of the system is raised .",
    "the opposite situation ( positive @xmath20 and negative mce ) can occur in the typical antiferromagnetic system  @xcite , where the antiferromagnetically ordered ( low entropy ) state is destroyed by the application of the magnetic field , leading to the negative mce . in this manner",
    ", the sign of the mce relates to the underlying magnetic structure .",

    "the thermometer strongly connects to the sample , and its thermal conductance is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "the sample is mounted on the thermal bath via a weak thermal link with the thermal conductance , @xmath10 .",

    "[ ad ] ( a ) has been studied for modeling the relaxation and quasi - adiabatic calorimeters  @xcite . when the conditions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are satisfied , it is known that the time constant to reach temperature homogeneity between the sample and thermal bath is given by @xmath26 . in the same conditions , the thermal time constant between the sample and thermometer is given by @xmath27 . when the time scale of the mce measurement is much shorter than @xmath28 , the system can not exchange the heat to the surroundings which is regarded as an adiabatic condition .",
    "the time scale of the mce measurement can be roughly approximated by the pulsed field duration , @xmath29 , and the requirement condition for reaching an adiabatic condition during the measurement is given by @xmath30 .",
    "when the @xmath31 is longer than the characteristic time of the measurement ( @xmath29 ) , the thermometer can not respond to the change in @xmath32 .",

    "<S> magneto - caloric effects ( mces ) measurement system in adiabatic condition is proposed to investigate the thermodynamic properties in pulsed magnetic fields up to 55 t. with taking the advantage of the fast field - sweep rate in pulsed field , adiabatic measurements of mces were carried out at various temperatures . to obtain the prompt response of the thermometer in the pulsed field , </S>",
    "<S> a thin film thermometer is grown directly on the sample surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the present setup was demonstrated in the wide temperature range through the measurements on gd at about room temperature and on gd@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the both results show reasonable agreement with the data reported earlier . by comparing the mce data with the specific heat data </S>",
    "<S> , we could estimate the entropy as functions of magnetic field and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate the possibility that our approach can trace the change in transition temperature caused by the external field . </S>"
