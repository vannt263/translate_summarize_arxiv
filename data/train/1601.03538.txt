    "thermal fluctuations in fluids in nonequilibrium steady states are large and very long ranged  @xcite .",
    "these nonequilibrium fluctuations are particularly spectacular in fluids in the presence of a temperature or concentration gradient .",
    "they arise from a coupling between the heat - diffusion or mass - diffusion mode and the viscous mode through the convective term in the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations  @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to study fluctuation - induced forces in liquid mixtures in the presence of a concentration gradient .",
    "such a concentration gradient may either be isothermal  @xcite , or it may be the result of a temperature gradient through the soret effect  @xcite .",
    "a brief account of our principal results has been presented in a recent letter  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study this nonequilibrium ( ne ) casimir effect in liquid mixtures in more detail .",
    "we shall proceed as follows . in section  [ s2 ] we derive the relationship between the ne fluctuation - induced pressure and the ne concentration fluctuations . in dealing with the ne fluctuations in liquid mixtures",
    "we shall use a frequently adopted large - lewis - number approximation , in which concentration fluctuations and temperature fluctuations decouple . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we consider the intensity of the ne concentration fluctuations deduced from ne fluctuating hydrodynamics .",

    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in section  [ s5 ] . in the appendix",
    "we relate the pressure expansion equation for the fluctuation - induced pressure derived in section  [ s2 ] to the usual statistical mechanical definition of the pressure .",
    "to derive the expression for a nonequilibrium fluctuation - induced pressure , we consider the pressure as a function of the fluctuating conserved densities , which for a liquid mixture are the fluctuating energy density @xmath0 , the fluctuating mass density @xmath1 of component 1 ( solute ) and the fluctuating mass density @xmath2 of component 2 ( solvent ) : @xmath3 we expand @xmath4 in a taylor series in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . dealing with the slow mass - diffusion mode , we can neglect the fast propagating sound modes , and , hence the linear fluctuation contribution to the pressure : @xmath8 retaining only terms quadratic in the fluctuations , we thus obtain for the taylor expansion of @xmath9 : @xmath10 + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial ^{2 } p}{\\partial \\rho _ { 2}^{2 } } \\right)_{e,\\rho_1}{\\mkern-11mu } \\left(\\delta \\rho _ { 2 } \\right)^{2 } +   2\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial ^{2 } p}{\\partial e\\partial \\rho _ { 1 } } \\right)\\delta e\\delta \\rho _ { 1}\\\\[14pt ] + 2\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial ^{2 } p}{\\partial e\\partial \\rho _ { 2 } } \\right)\\delta e\\delta \\rho _ { 2 } + 2\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial ^{2 } p}{\\partial \\rho _ { 1 } \\partial \\rho _ { 2 } } \\right)\\delta \\rho _ { 1 } \\delta \\rho _ { 2 } \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] in liquid mixtures there are two diffusion modes that are linear combination of heat diffusion and mass diffusion  @xcite .",
