    "closed subshifts over finite alphabets are much studied dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "their understanding in one dimension is a cornerstone of the theory of ( symbolic ) dynamical systems , while systems in higher dimensions show many new phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is probably fair to say that in the latter case , despite great effort , the open questions still prevail .",
    "the class of symbolic dynamical systems ( over finite alphabets ) is special also in the sense that they possess finitely many ( non - periodic ) factors ( up to isomorphism ) , where the term ` factor ' refers to symbolic dynamical systems that are the image of a homomorphism which commutes with the shift action ( and not to finite subwords ) .",
    "nevertheless , the factors are rarely used explicitly to unravel ( details of ) the structure of the dynamical system . for certain aspects ,",
    "however , they carry relevant information , and can be employed both for structural insight and for concrete calculations .",
    "this is particularly true for the spectral theory of symbolic dynamics .",
    "the latter comes in two flavors .",
    "the traditional point of view is via the _ dynamical _ spectrum @xcite , which analyzes the induced shift action on the hilbert space of square integrable functions on the shift space ( relative to an invariant probability measure ) .",
    "an alternative approach works with the _ diffraction _ spectrum @xcite of a typical sequence in the space , which was originally motivated by the physical process of kinematic diffraction @xcite .",
    "its relevance increased with the discovery of quasicrystals by shechtman et al .",
    "@xcite , particularly for systems with pure point ( or bragg ) diffraction .",
    "recent evidence @xcite suggests that also continuous spectral components are practically relevant .",
    "it is well understood by now that ( and how ) the two types of spectra are equivalent in the pure point case @xcite , while it has long been known that the dynamical spectrum is generally richer in the presence of continuous components @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in many of the classic examples , the complete dynamical spectrum can be reconstructed from the diffraction spectrum of the system and of some of its factors .",
    "this can be made more precise for systems of symbolic dynamics as well as for delone dynamical systems with finite local complexity @xcite .",
    "we will see examples of this type below , selected from the class of substitution systems with integer inflation factor ; see @xcite for background material .",
    "yet another , and rather recent , aspect is the topological structure of tiling spaces ; see @xcite and references therein . here , the substitution or the inflation structure can effectively be used to calculate the ech cohomology , for instance via the methods introduced in @xcite .",
    "this provides concrete results , but their ( geometric ) interpretation is still difficult .",
    "this is another instance where the careful inspection of the factors can help to understand the detailed structure of the cohomology groups .",
    "we will explain this in some detail for a recently analyzed example , the so - called squiral tiling of the plane @xcite .",
    "our approach in this article is example - oriented , wherefore we opted for a somewhat informal presentation , in the interest of better readability .",
    "we assume the reader to be familiar with the basic concepts of ( symbolic ) dynamics , compare @xcite , and with some results from their spectral theory , see @xcite for more .",
    "we begin with an example in one dimension that is deliberately designed to have interesting factors , and a rather rich spectrum as a result of this .",
    "we continue with some remarks on substitution factors with maximal pure point spectrum , before we embark on a more detailed analysis of the squiral tiling @xcite and its substitution factors .",
    "this is followed by a similar ( though still somewhat preliminary ) analysis of the classic table tiling @xcite .",
    "undeniably , the best studied substitution rule ( on the binary alphabet @xmath0 ) is given by @xmath1 and known as the fibonacci substitution ( or morphism ) .",
    "it defines a unique hull @xmath2 that is strictly ergodic as a dynamical system under the action of the ( two - sided ) shift ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has pure point dynamical as well as pure point diffraction spectrum . in a similar way",
    ", one can treat all ( repetitive ) sturmian sequences , a common feature being that they can all be described as model sets ( also known as cut and project sets ) ; see @xcite as well as @xcite for a survey .",
    "the equivalence of the two types of spectra is well understood for systems of this kind @xcite .",
    "the relation between the dynamical and the diffraction spectrum is more complicated in the presence of continuous spectral components .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite for the example of the thue - morse substitution , where the dynamical spectrum is richer . in particular , a substantial part of the pure point spectrum does not show up in the diffraction measure of the thue - morse chain , while it can be recovered from the diffraction of the period doubling chain .",
    "the hull of the latter is a factor of the thue - morse system @xcite .",
    "an analogous phenomenon was described in @xcite for a system with close - packed dimers on @xmath3 , and is known to also occur for the rudin - shapiro chain @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to illustrate these connections with a single substitution rule that entails a mixed spectrum and possesses most of the above examples as factors .",
    "let us consider the alphabet @xmath4 and define the primitive substitution @xmath5 which results in a unique hull , for instance via the two - sided sequence @xmath6 which is a fixed point under @xmath7 with legal seed @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding hull @xmath9 is obtained as the closure of the two - sided shift orbit of @xmath10 in the product topology .",
    "before we comment on the spectral structure , let us identify some relevant factors .    upon identifying letters with their barred copies ,",
    "one obtains the _ quaternary _ rudin - shapiro substitution @xcite @xmath11 with induced fixed point @xmath12 of @xmath13 , with legal seed @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to the classic _ binary _ rudin - shapiro chain via the map @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for complexity results ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hulls fail to be palindromic @xcite , which has interesting consequences for the spectral theory of associated schrdinger operators . for further results on palindromic systems ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the binary and the quaternary rudin - shapiro hulls are _ mutually locally derivable _",
    "( mld ) ; see @xcite and references therein for the concept . in the symbolic setting , mld just means that there are sliding block maps with local support @xcite in both directions of the derivation .",
    "the non - trivial direction of this claim follows from the observation that @xmath17 is the longest @xmath18-free subword of the binary image and has the unique preimage @xmath19 under @xmath14 .",
    "this determines the two cosets of @xmath20 modulo @xmath21 that are occupied by the letters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "due to repetitivity , the subword @xmath17 occurs with bounded gaps , wherefore this defines a _ local _ derivation rule .",
    "consequently , both define dynamical systems with the same spectrum , which is known to comprise the pure point part @xmath24 $ ] and an absolutely continuous component , the latter being lebesgue measure with multiplicity @xmath21 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "let us go one step back , and define a sliding block map on @xmath25 that is induced by @xmath26 its action on @xmath25 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 . this way",
    ", one induces the primitive substitution @xmath29 which shows a toeplitz structure ( see below ) that is somewhat similar to that of the paper folding substitution ; compare @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 be the fixed point of @xmath31 with legal seed @xmath32 , which is the image of @xmath12 under the sliding block map induced by @xmath33 .",
    "this bi - infinite word leads to a partition of @xmath3 into four subsets @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the fixed point property then results in the equations @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 was used to simplify the relations . due to the decoupling",
    ", one can calculate the solutions via iteration , which gives @xmath39 note that the singleton set @xmath40 has to be added to @xmath41 because it is not contained in any of the lattice cosets ( although it is in the @xmath21-adic closure of either of the four unions ) .",
    "the only other fixed point of @xmath31 differs from @xmath30 precisely in @xmath42 .",
    "it can thus be described by moving the singleton set @xmath40 from @xmath41 to @xmath43 .",
    "our explicit coordinatization is a result of a coincidence in the sense of dekking @xcite .",
    "it implies that @xmath44 defines a dynamical system with pure point dynamical spectrum , which is @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the latter coincides with the pure point part of the spectrum of the rudin - shapiro system .",
    "this also follows from standard results ; compare @xcite and references therein .",
    "returning to the original substitution @xmath46 of eq .   and",
    "mapping all ordinary letters to @xmath18 and all barred ones to @xmath47 , one induces the thue - morse ( or pruhet - thue - morse ) substitution @xmath48 formulated on the alphabet @xmath49 ; compare @xcite for background .",
    "our original fixed point @xmath10 is mapped to @xmath50 with legal seed @xmath51 .",
    "the dynamical spectrum of the corresponding hull @xmath52 under the shift action comprises a pure point part ( namely @xmath45 $ ] ) and a singular continuous one , the latter leading to an explicit representation as a riesz product @xcite .",

    "a coordinatization of @xmath59 via a partition of @xmath3 can be done in a similar way as discussed above for @xmath60 ; compare @xcite . via the corresponding diffraction measure",
    ", this provides an alternative way to show that @xmath45 $ ] is the dynamical spectrum of the associated dynamical system .",
    "it exhausts the pure point part of the dynamical spectrum of the thue - morse system .    having analyzed these ( selected ) factors of our original substitution @xmath46",
    ", we can conclude that the latter has mixed spectrum with all three spectral types being present .",
    "the maximal equicontinuous ( or kronecker ) factor is the dyadic solenoid @xmath61 , which also emerges via the ` torus parametrization ' of the period doubling chain or the maximal model set factor of the rudin - shapiro chain .",
    "let us explain this type of connection in a little more detail .",
    "the thue - morse dynamical system has a dynamical spectrum of mixed type , with pure point and singular continuous components . as was pointed out in @xcite , the diffraction spectrum only detects part of it .",
    "in fact , it only shows the trivial part of the pure point spectrum , @xmath20 , while the rest is missing ( or hidden ) .",
    "however , the period doubling system is a factor that is pure point , with dynamical spectrum @xmath24 $ ] , so that the diffraction of thue - morse together with that of period doubling covers the entire dynamical spectrum of thue - morse .",
    "in fact , the period doubling system is a factor that lies between thue - morse and its kronecker factor , the latter being the dyadic solenoid @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this happens to be the ` torus ' for the period doubling system in the language of model sets @xcite , and the mapping from period doubling to the solenoid is 1-to-1 almost everywhere @xcite .    the system of close - packed dimers on the line @xcite provides an example where the dynamical spectrum has pure point and absolutely continuous components , as does rudin - shapiro . in both cases ,",
    "the dynamical spectrum is richer , but the ` missing ' parts again can be recovered from the analysis of a single factor .",
    "a similar situation shows up in many other examples , though not in all .",
    "still , it is worth looking at this relation in some more detail .",
    "a natural generalization of the thue - morse substitution , in the spirit of @xcite , is @xmath62 with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the classic tm substitution .",
    "the substitution matrix reads @xmath65 , with eigenvalues @xmath66 .",
    "this two - parameter family of constant length substitutions shares many properties with its classic ancestor ; see @xcite for a detailed analysis . in particular , there is a sliding block map that works for the entire family , and induces a maximal model set factor of substitution type .",
    "the latter is a generalization of the period doubling substitution , namely @xmath67 with the finite word @xmath68 .",
    "this is a constant length substitution with a coincidence in the sense of dekking @xcite , and hence a model set @xcite .",
    "this factor then has a torus parametrization @xcite which is an almost everywhere 1-to-1 map onto a one - dimensional dyadic solenoid , which we denote by @xmath61 as before .",
    "let us now discuss some two - dimensional examples , which are considerably more complex .",
    "the _ squiral tiling _ appears in ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "10.1.4 ) , where it was constructed as a simple example for a tiling of the plane by one prototile ( and its mirror image ) with infinitely many edges",
    ". it is obtained from the primitive inflation rule @xmath69{squiralinfl.eps}}\\ ] ] which has the ( linear ) integer inflation factor @xmath70 .",
    "when one distinguishes the two chiralities , it is obvious that the ( colored ) tiling is equivalent ( in the sense of mutual local derivability @xcite ) to a coloring of the square lattice that emerges from the block substitution @xmath71{sqblockinfl.eps}}\\ ] ] this block substitution is bijective and of constant length in the terminology of @xcite . in this formulation , it was analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "a larger patch is shown in figure  [ fig : blocktil ] .",
    "it follows from standard arguments @xcite that the dynamical spectrum of the squiral contains @xmath72\\times{\\mathbb{z}}[\\frac{1}{3}]$ ] as its pure point part .",
    "moreover , the analysis of @xcite shows that the remaining part of the spectrum is purely singular continuous .",
    "the corresponding diffraction measure is explicitly known , and can be represented as a two - dimensional riesz product .     a square - shaped patch of the squiral tiling with full @xmath73-symmetry , as obtained from the block substitution . for this figure , the reference point of the prototiles",
    "is placed in their centers , so that the patch is the central part of a fixed point under the corresponding block substitution.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    as the tiling is bijective @xcite , the block substitution ( [ eq : blocksub ] ) commutes with the exchange of the two colors .",
    "this implies that the hull of the squiral is also invariant under the exchange of the colors : with every tiling in the hull , also the tiling with inverted colors is in the hull .",
    "this is the deeper reason why the projection onto the underlying two - dimensional @xmath70-adic solenoid @xmath74 is at least 2-to-1 , so that the ( dynamical or diffraction ) spectrum can not be pure point . in particular , the squiral tiling can not originate from a model set .",
    "our next step therefore is to find a factor in which pairs of tilings with inverted colors are identified .",
    "this is achieved with a sliding block map , which maps @xmath75-blocks of tiles to some new symbols .",
    "the squiral tiling admits 14 distinct legal @xmath75-patterns , as only the two blocks with four equal symbols are not allowed . in the following block map ( in which we write the two colors as @xmath18 and @xmath76 )",
    ", pairs of blocks with inverted colors are identified , but nothing else , @xmath77\\mapsto a,\\quad \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\bar{1 } \\end{matrix}\\right]\\mapsto b,\\quad \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & \\bar{1 } \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}\\right]\\mapsto c,\\quad \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } \\bar{1 } & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}\\right]\\mapsto d,\\\\ \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & 1 \\\\ \\bar{1 } & \\bar{1 } \\end{matrix } \\right]\\mapsto e,\\quad \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & \\bar{1 } \\\\ 1 & \\bar{1 } \\end{matrix } \\right]\\mapsto f,\\quad \\pm\\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & \\bar{1 } \\\\",
    "\\bar{1 } & 1 \\end{matrix } \\right]\\mapsto g. \\end{gathered } \\label{eq : blockmap}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that any tiling in the image lifts to exactly two squiral tilings .",
    "there is one position where we can chose whether the lift has a @xmath18 or a @xmath78 there ; all other tiles in the lift are then determined .",
    "our factor map is therefore uniformly 2-to-1 on the entire hull of all squiral tilings .",
    "this is completely analogous to the hull of the ( generalized ) thue - morse chains from above , which project uniformly 2-to-1 to the hull of the ( generalized ) period doubling chains , under a similar sliding block map @xcite .",
    "the block map ( [ eq : blockmap ] ) induces a primitive substitution on the tilings in the factor space , @xmath79,\\quad b\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } f&f&b \\\\ d&c&g \\\\",

    "they contain lattice - periodic subsets , which implies that they are model sets @xcite .",
    "as such , they necessarily have pure point dynamical and diffraction spectra ; compare @xcite . in turn , the squiral tilings , whose hull is a 2-to-1 cover of a pure point factor , can not have pure point spectrum .",
    "in fact , with suitable scattering strengths ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 on the two symbols ) , their diffraction spectrum is purely singular continuous @xcite .",
    "the tilings generated by the substitution ( [ eq : factorsubst ] ) form the maximal model set factor of the squiral tiling , which we henceforth call @xmath82 .",
    "this factor , in turn , has a two - dimensional , @xmath70-adic solenoid @xmath83 as factor , onto which it projects 1-to-1 almost everywhere via the torus parametrization of general model sets @xcite .",
    "we shall now analyze in more detail the set of tilings where this projection fails to be 1-to-1 .    for this purpose , we note that the level-@xmath84 supertiles of the substitution ( [ eq : factorsubst ] ) have the following block structure @xmath85,\\quad b\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } f & b \\\\ x & g^t \\end{matrix}\\right],\\quad c\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } f & c \\\\ x & e^t \\end{matrix}\\right],\\quad d\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } g & d \\\\ x & e^t \\end{matrix}\\right],\\\\ e\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } g & e \\\\ x & e^t \\end{matrix}\\right],\\quad f\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } f & f \\\\ x & g^t \\end{matrix}\\right],\\quad g\\mapsto\\left[\\begin{matrix } g & g \\\\ x & g^t \\end{matrix}\\right ] , \\end{gathered } \\label{eq : supertiles}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a square block of dimension @xmath87 ( which is the same for all seven symbols ) , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are rows with entries @xmath90 and @xmath91 , while @xmath92 and @xmath93 are columns with entries @xmath94 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "we can now arrange two supertiles such that the separating line between them passes near the origin .",
