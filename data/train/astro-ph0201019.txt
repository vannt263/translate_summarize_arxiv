    "through a close interplay between theory and observation , a `` standard '' picture for the formation of isolated , low - mass stars has emerged ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) . at the heart of this picture",
    "lie the so - called `` dense cores '' , studied extensively by myers and coworkers ( e.g. , myers 1999 ) .",
    "these dense cores are intimately associated with star formation , with roughly half of them already harboring infrared sources ( beichman et al .",
    "1986 ) . the other half are termed `` starless cores '' , and they are the focus of our investigation .",
    "the starless cores are thought to be condensed out of strongly magnetized , turbulent background clouds .",
    "direct zeeman measurements to date , as compiled by crutcher ( 1999 ) , suggest that the field strength is close to the critical value required for the molecular cloud support , after likely geometric corrections ( shu et al",
    "core formation can be driven by either turbulence decay ( myers 1999 ) or ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we shall focus on the latter , which has been studied quantitatively by many authors ( e.g. , nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ; basu & mouschovias 1994 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "a general conclusion is that dense cores are formed on a time scale several times the free fall time of the background .",
    "this relatively long formation time should leave a strong imprint on the chemistry of the cores .",
    "the goal of our investigation is to predict the spatial distributions of various molecular species at different stages of cloud evolution . for this initial study ,",
    "we will concentrate on co , cs , ccs , nh@xmath2 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 , which are often used to probe the physical conditions of star - forming clouds .",
    "we take into account the feedback of chemistry on the cloud dynamics , through ion abundances , which regulate the ambipolar diffusion and thus cloud contraction rate . through a detailed comparison of the predicted and observed chemical abundances of starless cores , we seek to provide further support for the standard picture of isolated star formation involving ambipolar diffusion .",
    "a starless core well suited for such a purpose is the dense core of l1544 , for which an extensive data set is becoming available ( e.g. , caselli et al . 2001a , b ) .",
    "the l1544 starless core is located in the eastern part of the taurus molecular cloud complex , at an estimated distance of 140 pc ( elias 1978 ) .",
    "it is an elongated core that shows substantial infall motions ( up to @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) on both large ( @xmath3 pc ) and small ( @xmath5 pc ) scales , based on single - disk observations of co , @xmath6co , c@xmath7o , cs , c@xmath8s , hco@xmath1 , and n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( tafalla et al . 1998 ) and interferometric observations of n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( williams et al .",
    "interferometric observations of ccs by ohashi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reveal a ring - like structure , which shows evidence for collapse as well as rotation .",
    "the low central emission is most likely due to a depletion of ccs , judging from the fact that dust continuum peaks inside the ring ( ward - thompson , motte & andre 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , the column density distribution of the l1544 core is rather well determined , not only from the dust continuum emission , but also from absorption against a mid - infrared background ( bacmann et al .",
    "the core has a small , high column ( and volume ) density central plateau ( of radius @xmath9 au ) , surrounded by an envelope in which the column ( and volume ) density decreases rapidly outward , before it joins rather abruptly with the background at a radius of order @xmath10 au ( bacmann et al .",
    "the plateau - envelope structure has been interpreted in terms of the ambipolar diffusion - driven dynamical evolution of a magnetized cloud ( li 1999 ; ciolek & basu 2000 ) , and the large column density contrast between the central plateau and the background ( @xmath11 ; bacmann et al .",
    "2000 ) suggests that the l1544 core is rather evolved ( williams et al .",
    "1999 ) , and may be on the verge of forming a star ( or stellar system ) .",
    "further evidence for the core being in an advanced stage of evolution comes from iram 30 m observations of caselli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found that co is depleted by a factor of order @xmath12 at the dust continuum peak .",
    "these authors also noted that the ( likely ) optically thin lines of d@xmath6co@xmath1 and hc@xmath7o@xmath1 are double - peaked , which may be another indication that these species are centrally depleted and their emission comes mainly from an infalling _ shell_. the wealth of molecular line and dust continuum data , coupled with the recent zeeman measurement of magnetic field strength ( crutcher & troland 2000 ) and the determination of magnetic field direction from submillimeter polarization measurements ( ward - thompson et al . 2000 ) , makes l1544 a rosette stone for theories of dense core condensation leading to isolated low - mass star formation .",
    "many of the dynamical and chemical features of l1544 are shared by l1498 , another quiescent , elongated starless core also located in the taurus molecular complex .",
    "lemme et al .",
    "( 1995 ) studied the core in detail , and found that the distributions of both c@xmath7o and cs are ring - like , indicating a central depletion of these two species .",
    "the co depletion factor is inferred to be of order @xmath13 or higher ( willacy , langer & velusamy 1998 ) , comparable to that of l1544 , based on isophot 100 and 200 @xmath14 m observations .",
    "single - dish and interferometric observations of ccs ( kuiper , langer & velusamy 1996 ) show that its distribution is also ring - like .",
    "moreover , the nh@xmath2 emission appears to be centrally peaked , again similar to l1544 . perhaps most strikingly , there is evidence for infall motions on a large ( @xmath15 pc ) scale in the double - peaked profiles of both optically thick cs lines and the likely optically thin c@xmath8s(2 - 1 ) transition ( lemme et al . 1995 ) ; the latter could come from an infalling shell , as in l1544 ( caselli et al .",
    "the optically thin tracer n@xmath0h@xmath1 shows , however , a single peaked spectrum ( lee , myers & tafalla 2001 ) , indicating that it is centrally peaked , in contrast to c@xmath8s .",
    "these similarities to l1544 point to a relatively advanced stage of pre - protostellar evolution for l1498 , making it another valuable testing ground for chemical and dynamical models of ( low - mass ) star formation .",
    "common to both sources is the ring ( or shell)-like structure of ccs , a well - known `` early time '' species ( bergin & langer 1997 ) tracing chemically `` young '' material of order @xmath16 yrs or less .",
    "this prominent feature should provide a strong constraint on models .",
    "additional constraints should come from the inferred large co depletion near the core center as well as the spatial extent and speed of the infall motions present in both l1544 and l1498 .",
    "the question we want to address is : can the standard picture of dense core formation involving ambipolar diffusion satisfy these chemical _ and _ kinematic constraints simultaneously ?",
    "a partial answer to this question has been provided by bergin & langer ( 1997 ) , who considered the chemical evolution of _ a parcel _ of cloud material whose density increases with time in a prescribed way ( i.e. , a standard time dependent but depth independent model ) .",
    "they found that differential depletion of various molecular species onto dust grains must be a key ingredient in understanding the differentiated chemical structure observed in l1498 .",
    "aikawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) went one step further , and followed the evolution of molecular abundances of a dynamically collapsing starless core _ as a whole _",
    ", with an emphasis on the spatial distribution .",
    "the study was based on the self - similar solution of larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) and its artificially delayed analogs . among the dynamical models adopted",
    ", they found that the undelayed larson - penston model provides the best overall fit to the observational data on co , ccs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 for l1544",
    ". if this result is robust , its implications would be far reaching .",
    "it is well known that the larson - penston solution describes the collapse of a cloud essentially on a free - fall time scale .",
    "the fact that it matches observations better than its delayed analogs appears to pose a serious challenge to the standard picture of star formation involving strongly magnetized cloud cores , which are formed through ambipolar diffusion on a time scale much longer than the free - fall time scale .",
    "however , the large infall velocity of the larson - penston solution , approaching 3.3 times the sound speed , is clearly incompatible with those inferred for l1544 and other starless cores , which are typically less than the sound speed ( lee et al .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit model of aikawa et al . under predicts the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 by a large factor of @xmath11 .",
    "these discrepancies motivate us to reexamine the molecular evolution of starless cores using a more sophisticated dynamical model , one that is coupled to the cloud chemistry .",
    "the dynamical model we will adopt is that of li ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is a spherical model of starless cores that takes into account the dynamic effects of magnetic field approximately . as envisioned in standard scenario of low - mass star formation",
    ", the cores in the model evolve through ambipolar diffusion , and their dynamics are coupled to chemistry through the abundances of charged species .",
    "previously , we ( shematovich , shustov , & wiebe 1997 ; 1999 ) have modeled the chemistry of dynamically evolving clouds in detail .",
    "the chemical model will be combined with the dynamical model into a coupled dynamical - chemical model of magnetized starless cores .",
    "an advantage of the combined model is that it allows for a determination of not only the time evolution of various molecular species but also their _ spatial _ distributions _ and _ kinematics .",
    "we describe the formulation of the combined model in  [ review ] . in ",
    "[ result ] , we present representative model results , focusing on the density distribution , velocity field and abundance distributions of several commonly used molecular species .",
    "these results are compared with observations of l1544 .",
    "we conclude and discuss our main results and future refinements in  [ discuss ] .",
    "ambipolar diffusion - driven evolution of strongly magnetized clouds has been modeled by many authors , although a complete understanding is still lacking .",
    "the numerical complexity of the problem forced most workers to adopt either a quasi - static approximation ( e.g. , nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ) or a simplified disk - like geometry ( e.g. , basu & mouschovias 1994 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "some 2d axisymmetric dynamical models are available ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ; desch & mouschovias 2001 ) , although incorporation of a full - blown chemical network into such models would be prohibitively expensive computationally at present .",
    "a simpler approach to the dynamical problem was pioneered by safier , mckee & stahler ( 1997 ) . by retaining only the pressure component of the magnetic forces they were able to retain a spherical geometry , which simplifies the dynamics greatly .",
    "indeed , they were able to obtain _ analytic _ solutions to both core formation and collapse assuming further that the thermal pressure is negligible and that the ions ( and magnetic field lines tied to them ) move much more slowly than neutrals .",
    "these last two assumptions have been relaxed in li ( 1998 ) and the resulting set of governing equations can be solved efficiently , particularly in a lagrangian form ( li 1999 ) .",
    "the formulation of the dynamical problem by li ( 1999 ) is employed in our coupled dynamical - chemical model .    for reference",
    ", we list below the equations governing the dynamic evolution of a spherical , magnetized cloud ( taken from li 1999 ) in dimensionless radius @xmath17 , mass @xmath18 , density @xmath19 , velocity @xmath20 , magnetic field strength @xmath21 and time @xmath22 : @xmath23",

    "there are two dimensionless quantities in the governing equations .",
    "the first , @xmath39 , is the ratio of magnetic pressure to thermal pressure at the cloud center at @xmath40 . for simplicity",
    ", it will be taken to be unity , consistent with the current data on the magnetic fields in the interstellar clouds ( crutcher 1999 ) .",

    "an approximate value for the drag coefficient of @xmath45  @xmath46  g@xmath4  s@xmath4 is given in shu ( 1992 ) , obtained assuming a mean molecular weight of ions of @xmath47 .",
    "we will adopt the above simple prescription for the coupling parameter in this initial study , although a more elaborate treatment taking into account of contributions from charged dust grains is possible ( e.g. , nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 ; li 1999 ) and will be implemented in the future .      the chemical model used here has been described in detail by shematovich et al .",

    "the computed abundances are then used to determine the magnetic coupling parameter @xmath41 , and to obtain column densities for various commonly used molecular tracers for comparison with observations .",
    "we consider gas - phase reactions in the dense , dark regions of molecular clouds that are well shielded from the external uv radiation field .",

    "@xmath49 ( see table  3 ) . only a small fraction ( @xmath101 ) of that time is spent at densities above @xmath10  @xmath49 . that a cloud spends a relatively short time ( a few times the free - fall time ) at high densities after forming a magnetically supercritical core is a general feature of ambipolar diffusion - driven evolution .",
    "it helps to keep the ccs abundance higher than one would expect based on the total time of cloud evolution .",
    "the fractional abundances of ccs are shown in fig .",
    "6 as a function of radius for both the magnetic and non - magnetic models .",
    "note the `` humps '' on the distributions of ccs abundance in the magnetic model , which are not apparent in the non - magnetic model .",
    "the exact origin of the humps is unclear .",
    "we suspect that they are related to the depletion of co in the central high density region , similar to the `` depletion '' peak proposed by ruffle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for hc@xmath2n .",
    "ruffle et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) showed that c@xmath0h and hc@xmath2n in dense , cold cores are characterized by a secondary `` late - time '' maximum in their fractional abundances .",
    "the second peak is thought to be mainly caused by the increased depletion of co , which allows c@xmath1 ion to react more readily with h@xmath0 than with oxygen bearing species .",
    "the net result is an increase in the rates of production of ch and other carbon - bearing molecules ( without oxygen ) .",
    "it was found that high late - time c@xmath0h and hc@xmath2n maxima are achieved only when the freeze - out time scale is long compared to the chemical time scale . because c@xmath0h and other ( neutral and ionized ) late - time hydrocarbons are the precursors of ccs formation in the reactions with neutral and ionized sulfur through @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 ccs should behave in a way similar to the c@xmath0h and hc@xmath2n .",
    "the competition between depletion and late - time hydrocarbon chemistry enhanced by co - depletion appears to be the most likely cause of the humps on the radial profiles of ccs abundance .    in any case , the humps have apparently kept the ccs abundance of the magnetic model close to , and in some regions exceeding , that of the non - magnetic model .",
    "they are largely responsible for the higher - than - expected value of the ccs column density in the magnetic model .",
    "in addition , the decline of ccs abundance outside the hump , coupled with a steep decrease in the hydrogen number density with radius , may explain the observed rapid decline of the ccs column density outside the ring ( ohashi 2001 ; priv .",
    "comm . ) .        in the standard model , co",
    "is heavily depleted in the central high density region .",
    "the depletion is most clearly seen in the first panel of fig .  7 , where the fractional abundance is plotted as a function of radius .",
    "the abundance is significantly below the canonical value of @xmath105 inside a radius of @xmath106  au , by a factor up to @xmath47 .",
    "the size of the depletion region is roughly consistent with that deduced by caselli et al .",
    "( 2001b ; their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the depletion is less evident in the co column density distribution ( see fig .  4 ) , which is flat near the center .",
    "the ratio of co and hydrogen in peak column density is a factor of @xmath107 below the canonical value .",
    "this depletion factor is about half of the value ( @xmath108 ) inferred by caselli et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "their inference is based on the observations of c@xmath109o , c@xmath7o , and dust emission ( ward - thompson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , an dust opacity of 0.005  @xmath110g@xmath4 was adopted to convert the dust continuum flux into a hydrogen column density . at densities as high as @xmath111  @xmath49 , an opacity of @xmath5  @xmath110g@xmath4 may be more appropriate ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , which would lower the estimate of the hydrogen column density by half and bring a closer agreement between the model prediction and observation .",
    "alternatively , a flattened geometry , as observed for l1544 , and/or a somewhat higher co adsorption energy ( see aikawa et al . 2001 ) may enhance the co depletion in the column density distribution .",
    "besides co , there are other species that are strongly depleted in the high density central region .",
    "these include cs , ccs and to a lesser extent hco@xmath1 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "7 . the nitrogen bearing species , n@xmath0h@xmath1 and nh@xmath2 , are on the other hand hardly depleted ; if anything , their abundances are slightly enhanced near the center .",
    "this differential depletion pattern is in agreement with previous findings ( e.g. , bergin & langer 1997 ; aikawa et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it may have profound effects on the molecular line profiles used to probe cloud kinematics .",
    "an interesting observational fact about l1544 is that some optically thin lines in l1544 , such as ccs ( ohashi et al .",
    "1999 ) and hc@xmath7o@xmath1 ( caselli et al .",
    "2001b ) , are double - peaked .",
    "as noted by caselli et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001b ) , the double - peaked optically thin lines can be explained in a collapsing cloud _ provided _ that the line - emitting molecules are strongly depleted near the center .",
    "we have seen from fig .  7 that ccs and , to a lesser extent , hco@xmath1 ( and thus hc@xmath7o@xmath1 ) are indeed centrally depleted in our standard model .",
    "a unique strength of the coupled dynamical - chemical model is that it allows for a simultaneous determination of the spatial distribution of a given species and the velocity field , the two ingredients for line profile modeling . in a subsequent paper",
    ", we will produce synthetic line profiles for both optically thin and thick lines ( such as cs and hco@xmath1 ; tafalla et al .",
    "1998 ) , which should enable us to constrain the models of core formation leading to star formation using both the spatial _ and _ kinematic information of molecular species .",
    "we have developed a coupled dynamical and chemical model for the starless cores of strongly magnetized molecular clouds .",
    "the coupling is achieved through ions , the abundances of which are determined self - consistently from a chemical network .",
    "the ionic abundances control the time scale of cloud dynamic evolution via ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we have concentrated on a representative model in which an isolated magnetic cloud increases its central number density by a factor of @xmath112 to @xmath113  @xmath49 in 5.69 million years , with an eye on explaining the observational data on the chemical abundances of the well - studied starless core l1544 .",
    "we find that the predicted peak values of co , ccs , n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 column densities are within a factor of two or so of those inferred for l1544 from observations .",
    "the spatial distributions of these species are also consistent with those observed .",
    "an alternative , non - magnetic model was also considered for comparison . with the same initial conditions as in the magnetic model , the non - magnetic cloud collapses promptly , reaching the observed state in merely 1.56 million years .",
    "it produces a worse overall fit to the available data on l1544 .",
    "in particular , the column density distribution of ccs predicted by the model is centrally peaked , which is not observed .",
    "we conclude that our initial results of modeling lend some support to the standard picture of dense core formation out of strongly magnetized molecular clouds involving ambipolar diffusion over several dynamic times .",
    "there are , however , a number of uncertainties to which the results may be sensitive to , including the sticking probability and adsorption energies for various species . a parameter survey is needed to firm up the conclusion",
    "there are several aspects of the coupled model that we wish to improve upon in the future .",
    "these include both dynamics and chemistry .",
    "even though our spherical model captures the essence of the ambipolar diffusion - driven cloud evolution , the effects of magnetic tension ( which tend to flatten a cloud ) can not be treated .",
    "indeed , the opposite extreme , a disk - like geometry , may describe the observed elongated mass distribution in l1544 better .",
    "it should be straightforward to extend the model to this geometry , which would allow for the inclusion of rotation whose presence has been inferred for l1544 by ohashi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on ccs data . on the chemistry side , a major uncertainty is the adsorption energies for co and other species .",
    "different sets of adsorption energies have been considered by aikawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and a similar parameter study is needed for our model . also uncertain are the probability of molecules sticking onto dust grains and grain surface processes , and an exploration of different cases is desirable .",
    "another area of improvement would be the treatment of magnetic coupling coefficient , by including the effects of charged dust grains ( especially small ones ) and external uv radiation field .",
