    "3 , overall , the upper band shifts downward but the lower band shifts upward . this change stems from the mixing of the states of two bands under the impurity scatterings .",
    "the functions @xmath122 reveal how the current vertex is modified by the impurity scatterings . for the bare current vertex only @xmath123 is finite . from fig .",

    "the features of @xmath100 and @xmath0 may be qualitatively explained by analyzing the behavior of @xmath4 as function of @xmath114 .",
    "recall @xmath138.@xcite @xmath139 is actually the functional of the green function @xmath140 and the impurity potential @xmath141 , both of latter two depending on @xmath114 or the chemical potential @xmath32 .",
    "if the @xmath114 dependence of @xmath141 is neglected , then one gets @xmath100 from @xmath142 .",
    "based on such a consideration , it has been illustrated in ref .",
    "that the calculated @xmath0 from the experimental results for @xmath4 is in overall agreement with experiment .",
    "theoretically , at large carrier concentration , the system can be approximately described by the one band green function , e.g. , @xmath143 for electron doping .",
    "this is equivalent to the boltzmann treatment to @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the boltzmann theory gives rise to a linear behavior of @xmath4 down to very low @xmath114 close to 0 . by the present formalism",
    ", however , there exists coherence between the states of upper and lower bands@xcite at very low doping because the single particle energy levels are broadened under the impurity scatterings .",
    "the coherence is taken into account through the green functions @xmath144 in the present formalism . at @xmath145 ,",
    "the coherence may be considered as setting in .",
    "as @xmath114 further decreases , the fermi level gets close to the lower band and the coherence effect becomes significant . as a result , there is the minimum electric conductivity at @xmath146 .",
    "as seen from the inset in fig .6 , @xmath4 decreases slower as @xmath147 being closer to zero , resulting in the rapid decreasing of @xmath100 .",
    "the unusual behavior of @xmath0 at low doping comes from the combination of @xmath4 and @xmath100 and can be understood as the coherence effect between the upper and lower dirac bands .",

    ", there is no screening to the charged impurities by the model .",
    "this is unphysical . in a real system",
    ", there must exist extra opposite charges screening the charged impurities .",
    "this screening can be neglected only when above certain doping level the screening length by the carriers is shorter than that of the extra charges .",
    "close to @xmath146 , the extra screening could be taken into account in a more satisfactory model . by the present model",
    ", we can not perform numerical calculation at @xmath146 because of the coulomb divergence of @xmath19 at @xmath148 .",
