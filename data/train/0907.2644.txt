    "the central kiloparsec region of many nearby luminous infra - red galaxies ( lirgs ) shows a distribution of their radio emission consisting of a compact ( @xmath9 150 pc ) , high surface brightness , central radio source immersed in a low surface brightness circumnuclear halo ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) . while the compact , centrally located radio emission in these galaxies might be generated by a point - like source ( agn ) , or by the combined effect of multiple rsne and supernova remnants ( snrs ) , e.g. , the evolved nuclear starburst in arp  220 ( parra et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and m  82 ( e.g. muxlow et al . 1994 ) , it seems now well established that in the circumnuclear regions of those objects there is an ongoing burst of star formation producing core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne , type ib / c and type ii sne ) at a high rate ( e.g. ngc 7469 , colina et al .",

    "1998 ) , the detection of ccsne can be used to characterize the most important parameter in starbursts , namely the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "however , the estimation of the ccsn rate in lirgs is a challenging task , as the optical emission of supernovae is hampered by background brightness and by large amounts of dust in the nuclear starburst environment , and therefore those sne remain undiscovered by optical searches .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to directly probe the recent star forming activity in lirgs by means of high - resolution , high - sensitivity radio searches for ccsne , since these wavelengths do not suffer from dust obscuration , and can therefore set strong constraints on the properties of star formation in the dust - enshrouded environments encountered in lirgs .",
    "significant radio emission from ccsne is expected , as the interaction of the sn ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) gives rise to a high - energy density shell , which is rayleigh - taylor unstable and drives turbulent motions that amplify the existing magnetic field in the presupernova wind , and efficiently accelerate relativistic electrons , thus enhancing the emission of synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths ( chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "therefore , starburst activity in the circumnuclear regions of lirgs ensures both the presence of a high number of massive stars and a dense surrounding medium , so bright radio sne are expected to occur ( chevalier 1982 , chugai 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , radio and optical / ir observations have shown that highly - extinguished sne do exist in the circumnuclear ( @xmath101  kpc ) region of local lirgs ( e.g. , sn 2000 ft in ngc 7469 , colina et al .",

    "1990 , van dyk et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , trundle et al .",
    "we obtained the flux density of sn 2000 ft for each image in figure [ fig1 ] , after subtraction of the background emission , i.e. , the local , secular , non variable emission of the galaxy at 8.4 ghz .",
    "we estimated the local background radio emission in the region around sn 2000 ft by four different procedures : ( i ) we used the _ aips _ task imfit , solving for a zero level component ( the background ) for each observing epoch .",
    "this procedure yielded background values of 123 , 96 , 88 , 100 , and 99 microjy for the 2000 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , and 2006 epochs , respectively .",
    "the above background values were subtracted from the peak values estimated for sn 2000 ft , and are the values quoted in table  [ tab : vla - log ] .",
    "( ii ) we also determined the background emission at the position of the supernova as the difference in the flux density of two images , the first one obtained by using a purely naturally weighting scheme ( uvwtfn=na ; robust=5 ) , and the second one obtained by using a uniform weighting scheme ( uvwtfn=  ; robust=-5 ) , where in addition we dropped the inner 35 kilo-@xmath23 of the u - v range , essentially removing all extended emission from the data .",
    "the former image yields the lowest off - source r.m.s . in the images , and is most sensitive to the extended , secular background emission , while the second is essentially free of background emission , at the expense of having a higher off - source rms .",
    "the estimates for the secular background emission obtained in this way coincided with those obtained by following the first procedure within 2 @xmath13jy / b .",
    "as a measure of the uncertainty in the locally subtracted background emission we took the standard deviation of the above values ( 13@xmath13jy / b ) .",
    "we conservatively added this uncertainty linearly , rather than in quadrature , to the total uncertainty in the flux density measurements for sn 2000 ft , which are listed in table [ tab : vla - log ] and plotted in figure [ fig , lcurve ] .",
    "those values show that the late time radio emission of sn 2000 ft is well characterized by a single index for the power - law time decay , even six years after its explosion ( @xmath24 ; see sect .",
    "[ sec , lcurve ] for details ) .",
    "we note here that the flux density values reported in table [ tab : vla - log ] for sn 2000 ft are somewhat different from those presented in alberdi et al .",
    "their values were determined from images with different synthesized beams , used different weighting imaging schemes , applied amplitude selfcal after a few iterations of phase - selfcalibration , and used different field and cell sizes for each of the images presented in their paper . here , we followed a homogeneous data reduction scheme .",
    "specifically , we used the same field and cell sizes for all images , made a standard imaging scheme , using natural weighting and applying phase - selfcalibration only .",
    "the final run of imagr was done using a circular gaussian beam of size 0.31 arcsec for all epochs . finally , we took into account the subtraction of the background radio emission .",
    "all this explains the differences in the flux densities reported in those papers , but do not affect , or modify , any of the results or conclusions obtained in either paper .",
    "we show in figure [ fig , lcurve ] the flux density evolution of sn 2000 ft .",
    "the data plotted correspond to our new flux density estimates ( corrected for the galaxy background emission ) , as well as our late time ( @xmath25 days ) radio data at 8.4 ghz ( see table [ tab : vla - log ] ) , while data at other wavelengths are taken from alberdi et al .",
    "( note that since the data are other frequencies were obtained with merlin , which has a resolution of @xmath1840 mas at 5 ghz , the putative background radio emission was resolved out ) .",
    "following alberdi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we fitted the light curves in terms of the `` mini - shell '' model ( chevalier 1982 ) , including modifications by weiler et al .",
    "in particular , alberdi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that both internal opacity ( consisting of synchrotron self - absorption and mixed thermal free - free absorption / nonthermal absorption ) and clumpy opacity contributions were not required to fit the data .",
    "alberdi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) did find , however , that a distant foreground absorber was needed to account for the non - detection of sn 2000 ft at 1.6 ghz in any of the observing epochs , so we have also fitted for such an absorber .",
    "in addition , we also use the fact that sn 2000 ft has been recently detected at optical wavelengths on 13 may 2000 ( colina et al . 2007 ) , based on an analysis of hst archival data .",
    "we have fixed here the explosion date to 10 may 2000 , so as to make it compatible with the optical detection .",
    "therefore , we fitted our multi - wavelength observations using the following expression ( e.g. weiler et al .",
    "2002 ) :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the observed flux density , in mjy ; @xmath28 is the observing frequency , in units of 5 ghz ; @xmath29 is the time since the explosion date , in days ; and @xmath30 is the external optical depth , assumed to arise from purely thermal , ionized hydrogen that absorb with frequency dependence @xmath31 . in turn ,",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 correspond to the flux density ( @xmath35 ) and uniform optical depths ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) at 5 ghz , one day after the explosion , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 accounts for the time dependence of the optical depth for the local uniform media .",
    "our best fit is yielded by the following set of parameters : spectral index , @xmath39 ; power - law time decay , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 mjy ; @xmath42 ; adopted power - law time decay of the optical depth , @xmath43 ; foreground uniform optical depth @xmath44 ( most likely associated with an h ii region , as found by alberdi et al . 2006 ) , @xmath450.17 .",
    "rsn sn  2000 ft was extraordinarily bright , and therefore was easy to detect and confirm as such in our images .",
    "however , rsne ( rsne ) are on average intrinsically fainter than sn 2000 ft , and hence several rsne could have exploded since 1998 but gone unnoticed by simple visual inspection of our vla radio images of ngc 7469 , especially since there is a non - negligible amount ( @xmath46jy ) of secular , non - variable , galactic radio emission .",
    "we therefore reverted to the use of other methods that could hint to the explosion of dimmer supernovae during this period .",
    "in particular , for the purpose of searching for rsne fainter than sn 2000 ft , we used all of our seven vla - a observing epochs , including two epochs prior to the discovery of sn 2000 ft , and re - analyzed them in a similar , homogeneous manner , including editing , calibrating , and imaging the data following standard procedures within _",
    "we then used a slightly modified version ( see melinder et al .",
    "2008 ) of the optimal image subtraction ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) package isis 2.2 .",
    "the method matches the psf , intensities , and background of the better `` seeing '' image , to the aligned poorer `` seeing '' images from the different epochs before the subtraction .",
    "the method has been used successfully to detect supernovae within the highly obscured nuclear regions of luminous infrared and starburst galaxies in near - ir , e.g. the discovery of sn 2004ip ( mattila et al .",
    "however , to our knowledge this is the first time it is applied to search for supernovae in radio images .",
    "the radio nucleus of the host galaxy was selected as the image region to derive the convolution kernel .",
    "the epoch from 2004 was used as the reference frame .",
    "no significant effect on the image subtraction quality was found when changing the kernel basis function width parameters .",
    "flux measurements were performed on the subtracted images using iraf and gaia software packages . due to",
    "the incomplete ( u - v ) coverage and the use of the clean deconvolution algorithm , the noise pattern of the radio images is complex and the background is not smooth in the subtracted images and contains a large number of false positive and negative `` sources '' .",
    "therefore , to determine our sn detection threshold we measured the flux in 44 circular apertures around the nucleus in the subtracted images using an aperture of 60 pixels radius and a sky annulus with an inner and outer radius of 90 and 120 pixels , respectively ( the pixel size was of 0.008 arcsec ) .",
    "the standard deviation of these measured values was used as a @xmath47 limit , and corresponded to 20@xmath13jy / b .",
    "no additional transient sources besides sn 2000 ft above a @xmath48 detection threshold were apparent in the data set .",
    "we repeated the above procedure , taking each time a different reference epoch , but the results did not change : no additional rsne were detected .",
    "we also searched for intrinsic variability in regions r1 , r2 , r3 , and n. since regions r1 , r2 , and r3 are very bright and show spectral indices typical of star forming regions ( alberdi et al . 2006 ) , significant variability in their flux density well above statistical fluctuations must be due to an intrinsic variation caused by , most likely , a supernova .",
    "we therefore extracted the 8.4 ghz peaks of brightness from the sy 1 nucleus of the galaxy ( n ) , and from the star forming regions r1 , r2 , and r3 .",
    "those values are also listed in table [ tab : vla - log ] . however , given the uncertainties in the total flux density values of those regions , the variations are compatible with purely statistical fluctuations .",
    "hence , there is no evidence of significant variability that could point towards a supernova .",
    "the main goal of our vla observations was twofold .",
    "first , we aimed at monitoring the radio evolution of sn 2000 ft , especially at late times , and we discuss in detail this aspect in section [ discussion - late - time ] .",
    "second , we searched for recently exploded core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne , i.e. , type ib / c and type ii ) in the circumnuclear starburst of ngc  7469 , aimed at establishing its ccsn rate , independently of models . since we obtained in general very high - sensitivity ( off - source rms @xmath49jy / beam ) radio images of ngc 7469 at high - resolution ( fwhm@xmath190.30  ) , this could have permitted the discovery of new rsne in the eight years covered by our observations .",
    "we showed in section [ results ] that , apart from sn 2000 ft , there is no evidence for any other bright rsn in the ( circum)nuclear region of ngc 7469 since 1998 .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in terms of ccsn rates and starburst models in section [ ccsnrate ] .",
    "the new fit to the sn 2000 ft light curve ( see section [ sec , lcurve ] and figure [ fig , lcurve ] ) shows that the best fit parameters are somewhat different from those published in alberdi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , due to the addition of the new data at 8.4 ghz and also because the optical detection of sn 2000 ft on 13 may 2000 ( colina et al . 2007 ) implies that the explosion happened before , even if close to , the date of the optical detection . while the resulting fits do not change any of the facts described in alberdi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , one relevant parameter for the interaction of sn 2000 ft with its surroundings deserves particular attention : its mass - loss rate .    in the standard circumstellar interaction model for rsne , the synchrotron radio emission from the supernova is partially free - free absorbed by ionized gas outside the forward supernova shock front . in this scenario ,",
    "the supernova goes from an optically thick regime to an optically thin one when the peak optical depth equals @xmath50 ( this can be found by computing the time derivative in equation [ eq , fit ] ) . in our case , we have @xmath51(peak)=0.69 .",
    "this optical depth is attained in the radio regime at an age    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the mass - loss rate in units of @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the circumstellar temperature in units of @xmath56 k , @xmath57 is the supernova shock velocity in units of @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the presupernova wind velocity in units of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the observing frequency in units of 8.45 ghz .. since we are interested in the mass - loss rate , we can write the previous equation as follows :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the time to reach optical depth unity to free - free absorption at a given frequency , in units of 100 days .",
    "therefore , we can use our fitted light curves to directly measure the time at which sn 2000 ft reached @xmath64 , which corresponds to the emission peak at a given frequency .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath65 at @xmath19200 days and @xmath19300 days at 8.45 and 5.0 ghz , respectively .",
    "substituting those values in equation [ eq , mass - loss ] , we find that @xmath66 , typical of a red supergiant progenitor star , and where the inequality takes into account that , if synchrotron - self absorption plays some role around the observed peak of emission , then the obtained mass - loss rate is actually an upper limit .",
    "it has been proposed that ccsne exploding in dense environments , like those encountered in the circumnuclear regions of starburst galaxies , can result in very luminous rsne ( chevalier 1982 , chugai 1997 ) .",
    "an apparent confirmation of such a theory came from the discovery of the radio bright sn 2000 ft ( colina et al .",
    "2001a , b ) in the circumnuclear starburst ring ( @xmath18600 pc from the nucleus ) of ngc 7469 . however , the vla radio monitoring of sn 2000 ft for the first @xmath181100 days after its explosion showed that this rsn shared essentially the same properties that are common to radio sne identified as type ii sne ( weiler et al .",
    "2002 ) , despite having exploded in the dusty and very dense environment of the circumnuclear region of ngc 7469 .",
    "indeed , colina et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have recently identified the optical glow of sn 2000 ft using archival hst images taken on 13 may 2000 , and note that the supernova appears to have exploded in a region of increased local extinction ( @xmath184.2 magnitudes ) near the edge of a strong lane of dust surrounding the ring ( see their color map in figure 1 ) , which confirms that sn 2000 ft exploded in a dense and dusty surrounding medium .",
    "alberdi et al . ( 2006 ) also predicted that once the interaction of the ejecta of sn 2000 ft with the interstellar medium ( ism ) would become relevant , the flux density decay time scale for sn 2000 ft should be longer than for normal luminous rsne , whose radio emission continue to fall off very quickly",
    ". such change in the flux density decaying rate of the supernova would indicate the termination of the presupernova stellar wind , where the pressure of the ism is approximately equal to the ram pressure of the wind , and represents the passage of supernova to supernova remnant phase .",
    "this passage is actually expected to happen earlier for supernovae exploding in dense environments  as those encountered in starburst galaxies  than in the less dense environments of normal galaxies .",
    "in fact , the duration of the radio sn phase ( when the radio emission is governed by interaction between the ejecta and its circumstellar medium , csm ) is limited by the extent of the expanding presupernova wind , since the latter eventually reaches a radius where its ram pressure , @xmath67 , equals the external pressure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , @xmath68 ( chevalier & fransson 2001 ) . for a spherically symmetric",
    ", steady wind ( @xmath69 ) , this radius is    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the ism pressure in units of @xmath72 @xmath73 k , which is the estimated pressure for the central region of the starburst in m  82 ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) . once it has reached , a core - collapse supernova enters its supernova remnant ( snr ) phase , and its radio emission is no longer powered by the interaction with the csm , but rather with the ism . at this stage , the density encountered by the sn would be constant , which would result in a significant flattening of the radio emission , i.e. , a departure from the general , steep decline observed in the early times of the optically thin phase of sn 2000 ft .",
    "we followed up the radio evolution of sn 2000 ft using the vla at 8.4 ghz , searching for a potential departure of the flux density decaying rate , which would signal the passage of sn to snr phase for sn 2000 ft .",
    "our observations of the late time ( @xmath74 days ) evolution of the 8.4 ghz emission of sn 2000 ft ( see figure [ fig , lcurve ] ) do not show evidence for any departure from the general trend observed for the 8.4 ghz emission during its first 1000 days , and implies that the radio emission of sn 2000 ft is , after more than 2100 days , still being powered by the interaction of the supernova with the stellar wind of its progenitor star .",
    "it then follows that the external pressure of the ism is smaller than the ram pressure of the presupernova wind    @xmath75    the supernova shock has penetrated into the presupernova wind up to a distance @xmath76 cm ( @xmath77 pc ) after 2147 days of ( assumed ) free expansion at a constant velocity of 10000 .",
    "( we should notice here that the radius may be uncertain by as much as a factor of two , thus making @xmath68 uncertain by up to a factor of four . ) substituting this value , and our estimated mass - loss rate of @xmath78 for the progenitor star of sn 2000 ft in equation [ eq , p_ism ] , we then obtain that the ram pressure of the wind is @xmath79@xmath80 , still very high to be overcome by @xmath68",
    ". for comparison , @xmath81 in the central h  ii regions of m 82 , and drops below @xmath82 at a distance of 540 pc ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "we note here that parra et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have reported that some of the most long - lived remnants in arp 220 show a rather slow , or even unnoticeable flux density decay at 18 cm , as also found by rovilos et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and that this implies @xmath83 .",
    "we also note that if the environment where sn 2000 ft exploded had a similar , or significantly larger , pressure than that of the presupernova wind , we should have expected to see a significant flattening in the flux density time decay of sn 2000 ft , which is not observed .",
    "the number density of the thermal electrons in the stellar wind at a distance reached by the outer shock can be written as    @xmath84    where @xmath85 cm , and we have assumed solar abundances ( i.e. , the mean molecular weight of the plasma , @xmath86 ) . therefore , we obtain @xmath87 @xmath73 at an age of @xmath88 days .",
    "we stress here that the relevant physical parameter to determine whether the sn has started to enter its snr phase is not the particle density ratio ( @xmath89 ) , but the ratio of the ram pressure of the wind to that of the ism . indeed , as we have just shown",
    ", the thermal particle density in the preshocked wind can be similar to that encountered in the dusty , dense environments of lirgs , yet the radio emission from the supernova be powered by its interaction with the csm . since we have found that @xmath90 @xmath73k , one could have a rather dense ism ( @xmath91 ) at temperatures @xmath92 k , so that this gas would not be able to counterbalance the ram pressure of the progenitor wind at the current sn age . in this sense , although the conditions of the surrounding ism could be similar to those encountered in the central regions of m  82 , there is no significant impact on both the radio emission and expansion of sn 2000 ft , since the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is still larger than that of the ism . in order for the ism to affect noticeably the radio emission and expansion of the supernova , and assuming the above values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , sn 2000 ft will have to expand inside its surrounding ism up to a radius given by equation [ eq , csm - ism ] , which corresponds to @xmath95 cm (= 0.14 pc ) , which the supernova will attain at an age of about 13.6 yr . the sn is therefore expected to follow a similar trend to that observed for its first 5.9 years of expansion until that age , at which time it is expected that the sn radio emission will start to be dominated by its interaction with the ism , and a significant flattening of the flux should be observed .",
    "our late time radio monitoring of sn 2000 ft also allowed us to shed light on a number of relevant aspects for the supernova - csm interaction , such as the mass - loss history of the progenitor star and the swept - up mass by the supernova shock , @xmath96 .",
    "if we assume a free expansion for sn 2000 ft at an average speed of @xmath97  for the first @xmath2 days ( the last epoch of our observations at 8.4 ghz ) , and a standard wind velocity , @xmath98 , it follows that the 8.4 ghz emission is currently probing the wind of the progenitor star around @xmath99 5820 yr prior to its explosion .",
    "as found in the previous section , the csm density at the corresponding circumstellar wind was @xmath87 @xmath73 , which is in agreement with expectations for rsg supernova progenitors .",
    "the swept - up mass by the supernova shock is    @xmath100    where we have assumed a standard progenitor wind ( @xmath101 ) , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are the current shock radius of the supernova ( @xmath105 ) , the radius of the supernova at shock break - out , and the velocity of the stellar wind , respectively . since @xmath106 , then equation [ eq , msw ] can be rewritten as    @xmath107    where @xmath108 , and @xmath29 is the time since the sn explosion , in years .",
    "since we have @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath29=5.9 , the swept - up mass by the supernova shock of sn 2000 ft is then @xmath111 .",
    "the most relevant parameters of a starburst are its star formation rate ( @xmath112 ) and its core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) rate .",
    "the ccsn rate is especially relevant in the study of lirgs , since all these supernovae emit in radio ( albeit not all are so strong emitters that current radio interferometers despite their high sensitivity are able to detect all of them ) .",
    "it is also very important that the ( constant ) ccsn rate , , can be related to @xmath112 as follows :    @xmath113    where @xmath112 is the ( constant ) star formation rate in , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the lower and upper mass limits of the initial mass function ( imf , @xmath116 ) , and @xmath117 is the minimum mass of stars that yield supernovae , assumed to be 8 ( e.g. , smartt et al . 2009 ) . following the formalism described in colina & prez - olea ( 1992 ) , the observed far - infrared luminosity of a starburst , , can be used to constrain  and @xmath112 . for ngc 7469 , which has l@xmath12(8 - 1000@xmath13",
    "m ) = 4.5@xmath14 ( sanders et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we obtain a constant  @xmath118 0.75 sn / yr , and @xmath119 , assuming two thirds of the above ir luminosity are emitted by its associated circumnuclear starburst ( genzel et al .",
    "1995 ) , a salpeter imf ( @xmath120 ; salpeter 1955 ) for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and that all of the ionizing photons go into dust heating .",
    "if a fraction around 0.5 of all the photons go into dust heating , which is more realistic , then one obtains  @xmath16 1.5 sn / yr , and @xmath123 .",
    "those values are in broad agreement with values previously obtained by wilson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , colina & prez - olea ( 1992 ) , and genzel et al .",
    "1995 ) , and also with expectations for core - collapse supernova rates based solely in measured far infrared luminosities , e.g. , mattila & meikle ( 2001 ) , which found that  @xmath124(/)yr@xmath20 , thus implying a ccsn rate for the circumnuclear starburst of ngc 7469 of @xmath190.81 sn yr@xmath20 , for l@xmath125 .",
    "we showed in section [ results ] that our 8.4 ghz observations indicate the explosion of only one very bright rsn ( sn 2000 ft ; @xmath126 ) in the circumnuclear starburst of ngc 7469 during the period covered by our observations ( 7.8 years ) .",
    "this implies an upper limit for the average rate of very bright rsne of @xmath160.13 sn / yr , which appears to be far off from the estimated ( constant ) ccsn rate for ngc 7469 of @xmath19(0.811.50 ) sn yr@xmath20 , based on the fir emission from its circumnuclear starburst . to explain this disagreement ,",
    "it has been usually advocated that not all ccsne result in rsne .",
    "many ccsne would then go undetected because they will not emit any radio emission .",
    "however , this is a too simplistic view of ccsne .",
    "since it is the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material that surrounds ccsn progenitors which gives rise to their radio emission , there is no reason to think this physical scenario is not valid for all ccsne , all of which lose significant amounts of hydrogen - rich material in the last thousands of years of their lives through their stellar winds .",
    "therefore , all ccsne are expected to generate some level of radio emission , albeit not all of them will result in very bright radio emitters , which coupled with the limited sensitivity of currently available radio interferometers will prevent the detection of faint rsne .",
    "indeed , ccsne display a broad range of radio luminosities , spanning several orders of magnitude , with essentially all detected supernovae showing peak luminosities from a few times @xmath127  ( all of which would go undetected by our observations ) up to a few times @xmath128 , or more ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "5 of alberdi et al .",
    "2006 ) . if there was no background emission , rsne brighter than about three times the off - source rms ( rms=@xmath129 ) could have been directly detected by our vla - a observations . in practice , direct detections of rsne",
    "are limited by the background radio emission of the galaxy ( @xmath130jy ) , preventing us from detecting rsne with @xmath131 ) . very bright , long - lived rsne like sn 2000 ft are expected to come essentially from type iil / iin sne .",
    "smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have found that these represent @xmath186.5% of all ccsne ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , while type iip / iib sne -the radio faint ones , with peak luminosities of @xmath132- are much more numerous ( @xmath1864.1% ) .",
    "( type ib / c sne result often in bright radio events , but they fade away very quickly , typically in less than @xmath18100 days , so we do not take them into account , as chances of detecting them with our @xmath181.5 yr monitoring of ngc 7469 are meager . ) thus , whatever the ccsn rate , about 64.1% of the exploding sne are expected to become relatively radio faint .",
    "this would result in a rsn rate of @xmath133=(0.290.54 ) . since poisson statistics apply to the explosion of sne , based on a single rsn discovery we can not rule out that a starburst producing massive stars at a constant rate is taking place in ngc 7469 .",
    "another possible explanation within a constant star forming scenario for ngc 7469 is that the radio luminosity function of ccsne in ( u)lirgs is top - heavy , e.g. , if the imf results to be top - heavy , as suggested by , e.g. , klessen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in this scenario , we would be witnessing only the explosion of very massive stars , which yield also very bright radio emitters .",
    "we must note , however , that if the radio luminosity function of ccsne is bottom heavy ( e.g. , by mimicking a salpeter imf ) , then it is very unlikely that the only detected event in almost eight years would have been sn 2000 ft , since similarly bright rsne should have exploded during the 7.8 yrs covered by our vla observing program .",
    "finally , we note that while a starburst producing stars at a constant rate can not be excluded , _ hubble space telescope _ multi - wavelength ( uv through nir ) imaging and @xmath134-band ground - based long - slit spectroscopy of ngc 7469 ( daz - santos et al .",
    "2007 ) strongly suggest the existence of several localized starbursts in ngc 7469 , which started at different times and in different locations of its circumnuclear ring . according to the observations of daz - santos et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the starburst in ngc 7469 consists of many massive , young , compact clusters characterized by masses between ( 1@xmath2110)@xmath135  and ages of several millions up to several tens of million years , and sizes of parsecs , which yield support to an scenario where many instantaneous bursts occur with a spread in ages .",
    "sn 2000 ft in ngc 7469 belongs , together with sn 2004ip in iras 18293 - 3413 ( mattila et al .",
    "2007 , prez - torres et al . 2007 ) and sn 2008cs in iras 17138 - 1017 ( kankare et al . 2008a , prez - torres et al .",
    "2008 , kankare et al .",
    "2008b ) , to the class of ccsne that have been detected at both radio and optical / ir wavelengths in the nuclear regions of lirgs .",
    "all of them have in common that are subject to a substantial extinction , and show a high radio luminosity .",
    "a question arises : is this simply a selection effect ?",
    "the most luminous events at ir wavelengths are more easily detected by nir searches that we are currently undertaking .",
    "the high ir luminosity can be expected to be powered by an interaction with a dense csm , and the same scenario applies for high radio luminosity events .",
    "thus , significantly less luminous events would simply remain undetected by current vla observations .",
    "alternatively , it could be that such sne are favoured in the nuclear regions of lirgs , e.g. because of a top - heavy imf , or a high metallicity , resulting in large mass loss rates for the sn progenitor stars , and therefore in a dense csm . to get an unambiguous answer we need to keep searching for sne in lirgs at both ir and radio wavelengths so that we will have enough statistics in a few years from now .",
    "we have monitored the radio emission of the luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) ngc 7469 and its radio bright supernova sn 2000 ft from 1998 until 2006 , using the vla at 8.4 ghz in a configuration .",
    "our 8.4 ghz vla monitoring of sn 2000 ft for almost six years ( @xmath136 2100 days ) has allowed us to show that its radio emission follows a rather steep decline ( @xmath137 ; @xmath138 ) , which is typical of supernovae exploding in ",
    "normal  environments .",
    "this result implies that the late time radio emission of sn 2000 ft is still being powered by its interaction with the presupernova stellar wind , rather than by interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in fact , we find that the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is rather large @xmath0@xmath1 , even at a supernova age of @xmath2 days .",
    "this value is about three times larger than the inferred ism pressure in the starburst regions of m 82 at a similar distance .",
    "therefore , the pressure of the ism where sn 2000 ft exploded must be smaller than the ram pressure of the presupernova stellar wind , as otherwise we should have seen evidence of a flattening of the 8.4 ghz flux density time decay .",
    "the swept - up mass by the supernova shock , after 2127 days of assumed free expansion in a steady , spherically symmetric wind ( @xmath139 ) , is @xmath4 , and implies that the mass ejected in the explosion of sn 2000 ft must have been significantly larger . at this sn age , the shock has reached a distance @xmath3 pc , and our 8.4 ghz vla observations probe the interaction of the sn with material that was ejected by the progenitor star ( via its stellar wind ) , about 5820 yr prior to its explosion .",
    "this wind material has a particle density @xmath140 , which is similar to expected values of @xmath141 in the dusty , dense environments of starbursts .",
    "we also searched in our radio images for recently exploded core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "apart from sn 2000 ft ( @xmath142 ) , we found no evidence for rsne more luminous than about ( @xmath143 ) , suggesting that no other type iin sn has exploded since 2000 in the circumnuclear starburst of ngc 7469 .",
