    "strange hadrons may play a crucial role in the properties and evolution of nuclear material under extreme conditions  @xcite .",
    "the interior of neutron stars provide one such environment in which the densities are high enough that it may be energetically favorable to have strange baryons present in significant quantities , depending upon their interactions with non - strange hadrons .",
    "further , it may be the case that a kaon condensate forms due to strong interactions between kaons and nucleons  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical analysis of both scenarios is somewhat plagued by the limited knowledge of the interactions of strange hadrons with themselves and with non - strange hadrons .",
    "heavy - ion collisions , such as those at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , also produce nuclear material in an extreme condition .",
    "recent observations suggesting the formation of a low - viscosity fluid are quite exciting as they provide a first glimpse of matter not seen previously .",
    "the late - time evolution of such a collision requires an understanding of the interaction between many species of hadrons , not just those of the initial state , including the interactions between strange mesons and baryons .",
    "while pion interferometry in heavy - ion collisions is a well - established tool for studying the collision region ( for recent theoretical progress , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the star collaboration has recently published the first observation of neutral kaon ( @xmath3 ) interferometry  @xcite . in the analysis of @xmath3-@xmath3 interferometry",
    ", the non - resonant contributions to the final state interactions between the kaons were estimated using three - flavor ( @xmath4 ) chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5-pt ) , the low - energy effective field theory of qcd .",
    "given the sometimes poor convergence of @xmath4 @xmath5-pt due to the relatively large kaon mass compared to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath6  gev ) , particularly in the baryon sector , it is important to be able to verify that the non - resonant contributions to @xmath7-scattering are indeed small , as estimated in @xmath5-pt .",
    "in this work we present the first lattice qcd calculation of the @xmath0 scattering length .",
    "the calculations are performed on the coarse milc lattices ( with a preliminary calculation on one ensemble of the fine milc lattices ) and three - flavor mixed - action @xmath5-pt ( ma@xmath5-pt ) , which includes the leading - order lattice - spacing effects , is used to extrapolate to the continuum and to the ( isospin - symmetric ) physical value of the meson masses .",
    "we find that at the physical value of @xmath1 @xmath8 where the statistical and systematic errors have been combined in quadrature .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are identified as the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and therefore the form of their interactions is highly constrained .",
    "in fact , at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath5-pt , the scattering of two of these mesons is uniquely determined  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the lo scattering amplitude arise in a systematic expansion about the chiral limit  @xcite , scaling generically as @xmath12 where @xmath13 counts the order in the chiral expansion  @xcite . for obvious reasons , @xmath14 @xmath5-pt",
    "is expected to converge more slowly than two - flavor @xmath5-pt .",
    "there is a wealth of phenomenological and theoretical knowledge concerning low - energy @xmath15 scattering .",
    "the chiral extrapolation formulae for @xmath15 scattering are known to two loops , or next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , in both @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite @xmath5-pt .",
    "combined with a roy equation analysis  @xcite , this has allowed for remarkably - precise determinations of the two @xmath17-wave @xmath15 scattering lengths  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath18 systems , the extrapolation formulae for the scattering amplitudes are known to one  @xcite and two loops  @xcite and have allowed for theoretical predictions of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 scattering lengths .",
    "however , the uncertainty in these theoretical predictions is substantial .",
    "there are proposed experiments to study the @xmath18 atoms by the dirac collaboration  @xcite at cern , j - parc and gsi , which will significantly reduce the uncertainty in these scattering lengths . to date , there have been no experimental determinations of the @xmath21 scattering length , @xmath22 , but recently it has been calculated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath5-pt  @xcite .    the methods for studying two - particle interactions in a finite euclidean volume are well known  @xcite .",
    "the interaction energy of two hadrons in a finite volume uniquely determines @xmath23 , and hence their scattering amplitude , below kinematic thresholds .",
    "the scattering parameters , such as the scattering length and effective range , can then be determined from calculations of @xmath23 over a range of energies .",
    "these methods paved the way for pioneering quenched qcd calculations of two - particle interactions a little over a decade ago  @xcite . since then , there have been a number of additional quenched calculations of the @xmath24 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "the first dynamical calculation of @xmath15 interactions ( including the phase - shift ) was performed by the cp - pacs collaboration with two flavors ( @xmath25 ) of improved wilson fermions  @xcite and pion masses in the range @xmath26  mev .",
    "recently , dynamical calculations of the @xmath24 scattering length with three flavors of light quarks ( @xmath27 ) were performed with pion masses in the range @xmath28  mev .",
    "these calculations used a mixed - action scheme of domain - wall valence fermions on asqtad - improved staggered sea fermions at a single lattice spacing of @xmath29  fm  @xcite , and used mixed - action @xmath5-pt ( ma@xmath5-pt ) ( which describes the finite - lattice spacing effects ) calculations of the scattering length  @xcite to extrapolate to the physical meson masses .",
    "only recently has the first calculation of the @xmath30 scattering length in quenched qcd been performed  @xcite , and a fully - dynamical @xmath27 calculation  @xcite followed shortly afterward .",
    "when combined with @xmath5-pt , this latter calculation allowed for a simultaneous prediction of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath31 scattering lengths using the nlo extrapolation formulae  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] contains the details of our mixed - action lattice qcd calculation .",
    "discussion of the relevant correlation functions and an outline of the methodology and fitting procedures can also be found in this section .",
    "the results of the lattice calculation and the analysis with ma@xmath5-pt are presented in section  [ sec : extrapolate ] . in this section ,",
    "the various sources of systematic uncertainty are identified and quantified . in section  [ sec : conclude ] we conclude .",
    "in calculating the @xmath0 scattering length , the mixed - action lattice qcd scheme developed by the lhp collaboration  @xcite was used in which domain - wall quark  @xcite propagators are generated from a smeared source on @xmath32 asqtad - improved  @xcite rooted staggered sea quarks  @xcite . to improve the chiral symmetry properties of the domain - wall quarks , hypercubic - smearing ( hyp - smearing )  @xcite",
    "was used in the gauge links of the valence - quark action . in the sea - quark sector , there has been significant debate regarding the validity of taking the fourth root of the staggered fermion determinant at finite lattice spacing  @xcite . while there is no proof , there are arguments to suggest that taking the fourth root of the fermion determinant recovers the contribution from a single dirac fermion  . the results of this paper assume that the fourth - root trick recovers the correct continuum limit of qcd .",
    "the present calculations were performed predominantly with the coarse milc lattices with a lattice spacing of @xmath29  fm , and a spatial extent of @xmath33  fm . on these configurations ,",
    "the strange quark was held fixed near its physical value while the degenerate light quarks were varied over a range of masses ; see table  [ tab : milccnfs ] and refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "further , preliminary calculations were performed on 506 configurations of one fine milc ensemble .",
    "on the coarse milc lattices , dirichlet boundary conditions were implemented to reduce the original time extent of 64 down to 32 and thus save a factor of two in computational time .",
    "while this procedure leads to minimal degradation of a nucleon signal , it does limit the number of time slices available for fitting meson properties .",
    "by contrast , on the fine milc ensemble , anti - periodic boundary conditions were implemented and all time slices are available .",

    "the last column is the number of configurations times the number of sources per configuration . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the counterterms extracted from the mixed - action lattice calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : su3compare ] as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that while there appears to be a difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , more precise calculations of both scattering lengths , particularly at the lightest pion masses , are required for further exploration of higher order terms in the chiral expansion .",
    "we have presented results of a lattice qcd calculation of the @xmath0 scattering length performed with domain - wall valence quarks on asqtad - improved milc configurations with 2 + 1 dynamical staggered quarks .",
    "the calculations were performed on the coarse milc lattices with a lattice spacing of @xmath39 ( with a preliminary calculation on one ensemble of the fine milc lattices with @xmath40 ) and at a single lattice spatial size of @xmath41 .",
    "one - loop ma@xmath5-pt with three flavors of light quarks was used to perform the chiral and continuum extrapolations .",
    "our prediction for the physical value of the @xmath0 scattering length is @xmath42 , and we emphasize once again that this result rests on the assumption that the fourth - root trick recovers the correct continuum limit of qcd .",
    "deviations from weinberg s tree - level prediction are found to be surprisingly small , consistent with the lattice calculations of the @xmath43 scattering length at heavier pion masses .",
    "we thank r.  edwards and b.  joo for help with the qdp++/chroma programming environment  @xcite with which the calculations discussed here were performed .",
    "the computations for this work were performed at jefferson lab , fermilab , lawrence livermore national laboratory , national center for supercomputing applications , and centro nacional de supercomputacin ( barcelona , spain ) .",
