    "in strong magnetic fields , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a double quantum well system ( dqws ) is well known to support spontaneous interlayer coherence if the interwell separation is smaller than some critical value @xmath3 . at filling factor @xmath4 ,",
    "the interlayer coherence is reponsible for many interesting properties of the 2deg such as a quantum hall state , a goldstone mode @xcite ( in the absence of tunneling ) associated with the broken u(1 ) symmetry of the pseudospin order in the ground state , which has been recently detected experimentally spielman , and exotic topological quasiparticle excitations such as merons and bimerons . when the magnetic field is inclined towards the plane of the 2deg in the @xmath4 coherent state , a radical change in the behavior of the transport gap",
    "was observed @xcite and explained as a commensurate - incommensurate transition in the pseudospin ordermacdocomincom .",
    "a review of these properties can be found in ref .  .",
    "at bigger filling factors , in landau levels @xmath0 , it has been shown breydoublestripes that the 2deg in a dqws can support states where both the electronic densities and the interlayer coherence are spatially modulated .",
    ".   discussed the ground state of the dqws at filling factors @xmath1 when both wells have exactly the same number of electrons using the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "they showed that , for some range of interwell separations , a `` staggered '' stripe state is lowest in energy .",
    "this state involves a unidirectional charge density wave ordering of electrons in each well , such that the regions of high electron density in one well are nearest to regions of low electron density in the other .",
    "stripe states in single well systems were first discussed by koulakov , fogler , and shklovskii and moessner and chalker @xcite and are believed to explain a large anisotropy observed in transport experiments for quantum hall systems in moderate magnetic fields , for which the highest energy occupied landau level is approximately half - filled expstripes .    in a dqws ,",
    "stripe states are more complex and interesting than in the single layer case because of the possibility that interlayer coherence may coexist with charge ordering . in the staggered stripe state ,",
    "interlayer coherence is maintained only along linear regions at the edges of the stripes .",
    "these `` linear coherent regions '' ( lcr s ) , whose width decreases with increasing interlayer separation , support topological quasiparticle excitations closely akin to sine - gordon solitons @xcite . in the absence of tunneling , ct and",
    "fertig@xcite showed that this staggered stripe state supports two goldstone modes associated respectively with broken translational symmetry and broken u(1 ) symmetry associated with interlayer coherence .    in this paper",
    ", we address the questions of how the staggered stripe state and its collective excitations are modified by the presence of a magnetic field component parallel to the plane of the layers and how these changes are reflected in the tunneling current .",
    "we recall @xcite that , in the presence of a parallel magnetic field , the tunneling hamiltonian can be written as an effective zeeman coupling of the form@xmath5where @xmath6is the pseudospin density and @xmath7 is a pseudo - magnetic field that rotates in the @xmath8 plane . in this paper , we choose @xmath9 along the @xmath10 axis and use a gauge in which this pseudo - field is given by @xmath11 , \\]]where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the separation between the wells , and @xmath14 the magnetic length due to the in - plane component @xmath15 of the magnetic field . at filling factor @xmath4 , the ground state at small layer separation and @xmath16",
    "is well approximated by a state in which all pseudospins are oriented along the @xmath17 axis ( we assume that the bare tunneling energy @xmath18 is not zero ) . when the parallel magnetic field is turned on , the pseudospins rotate in the @xmath8 plane , aligning with the local orientation of @xmath19 .",
    "this defines a uniform commensurate state , which we will call the commensurate liquid ( cl ) .",
    "when @xmath15 increases , the rotation period of the pseudospins decreases .",
    "this rotation is opposed by the coulomb exchange interaction that tends to keep peudospins parallel . above some critical @xmath15",
    ", there is a phase transition to an incommensurate state where the pseudospins no longer rotate with the in - plane field but instead tend to align along some common direction as @xmath15 increases above the critical value .",
    "we call this state the incommensurate liquid ( il ) state .",
    "it is this change in the ground state of the 2deg with @xmath15 that is believed to be responsible for the radical change in the behavior of the transport gap observed by murphy et al . @xcite    in the experiment of murphy _ et al .",
    "_ , the system consisted of two homogeneous two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with filling factor ( in each well ) @xmath20 and in landau level @xmath21 .",
    "the same commensurate - incommensurate transition should occur in higher landau levels at total filling factors @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", however , we must recognize that , for @xmath22 , the system is unstable to the formation of stripes as was shown in ref .  . in the pseudospin language , this staggered stripe state consists of pseudospin modulation in the @xmath23 plane . applying a parallel magnetic field",
    "will tend to induce a commensurate rotation of the pseudospins in the @xmath8 plane in addition to the @xmath23 modulations . in this paper",
    ", we call this phase a commensurate stripe phase ( csp )",
    ". if the parallel field is too strong , the exchange energy cost of this commensurate rotation will be prohibitive and the ground state will revert to a state with @xmath23 modulations only as if there were no tunneling and no parallel field .",
    "we call this other state an incommensurate stripe phase ( isp ) .",
    "as @xmath13 and @xmath15 are changed for a given tunneling parameter , we thus expect a rich phase diagram with transitions between the four possible states just introduced : cl , il , cspand isp .",
    "( we can not , of course , rule out the possibility of other ground states with lower energy ) .    in higher landau levels ,",
    "the effect of @xmath15 is more complex than for @xmath21 .",
    "this is because the tunneling amplitude in the @xmath24th landau level has a non trivial @xmath15 dependence , @xmath25 , with @xmath18 the bare tunneling amplitude .",
    "for @xmath0 , this tunneling amplitude oscillates with wavevector @xmath12 , becoming negative in some range of @xmath15 .",
    "one effect of these oscillations is that @xmath15 can induce not only one but several ( reentrant ) commensurate - incommensurate transitions in the liquid or in the stripe phases depending on the value of @xmath24 .",

    "the areas in white(gray ) represent the commensurate(incommensurate ) liquid state .",
    "the heavy line marked @xmath3 indicates the critical spacing above which one of the stripe state ( either commensurate or incommensurate ) is lower in energy than both the cl and il phases.,width=311 ]    another effect of the parallel field is that , in the commensurate stripe phase ( csp ) , the long - wavelength dispersion relations of the low - energy phonon and pseudospin wave modes will be strongly dependent on @xmath15 through @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the gap in the pseudospin wave mode ( which is related to the broken u(1 ) symmetry of the pseudospin order ) and in the phonon mode ( at finite wavevector ) follows the oscillations of the tunneling amplitude @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the phonon and pseudospin wave modes become essentially gapless whenever the parallel field is such that @xmath30 is close to one of its @xmath24 zeroes .",
    "such behavior is not seen in the incommensurate stripe phase ( isp ) since the properties of this state are independent of @xmath30 and so of @xmath15 .",
    "we thus find that the csp and isp are clearly distinguishable by their low - energy collective modes .",
    "figure 2 illustrates these modes as computed using the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation , as explained in more detail below .     and @xmath31 t.,width=311 ]    one way to probe these states is via interlayer tunneling .",
    "for very small values of @xmath18 , the tunneling @xmath2 has been argued @xcite and shown @xcite to probe the goldstone mode dispersion of the ( spontaneously ) coherent state as the parallel field is adjusted .",
    "an analogous effect occurs in the stripe state of this system , as illustrated in fig .",
    "a clear signature of the existence of stripes can be found by noting the non - monotonic behavior of the tunneling peak as a function of @xmath32 .",
