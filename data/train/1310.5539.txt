    "one of the most challenging open problems in graph theory is the cycle double cover conjecture which was independently posed by szekeres  @xcite and seymour  @xcite in the seventies .",
    "it states that every bridgeless graph has a cycle double cover , that is ,  a system @xmath4 of cycles such that each edge of the graph belongs to exactly two cycles of @xmath4 .",
    "extensive attempts to prove the cycle double cover conjecture have led to many interesting concepts and conjectures .",
    "in particular , some of the stronger versions of the cycle double cover conjecture are related to embeddings of graphs on a surface .",
    "the jaeger s directed cycle double cover conjecture  @xcite states that every cubic graph with no bridge has a cycle double cover @xmath4 to which one can prescribe orientations in such a way that the orientations of each edge of the graph induced by the prescribed orientations of the cycles are opposite .",
    "jaeger s conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every cubic bridgeless graph has an embedding on a closed orientable surface with no dual loop .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we took a new approach to jaeger s conjecture , see proposition  [ prop : dualloops ] , motivated by the notion of critical embeddings .",
    "critical embeddings are used extensively as a discrete tool towards mathematical understanding of criticality of basic statistical physics models of ising and dimer , and conformal quantum field theory of free fermions  @xcite .",
    "we formulated the existence of embeddings of cubic bridgeless graphs with no dual loops as the existence of special perfect matchings in a subclass of braces that we call hexagon graphs .      in the current work ,",
    "we introduce new key notions of _ safe reductions _ and _ cut obstacles_. the main results of this work are summarized in theorems  [ thm.main1 ] ,  [ thm.main2 ] and  [ thm : contsubofcub ] .",
    "we prove that the directed cycle double cover conjecture is valid for all lean fork - graphs .",
    "the class of all lean fork - graphs is natural and rich . on the one hand",
    "this class is inductively defined starting from a triangle by sequentially adding `` ears '' ; ears are the so - called fork - type graphs . on the other hand for each cubic bridgeless graph @xmath0",
    "it is possible to construct a lean fork - graph that contains a subdivision of @xmath0 as an induced subgraph .",
    "jaeger s directed cycle double cover conjecture trivially holds in the class of cubic bridgeless planar graphs .",
    "however , little is known about its validity in other classes of graphs .",
    "indeed , our results establish for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , the validity of jaeger s conjecture in a rich inductively defined class of graphs .",
    "much more is known about the weaker cycle double cover conjecture .",
    "jaeger  @xcite proved that any minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture is a snark ; namely ,  a connected cubic graph which can not be properly edge - colored with three colors .",
    "the famous snark is the petersen graph .",
    "alon and tarsi  @xcite conjectured that the edge set of every bridgeless cubic graph with @xmath5 edges has a cycle cover where the total sum of the length of the cycles is at most @xmath6 , and jamshy and tarsi  @xcite proved that this conjecture implies the cycle double cover conjecture .",
    "existence of a cycle double cover in the classes of 3-edge - colorable and 4-edge - connected cubic graphs have also been positively settled  @xcite .",
    "the cycle double cover conjecture also holds for all cubic bridgeless graphs that do not contain a subdivision of the petersen s graph  @xcite and for graphs which have hamiltonian paths  @xcite .",
    "the important connection with the theory of nowhere - zero - flows is exploited in  @xcite .    in the next section we present the main ideas on which our work is based and formally establish our contributions .",
    "one natural way of starting the construction of a directed cycle double cover of a cubic bridgeless graph @xmath0 with vertex set @xmath7 and edge set @xmath8 is to select a vertex @xmath9 and to _ wire _ its incident edges @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 : this creates a directed triangle consisting of three new directed edges @xmath13 .",
    "once such a directed triangle is formed , the vertex @xmath14 and the edges @xmath15 are deleted from @xmath0 , resulting in a new _ mixed _ graph with vertex set @xmath16 and edge set @xmath17 , together with a set @xmath18 of directed edges of the triangle .",
    "we can continue this procedure by sequentially selecting a vertex @xmath19 in @xmath16 and wiring its incident edges and arcs .",
    "we note that for some pairs of the created directed edges , it is forbidden to belong to the same cycle of a directed cycle double cover .",
    "_ if _ we could continue this procedure until every edge is wired , we _ might _ be able to show the existence of a directed cycle double cover .",
    "but , this naive approach leads to the following crucial questions : what do mixed graphs look like , in the middle of the wiring procedure ?",
    "for which classes of graphs is it possible to apply the wiring procedure until we find a directed cycle double cover ?",
    "what are _ obstacles _ that hinder the continuation of the wiring procedure ?",
    "the first question leads to the definition of _ mixed graphs _ , and to the novel concept of _ safe reductions_. the last two questions to concepts of _ fork - collections _ , _ fork - graphs _ , and _ cut - obstacles_.",
    "a _ mixed graph _ is a 4-tuple @xmath20 where @xmath7 is the vertex set , @xmath8 is the edge set , @xmath21 is the set of the directed edges ( arcs ) , and @xmath22 is a subset of @xmath23 , that is , a set of pairs of arcs .",
    "we require that in the graph induced by @xmath8 , each vertex has degree at least two and at most three , and that each vertex of degree two is the tail of exactly one arc and the head of exactly one arc .",
    "regarding the discussion in the previous paragraph , the set @xmath22 contains those pairs of arcs , which can not be together in the same directed cycle of the constructed directed cycle double cover .      a _ reduction _ of a subset @xmath24 of the vertices of a mixed graph",
    "is defined naturally as wiring the edges and directed edges incident with @xmath24 , and updating @xmath22 .",
    "however , @xmath22 becomes complicated and actually our life would be easier if we could avoid it .",
    "it turns out that indeed updating @xmath22 is not necessary if we perform _",
    "safe reductions_.    let @xmath20 be a mixed graph and @xmath25 .",
    "we say that a mixed graph is obtained from @xmath20 by a _ safe reduction _ of @xmath24 if it is constructed as follows .",
    "we replace each edge in @xmath8 incident to a vertex of @xmath24 by two arcs oppositely directed ; let these new arcs form the set @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the subset of @xmath21 that contains all directed edges incident to a vertex of @xmath24 .",
    "then we partition @xmath28 into safe directed cycles and safe directed paths with both end vertices in @xmath29 . a cycle or a path is _ safe _ if it has at most one edge from @xmath27 , and if it is not a 2-cycle composed of only edges from @xmath26 .",
    "finally we replace each chosen safe path by the directed edge between its end vertices and then , we delete the vertices of  @xmath24 . in figure",
    "[ fig.safe-reduction-mixed-graphs ] , we show an example of a safe reduction .      in order to construct directed cycle double covers , we decide to perform only safe reductions .",
    "hence , the set @xmath22 introduced in the definition of mixed graphs is not needed .",
    "we observe that to get a directed cycle double cover of a cubic graph @xmath0 it is sufficient to consecutively perform safe reductions , starting by safely reducing a subset , say @xmath24 , of the vertex set of  @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , let @xmath30 be the mixed graph obtained from @xmath0 by a safe reduction of @xmath24 .",
    "then this safe reduction of @xmath24 along with consecutive safe reductions of subsets @xmath31 that partition @xmath7 construct a directed cycle double cover of @xmath0 .      which are the configurations that do not allow us to perform safe reductions ?",
    "we refer to them as _",
    "obstacles_. we first observe that if @xmath32 , where @xmath7 is the vertex set of a mixed graph , and no safe reduction of @xmath24 exists , then no safe reduction of @xmath33 exists .",
    "for instance , a bridge is an obstacle : if a mixed graph with vertex set @xmath7 has an edge whose deletion separates @xmath7 into two sets with no edge or arc between them , then there is no safe reduction of @xmath7 .",
    "another basic notion of our reasoning is a generalization of a bridge which we call _ cut - obstacle_. let @xmath24 be a subset of vertices of a mixed graph , and let there @xmath34 and @xmath27 denote the sets of edges and arcs , respectively , with exactly one end - vertex in @xmath24 .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is a _ cut - obstacle _ if there is no set @xmath35 of pairs in @xmath36 such that each edge of @xmath34 is in exactly two pairs of @xmath35 , each arc of @xmath27 is in exactly one pair of @xmath35 and no pair of @xmath35 contains two arcs .",
    "we note that bridges are cut obstacles .",
    "in addition , an important example of a cut obstacle is formed by a subset @xmath24 of vertices such that the number of edges with exactly one end in @xmath24 is strictly less than twice the number of directed edges with exactly one end in @xmath24 .",
    "aside of cut obstacles , there is a wide variety of other concrete obstacles to the existence of safe reductions .",
    "however , it appears hopeless to analyze and keep track of all of them .",
    "this leads to a natural question :    _ is there a class @xmath37 of cubic bridgeless graphs such that : ( 1 ) the dcdc conjecture may be reduced to the dcdc conjecture for @xmath37 , and ( 2 ) for each graph @xmath0 of @xmath37 , the existence of consecutive safe reductions which do not create cut obstacles leads to the existence of a directed cycle double cover ? _    in this work we propose the class of lean fork - graphs as a candidate for such class @xmath4 .",
    "the basic structures for the construction of _ fork graphs _ are contained in the _ fork - collection_. the fork - collection , denoted by @xmath38 , consists of the _ @xmath39-big - forks _ for every @xmath40 , the _ p - fork _ , the _ fork _ , the _ star fork _ , the _ subfork _ and the _ dot_. the p - fork , the fork and the star fork are depicted in figure  [ fig.subforks ] , while a subfork is simply a pair of vertices connected by an edge and a dot is an isolated vertex .",
    "the 1-big - forks are depicted in figure  [ fig.bigfork ] .",
    "if @xmath41 is 1-big - fork , we let @xmath42 be the _ connecting set _ of @xmath41 . for @xmath43 , each @xmath39-big - fork @xmath41 is obtained from a @xmath44-big - fork @xmath45 and a star fork @xmath46 by connecting two leaves of @xmath46 to two vertices of degree at most two of @xmath45 with the following restriction : if we connect to a vertex of degree 2 , then it can not belong to @xmath47 .",
    "we let @xmath48 , where @xmath14 is the remaining leaf of @xmath46 .",
    "this operation is well explained in figure  [ fig.bigfork ] , since each 1-big - fork is obtained from a fork and a star fork in exactly the same way .",
    "we refer to 1-big - forks simply as big - forks .",
    "furthermore , the _ exclusive fork - collection _",
    "@xmath49 is a subset of @xmath50 that contains all members of @xmath50 but the fork .",
    "[ fig.bf1 ]    given a member @xmath51 of the fork - collection , a _",

    "we say that a cubic graph @xmath0 is a _ fork graph _ if there is a sequence @xmath56 of 2-connected graphs so that @xmath57 is a triangle , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is obtained from @xmath60 by connecting to its vertices of degree @xmath61 the half - edges of a bold @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is from the exclusive fork - collection ; therefore , half edges of a bold @xmath62 become edges of @xmath63 . in addition",
    ", we allow that for at most one @xmath55 , @xmath64 is the fork ; the fork is depicted in figure  [ fig.fork ] .",
    "moreover , we can perform several y@xmath2 , @xmath3y transformations ; that is ,  replacement of a vertex by a triangle , and vice - versa .",

    "<S> the study of hexagon graphs leads us to define a new class of graphs that we call _ lean fork - graphs_. fork graphs are cubic bridgeless graphs obtained from a triangle by sequentially connecting fork - type graphs and performing y@xmath2 , @xmath3y transformations ; lean fork - graphs are fork graphs fulfilling a connectivity property . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that jaeger s conjecture holds for the class of lean fork - graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the class of lean fork - graphs is rich ; namely , for each cubic bridgeless graph @xmath0 there is a lean fork - graph containing a subdivision of @xmath0 as an induced subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> our results establish for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , the validity of jaeger s conjecture in a broad inductively defined class of graphs . </S>"
