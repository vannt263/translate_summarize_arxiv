    "aside from the limited compositional information gathered in situ after the landing of near shoemaker  @xcite and during two touch - down maneuvers of hayabusa  @xcite , no dedicated scientific study has been conducted on the surface of an asteroid yet .",
    "two previous attempts of dedicated landers have been unsuccessful , although the primary spacecraft was the reason for failure in both cases : the prop - f lander  @xcite , a spherical  hopper \" with a diameter of @xmath0500 mm , a mass of @xmath050 kg and a designed lifetime of 4h , was aimed to investigate the surface of the martian moon phobos ( believed to be a captured asteroid resembling a c - type spectra  @xcite ) with eight instruments , resulting in a total payload mass of @xmath08 kg .",
    "however , contact with the carrier spacecraft was lost prior to its deployment .",
    "more recently , the lander  @xcite , the smallest planetary probe built to date , was released during an unexpected ascending maneuver of hayabusa which resulted in a relative speed exceeding escape velocity of the target asteroid .",
    "although the probe never reached the surface of itokawa , telemetry data at least verified the lander operated nominally for @xmath018h after deployment  @xcite .",
    "minerva had a cylindrical shape with a length of 100 mm , a diameter of 120 mm and a weight of < 600 g .",
    "its payload consisted of three cameras derived from commercial webcam modules and six temperature sensors .",
    "though a high level of miniaturization of space instruments and landers is currently feasible , the example of illustrates that very small landers  also referred to as surface science packages  are very limited in their scientific capabilities .",
    "in contrast , complex traditional lander concepts with multiple instruments and objectives , such as the philae lander on rosetta  @xcite , exceed mass and cost budgets of low - cost small spacecraft exploration missions to near - earth asteroid ( nea ) targets .",
    "the ten - week  small satellite summer study program ( s4p ) \" held at nasa ames research center in 2008 had the explicit goal to study options to use small cost - efficient spacecraft for future missions to neas while being aware of their limitations .",
    "one result of the program is the discovery - class mission concept  didymos explorer ( dex ) \"  @xcite intended to investigate the binary asteroid , a potentially hazardous nea with a spectral class not yet visited .",
    "it became clear that surface investigations are an essential contribution to future nea exploration missions as it is impossible to study micro - scale surface features remotely , making a lander also a key element of dex .",
    "still , it remained unclear if a lander can fit into the mass limitations of a small spacecraft .",
    "as a lander is a fully independent , specialized spacecraft on its own , having fundamentally different requirements and constraints than the orbiter , a separate study was necessary to derive reliable estimates to answer this question .",
    "this lead to the concept study of a small lander called  panic \" , the  pico autonomous near - earth asteroid in situ characterizer \" , which has been conducted by a second group in parallel to dex and also continued after the program .",
    "the study s motivation was to determine the feasibility of a micro - scale lander concept that will provide a balance between spacecraft size and science return .",
    "a specific design concept was developed based on information about currently available technologies and hardware estimates .",
    "the results of this study will be summarized in this paper .",
    "remotely acquired reflectance spectra of asteroids are likely altered by processes of  space weathering \" ( e.g. lower albedo , slope - reddening ; see e.g.  @xcite for details ) which hinders their interpretation regarding mineralogical composition and possible links to known meteorites .",
    "so far , space weathering effects could only be studied directly using returned lunar soil samples . to be able to better constrain the composition of neas , it is a key scientific interest to study the surface properties and structure on the micro - scale in situ in support of or as an alternative to a sample return .",
    "the following main scientific objectives have been defined for a lander mission by the study team as a starting point for further investigations (  straw man proposal \" ) :    1 .   characterize the bulk composition and geochemistry . establish a link between the target body and a meteorite class already known .",
    "2 .   investigate the particle size distribution on the surface .",
    "3 .   study and constrain the effects of space weathering regarding changes in the optical characteristics .",
    "secondary mission goals are :    a.   demonstrate mobility in a microgravity environment through hopping for the first time",
    ". b.   study surface diversity through measurements at multiple locations .",
    "c.   demonstrate an advanced level of miniaturization in planetary probe design .",
    "a comprehensive payload survey revealed a number of highly miniaturized instruments which had already been developed for previous missions or are currently in development .",

    "acquired imagery after each successive hop will provide a random survey of the surface .",
    "the acquired images are also vital for public outreach purposes , since the picture could be the first taken from an asteroid s surface .",
    "the stereo approach provides redundancy  in case one of both cameras fails , the remaining data will still impart an impression of the landing site .",

    "this implies a surface gravity on the order of 10 g  @xcite  comparable in its magnitude to the remaining accelerations aboard the international space station or sounding rockets  @xcite  and escape velocities on the order of .",
    "the lander needs to be carried by a primary spacecraft which is heading for a rendezvous orbit at the asteroid and releases the lander during a low - altitude maneuver in close proximity . in a matter analogous to both the previously mentioned and several other proposed small body exploration landers ( e.g.  @xcite )",

    "mobility to study surface diversity is a mission requirement .",
    "still , the mission will be counted as a success if one complete set of science data is gathered at the initial landing site and successfully transmitted to the orbiting spacecraft . the lander will aim to acquire data at a minimum of two different sites in order to sample surface diversity .",
    "considering the necessary durations of data collection and uplink for a minimum of two sites , the lifetime of the lander has to be on the order of .",
    "the study s target mass of @xmath010 kg led to the development of a ",
    "pod lander \" concept  a lander , which can place itself in a defined orientation by means of external actuators such as petals or rods .",
    "although penetrators enable subsurface access in microgravity , they are limited to single point measurements and have not been successfully demonstrated on previous interplanetary missions ( see failures on mars 96 , ds-2  @xcite ) . since porosity and mechanical resistance of the upper surface layers of asteroids are poorly understood , using a penetrator concept remains a high risk mission .",
    "conventional rovers are not an appropriate solution for nea exploration due to the microgravity environment .",
    "the canceled micro hybrid rover - hopper  @xcite is a prime example of the limitations of rovers on nea surfaces .",
    "it was estimated that surface dynamics would limit its maximum speed to @xmath01mm / s .    from all geometries considered by the study team",
    ", a tetrahedral shape appears to be the most favorable for a pod lander .",
    "a sphere has been discarded as it might have severe difficulties settling on a surface full of slopes and depressions within reasonable time scales .",
    "a tetrahedron has the lowest number of faces of all polyhedrons and hence requires only three actuators for self - righting .",
    "the simple straight geometries of the design appear to be beneficial in terms of fabrication and utilization of volume .",
    "the synchronous deployment of radially symmetrically arranged petals is advantageous as the applied torques cancel each other out . a tip over of the lander during the self - righting process on a rough",
    ", boulder - rich or sloped surface can be intercepted by the petals in every direction .",
    "moreover , panic can directly use its petals to induce a hop by quickly pushing them into the soil , while limited control on the direction of the hop could be implemented through slightly different petal actuation .",
    "in contrast , a discoidal design  a pod lander with only one lid as on beagle  2  @xcite , which is able to flip over  does not allow any control over hopping direction as it has only one actuated petal .",
    "although imprecise , this hopping mechanism provides a robust mobility system which can overcome the perils of rough asteroid surfaces and enables the lander to travel large distances on rather short time scales .",
    "the mobility of the lander allows for a representative surface sampling within its short lifetime , which is limited by the capacity of its non - rechargeable primary batteries .",
    "in a manner analogous to the hayabusa mission , this study assumes the lander is released during a low altitude maneuver of several tens of meters at a relative velocity close to zero .",
    "this leads to an impact velocity on the order of 10cm / s , a value which must be below the local escape velocity to safeguard the lander against loss following a rebound from a very hard surface .",
    "it is further assumed that the orbiter will ascend to an inertial sub - solar position ( between the sun and the asteroid , altitude ) to hover over the asteroid after release of the lander .",
    "therefore , data transmission in the nominal mission sequence is limited to daytime periods only . a third assumption in order to limit the parameter space for",
    "this study shall be that day and night have the same length ( about 6h ) .",
    "of course , the actual hours of daylight depend greatly on the orientation of the asteroid s rotation axis and latitude of the landing site .    for landing and hopping simulations ,",
    "the initial simplification in our model has been a triaxial ellipsoid asteroid with constant density whose gravitational field is represented using spherical harmonic expansions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we eventually came to the conclusion that spherical harmonic series only converge outside the circumscribing sphere of the ellipsoid ( the so - called  brillouin sphere \" ) .",
    "severe divergence can happen inside of this sphere , especially the deeper the test point mass is inside of it .",
    "therefore , this approach only works for a simplified orbit analysis of the primary spacecraft , but not to describe the movement of a lander very close to the surface .",
    "a much better approach for the analysis of the lander dynamics is the use of ellipsoidal harmonic expansions which converge outside the body s circumscribing  brillouin ellipsoid \" that is congruent to the hypothetical ellipsoidal asteroid ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "an alternative approach would be to use a polyhedron  @xcite or a finite element shape model ( e.g. consisting of cubes or spheres )  @xcite to calculate the asteroid s gravity field .    to work around the divergence errors of spherical harmonic expansions",
    ", it was necessary to further simplify the asteroid to a sphere with an equivalent radius derived from itokawa s volume .",
    "these simplified simulations still show that the lander will need considerable time to settle after the initial landing or following a hop . depending on the surface s coefficient of restitution ( literature estimates :  @xcite ; measurement on itokawa : 0.84  @xcite ) ,",
    "coefficient of friction ( itokawa : > 0.8  @xcite ) and remaining relative velocity after release ( ) , settling times on the order of after the release from the orbiter and after a hop have been estimated .",
    "the lander still consumes power during these time periods as it must be able to detect its own settlement and daylight phase .",
    "the on - board science instruments ( with the exception of the sc ) would benefit from night time operations .",
    "the mic and nirs can be calibrated to implemented artificial light sources which illuminate their targets .",
    "this allows a more reliable interpretation of the acquired images and spectra , which would be at risk to be contaminated by solar stray light during day time .",
    "the nirs detector has to be cooled by a thermo electrical cooler ( tec ) to sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the apxs is required to operate at low temperatures in order to keep the detector noise at an acceptable level . keeping the limited battery capacity of the lander in mind , night time operations are a requirement to allow for valuable scientific investigations as it is virtually impossible to operate  and therefore cool  the nirs and apxs during daytime hours .    as discussed later in section  [ sec : subsystems ] , night time operations would also have a positive impact on thermal control .",
    "the heat dissipated by the electronics would help to keep the lander compartment warm .",
    "this reduces the necessary heat emission of an active heater which ensures that the lander s temperature does not fall below critical values for operation and storage of the implemented hardware .",
    "as less energy is consumed for heating , a second hop and third instrument cycle are feasible with the available battery power at battery temperatures above 0c .",
    "figure  [ fig : missiontimeline ] illustrates an example mission sequence for a scenario where instrument operations ( except for the sc ) are limited to night .",
    "the lander approaches the target and settles on the surface in an arbitrary orientation after a number of bounces .",
    "in this scenario , the side petals are deployed when the craft is at rest and nightfall has occurred , pushing the lander into an upright position .",
    "once the lander is in the appropriate configuration , the mic , apxs and nirs will subsequently acquire data .",
    "a stereo image is taken following sunrise .",
    "data transmission is triggered by the orbiter sending a specific command .",
    "after the uplink has been successfully finished , the lander relocates through hopping , retracts its petals on its initial ballistic trajectory and comes again to a rest on the surface after several bounces .",
    "it remains in stand - by until nightfall and repeats its data acquisition , uplink and hopping cycle until the batteries are drained .",

    "the microscopic imager is likely to produce the largest amount of data , since many images ( @xmath060 ) are necessary due to the very short focal length and resulting depth of field ( @xmath040 m , as estimated for beagle  2  @xcite ) .",

    "due to the intended use of cots components , radiation shielding is a main design driver .",
    "although the lifetime of the lander on the surface will be very short , the lander will likely spend many years in space and must have sufficient radiation tolerance for this environment . due to the absence of a shielding atmosphere ,",

    "based on previous work ( e.g.  @xcite ) it appears realistic to assume the c&dh unit can be realized on two pcbs with a pc/104 form factor , weighing 125 g each and consuming 2.5w of power in operational and 0.75w in idle mode .",

    "the study demonstrates that significant surface science on an asteroid can be done with a lander of the 10 kg class .",
    "the presented design will be limited to a non - destructive surface analysis without any subsurface access .",
    "it will be able to study the bulk geochemical composition with an advanced scientific payload and provide mobility through hopping to investigate surface diversity .",
    "the required orbiter infrastructure and release mechanism have not been studied within this work .",
    "the primary spacecraft has to provide a deployment device which safely holds the lander during launch and cruise , keeps it within storage temperature on the interplanetary trajectory , provides power for system checks and instrument calibrations before deployment ( to not discharge the lander s primary cells ) , and releases it with a predefined velocity at the target .",
    "additionally , the orbiter acts as a relay station , transmitting commands from ground operators to the lander as well as science and telemetry data uplinked from the lander to earth .",
    "hence , it must provide a high gain antenna and transceiver in the selected communication band as well as enough mass memory for intermediate data storage .",
    "given the derived lander mass of 12.3 kg including margins , a total mass envelope of 15 kg appears realistic to implement the lander with any necessary infrastructure to the main spacecraft .",
