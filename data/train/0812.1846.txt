    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is commonly envisioned as a self - regulating system in statistical quasi - equilibrium .",
    "multiple components of gas with varying densities and temperatures coexist @xcite , animated by turbulence that pervades the whole volume .",
    "different components of gas play different roles in the ism ecosystem , with the coldest and densest portions responsible for star formation .",
    "massive stars , when they are born , energize the ism through the hii regions and supernova blasts they create @xcite ; this energy input is important in replenishing continual losses through turbulent dissipation .",
    "uv radiation from young massive stars is also crucial in heating the gas .",
    "the rate of star formation is determined by the available supply of dense gas , which in turn is regulated by the interplay between dynamics and thermodynamics in the ism , and is affected by the galactic environment in which the ism is contained . while this overall framework is generally accepted and is supported by existing theory and observations , much work remains on both fronts to quantify the dependence of statistical properties on the global system parameters , and to establish when and how self - regulated quasi - steady states are achieved .",
    "given the importance of time - dependent processes and interdependencies in the ism , complex theoretical models are needed in order to address even rather basic questions .",
    "for example , what sets the relative proportions of the different gas components ? in an idealized classical picture such as that of @xcite for the atomic medium , given a pressure and a mean density @xmath14 , thermal equilibrium defines a density for each of two stable phases , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the ratio of cold to warm gas is given by a simple algebraic relation : @xmath17 . in the real ism , however , which is a time - dependent system , thermal equilibrium only holds to the extent that the radiative times are short compared to dynamical times for compressions and rarefactions .",
    "furthermore , the value of the mean density @xmath14 and pressure ( averaged over large scales ) are not even known _ a priori _ for a given ism surface density , since the vertical distribution of gas is sensitive to its dynamical state .",
    "this dynamical state itself depends on the ( unknown ) dense gas fraction , since more dense gas produces more feedback from star formation , and hence more turbulence that inflates the disk vertically to reduce @xmath14 ( and also produces local variations in density and pressure through compressions and rarefactions ) .",
    "multidimensional effects ( the ism is not simply stratified perpendicular to the galactic plane , but is composed of filamentary clouds ) and self - gravity additionally complicate the situation .    in recent years",
    ", a number of groups have begun developing models of the turbulent , multiphase ism using time - dependent computational hydrodynamics simulations that include feedback from star formation , self - gravity of the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and both of these effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the treatment of feedback in these simulations is to inject thermal energy in regions identified as sites of star formation ; most models focus on the energy input from supernovae . in very large scale simulations that have minimum resolution of only 50 - 100 pc , feedback implemented via thermal energy deposition",
    "is not in practice very effective , because the input energy is easily radiated away . with finer numerical resolution ,",
    "feedback regions expand adiabatically at first to make hot diffuse bubbles , driving shocks that sweep up surrounding gas and ultimately generate turbulence throughout the computational domain .",
    "a number of different issues have been addressed by these recent simulations , including investigating departures from thermal equilibrium in density and temperature pdfs , measuring the relative velocity dispersions of various gas components , and testing whether relationships between star formation and gas surface density emerge that are similar to empirical kennicutt - schmidt laws .    even before the advent of supernovae , massive stars photoionize their surroundings , creating hii regions within molecular clouds that are highly overpressured and expand .",
    "hii regions may in fact be the most important dynamical agents affecting the properties of dense gas in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , since the original turbulence inherited from the diffuse ism is believed to dissipate within a flow crossing time over the cloud @xcite , while gmcs are thought to live for at least a few crossing times @xcite .",
    "analytic and semi - analytic treatments find that gmcs with realistic sizes , masses , and star formation rates can indeed be maintained by the energy input from hii regions for a few crossing times , ultimately being destroyed through a combination of photoevaporation and kinetic energy inputs that unbind the remaining mass @xcite .",
    "recent three - dimensional numerical studies have begun to address this process in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , focusing on regions within gmcs .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider how the large - scale dynamical state of the ism is affected by star formation feedback in the form of expanding hii regions .",
    "our main interests are in exploring how the turbulence driven by hii regions affects the properties of dense gas ( we measure statistics of density , temperature , and velocity ) , in testing ideas of global self - regulation by feedback ( we evaluate toomre @xmath5 parameters and virial ratios ) , and in exploring how galactic environment systematically affects the character of the ism , including its ability to form stars .",
    "complete ism models should of course include feedback from supernovae as well as those from hii regions , and it is our intention to do this in future work . however , we consider it useful to adopt a sequential approach , independently testing the effects of hii region feedback to provide a baseline for more comprehensive simulations .",
    "in addition to developing a physical understanding of the ways in which feedback affects the ism , another goal of our work is to investigate the sensitivity of numerical results to prescriptions that are a necessary  but not always fully tested  aspect of galactic - scale studies of star formation . in particular , we examine how the choice of density threshold in commonly - adopted recipes for star formation affects the resulting dependence of the star formation rate on ism surface density .",
    "our approach to exploring the effects of galactic environment is to conduct a large suite of local simulations that cover a range of values for three basic parameters : the total surface density of gas in the disk ( @xmath2 ) , the local midplane stellar density ( @xmath3 ) , and the local rate of galactic rotation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the parameter range covers a factor of six in gas surface density and galactic angular rotation rate , and a factor of 30 in stellar density .",
    "our suite is divided into four series , each of which has one independent parameter that is systematically varied .",
    "we also include comparisons with hydrostatic models that are identical in terms of their input parameters to the fully - dynamic models , but do not include feedback and hence are not turbulent .",
    "for this first set of pilot studies , we have not implemented full radiative transfer to evaluate the extent of hii regions ( we intend to do so in the future ) , but instead introduce a simple prescription in which the boundaries of hii regions are determined by the gravitational potential .",
    "using this approach ( rather than , for example , adopting a single fixed outer radius ) has the advantage that the volume of the heated region expands as the density surrounding the source drops . since our treatment of hii regions",
    "does not attempt to be exact , we do not consider our specific results for e.g. velocity dispersions to be more than approximate ( although in fact we find similar values for velocity dispersions in dense gas to those that are observed in gmcs ) .",
    "instead , we shall emphasize the general properties of a multiphase ism system in which turbulence is driven from within the dense phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe our numerical methods , and in particular the recipe for star formation feedback .",
    "the control parameters for our disk models , and the properties of each model series , are presented in  3 .",
    "section 4 gives an overview of evolution based on our fiducial model . in ",
    "5 we present the statistical properties of the gas in each model , and test environmental influences by intercomparing the model series .",
    "the implications of our results for star formation , both in real galaxies and in numerical simulations , is analyzed in  6 .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in  [ summary ] .",
    "we study the evolution of rotating , self - gravitating , galactic gas disks , including local heating and cooling terms .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations in a local cartesian reference frame whose center lies at a galactocentric radius @xmath18 and orbits the galaxy with a fixed angular velocity @xmath19 . in this local frame , radial , azimuthal , and vertical coordinates are represented by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively , and terms associated with coordinate curvature are neglected @xcite .",
    "the local - frame equilibrium background velocity relative to the center of the box at @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the local dimensionless shear rate . in terms of @xmath26 ,",
    "the local epicyclic frequency @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 we shall choose @xmath29 for all models , representing a flat background rotation curve @xmath30 for the unperturbed motion .",
    "in addition to the tidal gravity and coriolis terms from the `` shearing sheet '' local formulation , we also include terms for the vertical gravity of the stellar disk , gas self - gravity , radiative heating and cooling , and thermal conduction . the resulting equations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are : @xmath31   + k\\nabla^2t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "with @xmath34 the number of hydrogen nuclei per unit volume , @xmath35 varies from 0.6 to 1.1 depending on whether the gas is predominantly molecular or atomic ; we simply adopt @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt @xmath37 to include the contribution of helium to the mass density . here",
    "@xmath38 is the internal energy per unit volume ( we adopt @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath41 is the self - gravitational potential due to gas , and the vertical gravitational force due to stellar disk is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the stellar density and @xmath22 is the vertical coordinate relative to the midplane . in the above expressions and elsewhere in the remainder of the text , we have dropped the `` 0 '' subscript on @xmath4 ; @xmath27 also refers to the value evaluated at the center of the domain .",
    "computation of the gas self - gravity is discussed below .    in this paper ,",
    "we present results of two - dimensional simulations of the above set of equations .",
    "the two independent spatial coordinates in our models are @xmath44 and @xmath22 ; thus , we follow evolution in radial - vertical slices through a galactic disk . although the azimuthal ( @xmath45 ) direction is not an independent spatial variable for the current set of models , we do include azimuthal velocities , and their variation with @xmath44 and @xmath22 .",
    "inclusion of @xmath46 is important because angular momentum can strongly affect the ability of self - gravitating perturbations to grow .",
    "radial motions that are required for gas to become concentrated are coupled to azimuthal motions through the coriolis force ; perturbations in the azimuthal velocity with respect to the mean background shear correspondingly lead to radial motions via the coriolis force .",
    "although our two - dimensional models do capture some of the effects of galactic rotation ( i.e. epicyclic oscillations ) , they miss some of the effects associated with shear . in three dimensions ( or in the height - integrated @xmath47 plane ) , azimuthal shear can make it more difficult for self - gravitating concentrations to grow .",
    "of course , in three dimensions , self - gravity also increases more rapidly as the density increases , which enhances the ability of dense concentrations to grow .",
    "although it will be important to revisit the present models with fully three - dimensional simulations , we do not anticipate large changes based on dimensionality .",
    "previous three - dimensional simulations of shearing , rotating disks have found similar ( within a factor 2 ) nonlinear instability thresholds for self - gravitating cloud formation to reduced - dimensional models ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "thermal instability also develops similarly in the two - dimensional and three - dimensional case to create a cold cloud / warm intercloud structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .      the numerical solutions to the two - dimensional dynamical equations are obtained using a temporally and spatially second order finite volume method which includes tvd runge - kutta integration in time @xcite , with a directionally unsplit flux update and piecewise linear reconstruction with slope limiter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we use roe s approximate riemann solver with an entropy fix @xcite .",
    "the heating and cooling terms in the energy equation are separated out in an operator - split fashion and updated using implicit time integration ( see  [ sec : cooling ] ) , because the cooling times are frequently much shorter than the other timescales .",
    "the code is parallelized using mpi .    for the hydrodynamic update ,",
    "the time step is set to @xmath48 where @xmath49 and we adopt @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "here , @xmath53 is the sound speed in any zone . with a large value of @xmath54 , the explicit hydrodynamic timestep is not strongly limited by the cooling time in dense gas .",
    "the adopted @xmath54 is chosen such that the solution agrees with tests of individual expanding `` hii regions '' ( for our feedback model ) that have @xmath55 ( equivalent to explicit cooling ) ; if a much larger value of @xmath56 is allowed , this expansion is not accurately reproduced .    at the @xmath44 ( radial )",
    "boundaries , we implement shearing - periodic boundary conditions @xcite , in which the azimuthal ( angular ) velocity term @xmath57 is incremented or decremented by @xmath58 in mapping from the right@xmath59 left or left@xmath59 right boundary , consistent with the equilibrium velocity field . in the @xmath22-direction",
    ", we adopt periodic boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic variables , such that the total mass in the domain is conserved . at a constant value without devoting significant computational resources to following the evolution of a tenuous corona at large @xmath60 . ]",
    "the gravitational potential solver applies open ( i.e. vacuum ) boundary conditions in @xmath22 , as we next discuss .",
    "we have developed a new method for obtaining the gravitational potential of a disk in cartesian geometry using fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) .",
    "since the discrete fourier transformation allows only periodic functions , a special approach is needed to solve for a disk potential with vacuum boundary conditions outside the simulation domain .",
    "let us consider a simple case , consisting of an a uniform , isolated gas sheet in the @xmath61 plane which has density @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding gravitational potential @xmath63 is obtained by solving the poisson equation , @xmath64 with vacuum boundary conditions .",
    "if we have a finite domain of size @xmath65 and suppose that the gas sheet lies somewhere within the domain , then we only would require values of the potential at locations within @xmath66 of the sheet .",
    "thus , we may find the potential within @xmath67 in terms of discrete fourier components as @xmath68 @xmath69 in fourier space , the poisson equation for one independent variable is @xmath70 thus , in terms of discrete fourier components with @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 equating the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq : phi_ell1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_ell2 ] ) and inserting the expression from equation ( [ eq : c_ell ] ) , this implies @xmath73 for the isolated sheet , so that the density in real space is obtained by taking an inverse transform : @xmath74 we see that the first term corresponds to the original density",
    ". however , a second term has appeared as an image density with the opposite sign from the real ( physical ) density , located a domain length away .",
    "this means that to obtain the correct solution for @xmath41 on the original domain @xmath75 , we need to prepare twice as large a box in the vertical direction , and implement the required image density within the augmented domain , at a distance @xmath66 from the physical slab .",
    "thus , a density slab at @xmath76 would require an image slab at @xmath77 in @xmath78 , and a density slab at @xmath79 would require an image slab at @xmath80 in @xmath81 .",
    "using a similar procedure , we have extended this idea to the three dimensional case with an arbitrary density distribution @xmath82 .",
    "the details are described in the appendix .",
    "we note that the numerical solution agrees with the solution obtained via green functions @xcite , and is much faster to compute because only ffts ( no direct sums ) are needed .      to allow for multiphase interstellar gas components",
    ", we must solve a thermal energy equation that allows a wide range of conditions .",
    "we use a cooling function for the diffuse ism derived by @xcite , which includes atomic gas cooling for the warm and cold neutral medium ( wnm , cnm ) , as well as cold molecular - phase cooling ( h@xmath83 , co , and dust cooling ) .",
    "we include a constant volumetric heating rate to represent photoelectric heating by diffuse fuv .",
    "this yields a standard ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) thermal equilibrium curve in which there is a maximum density and pressure for the warm phase given by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and a minimum density and pressure for the cold phase given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phase-1 ] ) .",
    "hii regions in the real ism include photoionization of atoms and dissociation of molecules , and radiative cooling of photoionized gas and warm molecular gas .",
    "these effects depend on chemical fractions , as well as dust evaporation . for this work",
    ", we are interested primarily in dynamics of the neutral media , rather than the details of photoionized gas  including the complexities of ionization front propagation at sub - parsec scales .",
    "the main requirement for capturing the large - scale dynamical effects of feedback is thus to incorporate photoheating of gas in star - forming regions .",
    "the simple but expedient approach we have chosen is to expose gas in targeted regions to enhanced heating , while simply applying the same cooling function we use for neutral gas .",
    "the enhanced heating we apply yields thermal equilibrium for the `` photoheated '' gas at @xmath88k ( see below ) , which is consistent with the temperatures that would be attained if we had implemented realistic ( but much more computationally complex and expensive ) photoprocesses .",
    "cooling and heating timescales often become much shorter than the hydrodynamic time step ( i.e. the flow or sound crossing time of a grid zone ) , especially in hii regions , which have a high heating rate . for efficiency ,",
    "we adopt implicit time integration for the heating and cooling operators . in a given zone , the integral from the ( j ) to the ( j+1 ) time step",
    "is formally expressed as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the heat capacity per particle .",
    "this is a nonlinear equation with respect to @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 treated as parameters . for this integral , we adopt simpson s rule and solve using the newton - raphson method .",
    "thermal conduction determines the thickness of interfaces between phases in the ism , and proper incorporation of conduction is essential in numerical simulations of a multiphase medium which is subject to thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the characteristic length scale set by conduction is the field length , @xmath94 @xcite , which corresponds to the critical wavelength of thermal instability . for realistic values of the conductivity at @xmath95 , @xmath96 erg @xmath97 s@xmath98 k@xmath98 @xcite ,",
    "the field length of 0.19 pc ( at density @xmath99 and temperature 1,000 k ) is much smaller than the size of interstellar clouds ( @xmath100 1  10 pc ) and we would need extremely high spatial resolution to resolve it  and a correspondingly high computational cost .",
    "instead , we adopt an approach somewhat analogous to the use of artificial viscosity ( far exceeding the true physical viscosity in magnitude ) in resolving shocks on a numerical grid .",
    "namely , we adopt a sufficiently large numerical conduction coefficient to resolve the field length on our chosen grid .",
    "we choose @xmath40 such that for any simulation with resolution @xmath101 , the field number @xmath102 is equal to 1.7 at density and temperature typical of thermally unstable gas ( we use @xmath103 , @xmath104 k ) .",
    "for example , the fiducial model q11 has @xmath105 pc and the artificial conductivity gives @xmath106 pc for thermally unstable gas .    for low density gas ,",
    "given our typical values of @xmath40 the thermal conduction term can become greater than cooling / heating terms . in order to limit the conduction in these regions , we adopt @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "the primary focus of this work is to explore the dynamical effects of strong , localized heating by ob stars in dense regions of the ism . since this heating produces @xmath109 k gas that is initially overpressured by a factor @xmath110 or more compared to its surroundings , hii regions expand rapidly .",
    "this process is believed to be an important source of turbulence both within self - gravitating gmcs and in the surrounding diffuse ism . to study this process ,",
    "ideally one would implement ( a ) formation of ob stars from dense gas , distributed throughout the space - time domain of the simulation ; ( b ) radiative transfer of ionizing photons from the ob stars through the surrounding gas , with potentially multiple ionization sources throughout the domain ; ( c ) detailed ionization and heating of the gas within hii regions .",
    "in this first exploration , rather than attempting to model all of these processes in an exact fashion , we instead adopt an idealized approach , with the goal of gaining physical understanding .",
    "first , we apply certain criteria to determine when and where `` star zones '' on the grid will be turned on .",
    "then , we apply strong heating to the gas in the vicinity of each `` star zone '' for the duration of its lifetime .",
    "all `` star zones '' have the same lifetime , @xmath111 , which is set to @xmath112 yr , the typical lifetime of ob associations in clouds whose mass is @xmath113 @xcite . within hii regions ,",
    "we assume a constant gas heating rate , set via a control parameter @xmath114 .",
    "each `` star zone '' is therefore essentially a control flag for whether or not strong photoheating is locally applied near that zone ( which does not move ) . rather than solving a radiative transfer problem",
    ", we use a simple criterion based on the gravitational potential to determine whether gas is subject to strong heating .",
    "because our goal is to identify gas localized around star - forming regions , it is necessary to subtract out the background gravitational potential and retain just the potential component due to an individual self - gravitating cloud .",
    "the background potential is the potential averaged over horizontal planes .",
    "in terms of fourier components , the relative gravitational potential @xmath115 is defined as @xmath116 here , @xmath117 is the fourier component of a smoothing window function , @xmath118},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is a smoothing length .",
    "this window function smooths the hii region within a radius @xmath120 .",
    "convolution of the relative potential with a smoothing function ( or , equivalently , multiplication in fourier space as above ) is desirable so that any heating that is applied is resolved on the grid .",
    "we have adopted @xmath121 as providing adequate resolution .",
    "hii photoheated regions are identified as regions where the relative potential , @xmath122 , falls below some specified level : @xmath123 .",
    "we also employ the relative potential @xmath122 for setting one of the criteria for turning on feedback : @xmath124 and @xmath125 must both be met in a given zone for a `` star zone '' to be created at that location .",
    "thus , our recipe ensures that feedback will only occur in dense and self - gravitating regions , consistent with the fact that ob stars are observed to form only under these conditions .    for the feedback prescription we have adopted ,",
    "there are five control parameters : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath111 , @xmath128 , @xmath114 .",
    "the detailed estimation of those parameters is described in the remainder of this section .",
    "we choose a density threshold for star formation as @xmath129 this density is comparable to that of clumps of gas within gmcs .",
    "the free fall time at this density , 1.4 myr , is sufficiently small compared to the orbital time that structures satisfying this threshold evolve independently of the global environment .",
    "note that the local jeans length @xmath130 must be resolved by a few zones in order to prevent fragmentation occurring as a consequence of numerical artifacts @xcite .    to obtain an estimate for the potential threshold for star formation",

    "most of the dense filaments and clumps in the lower panel correspond to cold gas in the upper panel . in the upper panel , the orange circle associated with the cloud near @xmath211",
    "pc shows an active hii region , in which the gas is both warm and dense and hence is expanding rapidly .",
    "expansion of shells slows at later times ( after the pressure drops to ambient values and the enhanced heating turns off ) . since most of the time for any given shell is spent near the maximum expansion , the widely - expanded structure of the middle cloud is typical , in terms of the time - averaged state .",
    "figure [ fig : snap-2 ] shows a snapshot of the density and temperature in the same model q11 at a time 38 myr later .",
    "overall , the structure is qualitatively similar , although details change because the state is highly dynamic .",
    "there are still three main collections of filaments ; the middle cloud has a large shell while the left- and right - side clouds have contracted onto the midplane and have nearly reached the point at which new hii regions will be born .",
    "three large `` clouds '' within the 1.16 kpc horizontal length of the domain corresponds to mean separations of 390 pc .",
    "one might expect the number of cloud entities to be related to the properties of star formation feedback , and for our adopted prescription to the parameter @xmath170 , which effectively determines the maximum volume of an hii region : large @xmath170 corresponds to large hii regions , whereas small @xmath170 corresponds to hii regions only in the immediate vicinity of a potential minimum defined by a high - density clump of gas .",
    "in a situation with multiple local minima in the gravitational potential , if @xmath170 is large then a single hii region could engulf what would be multiple hii regions in the case of small @xmath170 .",
    "expansion and shell collision of many small hii regions would produce more ( but smaller ) clouds than expansion and collision of a few large hii regions .",
    "in fact , when we run the same model but set @xmath212 , we find that there are typically 4 - 5 clouds in the same domain .",
    "we conclude that the number of large clouds is not _ very _ sensitive to @xmath170 , but since this control parameter can only approximately model the effects of real hii regions , the current study can not provide an exact prediction for the size or mass of gmcs .",
    "we note that the typical separation is , however , in the same range as the two - dimensional jeans length at the typical velocity dispersion , @xmath213 for this model .",
    "figure [ fig : phase-1 ] shows the phase diagram ( @xmath214 plane ) for the same snapshot in figure [ fig : snap-1 ] and [ fig : snap-2 ] .",

    "we overlay the thermal equilibrium curves for both the cases of `` normal '' heating ( solid curve ) and the enhanced heating in hii regions ( dashed curve ) .",
    "clearly , most of the gas resides near thermal equilibrium , due to the short cooling times compared to the longer hydrodynamical times .",

    "the volume pdf shows that the volume is mainly occupied by warm and diffuse gas ( wnm ) at densities of a few @xmath215 . in terms of the mass pdf ,",
    "there are two peaks : one corresponds to the wnm , and the other to a cold component at density above @xmath216 .",
    "figure [ fig : time ] shows the time evolution of thermal , kinetic and potential energies averaged over the domain , for model q11 .",
    "for the potential energy , the background disk potential is subtracted out ; i.e. we use @xmath122 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : relative potential ] ) .",
    "there are many sharp spikes in both thermal and kinetic energies , which correspond to times when new hii regions are born and then rapidly expand .",
    "the number of spikes corresponds to the number of stellar generations in the model ; note that this number must be proportional to the domain size . in the second rotational period ( i.e. , @xmath217 rotation ) , there are 18 generations per 1.16 kpc , or 6 generations per massive cloud per rotation period ( i.e. an interval of @xmath218 yr ) if the mean number of clouds is 3 in this fiducial model .",
    "other models show similar overall behavior in terms of the evolution of physical structure ( consisting of clumps and filaments that disperse and re - collect ) , as well as the distribution of mass in the phase plane . as environmental parameters vary along a sequence , however , there are some characteristic changes in structure .",
    "the most notable difference is that for high gaseous surface density cases , clouds are often more physically concentrated ( i.e. , more compact and dense ) because of the higher stellar and gaseous gravity .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : snap-3 ] shows a snapshot from model q42 , which has @xmath2 and @xmath43 four and 16 times larger , respectively , than the values in the fiducial model q11 .",
    "the three clouds that are seen in the figure are more compact than in the lower-@xmath43 case . for a given @xmath219 and @xmath170",

    "all of our models show a turbulent , multiphase ism with several generations of feedback from photoheating . in this section ,",
    "we analyze how the statistical properties of those models depend on the environmental parameters , both along a given series and from one series to another .",
    "the statistical properties that we study are based on averages of the fluid variables over space and time .",
    "first we describe how these averages are defined in general , and then we turn to the particular statistics .      for a variable of @xmath220 that is averaged over both space and time",
    ", we use mass - weighted averages defined by : @xmath221 where the argument ` @xmath222 ' denotes a given phase or component of the gas ( such as wnm ) .",
    "the time averaging is then defined via : @xmath223 where the step function @xmath224 gives @xmath225 if @xmath226 and @xmath227 otherwise , so that only intervals in which the component is present are included in the averaging .",
    "note that @xmath228 if the component ` @xmath222 ' is present somewhere in the domain at every interval during the simulation .",
    "thus , we denote spatial and temporal averages using angle brackets and overlines , respectively . to avoid the initial transients at the beginning of the simulation",
    ", we adopt the interval between @xmath229 and @xmath230 for our time average . for the purpose of averaging ,",
    "our sampling rate is @xmath231 , where @xmath232 yr is the adopted lifetime of `` star zone '' flags that control photoheating feedback .",
    "the models of this paper focus on dynamics rather than chemistry , so rather than dividing the gas into distinct phases , we simply bin it according to density .",
    "the neutral gas ( i.e. the gas that is not within the limits defining hii regions ) is separated into four bins .",
    "the first bin ( @xmath233 ) corresponds approximately to the wnm , with densities below the maximum for which a warm phase is possible in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second bin ( @xmath234 ) extends up to the maximum density that is in pressure equilibrium with wnm gas , and corresponds approximately to the cnm ( phase diagrams show that the thermally - unstable regime is not highly populated for our models ; see e.g. figs [ fig : phase-1 ] and [ fig : pdf-1 ] ) . the dense medium ( hereafter dm )",
    "is all the gas at @xmath235 , which in thermal equilibrium is above the maximum pressure for the warm phase and therefore only exists in regions that are internally stratified due to gravity .",
    "the dm gas corresponds approximately to the molecular component of the ism ; we divide it into two bins , dm2 ( @xmath236 ) and dm3 ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "gas that is within the limits defined for enhanced heating is labeled as ionized gas ( hereafter hii ) .",
    "so that the mass fractions @xmath238 of all components add to unity , @xmath239 , we use a slightly different definition from that of equation ( [ eq : space - time - av ] ) .",
    "the mass fraction of each component @xmath222 in ( wnm , cnm , dm2 , dm3 or hii ) is defined as @xmath240    figure [ fig : mass ] shows the mass fraction of the various components either as a function of surface density ( series q , r and k ) or angular velocity ( series s ) . for series q and r ( which most closely correspond to the radial variations found within normal spiral galaxies ) , at low @xmath2 the diffuse ( wnm+cnm ) components dominate , while at high @xmath2 the dense ( gravitationally - confined ) components ( dm2+dm3 ) dominate .",
    "the behavior is somewhat different in series k , which is highly gravitationally unstable and thus extremely active when @xmath2 is large ( since @xmath27 is constant ) , leading to larger hii and cnm mass fractions at high @xmath2 . at low @xmath2 ,",
    "the behavior in series k is similar to that in series q and r. for all series , the hii mass fraction increases at higher @xmath2 or lower @xmath4 , corresponding to lower toomre @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig : qvalue ] ) and hence higher rates of stellar feedback activity .",
    "the mass fraction of the wnm component secularly declines with increasing @xmath2 in model series q , k , and r. even though the models of series s are most gravitationally unstable at low @xmath4 , they remain dominated by diffuse gas ( cnm ) rather than dense gas , because the total surface density is relatively modest for this series ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "the simulation domain for our two - dimensional models represents a radial - vertical ( @xmath242 ) slice through a galactic disk , such that if we viewed the corresponding galaxy face - on , the surface density as a function of radius would be given by @xmath243 .",
    "the area - weighted mean surface density in any model is equal to @xmath244 ; this is a conserved quantity for any simulation , and is one of the basic model parameters ( see column 2 of table [ tbl : models ] ; in general we omit the angle brackets and `` a '' subscript ) .",
    "the value of the surface density weighted by mass rather than by area better represents the `` typical '' surface density of clouds found in the disk .",
    "this is defined as @xmath245 figure [ fig : s ] shows @xmath246 as a function of @xmath2 for all model series .",
    "interestingly , we find that @xmath246 does not strongly depend on parameters ( either @xmath2 or @xmath4 ) throughout the four model series .",
    "the largest value of @xmath246 is @xmath247 and the smallest is @xmath248 , although for most cases the range is even smaller : @xmath249 .",
    "this factor - of - two range for @xmath246 is significantly smaller than the factor - of - six range of mean surface densities , @xmath250 .",
    "the range of @xmath246 is also similar to the typical observed surface densities of giant molecular clouds ( see discussion in  [ summary ] ) .",
    "this weak variation of @xmath246 among the various series suggests that it is star formation feedback , rather than the feedback - independent parameters , that determines the typical surface density of clouds .",
    "in particular , other tests we have performed suggest that it is the gravitational potential threshold for star formation @xmath127 that most influences @xmath246 .",
    "a model in which @xmath251 ( with any @xmath170 ) would have photoheating events independent of the local ism properties ; the consequent expansion of hii regions would thoroughly mix gas so that @xmath252 .",
    "this is indeed what we find when we run models with @xmath253 a factor 10 below our adopted value . on the other hand ,",
    "larger values of @xmath253 require more massive and compact clouds in order to have star formation , which would raise @xmath246 .",
    "tests with @xmath253 a factor 10 above our adopted value indeed result in larger @xmath254 ( although only by a factor @xmath255 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath170 is much weaker than the dependence on @xmath127 ; reducing @xmath170 by a factor 10 changes @xmath246 by only tens of percent , at our standard @xmath127 .",
    "the comparison between series q and series r is also interesting , in this regard .",
    "the difference between these two series is that the stellar density @xmath43 increases with @xmath2 in series q , while @xmath43 is constant throughout series r. based on the larger @xmath246 value for the largest @xmath2 in series q compared to series r , when the stellar density is increased , the surface density required in order to form clouds also increases .",
    "figure [ fig : temp ] shows the space - time averages of temperature for the components we have defined via density bins , @xmath256 , where the argument ` @xmath222 ' denotes wnm , cnm , dm2 , dm3 and hii . throughout the model series ,",
    "the temperatures for the most dense and most diffuse components are fairly constant ; we find @xmath257 k for wnm , @xmath258 k for dm2 , and @xmath259 k for dm3 .",
    "for the cnm component ( which in fact includes thermally - unstable gas when it exists ) , the range is somewhat larger , @xmath260 k , reflecting the larger range of conditions for this gas .",
    "the gas which is subject to enhanced heating has mean temperatures for most models of 4,000  8,000 k.    the link between density and temperature in our models implies that the components we have defined via density bins also approximately correspond to natural ism phases .",
    "this is because much of the gas mass is close to thermal equilibrium ( see figure [ fig : phase-1 ] ) , and we have chosen the bin edges so as to match up to points in the phase plane with physical significance .",
    "temperature pdfs that we have constructed show a bimodal distribution , as is expected based on the cooling function .",
    "expansion of hii regions feeds kinetic energy into the ism .",
    "this kinetic energy is not imparted solely to expanding hii bubbles and shells surrounding them , but is shared throughout the ism as turbulence .",
    "our models provide a first look at the results of this form of turbulent driving .",
    "it is interesting to examine how the turbulent amplitudes vary from one component to another in a given model , and how the overall levels vary between models with different feedback rates as a consequence of different system parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : velocity ] shows the turbulent velocity dispersions for all series , defined for each component as : @xmath261 where the argument ` @xmath222 ' denotes wnm , cnm , dm2 , dm3 and hii , and @xmath262 in order to subtract out the velocity of unperturbed ( sheared ) rotation about the galactic center .",
    "the azimuthal velocities are excited by coriolis forces so that the relation for epicyclic motions @xmath263 should apply @xcite , and we have checked that this is in fact satisfied .",
    "we note that the velocity dispersion for each component is computed by summing over the whole domain .",
    "thus , the measured velocity dispersions are larger than they would be within smaller - scale clouds in the system .",
    "however , we have found that there are not large contributions to the velocity dispersion from velocity differences of widely - separated regions ; this is because turbulence is driven by the expanding hii regions , such that the maximum correlation scale is comparable to the effective thickness of the disk . for example , if we divide the domain in fig .",

    "[ fig : snap-3 ] , the mean internal velocity dispersions are an order of magnitude larger than the dispersion in mean velocities",
    ".    in general , the densest component ( dm3 ) has the lowest velocity dispersion , with the next - densest ( dm2 ) the next - lowest .",
    "the value of the velocity dispersions for the dense components are highly supersonic , and are similar to ( or slightly below ) those that are observed within real gmcs ( see  [ summary ] ) .",
    "the cnm component in our models typically has higher turbulence levels than the wnm component , because the former is in closer ( space - time ) contact with energy sources .",
    "because turbulent motions in our models are driven by the pressure of photoheated gas , @xmath266 , the turbulent velocities have an upper limit of the sound speed in gas heated to 8,000 k , @xmath267 .",
    "since the driving is intermittent , this upper limit is not usually reached ; mean values for the diffuse gas are closer to @xmath268 .",
    "the diffuse - gas velocity dispersions in our models are lower by about 50% compared to observed levels , indicating ( consistent with expectations ) that other turbulence sources are important in the real diffuse ism .    the model series q and r , which have @xmath269 ( and thus effectively constant gaseous toomre @xmath5 if the velocity dispersion is constant ) show velocity dispersions that are insensitive to the value of @xmath2 .",
    "series k , on the other hand , has much higher turbulence levels for large @xmath2 .",
    "this is because , with constant @xmath4 ( @xmath270 ) the high-@xmath2 models are quite susceptible to gravitational instability ( in terms of @xmath5 ) ; this leads to very active feedback which then raises the velocity dispersion .",
    "a similar physical effect is seen in series s : the velocity dispersion is highest at low @xmath4 , since these are the most gravitationally - susceptible models among the series .",
    "we discuss measurements of the effective toomre @xmath5 values that account for turbulence , in the next subsection .      for a rotating disk that contains only thermal pressure , susceptibility to growth of self - gravitating perturbations depends on the toomre @xmath5 parameter , defined by setting @xmath196 equal to the thermal sound speed in equation ( [ eq : toomreqdef ] ) .",
    "an infinitesimally - thin gas disk is unstable to axisymmetric perturbations if the value of this thermal @xmath5-parameter is @xmath271 @xcite .",

    "turbulence at scales below the wavelength of gravitational instability can also help to suppress the growth of large - scale density perturbations , by contributing to the effective pressure .",
    "since the original toomre parameter is arrived at based on effects of radial pressure gradients , only the radial component of the velocity dispersion should be added to the thermal velocity dispersion in defining an effective @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : toomreqdef ] ) .",
    "it is natural to expect galactic disks to self - regulate the values of the effective @xmath5 : growth of self - gravitating instabilities subsequently leads to star formation and energetic stellar feedback , which drives turbulence , raises @xmath5 , and tends to suppress further gmc formation .",
    "indeed , the suggestion that galactic star formation is self - regulated through turbulent feedback dates back to the earliest work on large - scale instabilities in galactic gas disks @xcite , with @xcite making the related suggestion that galaxies deplete their gas until they reach marginal stability .",
    "the self - regulation processes are complex , but they have begun to be studied in recent numerical simulations ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we use the results of our models to measure the values of the effective toomre parameter in the saturated state .",
    "we compare four different measurements of @xmath5 in each model .",
    "the first is closest to toomre s original definition for a gaseous medium in that it is based on thermal velocity dispersion ; since our medium has components at differing temperatures , we use a mass - weighted thermal velocity dispersion : @xmath273 the second measurement incorporates turbulence , again including all gas and weighting by mass : @xmath274 for the third and fourth measurements , we consider only the dense gas for both the numerator and denominator : @xmath275 and @xmath276 here , the mass fraction of dense gas @xmath277 is given in eqn ( [ eq : fraction ] ) .",
    "the turbulent velocities dominate the dense gas when they are included , since the thermal sound speed is @xmath278 whereas turbulent velocities are several times larger ; see fig .",

    "the only significantly larger values are for the low-@xmath2 models in series k , which have large @xmath27 and hence the thermal value @xmath279 is large ; when turbulence is included this is raised even more . since series",
    "q and r have @xmath194 constant , the value of @xmath279 is simply proportional to the mass - weighted thermal velocity dispersion .",
    "the increased fraction of cold gas at high @xmath2 leads to a corresponding decrease in @xmath279 .",
    "since the thermal and turbulent velocity dispersions of the dense gas are small compared to those of the diffuse components , the dense components contribute to @xmath279 and @xmath280 mostly by lowering the mass fraction of the diffuse components , in the numerator . because turbulent contributions are positive - definite , @xmath283 .",
    "the strongest evidence of self - regulation by feedback - driven turbulence is seen in the saturated - state results for @xmath282 . with the low values of the temperature in the dense component , the thermal - only values for the dense gas are mostly @xmath284 . when turbulence is included , however , the saturated - state value of @xmath282 is between 1 and 2 for almost all models .",
    "this is consistent with expectations for marginal instability .",
    "we note in particular that velocity dispersions in series k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] ) vary strongly with @xmath2 ( by a factor @xmath285 ) , while @xmath282 varies weakly with @xmath2 ( by a factor @xmath286 ) ; feedback evidently self - adjusts in these models so as to maintain a state of marginal gravitational instability .      in a self - gravitating system that approaches a statistical steady state",
    ", the virial theorem predicts that the specific kinetic and gravitational energies @xmath287 and @xmath288 will be related by @xmath289 ; this is modified when magnetic terms are present @xcite .",
    "classically , the virial theorem has often been assumed to hold within individual gmcs in order to obtain estimates of their masses , and indeed this yields values that are consistent ( within a factor @xmath290 ) with other measures of the mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if individual gmcs are short - lived , however , they may not satisfy the virial theorem because the moment of inertia tensor is changing rapidly enough , and/or surface terms are large enough , to be comparable to the kinetic and gravitational energy integrated over the cloud volume .",
    "when averaged over an ensemble of clouds , there will be ( partial ) cancellation of surface and time - dependent terms , as they appear with opposite signs for forming and dispersing clouds .",
    "an added complication is that self - gravitating gmcs form out of diffuse gas , and when they are destroyed ( whether after a short or long time ) they return to diffuse gas ; thus the different terms in the virial theorem may be observed in different tracers depending on whether diffuse gas is primarily atomic or molecular .    here",
    ", we consider virial ratios @xmath291 separately for each component of the gas in our models .",
    "the term @xmath287 includes both thermal and bulk kinetic energy , computed via a space - time average as : @xmath292 and for @xmath288 only the perturbed gravitational potential is used in computing the space - time averaged value of the energy : @xmath293 as for the other statistical properties we have considered , we measure @xmath294 separately for each component ( separated into density bins ) of the system .",
    "figure [ fig : virial1 ] shows the virial ratio of each component , for all models in all series .",
    "note that @xmath295 and @xmath296 imply gravitationally bound and unbound states , respectively for any component .",
    "as we do not separate the contributions to the potential from the different density ranges , a given component may be bound within a potential well that is created by more than one component .",
    "strictly speaking , the factor 1/2 in equation ( [ eq : wdef ] ) applies only for self - potentials .",
    "as expected , the lowest - density wnm component ( @xmath297 ) has @xmath294 very large ( above 100 ) , and the intermediate - density cnm component ( @xmath298 ) also is non - self - gravitating , with @xmath299 in the range @xmath300 .",
    "the hii ( photoheated ) component generally has values of @xmath301 , similar to that of the cnm component .",
    "although it has very large thermal energy ( much greater than the cnm ) , the photoheated gas by definition resides within deep parts of the gravitational potential well .",
    "the two dense components , dm2 ( @xmath302 ) and dm3 ( @xmath303 ) , on the other hand , are consistent with being marginally or strongly gravitationally bound , with @xmath304 and @xmath305 , respectively . for the majority of models ,",
    "the value of @xmath299 for the densest component , dm3 , is quite near unity , indicating consistency with virial equilibrium for the component as a whole .",
    "for a few models , @xmath299 is as low as 0.3 for the dm3 component ; this indicates that the dense gas is transient , with dense regions being rapidly dispersed into lower - density gas by the feedback process .",
    "overall , we find no significant differences in the trends for @xmath299 between different series or different models within any series .",
    "there is a weak correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath299 , with lower-@xmath5 ( more unstable ) models having slightly higher virial ratios .",
    "although the ism consists of many phases at different densities , all of this gas resides within a common potential well which tends to confine material near the galactic midplane .",
    "the scale height of each phase depends on the support provided by thermal and kinetic pressure ( plus support by magnetic stresses and cosmic rays , although these may be less significant ) . in @xcite",
    "we consider in detail the vertical distribution of gas within our models , and show that vertical equilibrium is a good approximation for the system as a whole , provided that appropriate accounting is made for the differing velocity dispersions of different components .",
    "we also discuss dependence of the mean scale height on model parameters .    for the purpose of assessing gravitational timescales of the overall ism system , it is useful to measure the density when averaged over large scales ( i.e. a volume at least comparable to the scale height ) .",
    "to evaluate this volume average in our models , we first compute the vertical scale height , defined using the following averaging : @xmath306 where @xmath22 is the vertical coordinate relative to the midplane .",
    "we further average the values of @xmath307 over time . for a gaussian density profile , @xmath308 ,",
    "the midplane density is related to the surface density and scale height by @xmath309 , and the mass - weighted mean value of the average density is given by @xmath310 .",
    "we therefore define an average density in our models as : @xmath311 ( see also appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rave ] shows the vertically - averaged density for all models in all series . in general , we find that the average density increases with the total surface density of gas in the disk . a slightly shallower increase of @xmath312 with @xmath2 is obtained in series k compared to series q , which can be attributed to the large velocity dispersions in strongly unstable ( small @xmath5 ) disk models .",
    "series r also has a shallower slope than in series q , because the stellar gravity does not increase at large @xmath2 in the former . for reference ,",
    "we also plot in figure [ fig : rave ] the values of the vertically - averaged density from our comparison hydrostatic model series .",
    "the slope of series hsc ( lower - left panel ) is shallower than that in series hsp ( top panels ) , again because the stellar density does not increasingly compress the gas at large @xmath2 in series hsc .",
    "the volume - averaged densities of the dynamic models are lower than those of the hydrostatic models by up to an order of magnitude ; the difference increases at large surface density where turbulence plays an increasingly important role ( see also @xcite ) .    using the mean density and the definition of the free - fall time , @xmath313 we can calculate the free - fall time for the system as a whole , @xmath314 . since @xmath312 increases with @xmath2 in our models , @xmath314 will decrease with increasing @xmath2 . because star formation requires gas to become self - gravitating",
    ", a widespread notion is that the star formation timescale , when averaged over large scales in a galaxy , will be proportional to the large - scale average of @xmath315 , i.e. @xmath314 . since star formation takes place within gmcs that have much higher density than the mean value in the ism , the conditions that control star formation where it actually takes place are not those of the large - scale ism .",
    "thus , implicit in the notion that star formation times should be related to the large - scale mean @xmath314 is the idea that the formation of gmcs ( on timescales closer to @xmath314 ) is the principal means of regulating star formation .",
    "if the star formation efficiency per gmc is constant , then the gmc formation rate would control the star formation rate .",
    "alternatively , the star formation rate might be related to the large - scale @xmath316 if the densities within gmcs are proportional to the large - scale mean densities of the ism , @xmath317 .",
    "another important dynamical timescale in disk galaxies is the orbital time , @xmath318 .",
    "growth of large - scale self - gravitating perturbations in disks in fact occurs at timescales longer than @xmath314 ( provided pressure limits small - scale collapse ) , and more comparable to @xmath318 .",
    "observations @xcite show that empirically - measured star formation timescales in disk galaxies tend to be correlated with the orbital time , with @xmath319 of gas being converted to stars per galactic orbit .",
    "it is useful to compare @xmath314 with @xmath320 in our models .",
    "figure [ fig : tfftorb ] shows the ratio of @xmath321 for all hydrodynamic and hydrostatic series . for the hydrodynamic series , the typical ratio is @xmath322 ; for the hydrostatic models , the densities are much higher at large @xmath2 so that @xmath323 . for series q and r , the ratio @xmath324 varies relatively weakly with @xmath2 , and lies in the range @xmath325 .",
    "the comparison hydrostatic models for these series also show @xmath324 varying only modestly with @xmath2 . for these series , @xmath326 .",
    "since turbulent velocity dispersions do not depend strongly on @xmath2 for series q and r , @xmath312 does not strongly depart from a scaling @xmath327 , yielding behavior similar to @xmath328 .",
    "interestingly , the k series , which has constant @xmath329 , shows a smaller range of @xmath312 than the q series .",
    "this is indicative of self - regulation : high feedback activity in the highest-@xmath2 models of series k yield high turbulent amplitudes , which lead to lower values of @xmath312 . as a consequence ,",
    "the ratios of @xmath330 are more modulated in the hydrodynamic models for series k than in the corresponding hydrostatic series .",
    "in the present work , we do not explicitly follow star formation . nevertheless , it is interesting to explore the consequences of our statistical results , within the context of recipes that are commonly adopted for star formation in numerical models .",
    "we compare estimates of the implied star formation timescale both to observations and to various fiducial dynamical times .",
    "a common practice in numerical simulations of galactic evolution is to assume that the star formation rate per unit volume ( in a computational region ) is proportional to the gas density per unit volume divided by the free - fall time at that density .",
    "when a minimum density threshold for star formation is imposed , the total star formation rate ( sfr , in mass of new stars per unit time ) takes the form @xmath331 provided that the density pdf decreases above the threshold , so that most of the star forming activity is in gas near @xmath332 . here",
    ", the star formation efficiency per free - fall time , @xmath333 , is an arbitrary constant parameter that is adopted , generally by comparing to observations . in practice ,",
    "the parameter @xmath333 in this sort of recipe enfolds many different effects that limit star formation compared to the fastest possible rate . within gmcs ,",
    "turbulence and magnetic fields limit the rate of core formation and collapse , and feedback from star formation limits gmc lifetimes ; at larger scales , dynamical processes in the diffuse ism limit gmc formation . depending on the value of the threshold density , either more ( low @xmath332 ) or fewer ( high @xmath332 ) processes",
    "are implicitly packaged in the single efficiency parameter @xmath333 .    for a given star formation rate ,",
    "the star formation timescale is defined by dividing the total gas mass by the total sfr , @xmath334 : @xmath335 the latter expression uses the mass fraction @xmath35 as defined in equation ( [ eq : fraction ] ) ; @xmath336 is the total gas mass .",
    "because @xmath35 and @xmath337 are , by definition , less than 1 , the star formation time always exceeds the free - fall time at the threshold density . since the efficiency per free - fall time is arbitrary ( from the point of view of simulations )",
    ", it is convenient to introduce @xmath338 such that @xmath339 .",
    "this scaled star formation time then depends only on the choice of density threshold and the fraction of the total gas mass above this threshold .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "the density threshold for star formation is an arbitrary parameter ; what difference does the choice of this value make to the resulting sfr ? to address this question , we first compare values of @xmath340 using two different thresholds , @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "both threshold values are large enough that the gas at these densities is in gravitationally - bound structures , based on the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : virial1 ] . figure [ fig : tsf ] shows the values of the scaled star formation time , @xmath340 , for all models . for our chosen density thresholds , @xmath340 is in the range @xmath343 yr for all models .",
    "the true star formation time , @xmath344 , exceeds @xmath340 by a factor @xmath345 ; the value of @xmath333 must then be quite small ( @xmath346 ) for @xmath344 to be @xmath347 yr . also , since @xmath340 is larger for the threshold choice @xmath341 than @xmath342 , the value of @xmath333 would have to be smaller for the higher density threshold , in order to yield the same value of @xmath344 at a given @xmath2 .",
    "note , however , that while the thresholds differ by a factor 10 , the values of @xmath340 ( and hence required @xmath348 ) differ by less than a factor 2 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath35 decreases with increasing @xmath34 ; between @xmath341 and @xmath342 , our results imply a dependence @xmath349 with the range of @xmath350 .",
    "alternatively , we can think of our results requiring a choice for @xmath351 with the range of @xmath352 in order for the sfr to be independent of the choice of threshold at high densities .",
    "other aspects of the results shown in figure [ fig : tsf ] are also interesting .",
    "first , it is evident that @xmath340 depends only weakly on both surface density ( series q , k , r ) and angular velocity ( series s ) . for series q and s , @xmath340 decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the hydrostatic models show a similar range of @xmath340 to the dynamic , turbulent models .",
    "the fact that @xmath340 is not strongly sensitive to environmental conditions ( total available gas content , local shear rate , level of turbulence , etc . ) may help to explain why empirical sfrs show such a regular character in observed galaxies , in spite of widely - varying local conditions .",
    "conversely , the insensitivity of @xmath340 to conditions within a model has implications for evaluating theoretical results : successfully reproducing levels of star formation similar to observations is not a critical discriminant of how well a simulated galaxy resembles a real system .",
    "our hydrostatic models bear minimal resemblance to real galaxies , yet for a choice of @xmath353 consistent with observed efficiencies in co - emitting gas in gmcs ( which have densities in the range @xmath354 ) , the resulting star formation times are @xmath355 yr , similar to the observed range of @xmath344 for @xmath2 comparable to the range in our models .    to connect more directly to the way observed sfrs are normally presented , in figure [ fig : sfr ] we show results for scaled surface density of star formation as a function of surface density of gas ( series q , k , r ) and angular velocity ( series s ) .",
    "the scaled sfr per unit area is defined as @xmath356 , where the sfr is taken to follow @xmath357 as before , we compare results based on two different threshold density choices , and also show the results from hydrostatic models .",
    "observations are typically fitted to power laws of the form @xmath358 . for reference",
    ", we show slopes with @xmath359 and @xmath360 . for each model series and each value of @xmath332 ,",
    "we fit a power - law index .",

    "for the hydrostatic cases , the indices are 1.38 ( series hsp ) and 1.39 ( series hsc ) at @xmath363 . as we shall discuss further in  [ summary ] , these results are similar to the observed ranges of power - law indices that have been reported .",
    "we note that series q and r show more regular behavior than series k. this reflects the different environmental parameters that are inputs to the models : in series k , the epicyclic frequency is held constant , while in series q and r we adopt a scaling @xmath364 . for @xmath365 , both the magnitude and scaling of the @xmath8 vs. @xmath2 results in series q and r",
    "are similar to observations .",
    "in  [ sec : sfr ] , we investigated the relationship between the mean large - scale surface density @xmath2 and the star formation time based on the amount of high - density gas ( at @xmath366 within a zone ) .",
    "this gas may be considered immediately eligible for star formation , since it is cold and found in self - gravitating systems . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : rhoave ] , if formation of massive , cold , gravitationally bound systems is the principal throttle for star formation , then star formation times would also be expected to vary with the timescales for gmc formation .",
    "gmc formation is a complex process , and to date no simple formula has been obtained for the formation rate . instead , several different `` large - scale '' dynamical times are commonly invoked to obtain estimates of the gmc formation time .",
    "these include the free - fall time at the large - scale mean density , @xmath314 , the jeans time based on the surface density and the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath367 , and the orbital time @xmath320 , which is generally related to the epicyclic and shear times .",
    "it is interesting to explore how our measurement of @xmath340 compares to each of these times , as a function of the independent parameter in each series .",
    "we begin with the orbital time , @xmath368 .",
    "figure [ fig : tsftorb ] shows the ratio between @xmath369 ( for the two different density thresholds @xmath332 ) and the orbital time . in series",
    "k , @xmath2 is the independent parameter , but @xmath320 is independent of @xmath2 ; thus the ratio is simply a rescaled version of @xmath340 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsf ] . in series q and r",
    ", the independent parameter is @xmath2 , and @xmath370 , so @xmath371 . in series",
    "s , @xmath320 is the independent parameter . although the variation with the independent parameter is moderate in all the series , the ratio is not constant , and for some series shows secular trends .",
    "namely , for series q and r , which showed a trend of decreasing @xmath372 at increasing @xmath2 , @xmath373 increases at larger @xmath2 .",
    "thus , assuming that the star formation time is @xmath374 would increasingly overestimate the true star formation rate ( presumed to depend on the amount of dense gas ) as @xmath2 increases .",
    "we next consider the jeans time for a disk , @xmath375 , where @xmath376 is either the thermal or the total ( radial ) turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath199 or @xmath377 .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath378 is given by @xmath379 , where the toomre parameter @xmath5 is either based on mean sound speed or the total velocity dispersion ( see  [ sec : toomre ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tsftj ] shows the ratio between @xmath340 and the jeans time , using the total velocity dispersion . again , strong secular trends with @xmath2 are evident ; @xmath380 is not a good predictor of the star formation time .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : tsftff ] we show the ratio between @xmath340 and and the free fall time at the vertically - averaged large - scale mean density (  [ sec : rhoave ] ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : tfftorb ] ) .",
    "although the values of this ratio are closer to unity than @xmath373 and @xmath381 , we still see that @xmath382 is not constant as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "when we compare @xmath383 to the scaled star formation rates based on high density gas shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sfr ] ) , we find a steeper rise with @xmath2 , close to @xmath327 in series q and r and slightly shallower in series k.    if star formation is regulated by the collection of diffuse gas into self - gravitating regions , then strictly speaking one would expect specific star formation rates to vary proportional to the fraction of diffuse gas divided by the gmc formation time ( estimated just including the diffuse gas ) .",
    "the above comparisons between @xmath340 and timescale estimates based on mean large - scale properties can be corrected to account for this , yielding the ratios @xmath384 , @xmath385 , and @xmath386 .",
    "we find , however , that these ratios also are non - constant in any series , although the correction factor does tend to flatten out the secular rise with increasing @xmath2 in the comparison to the free - fall time .",
    "taking all of our results together , we conclude that several commonly - used estimates for galactic star formation timescales based on large - scale mean galactic properties may have only limited utility for making detailed predictions of star formation rates",
    ". that is , the orbital time , the jeans time , and the free - fall time based on the vertically - averaged density are not proportional to the star formation time based on the amount of dense , gravitationally bound gas that is present .",
    "simulations with insufficient resolution or limited physics may therefore not be able to provide accurate predictions of star formation rates , if they do not capture processes at small enough scales to represent dense , gravitationally - bound structures .",
    "we have developed a numerical hydrodynamic code to study the life - cycle of multiphase , turbulent interstellar gas in disk galaxies ; our model includes gas self - gravity , the vertical gravity associated with a fixed stellar disk , radiative cooling and heating in the temperature range of @xmath387 , sheared rotation in the background galactic potential ( we adopt a flat galactic rotation curve ) , and a prescription for feedback in the form of hii regions that originate within massive , dense clouds .",
    "our simulation domains represent slices in the radial - vertical plane of a galactic disk .",
    "we focus on scales large enough to include vertical stratification ( @xmath65 up to 410 pc ) and significant shear of the disk angular velocity ( @xmath388 up to 1.6 kpc ) , but small enough to resolve sub - structure within dense , self - gravitating clouds that form ( typical zone resolution is @xmath0pc ) .",
    "our models are 2.5-dimensional , in the sense that all three components of the velocity are time - dependent functions .",
    "for feedback to occur , we impose thresholds on both the local volume density and on the gravitational potential , so that hii regions only occur within massive clouds ( consistent with observations ) .",
    "the expansion of hii regions drives turbulence in all the components of the gas .",

    "we vary @xmath2 and @xmath4 together while holding @xmath3 fixed .",
    "finally , in series s the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are held constant while @xmath4 is varied .",
    "our main conclusions , and their relation to other recent work , are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "_ density , temperature , and pressure distributions _",
    "we find that in spite of time - dependent effects , the density and temperature distributions of the gas retain bimodal profiles reminiscent of the classical @xcite two - phase model of the ism .",
    "although large - amplitude turbulence heats and cools via @xmath389 work and entropy production in shocks , most of the gas ( by mass ) remains near the curve in the pressure - density phase plane that is defined by radiative equilibrium : @xmath390 .",
    "this is possible because the cooling time is generally shorter than the turbulent dynamical times , for our models .",
    "if turbulent compressions or expansions were more extreme in magnitude and also rapid in time compared to radiative times , then these adiabatic changes would lead to density - temperature pairs that more strongly departed from thermal equilibrium ( see e.g. for a discussion of the dependence on various physical timescales involved ) .",
    ", @xcite , and @xcite similarly found that even with large - amplitude turbulence  and no direct heating of the gas  mass - weighted density and temperature pdfs",
    "have two ( broadened ) peaks , although for very high amplitude turbulence the trough tends to fill in ( e.g. ) .",
    "@xcite have emphasized the importance of maintaining sufficient numerical resolution , as numerical diffusion associated with flow across the grid broadens warm / cold interfaces , populating the thermally - unstable regime in the phase diagram .",
    "we note that bimodal character is most easily seen in mass - weighted rather than volume - weighted pdfs , although many of the results in the literature show only volume - weighted pdfs .",
    "our results on the bimodal thermal distribution of gas are consistent with observations of atomic hi in the midplane of the milky way @xcite , which at the same time show interesting evidence of out - of - equilibrium gas , particularly at high latitudes .",
    "_ turbulence _",
    "we find that appreciable turbulence can be excited in all components of the gas .",
    "the values of the velocity dispersion in dense gas ( @xmath391 ) of @xmath392 are similar to , though slightly lower than , those observed in milky way and other local - group gmcs ( e.g. @xcite ) . for lower - density gas in our models , velocity dispersions are slightly higher , but still lower by a factor two compared to observed velocity dispersions of @xmath393 of solar - neighborhood warm and cold hi seen in 21 cm emission and absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not surprising that the turbulence levels in our simulations are only moderate , given that we have included only one of the many sources of turbulence that is present in the ism .",
    "turbulent driving in the ism has been reviewed by e.g. .",
    "supernova are widely - believed to be the most important source of turbulence for diffuse gas , and this has been demonstrated by numerical simulations . in the outer galaxy where star formation rates are low , driving by the magnetorotational instability may , however , dominate @xcite .",
    "spiral shocks are also effective in driving turbulence in the warm ism , especially at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "the interaction between large - scale self - gravity , rotation , and shear can drive near - sonic turbulence at large scales @xcite , although the amplitude of this at scales less than the disk scale height may be modest .",
    "it is not known how effective these other mechanisms are for driving turbulence within gmcs , however , which are very dense and therefore present a small effective crossection to the diffuse ism .",
    "\\3 . _ feedback and the toomre @xmath5 parameter _",
    "we have measured the toomre parameter for each of our models , considering both the entire medium and just the dense gas , and comparing `` thermal - only '' with `` turbulent+thermal '' values .",
    "for all models , we find that the `` turbulent+thermal '' @xmath5-value for dense gas is in the range @xmath394 , and is much greater than the thermal - only value .",
    "a further interesting point is that the turbulence level evidently adjusts with surface density in order to reach a marginally - stable state . in series q and r , which have @xmath395 , the velocity dispersions are relatively independent of @xmath2 , yielding marginally - stable @xmath5 in the cold , dense gas . in series",
    "k , which has constant @xmath4 and therefore is highly unstable at large @xmath2 in the absence of turbulence , the velocity dispersions strongly increase with @xmath2 , as a consequence of much higher levels of feedback activity .",
    "these higher velocity dispersions lift @xmath5 to near unity .",
    "thus , our simulations give direct evidence of feedback leading to a self - regulated quasi - steady state .",
    "we note that @xmath5 values vary for different components ; @xcite similarly found a large range of @xmath5 when measured in local patches within their disk simulations .",
    "depending on what exactly is included in a model , the threshold for gravitational instability in previous non - turbulent simulations is measured to be at @xmath396 ( see ) , which is similar to the values we find here when turbulence is included in @xmath5 . in the actively - star - forming regions of galaxies , measured values of the toomre parameter",
    "are not constant , but show a limited range @xcite .",
    "evidence for star formation thresholds tied to @xmath5 are more mixed @xcite , possibly because star formation in outer disks primarily takes place in spiral arms @xcite which strongly compress the gas above ambient densities .",
    "\\4 . _ the virial ratio _",
    "we measure the virial ratio @xmath294 ( eq . [ eq : vir ] ) for all our models , separating into different density regimes .",
    "we find that dense gas ( @xmath397 ) generally has @xmath294 between @xmath398 , whereas lower - density gas has large values of @xmath294 .",
    "@xmath294 does not vary strongly with @xmath2 in any of the series .",
    "in particular , we note that in spite of the large range of velocity dispersions in the dense gas in series k at different @xmath2 , @xmath294 varies only weakly with @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that feedback can effectively regulate the dynamics within massive , dense clouds , independent of the larger - scale galactic environment .",
    "this is consistent with both older studies based on @xmath399co observations @xcite , and recent studies based on @xmath400co observations @xcite , both of which find @xmath294 near @xmath394 for milky way gmcs .",
    "although masses based on co are less certain in external galaxies , virial ratios also likely near unity for gmcs observed in the local group @xcite    \\5 .",
    "_ cloud surface densities _",
    "we estimate the surface density of typical clouds by measuring the mass - weighted vertically - integrated column of gas ; we define this as @xmath246 . for the values of the feedback threshold that we adopt , we find that @xmath246 is in the range @xmath401 for most models .",
    "this is comparable to the typical gmc surface densities that are observed in the milky way and in local group galaxies @xcite .",
    "whether observational selection effects or physical processes impose a limited range of column densities for gmcs is an open question .",
    "for example , magnetic fields may impose a minimum surface density for formation of gravitationally - bound structures in the ism , at a value @xmath402 . here",
    ", we find that altering the volume heated in our hii region prescription does not appreciably change @xmath246 , but changing the gravitational potential threshold for star formation feedback does : when potential thresholds are low , @xmath254 is also low .",
    "comparison of cloud properties with observations may turn out to be a much more critical test of whether an ism model is realistic than some other measures , such as the star formation rate .",
    "_ dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath2 _",
    "we obtain estimates of the dependence of surface star formation rate @xmath8 on gas surface density @xmath2 in our models by assuming that the timescale for star formation is proportional to the free - fall time in gas above some density threshold @xmath403 .",
    "we compare results for two different threshold densities , @xmath404 and @xmath405 . for series q and r ( which most resemble real galaxies ) , we find ( for either choice of threshold ) relations that are well - described by power laws : @xmath406 with @xmath407 . in series",
    "k , a power law is a less - good fit ; the slope is also shallower ( closer to unity ) .",
    "these results are consistent with empirical kennicutt - schmidt laws , which show similar values of @xmath361 when all the gas is included in @xmath2 ( e.g. ) .",
    "recent work has suggested that @xmath361 is close to unity if just co - emitting molecular gas is included @xcite ; this implies all co - emitting gas ( most of which is at @xmath408 ) has the same star formation rate independent of galactic environment .",
    "our prescription that the star formation rate per unit mass of dense gas is constant is equivalent to empirically finding @xmath359 if only molecular gas is included .",
    "it is encouraging that the results we find for kennicutt - schmidt relations in our disk models with feedback are compatible with observations .",
    "we also find , however , that star formation rates predicted from hydrostatic models are in fact similar to those predicted from the hydrodynamic models , with similar slopes at large @xmath2 .",
    "this is true even though the hydrostatic models are not at all like real galaxies .",
    "thus , one must be cautious in considering a numerical model successful if it yields reasonable star formation rates , since this can simply be a consequence of choosing reasonable initial conditions in a simulation .",
    "indeed , a number of recent numerical studies have found results similar to observed kennicutt - schmidt laws , regardless of the detailed physics that they included in the models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have also recently emphasized that reproducing empirical star formation scaling laws is not by itself a critical test of an ism model .",
    "_ density - dependence of star formation efficiency _",
    "the star formation efficiency per free - fall time can be defined locally as a function of threshold density by @xmath409 ; corresponding global measures can also be obtained .",
    "for a given true star formation rate , @xmath410 where the scaled star formation time @xmath340 is shown for two different threshold densities in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsf ] .",
    "we find that @xmath340 ( or @xmath333 ) decreases with increasing @xmath332 .",
    "this is not a strong effect , however : it is less than a factor 2 for an order of magnitude difference in @xmath332 . in series q and r , the ratio of efficiencies at different threshold densities are also independent of @xmath2 ( although this is not true for series k ) .",
    "@xcite recently compiled a range of observations of @xmath337 ( which they refer to as sfr@xmath411 ) .",
    "they point out that for threshold densities above @xmath412 , the value of @xmath337 does not vary strongly with density .",
    "they also find a smaller value for gas traced by hcn than for gas traced by co , which since hcn has a higher critical density than co is consistent with our finding that @xmath337 decreases with increasing @xmath332 .    even though scaled star formation times at high density vary together independent of @xmath2 , the free - fall time at the vertically - averaged density is _ not _ proportional to @xmath340 .",
    "instead , we find that @xmath413 increases at increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that a prescription for star formation based on the mean density within one `` average '' scale height in a disk ( or from a simulation that does not resolve high - density gas ) would increasingly overestimate the star formation rate at high @xmath2 .",
    "the same is true for the orbital time and the jeans time : an assumption that the star formation rate varies @xmath414 or @xmath415 would increasingly overestimate @xmath8 at high @xmath2 compared to the value obtained from measuring the mass of gas in dense , gravitationally - bound regions .",
    "thus , ism models must resolve self - gravitating structures at scales less than the disk thickness in order to make accurate predictions of the star formation rate .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for a thorough reading and thoughtful set of comments that have helped us to clarify our presentation .",

    "in this section , we provide details for our method of solving poisson s equation in cartesian disk geometry .",
    "we generalize to the three - dimensional case .",
    "thus , the solution is applicable to problems in which periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal ( x - y ) directions are assumed , and vacuum boundary conditions are required in the vertical ( z ) direction . following binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and @xcite , the gravitational potential at the location @xmath416 on a regular cartesian grid with dimensions @xmath417 for integer indices @xmath418 can be written as @xmath419 here @xmath420 is the green function of the poisson equation for a horizontal sheet sinusoidal source charge and is written as @xmath421 where @xmath422^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that up to a constant , the @xmath423 solution is equal to the limit of the general solution for @xmath424 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath425 are given by the discrete fourier transforms of the density in the horizontal plane @xmath426 , i.e. , @xmath427 since @xmath428 in the green function takes on values between @xmath429 and @xmath65 , we can apply fourier transforms on the domain @xmath430 to obtain @xmath431 where @xmath432 substitution of equation ( [ eq : green ] ) and evaluation of the sum shows that @xmath433 if we now substitute into the original expression for @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath434 where @xmath435 and @xmath436 here , @xmath437 that is , in addition to using the horizontal fourier components of the original domain , we must define an image density in the augmented domain , based on the @xmath438 values a distance @xmath65 away .",
    "after the corrected density is defined , a fourier transform in @xmath22 is taken in the usual way .",
    "the complete procedure for obtaining the gravitational potential is therefore as follows : first compute two - dimensional ( @xmath439 ) fourier components for each horizontal layer in @xmath22 .",

    "<S> we focus on effects of hii regions by implementing a recipe for intense heating confined within dense , self - gravitating regions . </S>",
    "<S> our models are two - dimensional , representing radial - vertical slices through the disk , and include sheared background rotation of the gas , vertical stratification , heating and cooling to yield temperatures @xmath1 , and conduction that resolves thermal instabilities on our numerical grid . </S>",
    "<S> each simulation evolves to reach a quasi - steady state , for which we analyze the time - averaged properties of the gas . in our suite of models , </S>",
    "<S> three parameters ( the gas surface density @xmath2 , the stellar volume density @xmath3 , and the local angular rotation rate @xmath4 ) are separately controlled in order to explore environmental dependencies . among other statistical measures , </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate turbulent amplitudes , virial ratios , toomre @xmath5 parameters including turbulence , and the mass fractions at different densities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dense gas ( @xmath6 ) has turbulence levels similar to those observed in giant molecular clouds and virial ratios @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our models show that the toomre @xmath5 parameter in the dense gas evolves to values near unity ; this demonstrates self - regulation via turbulent feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we also test how the star formation rate @xmath8 depends on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . under the assumption that the star formation rate is proportional to the amount of gas at densities above a threshold @xmath9 divided by the free - fall time at that threshold </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath10 with @xmath11 when @xmath12 or @xmath13 , consistent with observed kennicutt - schmidt relations . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of star formation rates based on large - scale properties ( the orbital time , the jeans time , or the free - fall time at the mean density within a scale height ) , however , depart from rates computed using the measured amount of dense gas , indicating that resolving the ism structure in galactic disks is necessary to obtain accurate predictions of the star formation rate . </S>"
