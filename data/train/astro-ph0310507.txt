    "diffusive acceleration at newtonian shock fronts is an extensively studied phenomenon .",
    "detailed discussions of the current status of the investigations can be found in some recent excellent reviews @xcite . while much is by",
    "now well understood , some issues are still subjects of much debate , for the theoretical and phenomenological implications that they may have .",
    "the most important of these is the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock : the violation of the _ test particle approximation _ occurs when the acceleration process becomes sufficiently efficient to generate pressures of the accelerated particles which are comparable with the incoming gas kinetic pressure .",
    "both the spectrum of the particles and the structure of the shock are changed by this phenomenon , which is therefore intrinsically nonlinear .    at present",
    "there are three viable approaches to account for the backreaction of the particles upon the shock : one is based on the ever - improving numerical simulations @xcite that allow a self - consistent treatment of several effects .",
    "the second approach is a _ fluid _ approach , and treats cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid .",
    "this class of models was proposed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "these models allow one to obtain the thermodynamics of the modified shocks , but do not provide information about the spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "the third approach is analytical and may be very helpful to understand the physics of the nonlinear effects in a way that sometimes is difficult to achieve through simulations , due to their intrinsic complexity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a perturbative approach was adopted , in which the pressure of accelerated particles was treated as a small perturbation . by construction",
    "this method provides an answer only for weakly modified shocks .",
    "an alternative approach was proposed in @xcite , based on the assumption that the diffusion of the particles is sufficiently energy dependent that different parts of the fluid are affected by particles with different average energies .",
    "the way the calculations are carried out implies a sort of separate solution of the transport equation for subrelativistic and relativistic particles , so that the two spectra must be somehow connected at @xmath0 _ a posteriori_.    recently , in @xcite , the effects of the non - linear backreaction of accelerated particles on the maximum achievable energy were investigated , together with the effects of geometry .",
    "the maximum energy of the particles accelerated in supernova remnants in the presence of large acceleration efficiencies was also studied in @xcite .",
    "the need for a _",
    "practical _ solution of the acceleration problem in the non - linear regime was recognized in @xcite , where a simple analytical broken - power - law approximation of the non - linear spectra was presented .",
    "recently , some promising analytical solutions of the problem of non - linear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "these solutions seem to avoid many of the limitations of previous approaches .",
    "numerical simulations have been instrumental to identify the dramatic effects of the particles backreaction : they showed that even when the fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas is relatively small , the energy channelled into these few particles can be an appreciable part of the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid , making the test particle approach unsuitable .",
    "the most visible effects of the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock appear in the spectrum of the accelerated particles , which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies .",
    "the analytical approaches reproduce well the basic features arising from nonlinear effects in shock acceleration .",
    "while several calculations exist of the nonlinear effects in the shock acceleration of quasi - monochromatic particles injected at a shock surface , there is no description at present of how these effects appear , if they do , when the shock propagates in a medium where ( pre)accelerated particles already exist .",
    "the linear theory of this phenomenon was developed by bell @xcite , but has never been generalized to its nonlinear extension .",
    "in fact , the backreaction can severely affect the process of re - energization of preaccelerated particles : bell already showed that for strong shocks the energy content of a region where cosmic rays were present could be easily enhanced by a factor @xmath1 at each shock passage , so that equipartition could be readily reached . in these conditions the backreaction of the accelerated particles should be expected .",
    "we report here on the first analytical treatment of the shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles , with the inclusion of their nonlinear backreaction on the shock .",
    "our approach is a generalization of the analytical method introduced in @xcite to describe the nonlinear shock acceleration with monochromatic injection of quasi - thermal particles .",
    "in fact , we present here also a general calculation that accounts for both thermal particles and seed nonthermal particles .",
    "this case may be of interest for the study of supernova shocks propagating through the interstellar medium ( ism ) where pressure balance exists between gas and cosmic rays .",
    "nonlinear effects in shock acceleration of thermal particles result in the appearance of multiple solutions in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "this behaviour resembles that of critical systems , with a bifurcation occurring when some threshold is reached . in the case of shock acceleration",
    ", it is not easy to find a way of discriminating among the multiple solutions when they appear .",
    "neverthless , in @xcite , a two fluid approach has been used to demonstrate that when three solutions appear , the one with intermediate efficiency for particle acceleration is unstable to corrugations in the shock structure and emission of acustic waves .",
    "plausibility arguments may be put forward to justify that the system made of the shock plus the accelerated particles may sit at the critical point , but the author is not aware of any real proof that this is what happens .",
    "the physical parameters that play a role in this approach to criticality are the maximum momentum achievable by the particles in the acceleration process , the mach number of the shock , and the injection efficiency , namely the fraction of thermal particles crossing the shock that are accelerated to nonthermal energies .",
    "the last of them , the injection efficiency , hides a crucial physics problem by itself , and may play an important role in establishing the level of shock modification .",
    "this efficiency parameter in reality is defined by the microphysics of the shock and should not be a free parameter of the problem .",
    "unfortunately , our poor knowledge of such microphysics , in particular for collisionless shocks , does not allow us to establish a clear and universal connection between the injection efficiency and the macroscopic shock properties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : nonlin ] we describe the effect of non linearity on shock acceleration and our mathematical approach to describe it . in particular",
    "we generalize previous calculations to the case in which seed particles exist in the region where the shock is propagating ; in  [ sec : gasdyn ] we describe the gas dynamics in the presence of a non - negligible pressure of accelerated particles . in  [ sec : results ] we describe our results , with particular attention for the onset of the particle backreaction and for the appearance of multiple solutions .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we solve the diffusion - convection equation for the cosmic rays in the most general case in which particles are injected according to some function @xmath2 and the shock propagates within a region where some cosmic ray distribution exists , that we denote as @xmath3 , spatially homogeneous before the shock crossing ( upstream ) .    for simplicity",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of one - dimensional shocks , but the introduction of different geometrical effects is relatively simple , and in fact many of our conclusions should not be affected by geometry .",
    "the equation that describes the diffusive transport of particles in one dimension is @xmath4 -   u   \\frac{\\partial f ( x , p)}{\\partial x } + \\frac{1}{3 }    \\frac{d u}{d x}~p~\\frac{\\partial f(x , p)}{\\partial p } +   q(x , p ) = 0 , \\label{eq : trans}\\ ] ] where we assumed stationarity ( @xmath5 ) . the @xmath6 axis is oriented from upstream to downstream , as in fig .",
    "the presence of pre - existing cosmic rays is introduced as a boundary condition at upstream infinity , by requiring that @xmath7 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the common picture of a fluid whose speed is constant ( @xmath8 ) until it hits the shock surface is not appropriate for modified shocks .",
    "in fact , in this case , the pressure of the accelerated particles may become large enough to slow down the fluid before it crosses the shock surface .",
    "therefore in general at upstream infinity the gas flows at speed @xmath9 , different from @xmath8 ( fluid speed immediately upstream of the shock ) .",
    "the two quantities are approximately equal only when the accelerated particles do not have dynamical relevance .",
    "the injection term is taken in the form @xmath10 .    as a first step ,",
    "we integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : trans ] around @xmath11 , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , denoted in fig . 1 as points `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' respectively , so that the following equation can be written : @xmath14_2 - \\left [ d \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial",

    "the function @xmath20 is the average fluid velocity experienced by particles with momentum @xmath22 while diffusing upstream away from the shock surface .",
    "in other words , the effect of the average is that , instead of a constant speed @xmath8 upstream , a particle with momentum @xmath22 experiences a spatially variable speed , due to the pressure of the accelerated particles that is slowing down the fluid . since the diffusion coefficient is in general @xmath22-dependent , particles with different energies _ feel _ a different compression coefficient , higher at higher energies if , as expected , the diffusion coefficient is an increasing function of momentum .",
    "the role of @xmath20 can also be explained as follows : the distribution function @xmath23 at a distance @xmath6 from the shock surface can be written as @xcite @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the local slope of @xmath26 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 has been assumed independent of the location @xmath6 . in first approximation , we can assume that the exponential factor remains important when it is of order unity , namely when its argument is much less than unity .",

    "note that the diffusion coefficient enters the calculation of the distance @xmath28 but does not enter directly the calculation of @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , different diffusion coefficients may move the point where the fluid speed is @xmath20 closer to or farther from the shock surface , but do not affect the value of @xmath20 .",

    "for a modified shock , @xmath44 can attain values much larger than @xmath45 and more in general , much larger than @xmath46 , which is the maximum value achievable for an ordinary strong non - relativistic shock .",

    "we write and solve these equations in the next section .",
    "the velocity , density and thermodynamic properties of the fluid can be determined by the mass and momentum conservation equations , with the inclusion of the pressure of the accelerated particles and of the preexisting cosmic rays .",

    "our basic assumption , similar to that used in @xcite , is that the diffusion is @xmath22-dependent and more specifically that the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 is an increasing function of @xmath22 .",

    "[ sec : nonlin ] and  [ sec : gasdyn ] to the most general case in which thermal particles are accelerated but seed particles may already be present in the environment .    we start our discussion with the case of acceleration of particles from the thermal distribution , in order to show that the multiple solutions already found in other analytical approaches @xcite are also obtained by adopting the approach illustrated here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noseed ] , we plot the @xmath105 as a function of @xmath44 for the case in which a fraction @xmath39 of the particles ( as indicated in the plots ) crossing the shock is actually accelerated to suprathermal energies .",
    "the mach number is chosen to be @xmath106 and the maximum momentum is taken as @xmath149 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath150 , the value for unmodified shocks , for small values of @xmath39 ( low efficiencies ) , while @xmath44 increases above 4 for @xmath151 .",
    "three solutions appear for intermediate efficiencies , while the solution for the accelerated particles always predicts a strongly modified shock for high efficiencies , @xmath152 .",
    "an asymptotic value of @xmath153 is achieved for the parameters used here .",
    "this example demonstrates that the critical behaviour shown to appear for high values of @xmath39 in several analytical or semi - analytical calculations is in fact also predicted by the approach proposed here .",
    "next question to ask is however whether the presence of seed particles can change the critical behavior of shocks . in order to answer this question",
    "we consider a situation in which particles are accelerated from the thermal pool with efficiency @xmath39 , and at the same time the shock propagates in a medium where the preshock pressure in seed particles equals the gas pressure .",
    "this situation is considered to resemble that of a supernova explosion in our galaxy , where cosmic rays fill the volume remaining in quasi - equipartition with the gas . in order to test the critical structure of the shock",
    "we calculate @xmath105 as a function of the compression factor @xmath44 between upstream infinity and downstream .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : crseed ] .",
    "the lines refer to the cases @xmath154 from bottom to top , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : noseed ] .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the shock may be modified by the backreaction of the accelerated particles even for very low values of @xmath39 , because of the presence of seed particles . in other words ,",
    "the nonlinearity of the shock can well be dominated by the presence of preaccelerated particles rather than by the acceleration of particles from the thermal pool .",
    "clearly this depends however on the values of the parameters ( injection momentum , @xmath39 , maximum momentum achievable , mach number ) .",
    "the injection momentum , in principle , could be related to @xmath39 in order to reduce the number of free parameters of the problem .",
    "this is possible in the assumption that the particles downstream keep a thermal distribution .",
    "simulations suggest that the particles injected in the accelerator are the ones with momentum a few times the thermal momentum of the particles downstream , so that @xmath39 can be simply calculated by integration of the maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution above this minimum momentum .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know whether the particle distribution downstream is in fact maxwell - boltzmann - like .",
    "moreover , we do not know exactly what is the threshold to impose on the injection momentum , which is a delicate issue because the number of particles taking part to the acceleration process would result from the integral of the mb distribution over its exponentially decreasing part",
    ". therefore we preferred here to keep @xmath39 and the injection momentum as separate free parameters .",
    "we proposed a semi - analytical approach to show that the backreaction of particles accelerated at a shock is able to affect the shock itself , in such a way that the shock and the accelerated particles become parts of a nonlinear system .",
    "in particular , for the first time we included in this kind of calculations the seed particles that may be present in the region where the shock is propagating and that can be re - energized by the shock .    while a test - particle approach to this problem was first presented in @xcite , a nonlinear treatment was never investigated . in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was recognized that the energy of the seed particles could be enhanced by about one order of magnitude at each shock passage , and that after an infinite number of strong shocks passing through the region , the spectrum of the particles would tend to the asymptotic spectrum @xmath155 .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , the continuous increase of the cosmic ray energy due to the re - energization of seed particles leads unavoidably the shock to be modified by the nonthermal pressure , unless one starts from an uninterestingly small pressure of seed particles at the beginning .",
    "second , the fact that the spectrum becomes flatter than @xmath156 , which is the result for a strong non - relativistic shock , implies that most of the nonthermal energy is pushed to the highest energies , therefore the shock again can be more easily modified .",
    "both these points suggest that a nonlinear treatment of shock re - acceleration is required .    in our galaxy , cosmic rays",
    "are observed to be in rough equipartition with the gas pressure and with magnetic fields , therefore supernova shocks or shocks generated in other environments propagate in a medium in which the seed particles ( cosmic rays ) are non - negligible . in these circumstances",
    "the non - linear effects may be very important .",
    "we showed here that in fact for some regions of the parameter space , the shock is modified mainly by the backreaction of the seed particles rather than by the cosmic rays accelerated at the shock from the thermal pool .",
    "the spectra of the re - accelerated particles have also been calculated .",
    "the interesting phenomenon of the appearance of multiple shock solutions , already known for the case of shock acceleration , appears also for the case of reacceleration .",
    "this puzzling phenomenon may suggest that the shock behaves as a self - regulating system settling on the critical point , as proposed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that the multiple solutions may be the artifact of some of the assumptions used in the analytical approach , in particular the request for time independent ( stationary ) solutions and the fact that the role of the self - generated waves on the diffusion coefficient is not taken into account .",
    "further investigation , in particular in the direction of a detailed comparison of our results with numerical simulations of shock acceleration is required in order to unveil the physical meaning of the multiple solutions for modified shocks .    from the phenomenological point of view , it would be certainly worth to study the implications of nonlinear shock reacceleration on the nonthermal activity in astrophysical environments where the effect is expected to play an important role , in particular in the case of supernova remnants . in particular , as pointed out by the referee , the suggested dominance of reaccelerated ambient seed particles over freshly injected particles may have serious implications for the spectra of secondary nuclei resulting from spallation processes .",
