    "<S> we estimate the couplings in the heavy hadron chiral theory ( hhct ) lagrangian from the qcd sum rules in an external axial field . we take into account the perturbative correction to the meson correlator in the infinite mass limit . with the perturbative correction and three successive power corrections , </S>",
    "<S> the meson correlator in an axial field becomes one of the best known correlators . in spite of this , the corresponding sum rule is not very stable . </S>",
    "<S> it yields the result @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the central value of the heavy meson decay constant with the perturbative correction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is surprisingly low as compared with the constituent quark model estimate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rules for @xmath3 following from nondiagonal @xmath4 and diagonal @xmath5 baryon correlators in an external axial field suggest @xmath6 , while diagonal @xmath4 and nondiagonal @xmath5 baryon sum rules have too large uncertainties .    </S>",
