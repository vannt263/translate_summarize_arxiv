    "<S> experimental growth kinetics by various authors , obtained for a wide range of growth parameters are shown to collapse into one single curve when the scaling properties of this model equations are explored .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 silicon oxide films thermally grown on single - crystalline si ( c - si ) wafers in dry o@xmath0 are still the most common materials used as gate dielectrics in si - based metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) structures . as device dimensions shrink below 0.25 @xmath1 m , the oxide films are forced to scale down to thicknesses of 5 nm and less . </S>",
    "<S> reliability of highly integrated si devices is critically dependent on the characteristics of the vitreous oxide film , like thickness uniformity , defect density , dielectric strength , and others , as well as on those of the oxide / si interface , like roughness , electronic states density and others @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric performance of ultrathin films of silicon oxide thermally grown on si and the structural and electronic properties of the oxide / si interface have been intensively studied experimentally , theoretically , and computationally @xcite in synergism with the development of the semiconductor industry . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of film growth kinetics , however , did not make any significant progress since the early model of deal and grove @xcite , which subsisted as the only fundamental approach . </S>",
    "<S> the deal and grove model , and more specifically the resulting linear - parabolic law , agrees with the observed growth kinetics in dry o@xmath0 only above a certain thickness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an expected fact from the model itself , since its basic assumption is that growth is promoted by interstitial diffusion of the oxidant species , the o@xmath0 molecule , through a previously grown oxide layer , thick enough to guarantee steady state regime . </S>",
    "<S> besides , reaction between o@xmath0 and si is assumed to take place solely at an abrupt oxide / si interface , producing stoichiometric sio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this initial oxide thickness was estimated @xcite from experimental data as being between 20 and 30 nm , well above the thickness range of interest for present and future use in microelectronics si - devices . </S>",
    "<S> description of the growth kinetics in the lower thickness range was addressed by many authors , within the deal and grove model framework , adding new terms to the linear - parabolic expression in order to fit experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although fitting the experimental curves , and so providing useful analytical expressions capable of reproducing the whole thickness interval , the extra terms added to the deal and grove expression did not have a well - defined physical meaning , even though their dependence on some processing parameters , like temperature for instance , could be explored @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> none of these models has been shown to be clearly correct and none of them has gained widespread acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> one is left then with several empirical expressions which can be used to model the growth kinetics in dry o@xmath0 in the thin and ultrathin film regimes below 20 nm , as well as in further stages of growth , but with no satisfactory physical explanation @xcite . according to b. deal @xcite `` such an expression may well fit the data , but provides little guidance or insight into mechanisms involved or effects of process variations '' .    </S>",
    "<S> recent investigations showed that as film thickness decreases below 20 nm , the contribution to film growth due to reaction away from the interface region becomes increasingly significant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there are strong theoretical and experimental evidences of the existence of a reactive layer formed by sub - oxides ( also called si - excess ) near the oxide / si interface @xcite .    in the present work the thermal growth of silicon oxide films on si </S>",
    "<S> is modelled as a dynamical system , assuming that it is basically a diffusion - reaction phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> since steady - state regime is not imposed , an initial oxide thickness is not required . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the model is expected to describe the whole oxide thickness interval . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion - reaction equations have been used to describe different systems @xcite but , to our knowledge , this is the first time they are applied to silicon oxide growth kinetics . the diffusing species is taken to be o@xmath0 , to model what has been largely demonstrated by isotopic substitution experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> growth is promoted by reaction of o@xmath0 with si , not necessarily at the oxide / si interface , but wherever the two species meet . </S>",
    "<S> the growth kinetics can then be obtained at any temperature by specifying the diffusivity of the o@xmath0 molecule in the silica network , @xmath2 , the reaction rate between o@xmath0 and si , @xmath3 , and the o@xmath0 pressure in the gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> growth in one dimension is considered , which is the most common experimental situation , meaning that as a face of c - si is exposed to o@xmath0 , the silica film grows in the direction perpendicular to this face . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed description for the growth kinetics is contained in the following coupled partial differential equations : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the concentration of the i - species ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the solid phase , in units of number of atoms per unit volume , @xmath8 , normalised by the concentration of si in c - si , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the state of any species at any time is characterised by a density function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the coordinate in the direction of growth , @xmath12 indicating the surface of the sample , and @xmath13 is the elapsed growth time . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation describes the o@xmath0 concentration rate and it is essentially a balance equation . at a given position the concentration of oxygen may vary due to the net flux of o@xmath0 through fully ( sio@xmath0 in oxide bulk ) or partially ( sio@xmath14 , @xmath15 , near the interface @xcite ) oxidised si , modelled by the diffusion term with a diffusion constant @xmath2 , or due to reaction to produce silicon oxide , characterised by a reaction rate constant @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the second equation describes the si concentration rate , which is only due to reaction with o@xmath0 , implying that si is an immobile species @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the silicon oxide concentration , @xmath16 , does not explicitly appear in these equations , but it is in direct connection with @xmath17 through the expression @xmath18 reflecting conservation of si species in the si + o@xmath19 sio@xmath0 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the o@xmath0 diffusivity at a certain temperature does not change during oxidation , and therefore @xmath2 is constant throughout the whole growth process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , based on the fact that oxygen diffuses mainly through oxide , one neglects volume changes due to the above chemical reaction . in order to complete the description in terms of equations ( [ edif ] ) , it is necessary to provide the initial and boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> they are @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the o@xmath0 concentration in the gas phase and @xmath22 is the ratio between the accessible free volume for o@xmath0 in the silica network and the unit volume of the solid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initially there is a pure , c - si substrate from @xmath12 to @xmath23 , whose surface is exposed to a gaseous medium , o@xmath0 , with a relative concentration at this surface represented in the second condition by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> reaction of these two species produces silicon oxide , not necessarily stoichiometric , as the solid - phase reaction si + o@xmath19 sio@xmath0 may occur in several steps . </S>",
    "<S> as time proceeds , o@xmath0 diffuses through the oxide network , reaches si , reacts producing more oxide , and consequently pushes the oxide / si interface further in the positive @xmath11 region . </S>",
    "<S> different values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath25 imply different kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be used to define `` natural '' units for the system , resulting in a set of adimensional equations with only one parameter , namely @xmath25 @xcite . under the following transformations : @xmath26 the resulting adimensional set of differential equations and initial and boundary conditions are @xmath27 leaving @xmath25 as the only parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is a powerful statement . </S>",
    "<S> it predicts that in all experiments performed at the same gas pressure , oxide growth kinetics and o@xmath0 and si concentrations versus depth curves ( profiles ) at different temperatures collapse to the same curves , provided that appropriate units are used : @xmath28 for time and @xmath29 for thickness .    in order to obtain profiles and growth kinetics , eqs.([eadi ] ) must be solved . </S>",
    "<S> those are partial , nonlinear , coupled differential equations and can not be analytically solved at all times . on the other hand , they can be easily solved by finite differences methods , iterating for as long as it takes to reproduce the growth time of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation gives then the profiles @xmath30 of all species and the kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> typical profiles at different growth times for a given value of @xmath25 are shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the o@xmath0 profiles are not straight lines as they are assumed to be in the steady - state regime @xcite . strictly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> steady - state is never attained as long as the oxide / si interface moves deeper into the c - si substrate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this interface is not sharp , in accordance with a wealth of experimental evidences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still in strict accordance with theoretical predictions @xcite and experimental observations @xcite , a finite width region formed by si in various lower oxidation states ( + 1 , + 2 , + 3 , sub - oxides or si - excess ) early develops between the stoichiometric sio@xmath0 film and the c - si substrate . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , o@xmath0-si reaction can take place in the whole region where non - fully oxidised si is available .     </S>",
    "<S> profiles in the solid phase at various temperatures and one pressure , for different oxidation times . </S>",
    "<S> the solid , dashed , and dot - dashed lines represent , respectively , the profiles at increasing oxidation times . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows that the two hypotheses of the deal and grove model are not valid : i ) steady - state regime is never attained ; </S>",
    "<S> ii ) reaction between o@xmath0 and si leading to growth does not take place at a sharp oxide / si interface . for high enough temperatures and pressures , and long enough times </S>",
    "<S> , the o@xmath0 profile approaches a straight line , and the thickness of the near - interface , sub - oxide region is much smaller than the oxide thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this is the observed situation at oxide thicknesses well above 20 nm . in this limit , steady state and abrupt interface </S>",
    "<S> are plausible approximations . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically the deal and grove assumptions are valid , whereas at initial stages they are not . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetics in the initial growth regime , which was described as `` anomalous '' in the deal and grove framework , naturally emerges from the present model as follows . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the quantity that is mainly focused in practical situations : the oxide thickness @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate it through the relation : @xmath32 the oxide growth kinetics @xmath33 is completely determined by @xmath34 , whose evolution is ruled by eqs.([eadi ] ) and therefore is determined by a unique parameter @xmath25 , the concentration of o@xmath0 in the gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the particular form of the differential equations , together with boundary and initial conditions , the system presents a further scaling property . </S>",
    "<S> suppose two different growth kinetics , with o@xmath0 concentrations in the gas phase given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then the following relations apply @xmath37 therefore , besides collapsing for different temperatures ( i.e. different @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) when natural units of the system are used , kinetic curves for different @xmath25 collapse to one single curve due to the symmetry present in the form of the diffusion - reaction model equations together with initial and boundary conditions . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction is that all kinetic curves reduce to a single one .    </S>",
    "<S> these predictions were tested with kinetic curves taken from references @xcite , corresponding to oxidations in joule - effect heated and rapid thermal processing furnaces in a variety of growth parameters ( temperature , o@xmath0 pressure , and time ) leading to oxide thicknesses ranging from 1 to 100 nm . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show the collapse of the experimental kinetics ( symbols , colours ) into the theoretical curve ( line , black ) . for the kinetics curves from reference @xcite , with five points in each curve </S>",
    "<S> , we first used the scaling predicted by eqs.([scal ] ) , obtaining four different curves , one for each temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we then scaled these curves using natural units for @xmath11 and @xmath13 according to eqs.([natu ] ) until they overlapped the theoretical curve . </S>",
    "<S> the curves from reference @xcite contained much more experimental points , extending from 0.1 to 1000 min , and from 1 to 80 nm . for these curves </S>",
    "<S> the pressure scaling predicted by eqs.([scal ] ) is not perfect at long growth times , probably due to an increase in diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> they were then collapsed one by one into the theoretical curve using eqs.([natu ] ) first , and then eqs.([scal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same procedure was used to collapse the kinetics from references @xcite into the theoretical curve .        </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic depart from the theoretical curve is an expected result , since the present model assumes a constant diffusivity throughout the whole growth process , despite many evidences that this is not the case : i ) transport of the diffusing species through the o - excess region near the surface @xcite , through the si - excess region near the oxide / si interface @xcite , and through the stoichiometric sio@xmath0 in the bulk of the growing oxide film have different diffusivities ; ii ) the growth of the defective , near - surface and near - interface regions saturate within a few nm @xcite , while the bulk , stoichiometric oxide grows continuously . </S>",
    "<S> so , interstitial diffusion of o@xmath0 through the bulk of the growing oxide gives a relative contribution that increases as the width of this region becomes dominant ; iii ) oxidations performed in dry o@xmath0 flow during long time intervals ( hours ) may suffer from water vapor contamination , which accelerates the oxide growth @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking the dimensional oxide thickness @xmath38 , and defining @xmath39 , the asymptotic solution to eqs.([eadi ] ) predicts the inverse growth rate @xmath40 , with @xmath41 constant , which is very similar to the asymptotic approximation of the deal and grove model @xcite @xmath42 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 the inverse growth rate is plotted as a function of oxide film thickness for different experimental kinetics @xcite .     and theoretical inverse growth rate ( inset ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a deviation from a straight line in the thick film range is apparent , corresponding to a variable , increasing diffusivity , contrary to the theoretical prediction shown in the inset .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the thermal growth of silicon oxide films on c - si in dry o@xmath0 is promoted by diffusion of o@xmath0 through the growing oxide with variable diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> similar physical arguments could support a variable diffusion rate . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even using constant , effective values for the diffusivity and reaction rate , modelling the growth as a diffusion - reaction process where conditions such as initial thickness , steady - state regime , and reaction solely at an abrupt interface are abandoned allows to reproduce the observed kinetics , especially in the lower thickness ( ultrathin film ) regime which is the one of present and future practical interest . </S>",
    "<S> realistic model evaluations of variable diffusivity and reaction rate stay beyond the scope of the present work , although this seems to be the only route to a quantitative description of the complete growth kinetics .    </S>",
    "<S> the present approach opens the possibility of incorporating new and determinant facts on o@xmath0 transport at initial stages of thermal oxide growth and on structure of the oxide / si interface , that were discovered after the proposal of deal and grove @xcite and not yet integrated into growth kinetics models . </S>",
    "<S> some were discussed here , like the graded , si - excess nature of the oxide / si interface and the incorporation of freshly arriving o@xmath0 into different regions of the growing oxide , while several others may also be included in a diffusion - reaction approach , such as the role played by oxygen excess centers @xcite in the near - surface region on oxygen transport which has been recently investigated @xcite .    99    buchanan , d. a. and lo , s. h. growth , in _ the physics and chemistry of sio@xmath0 and the si - sio@xmath0 interface-3 _ vol 96 - 1 ( eds . </S>",
