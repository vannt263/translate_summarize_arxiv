    "in 1924 eddington proposed a theory of gravity based solely on a connection field , without introducing a metric . a particular extension of eddignton s theory including matter fields",
    "was recently considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in a vacuum",
    ", this theory reproduces ` eddington - inspired ' ( or just ` eddington ' ) gravity and is completely equivalent to general relativity ( gr ) , a fact which should be contrasted with other modified gravity theories in which vacuum deviations are expected ( e.g. metric @xmath5 theories @xcite ) . on the other hand deviations from gr",
    "are seen in regions of high density . where one would expect singularities such as the interior of black holes or the birth of the universe , in eddington inspired gravity often these are avoided @xcite ( although other singularities may appear in an astrophysical context @xcite ) . the appearance of such behaviour in a purely classical theory such as eddington gravity is interesting and exciting .",
    "the cosmological implications of this theory were initially considered in @xcite , and studied in more depth in @xcite and @xcite ; it was found that universes containing ordinary matter avoid singularites , with the exact behaviour depending on the sign of one of the parameters of the theory , and being either a regular bounce ( from contraction to expansion ) or ` loitering ' around a minimum size before transitioning to gr - like expansion .",
    "it has also recently been shown that tensor perturbations may render the regular behaviour of such cosmological models unstable near the minimum scale ( either in the asymptotic past or at the bounce @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we confirm those findings ( in the addition of spatial curvature to the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric ) , and present other interesting behaviour viz .",
    "universes which experience unbounded expansion rate at finite density akin to undergoing a second big bang/`cosmic hiccup ' , and closed universes which oscillate between two finite values of the density .",
    "finally we investigate the dynamics of universes in which the dominant contribution to the stress - energy tensor is due to a scalar field with an exponential potential , as has been done in the case of gr @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ definitions ] covers some basic definitions and the governing field equations ; section [ friedman eqn .",
    "general ] exhibits the friedman equation and qualitatively compares it to gr ; section [ w / o phi ] examines solutions to this with domination by one kind of perfect fluid ; section [ k > 0 , w > 0 ] demonstrates the ` loitering ' behaviour which has previously been observed ; section",
    "[ k > 0 , -1/3 <",
    "w < 0 ] investigates the ` cosmic hiccup ' mentioned above ; section [ oscillating universes ] exhibits the oscillating universes ; section [ w phi ] covers the case of domination by a scalar field ; section [ loitering ] investigates the ` loitering ' behaviour which has been observed for the case of regular matter fields and which shows up again in the case of scalar fields ; section [ expconexp ] exhibits some universes which show qualitatively new behaviour - expansion , followed by contraction , followed by expansion . in section [ conclusion ] we conclude .      the action governing eddington gravity is @xcite @xmath6 = & \\frac{2}{\\kappa } \\int \\mathrm{d}^4 x \\left [ \\sqrt{| g + \\kappa r(\\gamma ) | } - \\lambda \\sqrt{| g | } \\right ] + s_m[g,\\psi ] , \\label{edd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( throughout this paper we use reduced planck units , @xmath7 ) where @xmath8 denotes the symmetric part of the ricci tensor , and @xmath9 is a dimensionless constant which must satisfy @xmath10 if gr is to be recovered in the limit of @xmath11 ( though the cosmological constant will be assumed negligible in the following ) .",
    "gravitational theories with such a born - infeld - like structure have previously been investigated in @xcite .",
    "matter can , of course , be coupled to the connection as well as the metric , however for simplicity here it is assumed to only couple to @xmath12 .",
    "two field equations are derived from this action : @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is an _",
    "auxiliary metric _ which is compatible with the connection i.e. @xmath15 , and @xmath16^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] .",
    "the action ( [ edd ] ) , and its equations of motion ( [ 1st fe],[2nd fe ] ) , can also be derived from the following bigravity theory , @xmath17 & = & \\int \\sqrt{q } ( q^{\\mu\\nu}r_{\\mu\\nu}(q ) - 2\\lambda ) \\\\   & & \\ \\ + \\",
    "\\lambda ( \\sqrt{q}q^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu } - 2\\sqrt{g } ) + \\sqrt{g } l_{m}(g)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 varying ( [ actiongq ] ) with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 one obtains a set of equations fully equivalent to ( [ 1st fe],[2nd fe ] ) .",
    "this form of the action is particularly interesting because it shows a remarkable close relation with the recently discovered family of unitary massive gravity theories @xcite . indeed , massive gravities are built as bigravity theories where the potential is a linear combination of the symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath21 for this class of potentials the theory has no boulware - deser instability and , in particular , the massive sector carries 5 degrees of freedom instead of 6 . besides the cosmological constants ( which also appear in ( [ actiongq ] ) ) , one such symmetric polynomial is @xmath22 the first term is precisely the interaction between @xmath19 and @xmath20 appearing in ( [ actiongq ] ) , resulting in eddington theory coupled to matter . the second piece ( more difficult to compute because the square root has to be taken before the trace ) is not part of the eddington theory .",
    "we find it intriguing that eddington s theory coupled to matter is so close to the recently discovered stable massive gravity theories .",
    "we shall exploit this connection elsewhere .",

    "if one assumes that @xmath37 , i.e. as the universe increases in size , the potential energy of the scalar field decreases , then in fact the values for @xmath36 are simply of different signs .",
    "however whilst this assumption may hold for the low - density gr - like stage of evolution , it fails in the high density case with some interesting consequences as laid out in section [ expconexp ]    another departure from gr is that spatial curvature can not be considered a fluid , since it does not enter in the same way as a fluid with @xmath38 ( which it would have to have in order to evolve as curvature ) .",

    "we first consider the dynamics of universes which do not posses scalar fields , have a negligible cosmological constant and , for simplicity , only one type of perfect fluid .",

    "note that setting @xmath44 ( so that the universe contains only a cosmological constant ) reduces eqn .",
    "( [ friedman w / o phi ] ) to exactly that which would be expected in gr , as it should be since eddington gravity exactly reproduces gr in a vacuum ( with a cosmological constant ) .",

    ".domain restrictions placed on @xmath45 by the square root [ cols=\"^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     points at which @xmath46 and @xmath47 will induce an expanding universe to collapse ( and vice versa ) since the universe can not evolve further on this trajectory ( because @xmath48 ) and the stationary point is unstable since only @xmath45 , and not the sign of @xmath36 , is fixed by the physics .",
    "such ` bounce ' points exist in gr ( if @xmath49 ) , and in eddington gravity as well , i.e. the points @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we are not including @xmath52 here because , although @xmath45 behaves as required , starting from a non - zero density this point can not be reached in a finite time .    from ( [ friedman w / o phi ] )",
    "we see that at @xmath53 .",
    "this novel type of stationary point leads to the ` loitering ' behaviour remarked upon in @xcite , and @xcite , in which the universe asymptotically approaches ( or recedes from ) a maximum density / minimum size . from table [ rho sign ] we see that for a positive energy density , this type of universe will only exist for @xmath54 .",
    "as seen in figure [ hrho - auv_1 ] , this type of universe exhibits the ` loitering ' behaviour mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we also see that to a good approximation the evolution can be split into two phases : the loitering phase in which deviations from gr are important , and the gr - like phase in which the dynamics of the expansion are approximately as given by gr .",
    "close to the maximum density @xmath55 the term involving @xmath56 is much smaller than the other terms in the numerator of ( [ friedman w / o phi ] ) , and so we can neglect ( small ) spatial curvature during the loitering phase . expanding about the maximum density , or equivalently the minimum scale factor @xmath57 , to highest order the friedman equation and deceleration parameter become @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) . using @xmath61 , ( [ friedman loitering ] )",
    "can be solved to get @xmath62    thus we see that the universe undergoes ( accelerating ) exponential expansion away from the minimum scale factor during this phase .",
    "the form of @xmath63 is reminiscent of that observed in gr under domination by a cosmological constant , specifically with @xmath64 .",
    "calculating the particle horizon for such a universe we find @xmath65 which diverges .",
    "again this is similar to gr under domination by a cosmological constant . in @xcite",
    "the authors note that eddington gravity can be characterised as making the gravitational force repulsive at short distances ( or high densities ) , which would agree with the behaviour which we see here .",
    "that is , the maximum density is reached as the repulsive effects of eddington gravity oppose the traditional attractive effects of the matter density ; which repulsive effects take a form similar to a cosmological constant with @xmath64 .          from eqn .",
    "( [ auxiliary metric ] ) we see that the auxiliary metric @xmath19 is identical to the metric @xmath20 except that the temporal and spatial components of @xmath14 are modulated by the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "alternatively , by factoring out @xmath66 , it can be considered to be related to an frw metric with modified scale factor @xmath68 , by an overall conformal transformation @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath66 and @xmath67 , or @xmath66 and @xmath69 explain how the space described by the auxiliary metric behaves .",

    "on the other hand , close to the maximum density @xmath71 , and the space described by @xmath14 becomes vanishingly small .",
    "interestingly , @xmath67 reaches a maximum value just before the gr regime begins .    expanding close to the maximum density we find @xmath72    and",
    "so we see that , moving towards the maximum density , the temporal size decreases more rapidly than the spatial , with the result that @xmath69 actually goes infinite .",
    "this case exhibits the same loitering behaviour at early times , but must be treated separately , since the density is unbounded ; expanding about @xmath74 , to leading order we find : @xmath75 which is identical to gr with a cosmological constant @xmath64 . therefore the particle horizon will diverge as in the case @xmath2 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath66 and @xmath69 is the same as in the @xmath2 case , however in contrast , @xmath67 diverges as @xmath76 .",

    "firstly it should be noted that new physics ( beyond eddington gravity ) is required in order to have a fluid with @xmath77 dominating in the early universe ; this problem is not considered here .        as shown in table [ discontinuities",

    "this can be solved as in section [ loitering phase ] to get @xmath80    thus at this critical point the universe in some sense undergoes a second big bang , with expansion similar to that of gr with domination by radiation ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "the scale factor as a function of time is then @xmath84    in order to better understand the dynamics of the universe during this second big bang/`cosmic hiccup ' we should consider the horizon between two times @xmath85 close to @xmath86 : @xmath87 its well - behaved nature should not be surprising , however , since the nature of the expansion during the ` hiccup ' has already been noted .",
    "an interesting quantity to consider is @xmath86 , the time between the birth of the universe and the ` hiccup ' .",

    "this occurs because the expansion rate of the universe heads towards zero at high densities more quickly than @xmath88 , as indeed it should if the high density behaviour observed in section [ k > 0 , w = 0 ] is to be recovered when @xmath73 .      in the high density limit",
    "the overall size of the space described by @xmath14 diverges , but the combined effect of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is that @xmath69 remains proportional to the regular scale factor .    at the ` hiccup ' @xmath66 and @xmath67 as functions of @xmath98 or @xmath99",

    "the addition of spatial curvature to eddington cosmology thus leads to the interesting prospect of oscillatory behaviour .",
    "figure [ hrho - auv3 ] demonstrates such an oscillatory universe .",

    "the reader may be worried that using @xmath126 as a i.c .",
    "eliminates from consideration any solutions which show monotonically increasing field values , however such solutions would not exhibit the maximum density and loitering behaviour ( since if @xmath27 is unbounded from below the density will also be unbounded , and if @xmath27 tends to some constant value , the pressure would be negative and hence not satisfy @xmath127 ) .",
    "all that s left is to describe the potential , which leaves two free parameters : @xmath125 and @xmath9 . from the figures",
    "thus far presented we can roughly evaluate the effect of making the potential steeper ( increasing @xmath9 ) or deeper ( increasing @xmath125 ) .    the late time ( gr - like ) behaviour is primarily governed by the value of @xmath9 , whereas the early time behaviour is influenced by @xmath125 .",
    "the reason for the latter is that the energy density of the field is already fixed as @xmath76 , and picking a value for @xmath125 fixes it at @xmath128 ( or wherever the transitionary period is located ) , and thus the behaviour in between these two points will be greatly influenced by the size of the change in the energy density .",
    "furthermore one can roughly say that steeper and deeper potentials lead to quicker transitions from the loitering to the gr phase .",

    "the evolution is well described without having to denote a separate transitionary regime ( between the high - density loitering behaviour and the low - density gr - like regime ) , that is not the case here .",
    "the transition from linearly decreasing field values to logarithmically increase is naturally centred on @xmath139 .",
    "hence during the transition @xmath140 : the scalar field has the equation of state of a cosmological constant .",
    "this is readily observed in plots of @xmath141 which show that the density is stationary around the transition .",
    "see figure [ a_phi_rho_w_ordinary ] , top right panel .",
    "the bottom right panel of this figure also confirm this , as well as the above comment that @xmath142 in the loitering regime ( @xmath143 as @xmath76 , regardless of the values of the free parameters ) .",
    "finally it is interesting to look at the plot of @xmath144 against @xmath145 ( figure [ log(rho - a)_ordinary ] ) .",
    "this shows that during the loitering phase the density scales as @xmath146 , which agrees with the fact that @xmath147 - the scalar field is , to use the terminology used in @xcite , undergoing _",
    "( kinetic energy domination ) .",
    "this is followed by the expected cosmological constant - like transitionary phase in which the density is stationary .",
    "the field energy density shows the expected scaling in the gr phase ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "figure 1 from @xcite shows the evolution of the energy density of a scalar field in a gr - universe populated by the aforementioned scalar field ( with @xmath149 ) as well as radiation and cold matter .",
    "the scalar field is initially dominant and scales accordingly ( @xmath146 ) , becomes sub - dominant and scales like a constant , before finally tracking ( i.e. scaling as ) the cold matter ( @xmath150 ) which is then dominant .",
    "this bears a remarkable resemblance to figure [ log(rho - a)_ordinary ] , except for two major differences :    1 .",
    "the behaviour in the eddington case is reversed .",
    "the ` natural ' scaling ( i.e. that which one would expect in gr based on the value of @xmath9 ) is preceded by a period in which the scaling is fixed ( by something other than @xmath9 ) ; + 2 .   in the eddington case",
    "such behaviour is achieved without another fluid for the field to track .      as noted in section [ friedman eqn .",
    "general ] , the two solutions for the hubble parameter are not in general simply of the same magnitude but with opposite sign .",
    "this leads to the possibility that there are universes which at some point are stationary , and then instead of contracting and retracing their evolutionary history in reverse , they contract but trace a new history .",
    "( and hence @xmath151 ) to be discontinuous , then the standard gr behaviour of symmetry around a bounce is permitted as well . ]    in fact since the solutions being investigated are expanding both in their early and late histories , they would undergo expansion , followed by contraction , followed by expansion .        from figure [ fig_expconexp ]",
    "we see that such behaviour can be achieved both by making the potential steeper and by making it deeper .",
    "the latter can easily be understood since @xmath125 , which controls the depth of the potential , also controls the energy density of the scalar field at its transitionary point . thus choosing a sufficiently large @xmath125",
    "will ensure that the density at this point is larger than the density in the distant past ( loitering phase ) , and hence the universe must undergo contraction ( see figure [ fig_expconexp ] , bottom panel ) .    that steeper potentials induce this behaviour",
    "can be understood mathematically from the fact that the ` @xmath152 ' term in the friedman equation ( eqns .",
    "[ friedman ] , [ b ] ) is proportional to @xmath153 , and hence to @xmath9 .",
    "physically , perhaps one can imagine the cause to be that a potential which varies quickly enough with @xmath27 leads the scalar field to ` overshoot ' the value which would ensure energy density monotonically decreases with time ; this larger density would then be associated with a contraction .",
    "it is interesting to note that plots of the field value , or of the equation of state parameter do not obviously show any effect of the period of contraction or differ qualitatively from the corresponding plots for free parameter values which show the ordinary behaviour ( figure [ a_phi_rho_w_ordinary ] ) .",
    "unfortunately we have yet to determine the critical values of @xmath125 and @xmath9 which guard the transition into such behaviour .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the singularity - avoiding ` loitering ' behaviour observed for @xmath1 and domination by a perfect fluid is upheld for @xmath2 and that this result is not affected by the presence of spatial curvature .",
    "this behaviour shows remarkable similarities to the behaviour in gr with a cosmological constant @xmath64 .",
    "similar behaviour is also seen in the case of domination by a scalar field with an exponential potential .",
    "the scaling of the density with the scale factor in such universes is reminiscent of that observed in a gr universe with such a scalar field and ( initially more slowly scaling ) ordinary matter.the similarities to gr in each of these cases deserve further investigation which will shed light on the high density behaviour of eddington gravity .",
    "the ( past ) singularity avoiding behaviour of this theory should be compared to that examined in @xcite in which higher derivative terms in @xmath5 theories lead to future finite time singularity avoidance .",

    "we have also demonstrated novel behaviour unlike that seen in gr . in the former case",
    "we have the ` cosmic hiccup ' which is observed for @xmath1 , @xmath3 , as well as the oscillatory universes for @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and positive spatial curvature .",
    "in the latter case we have shown that especially deep or steep scalar field potentials lead the size of the universe oscillating whilst transitioning between the loitering and gr - like phases .",
    "there appears no initial reason why the singularity avoiding behaviour observed for @xmath4 can not also exist for a scalar field dominated universe . as explained above , symmetry around the bounce would be permitted in this case ( @xmath139 at the bounce).furthermore the interplay between the scalar field and regular matter fields could lead to interesting behaviour of the scalar field , as is the case in gr @xcite and remains to be studied in detail .",
