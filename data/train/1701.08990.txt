    "in this paper you can find a description of the activity of the taurids maxima observed in 2005 and 2015 .",
    "very bright events occurred during both peaks of activity ; especially in 2015 you could observe the taurids which brightness exceeded the brightness of full moon ; there were also many bright fireballs visible during several nights after the maximum . for all taurids observed in a period of 20 days starting at the end of october and ending at the beginning of november 2005 and 2015 we determined trajectories and orbits",
    "the majority of taurids orbits is similar to neo objects which orbital periods which are in 7:2 resonance with jupiter .",
    "it concerns especially the 2015 tx24 , the 2005 ur and the 2005 tf50 as well as the 2010 tu149 which orbit is very similar to orbits of the southern taurids observed at solar longitude of @xmath12 .",
    "the neo objects with orbits close to resonance orbits have also perihelions distinctly different than the perihelion of the 2p / encke comet ( noticeably smaller for the 2015 tx24 , 2005 ur and 2005 tf50 objects , noticeably bigger for the 2010 tu149 and the 2007 ul12 objects ) .",
    "these neo objects should not be treated as parent bodies of the 7:2 filament , it is more correct to treat them as the most massive remnants of the larger body fragmented in the past .",
    "it is worth to note that larger numbers of such bodies may exist in the southern taurid stream creating a kind of asteroidal core of the 7:2 stream .    among the observed taurids",
    "the spread of orbital elements is quite even no matter whether there are neo objects in the stream or not .",
    "there is very little chance of an accidental coincidence of those orbits with the swarm of the taurids and their presence is undoubtedly a result of a long and complex evolution of the taurid complex .",
    "currently these are the biggest objects circulating in the taurid stream ; what s more , the list of neo objects with orbits similar to those of the taurids most likely remains incomplete and it depends on the possibility of detection from earth .",
    "this paper is another proof that the taurid complex is certainly one of the most interesting objects in the solar system .",
    "it is able to produce both impressive meteor maxima and extremely bright fireballs ( dubietis & arlt 2006 , spurn 1994 ) attracting the attention of the media and ordinary people .",
    "additionally , it can be connected with catastrophic events like tunguska ( kresak 1978 , hartung 1993 ) and can affect the climate on earth ( asher & clube 1997 ) .",
    "accurate observations and analysis of all kind of bodies associated with the taurid complex are then very a important task , demanding to continue and affecting the safety of our planet .",

    "<S> the paper presents an analysis of polish fireball network ( pfn ) observations of enhanced activity of the southern taurid meteor shower in 2005 and 2015 . in 2005 , between october 20 and november 10 , seven stations of pfn determined 107 accurate orbits with 37 of them belonging to the southern taurid shower . in the same period of 2015 , </S>",
    "<S> 25 stations of pfn recorded 719 accurate orbits with 215 orbits of the southern taurids . </S>",
    "<S> both maxima were rich in fireballs which accounted to 17% of all observed taurids . </S>",
    "<S> the whole sample of taurid fireballs is quite uniform in the sense of starting and terminal heights of the trajectory . on the other hand a clear decreasing trend in geocentric velocity with increasing solar </S>",
    "<S> longitude was observed .    </S>",
    "<S> orbital parameters of observed southern taurids were compared to orbital elements of near earth objects ( neo ) from the neodys-2 database . using the drummond criterion @xmath0 with threshold as low as 0.06 </S>",
    "<S> , we found over 100 fireballs strikingly similar to the orbit of asteroid 2015 tx24 . </S>",
    "<S> several dozens of southern taurids have orbits similar to three other asteroids , namely : 2005 tf50 , 2005 ur and 2010 tu149 . all mentioned neos have orbital periods very close to the 7:2 resonance with jupiter s orbit . </S>",

    "<S> the 2015 tx24 and the 2005 ur asteroids are situated on almost identical orbits ; the 2005 tf50 has a distinctly higher orbit inclination but the perihelion distance , semi - major axis and orbital period are also very similar . </S>",
    "<S> the 2010 tu149 with a similar semi - major axis has a noticeably higher perihelion value . </S>",

    "<S> the 2003 uv11 which was found similar to as many as 97 southern taurid orbits has an orbit distinctively different than the others with semi - major axis of 1.45 au and the orbital period which is equal to only 639 days .    </S>",

    "<S> the eccentricity of the orbit is between 0.44 and 0.88 and you can notice a clear relation between the perihelion distance and the eccentricity . </S>",

    "<S> 6 shows that objects similar to the brightest taurids of october 31 , 2015 concur with the neos with the smallest perihelion distance and highest eccentricity - these are the 2005 ur , the 2015 tx24 and the 2005 tf50 . </S>",
    "<S> the second group is found for perihelion distances from 0.34 to 0.38 and it includes such asteroids as the 2007 ru17 , the 2010 tu149 and the 2007 ul12 .    among few taurids having the perihelion distance higher than 0.4 au we can find the 2015 tb15 and the 2011 ud asteroids . </S>",
    "<S> you should notice the position of the asteroid 2003 uv11 on the graph . </S>",

    "<S> seen at 23:12 ut . a similarity to the 2005 tf50 </S>",

    "<S> for the majority of the taurids from that range a simultaneous similarity to the 2015 tx24 , the 2005 ur and the 2005 tf50 seems to be typical ; those objects move on quite similar orbits but the 2005 tf50 , as an object with a noticeably higher orbit inclination , is distinctly less like the observed taurids .    </S>",
    "<S> if you compare taurids to the 2003 uv11 and the 2007 ru17 at the @xmath11 , the high similarity is noticeable but the majority of objects similar to 2003 uv11 show also a very close similarity to the 2007 ru17 . </S>",

    "<S> the period in which observed objects with similar orbits are situated is very wide , encompassing practically the whole range of solar longitudes . </S>",

    "<S> a big part of fireballs in 2005 and 2015 showed a very pronounced similarity to the orbit of the 2015 tx24 . </S>",
    "<S> that similarity is especially clear for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of data gathered in 2005 and in 2015 was checked separately . despite the fact that in 2005 we had definitely less data you still can perceive a distinct peak , reflecting the similarity with the 2015 tx24 . </S>",
    "<S> the height and solar longitude of the peak for 2005 and 2015 fit each other almost completely . </S>",
    "<S> it means the presence of the taurids on orbits very similar to the orbit of an object which orbital period is very close to the 7:2 resonance with jupiter . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 10 presents that similarity very clearly .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly for the objects connected to the 2003 uv11 and the 2007 ru17 a comparable activity was found in 2005 and in 2015 . when it comes to nights after november 4 , in 2005 we had very bad weather conditions and because of that it would be difficult to compare them directly to respective nights in 2015 ; still for @xmath18 an activity from orbits similar to the 2010 tu149 was detected . </S>",
    "<S> overall the activity pattern of 2005 and 2015 seems to be very much alike . </S>"
