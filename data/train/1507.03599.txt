    "recent high - resolution direct imaging observations have revealed spiral structure in three protoplanetary disks around herbig ae / be stars : sao 206462 ( muto et al .",
    "2012 ; garufi et al . 2013 ) , mwc 758 ( grady et al .  2013 ; benisty et al .  2015 ) , and hd 100546 ( currie et al .",
    "the polarized intensity has been measured in these observations to gain higher contrast between the disk and the central star .",
    "while the thermal emission from the central star is unpolarized , the scattered light from the disk is polarized . in these",
    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) polarized intensity images , two spiral arms with roughly 180@xmath0 rotational symmetry are present in both sao 206462 and mwc 758 , similar to the grand design in a spiral galaxy ( e.g. the whirlpool galaxy m51 ) .",
    "the spiral arms also exhibit a high contrast against the background disk .",
    "the polarized intensity of the spiral arm is several times higher than that of the region outside the spiral arm .",
    "it should also be noted that , since the dust scattering opacity is quite large , these observations only probe structure high up at the disk atmosphere ( e.g. several disk scale heights ) where the last dust scattering surface is .",
    "in addition to spiral patterns , these three disks also have gaps or holes ( sao 206462 with a submillimeter cavity of 46 au , mwc 758 with a cavity of 73 au from andrews et al .",
    "2011 , and hd 100546 with a cavity of 10 au revealed by sed fitting from bouwman et al . 2003 ) , which indicates that they are members of the protoplanetary disk class called transitional disks ( espaillat et al .",
    "one scenario to explain both spiral patterns and gaps / holes is that these disks harbor low - mass companions ( e.g. young planets ) which can open gaps and excite spiral waves at the same time ( e.g. , baruteau et al .",
    "2014 ) .    however , there are two difficulties in explaining the observed spiral patterns using planet - induced spiral wakes .",
    "first , the large pitch angle of all the observed spiral arms suggests that the disk has a relative high temperature ( e.g. @xmath1250 k at 70 au for mwc 758 , benisty et al .",
    "2015 ) . in linear theory ,",
    "spiral waves are basically sound waves in disks , and the pitch angle of the spiral arms is directly related to the sound speed in the disk . using the linear theory , the best fit models for both sao 206462 ( muto et al .",
    "2012 ) and mwc 758 ( grady et al .  2013",
    "; benisty et al .",
    "2015 ) suggest that the disk aspect ratio ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 ) at @xmath4 au is around 0.2 which is too large for any realistic disk structure .",
    "for example , even if the stellar irradiation is perpendicular to the disk surface , the maximum disk temperature due to the stellar irradiation is @xmath5 so that @xmath6 . assuming a 2 @xmath7 central star with 10 @xmath8 luminosity ,",
    "the maximum temperature is @xmath170 k at 100 au and @xmath2 is only @xmath10.1 .",
    "since @xmath9 , it is very difficult to make @xmath100.2 .",
    "second , the observed spiral arms exhibit much higher brightness contrasts than suggested by the synthetic observations based on two dimensional ( 2-d ) planet - disk simulations .",
    "juhsz et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have calculated the polarized scattered light images by combining 2-d hydrodynamical simulations with 3-d monte - carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) simulations .",
    "vertical hydrostatic equilibrium has been assumed to extend the 2-d simulation to the third dimension ( the vertical direction ) .",
    "they find that a relative change of about 3.5 on the spiral arms in the surface density is required for the spirals to be detectable .",
    "this value is a factor of eight higher than what is seen in their hydrodynamical simulations .    in this paper , we first point out that the pitch angle formula derived from the linear theory , which has been used in almost all previous spiral arm modeling efforts , does not apply to the high planet mass cases .",
    "spiral wakes that are excited by high mass planets ( e.g. 1 @xmath11 ) become spiral shocks which propagate at speeds faster than the local sound speed ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the pitch angle difficulty above can be alleviated by considering the non - linear extension of the spiral shock theory .",
    "we also show that spiral arms ( especially the inner arms ) have complicated non - hydrostatic 3-d structure .",
    "such structure can lead to strong density perturbation at the disk surface resulting in a corrugated shape of its atmosphere . since near - ir observations only probe the shape of disk surface , this effect alleviates the second difficulty mentioned above . in dong et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , we have combined mcrt simulations with hydrodynamical simulations from this paper and demonstrated that planet - induced inner spiral arms can explain recent near - ir direct imaging observations of sao 206462 and mwc 758 .",
    "we note that , since the planets that we have proposed are outside the spiral arms , we can not explain the gaps discovered at small radii in these transitional disks .",
    "other mechanisms , e.g. another planet or photoevaporation , are needed to explain these gaps .",
    "before we introduce our numerical method in  3 , we provide the theoretical background in  2 .",
    "the shape of the spiral wakes will be studied in  4 , and their 3-d structure will be presented in  5 . after a short discussion in  6",
    ", we summarize our results in  7 .",
    "as a result of planet - disk interaction , a spiral arm forms due to the constructive interference of density wakes with different azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath12 excited by the planet at lindblad resonances . in the linear density wave theory , the @xmath12-th fourier component of the planet potential excites the density wave having @xmath12 spiral arms @xmath13}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is any perturbed quantity associated with the wave , @xmath15 is its complex amplitude , @xmath16 is the radial wave vector , and @xmath17 is the planet orbital frequency .",
    "thus , the wave has the same phase along the curve satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "the pitch angle ( @xmath19 ) of the equal phase curve satisfies tan@xmath20 , so @xmath19=tan@xmath21|$ ] . using the dispersion relationship for density waves in the large @xmath12 limit and far from the launching point , @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath19=tan@xmath23 $ ] .",
    "because @xmath19 is independent of @xmath12 , different @xmath12 modes can constructively interfere to form the one armed spiral wake ( ogilvie & lubow 2002 ) .",
    "if the equal phase curve is integrated from the planet s position ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , the shape of the wake far from @xmath24 is given by rafikov ( 2002 ) and muto et al .",
    "( 2012 ) as @xmath26\\label{eq : linearwake}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the disk aspect ratio at @xmath24 , @xmath28 , and the sound speed @xmath29 .",
    "however , when the planet is massive enough , the above linear density wave theory breaks down .",
    "linear waves excited by planets will steepen to shocks ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002 , dong , rafikov & stone 2012 , duffell & macfadyen 2012 , zhu et al .",
    "2013 ) after they propagate over a distance @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath32 is the disk thermal mass @xmath33 when @xmath34 , the spiral waves will immediately become spiral shocks after they are excited around the planet . unlike the linear wake which follows equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) , the spiral shock will expand away from the trajectory predicted by equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] )",
    "thus , if there is a massive planet in the disk , using equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) to fit the shape of the spiral shocks will predict an incorrect disk aspect ratio and temperature .",
    "to study density wakes / shocks excited by planets , we have carried out both 2-d and 3-d hydrodynamical simulations using athena++ .",
    "athena++ is a newly developed grid based code using a higher - order godunov scheme for mhd and the constrained transport ( ct ) to conserve the divergence - free property for magnetic fields ( stone et al .  , in preparation ) .",
    "but in this paper , we do not include magnetic fields and only solve hydrodynamical equations using athena++ .",
    "compared with its predecessor athena ( gardiner & stone 2005 , 2008 ; stone et al .",
    "2008 ) , athena++ is highly optimized and uses flexible grid structures , allowing global numerical simulations spanning a large radial range . furthermore",
    ", the geometric source terms in curvilinear coordinates ( e.g. in cylindrical and spherical - polar coordinates ) are carefully implemented so that angular momentum is conserved exactly ( to machine precision ) , which makes the code ideal for global disk simulations .",
    "our simulations use the adiabatic equation of state ( eos ) with the adiabatic index @xmath31=1.4 .",
    "a simple orbital cooling scheme has been applied to mimic the radiative cooling process in disks . in 3-d simulations ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the density and the internal energy per unit volume , while in 2-d simulations , we have adopted @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath37 are the disk surface density and the internal energy per unit area .",
    "@xmath40 is the heat capacity per unit mass , @xmath41 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath42 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath43 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "the cooling time @xmath44 can be written in the dimensionless form as @xmath45 .",
    "we fix @xmath46 to be a constant in each simulation . with this scheme ,",
    "the disk temperature is relaxed to the background disk temperature ( @xmath47 ) determined by stellar irradiation . in our simulations , @xmath47 is set to be the initial disk temperature . to estimate @xmath46 in a realistic disk",
    ", we use the grey atmosphere approximation ( hubeny 1990 ) for the radiative cooling , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath50 is the optical depth in the vertical direction , @xmath51 is the rosseland mean opacity , and @xmath52 is the midplane temperature . assuming @xmath53 and using equations ( [ eq : dedt ] ) and ( [ eq : dedt2 ] ) , we can derive @xmath54 approximating the polynomial of @xmath52 and @xmath47 in the denominator of equation [ eq : tcool ] with @xmath55 ^ 3 $ ] and assuming the central star is 1 @xmath7 , we have @xmath56 ^ 3}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\frac{1+\\tau^2}{\\tau}\\label{eq : tcoolvalue}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath46 can vary dramatically at different radii in disks . using the minimum mass solar nebular model , @xmath46 is @xmath110@xmath57 at 1 au and @xmath58 at 100 au .",
    "we have carried out three sets of simulations with @xmath59 , 1 , and 100 .",
    "they are respectively labeled as iso , t1 , t2 at the end of their names in table 1 .",
    "simulations with fast cooling ( @xmath59 ) are equivalent to locally isothermal simulations .",
    "simulations with @xmath60 are basically adiabatic simulations considering the timescale of the simulations is several tens of orbits , and simulations with @xmath61 should be between isothermal and adiabatic simulations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that simulations with @xmath62 are qualitatively similar to those with @xmath60 .",
    "this similarity suggests that the spiral waves in disks with @xmath62 behave adiabatically .",
    "we think that this is due to the short timescale for the flow to move across the spiral wake .",
    "the spiral wake has a typical width smaller than the disk scale height , and the background flow moves across the wake at nearly keplerian speed .",
    "thus , when the fluid travels in and out of the wave / shock , its response time is much smaller than the orbital time and should behave adiabatically even in disks with @xmath62 . considering this similarity ,",
    "in most part of the paper , we only show results with @xmath59 and 1 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) still provides a good fit to the density wakes ( the upper middle panel ) .    however , the shape of the spiral arms at the disk surface is affected by the 3-d structure of density wakes . at the disk surface in 3-d simulations ( even in the linear regime , shown in the upper right panel of figure [ fig : shock ] ) , both inner and outer arms are at smaller @xmath64 than equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) due to the tilted shock shape in figure [ fig : shockvender ] .",
    "when these shocks are far away from the planet , they are more tilted towards the central star at higher altitudes .",
    "this leads to the inner spiral arms becoming slightly more open ( with a larger pitch angle ) and the outer spiral arms becoming slightly less open ( with a smaller pitch angle ) than equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) would predict .",
    "when the planet has a mass larger than @xmath32 ( middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : shock ] ) , it can launch spiral shocks immediately around the planet , and the shape of spiral shocks can deviate from the trajectory predicted by equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) significantly .",
    "shocks excited by a more massive planet deviate from linear theory more and they have larger pitch angles .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : shock ] ) , spiral shocks in the 6 @xmath11 cases ( bottom panels ) are more open and deviate from the prediction of linear theory ( dotted curves ) more than shocks in the 1 @xmath11 cases ( middle panels ) .",
    "the deviation from the linear theory has also been seen in previous simulations , e.g. , figure 2 and 10 of de val - borro et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but it has not been explored and the physical reason for the deviation is left to be unexplained .",
    "this deviation from linear theory shown in figure [ fig : shock ] is consistent with the predictions from the weakly non - linear density wave theory by goodman & rafikov ( 2001 ) and rafikov ( 2002 ) . in weakly",
    "non - linear theory , the spiral shock can expand in both azimuthal directions away from equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) , and , at each radius , the shock density profile along the azimuthal direction is n - shaped ( figure 2 in goodman & rafikov 2001 ) .",
    "the n - shaped shock profile expands in the azimuthal direction at a speed which is proportional to the normalized amplitude of the shock ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , the higher is the planet mass , the stronger are the shocks and these shocks expand faster away from equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) .",
    "then , the spiral shock has a larger pitch angle as a result .",
    "similar to the 0.01 @xmath11 case , the inner spiral shocks in 1 and 6 @xmath11 cases are even more open at @xmath136 than at the midplane , while the outer arms become less open at the disk surface . for outer spiral arms ,",
    "this 3-d effect compensates the increased pitch angel due to the shock expansion , and coincidently the outer arms almost overlap with the prediction from linear theory .",
    "another important feature shown in figure [ fig : shock ] is that , besides the primary inner arm which originates from the planet , a secondary inner spiral arm appears with some azimuthal shift from the primary arm . for some cases ( e.g. cm2iso ) , we even see a tertiary arm at the very inner disk .",
    "the secondary spiral arm has also been seen in previous simulations having massive planets , e.g. figure 2 in kley ( 1999 ) and figure 10 of de val - borro et al .",
    "however , it has hardly been explored in earlier simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : shock ] shows that , even with a very low mass planet ( 0.01 @xmath11 , the upper panels of figure [ fig : shock ] ) , another density peak ( the secondary arm ) emerges close to the primary inner arm with low density region ( the rarefaction wave of the primary arm ) in between . after the secondary inner arm appears close to the primary arm , it can become shock during the propagation and later it will become n - shaped which is similar to the primary arm . then in some cases , a tertiary inner arm appears at the rarefaction wave part of the secondary arm . for 0.01 @xmath11 cases ,",
    "the primary and secondary inner arms are separated by @xmath137 at @xmath138 .",
    "when the planet gets more massive , the secondary inner arm is excited earlier and the separation between the primary and secondary arm increases . in 1 @xmath11 cases , the two inner arms are roughly separated by @xmath139 , and in 6 @xmath11 cases , the two arms are roughly separated by @xmath140 .",
    "this has an important application that we can use the separation between two arms to estimate the mass of the embedded planet .",
    "similar to the primary inner arm , the secondary inner arm is also stronger at the disk surface than at the disk midplane . for outer arms",
    ", the secondary arm appears in disks that have massive planets embedded , but the secondary outer arm is less apparent than the primary outer arm .",
    "more discussions on the 3-d structure of secondary arms will be presented in  5 .",
    "spiral wakes / shocks are slightly more open in a disk whose eos is not isothermal ( figure [ fig : shocktc1 ] ) .",
    "this is because density waves propagate slightly faster in a fluid with a non - isothermal eos than in a fluid at the same temperature with the isothermal eos ( e.g. goodman & rafikov 2001 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : shocktc1 ] , even with a moderate cooling rate ( @xmath62 ) , the spiral wakes excited by a low mass planet ( 0.01 @xmath11 ) can only be fitted by equation ( [ eq : linearwake ] ) using a larger disk scale height that is calculated with the adiabatic sound speed instead of the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath141 in equation [ eq : linearwake ] is thus @xmath142 ) .",
    "it is a little bit surprising that the spiral shape in disks with @xmath62 follows the spiral shape in adiabatic disks .",
    "we think this is due to the short timescale for the flow to move across the spiral wake .",
    "the spiral wake has a typical width smaller than the disk scale height , while the background flow moves across the wake at nearly keplerian speed .",
    "thus , when the fluid travels in and out of the wave / shock , its response time is much smaller than the orbital time and thus behave adiabatically .",
    "other aspects of the spiral shocks in non - isothermal cases are similar to the isothermal cases , e.g. , a higher mass planet excites a more open spiral shock , and the inner spiral shocks become slightly more open at higher altitudes .    to illustrate the shape of the spiral shocks in the physical space , we plot the relative density perturbation in cartesian coordinates in figure [ fig : shockcarg ] . clearly , the more massive the planet is , the more the spiral shocks deviate from linear theory .",
    "two well separated inner arms are also apparent when the planet mass is large , and the separation between these two arms is larger when the planet is more massive ( comparing the middle and bottom panels in figure [ fig : shockcarg ] ) .    to see how successful the weakly non - linear density wave theory of goodman & rafikov ( 2001 ) and rafikov ( 2002 ) fits the shape of the shocks in simulations , we plot in figure [ fig : shockcut ] the density contour and density profiles along the azimuthal direction at @xmath138 , 0.5 , 1.5 and 2 for run cm2iso . in the density contour panel",
    ", we can clearly see that the secondary arm appears at the edge of the low density rarefaction wave region of the primary arm .",
    "after the secondary arm propagates for a short distance , a tertiary arm appears close to the low density rarefaction wave region of the secondary arm . in the panels showing the density profiles , we follow goodman & rafikov ( 2001 ) and rafikov ( 2002 ) to shift the density profiles so that @xmath143 corresponds to the wake position from linear theory ( black curve in figure [ fig : shockcut ] or equation [ eq : linearwake ] ) .",
    "the density profiles clearly show that the shocks are n - shaped .",
    "a rarefaction wave follows the shock front , and @xmath129 at the rarefaction wave region can be negative before it merges to the background flow .",
    "the shock fronts deviate from @xmath143 , and due to the shock expansion , the deviation is larger when the shock is further away from the planet . under the shearing - sheet approximation , the amplitude and width of the n - shaped shock scale as @xmath144 and @xmath145 at @xmath1460 based on the weakly non - linear density wave theory of goodman & rafikov ( 2001 ) . in a global disk spanning a large range of radii , the amplitude and width of the n - shaped shock scale as @xmath147 and @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is given in equation 43 of rafikov ( 2002 ) . for our disk parameters ,",
    "we have @xmath150 since the middle point of the n - shaped shock is at @xmath1510 ( rafikov 2002 ) , we expect that in our global simulations the azimuthal distance between the shock front and the path predicted by equation [ eq : linearwake ] ( @xmath152=0 ) should also scales as @xmath148 .    to test this prediction , we have measured the shock positions at @xmath153 and 1.5 in figure [ fig : shockcut ] , which are @xmath154 and 0.43 respectively .",
    "these two positions are labeled as the dashed lines in @xmath153 and 1.5 panels .",
    "then we calculate the shock positions at @xmath138 and 2 to be -1.7 and 0.9 , using their positions at @xmath153 and 1.5 together with the scaling relationship @xmath148 where @xmath149 at @xmath64=0.3 , 0.5 , 1.5 , and 2 are calculated from equation [ eq : tf ] .",
    "these predicted shock positions are labeled as the dashed lines in @xmath138 and 2 panels .",
    "we can see that they agree with the actual shock positions in the simulation very well .",
    "this confirms that the shock positions are determined by the non - linear expansion of spiral shocks . using the same approach ,",
    "we have calculated the non - linear shock position at every radius for @xmath155 and @xmath156 with the normalization based on shock positions at @xmath153 and 1.5 .",
    "this new predicted shock shape is plotted as the dotted curve in the left panel of figure [ fig : shockcut ] . despite some offset at @xmath64 close to the planet , which is expected since the simple relationship @xmath147 holds only when",
    "@xmath1460 , a good agreement has been achieved between the non - linear density wave theory and the simulations .",
    "note that in this comparison , we did not calculate the shock strength directly from non - linear theory and compare its amplitude with simulations , instead we use the scaling relationship to verify the propagation of the shock . in future",
    ", direct comparison is desired when we have a more complete non - linear theory which can calculate the shock excitation directly .",
    "although the primary arm can be fitted by the weakly non - linear density wave theory , the excitation of the secondary ( or even tertiary ) arm still lacks a good theoretical explanation .",
    "it may be related to the low @xmath12 mode ( e.g. @xmath157 , @xmath158 , similar to disks in binary systems ) or some non - linear wave coupling .",
    "figure [ fig : shockcut ] suggests that a secondary spiral arm is excited at the other end of the n - shaped primary shock ( the @xmath153 panel ) . after it is excited , it steepens to shocks and becomes another n - shaped shock later ( the @xmath138 panel ) .",
    "its shock front can even travel into the rarefaction wave of the primary arm ( e.g. in the @xmath138 panel , the secondary shock is almost at @xmath152=0 where the rarefaction wave of the primary arm should reside . ) .",
    "unlike the primary arm which already dissipates when it travels inward from @xmath153 to 0.3 , this secondary arm is excited later and becomes stronger from @xmath153 to 0.3 . at @xmath138 ,",
    "the secondary arm is even stronger than the primary arm . by comparing @xmath153 and @xmath138 panels",
    ", we also notice that the secondary arm almost keeps the same azimuthal separation with the primary arm ( @xmath1591.7 ) during its propagation .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath138 , a tertiary arm starts to appear at the other end of the n - shaped secondary arm .",
    "to summarize the results in this section , figure [ fig : pitch ] shows the pitch angle from the linear theory and those measured in numerical simulations .",
    "when the planet mass is low ( e.g. cm1iso , the green dots ) , the measured pitch angle agrees with the linear theory .",
    "when the planet mass increases , the pitch angle also increases .",
    "for the 6 @xmath11 case , the measured pitch angle of the spiral wake in the @xmath160 disk is close to the pitch angle predicted in a much thicker disk ( @xmath161 ) using the linear theory .",
    "the secondary and even the tertiary arms have similar pitch angles as the primary arms .",
    "thus , if we know the disk thermal structure very well , we can use the deviation of the measured pitch angle from the linear theory to estimate the embedded planet mass .",
    "since near - ir scattered light observations only probe the shape of the disk surface , 3-d structure of spiral shocks can affect the observational signatures of these spiral shocks .",
    "intuitively , we would expect that the spiral shocks have complicated 3-d structure .",
    "first , the wave excitation must have 3-d structure since , at the same @xmath64 in the disk , the distance between the planet and the disk surface is larger than the distance at the midplane , and the force is thus weaker at the disk surface .",
    "second , the wave propagation may have 3-d structure considering the disk becomes thinner at smaller @xmath64 .",
    "waves / shocks are more converged when they propagate inwards .",
    "they can also channel to the disk surface ( lubow & ogilvie 1998 , bate et al .",
    "2002 , lee & gu 2015 ) , and , during their propagation from the high density region ( e.g. , the midplane ) to the low density region ( e.g. , the disk surface ) , the amplitudes of perturbations have to increase to conserve the wave action . since the amplitudes of perturbations determine when the waves will break into shocks , the dissipation can also be quite different between the surface and the midplane .",
    "all these effects can contribute to the 3-d structure of spiral waves / shocks .",
    "due to these complicated effects , it is difficult to develop an analytic theory to study the planet - induced 3-d shock structure , and we rely on numerical simulations to study such structure .",
    "however , before delving into the highly nonlinear shock regime , we can use the linear theory developed in tanaka , takeuchi & ward ( 2002 ) to estimate the 3-d effect of the density waves .",
    "following their theory for locally isothermal disks , the structure of the waves in the @xmath98 direction can be studied with hermite polynomials ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we first expand perturbed quantities ( @xmath163 ) from our simulations into fourier series @xmath164\\,,\\ ] ] where the fourier components @xmath165 are complex functions of @xmath64 and @xmath98 .",

    "is very similar to figure 2 in tanaka et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . by comparing the left and right panels in figure [ fig : m10 ]",
    ", we can see that although higher - order hermite components have similar strength between thin and thick disks , n=0 hermite component is much weaker in a thick disk , suggesting that the wakes in a thick disk have more significant 3-d structures than wakes in a thin disk .",

    "the density structure at the disk atmosphere can be significantly affected by higher - order vertical modes .",
    "although the modal analysis is useful to verify numerical simulations and can be suggestive on the relative amplitudes of various modes , it is the 3-d structure in the real space that determines the observational signatures of waves / shocks .    by studying the shock structure in real space , we first find that the 3-d shock structure is dramatically different between inner and outer arms . for the inner arms ,",
    "the density perturbation is much larger at the disk surface than at the disk midplane .",

    "the secondary inner spiral arms / shocks are also more prominent at the disk surface than at the disk midplane . at the disk midplane ,",
    "the secondary arms have lower amplitudes compared with the primary arms ( dotted curves in figure [ fig : onedr0p5 ] ) , while at @xmath113 , the secondary arms have almost the same amplitudes as the primary arms ( solid curves ) .",
    "the large amplitude of primary and secondary inner arms at the disk surface is due to the corrugated motion in the @xmath188 direction . in figure",

    ", @xmath188 also becomes negative , compressing the disk material at the midplane .",
    "this downward motion decreases the density of the rarefaction wave at @xmath113 . before meeting the secondary shock , @xmath188 starts to increase and becomes positive , leading to a higher density at the disk surface . at the secondary shock",
    ", @xmath188 reaches the maximum positive velocity and leads to the highest density at the disk surface for the secondary shock in figure [ fig : onedr0p5 ] .",
    "this corrugated motion , first negative and then positive @xmath188 , leads to an enhanced contrast between the spiral shock and the rarefaction wave after the shock .    on the other hand ,",
    "the density perturbation of outer spiral arms is similar between the disk surface and the disk midplane , especially for isothermal disks , as shown in figure [ fig : onedr2 ] . at @xmath191 , regardless of height , the differences between the maximum and minimum density in the logarithmic scale are both 0.002 for sm1iso , 0.1 for sm2iso , and 0.3 for sm3iso .",
    "this lack of vertical variation is also reflected in figure [ fig : vyr2 ] where @xmath188 is very small compared with @xmath192 ( @xmath188 is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath192 ) .",
    "thus , the density structure of the outer spiral is mainly determined by @xmath192 and @xmath116 in the horizontal plane in stead of the corrugated motion in the @xmath99 direction .    for non - isothermal runs ( bottom panels in figure [ fig : onedr2 ] ) ,",
    "the density perturbation of the outer spiral arms at the disk surface is slightly higher than the perturbation at the disk midplane .",

    "when it meets the shock , it develops a @xmath188 towards the disk surface , which enhances the density at the disk surface .",
    "although it is tempting to contribute such difference between isothermal and non - isothermal runs to the nonlinear hydraulic jumps ( shock bores ) ( boley & durisen 2006 ) , such disk structure also appears even in the linear regime for the 0.01 @xmath11 case , implying that it may be a linear effect and related to the eigenfunctions of the 3-d waves excited by the planet .    finally , to illustrate the increase of the density perturbation with height in disks and the qualitative difference between inner and outer arms , we plot the relative density perturbation along the radius at different heights ( @xmath1930 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 @xmath94 ) in figures [ fig : denmaxmin ] and [ fig : denmaxmintc1 ] .",

    "overall , for the inner arms , the large density perturbation at the disk surface has a significant effect on the near - ir observations as shown below .",

    "when a gap is induced at 120 orbits , the spiral shocks become weaker at the disk region close to the gap , while it still maintains the same strength at the region far away from the gap .",
    "we notice that vortices start to develop at the outer gap edge ( @xmath199 ) at 120 orbits , which slightly enhances the density perturbation at the outer gap edge .",

    "when the disk is viewed face - on , both full intensity and polarized intensity images are almost identical except that the full intensity image is almost a factor of 2 brighter than the polarized intensity image .",
    "the polarization fraction , which is defined as the ratio between the polarized intensity and full intensity , is almost a constant ( @xmath10.45 ) .",
    "when the disk is viewed at some inclination angle , the polarization fraction is not a constant due to the dust forward scattering .",
    "the dependence of the polarization fraction on disk inclination can be useful to determine the disk inclination angle .    to highlight the importance of the 3-d wave structure , we have also computed models by only using the disk midplane density from simulations , which is labeled as 2d@xmath2053d in figures [ fig : image1mj ] and [ fig : image6mj ] . in these models , we assume that the disk is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and puff up the midplane density to higher altitudes as @xmath206 where @xmath207 ( the same as the scale height used in 3-d simulations ) .",
    "figures [ fig : image1mj ] and [ fig : image6mj ] show that , in 3d models , the inner arms are considerably more prominent than the outer arms , and normally a secondary arm can be as bright as the primary arm .",
    "the shape of the inner arms clearly deviate from the prediction of linear theory . as expected from the non - linear expansion of spiral shocks , the pitch angle of the inner spiral arms in the more massive planet case ( sm3iso , figure [ fig : image6mj ] )",
    "is larger than those in the less massive planet case ( sm2iso , figure [ fig : image1mj ] ) .",
    "the inner arms are also quite sharp , while the outer arms are quite broad and sometimes indistinguishable from the background disk .",
    "this difference is partly because the sharp shock fronts are facing the star for the inner arms , while they are facing away from the star for the outer arms .",
    "the different geometry at the disk surface can greatly affect the intensity of the scattered light images ( takami et al .",
    "we calculate an approximate scattering surface , defined as the disk surface where the column density is 0.01 ( in code units ) , for the sm3iso model at @xmath208 , shown in figure [ fig : scattering ] .",
    "clearly , for the inner arms , the shock fronts are facing the star , while , for the outer arms , the smooth rarefaction waves are facing the star .",
    "since the rarefaction waves change gradually with radius , they are illuminated by the star more uniformly than the shock .",
    "thus , the outer arms appear quite broad . however , when the planet mass is not very high ( 1 m@xmath209 case ) , the width of rarefaction waves in the radial direction can be smaller than the size of the observational beam , and we wo nt be able to distinguish the inner and outer arms based on the sharpness of the arms .    in 3-d models of figure [ fig : image1mj ] and [ fig :",
    "image6mj ] , the secondary inner arms are as apparent as the primary arms , even though the primary arms have higher surface density than secondary arms .",
    "this is due to the corrugated motion discussed above in figure [ fig : onedr0p5 ] and [ fig : vyr0p5 ] , which increases the density of the secondary arms at the disk surface .",
    "the secondary arm is offset from the primary arm with some azimuthal angle , as also shown in the surface density plot ( figure [ fig : shock ] ) .",
    "this offset is smaller in sm1iso ( figure [ fig : image1mj ] ) than that in sm6iso ( figure [ fig : image6mj ] ) .",
    "the two spiral arms are @xmath210 apart in sm1iso ( figure [ fig : image1mj ] ) , while almost 180@xmath211 apart in the more massive planet case ( sm6iso , figure [ fig : image6mj ] ) .    by comparing 3d models with 2d@xmath2053d models in figure [ fig : image1mj ] and [ fig : image6mj ] , we find that the inner spiral arms are more prominent in 3d models , as expected due to inner arms higher density perturbation at the disk surface in 3d models ( figure [ fig : denmaxmin ] ) . even in convolved images ,",
    "the polarized intensity of inner arms is at least twice stronger in 3d models than in 2d@xmath2053d models .",
    "the outer shocks are not very apparent , and they are similar between 3d and 2d@xmath2053d models since the density perturbation of outer arms is almost height independent (  5 ) . as discussed in  4 , the outer arms coincidently follow linear theory ( equation [ eq : linearwake ] ) .",
    "when the planet mass is very large as in figure [ fig : image6mj ] , the secondary outer arm starts to become visible .",
    "another noticeable difference between 3d and 2d@xmath2053d models is that the planet ( or the circumplanetary region ) is bright in 2d@xmath2053d models while it is dim in 3d models .",
    "this is because , when we puff the disk from 2-d to 3-d , we have ignored the planet s gravity so that the higher density in the circumplanetary region leads to the higher density at the disk surface .",
    "the circumplanetary region even casts a shadow to the outer disk in 2d@xmath2053d models . in realistic 3-d models ,",
    "the gravity of the planet has been self - consistently included , which pulls the circumplanetary material towards the disk midplane and leads to a lower density at the disk surface .",
    "thus , the circumplanetary region receives less irradiation by the central star , and becomes dark . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer disk beyond the planet is better illuminated and thus becomes bright instead of being shadowed",
    ".    however , we need to keep in mind that we have ignored the luminosity from the planet and the circumplanetary disk in our models .",
    "zhu ( 2015 ) point out that accreting circumplanetary disks can be very bright ( @xmath10.001 @xmath8 if the circumplanetary disk accepts onto jupiter at a rate @xmath212 ) .",
    "such high luminosity may be able to illuminate the circumplanetary region significantly",
    ". we may also be able to directly detect such accreting circumplanetary disks in direct imaging observations operating at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "previous works suggest that spiral patterns from direct imaging observations can not be explained by planet - induced spiral arms , since the pitch angle of the spiral arm is larger in observations than that predicted by the linear spiral wave theory , and the contrast of the spiral arm is higher in observations than suggested by the synthetic observations based on two dimensional planet - disk simulations . however , most previous works only focus on using outer spiral arms beyond the planet to explain observed spiral patterns . as shown in figure [ fig : pitch ] ,",
    "the inner arms generally have larger pitch angle than outer arms even under the linear density wave theory .",
    "furthermore , when the spiral arms become spiral shocks , the pitch angle increases with stronger shocks .",
    "we also found that a secondary ( or even a tertiary ) spiral arm , especially for the inner arms , is also excited by a massive planet .",
    "the more massive is the planet , the larger is the separation in the azimuthal direction between the primary and secondary arms .",
    "the inner arms also have significant vertical motion , which boosts the density perturbation at the disk surface and the intensity contrast in synthetic images .",
    "thus , we have three independent ways to estimate the planet mass based on the spiral patterns in observations : 1 ) using the deviation between the measured pitch angle and the pitch angle predicted in the linear theory ( figure [ fig : pitch ] ) ; 2 ) the existence of the secondary spiral arm and the separation between two arms ( figure [ fig : shock ] ) ; 3 ) the intensity contrast of the spiral arms in observation ( figure [ fig : image1mj ] & [ fig : image6mj ] ) .",
    "the first two methods only use the information on the shape of the spiral arms and are less likely to be affected by the disk vertical temperature structure . in a companion paper ( dong et al .",
    "2015 ) , we have shown that all these three methods suggest that sao 206462 and mwc 758 may harbor massive planets ( several to tens of jupiter masses ) outside the detected spiral arms .",
    "the planet - induced spiral arms can efficiently scatter light from the central star and are quite bright within gaps ( figure [ fig : image6mjfull ] ) .",
    "the spiral arms may be responsible for some resolved infrared features within the cavity of lkca 15 ( kraus & ireland 2012 ) .",
    "we have carried out two dimensional ( 2-d ) and three dimensional ( 3-d ) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes / shocks excited by young planets .",
    "simulations with different planet masses ( 0.01 , 1 , and 6 @xmath11 ) and different equations of state ( isothermal and adiabatic ) have been carried out .    *",
    "we find that the linear density wave theory can only explain the shape of the spiral wakes excited by a very low mass planet ( e.g. 0.01 @xmath11 ) .",
    "spiral shocks excited by high mass planets clearly deviate from the prediction of linear theory . for a more massive planet ,",
    "the deviation is more significant and the pitch angle of the spiral arms becomes larger .",
    "this phenomenon can be nicely explained by the wake broadening from the non - linear density wave theory ( goodman & rafikov 2001 , rafikov 2002 ) .",
    "a more massive planet excites a stronger shock which expands more quickly , leading to a larger pitch angle . *",
    "a secondary ( or even tertiary ) inner spiral arm is also excited by the planet .",
    "it seems to be excited at the edge of the n - shaped primary arm .",
    "the more massive is the planet , the larger is the separation between the primary and secondary arm . at the disk surface",
    ", the secondary inner arm can be as strong as the primary arm .",
    "the secondary inner arm almost keeps the same azimuthal separation with the primary arm at every radius in the disk . the excitation mechanism for the secondary ( tertiary )",
    "arm deserves further study . *",
    "the spiral shocks have significant 3-d structure .",
    "they are not perpendicular to the disk midplane .",
    "they are curled towards the star at the disk surface .",
    "this further increases the pitch angle of the inner arms at the disk surface , but reduces the pitch angle of the outer arms at the disk surface . for outer arms",
    ", this effect compensates the increased pitch angle due to wake broadening . eventually at the disk surface , the shape of outer spiral arms still roughly follows the prediction of linear theory , while the inner arms are considerably more opened than predicted by the linear theory .",
    "* the inner spiral shocks also have significant vertical motion .",
    "the corrugated motion increases the density perturbation of the inner spiral arms by more than a factor of 10 at @xmath213 compared with the perturbation at the disk midplane .",
    "this can dramatically increase the contrast of the spiral patterns in near - ir scattered light images .",
    "the outer spiral shocks have little vertical motion in isothermal disks . with a non - isothermal eos , there are some vertical motions for the outer arms , which can make the outer arms more apparent .",
    "* we have combined our hydrodynamical simulations with monte - carlo radiative transfer calculations to generate near - ir scattered light images .",
    "we find that the inner spiral arms are prominent features that are observable by current near - ir imaging facilities .",
    "besides the apparent spiral patterns in some transitional disks , planet - induced spiral arms may also be responsible to some marginally detected near - ir features within cavity of some transitional disks .",
    "we further demonstrate that inner spiral arms in synthetic near - ir images using full 3-d hydrodynamical models are much more prominent than those based on 2-d models assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , consistent with the 3-d structure of the inner arms . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer shocks are not very apparent and they are similar in synthetic images using 3d and 2d models .",
    "this indicates the need to model observations ( especially for inner arms ) with full 3-d hydrodynamics . *",
    "the different geometry between the inner and outer arms also affects their appearance in near - ir images .",
    "the sharp shock fronts of the inner arms face the central star directly , producing sharp narrow spiral features in observations . on the other hand , for the outer arms ,",
    "the smooth rarefaction waves face the central star , producing broad and dimmer spiral features . * in near - ir images , the circumplanetary region is very dim since the planetary gravity reduces the density at the disk atmosphere .",
    "however , the disk region behind the planet can be better illuminated and becomes bright .    in the appendix , we have shown that buoyancy resonances are confirmed in global adiabatic simulations even if the disk has a moderate cooling rate .",
    "they can lead to sharp density ridges around the planet , which may have observational signatures .",
    "overall , spiral arms ( especially inner arms ) excited by low mass companions are prominent features in near - ir scattered light images .",
    "most importantly , we have three independent ways to infer the companion s mass : 1 ) the pitch angle of the spiral patterns , 2 ) the separation between the primary and secondary arms , and 3 ) the contrast of the spiral patterns .    in a companion paper ( dong et al .",
    "2015 ) , we have combined mcrt and hydrodynamical simulations from this paper , and shown that planet - induced inner arms can explain spiral patterns revealed by recent near - ir direct imaging observations for sao 206462 and mwc 758 . we want to caution that our proposed model can not explain the gaps at the inner disks",
    ". other mechanisms ( e.g. another planet or disk photoevaporation ) have to be invoked to explain the inner gaps .    all hydrodynamical simulations are carried out using computer supported by the princeton institute of computational science and engineering , and the texas advanced computing center ( tacc ) at the university of texas at austin through xsede grant tg- ast130002 . this project is supported by nasa through hubble fellowship grants hst - hf-51333.01-a ( z.z . ) and hst - hf-51320.01-a ( r.d . )",
    "awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", for nasa , under contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "the inner and outer spiral shocks are due to the steepening of spiral density waves which are excited by the planet at lindblad resonances . at lindblad resonances ,",
    "the doppler shifted frequency matches the disk epicyclic frequency ( @xmath214 ) and density waves are excited .",
    "however , besides the epicyclic frequency , the disk also has other natural frequencies . when the disk is not strictly isothermal , it has a non - zero brunt - visl frequency @xmath215 where @xmath216 . matching the brunt - visl frequency with the doppler shifted frequency ,",
    "we have @xmath217 given a @xmath12 , equation ( [ eq : buoy ] ) gives the position of the resonances .",
    "these buoyancy resonances were discovered in shearing box simulations ( zhu , stone , & rafikov 2012 ) and studied analytically in lubow & zhu ( 2014 ) .",
    "they have significant contributions to the planetary torque , especially around the planet , which may affect planet migration .",
    "these resonances are infinitely thin , and no waves are excited to carry the deposited angular momentum and energy away .",
    "their dissipation relies on microscopic viscosity or radiative cooling .",
    "thin density ridges with large temperature and velocity variations appear at these resonances .",
    "when various @xmath12 modes overlap with each other , we can roughly estimate the position of the final density ridges caused by buoyancy resonances following equation 10 and 11 in zhu et al .",
    "first , given a @xmath12 , we can calculate the corresponding resonance position at @xmath64 and @xmath98 . then using the azimuthal wavelength for this mode @xmath218 , the geometric location of the constant phase @xmath219 ( @xmath173 is integer )",
    "is given by @xmath220 ( assuming the phase of buoyancy waves is 0 at the planet position . ) .",
    "thus , @xmath221    we plot temperature fluctuations and @xmath188 at @xmath222 for sm1t1 in figure [ fig : buoy ] . the positions of buoyancy resonances given by equation ( [ eq : buoyt ] ) are plotted with dotted lines / curves . figure [ fig : buoy ] shows that both temperature fluctuations and @xmath188 are nicely tracked by equation ( [ eq : buoyt ] ) , suggesting that buoyancy resonances exist in disks even with @xmath62 .",
    "even though buoyancy resonances can affect planet migration , they may not be observed through direct imaging technique since the density fluctuations caused by these resonances are much weaker than the spiral density waves excited by lindblad resonances .",
    "for example , in the @xmath136 panels of figure [ fig : shocktc1 ] , we can see some density fluctuations close to the corotation region ( especially for sm2t1 , the 1 @xmath11 case ) , but they are much weaker than the spiral shocks",
    ".    these buoyancy resonances also have vertical structure , as shown in figure [ fig : temp2d ] .",
    "we sliced through the disk at a fixed @xmath92 , and the buoyancy resonance curves are plotted as dotted curves in figure [ fig : temp2d ] . at the disk midplane , @xmath223 and there are no buoyancy resonances . since @xmath224 increases with disk height , @xmath225 also needs to increase with height to match the brunt - visl frequency considering @xmath226 and m are the same at the same @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the curves move away from the planet position towards the disk atmosphere ."
