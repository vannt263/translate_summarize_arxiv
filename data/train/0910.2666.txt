    "the longitudinal diffusion constant is found to drop from weak to strong coupling like @xmath4 .",
    "the shear viscosity is found to reach a minimum for @xmath6 of about 8 .",
    "the large increase at weak coupling is the result of the large mean free paths and encoded in the direct or driving part of the connected self - energy .",
    "the minimum at intermediate @xmath6 is tied with the onset of hydrodynamics which reflects on the liquid nature of the colored coulomb plasma in this regime .    at larger values of @xmath6 an su(2 )",
    "crystal forms as reported in  @xcite .",
    "our current analysis should be able to account for the emergence of elasticities , with in particular an elastic shear mode .",
    "this point will be pursued in a future investigation .",
    "the many body analysis presented in this work treats the color degrees of freedom as massive constituents with a finite mass and a classical su(2 ) color charge .",
    "the dynamical analysis is fully non - classical . in a way ,",
    "quantum mechanics is assumed to generate the constituent degrees of freedom with their assigned parameters . while this picture is supported by perturbation theory at very weak coupling ,",
    "its justification at strong coupling is by no means established .",
    "this work was supported in part by us doe grants de - fg02 - 88er40388 and de - fg03 - 97er4014 .",
    "a useful parametrization of the su(2 ) color phase space is through the canonical variables @xmath190     @xmath191    with @xmath192 being a constraint variable fixed by @xmath193 or the quadratic casimir with @xmath194",
    ". the conjugate set @xmath195 obeys standard poisson bracket .",
    "the associated phase space measure is    @xmath196    where @xmath197 is a representation dependent constant .",
    "a simpler parametrization of the phase space is to use    @xmath198    with the normalizations @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "the su(2 ) casimir is then restored by inspection .",
    "if we define the phase space density , @xmath202    @xmath203    we can construct structure factor @xmath204 for @xmath85th partial wave    @xmath205    here a scalar product @xmath206 is defined as @xmath207 . we follow   and recast the formal liouville equation ( [ res ] ) in the form of a formal eigenvalue - like equation in phase space    @xmath208    the color charge effect by partial waves is represented as @xmath209 in eq .",
    "( [ eq003e ] ) .",
    "if we introduce the projection operator    @xmath210    we can check that this projection operator satisfies @xmath211    @xmath212    because of the translational invariance in space and the rotational invariance in color space ,    @xmath213    the off - diagonal elemenets vanish in the equilibrium averaging due to phase incoherence .",
    "therefore , the projection operator in eq .",

    "therefore @xmath223 . with these in mind",
    ", we can modify the above equation further using @xmath224    @xmath225    from these equations , we can extract    @xmath226    by multiplying @xmath227 we finally obtain ,    @xmath228    where the memory function , or the evolution operator @xmath229 is    @xmath230    with    @xmath231    since the liouville operator @xmath232 can be split into @xmath233 , eq .",
    "( [ liou1 ] ) , the evolution operator can also be split into four terms ; the free streaming term(@xmath234 ) , the self consistent term(@xmath235 ) , the color charge term(@xmath236 ) and the non - local collision term(@xmath237 ) .",
    "in this appendix we detail the calculation that leads to a zero contribution from the colored liouville operator in the collisional part of the self energy in the free streaming approximation . a typical contribution to ( [ st4 ] ) and ( [ st6 ] ) is    @xmath239    which can be reduced to    @xmath240    the derivatives on @xmath77 and @xmath241 are on their color argument .",
    "we note that ( [ e2 ] ) contribute to the collisional part of the self energy in ( [ eq006s ] ) after the integration over @xmath242 and @xmath243 , which is then zero .",
    "this is expected .",
    "indeed , the colored liouville operator is a 3-body force that requires 3 distinct color charges to not vanish . while ( [ e2 ] ) contributer to the unintegrated collisional operator , it does not in the integrated one which is the self - energy on the 2point function",
    ". it does contribute in the liouville hierarchy in the 3-body structure factors and higher .",
    "the projection method onto the hydrodynamical subspace has been discussed by many  .",
    "this consists in dialing the projector in ( [ k1 ] ) onto the hydrodynamical modes .",
    "we choose hermite polynomials as a basis set with the maxwell - boltzman distribution @xmath244 as a gaussian weight function .",
    "the hermite polynomials are the the generalized ones in 3d  @xcite . specifically          here @xmath247 and @xmath248 set the normalizations .",

    "the transverse directional is chosen orthogonal to @xmath251 , @xmath252 with a unit vector satisfying @xmath253 and @xmath254 .        while in general these 5 statesare enough to characterize the hydrodynamical modes in the su(2 ) phase space , we need additional states to work out the shear viscosity as it involves in general correlations in the stress tensor through the kubo relation  .",
