    "<S> we find the correspondence between the helicity of these edge states and the polarization of photons , and thus named them as the maxwell edge modes in this so - called topological maxwell insulator . in particular , we reveal that this system exhibits an analogous quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite , with the edge modes being strong spin - momentum locking as eigenstates of the spin operator @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the two bunches of quasiparticle streams on the two edges can be treated as the streams of polarized maxwell quasiparticles moving along the @xmath31 axis .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ edgemode](a ) , we numerically calculate the expectation value @xmath113 with the wave functions of the 2d lattice with @xmath105 . </S>",

    "<S> it indicates that just the two edge states for each edge are the eigenstates of @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states on the @xmath116 edge with positive eigenvalue are @xmath117 , and the ones on the @xmath118 edge with negative eigenvalue are @xmath119 , where @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) are the unit vectors of cartesian coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the effective hamiltonian of edge states is given by @xmath122 this effective hamiltonian is nothing but the one - dimensioanl maxwell hamiltonian of circularly - polarized quasiparticles . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the edge quasiparticle - streams in this maxwell topological insulator can be treated as maxwell quasiparticle - streams with the same helicity @xmath125 for opposite momenta , which satisfies the helicity conservation of massless photons in quantum field theory , as shown in fig . [ edgemode](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the momentum @xmath126 can also be considered as the wave vector of the plane electromagnetic wave propagated along the @xmath31 axis , both of the edge states @xmath109 @xmath127 and @xmath110 @xmath128 with same helicity can be regarded as right circularly - polarized waves which consist of the two independent transverse polarization vectors @xmath129 and @xmath130 with opposite momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ edgemode](c ) that the maxwell edge modes moving along @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) direction correspond to the right circularly - polarized waves rotating anticlockwise ( clockwise ) in the @xmath133 plane ( if one looks along the @xmath132 axis ) propagated along @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , for the case @xmath134 with the chern number @xmath135 , the maxwell - edge modes on the @xmath116 ( @xmath118 ) edge with @xmath136 are corresponding to the left circularly - polarized waves propagated along @xmath132 ( @xmath131 ) direction similar to the schematic diagram in fig . [ edgemode](c ) </S>",
    "<S> . because the electromagnetic waves are transverse waves , there is no longitudinal component and thus no edge mode with the helicity @xmath137 , which corresponds to the unit wave vector of plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> so , the maxwell edge modes here with such strong spin - momentum locking perfectly correspond to the circularly - polarized photons .    _ discussions and conclusion. </S>",
    "<S> _ we now address some possible concerns on the realistic cold - atom experiments . in our proposed ol scheme for implementing the model hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) , the major difficulty is to realize the spin - flip hopping terms along each direction , which will involves a number of raman beams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of the lasers can be drawn from the same one with the small relative frequency shift induced by an acoustic optical modulator . </S>",
    "<S> the maxwell points in the band structures with the related topological phase transition can be detected from the bragg spectroscopy or bloch - zener oscillations , similar to the methods for detecting dirac point in ols @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the berry curvature and thus the chern numbers ( berry phases ) can be measured by the newly - developed technique of tomography of bloch band in ols @xcite , and the chern numbers can also be revealed from the shift of the hybrid wannier center of an atomic cloud @xcite .    in summary , we have explored the topological properties of maxwell quasiparticles emerged in maxwell metals and maxwell insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model could be realized in ols and the exotic properties of these topological quasiparticles can be detected in cold - atom experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the properties of the topological maxwell quasiparticles analogous to the dirac and weyl fermions can be further investigated , such as wave dynamics of the maxwell fermions by studying the relativistic zitterbewegung oscillations @xcite or klein tunneling @xcite in the maxwell insulators , the transport properties of the maxwell fermions and so forth .    </S>",
