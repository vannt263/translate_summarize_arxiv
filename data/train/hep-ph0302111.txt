    "physicists have been delighted by the extraordinary success of the standard model ( sm ) , while many got frustrated by the lack of experimental clues for the construction of the theory beyond .",
    "the most recent measurement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath4 @xcite revealed a plausible deviation as large as @xmath5 from the sm prediction , as suggested by the papers in ref.@xcite .",
    "while such a scenario is only a favorable , rather than unquestionably established , conclusion from the analyses , it has been taken by some physicists as a strong suggestion for physics beyond the sm .",
    "deviation was derived using the @xmath6 data .",
    "if the @xmath7 decay data are used , the deviation would be reduced to about @xmath8 @xcite , which , however , has model dependence and thus less reliable . ] since many extensions of the sm are capable of giving rise to such a deviation , theorists , typically , would like to check the constraints imposed on the parameter space of a specific model .",
    "such constraints are particularly interesting , because they are likely to give information not only on excluded regions but also on the predictions for where else should other evidences on the model be expected .",
    "for example , one expects to find a lower bound on the mass of a new particle playing the role on generating the extra contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "the information has especially strong implications on models that have a small number of parameters which are already stringently constrained by various precision electroweak data .",
    "we present here such a case study , illustrating how far such a @xmath5 deviation can take us .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm is the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , which adds one higgs doublet in addition to the one required in the sm .",
    "a generic 2hdm allows flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , which can be avoided by restricting the couplings of the doublets , say , by imposing an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry@xcite .",
    "the most popular version , known as model ii , has one higgs doublet coupled to the down - type quarks ( and charged leptons ) and the second doublet to the up - type quarks .",
    "the physical content of the higgs sector ( assuming no cp violation ) includes a pair of cp - even neutral higgs bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , a cp - odd neutral boson @xmath11 , and a pair of charged - higgs bosons @xmath12 .",
    "the model fits in well with the criteria mentioned above for the @xmath4 result to have a very strong impact .",
    "we focus on the 2hdm ii in this paper , answering the question of to what extent the model can survive a requirement of generating the @xmath13 deviation in @xmath14 , as suggested .",
    "the 2hdm ii has been extensively studied in literature and tested experimentally .",
    "one of the most stringent tests is the radiative decay of @xmath15 mesons , specifically , the inclusive decay rate of @xmath16 , which has the least hadronic uncertainties . in the 2hdm , the rate of @xmath1 can be enhanced substantially for large regions in the parameter space of the mass @xmath17 of the charged - higgs boson and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the vacuum expectation values of the down- and up - sector higgs doublets , respectively ) .",
    "an earlier analysis has already put a constraint on the charged - higgs boson mass at @xmath21 gev@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "updating the constraint while asking for the model to give rise to the @xmath4 deviation as suggested already imposes a strong and specific mass hierarchy between the pseudoscalar and the charged scalar .",
    "electroweak precision data also have strong implications on the model .",
    "the 2hdm can explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment deviation with a light pseudoscalar boson @xmath11 contributing via a 2-loop barr - zee - type diagram @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in updating a previous analysis@xcite and extending it to a comprehensive treatment of all the relevant constraints .",
    "the opal collaboration @xcite has recently published an update on their search for the higgs bosons within the 2hdm framework . since their result is more stringent than before , by combining the updated constraints from @xmath4 and other precision measurements , such as the @xmath3 parameter , @xmath2 , and the @xmath1 rate , together with this new opal result and a study on yukawa processes from delphi @xcite , we are able to limit the 2hdm to a tiny window of parameter space with an , perhaps , uncomfortably large value of @xmath22 .",
    "all in all , we will piece together a story of the very stringently constrained 2hdm , almost to the extent of killing it altogether .",
    "we note that there have been previous analyses on the 2hdm using the electroweak precision data @xcite , to which we are partially in debt .",
    "our study here can be considered an update , with a presentation along a different line .",
    "we are here talking about the intricate interplay of a few stringent constraints on the overall parameter space of the model .",
    "it is not a simple matter to illustrate results on the space of a large number ( six , as discussed in the next section ) of parameters . in our opinion ,",
    "the best way to do it may depend on how each of the constraints really works .",
    "our presentation of the constraints follows what we consider the most efficient way to appreciate the overall results",
    ". it may be not very conventional , but is considered particularly illustrative . wherever explicit plots are shown ,",
    "we are typically plotting two- parameter fits of one or more constraints , based on the usual @xmath23-analysis .",
    "we will show @xmath24 regions , corresponding to @xmath25 deviation limits , which we consider as `` solution '' regions  where the 2hdm survives the particular constraints .",
    "we will also show regions where the model fits better than the sm , wherever appropriate .",
    "the organization is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the 2hdm ( ii ) and the relevant parameters used in our analysis . in sec .",
    "iii , we look at the @xmath1 rate and the @xmath26 mixing , which require a heavy charged higgs boson . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the higgs - sector contributions to @xmath4 and @xmath2 , and show the strongly complementary character of the two data and how that plays off in the 2hdm .",
    "we give our fits to the data , with the exclusions from delphi and opal further imposed . in sec .",
    "v , we add the consideration of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "we conclude in sec .  vi .",
    "we take the parameter space of the model as given by a set of six higgs - sector parameters @xmath27 here , the first four are masses of the physical higgs states .",
    "the last one , @xmath28 , is the real scalar higgs mixing angle as defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we are taking this set of six parameters as mutually independent experimental parameters . from the theoretical point of view , one has parameters in the scalar potential from which the above can be derived .",
    "however , without supersymmetry or anything else to avoid the hierarchy problem , the masses for the higgs states suffer from quadratic divergences .",
    "the tree - level relations among parameters are modified substantially by loop corrections which depend on the renormalization approach and the cut - off imposed . to stay away from such uncertainties",
    ", we do not discuss the scalar potential here , except noting that there are enough degrees of freedom in the model in general , and especially with the loop corrections taken into account , to allow us to take the above six parameters as mutually independent .",
    "here we only consider the 2hdm - ii without cp - violation , and are not interested in couplings among the higgs states .",
    "it is then obvious that we do not have to consider more than the six parameters .",
    "it should be noted that any substantial cp violation in the higgs sector that may largely invalidate our analysis here is ruled out by the electron electric dipole moment constraint .",
    "the four physical masses are direct experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "the other two parameters , @xmath22 and the angle @xmath28 , come into the game as effective couplings .",
    "the yukawa couplings of @xmath29 , and @xmath11 to up- and down - type quarks are given by , with a common factor of @xmath30 , @xmath31 while the charged higgs @xmath32 couples to @xmath33 and @xmath34 via @xmath35 \\;.\\ ] ] from the perspective of our study here , the couplings given above may be considered as defining implicitly the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath28 .",
    "other relevant couplings in our study are those to gauge bosons , as given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the 4-momenta going into the vertex .",
    "it has been well appreciated that @xmath15 physics bars the 2hdm from admitting a relatively light charged - higgs state .",
    "we first review the constraints here .",
    "the first important constraint comes from the inclusive @xmath39 result , and the second one comes from the @xmath26 mixing .",
    "the essential point here is that without a direct source of fcnc , the charged higgs mediates the only significant contributions to flavor - changing processes , in addition to the @xmath40-mediated sm process .",

    "in fact , we had performed an analysis @xcite along the line for the earlier data .",

    "the opal analysis is limited to @xmath22 value at or below @xmath137 , while the delphi analysis stops at @xmath146 .",
    "the very large @xmath22 region is theoretically unfavorable and may provide practical problems due to the much enhanced @xmath100-quark yukawa coupling , which signals a breakdown of the perturbative treatment .",
    "nevertheless , we will include some results from such uncomfortably large @xmath22 values , and urge the opal group to push on a bit further in their analysis .    for @xmath147",
    ", we again illustrate some results for @xmath141 and @xmath139 in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , in which we still put in the ( no longer exactly valid ) opal exclusion from the @xmath148 scan for reference . for the @xmath149 case",
    ", the @xmath4-@xmath2 solution regions never rise above @xmath150 ( as also for the smaller @xmath22 cases ) , and partially excluded by delphi .",
    "there seem to be good enough reasons to believe that such low higgs mass regions should be excluded by the available lep data if an analysis along the opal line is performed .",
    "the @xmath142 case is better .",
    "the surviving region seen at @xmath113 moved further to the right , towards larger @xmath101 , and further up a bit for larger @xmath106 .",
    "the rise in @xmath106 actually more or less saturates at @xmath151 , and falls for even larger values of @xmath22 .",
    "such a region still lives at the boundary of the delphi exclusion , but would still have a surviving part even if the opal exclusion can still be imposed .",
    "the region is , however , shrinking with increases in @xmath22 , due to a more fine - tuned @xmath4-@xmath2 solution .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the ( upward ) shifting , and hence slight enlargement , of this solution region with a further increase in the @xmath17 value . for this purpose , we give the charged - higgs contribution to @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] .",
    "let us summarize our results so far .",
    "we have seen that combining the suggested requirement of producing a definite positive contribution to @xmath4 while keeping a limited deviation from the sm @xmath2 result is an extremely stringent constraint on the parameter space of the 2hdm .",
    "when the available direct experimental search results from the lep experiments are further implemented , there is at most a tiny window of parameter space that can survive .",
    "the apparently surviving region from the above discussions is restricted to very large values of @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , it may be already uncomfortably large , inviting the problem of the perturbativity of the yukawa coupling of the @xmath100 quark .",
    "as for the mixing angle @xmath28 , it is being pushed close to the @xmath126 region .",
    "all these are based on a strong mass splitting between the charged higgs and the light scalars , with the pseudoscalar @xmath11 lying typically below @xmath152 and the scalar @xmath10 below @xmath153 .",
    "recall that we have essentially decoupled the heavy higgs boson @xmath9 in the above analysis .",
    "we promised to justify this as a physics requirement .",
    "we first noted that a not too heavy @xmath9 would more or less add to the effect of the other real scalar @xmath10 in the contributions to @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "so , we expect it to ask for a larger mass splitting when fitting @xmath4 is concerned , but a smaller mass splitting to fit @xmath2 . in another word , further tightening of the apparent solution window . in the section",
    "below , we will show that fitting another precision ew parameter , the @xmath3 parameter , actually does require sending @xmath116 to a very large value , indeed well beyond @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 was introduced to measure the relation between the masses of @xmath40 and @xmath91 bosons . in the sm @xmath154 at tree - level .",
    "however , the @xmath3 parameter receives contributions from the sm corrections and from new physics .",
    "the deviation from the sm prediction is usually described by the parameter @xmath155 defined by@xcite @xmath156 where the @xmath3 in the denominator absorbs all the sm corrections , including the corrections from the top quark and the sm higgs boson . by definition ,",
    "@xmath157 in the sm .",
    "sources of new physics that contribute to @xmath155 can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 in our case .",
    "note that since the two - doublet higgs sector ( in the 2hdm ) is employed here to replace the sm higgs , the latter contribution to @xmath160 has to be subtracted out .",
    "the most recent reported value of @xmath155 is @xcite @xmath161 in terms of new physics the constraint becomes : @xmath162 in 2hdm @xmath160 receives contributions from all higgs bosons given by @xcite @xmath163    \\nonumber \\\\ & &    + \\sin^2\\!(\\beta -\\alpha ) \\ , [ f(m_{\\ !",

    "first of all , we note that @xmath165 has a negative value with magnitude increasing with @xmath166",
    ". as to be expected from above , the value is about @xmath167 at @xmath168 .",
    "it has a relatively mild variation , and does not go beyond @xmath169 even as @xmath166 gets to @xmath170 .",
    "in direct contrast , the other contributions to @xmath171 in the above formula are very sensitive to the masses involved .",
    "the @xmath172 function is always positive , vanishes only at @xmath173 , and increases with a faster and faster rate with the splitting between @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in a typical scenario that is of interest here",
    ", we expect the pseudoscalar to be the lightest higgs state with a quite heavy charged higgs .",
    "that makes the contribution from the first term [ involving @xmath176 large ; indeed of order @xmath177 for @xmath178 satisfying the lower bound from @xmath1 and @xmath179 mixing . to get the required almost zero value of @xmath171 , we need some negative contributions from the terms involving @xmath180 $ ] and @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "and the solution is obviously a fine - tuned one .",
    "consider a case of degenerated higgs real scalars , @xmath182 .",
    "the @xmath183 dependence in the formula is removed as the sine - square and cosine - square parts are combined .",
    "we need @xmath184 $ ] to have a negative value close in magnitude to that of @xmath185 .",
    "the former is obviously positive roughly when @xmath166 is closer to @xmath186 than @xmath178 , and negative when it is the other way round ; and it can be larger than @xmath185 only for @xmath187 .",
    "the @xmath183 dependence comes back in the generic situation , with a mass splitting between the two real scalars .",
    "obviously , at least one of them , by definition @xmath9 , has to be heavy .",
    "however , they can not be both heavy , because the @xmath2 constraint does not allow only a light pseudoscalar giving a substantial contribution .",
    "hence , this additional requirement of a limited splitting between @xmath186 and @xmath106 clearly suggests a large @xmath188 , typically larger than @xmath178 .",
    "the larger the @xmath188 value , the smaller the @xmath189 is required .",
    "admissible solutions , though fine - tuned , can be obtained so long as the required @xmath189 falls into the legitimate interval .",
    "a large splitting between @xmath188 and @xmath106 also resulted in a very narrow range of admissible @xmath183 values , and hence the @xmath28 values at a fixed @xmath22 of interest .",
    "our numerical results corroborate well with the above analytical discussions .",
    "we illustrative our discussion with a plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] . here",
    ", we take a  surviving \" solution point to the @xmath4-@xmath2 fits and perform a further fitting together with the @xmath3 parameter by varying @xmath188 and @xmath178 .",
    "the extremely fine - tuned nature of the solution is well - illustrated by the very narrow @xmath23 bands .",
    "moreover , @xmath188 is always more than twice of @xmath178 for an @xmath190 larger than @xmath191 .",
    "note that @xmath192 of @xmath193 and @xmath194 roughly correspond to an @xmath28 value of @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "the basic features remain if other solution points are taken , hence , we refrain from showing more plots .",
    "the requirement for the 2hdm ii to give rise to the suggested @xmath197 deviation in the muon anomalous magnetic moment demands a light pseudoscalar , preferably around @xmath127 for @xmath198 .",
    "the fcnc constraints , in particular the @xmath1 , require a heavy charged higgs beyond @xmath199 .",
    "this large mass splitting in the higgs mass spectrum is difficult to be accommodated by the precision ew measurements . in particular",
    ", the @xmath3 parameter constraint then admits only very fine - tuned solutions , with cancellation from opposite contributions good to one in a hundred , favoring heavy real scalars .",
    "the fine - tuned nature of the solutions , while making many physicists uncomfortable with the model , is not in itself a good enough reason to pronounce the death of the model .",
    "if one has reasons to be confident about the correctness of the model , one would say that the available constraints are just strong enough to pin down for us the values of the unknown model parameter .",
    "a good example of such a situation is given by the pinning down of the top mass value from precision ew data prior to the experimental discovery of the top quark .",
    "nevertheless , we have not had much of a reason to believe in the correctness of the 2hdm .",
    "in fact , in our analysis here , we focus more on the simultaneous fits to @xmath86 and @xmath2 .",
    "having only the pseudoscalar contribution dominated the corrections to @xmath2 is fatal .",
    "hence , we require a relatively light @xmath106 , while pushing @xmath188 to way beyond @xmath178 in order to satisfy the @xmath3 parameter . even then , not much of a solution to the @xmath4-@xmath2 fits survives the direct search exclusion . here , we require a total @xmath23 of 4 or smaller for the @xmath4-@xmath2 fits to claim a good solution . for roughly @xmath200 , no solution to @xmath4-@xmath2",
    "fits survives the delphi exclusion .",
    "in fact , there is no solution to the @xmath4-@xmath2 fit for a @xmath22 value quite a bit smaller than 40 . for @xmath22 value from around 40 to a bit beyond 50 , solutions surviving",
    "the delphi exclusions exist , but only to be killed by the opal exclusions . for even larger @xmath22 , the @xmath4-@xmath2 solutions surviving both the delphi and opal exclusions started to emerge .",
    "this is very much restricted to an @xmath28 value in the range @xmath126 .",
    "solution regions shrink fast outside the range as the @xmath106 values given by the @xmath4-@xmath2 fits drop towards opal exclusion bound .    in summary , under the strong restriction of the available constraints ,",
    "we show that only a very tiny window of apparent solutions exist close to the limit of @xmath198 .",
    "if the opal group could tailor their analysis of the lep data to focus on the apparent solution window as shown here , we would be able to have a more definite conclusion .",
    "it looks to us that the solution window will be shut down quite substantially .",
    "so , we have  almost enough \" constraints to kill the model altogether . for @xmath22 beyond the @xmath137 limit ,",
    "our hands are tied at the moment by the unavailability of the strong lep exclusion results as presented by opal .",
    "the very large @xmath22 values certainly make many of us uncomfortable though .",
