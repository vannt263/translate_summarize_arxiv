    "for several decades , two - dimensional ( 2d ) localized structures have been a frequent subject of experimental , numerical and analytical studies  @xcite . a particularly interesting class of localized structures , known as localized states ( ls ) , results from the coexistence of two stationary states , either of which can fill the entire spatial domain  @xcite .",
    "these states may take the form of spatially homogeneous equilibria or spatially periodic patterns .",
    "a stable pattern can be created from an equilibrium @xmath0 by the turing instability , which can be either supercritical or subcritical . in the supercritical case ,",
    "since the equilibrium @xmath0 is unstable while the pattern is stable , the latter invades the former via a pulled front and thus no steady ls are expected  @xcite ; ref .",
    "@xcite describes the invasion of a homogeneous state by a hexagonal pattern of this type . in the subcritical case ,",
    "@xmath0 and the pattern can both be stable and the front between them ( known as a pushed front ) may remain pinned to the pattern over a range of parameter values @xcite .",
    "this pinning mechanism underlies much recent work on both 1d and 2d ls , notably in the quadratic - cubic swift - hohenberg equation ( sh23 ) .",
    "the bifurcation structures and temporal dynamics of 1d ls in sh23 are now well understood  @xcite : stationary reflection - symmetric ls are located on a pair of intertwined branches , one of which corresponds to states with maxima in the center and the other to states with minima in the center . as one proceeds along either branch these states grow in length via the repeated nucleation of a pair of wavelengths , one on either side of the ls , in a process reflected in the back - and - forth oscillations of the branches and referred to as standard homoclinic snaking .",
    "the two ls branches are in addition interconnected by an infinite number of cross - links ( known as `` ladders '' ) formed of stationary but asymmetric ls .",
    "these states , together with the associated multipulse states , coexist within a parameter interval referred to as the snaking or pinning region . outside this interval",
    "the ls grow or decay in time via a process referred to as depinning , i.e. , through the nucleation or destruction of cells at the location of the fronts in a time - dependent manner , while leaving the interior cells undisturbed .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "more recently , 2d ls in sh23 have also been investigated . in ref .",
    "@xcite localized @xmath1-dimensional axisymmetric solutions , hereafter referred to as localized target patterns , are studied using numerical continuation .",
    "the time - independent axisymmetric sh23 in @xmath1 dimensions is treated as a spatial dynamical system in the radial coordinate @xmath2 , with @xmath1 treated as an additional continuous parameter . for localized target patterns with a large radius , the radial profile of the front between the target and the equilibrium",
    "@xmath0 resembles a 1d pushed front .",
    "however , in contrast to 1d , near @xmath3 ( known as the core region ) the target typically has a larger amplitude than at large @xmath2 ( known as the far field ) . as a result",
    "new rings can be nucleated both in the core and at the front , implying that the snaking behavior of localized target patterns for @xmath4 will differ from standard homoclinic snaking at @xmath5 . in particular ,",
    "when the radius is sufficiently large , new rings are nucleated exclusively in the core . a different type of localized structure , stationary spatially localized hexagonal patterns , are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using numerical continuation .",
    "the existence of these solutions follows from a spatial conservation law for the time - independent sh23 in 2d that generalizes a conserved spatial hamiltonian present in 1d .",
    "two classes of such states are known , hereafter referred to as planar and fully localized hexagonal patterns .",
    "the former are localized in 1d , forming a hexagon - filled stripe connected to the background state by a pair of planar fronts , while the latter are bounded by a hexagonal front and localized in 2d .",
    "both structures grow via the nucleation of additional cells along the bounding fronts , in a process similar to standard homoclinic snaking .",
    "a novel feature of the planar case is the presence of secondary snaking branches , corresponding to the nucleation of individual cells _ along _ either front , between successive oscillations of the primary snaking branch that reflect the addition of complete rows of cells along the fronts .",
    "this growth mechanism is also observed along the snaking curve of fully localized hexagons . outside the snaking region",
    "time - dependent calculations show that these almost planar solutions evolve by losing or gaining cells one - by - one in a manner that recapitulates their growth along the snaking branch of time - independent solutions .    in the above example one of the two states comprising",
    "the ls is homogeneous in space while the other is a steady , spatially periodic turing pattern . in other pdes",
    "the two competing states may be both homogeneous states or both stationary patterns .",
    "a notable pattern - forming pde exhibiting bistability between homogeneous states is the forced complex ginzburg - landau equation ( fcgle ) with 2:1 resonance .",
    "this is an equation for a complex scalar amplitude @xmath6  @xcite which describes the effect of subharmonic forcing on a hopf bifurcation to a homogeneous oscillation in spatially extended systems  @xcite .",
    "this pde possesses an up - down symmetry @xmath7 and exhibits a parameter regime where the two `` equivalent '' equilibria @xmath8 related by this symmetry are simultaneously stable . in 1d a codimension - zero family of steady ising fronts between @xmath8",
    "is generically present , and may undergo a pitchfork bifurcation into traveling bloch fronts  @xcite ; near this ising - bloch transition the domain walls can exhibit rich spatiotemporal dynamics  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a dynamical theory for the domain wall between @xmath8 in 2d leads to a characterization of different growth regimes and the prediction of the existence of stable `` droplets '' . in this paper",
    "we study instead the 1:1 fcgle @xmath9 which exhibits , under appropriate conditions , bistability between two equilibria @xmath10 and @xmath11 belonging to the upper and lower branches of an s - shaped bifurcation diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hex_elements ] ) . in 1d",
    "this regime generically exhibits a codimension - one family of steady bloch fronts between @xmath12 when both @xmath12 are stable .",
    "steady ls known as type - i ls can be constructed by assembling two such fronts back - to - back .",
    "recent work has focused on new dynamical phenomena that arise when @xmath13 becomes turing - unstable , including the snaking behavior and depinning dynamics of steady localized turing patterns known as type - ii ls  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to standard homoclinic snaking , type - ii ls grow along a single snaking branch by nucleating new cells at the center of the wavetrain in a process termed defect - mediated snaking ( dms )  @xcite . outside the snaking region , type - ii ls depin by creating or destroying cells in the interior of the wavetrain via successive phase slips , as studied quantitatively in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we characterize 2d ls in the @xmath14 plane in the parameter regime where type - i and type - ii ls are found in 1d .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams of the building blocks of these 1d and 2d ls are shown schematically in fig .",

    ", a branch of stripes @xmath17 bifurcates supercritically from @xmath13 at the turing bifurcation @xmath18 , and may become bistable with @xmath19 to form type - ii ls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_elements](a ) ) . in 2d",
    ", the turing bifurcation generates , in addition to @xmath17 , a pair of hexagonal patterns , hereafter referred to as @xmath20 , that differ in whether the hexagons superposed on @xmath13 are composed of bumps or holes @xcite . as a result",
    "the stripe pattern is unstable to hexagonal perturbations even when it bifurcates supercritically .",
    "the @xmath20 bifurcate transcritically and are likewise both unstable . however ,",
    "in general one or the other of the @xmath20 folds back at @xmath21 and acquires stability as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_elements](b ) .",
    "this is the case in the present case as well .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the above notions become clearer in the case of localized hexagonal patterns organized in a stripe - like structure , referred to as _ planar localized hexagonal patterns _ , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_lochex_illus](d ) and discussed next .",
    "planar 2d ls can be found by time - evolving localized stripe patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_planhex_g2.8972_t0 ] ) in 2d , with superposed small - amplitude noise to excite transverse instabilities of the stripes . figure  [ fig : hex_planhex_g2.8972_t80 ] shows snapshots of the initial stages of this 2d time evolution . the fully 2d pattern that emerges consists of hexagons that align themselves along the stripes with possibly multiple defects .",
    "the subsequent dynamics of this hexagonal pattern in the @xmath19 background depend on the value of @xmath16 used in the time evolution .",
    "however , in each case the fronts connecting the structure to @xmath19 remain approximately straight and hence the double - front picture sketched above is no longer complicated by curvature effects .    for smaller @xmath16 ,",
    "the planar localized hexagonal pattern eventually contracts into a planar symmetric pulse , namely a 1d symmetric pulse invariant in the @xmath22 direction . in this process",
    "the hexagonal cells are repeatedly annihilated by viscous shocks traveling along the bounding fronts , similar to the ultra - fast contraction phase of circular localized hexagonal patterns . a snapshot of the resulting state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_planhex_g2.8955_t400 ] at @xmath23 . for larger @xmath16",
    ", the planar localized hexagonal pattern expands into a possibly imperfect hexagonal pattern that fills the 2d domain . in this process",
    "new hexagonal cells are created in the interior by phase slips centered on two lines of defects that result from the slow separation of the bounding fronts , similar to the fast expansion phase of circular localized hexagonal patterns .",
    "a snapshot of the resulting state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_planhex_g2.899_t1500 ] at @xmath24 .    despite the outward ( inward ) motion of the bounding fronts at larger ( smaller ) @xmath16",
    ", we have not found steady planar localized hexagonal patterns at any intermediate @xmath16 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_planhex_g2.8972_t10000 ] , at @xmath25 the boundary shocks and interior defects compete with each other , leading to non - unidirectional front motion . as a result the final state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_planhex_g2.8972_t30000 ] ) is considerably displaced from the initial centerline ( @xmath26 ) owing to the stochastic creation and annihilation of hexagonal cells .",
    "more remarkably , this final state provides an example of a quasi - steady localized state with a complicated inner structure , which is quite unexpected in spatially homogeneous pattern forming pdes .",
    "the inner structure consists of a few rows of hexagonal cells interspersed with defects arranged in a frustrated configuration that overall neither contracts nor expands , although the competition between these two tendencies manifests itself occasionally as local pulsations .",
    "a remarkable video ( see link:\\hexplanhexc[this url ] ) shows the evolution of this state .",
    "the earlier parts of the video show clearly the propagation of phase slips , whereby a phase slip triggers an adjacent phase slip etc .",
    "the later parts of this very long simulation show persistent dynamics in an apparently equilibrium state , i.e. , a state of a more - or - less fixed width .",
    "this residual time dependence may be associated with the fact that the @xmath27 state is invading the unstable stripe state @xmath17 from the inside while the stable background state @xmath19 invades from the outside , just as in the case of the almost steady circular localized hexagonal patterns .",
    "the resulting fronts are approximately stationary but select wavelengths dynamically ; these wavelengths may lie outside the stability balloon of the hexagonal state leading to phase slips and may , moreover , be incommensurate with the width of the structure , thereby providing an additional source of disequilibrium .",
    "analogous planar localized hexagonal patterns in the subcritical case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_subhex](b ) .    the difference between the dynamics of circular and planar localized hexagonal patterns may be attributed to the effective boundary conditions experienced by the hexagons . in the circular case ,",
    "the bounding front is a single closed curve that acts as a free boundary for the hexagons . as a result ,",
    "the wavelength of the hexagons can change freely in response to front motion .",
    "however , in the planar case , the two bounding fronts are localized in @xmath28 and periodic in @xmath22 , and thus act as free boundaries for the hexagons only in the @xmath28-direction .",
    "thus the @xmath28-wavelength of the hexagons can change freely in response to front motion , but the @xmath22-wavelength is fixed by the periodic boundary conditions in @xmath22 .",
    "this anisotropy of the hexagonal pattern may help explain the coexistence of contraction associated with the fronts and expansion from the interior of the structure .",
    "in this paper we have characterized 2d ls in the 1:1 fcgle with different inner patterns and front shapes .",
    "the parameters are chosen near a codimension - two point between a steady front between two spatially homogeneous equilibria and a supercritical turing bifurcation on one of them .",
    "steady circular fronts in the turing - stable regime and localized target patterns in the turing - unstable regime respectively exhibit new bifurcation structures termed radially collapsed snaking ( rcs ) and core - mediated snaking ( cms ) .",
    "axisymmetric oscillons on the rcs and cms branches are found to be spectrally stable over a wide parameter interval , and subject to various types of radial and azimuthal instabilities otherwise .",
    "new temporal dynamics involving front contraction or expansion are found using radial and fully 2d time evolution , the latter leading to fully 2d ls including supercritical circular and planar localized hexagonal patterns .",
    "the stable axisymmetric oscillons in the 1:1 fcgle may be compared with the 2:1 fcgle  @xcite . in the 2:1 case ,",
    "stable 2d oscillons exist on a much narrower parameter interval than stable 1d oscillons .",
    "in contrast , in the 1:1 case , stable 2d oscillons exist on multiple segments of the rcs and cms branches , and the width of the existence interval is comparable to stable 1d oscillons . the existence of multiple folds on these branches results from the existence of a supercritical turing bifurcation near a stable front , which is not known to occur in the 2:1 case",
    ". however , stable 2d oscillons may be similarly present in other harmonically forced systems relevant to experiments .    the subcritical localized hexagonal patterns in the 1:1 fcgle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hex_subhex ] ) may be compared with sh23  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the bifurcation diagrams of steady solutions may be computable using numerical continuation following ref .  @xcite . in the supercritical case new types of temporal dynamics include the slow expansion ( contraction ) of the hexagonal pattern driven by phase slips , and the non - unidirectional front motion of planar localized hexagonal patterns near the equivalent of a maxwell point .",
    "it is possible that in large domains the occurrence of phase slips may be treated as a stochastic process , with a corresponding stochastic description of the front motion . in particular",
    ", it may be that on particular timescales , the front motion near the maxwell point can be viewed as a random walk .",
    "these features may be further understood by locating the penta - hepta defects through computing the coordination numbers of the individual hexagons , and studying their lifetimes .",
    "these ideas are left for future work .",
    "we remark , finally , that the present system also exhibits parameter regimes where the homogeneous equilibria @xmath12 and the hexagonal pattern @xmath27 are all simultaneously stable . in particular , the `` maxwell '' point between @xmath12 may lie inside the pinning region between @xmath27 and @xmath13 . near this tristable situation , the front speed competition may produce additional interesting dynamics .",
