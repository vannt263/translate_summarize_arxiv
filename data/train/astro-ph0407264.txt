    "the galactic nucleus ( gn ) is among the most interesting objects in the high - energy sky , as it links our own galaxy with active galactic nuclei and quasars . at a distance of 8  kpc ( eisenauher et al .",
    "2003 ) , it hosts the closest massive black hole ( bh ) to us , as shown in particular by near - infrared ( nir ) observations of star proper motions near the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "the detailed nir observations of the central cluster of young and luminous stars have now constrained the enclosed mass within 0.001 pc ( @xmath3  120  au ) to a value which implies a core density @xmath4  10@xmath5  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 .",
    "this density is most naturally explained by the presence of a massive black hole of @xmath8  10@xmath9  m@xmath6 .",
    "such a bh would have a  schwarzschild radius ( @xmath10 ) of about 1.2  10@xmath11 cm or 0.08 au and is supposed to accrete the environmental matter producing detectable emission in a broad frequency range @xcite .",
    "+ the bright ( @xmath12  jy ) , compact , non - thermal radio source sgr  a@xmath13 , discovered exactly 30 years ago by balick and brown ( 1974 ) and located at less than 0.01@xmath14 ( 83 au ) from the dynamical center of the central star cluster is believed to be the radio conterpart of this extreme object .",
    "its radio spectrum is described by an inverted or flat power law with high and low frequency cut - offs , and a peculiar sub - mm bump at frequencies @xmath4  100  ghz . only recently detected in nir both in quiescent , and flaring states @xcite , this source is undetectable in the visible and uv bands due to the large absorption and is also very weak in x - rays .",
    "the chandra observatory measured in 1999 a quiescent luminosity of only @xmath15}\\approx2\\times10^{33}$ ]  erg  s@xmath2 from  and the emission appeared partly extended .",
    "however , in october 2000 , chandra detected a bright 3  hr flare , characterized by rapid intrinsic variability @xcite . during this flare",
    "the luminosity increased to @xmath16}\\approx10^{35}$ ]  erg  s@xmath2 in 4  ks , the power law spectrum hardened , with a change of the photon index from 2.7 in quiescence to 1.3 , and a rapid decrease on a timescale of 600  s was observed , thus implying an emitting region of size @xmath17  20  @xmath10 .",
    "two other bright x - ray flares from sgr  a@xmath13 were detected with xmm - newton on september 4 , 2001 and on october 3 , 2002 @xcite . in 2001",
    "xmm - newton detected the beginning of a flare in the last 900 s of an observation pointed towards the gn ( goldwurm et al .",
    "2003a ) . in this interval the  flux increased by up to a factor 30 and the spectrum hardened to a slope of index 1 . in october 2002",
    "the most powerful flare from this source was discovered with xmm - newton .",
    "it lasted only 2.7 ks but the source luminosity reached @xmath18  3.6  @xmath19  10@xmath20  erg  s@xmath2 with an increase factor of nearly 200 in luminosity and a rather soft spectrum ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "+ these last observations have opened challenging new questions regarding the accretion process , activity and emission mechanisms at work in sgr a * and have also re - opened the possibility of observing the source in the hard x - ray and gamma - ray bands ( @xmath4 10 - 30 kev ) . at energies between 10 and 20 kev a number of detections of sgr  a@xmath13",
    "were claimed in the past , the most significant were those based on spacelab 2 observations in 1985 @xcite and those of art - p on granat in 1990 - 1991 @xcite .",
    "skinner et al . (",
    "1987 ) reported the detection with the xrt / sl2 of a source compatible with  and noted that it was much brighter than the extrapolation of the soft x - ray emission seen with the einstein observatory .",
    "the art - p data also showed presence of emission in the 8 - 20 kev band at even higher flux levels , impling that the source 4 - 20 kev luminosity ranged between 5 and 10 @xmath22  erg  s@xmath2 ( see goldwurm 2001 for a review ) .",

    "the coded mask gamma - ray telescope sigma on the granat satellite performed a deep @xmath24  s survey of the central parts of the galaxy between 1990 and 1997 , but could provide only upper limits for the hard x- and @xmath25-ray emission from the neighbourhood of at energies above 35  kev @xcite .",
    "+ the derived low bolometric luminosity of the gn , in contrast with the powerful output from active galactic nuclei or black hole binaries , has motivated the development of several models for radiatively inefficient accretion onto or ejection from the central supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "these models have been then widely applied to other accreting systems but their validity for  have been challenged by more and more precise measurements over the last 10 years @xcite . the observed x - ray flares and",
    "the very recent discovery with the vlt naco imager @xcite and the keck telescope @xcite , that is also the source of frequent ir flares could indicate the presence of an important population of non - thermal electrons in the vicinity of the black hole @xcite .",

    "<S> we report on the discovery of a source , igr j17456 - 2901 , compatible with the instrument s point spread function and coincident with the galactic nucleus to within 0.9@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the source is visible up to 60 - 80  kev with a 20100  kev luminosity at 8  kpc of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not unequivocally associate the new integral source to the galactic nucleus , this is the first report of significant hard x  </S>",
    "<S> ray emission from within the inner 10@xmath0 of the galaxy and a contribution from the galactic center supermassive black hole itself can not be excluded . here </S>",
