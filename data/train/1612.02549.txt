    "a constructive proof provides an algorithm for constructing the claimed object ; a non - constructive proof does not show the existence of that object algorithmically , while sometimes an effective procedure might be hidden inside the details . a proof",
    "then _ is proved to be ( essentially ) non - constructive _ when one can show that there is no algorithm ( computable function ) which , given the assumptions ( coded as input ) , produces the claimed object whose existence is demonstrated in the proof .",
    "below , we will see one example of a ( seemingly ) non - constructive proof ( namely , the proof of kleene  @xcite for gdel s first incompleteness theorem ) which can be constructive ( effectivized ) by unpacking some details ; we will also see a couple of proofs ( namely , the proofs of boolos  @xcite and chaitin  @xcite for gdel s first incompleteness theorem ) that are shown to be non - constructive , by proving the non - existence of any algorithm for computing the claimed object ( namely , the true but unprovable sentence ) .",
    "gdel s original proof  @xcite for his incompleteness theorem is constructive , i.e. , given a ( finite ) description of a consistent re theory ( e.g.  an input - free program which outputs the set of all the axioms of the theory ) the proof exhibits , in an algorithmic way , a sentence which is true ( in the standard model of natural numbers @xmath0 ) but unprovable in the theory . for the independence of this sentence from the theory ( i.e. , the unprovability of its negation in the theory ) gdel also assumes the theory to be @xmath1-consistent",
    "; so if the theory is @xmath1-consistent , then that ( true ) sentence is independent from the theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it turned out later that the simple consistency of the theory does not suffice for the independence of the gdel sentence ( from the theory ) and the optimal condition ( which is much weaker than @xmath1-consistency ) is _ the consistency of the theory with its own consistency statement _ ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems  35,36 ) ) .",
    "rosser s proof @xcite for gdel s first incompleteness theorem assumes only the simple consistency of the ( re ) theory and constructs ( algorithmically ) an independent ( and true ) sentence .",
    "so , one can say that gdel s proof is not rosserizable . here",
    ", we will see that while the proof of chaitin is rosserizable ( i.e. , the independence of chaitin s sentence from the theory can be proved by assuming only the simple consistency of the theory ) , the proof of boolos is not ( and the optimal condition for the independence of boolos sentence is the consistency of the theory with its own consistency statement ) .",
    "a very cute proof for gdel s incompleteness theorem is that of kleene ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which deserves more recognition .",
    "let @xmath2 be a list of all unary computable ( partial recursive ) functions .",
    "a recursively enumerable set ( re for short ) is the domain of @xmath3 , for some @xmath4 , which is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the notation @xmath6 symbolizes the fact that the function @xmath3 is not defined at @xmath7 , or @xmath8 ; thus @xmath9 means that @xmath3 is defined at @xmath7 or @xmath10 , and @xmath11 means that @xmath3 is defined at @xmath7 and equals to @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14        let @xmath20 ; then we have @xmath21 since if @xmath22 but @xmath23 then the true @xmath24-sentence @xmath25 is provable in ( the @xmath24-complete theory ) @xmath15 ( @xmath26 ) contradicting the consistency of @xmath16 . now ,",
    "since @xmath16 is re then so is @xmath27 , while @xmath28 is not an re set because for any @xmath29 we have @xmath30 and so @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 for all @xmath29 .",
    "so , @xmath33 ; therefore , there must exist some @xmath34 . for this @xmath35",
    "we have @xmath18 but @xmath19 .    of course if @xmath16 is sound ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) or even @xmath24-sound ( i.e. , @xmath37 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) then also @xmath38 , i.e. , the sentence @xmath39 is ( true and ) independent from @xmath16 .",
    "let us note that the above proof did not explicitly specify @xmath17 .",
    "let us note that for the constructivity of a proof , usually , no new argument is needed as a computational procedure could often be seen from the proof .",
    "but the non - cosntructivity of a proof ( as in the case of chaitin s and boolos proofs ) should be proved ; proving the non - constructivity ( the non - existence of any algorithm ) is usually harder than showing the constructivity ( the existence of an algorithm ) .",
    "so is the rosserizability of a proof .",
    "other than rosser s proof and kleene s symmetric theorem ( 1950 ) chaitin s proof is also rosserizable .",
    "the non - rosserizable proofs of gdel and boolos need the consistency of @xmath43 for the independence of their true but unprovable sentences , and this condition , @xmath44 , is optimal ( for the independence of that sentences ) .",
    "the authors know no similar optimal condition(s ) for the independence of kleene s sentence in his first ( 1936 ) proof .              , , 38 ( 1931 )  173198 .",
