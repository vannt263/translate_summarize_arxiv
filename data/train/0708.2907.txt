    "in @xmath0 supergravity ( sugra ) models the scalar potential is specified in terms of the k@xmath1hler function @xmath2 which is a combination of two functions : k@xmath1hler potential @xmath3 and superpotential @xmath4 .",
    "here we use standard supergravity mass units : @xmath5 . in order to break supersymmetry in @xmath0 sugra models ,",
    "a hidden sector is introduced .",
    "it is assumed that the superfields of the hidden sector @xmath6 interact with the observable ones only by means of gravity . at the minimum of the scalar potential ,",
    "hidden sector fields acquire vacuum expectation values breaking local susy and generating a non  zero gravitino mass @xmath7 .",
    "in   general   the   vacuum   energy   density   in   sugra   models   is   huge   and   negative   @xmath8 .",
    "the situation changes dramatically in no - scale supergravity where the invariance of the lagrangian under imaginary translations and dilatations results in the vanishing of the vacuum energy density .",
    "unfortunately these global symmetries also protect supersymmetry which has to be broken in any phenomenologically acceptable theory .",
    "it was argued that the breakdown of dilatation invariance does not necessarily result in a non ",
    "zero vacuum energy density @xcite@xcite .",
    "this happens if the dilatation invariance is broken in the superpotential of the hidden sector only .",
    "the hidden sector of the simplest sugra model of this type involves two singlet superfields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that transform differently under dilatations @xmath11 the invariance under the global symmetry transformations ( [ 3 ] ) constrains the k@xmath1hler potential and superpotential of the hidden sector . in the considered sugra model",
    "they can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath12\\,,\\qquad   \\hat{w}(z)=\\kappa\\biggl(z^3+\\mu_0 z^2+\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty}c_n z^n \\biggr)\\ , .",

    "however the sugra scalar potential of the hidden sector remains positive definite in the considered model @xmath15 so that the vacuum energy density vanishes near its global minima . in the simplest case",
    "when @xmath16 , the scalar potential ( [ 6 ] ) has two extremum points at @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the first vacuum where @xmath18 , local supersymmetry is broken and the gravitino gains a non  zero mass . in the second minimum , the vacuum expectation value of the superfield @xmath10 and the gravitino mass vanish",

    "( [ 5 ] ) , the scalar potential of the hidden sector may have many degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken supersymmetry in which the vacuum energy density vanishes",
    ".    thus the considered breakdown of dilatation invariance leads to a natural realisation of the multiple point principle ( mpp ) assumption .",
    "the mpp postulates the existence of the maximal number of phases with the same energy density which are allowed by a given theory @xcite .",
    "successful application of the mpp to @xmath0 supergravity requires us to assume the existence of a vacuum in which the low  energy limit of the considered theory is described by a pure supersymmetric model in flat minkowski space @xcite . according to the mpp this vacuum and",
    "the physical one in which we live must be degenerate .",
    "such a second vacuum is realised only if the sugra scalar potential has a minimum where @xmath19 which normally requires an extra fine - tuning @xcite . in the sugra model considered above the mpp conditions",
    "are fulfilled automatically without any extra fine - tuning .",
    "since the vacuum energy density of supersymmetric states in flat minkowski space is just zero and all vacua in the mpp inspired sugra models are degenerate , the cosmological constant problem is solved to first approximation by assumption in these models .",
    "however the value of the cosmological constant may differ from zero in the considered models .",
    "this occurs if non  perturbative effects in the observable sector give rise to the breakdown of supersymmetry in the second vacuum ( phase ) .",
    "the mpp philosophy then requires that the physical phase in which local supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector has the same energy density as a second phase where non  perturbative supersymmetry breakdown takes place in the observable sector .",
    "if supersymmetry breaking takes place in the second vacuum , it is caused by the strong interactions .",
    "when the gauge couplings at high energies are identical in both vacua and @xmath20 is the susy breaking scale in the physical vacuum the scale @xmath21 , where the qcd interactions become strong in the second vacuum , is given by @xmath22\\,,\\qquad \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{(2)}_3(m_s)}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{(1)}_3(m_z)}- \\frac{\\tilde{b}_3}{4\\pi}\\ln\\frac{m^2_{s}}{m_z^2}\\ , .",

    "when the supersymmetry breaking scale in our vacuum is of the order of 1 tev , we obtain @xmath34 ev @xcite .",
    "this results in an enormous suppression of the total vacuum energy density ( @xmath35 ) compared to say an electroweak scale contribution in our vacuum @xmath36 . from the rough estimate of the energy density",
    "it can be easily seen that the measured value of the cosmological constant is reproduced when @xmath37 ev .",
    "the appropriate values of @xmath21 can therefore only be obtained for @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however if the mssm particle content is supplemented by an additional pair of @xmath30 multiplets the observed value of the cosmological constant can be reproduced even for @xmath39 ( see fig .  1 ) . in the physical vacuum",
    "these extra particles would gain masses around the supersymmetry breaking scale due to the presence of the bilinear term @xmath40 $ ] in @xmath3 .",
    "near the second minimum of the sugra scalar potential the new particles would be massless , since @xmath19 , and would reduce @xmath21 via their contribution to the @xmath41 functions .",
    "we have shown that the breakdown of global symmetries in no - scale supergravity can lead to a set of degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken local supersymmetry ( first and second phases ) so that the mpp conditions are satisfied without any extra fine - tuning . in the mpp",
    "inspired sugra models supersymmetry in the second phase may be broken dynamically in the observable sector inducing a very small positive energy density which can be assigned , by virtue of the mpp , to all other phases .",
