    "the phenomenon of self - organized criticality ( soc ) attracts a lot of interest in various branches of science ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "its most intriguing feature resides in the `` spontaneous '' formation of scale - free spatio - temporal patterns with power - law correlations between various quantities . on the one hand",
    ", these correlations closely resemble those that appear at critical points in continuous phase transitions . on the other hand , while the critical state in phase transitions is temperature- or external - field - driven , a soc state is thought to form without fine - tuning of any external parameters .",
    "the relation between the `` classical '' and `` self - organized '' criticality has been studied by many authors @xcite with a conclusion that the origin of the self - organized criticality is a continuous absorbing - state phase transition to which a soc system is attracted .",
    "perhaps the best - known and most extensively studied model of thermodynamic criticality is the ising model of ferromagnetism . of similar importance for self - organized criticality",
    "is the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) model @xcite of a sandpile . owing to its elegant mathematical structure and many rigorous results @xcite",
    ", the btw model has practically become a paradigm for self - organized criticality studies .",
    "specific soc features of the btw model , which will attract our attention , include the fact that in the btw model correlation functions decay with the distance @xmath2 as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the space dimensionality @xcite , which resembles , but differs from the @xmath5 decay in standard critical phenomena .",
    "as the behavior of a correlation function is a key ingredient of criticality , we will use this property to build and analyze a model which , by construction , is expected to exhibit long - range correlations induced by both classical and self - organized critical phenomena . in defining such a model",
    "we follow the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite : take a standard model of statistical physics and significantly reduce its phase space to that of a corresponding soc model .",
    "one of the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a combination of the potts and btw models was investigated , is that in the limit of a vanishingly small temperature their hybrid system looses its ` self - organized criticality ' , i.e.  the power - law correlations disappear .",
    "thus it seems worthwile to investigate a hybrid model , numerically , for a wide range of temperatures . in particular , we want to check if the self - organized criticality imposed by nonlocal constraints can be detected in the behavior of thermodynamic functions . however , as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , because of the non - local nature of the applied constraints , analysis of this type of models is a difficult problem , still at its infancy , so it is of interest to check whether standard concepts and theorems of statistical physics , like existence of the thermodynamic limit , ergodicity , fluctuation - dissipation theorem or the central limit theorem apply to such hybrid systems .    in our study",
    "we choose the two - dimensional spin-1 ising model as the hamiltonian system and the btw sandpile model as the soc component .",
    "the resulting model is an equilibrium model that takes ( short - range ) interactions from the ising model and the ( non - local ) constraints from the btw model .",
    "note , however , that while the ising model focuses on spin configuration at thermodynamical equilibrium , the btw model attempts to describe a nonequilibrium , dynamical process where grains of sand are continually added to the lattice to form `` avalanches '' of different sizes and durations .",
    "the construction of such a `` hybrid '' model employs the fact that both component models are built on a lattice with special variables ( `` spins '' @xmath6 or `` grain heights '' @xmath7 ) attached to each lattice node , and the values of these variables are limited to a few integers , e.g.  @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "this property allows us to map the states of one model onto the states of the other one . to reduce to the minimum the number of possible mappings of the spins @xmath6 of the ising model to the sand heights @xmath7 of the btw sandpile",
    ", we choose a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice ( coordination number @xmath10 ) .    in a hybrid system like this",
    "the high - temperature limit is determined entirely by the constraints of the soc component ; consequently , the spin correlation function should decay with the distance @xmath2 as @xmath11 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state is expected to be controlled mainly by the hamiltonian , and at sufficiently low temperatures interactions should force the system into an ordered phase .",
    "consequently , one can expect a thermodynamic phase transition at some finite temperature @xmath0 .",
    "for the standard 2d ising model without an external field this transition is continuous and the spatial correlations decay as @xmath12 with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if introduction of the soc constraints turns out to be too weak to change the nature of this transition , the hybrid model should exhibit a power - law decay of correlation functions both for @xmath14 and at @xmath0 .    although the ising model has been modified in many , many ways , most of the modifications are of local character .",
    "these include building the model on fractal @xcite or small - world @xcite lattices as well as introduction of quenched @xcite or kinetic @xcite disorder . in our present approach",
    "the modification is nonlocal ",
    "one has to scan the whole lattice to decide whether a given configuration is allowed or not .",
    "this introduces several complications , but at the same time opens new directions of research . in our analysis",
    "we shall consider both the effects of introducing interactions and temperature to a soc model and the changes introduced by a soc - like constraints into a hamiltonian system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we define the model .",
    "then , in section [ sec : numerics ] we discuss problems that appear in monte carlo simulations and we present some methods that we have applied to overcome them . the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "they include a numerical analysis of the finite - size effects imposed by the soc subsystem , an analytical study of the influence of the sandpile model on the number of phases in the hamiltonian subsystem , and a numerical analysis of the impact of the soc and hamiltonian components on the critical properties of the system",
    ". it also contains results of several tests carried out to verify if the hybrid model with nonlocal constraints can be treated with standard methods of statistical physics .",
    "these include tests of whether fluctuations of the internal energy can be used to determine the specific heat and whether far from the critical point the central limit theorem can be applied to predict the distribution of the energy fluctuations .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we define the model on a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of linear size @xmath15 .",
    "an example of such a lattice with @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the lattice has a shape of a big hexagon made of @xmath17 small hexagons and it has @xmath18 nodes .",
    "most of them are interior nodes connected to 3 nearest neighbors , but @xmath19 nodes lie on the edge of the lattice and have only 2 connections .    .",
    "empty , shadowed , and filled circles represent the nodes with heights @xmath20 ( or spins @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "the arrows show an example of a pair of boundary nodes that interact via the ising hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    each node @xmath22 can be in one of three states , which can be interpreted either as a spin variable @xmath23 or the number of sand grains @xmath9 . of 6 mappings of heights @xmath7 on spins",
    "@xmath6 , we choose the one in which @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath25 , respectively ( actually , due to the @xmath26 symmetry , the number of non - equivalent mappings reduces to 3 ) .    the hamiltonian of the model is simply that of the spin-1 ising model , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a real parameter , @xmath29 , and the sum is to be taken over all pairs of nearest neighbors . to minimize finite - size effects ,",
    "we have adopted periodic boundary conditions . to this end",
    "we assume that , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , each boundary node interacts , via ( [ eq : ham ] ) , not only with its two direct lattice neighbors , but also with the node at the location symmetric about the lattice center .",
    "this choice ensures that the ground state in the antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath30 ) is doubly degenerated and , together with the several consecutive excited states , obey the @xmath26 symmetry .    in the standard spin-1 ising model",
    "the phase space is defined by all possible spin configurations . to each such configuration @xmath31",
    "one can assign a non - vanishing temperature - dependent probability @xmath32 $ ] , and their number is exactly @xmath33 .",
    "however , the states of the btw model , which is a dynamic , nonequilibrium model of a sand pile in a continual flux of sand grains , have completely different properties .",
    "it turns out that all configurations can be divided into two categories : disallowed and allowed .",
    "the former can never be found in the steady state , while the latter can be found with the same probability @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the number of allowed configurations is @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xcite ; hence the number of allowed configurations is only a fraction of all configurations and this fraction tends to 0 as @xmath36 .    the main idea behind building a hybrid hamiltonian - soc model is to take a standard model of equilibrium statistical physics , e.g.  the spin-1 ising model , and significantly reduce its phase space to that of a corresponding soc model , e.g.  the btw model . solving a hybrid model is then equivalent to finding the partition function @xmath37,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all states @xmath31 of the hamiltonian component , @xmath38 is the characteristic function of a soc state , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the boltzmann constant . to complete the definition of the model",
    ", it remains to explain how to distinguish an allowed configuration from a disallowed one in the btw model .",
    "a complete discussion of this problem is given by dhar in @xcite ; here we will give only a brief summary of his results : ( i ) a configuration with all @xmath41 is allowed .",
    "( ii ) if we take an allowed configuration @xmath42 and increase the value of @xmath7 at some @xmath22 by one , this @xmath7 may exceed the maximum value @xmath43 ; however , if we then relax such an `` unstable '' state ( in the way defined below ) , we will always arrive at an allowed configuration .",
    "( iii ) all allowed configurations can be reached by iteratively applying step ( ii ) to any allowed configuration .",
    "relaxation of unstable states is carried out as follows : for any site @xmath22 at which @xmath44 , replace @xmath7 with @xmath45 and for every neighbor @xmath46 of @xmath22 increase @xmath47 by 1 . relaxation of any state can be carried out in arbitrary order , consists of a finite number of steps that form the so called avalanches and the resulting stable state is unique @xcite .",
    "an example of an allowed configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "note that while we use periodic boundary conditions for the hamiltonian part of the model , we employ open bc for the relaxation process so that excessive `` sand grains '' can leave the system .",
    "most sandpile models studied so far are characterized by irreversible dynamics , where one only _ adds _ grains which later leave the system through open boundaries .",
    "thus , if by adding a grain to a stable state @xmath48 and relaxing it one arrives at another stable state @xmath49 , there is usually no way to return from @xmath49 to @xmath48 in just one step . as this violates the detailed - balance condition and hence drives the system out of equilibrium , in our simulations we also use the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to construct the reversed process that transforms @xmath49 back to @xmath48 .",
    "this method is based on removing a grain from an ( arbitrary ) node and then fully relaxing the resulting state .    following the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite , in each time step",
    "we construct a trial state by picking at random a lattice node @xmath22 and adding or removing a grain at it .",
    "if this renders the configuration unstable , an avalanche is generated and the system is fully relaxed to a stable state .",
    "we then calculate the energy of the trial state , @xmath50 , compare it with the energy of the original state , @xmath51 , and accept the trial state with probability @xmath52)$ ] .",
    "this , however , may lead to problems with ergodicity .",
    "since the phase space of our model is limited to recurrent states of a markov process defined by the btw model , there is no doubt that at least in theory the system is ergodic .",
    "however , some transition probabilities can be extremely small",
    ". this problem can be particularly serious for transitions related to large avalanches , as in their case the factor @xmath53 $ ] can quickly tend to 0 as @xmath36",
    ".    calculation of a trial state in our model is extremely time - consuming , for it requires to perform full relaxation of an excited state , and the average number of individual topplings in an avalanche is proportional to the number of lattice nodes @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "for this reason we were able to perform simulations only for rather small lattices with @xmath55 ( for a pure ising or btw models this number could be easily increased by a factor 1000 ) . due to the non - local nature of sandpile dynamics employed to generate trial states",
    ", there seems to be no way to apply here any of the many techniques for speeding up monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the only ` trick ' we used was to store , for a given configuration , energies of any rejected monte - carlo trial steps to avoid multiple relaxations of the same state . for low temperatures this can speed up calculations by a factor of 100 .",
    "two essentially different types of finite size effects can be expected to appear in the model . the first kind , typical of critical points , results from the fact that at criticality the diverging correlation lengths exceed the system size .",
    "the second kind is inherent to soc models with open boundaries , as the mean concentration of particles near the open boundaries tends to be smaller than that in the bulk .",
    "for a two - dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath15 this phenomenon brings about a finite - size correction of order @xmath56 @xcite . this finite - size effect",
    "has a noticeable impact on the thermodynamics of the hybrid model _",
    "at all temperatures_. its magnitude can be appreciated by studying the limit of the temperature going to infinity , since in this case our model is governed entirely by its soc component .     as a function of @xmath57 for lattice sizes @xmath58 .",
    "the error bars are less than the line width .",
    "the dashed line represents a quadratic fit and the extrapolated value for @xmath36 is @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ]    although the finite - size effects in the btw model were investigated in several papers @xcite , none of them referred to the honeycomb lattice .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] depicts @xmath60 , i.e.  the order parameter in the standard ising model ( magnetization per node ) , for several values of the system size @xmath15 .",
    "as expected , the dependence of this parameter on @xmath15 is quite strong . upon approximating @xmath61 as a quadratic in @xmath62 and extrapolating it to the limit of @xmath36",
    ", we obtained @xmath63 , which suggests that @xmath64 .",
    "note that in our model @xmath65 even at infinite temperature and in absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this reflects a property of the btw sandpile model that nodes with 2 grains ( corresponding to @xmath41 , or @xmath66 ) are more probable than those with 1 grain ( @xmath67 , or @xmath68 ) .",
    "similarly good quadratic fits were found for the mean concentrations @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 of nodes with @xmath72 , 1 and 2 , respectively . in the limit of @xmath36 we obtained @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "note that the exact values of @xmath79 are known for square @xcite and bethe @xcite lattices , and numerical results are available for hypercubic lattices of dimension 2 to 5 @xcite .",
    "as we have just seen , the high - temperature properties of our model are very unusual : while in standard hamiltonian systems at high temperatures the magnetization disappears ( the system is in a disordered , paramagnetic phase ) , our hybrid system exhibits a nonzero , positive @xmath80 as @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we will show that @xmath81 in the limit @xmath36 ( of an infinite system ) , at any temperature and for any values of the control parameter @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the total number of lattice nodes with @xmath46 grains , @xmath83 .",
    "on the one hand their sum is the total number of lattice nodes , @xmath84 on the other hand , in any allowed configuration these numbers satisfy @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of bonds on a lattice of size @xmath15 .",
    "this relation can be justified using the original version of the burning algorithm @xcite , which guarantees that the @xmath86 bonds can be mapped onto the @xmath54 nodes in such a way that a node with @xmath46 grains is an image of at least @xmath46 bonds .",
    "equation ( [ eq : n0+n1+n2=n ] ) implies @xmath87 and , since in our case @xmath88 , equation ( [ eq:2n2+n1=b ] ) leads to @xmath89 . hence @xmath90",
    "as the right - hand - side of this relation tends to 0 as @xmath36 , we conclude that there can be no phase with a negative value of @xmath80 .",
    "this is not a trivial statement , as for suitably chosen values of @xmath28 and @xmath91 , @xmath80 can take on any value in the range @xmath92 $ ] , and for finite lattices there even exist allowed configurations with @xmath93 .",
    "an example of a system with @xmath93 is a lattice with @xmath94 in which one node has a hight @xmath41 ( corresponding to the spin @xmath95 ) and the remaining 5 nodes have @xmath67 ( i.e.  @xmath96 ) . since ( [ eq : n2>n1 ] ) applies to systems at an arbitrary temperature , it implies that no paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition at finite @xmath91 is possible in the hybrid model , so that the parameter @xmath80 can not be regarded as a usual magnetization .",
    "similar arguments lead to @xmath97 , which implies that no quadrupolar phase is possible in the model ( in a quadrupolar phase half of the nodes have spins @xmath98 , i.e.  @xmath99 ) .",
    "consequently , only two phases can exist : a high - t paramagnetic ( @xmath100 ) and a low - t antiferromagnetic ( @xmath101 ) phase .",
    "note that this reduction of the number of possible phases is a consequence of the constraints imposed on the ising model by the sandpile dynamics , and has nothing to do with the `` criticality '' of the latter .",
    "these conclusions are in accord with symmetry considerations .",
    "because of the constraints imposed by the underlying soc model , the hybrid model has a single , unique `` ferromagnetic '' ground state , and hence the low-@xmath91 system with ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath102 ) is not invariant under the @xmath26 symmetry of the standard ising model ; consequently , no ferromagnetic - like phase transition is expected in the system . on the other hand , the soc constraints do not affect the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath103 ) ground state nor none of its `` neighboring '' ( i.e. slightly excited ) states . thus , the hybrid model with antiferromagnetic coupling at low @xmath91 obeys the antiferromagnetic @xmath26 symmetry , which opens a possibility of the antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "since we expect the antiferromagnetic phase to appear only for @xmath30 , we decided to look for a temperature - driven transition between the @xmath100 and @xmath101 phases only for @xmath30 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we measure energy in units of @xmath104 and set the boltzmann constant @xmath105 . to investigate a phase transition",
    ", we formally divide the lattice into two sublattices ( such that no adjacent nodes belong to the same sublattice ) and we define a parameter @xmath106 as half of the difference between magnetizations on each sublattice . in the ground state",
    "our system has a perfect antiferromagnetic order , with one sublattice completely filled with spins @xmath107 , and the other one with @xmath108 .",
    "hence the mean energy per node @xmath109 , magnetization @xmath110 and the order parameter @xmath111 .",
    "we expect that @xmath112 in the @xmath101 phase , and @xmath113 in the high-@xmath91 phase .",
    "we start each simulation from the ground state in phase @xmath114 with @xmath115 , and then slowly warm the system up .",
    "after equilibrating , at each temperature we use an algorithm of @xcite to generate @xmath116 configurations .",

    "the system can switch to @xmath169 , but the histogram is very asymmetric , which indicates that the actual relaxation time must be _ much _ larger than the simulation time . as illustrated in the third panel , at a little higher temperature @xmath122 the system can already freely switch between @xmath170 and @xmath169 for all investigated system sizes .",
    "however , the histogram for @xmath119 turns out asymmetric about @xmath113 and very erratic , which again indicates that the relaxation time is far larger than that available in computer simulations .",
    "finally , the last panel shows that at a high temperature , @xmath171 , histograms are again smooth functions of @xmath106 , and each can be approximated by a normal distribution .",
    "therefore , for temperatures @xmath133 and large system sizes @xmath15 , the actual relaxation time is much larger than the simulation time .",
    "large relative errors of the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : binder ] can thus be explained by the phenomenon of slow relaxation , which seems to be a generic property of sandpile models @xcite , and which should be particularly important at temperatures close to @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and three lattice sizes @xmath123 ( dotted line ) , 20 ( dashed line ) and 40 ( solid line , narrowest distribution ) . [ fig:4panels ] ]      recall that a signature of criticality is the power - law decay for the probability @xmath176 that two nodes at a distance @xmath2 apart have heights @xmath46 and @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "it was proved @xcite that in the bulk of a two - dimensional sandpile one has @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are some constants that depend on the lattice and boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this relation can be used as a test of the extent to which the self - organized criticality is affected by temperature and interactions .",
    "the idea is simple : if for @xmath182 the system is dominated by interactions , @xmath183 should decay in a way typical of high - temperature hamiltonian systems , i.e.  exponentially ; if the system is dominated by soc constraints , @xmath183 should decay in accordance with ( [ eq : pkl ] ) .",
    "the results for a rather high temperature @xmath159 , where the ising interactions should not play a significant role , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_hcorels ] .",
    "the log - log plot in the inset confirms validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkl ] ) .",
    "similar results were also obtained for all temperatures @xmath184 , whereas for @xmath185 an exponential fit was also possible .",
    "we explain this as follows .",
    "generally one can expect that for temperatures @xmath182 the decay rate of @xmath183 will have both power - law ( soc ) and exponential ( thermodynamic ) contributions , the former proportional to @xmath186 and the latter proportional to @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the correlation length .",
    "for @xmath2 large enough , the power - law should dominate , but for smaller distances , like those available in computer simulations , @xmath183 may be dominated by the exponential term , especially for temperatures closer to ( but larger than ) @xmath0 , as in this case the thermodynamic correlation length gets large and the exponential term can exceed the rapidly decaying algebraic term @xmath186 .",
    "another reason why we did not confirm ( [ eq : pkl ] ) for @xmath185 is that as the system gets cooler , the ising interactions become more pronounced .",
    "as one of their effect is to reduce the number of sites with @xmath189 , the statistics for exploring @xmath183 becomes too poor for reliable data analysis .",
    "validity of equation ( [ eq : pkl ] ) for @xmath190 can be also justified by the following physical argument .",
    "suppose that the role of interactions , above @xmath0 , is restricted to flipping some spins from @xmath191 to @xmath192 , with a probability @xmath193 , in an _ uncorrelated _ manner .",
    "this reduces @xmath183 by a factor @xmath194 .",
    "consequently , @xmath183 should satisfy ( [ eq : pkl ] ) also for finite temperatures , with the ratio @xmath195 independent of @xmath91 . and indeed , our estimates of this ratio for @xmath196 and @xmath117 yield a constant value @xmath197 .",
    "we conclude that the system preserves the soc - induced correlations at all temperatures @xmath190 .",
    "note , however , that this has absolutely no impact on the thermodynamic properties of the system .     of finding two empty lattice nodes @xmath2 units apart for @xmath119 and @xmath198 .",
    "the dotted line is a fit calculated from ( [ eq : pkl ] ) .",
    "the inset presents the log - log plot of @xmath199 .",
    "the error bars are of order @xmath200 ( not shown ) .",
    "[ fig : fig_hcorels ] ]",
    "we found that the spin-1 ising model with nonlocal constraints imposed by the bak - tang - wiesenfeld sandpile model , which is expected to exhibit some features of both thermodynamic and self - organized criticality , behaves just like a standard model of statistical physics , with all hallmarks of a continuous phase transition .",
    "our analysis shows that the power - law correlations induced by the ` self - organized criticality ' of the sandpile model have no impact on the order of the phase transition in the hamiltonian subsystem .",
    "in particular , we found that the critical exponent @xmath201 , which suggests that the hybrid model belongs to the same universality class as the standard ising model .",
    "similarly , hamiltonian interactions of the ising model can not destroy `` criticality '' ( i.e.  power - law correlations ) of the btw sandpile model above the thermodynamic @xmath0 .",
    "however , unlike thermodynamic criticality , long - range correlations induced by the self - organized criticality do not show up in thermodynamic functions ( for example , they do not affect temperature dependence of the specific heat ) . clearly , the long - range order induced by hamiltonian interactions has different impact on the thermodynamics than that induced by using the soc model to reduce the phase space of the system .",
    "even though the spin and sandpile models we chose belong to the simplest models in their kind , their combination results in a model that seems intractable mathematically and is very difficult to treat numerically  hence the rather limited system sizes used in the present study .",
    "it is surely of interest to find a different combination of hamiltonian and soc models that would exhibit a similar combination of thermodynamic and soc criticality effects , yet would be easier to deal with .    compared with the phase space of the standard ising model , the phase space volume of the hybrid model is significantly reduced ( from @xmath33 down to @xmath34 with @xmath35 ) in a non - local manner .",
    "such reduction resembles that associated with lowering of the system dimensionality and hence may affect the critical properties of the system .",
    "we have shown that it actually decreases the number of possible phases .",
    "even though our study indicates that the critical exponent @xmath202 in the hybrid model takes on the same value as in the ising model , the question remains whether the two systems belong exactly to the same universality class and other exponents should be also examined .",
    "another problem is to investigate the decay of correlation functions as @xmath203 .",
    "last , but not least , our numerical results indicate that in the btw model on a honeycomb lattice of linear size @xmath36 , the probabilities @xmath204 to find @xmath46 grains in a given lattice site take on particularly simple values , @xmath76 , @xmath205 , and @xmath78 ."
