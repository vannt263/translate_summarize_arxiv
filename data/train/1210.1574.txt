    "in the hierarchical paradigm of large scale structure ( lss ) formation , galaxy clusters are the largest object ever to virialize . with masses in excess of @xmath3",
    ", they are located at the nodes of the cosmic web , where they accrete matter from the surrounding voids and through large scale filaments . due to their vast size ,",
    "galaxy clusters resemble island universes seen at great distance , providing a powerful cosmological probe and a unique astrophysical laboratory .",
    "the gas accreted by a cluster is thought to abruptly heat and slow down in a strong virial shock wave surrounding the cluster .",
    "such collisionless shocks are thought , by analogy with supernova remnant shocks , to accelerate charged particles to @xmath4 energies , where they compton - scatter cosmic - microwave background ( cmb ) photons up to the @xmath0-ray band@xcite .",
    "consequently , one expects to find @xmath0-ray rings around clusters@xcite , as indicated by cosmological simulations@xcite , which suggest an elliptic morphology elongated towards the large - scale filaments feeding the cluster@xcite .",
    "such rings are also expected in hard x - rays@xcite , and should coincide with a synchrotron radio ring@xcite and with a cutoff in the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signal@xcite .",
    "however , no such virial shock signature was detected so far , although a stacking analysis of egret data around a sample of 447 rich clusters did show a @xmath5 signal@xcite .",
    "upper limit were imposed on the @xmath0-ray emission from clusters such as coma@xcite , but mostly focusing on the central parts of the cluster , well within the virial radius .",
    "the very existence of cluster - scale virial shocks has thus remained unconfirmed .",
    "the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) is one of the richest nearby clusters . with mass @xmath6 , temperature @xmath7 , and richness class 2 ,",
    "it lies only @xmath8 away@xcite , at a redshift @xmath9 .",
    "its virial radius , @xmath10 , corresponds to an angular radius @xmath11 , where subscript @xmath12 refers to an enclosed density @xmath12 times above the critical value .",
    "the cluster is somewhat elongated in the east - west direction , in coincidence with the western lss filament@xcite that connects it with the cluster abell 1367 ( see figure [ fig : sdss ] ) .",
    "there is x - ray , optical , weak lensing , radio@xcite , and sz@xcite evidence that the cluster is accreting clumpy matter and experiencing weak shocks towards the filament well within the virial radius , at @xmath13 radii .",
    "the veritas erenkov array has produced a @xmath14 diameter @xmath0-ray mosaic@xcite of coma , at energies @xmath15 .",
    "we argue that the significance map ( figure [ fig : comaver ] ) shows extended @xmath0-ray emission away from the center , that appears as a thick ( @xmath16 ) elliptical ring with semi - minor axis @xmath17 , elongated along the east  west direction , with semi - major to semi - minor axes ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the ring is seen at a @xmath19 confidence level ( effectively a single - parameter fit , estimated using mock veritas noise maps ; see figures [ fig : comaverbin ] and [ fig : comavertilt ] and  [ sec : veritas ] ) .",
    "however , the data was taken in @xmath20 wobble mode@xcite , inappropriate for extended emission on larger scales ; correcting for the excessive background removal indicates a @xmath21 signal .",
    "x - ray and galaxy maps suggest that the lss filament and the semi - major axis of the thermal gas distribution are slightly tilted southwest , at an angle @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , the significance of the @xmath0-ray structure is maximized when thus tilted ; the best fit is obtained for @xmath23 and @xmath24 . if no assumption is made regarding @xmath25 , the ring significance weakens to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 corrected ) .",
    "the size and morphology of the veritas ring resemble the predicted @xmath0-ray signature of a coma - like , @xmath28 and @xmath7 cluster in a @xmath29cdm simulation@xcite . the simulated map ( figure [ fig : comasim ] ) , oriented such that the major simulated lss filament lies to the west and normalized for a nominal @xmath30 wobble - mode veritas detection ( no remaining free parameters )",
    ", correlates with the veritas map at the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 corrected ) confidence level .",
    "the ring brightness agrees with predictions too , if the relativistic electron fraction @xmath33 of the thermal energy accretion rate @xmath34 ( normalized by the total thermal energy over a hubble time ) is a few percent .",
    "the associated @xmath35 flux at @xmath36 energies can explain the hard x - ray signal observed in coma@xcite .",
    "similar , @xmath37 values are inferred from the @xmath5 egret stacking analysis@xcite , and from lss hard x - ray sources@xcite .    in order to examine the coincident radio signals , we spectrally decompose the wmap seven - year , full - sky maps@xcite into synchrotron and thermal sz maps . excluding the inner , @xmath38 part of the cluster , the veritas data correlates with the synchrotron map at a @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) confidence level ( figure [ fig : compositeversyn ] ) , and anti - correlates with the sz signal at @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the radio signals are stronger in the western half of the ring , towards the lss filament , where the correlations strengthen up to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) with the synchrotron and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) with the sz .",
    "these peripheral radio signals agree with predictions for the synchrotron emission from the @xmath0-ray emitting electrons , and for the sz decline with thermal pressure beyond the shock , provided that @xmath47 magnetic fields are found downstream , corresponding to @xmath48 magnetization .",
    "bright spots along the ring suggest local enhancements , up to @xmath49 a few times its mean value .    while the sz signal , extending in some parts out to @xmath50 , agrees with sz detections by wmap@xcite and planck@xcite , the peripheral synchrotron signal coincident with the @xmath0-rays and with the sz cutoff was not reported so far .",
    "note that the @xmath0-ray ring and these radio features are much farther out than the @xmath51 weak shocks previously reported based on x - ray , radio@xcite , and sz@xcite data .",
    "inside the @xmath52 ellipse , the veritas and synchrotron maps show a @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) anti - correlation , mainly ( @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) ) in the west , evident from the @xmath0-ray underluminous radio halo and relic ( figure [ fig : compositeversyn ] ) .",
    "such a signature , predicted in secondary models@xcite where cosmic - ray ion collisions inject relativistic electrons in both strongly ( @xmath57 ) and weakly magnetized regions , which consequently appear radio bright/@xmath0-ray faint and vice versa , is unnatural in primary models where electrons are ( re)accelerated in turbulence@xcite or weak shocks .",
    "secondary electrons can explain radio halos@xcite , relics@xcite and minihalos@xcite as arising from the same cosmic - ray distribution , if the latter is nearly homogeneous@xcite .",
    "the extent and magnitude of the anti - correlation observed , if confirmed , support such secondary models , and favor an extended cosmic - ray distribution .",
    "a future veritas observation deeper than the present @xmath58 hour exposure would decisively test our results , in particular if wobble - mode corrections are minimized . this would allow a more precise reconstruction of the virial shock and a measure of variations in the electron deposition rate along the shock front .",
    "such data is valuable in the study of lss formation at low redshifts , mapping the feeding pattern of coma , probing the surrounding voids and filaments , and tracing the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) immediately behind the shock .",
    "a detailed , more significant anti - correlation between @xmath0-ray and synchrotron maps at inner , @xmath59 radii would confirm the hadronic , secondary electron model for cluster radio sources , and provide a direct measure of magnetic variations in the icm .",
    "a deeper @xmath0-ray observation would thus probe the cosmic - ray proton distribution out to large radii , address the origin of these protons , and place an upper limit on proton acceleration in the virial shock .",
    "the veritas energy threshold , @xmath60 , is not far below the expected photon cutoff , @xmath61 .",
    "observations at higher energies would become increasingly sensitive to this cutoff , thus probing the conditions at the shock .",
    "interestingly , no evidence for extended emission was found in a @xmath62 observation of coma by the hess telescopes@xcite , with @xmath63 the sensitivity in the veritas mosaic , but the @xmath0-ray ring may be shallowly buried in the hess noise .    calibrating analytic@xcite , and numerical@xcite estimates with the above @xmath64 and @xmath65 values , yields @xmath66 inverse - compton and @xmath67 synchrotron cumulative backgrounds from cluster shocks . these constitute fair fractions of the @xmath0-ray and low - frequency radio signals observed far from the galactic plane , and dominate the respective diffuse extragalactic backgrounds@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : veritas ] we show that an elongated @xmath0-ray ring around coma was observed by the veritas erenkov array . methods to correct for excessive wobble - mode background subtraction are discussed in general in  [ sec : wobble ] , and specifically for cross - correlation analyses in  [ sec : crosscorrelations ] .",
    "contamination by galactic foregrounds is shown to be negligible in  [ sec : galactic ] .",
    "the @xmath0-ray ring is shown to agree with simulation - based predictions in  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "significant correlations with both synchrotron and sz maps are presented in  [ sec : radio ] . in  [ sec : inversecompton ] we show that the @xmath0-ray signal agrees with predictions , if the shock deposits a few percent of the thermal energy per hubble time in relativistic electrons . in  [ sec : radiotheory ] we show that the synchrotron and sz signals also agree with the predictions , if magnetic fields carry @xmath48 of the thermal energy .",
    "a @xmath0-ray  radio anti - correlation inward of the @xmath0-ray ring is interpreted in  [ sec : inneremission ] as possible preliminary evidence for strong local magnetization and secondary electron injection at small radii .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a simple @xmath68-model of the shock is provided in appendix [ sec : betamodel ] .",
    "we adopt a concordance flat @xmath29cdm model with hubble constant @xmath69 , a baryon fraction @xmath70 , and a hydrogen mass fraction @xmath71 .",
    "the plasma is approximated as an ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath72 and mean particle mass @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the proton mass .",
    "colorbars are square - weighted .",
    "veritas has produced a @xmath14 diameter @xmath0-ray mosaic@xcite of coma , at energies @xmath75 .",
    "the significance map ( figure [ fig : comaver ] ) , taken in @xmath20 wobble mode@xcite with a @xmath76 integration radius , shows some extended @xmath0-ray emission away from the center .",
    "the @xmath0-ray structure appears as an elliptical ring , elongated along the east - west direction , or as two parallel filaments lying symmetrically both north and south of the cluster .",
    "the spectrum in the veritas band is probably flat , as a @xmath77 photon spectral index was used to optimize the gamma - hadron separation cuts@xcite . in  [ sec : inversecompton ] we show that a flat spectrum with index @xmath78 ( equal energy per logarithmic energy interval ) is consistent with observations at lower energies .",
    "denote the veritas significance map by @xmath79 .",
    "the data is taken in wobble mode@xcite , where a pixel of significance @xmath79 means that in a beam of radius @xmath76 centered upon the pixel , there are @xmath80 counts in excess of the anticipated @xmath81 background events , where @xmath82 and the background is estimated based on a @xmath83 ring around the pixel . a @xmath84 analysis@xcite shows a background of about @xmath85 photon counts above @xmath86 in such a @xmath76 bin .",
    "the background per pixel is denoted by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of pixels in the beam .",
    "first we assume that the background is uniform , so the pixels are not correlated before the beam integration . the nominal significance of an extended source",
    "may then be estimated as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are respectively the total significance and the number of pixels enclosed .    in order to quantify the @xmath0-ray structure and assess its significance",
    ", we fit the data with a thick , elliptical ring model .",
    "the center of the ellipse is chosen as the rosat x - ray peak . the median semi - major axis @xmath92 is taken along the east - west direction , as inferred from the rosat map and from the orientation of the sdss galaxy filament .",
    "the thickness of the ring is fixed at @xmath93 along the semi - minor axis , because a thicker ring would exceed the @xmath94 limit imposed by the wobble - mode background subtraction bins ( figure [ fig : comaver ] ) , so @xmath95 exceeds @xmath96 at oblique angles . ] .",
    "the ring is then defined by its median semi - minor axis @xmath97 and elongation ratio @xmath98 , taken as two free parameters . however , for sufficient elongation , @xmath99 , the results ( figures [ fig : comaverbin ] and [ fig : comavertilt ] ) depend weakly upon @xmath100 .",
    "the ( effectively single - parameter ) fit then indicates an extended structure around @xmath17 , found at an @xmath101 nominal significance level .",
    "the sdss ( figure [ fig : sdss ] ) and rosat maps suggest that the lss filament and the semi - major axis of the gas distribution are slightly tilted towards the southwest , at an angle @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , the significance of the @xmath0-ray structure is maximized when tilted at precisely such angles ( figure [ fig : comavertilt ] ) .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    a more reliable way to estimate",
    "the significance of the extended emission is to apply the same elliptical templates to a large sample ( @xmath102 ) of mock significance maps , containing random noise but no signal .",
    "we prepare these maps by injecting poisson noise at the observed background level to the veritas mosaic template , integrating over the same @xmath76 beam , and converting to a significance map using either the mean background or a simulated @xmath20 wobble - mode background .",
    "none of the resulting mock maps shows a signal as strong as the observed @xmath103 , so we extrapolate to the high significance levels assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "the resulting significance levels are shown as dashed curves in figure [ fig : comaverbin ] , for elliptical rings elongated in the east - west direction ( based on 1000 maps at a given @xmath104 ) .",
    "if we make no a - priori assumption regarding the ring orientation @xmath25 , but rather choose in each mock map the value @xmath25 that maximizes its nominal ring significance , we obtain higher mock detection levels , shown as dot - dashed contours in the figure ( based on 200 maps , each scanned with @xmath105 tilt intervals ) .",
    "the results depend weakly ( within the statistical fluctuations ) on @xmath104 .",
    "the mock statistics indicate that the veritas ring presents at the @xmath19 confidence level if we assume that it is aligned with the lss filament , and at @xmath26 confidence if we make no a - priori assumption regarding @xmath25 .",
    "these conservative estimates are based on the mean background , and are approximately independent of @xmath100 ; higher , @xmath106 significance levels are obtained when wobble - mode is used to estimate the mock background . as we show in  [ sec : wobble ] below , the detection significance for such extended structures is actually higher , @xmath21 for east - west alignment , and @xmath107 for arbitrary @xmath25 .",
    "the signal is locally on the order of @xmath108 of the noise , and stronger than the average galactic foreground at these energies@xcite ( see  [ sec : inversecompton ] ) . in the coma region ,",
    "the expected galactic foreground is relatively low , spatially smooth , and featureless on @xmath109 scales ; see  [ sec : galactic ] .",
    "wobble - background subtraction is highly efficient in removing smooth foregrounds ; a disadvantage is that it also removes much of the signal for extended sources .    in wobble mode ,",
    "an estimated background is subtracted based on a ring of radius @xmath110 around each pixel .",
    "this method , appropriate for point sources , distorts and smears out features extended over scales comparable or larger than @xmath110 . as we show below",
    ", analyses of the @xmath0-ray features , of a histogram of the @xmath0-ray pixels , and of wobble simulations , indicate that the wobble subtraction reduces the significance of the extended features observed by at least @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the corrected significance of a @xmath0-ray ring aligned with the lss filament is estimated as @xmath21 .",
    "consider the wobble - induced correlation between @xmath0-ray pixels . due to the wobble background subtraction",
    ", the significance of a pixel is anti - correlated with the pixels @xmath83 around it .",
    "one implication is that sources that extend over scales much larger than @xmath110 are effectively erased by the background subtraction , except in an @xmath112 wide band in their periphery .",
    "in such a band , and in sources that extend @xmath113 in at least one direction , the signal is diminished but not completely erased . for example , the estimated signal at the inner edge of a large linear source will be diminished by a factor of two , and the signal at the outer edge will have an equal but negative significance .",
    "therefore , for sources that extend over @xmath114 in at least one direction , the actual significance may be @xmath115 times higher than estimated from the wobble - mode map .    in order to quantify",
    "the effect wobble - mode has on the signal , we examine the distribution of @xmath0-ray significance pixels , using the same @xmath76 integration beam applied to the map .",
    "the significance histogram ( figure [ fig : ver_hist ] ) , taken with @xmath116 intervals , can be modeled@xcite as a single gaussian function , with adjusted coefficient of determination @xmath117 .",
    "however , the histogram shows peak deviations and sharp cutoffs , indicating a more complicated underlying distribution .",
    "indeed , a simple model combining two gaussian functions provides a much better fit to the data ( @xmath118 ; note that @xmath119 improves slowly near @xmath120 ) .",
    "the best fit is obtained for gaussian means @xmath121 and @xmath122 , with corresponding standard deviations @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the data were also modelled as the sum of two gaussian functions constrained to have the same standard deviation ; the resulting best fit is similar to the unconstrained sum : @xmath125 and @xmath126 , with standard deviation @xmath127 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "both fits suggest that a signal is present in the map , with pixels that are on average @xmath128 above the noise .",
    "interestingly , a histogram of the pixels found only in the central , @xmath129 wide region of the map agrees much better with a single gaussian@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the additional signal is found at radii @xmath130 , in agreement with the inferred ring .",
    "the above arguments indicate that the local pixel significance should in fact be @xmath131 higher than it appears in the significance map ( figure [ fig : comaver ] ) .",
    "this imposes a lower limit @xmath132 to the correction factor needed in order to estimate the significance of an extended structure or of a cross - correlation signal ( see  [ sec : crosscorrelations ] ) with respect to the true background .",
    "we conservatively use @xmath111 for extended emission exceeding the beam size .",
    "another indication that such a correction is needed are the negative , @xmath133 significance regions , lying just outside the bright feature we identify as a ring .",
    "assuming that the bright region is part of an extended , linear structure , this suggests that its local significance should be @xmath134 higher than it appears .",
    "another way to assess the effect of wobble background subtraction is to apply it to a simulated cluster map .",
    "we thus normalize the @xmath0-ray map of the simulated cluster derived in  [ sec : simulation ] below , add homogeneous poisson noise , introduce a @xmath20 wobble - mode correction , and integrate over the @xmath76 beam . the normalization and background",
    "are chosen such that the final map thus obtained shows @xmath135 bright spots over a background comparable to the veritas background . for such parameters , a map identically prepared but with mean background , rather than wobble background subtraction , shows @xmath136 bright spots , implying a true significance @xmath137 higher than inferred in wobble - mode",
    ".    a @xmath0-ray structure that extends over scales much greater than @xmath110 would be largely erased by the wobble background subtraction .",
    "hence , the above estimates provide only a lower limit to the correction needed to determine the significance of such a structure .",
    "next , consider a cross - correlation between the veritas map @xmath79 and some potential tracer of the virial shock , @xmath138 .",
    "after binning the two maps onto some common grid , we compute the correlation as @xmath139 where the means @xmath140 , standard deviations @xmath141 , and number of pixels @xmath91 , pertain to the region being examined .",
    "the factor @xmath88 accounts for the correlation between pixels within the @xmath76 beam , ensuring that the result is approximately independent of the grid resolution .",
    "the significance of the correlation is determined by generating a large ( @xmath142 , converged ) sample of maps with randomly swapped pixels , and computing the corresponding significance distribution .",
    "consider the effect wobble - mode background subtraction has on such cross - correlations .",
    "as in the significance estimation discussed in  [ sec : wobble ] , any existing correlation is diminished because extended bright regions experience excessive background subtraction . however , the effect here is more severe , because background regions lying @xmath143 away from the bright structure are affected as well , appearing excessively faint .",
    "as such `` dark edges '' appear in the wobble - mode map but not in the tracers , the correlation is further diminished .",
    "the effect of wobble - mode background subtraction on a cross - correlations signal can be crudely estimated by correlating mock tracers with simulated @xmath0-ray maps , prepared with ( _ e.g. , _ figure [ fig : comasimwobble ] ) and without ( _ e.g. , _ figure [ fig : comasim ] ) wobble background subtraction .",
    "we generate mock tracers by adding random noise of various mean amplitude to the significance map of the simulated cluster , smoothed with a gaussian filter of standard deviation @xmath144 .",
    "the results are well - fit by a wobble correction factor @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the nominal significance of the cross - correlation using the wobble - mode signal , @xmath147 is the true significance , and @xmath148 is the solid angle involved .    for example , for the typical @xmath149 of wmap , the @xmath150 correlation found ( see  [ sec : radio ] below ) between @xmath0-ray and synchrotron emission outside the inner @xmath52 ellipse bounding the @xmath0-ray structure from below yields a corrected @xmath151 confidence level .",
    "as pointed out in  [ sec : wobble ] , these corrections are only lower limits if the @xmath0-ray structure is more extended than the simulated ring used to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrwobble ] ) .",
    "when averaged over large angular scales , the galactic foreground anticipated above @xmath86 based on fermi observations@xcite is lower by at least a factor of a few than the ring signal ( see  [ sec : inversecompton ] ) .",
    "moreover , galactic signals on @xmath152 scales are efficiently removed from the veritas map by the wobble - mode background correction .",
    "next , we show that no significant galactic contamination on @xmath153 scales is expected in the veritas mosaic of coma .",
    "the main @xmath0-ray galactic foregrounds at intermediate latitudes arise from _",
    "( i)_inverse compton emission from cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons ; _",
    "( ii)_relativistic bremsstrahlung of cr electrons with the interstellar plasma ; and _ ( iii)_nucleon - nucleon scattering between cr ions and the interstellar medium .",
    "the crs are unlikely to show significant structure on @xmath154 scales , as this would require @xmath155 magnetic fields at @xmath156 distances . moreover ,",
    "synchrotron maps@xcite show relatively very little emission from the coma region .",
    "therefore , the galactic foreground on small scales is dominated by electron bremsstrahlung and by @xmath157 decay from nucleon collisions , both approximately following the distribution of gas along the line of sight .",
    "hence , we may estimate the galactic contamination remaining in the veritas map using gas tracers , such as the full - sky h@xmath158 @xcite and infrared dust emission@xcite maps ( figure [ fig : galactictracers ] ) .",
    "both tracers indicate a very low level of galactic structure in the coma region , and towards the @xmath0-ray ring in particular , with only minor structure found mainly in the east .",
    "we confirm this using a spectral linear regression of the seven - year wmap data , outlined in  [ sec : radio ] .",
    "both tracers show no positive correlation with the veritas map , ruling out any significant remaining galactic contamination .",
    "note that synchrotron tracers should not be used here to estimate or eliminate the galactic foreground .",
    "first , these tracers are inefficient as they follow the smooth cr electron distribution .",
    "more importantly , they include an interesting synchrotron signal from the coma virial ring , as we argue in  [ sec : radio ] .",
    "the veritas signal can be assessed by comparing it to the @xmath0-ray signature of a simulated coma - like cluster in a @xmath29cdm simulation@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray signal was computed by injecting relativistic electrons at the strong shocks of the simulation , with a mach number - dependent power - law spectrum given by the fermi diffusive shock acceleration model .",
    "these electrons were assumed to carry a fraction @xmath33 of the thermal post - shock energy ; see  [ sec : inversecompton ] for details .",
    "we choose the richest cluster in the @xmath159 simulation box , found@xcite to have a coma - like mass @xmath160 and temperature @xmath7 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the simulated virial shock ( figure [ fig : comasim ] ) has an elliptic structure , elongated towards the main lss filament ( figure [ fig : sdss ] ) , with semi - minor axis @xmath17 and semi - major axis @xmath161 ( at the distance of coma ) ; the average @xmath162 spectral index is @xmath163 .",
    "the shock elongation , the morphology of the surrounding filaments , and the enhanced accretion towards the main filament , suggest a prolate geometry aligned with the main filament feeding the cluster .",
    "unrelaxed , merger clusters such as coma are indeed known to preferentially be prolate@xcite .",
    "the center of the simulated cluster is determined by the peak density .",
    "the simulated map is rotated about this point such that the main simulated lss filament coincides with the @xmath164 orientation of the sdss filament and the rosat ellipse . by coincidence , the agreement between the simulated filaments and the sdss map remains fairly good even far from the cluster , if the simulated map is inverted along the semi - major axis of the virial shock ( figure [ fig : comasim2 ] ) .",
    "the simulated @xmath0-ray signal shows a positive correlation with the veritas map ( figure [ fig : comaversim ] ) , at the @xmath31 confidence level ( @xmath32 after correcting for the excessive wobble - mode background subtraction ; see  [ sec : wobble ] ) .",
    "the correlation remains strong , @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) , if the maps are rotated by @xmath167 with respect to each other .",
    "the extent of the virial shock may be somewhat overestimated by the adiabatic , smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation .",
    "indeed , the correlation strengthens to @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) if the simulated map is resized by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath171 of the cluster , normalized by the mass - to - hubble time ratio in the dimensionless parameter @xmath172 , varies among clusters and fluctuates in time , and is found@xcite to be somewhat low when averaged over the simulated cluster , @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray map shown in figure [ fig : comasim ] corresponds to normalized average accretion rate @xmath174 , and an acceleration efficiency @xmath175 .",
    "equivalently , we may examine the accretion rate of the total thermal energy @xmath176 , using the dimensionless parameter @xmath177 .",
    "in the simulation ,",
    "we find@xcite @xmath178 , although slightly larger , @xmath179 values arise in a simple isothermal sphere model@xcite .",
    "in order to quantify the coincidence between @xmath0-ray and radio signals , we analyze the wmap seven - year , full - sky maps@xcite .",
    "we use a simple spectral decomposition of the five wmap bands into synchrotron and sz maps , avoiding any spatial masking which may complicate the comparison to the veritas map .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum is approximated as a pure power - law , with brightness @xmath180 and spectral index @xmath181 , typical of cluster radio sources ; the results are not sensitive to the precise spectrum for @xmath182 .",
    "the sz signal is clear in the central parts of coma , but is difficult to spectrally separate from the cmb fluctuations at large radii@xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we leave these cmb fluctuations in the sz map , thus somewhat diluting any correlations with the veritas map .",
    "in general , the wmap data includes non - negligible foregrounds from galactic synchrotron , dust and free - free emission@xcite , which are strong towards the galactic plane and in principal should be removed . however , as discussed in  [ sec : galactic ] , these signals are particularly weak in the coma region ( figure [ fig : galactictracers ] ) , are spatially too smooth ( in particular the synchrotron foreground ) to have a @xmath0-ray counterpart surviving the wobble - mode background removal , and their tracers do not correlate with the veritas map .",
    "moreover , the extragalactic synchrotron signal can not be separated from the galactic @xmath183 synchrotron , @xmath184 dust , and @xmath185 free - free signals , using spectral regression alone , in particular considering the varying synchrotron spectral index in the cluster radio sources .",
    "therefore , we leave these faint and probably smooth galactic contaminations in our synchrotron extragalactic tracer .",

    "features seen in both sz and synchrotron maps are more pronounced in the western part of the cluster , possibly due to some eastern foreground ( _ e.g. , _ see figure [ fig : halpha ] ) or cmb fluctuation .",

    "more importantly , when we split the data into two regions , outside and inside the inner @xmath52 ellipse bounding the @xmath0-ray signal , correlations emerge between @xmath0-rays and both radio signals . outside this inner ellipse ,",
    "i.e. along the @xmath0-ray ring , the veritas map correlates with the synchrotron map at the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) confidence level , and anti - correlates with the sz map at the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) level .",

    "electrons magnetized above ( below ) @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the cmb energy density , lose most of their energy to synchrotron ( inverse - compton ) radiation in the radio ( @xmath0-ray ) band@xcite , leading to alternating radio- and @xmath0-ray - bright regions , as discussed in  [ sec : inneremission ] .",
    "cluster virial shocks last for long , @xmath203 hubble timescales , and are strong , in particular where cold gas accretes from the voids and the mach number squared is @xmath204 .",

    "the inverse - compton emission from the shock can be estimated by assuming that a fraction @xmath215 of the post - shock thermal energy is deposited in relativistic electrons .",
    "electrons with energies @xmath216 cool quickly , in a narrow shell behind the shock , so the logarithmic emissivity per unit surface area of the shock is @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the ( thermal ) electron number density , and @xmath219 is the downstream velocity .",

    "this rate varies spatially along the shock front , fluctuates in time , and differs even among similar clusters as a function of their specific environment .",

    "a beam that intersects the cut at distances @xmath223 from the center covers a shock segment of length @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , at the near edge of a long cylindrical shock of angular radius @xmath225 , a beam of area @xmath84 would detect @xmath226 energy photons with number flux @xmath227 a similar result is expected in the prolate shock inferred in coma , where for the veritas map @xmath228 in the isothermal @xmath68-model , this may be written as @xmath229 .    in order to compare this estimate with the @xmath0-ray structure seen in the veritas map , recall that a @xmath230 fluctuation corresponds to an excess of @xmath231 photons with @xmath15 in a beam of radius @xmath76 .",

    "note that at such low energies , the galactic foreground is not negligible , and both instruments lack the high angular resolution of veritas essential in order to identify the ring and avoid foreground contamination .",
    "the above analysis assumed a flat spectrum of accelerated electrons , leading to a flat ( @xmath78 ) photon spectrum . indeed , comparing the veritas measurement with the egret upper limit implies that the photon spectral index between @xmath251 and @xmath86 can not be much softer than @xmath252 .",

    "the same electrons that scatter cmb photons up to the @xmath0-ray band also emit synchrotron radiation , as they gyrate in the shock amplified magnetic fields . the ratio between radio and @xmath0-ray emission from a strong virial shock is approximately given by the ratio between magnetic and cmb energy densities , @xmath256    in order to compute the synchrotron signal , some assumption must be made concerning the magnetic field behind the shock .",
    "typically@xcite , one assumes that a fraction @xmath257 of the thermal energy is deposited in downstream magnetic fields , based on observations of supernova remnant shocks ; some magnetization is also needed to accelerate the @xmath0-ray emitting electrons . however",
    ", this assumption was not tested so far near the virial shock , and the value of @xmath65 is not well constrained .",
    "we may use the coincident @xmath0-ray and radio measurements to estimate the magnetic field at the shock .",
    "the strongest signal is found in the lowest wmap frequency , @xmath258 , where bright spots along the shock show @xmath259 , corresponding to a brightness @xmath260 the same bright spots are detected by veritas at @xmath237 , corresponding to @xmath261 . equation ( [ eq : gamma_to_synch ] ) then yields @xmath262 , which according to the @xmath68-model corresponds to @xmath263 .",
    "we may use the sz signal near the shock to test the above estimates .",
    "for example , at @xmath258 one expects the ratio between the synchrotron emission and the sz decrement to be @xmath264 for an isothermal sphere distribution@xcite , and @xmath265 for a @xmath68-model ( see appendix [ sec : betamodel ] ) .    inspecting the coincident synchrotron ( @xmath266 at @xmath267 ) and sz ( @xmath268 ) signals measured along the @xmath0-ray ring , we find that @xmath269 .",
    "this supports the above estimates @xmath236 , and @xmath48 .",

    "this signal is not highly significant ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 , before and after correcting for wobble background removal ) , so deeper observations are needed to clarify its nature .",
    "here we consider the implications of the anti - correlation assuming it is indeed real .",
    "in such a case , as the synchrotron signal involved is dominated by the radio halo and radio relic , some of the veritas signal must arise from the inner icm , well inside the virial radius .    in the radio band",
    ", coma is a classical example of a merging cluster , harboring both an extended radio halo and a peripheral radio relic@xcite .",
    "the @xmath270 mpc size of such radio halos implies an ongoing injection of relativistic electrons , but it is debated whether they arise from hadronic collisions involving cr ions ( secondary models@xcite ) or from in - situ ( re)acceleration in weak shocks or turbulence ( primary models@xcite ) .",
    "secondary models can also explain radio relics@xcite and minihalos@xcite as arising from the same distribution of cr protons , if the latter are homogeneously distributed@xcite . here ,",
    "radio - bright regions correspond to strong , @xmath271 magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of such strongly magnetized regions is also being debated , in coma@xcite and in other clusters@xcite .    in secondary models ,",
    "electron injection is an ongoing process , proportional to the gas density but largely independent of shocks , turbulence , and other changes in the flow .",
    "therefore , the sum of synchrotron and inverse - compton emission from the icm varies slowly across the cluster , whereas their ratio can show strong variations , proportional to @xmath272 , leading to a radio@xmath0-ray anti - correlation .",
    "in contrast , in primary models , the electrons are injected only locally , in shocks or turbulence where the magnetic field is amplified , and cool long before the magnetic field can decay .",
    "hence , a positive correlation is expected here between synchrotron and @xmath0-ray signals ; inverse - compton emission far from the radio sources is expected to be negligible .    in both secondary and primary models ,",
    "@xmath0-ray emission is expected also from @xmath157 decay , following cr ion collisions with the ambient nucleons .",
    "this signal is expected to be smoother than the inverse - compton emission , and so more susceptible to wobble - mode background subtraction , in particular if the crs are distributed homogeneously , as inferred from hadronic radio models@xcite .",
    "for example , in a @xmath68-model with homogeneous cr ions , wobble - mode removes @xmath273 of the signal in the central @xmath274 beam , which corresponds to the magnetized core , and @xmath275 of the signal beyond @xmath276 .",
    "the @xmath157 signal , independent of the local magnetic field and stronger in the center , should positively correlate with the synchrotron map , which is dominated by the central radio halo .",
    "it can not account for the anti - correlation presently observed .",
    "therefore , the inner @xmath0-ray  synchrotron anti - correlation , if confirmed , supports the notion of magnetized , @xmath57 regions in the icm , and favors a secondary electron injection model . here , the presence of a weak @xmath0-ray signal far from the center ( but inward of the virial shock ) supports a homogeneous cr proton distribution . in non - magnetized regions ,",

    "if wobble - mode corrections can be minimized , the ( @xmath282 times stronger@xcite ) @xmath157 signal may be measured as well .",
    "we analyze the veritas mosaic ( figure [ fig : comaver ] ) of the coma cluster , and find a large - scale , extended @xmath0-ray feature around the cluster .",
    "it is best described as an elongated ( @xmath99 ) , thick ( @xmath283 ) elliptical ring , with semi - minor axis @xmath17 ( figure [ fig : comaverbin ] ) , oriented approximately along the east - west direction ( @xmath284 ; figure [ fig : comavertilt ] ) , towards the lss filament connecting coma with abell 1367 ( figure [ fig : sdss ] ) .",

    "<S> galaxy clusters , the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe , are thought to grow by accreting mass from their surroundings through large - scale virial shocks . due to electron acceleration in such a shock , it should appear as a @xmath0-ray , hard x - ray , and radio ring , elongated towards the large - scale filaments feeding the cluster , coincident with a cutoff in the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signal . </S>",
    "<S> however , no such signature was found so far , and the very existence of cluster virial shocks has remained a theory . </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of a large , @xmath1 diameter @xmath0-ray ring around the coma cluster , elongated towards the large scale filament connecting coma and abell 1367 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-ray ring correlates both with a synchrotron signal and with the sz cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-ray , hard - x - ray , and radio signatures agree with analytic and numerical predictions , if the shock deposits a few percent of the thermal energy in relativistic electrons over a hubble time , and @xmath2 of the energy in magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the implied inverse - compton and synchrotron cumulative emission from similar shocks dominates the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray and low frequency radio backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal the prolate structure of the hot gas in coma , the feeding pattern of the cluster , and properties of the surrounding large scale voids and filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the anticipated detection of such shocks around other clusters would provide a powerful new cosmological probe .    </S>",
