    "<S> given two systems , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath11 , the output state @xmath12  is always separable , where @xmath13 is the identity channel applied to system @xmath9 and @xmath14 is the eb channel applied to system @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the input systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 were initially entangled ( here denoted by the notation @xmath15 ) , the output systems @xmath9 and @xmath16 are separable ( here denoted by the notation @xmath5 ) .    the standard model of decoherence is assumed to be markovian , where the travelling systems are subject to memoryless channels . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , consider the case of direct distribution depicted in the panel  ( 1 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scenario ] . in the standard markovian description , </S>",
    "<S> the entangled state @xmath11 of the input systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 is subject to a tensor product of channels @xmath17 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there is clearly no way to distribute entanglement if both @xmath18 and @xmath14 are eb channels . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that charlie tries to share entanglement with one of the remote parties by sending one of the two systems while keeping the other ( one - system transmission ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , charlie may keep system @xmath9 while transmitting system @xmath10 to bob . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath19 destroys the initial entanglement , so that systems @xmath9 ( kept ) and @xmath16 ( transmitted ) are separable ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> symmetrically , the action of @xmath20 destroys the entanglement between system @xmath21 ( transmitted ) and system @xmath10 ( kept ) , i.e. , we have @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> then suppose that charlie sends both his systems to alice and bob ( two - system transmission ) . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy will also fail since the joint action of the two eb  channels is given by the tensor product @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , since we have one - system eb ( @xmath5 and @xmath0 ) then we must have two - system eb ( @xmath1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous reasoning can be extended to the case of indirect distribution as shown in panel ( 2 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scenario ] involving a bell measurement by charlie . since the environment is memoryless ( @xmath23 ) , we have that the absence of entanglement before the bell measurement ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is a sufficient condition for the swapping protocol to fail , i.e. , the remote systems @xmath24 and @xmath25 remains separable ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the previous case , if one - system transmission does not distribute entanglement , then two - system transmission can not lead to entanglement generation via the swapping protocol .    here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the previous implications for direct and indirect distribution of entanglement are false in the presence of a correlated - noise environment : two - system transmission can successfully distribute entanglement despite one - system transmission being subject to eb . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , by combining two eb  channels into a joint suitably - correlated environment , we can reactivate the distribution of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we will show the physical conditions under which the environmental correlations are able to trigger the reactivation , therefore breaking entanglement - breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable finding is that we do not need to consider an entangled state for the environment : the injection of separable correlations from the environment is sufficient for the restoration .    to better clarify these points , consider the schemes of direct and indirect distribution in the presence of a correlated - noise environment . in the scheme of direct distribution shown in panel  ( 3 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scenario ] , an input entangled state @xmath11 is jointly transformed into an output state @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the dilation of the composite channel @xmath27 is realized by introducing a two - system environment , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in a bipartite state @xmath30 , which interacts with the incoming systems via two unitaries @xmath31 ( transforming @xmath9 and @xmath28 ) and @xmath32 ( transforming @xmath10 and @xmath29 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqdil ] ) , we can always define the reduced channels , @xmath18 and @xmath14 , acting on the individual systems . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if only system @xmath10 is transmitted , then we have the evolved state @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar formula holds for the evolution of the other system @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , assuming that @xmath19 and @xmath39 are eb channels ( so that @xmath5 and @xmath40 ) , the composite channel @xmath27 can still preserve entanglement ( so that @xmath6 is possible ) . in other words , we have a paradoxical situation where charlie is not able to share entanglement with alice or bob , but still can distribute entanglement to them . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly an effect of the injected correlations coming from the environmental state @xmath30 . as mentioned earlier </S>",
    "<S> , our main finding is that these correlations do not need to be strong : entanglement distribution can be activated by separable correlations , i.e. , by an environment which is in a separable state @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> this effect of reactivation can also be extended to entanglement distillation , which typically requires stronger conditions than entanglement distribution ( demanded by the existence of effective distillation protocols ) . despite the individual channels are eb </S>",
    "<S> , their combination into a separable environment enables charlie to distribute distillable entanglement to alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to prove for an environment with finite memory , which can be decomposed as @xmath41    in our investigation , we also consider the case of entanglement swapping in a correlated - noise environment as depicted in panel  ( 4 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scenario ] . here alice and bob have two entangled states , @xmath42  and @xmath43 , respectively . systems @xmath24 and @xmath25 are retained , while systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 are transmitted to charlie , therefore undergoing the joint quantum channel @xmath27 . before the bell measurement , the global state is described by @xmath44~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> as before , we consider the case where the reduced channels , @xmath18 and @xmath14 , are eb channels , so that no entanglement survives before the bell measurement ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . if the environment has no memory ( @xmath46 ) there is no way to distribute entanglement to alice and bob ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , if the environment has memory ( @xmath47 ) , then entanglement distribution is possible ( @xmath7 ) and this distribution can be activated by a separable environmental state @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have the paradoxical situation where no bipartite entanglement survives at charlie s station ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , but still the swapping protocol is able to generate remote entanglement at alice s and bob s stations ( @xmath7 ) thanks to the separable correlations injected by the environment . as before , these separable correlations can be strong enough to distribute distillable entanglement to the remote parties .    </S>",
    "<S> the environmental reactivation of entanglement distribution can be proven  @xcite for quantum systems with hilbert spaces of any dimension , both finite ( discrete - variable systems ) and infinite ( continuous - variable systems  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the phenomenon of reactivation in direct distribution is not surprising in specific lossless scenarios where the environment is twirling , i.e. , a classical mixture of operators of the type @xmath48 or @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being a unitary  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is easy to find a fixed point in the joint map of the environment , so that a state can be perfectly distributed , despite the fact that the local ( single - system ) channels may become entanglement breaking  @xcite . in discrete variables with hilbert space dimensionality @xmath51 , </S>",
    "<S> these fixed points are the multi - dimensional werner states  @xcite ( invariant under @xmath48-twirling ) and the multi - dimensional isotropic states  @xcite ( invariant under @xmath52-twirling ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , one can consider continuous - variable werner states which are invariant under anti - correlated phase - space rotations ( non - gaussian twirlings )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all these cases are artificial since they are associated with lossless environments . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of reactivation becomes non - trivial in the presence of loss as typical for continuous variable systems in realistic gaussian environments .    in the configuration of indirect distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we can also find simple examples of reactivation with discrete variable systems ( in particular , qubits ) when the environment is lossless and @xmath49-twirling . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath42 and @xmath53 are bell pairs , e.g. , singlet states @xmath54 then suppose that qubits @xmath9 and @xmath10 are subject to twirling , which means that @xmath11 is transformed as @xmath55 where the integral is over the entire unitary group @xmath56 acting on the bi - dimensional hilbert space and @xmath57 is the haar measure . </S>",
    "<S> now the application of a bell detection on the output qubits @xmath21 and @xmath16 has the effect to cancel the environmental noise . in fact , one can easily check that the output state of @xmath24 and @xmath25 will be projected onto a singlet state up to a pauli operator , which is compensated via the communication of the bell outcome . again , the phenomenon becomes non - trivial when more realistic environments are taken into account , in particular , lossy environments as typical for continuous - variable systems .    </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we discuss here the reactivation phenomenon using continuous - variable systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the bosonic modes of the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the input modes are prepared in gaussian states with einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations  @xcite , which are the most typical form of continuous variable entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> these modes are then assumed to evolve under the action of a lossy gaussian environment . </S>",
    "<S> this type of environment is modelled by two beam splitters which mix the travelling modes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with two environmental modes , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , prepared in a bipartite gaussian state @xmath30 ( separable or entangled ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced channels , @xmath18 and @xmath58 ,  are two lossy channels whose transmissivities and thermal noises are such to make them eb channels . to achieve simple analytical results , in this manuscript we only consider the limit of large entanglement for the input states .    </S>",
