    "the ruddlesden - popper series of layered perovskites sr@xmath8ru@xmath9o@xmath10 is a fascinating research subject because the @xmath11=1 member sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 is now believed to be a spin - triplet superconductor @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11=2 member of this series sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is known to exhibit an enhanced pauli paramagnetism with a metamagnetic transition @xcite .",
    "although crystals of sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 are highly refined , the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 has not been discovered so far .",
    "recently , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2-sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 eutectic crystals were successfully grown @xcite and surprisingly , multiple superconducting transitions were observed in the ac susceptibility measurements using a sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2-region sample cut from eutectic crystals @xcite , as presented in fig .",
    "[ ec](a ) .",
    "however , it has been revealed that this superconductivity is not a bulk property of sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 because these superconducting transitions are easily suppressed by small ac magnetic fields and no anomaly was observed in the specific heat @xcite .",
    "the most plausible scenario of this superconductivity is that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 thin slabs with a few layers of ruo@xmath1 planes are embedded in the sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 region and the multiple superconducting transitions arise from the distribution of the slab thickness .    in order to obtain additional evidence for the origin of the superconductivity observed in the sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 region cut from eutectic crystals , we measured the resistivity along the @xmath4 plane ( @xmath5 ) of a sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2-region sample cut from the eutectic crystal , which we designate below as a eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample , as well as along the @xmath6 axis ( @xmath7 ) of the same sample .",
    "in addition , we measured @xmath7 of a pure ( i.e. non - eutectic ) sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample with very high quality in order to clarify whether or not pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "resistivity was measured using a conventional four - probe method with an ac current .",
    "single crystals of the sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2-sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 eutectic system and those of single - phase sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 were grown by a floating - zone method .",
    "the size of the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample was approximately 1.5 @xmath12 0.7 mm@xmath13 in the @xmath4 plane and 0.3 mm along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the results of ac susceptibility and specific heat measurements using this eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample were reported in ref .",
    "the dimensions of the pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample are 0.44 @xmath12 0.28 mm@xmath13 in the @xmath4 plane and 1.14 mm along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the @xmath5 measurements on the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample were performed down to 0.3  k with a @xmath14he cryostat ( oxford instruments , model heliox vl ) .",
    "after the @xmath5 measurements , we removed the electrical leads and attached another set of wires again on the same sample and performed @xmath15 measurements down to 0.1  k with an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( cambridge magnetic refrigeration , mfridge50 ) .",
    "the @xmath15 measurements using the pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample were performed with a @xmath14he-@xmath16he dilution refrigerator ( cryoconcept , model dr - jt - s-100 - 10 ) down to 15  mk . in this study",
    ", we used a cylinder of permalloy ( hamamatsu photonics k.k .",
    ", e989 - 28 ) in order to reduce remanent fields such as the earth field .",
    "figure [ ec](b ) shows temperature dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath15 of the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath15 are approximately 1  @xmath17 cm and 300 @xmath17 cm at 1.5  k , respectively .",
    "the in - plane resistivity is nearly the same as those of pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals with very high quality @xcite .",
    "this low value of the in - plane resistivity indicates that sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 in the eutectic system crystallized with high quality . also , macroscopic sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 domains in the eutectic system are high quality because its @xmath18 is nearly 1.5  k @xcite , which is one of the best @xmath18 of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 reported .",
    "it is interesting that both sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 spontaneously crystallize with high quality in this eutectic system .",
    "( a ) temperature dependence of the real part of the ac susceptibility for a eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample with @xmath19=0.58 @xmath20 t and @xmath21=3011 hz(sample  1 in ref .",
    "( b ) temperature dependences of the resistivity along the @xmath6 axis and that along the @xmath4 plane for the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample measured at @xmath21=89.1 hz ( @xmath22=0.5 ma - rms for @xmath5 and @xmath22=0.1 ma - rms for @xmath7 ) .",
    "( c ) a schematic image of two monolayers of ruo@xmath1 planes ( sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 ) intercalated in bilayers ( sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 ) .",
    "oxygens are located at the corner of the octahedra.,width=556 ]    in @xmath5 measurements , two clear resistance drops were observed at 1.05 and 1.32  k. these transition temperatures well coincide with those observed in the ac susceptibility [ fig .",
    "[ ec](a ) ] .",
    "however , in @xmath15 measurements , no obvious transition was observed .",
    "these results are consistent with the sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 thin - slab scenario because they imply that superconducting inclusions embedded in the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 are too thin along the @xmath6 axis to shortcircuit the current path along the interlayer direction .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast with @xmath15 for the sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3-ru eutectic system , in which the emergence of the  3-k \" superconductivity in the interface of ru lamellae results in a large drop in @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although we observed two clear transitions in the @xmath5 measurement using the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample , @xmath5 does not become zero down to low temperatures .",
    "this non - zero resistivity implies that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 inclusions in this eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample do not completely form a path between the voltage contacts .",
    "the sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 inclusions are probably well separated in this sample . in some cases , eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 samples exhibit zero resistivity ( e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , probably because sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 inclusions in such samples link a path between the voltage contacts .",
    "now , on the basis of various experiments , we believe that the origin of the superconductivity observed in the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample is the presence of several monolayers of ruo@xmath1 planes intercalated in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 as stacking faults . for example , two monolayers of ruo@xmath1 planes intercalated in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ ec](c ) .",
    "in fact , such stacked monolayers of ruo@xmath1 planes have been observed with a transmission electron microscope @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in the possibility of superconductivity in pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 . in order to examine the superconductivity in pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we consider it important ( i ) to use single crystals of single - phase sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 with very high quality , ( ii ) to cool down the sample to sufficiently low temperature , and ( iii ) to perform measurements in zero field by excluding the geomagnetic field .",
    "therefore , we measured @xmath15 down to 15  mk using a single crystal of pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 with the in - plane residual resistivity of 0.4 @xmath17 cm , which is one of the highest - quality sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 grown so far . in addition , by placing the sample in a cylinder of permalloy , we reduced the residual field to be lower than 0.1  @xmath20 t .",
    "figure  [ sp ] shows temperature dependence of @xmath15 of the pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample .",
    "the @xmath15 monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature and no anomaly indicating a superconducting transition was observed down to 15  mk . from this measurement , we conclude that pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 does not become superconducting down to 15  mk .",
    "temperature dependence of the resistivity along the @xmath6 axis of the pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample with very high quality measured at @xmath22=0.01 ma - rms with @xmath21=7 hz without the geomagnetic field .",
    "the inset shows the low - temperature region below 0.3  k.,width=336 ]",
    "we measured the resistivity along the @xmath6 axis as well as along the @xmath4 plane of a eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample .",
    "the resistance drops due to the multiple superconducting transitions were observed only for @xmath5 , but not for @xmath15 .",
    "this result indicates that superconductors with thin thickness along the @xmath6 axis are embedded in the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "now , we are convinced that the origin of the superconductivity observed in the eutectic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 sample is the presence of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 inclusions embedded in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 as stacking faults . in order to search for superconductivity in pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we also measured the resistivity along the @xmath6 axis using a single crystal of best - quality pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "however , no resistance anomaly associated with the superconducting transition was observed down to 15  mk .",
    "therefore , we conclude that pure sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 does not become superconducting down to 15  mk .",
