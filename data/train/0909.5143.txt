    "planetary nebulae ( pn ) trace one of the fastest phases of stellar evolution .",
    "they form when an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star ejects its envelope in a massive wind , leaving only the remnant degenerate c / o core . after the ejection , the star heats up rapidly , reaching temperatures over @xmath10k , within typically a few thousand years .",
    "the hydrogen burning ceases at this point , and the star quickly fades by a large factor , before entering the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "the hot star ionizes the previously ejected nebula : the bright ionized nebula combined with the very hot , optically faint star , can make the stellar emission difficult to detect .",
    "this is made worse if circumstellar extinction hides the star from direct view in the optical and ultra - violet domain .",
    "the central star of ngc  6302 has proven to be one of the most elusive of all pn central stars . in spite of many attempts ,",
    "it has not been detected so far .",
    "ngc  6302 shows a strongly bipolar morphology , with filamentary emission extending over 7@xmath11 .",
    "bipolar morphologies are thought to be associated with circumstellar discs and torii @xcite , which are commonly seen in post - agb nebulae @xcite .",
    "ngc  6302 provides an extreme case for such a massive , optically opaque torus @xcite .",
    "the central star of ngc  6302 is believed to be extremely hot , as indicated by the optical spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and observation of infrared coronal lines of highly ionized elements , of which the highest observed is si@xmath12 with an ionization potential of 303ev @xcite .",
    "to produce such high ionization species various authors have suggested very hot stars : @xcite proposed a black body of 430000 k ; @xcite @xmath13k ; and @xcite @xmath14k .",
    "@xcite , based on the observed scattered continuum , estimated the temperature of the central source to be @xmath15k .",
    "most recently , @xcite , based on 3d photo - ionization modeling , proposed a hydrogen deficient central star with a surface temperature of @xmath16k .",
    "these stellar temperatures are similar to those of ngc  7027 , another very bright , compact pn at a similar distance .",
    "but whilst the star of ngc  7027 has been unambiguously identified in images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the star of ngc  6302 has remained hidden even in previous hst and ground - based images .",
    "the only possible detection is from @xcite , who located a compact source emitting at 3.94 @xmath17 m , possibly associated with the [ si  ix ] emission line .",
    "it is not known whether the star of ngc  6302 is fundamentally different from ngc  7027 ( higher temperature or lower luminosity ) .",
    "we here present new hst observations with the newly - installed wfc3 instrument , which for the first time directly reveal the central star , and allow us to address these questions .",
    "ngc  6302 was observed as part of the hst early release observations ( ero ) to demonstrate the scientific capabilities of the newly installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the uvis channel has two 2k@xmath184k ccds , with a spatial scale of 39 mas / pixel and a field of view of 162 arcsec .",
    "imaging programme 11504 ( pi : k. noll ) was executed on 2009 july 27 using 9 orbits .",
    "table  1 lists the observations in six narrow band filters that isolate emission lines from ionization potentials of 10ev ( [ s  ii ] 6716 & 6731  ) to @xmath054ev ( he  ii 4686 ) .",
    "the pipeline - reduced long - exposure images for all the filter bands ( i.e. flt files ) were combined using _ multidrizzle _ @xcite rebinning the output to 0.040@xmath19/pixel .",
    "the images in different filters were matched using field stars in common .",
    "the alignment was verified by inspecting star positions in the final images .",
    "comparison of the multidrizzled images with those in the public ero release showed good agreement .",
    "figure 1 shows the f673n filter image of the central arcminute of ngc  6302 and the 2.4@xmath202.4@xmath19 area around the central star , for all the six hst wfc3 filter images in the ero release .",
    "this star is well detected on the f469n and f673n filters at the position @xmath21 ( j2000 ) and marginally detected on the f502n , f656n and f658n images . from the filter parameters summarized in table 1 and the emission line spectrum of ngc  6302 , as taken for example from @xcite , the only emission line contribution to the f469n filter is he  ii 4686 .",
    "the f673n filter contains weak lines of he  i and c  iv , in addition to the [ s  ii]6730  line ; the [ s  ii]6716  line is just at the half power point .",
    "all the other filters contain strong emission lines .",
    "the ease of detection of the star in the f673n filter is accounted for by the lower emission line contribution to the band , producing a much higher star / background contrast .",
    "this also applies to the f469n filter , where the he  ii line is @xmath2210% of the strength of the [ o  iii]5007  line ( in the f502n filter ) and of the h@xmath23 line in f656n .",
    "photometry was then performed on the star at the centre of ngc  6302 in the six combined multidrizzled images .",
    "robustness of the results depends on accurate determination of the high and structured background .",
    "we applied three different approaches .",
    "first , using a small aperture ( 2 pixels radius ) and a 3 pixel wide sky ( in reality nebula ) annulus .",
    "second , a surface fit to the local background , excluding a small annulus around the central star , was made in the same way for all images : this was subtracted from the image , and aperture photometry was performed on these images . as a third approach ,",
    "sextractor @xcite photometry was performed . for the f469n and f4673n filter images the results showed good consistency , but for the other images",
    "there is a larger scatter of typically @xmath240.3mag . in table 1 ,",
    "the 2.0 pixel radius photometry is listed , where an aperture correction was applied by performing photometry of uncrowded stars in the periphery of the nebula with increasing aperture size .",
    "figure 2 shows the photometric points ( in ab magnitudes ) plotted as a function of the wavelength . at the position of each point ,",

    "is a compressed log spectrum of ngc  6302 taken from @xcite , applying a logarithmic extinction at h@xmath25 of @xmath26 .",
    "a nebular continuum ( computed for @xmath27k and he / h=0.18 ) was added to this emission line spectrum and the result converted to wfc3 filter photometry using the stsdas.synphot package .",
    "this allows comparison of the stellar photometry with the colours expected from the nebula spectrum , the latter shown as red diamonds on figure 2 ( with arbitrary absolute flux scaling tied to the f656n filter measurement of the stellar magnitude ) . from this comparison",
    "it is clear that the photometric points for the f469n and f673n filters are inconsistent with nebular emission .",
    "although there appears to be a feature in the f373n , f502n , f656n and possibly f658n , filters , at the position of the star in the f469n and f673n images ( see figure 1 ) , the heavy nebula contribution prevented reliable measurement of the stellar magnitudes and the results correspond more closely to that of ( inadequately subtracted ) nebula emission .",
    "the stellar magnitude is marginally measurable on the f502n image .",
    "even though the stellar flux is higher in the f373n band , the high extinction prevents reliable detection in this filter .    taking the two photometric points at 4690 and 6766  ( table 1 ) as reliable detections of a putative central star of ngc  6302 , the ( 46906766 ) colour",
    "was compared with that of a star of a given black body temperature subjected to line - of - sight extinction . given the very high temperature estimates for the central star",
    ", a very large value of extinction must be applied to produce the observed ( 46906766 ) colour of 2.1 mag .",
    "two extinction laws were used to determine the extinction - the standard galactic law of @xcite with the ratio of total to selective extinction of @xmath28 and , on the basis of the good agreement of the observed and theoretical nebula continuum determined by @xcite , the whitford law ( as tabulated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the three estimates of the stellar temperature , using a black body . for such high temperatures , a black body should be a good approximation to the optical colours .",
    "table 2 lists the values of c determined in these three cases .",
    "the values of @xmath29 can be directly converted to @xmath30 by multiplying by 2.18 and are listed in table 2 .    for such high temperatures",
    "there is not sufficient sensitivity to determine the temperature of the central star , and the extinction only changes by 0.02 for black body temperatures from @xmath15 to @xmath31k . from the unreddened flux ,",
    "taking the f673n magnitude as the most reliable , assuming a black body , and the distance of 1.17kpc @xcite , the derived stellar luminosity can be determined and is listed in table 2 .",
    "the hst point spread function and the excellent optical and ccd quality of wfc3 uvis have allowed the central star of ngc  6302 to be unambiguously detected for the first time .",
    "the star is situated in the centre of the large - scale nebular outflows , as expected , and lies on the eastern edge of the thick dust lane .",
    "this location is also the expected one given that the eastern lobe is tilted to the foreground @xcite .",
    "however the central star is not at the expected position at the centre of the innermost torus as shown by the radio data @xcite .",
    "no optical emission counterpart was found at the position of the infrared source of @xcite , which is approximately @xmath32 north from the proposed central star . nor was a point source detected at the position of the 6 cm radio continuum emission peak reported by @xcite ( about @xmath33 from the star ) ; only an upper limit of 23.8 ( ab mag . )",
    "was measured for the f673n magnitude of a source at this position by aperture photometry .",
    "the ( 4688 - 6766 ) colour at this radio peak position resembles nebular emission .",
    "thus if a star was present at this position , it would suffer much higher extinction than indicated by the @xcite extinction maps .",
    "the very high extinction towards the central star derives mostly from the circumstellar torus . from the ratio map of h@xmath23 to radio flux , @xcite derive @xmath34 57 for the central region , corresponding to @xmath35 68 .",
    "field stars indicate a foreground extinction @xmath36 @xcite , leaving the remainder as circumstellar extinction .",
    "the br@xmath23 image of @xcite shows that the peak extinction is considerably higher than derived from h@xmath23 , possibly as high as @xmath37 : h@xmath23 can not be detected from such regions .",
    "the region of highest extinction is offset from the centre , consistent with the fact that the torus is seen with a small inclination of 18@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the distance to ngc  6302 determined by @xcite as 1.17kpc from expansion proper motions of filaments agrees fairly well with an assumed distance of 0.91kpc from @xcite and 1.0kpc from @xcite .",
    "older values include @xcite who argue for a distance of 1.7kpc , with a possible association to the star formation region ngc 6334 .",
    "distances much larger than 1kpc lead to very high masses for the shell and torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nebular luminosity , scaled to a distance of 1.17kpc , was determined as @xmath39 , based on infrared dust modeling @xcite .",
    "an almost identical value is derived from the radio flux of @xcite .",
    "both measure the reprocessed stellar radiation , and , for an optically thick nebula , the nebula luminosity should track the luminosity of the star . to derive a stellar luminosity from the photometry , a temperature and a spectrum must be assumed . for a black body",
    ", table 2 shows that the stellar and nebular luminosity agree well for a stellar temperature of around @xmath6k .",
    "many central stars of pne are expected to be binaries @xcite .",
    "the central star of ngc 6302 has also been suggested to be binary : @xcite claimed evidence for a g5v companion based on iue spectra , although this has been disputed by @xcite .",
    "a g5v star has @xmath40 , and for a distance of 1.17kpc and an extinction of @xmath41 , the observed v magnitude on the vega system would be v=22.1 . interpolating the observed magnitudes in fig .",
    "2 , the ab mag at v ( very close to the vega system ) is 21.5 , not incompatible with a g5v star .",
    "however , for a temperature of 5200k , suggested by feibelman , with an extinction of 6.7 mag , the ( 46886766 ) colour would be 1.5 mag .",
    "larger than observed .",
    "a much lower extinction ( @xmath42 ) could reproduce the ( 469673 ) colour , but the absolute v mag would be around 8.1 . corresponding to a k5 star .",
    "thus , we can exclude a g5v star .",
    "a k5v star is in principle possible , but requires a much lower extinction than measured from h@xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , a hot star precisely fits the measured extinction and is the preferred interpretation .",
    "if we were detecting the companion , the true central star would be hotter and/or less luminous than derived here ( table 2 ) .",
    "knowing an accurate luminosity and temperature allows one in principle to obtain the mass of the star , an important parameter for the stellar modeling . at this phase of evolution ,",
    "the stellar mass is close to the mass of the degenerate c / o core , or the later white dwarf .",
    "typically , this method does not provide accurate masses .",
    "the luminosity is typically too uncertain to allow for an accurate mass determination , because of distance errors . in the case of ngc 6302 ,",
    "the luminosity is accurate to 25 per cent ( based on a distance error of 12% from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the star appears to be on the cooling track where tracks of different masses are closely clustered .    instead",
    ", the evolutionary time scale can be used to improve on the mass accuracy : the speed of the evolution along the @xcite track is a very strong function of stellar mass .",
    "the surrounding nebula acts as a clock , as its expansion dates from the time the star departed the agb .",
    "this age , plus the stellar temperature and luminosity , can be used to derive an accurate stellar mass .",
    "this method is described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the age of the nebula can be derived from the angular extent , distance , and de - projected expansion velocity .",
    "the co observations of @xcite show that the torus ejection ended 2900yr ago .",
    "the bipolar lobes appear to be a little younger , with an age of 2200yr @xcite .",
    "we will assume that 2200 yr represents the full post - agb evolution age of the central star .",
    "a luminosity of 4000l@xmath4 puts the star at the upper end of the cooling track .",
    "we use interpolations of the bloecker tracks to obtain a grid of models at a mass resolution of 0.02m@xmath4 , as described by @xcite .",
    "the 0.68m@xmath4 track passes through the point at ( @xmath43k , l=4000l@xmath4 ) , however it does so at a post - agb age of 1000yr which is too young to fit ngc 6302 .",
    "higher mass tracks are hotter at this luminosity , and much younger , while lower mass stars are older and a little cooler .",
    "again , the tracks run very close in the hr diagram , leaving the age as the important discriminant .",
    "figure 3 shows the possible locations of the star ( for both extinction laws in table 2 ) , the interpolated bloecker tracks and the locus of tracks of different masses for an age of 2200 yr . the lines intersect at ( @xmath44)=(@xmath6k , @xmath7l@xmath4 ) , corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath45 .",
    "this fit gives a temperature a little below that derived by @xcite .",
    "the different extinction laws give essentially the same mass : this is because the evolution at this location in the hr diagram is very fast .",
    "it should be noted that the fit is only as accurate as the models , and there is a considerable systematic uncertainty in the derived mass @xcite .",
    "the bloecker tracks are calculated for a sparse range of masses only , so that the interpolation is done over a relatively large mass range .",
    "the speed of evolution especially of the early post - agb evolution , is uncertain , and this uncertainty feeds through to the time scales at later stages .",
    "however , the method is expected to give good constraints on relative masses .",
    "thus , comparison with the results of @xcite shows that ngc 6302 has a high mass compared to typical pne .    the result",
    "can also be compared to that of another high - mass pn , ngc  7027 .",
    "@xcite derive a mass of @xmath46m@xmath4 using the same method .",
    "the star of ngc 7027 is still on the horizontal , high luminosity track , and the nebula is much younger . for an age of 2200yr , the star of ngc  7027 will have evolved much farther down the cooling track : the interpolated bloecker tracks predict @xmath47 .",
    "the comparison therefore suggests that the star of ngc  6302 is indeed a little less massive than that of ngc  7027 .",
    "the fit to the star of ngc  6302 suggests it is currently in a phase of very fast evolution .",
    "the model track shows a decline of the luminosity of @xmath48 per cent per year . such fast evolution could leave the ionization of the nebula out of equilibrium . in summary",
    ", this paper presents the first direct detection of the central star of ngc 6302 , among the hottest stars of planetary nebulae .",
    "the photometry indicates a hot , significantly extincted star .",
    "the location in the hr diagram and age of the nebula indicates a massive star , with mass of about 0.64m@xmath4 .",
    "the models suggest that a star at this location would be in a phase of rapid fading , and it would be of interest to test this observationally .                                                            ccccccccc filter & @xmath49 & fwhm & emission & & ab & error & vega + & [  ] & [  ] & line & long & short & [ mag ] & [ mag ] & [ mag ] + f373n & 3730.2 & 39.2 & [ o ii ] & 4@xmath181400s & & 25.0 & 0.30 & 24.1 + f469n & 4688.1 & 37.2 & he ii & 4@xmath181400s & & 22.47 & 0.10 & 22.63 + f502n & 5009.6 & 57.8 & [ o iii ] & 6@xmath18370s & 1@xmath1835s & 21.6 & 0.30 & 21.7 + f656n & 6561.4 & 13.9 & h@xmath50&6@xmath18350s & 1@xmath1835s & 19.3 & 0.20 & 18.7 + f658n & 6584.0 & 23.6 & [ n ii ] & 6@xmath18370s & 1@xmath1835s & 19.0 & 0.20 & 18.6 + f673n & 6765.9 & 100.5 & [ s ii ] & 4@xmath181300s & 1@xmath18100s & 20.33 & 0.07 & 20.08 +    ccccc @xmath51 & @xmath29 & @xmath52 & f(6765 ) & @xmath53 + [ k ] & & [ mag ] & [ erg@xmath54s@xmath55 & [ l@xmath4 ] +   + 150000 & 3.05 & 6.65 & 1.84e-15 & 1280 + 220000 & 3.06 & 6.67 & 1.86e-15 & 4010 + 400000 & 3.07 & 6.69 & 1.89e-15 & 24000 +   + 150000 & 2.88 & 6.28 & 1.23e-15 & 860 + 220000 & 2.89 & 6.30 & 1.25e-15 & 2700 + 400000 & 2.90 & 6.32 & 1.27e-15 & 16100 +     field of ngc  6302 in the f673n filter ( upper image ) .",
