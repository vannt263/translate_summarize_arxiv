    "the pomeron flux factor requires no further rescaling .",
    "we shall discuss in the some detail the different @xmath12 and @xmath28 behaviours expected in the two approaches .",

    "it is convenient to parametrize these in a sudakov decomposition using two lightlike vectors directed along the beam and a spacelike transverse vector .",

    "the distinguishing feature between the two models is that in model  ii the charm contirbution is more concentrated at large @xmath12 ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : f2p1 ] and [ fig : f2p2 ] ) .",
    "our results on the quark and gluon content of the pomeron have many implications .",
    "as already mentioned , we expect that a significant fraction of hard diffractive scattering events will contain charm , and our distributions provide a way of quantifying this . especially in model  i , the overall magnitude of the gluon distribution compared to the quark distribution also predicts a large value for the pomeron s @xmath31-factor .",
    "in particular , we expect @xmath223 , in contrast to @xmath224 for the proton , which results in a similar magnitude of @xmath9 .",

    "<S> the idea that the pomeron has partonic structure similar to any other hadron has been given strong support by recent measurements of the diffractive structure function at hera . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the diffractive structure function under the assumption that the diffractive cross section can be factorized into a pomeron emission factor and the deep inelastic scattering cross section of the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to the kinematic correlations implied by this picture , and suggest the measurement of an angular correlation which should provide a first test of the whole picture . </S>",
    "<S> we also present two simple phenomenological models for the quark and gluon structure of the pomeron , which are consistent with various theoretical ideas and which give equally good fits to recent measurements by the h1 collaboration , when combined with the pomeron emission factor of donnachie and landshoff . </S>",
