    "pseudo - triangulations are opposite to the traditional planar graph embeddings - they are as non - convex as possible .    as a parallel phenomenon ,",
    "hyperbolic virtual polytopes are opposite to convex polytopes : convexity is replaced by saddle property .",
    "the two theories have a nice interaction , which is demonstrated in the paper .    even at first glance one can see that pseudo - triangulations look very much like the fans of hyperbolic virtual polytopes .",
    "indeed , in both cases we have a pointed tiling . but whereas pseudo - triangulations are planar drawings , the fans of hyperbolic virtual polytopes are spherical ones .",
    "however , the relationship is much deeper .",
    "as is shown in the paper , some items are absolutely the same , some are easily adjustable , but some are different .    in the first two sections , we sketch very briefly the two theories , omitting all details and applications and referring the reader to detailed papers from the list of references .    in the third section , we bring the two theories together .",
    "we show that for spherical embeddings , the usage of pseudo di - gons allows pointed embeddings not only for laman graphs , but also of graphs with a greater number of edges . even some laman - plus-@xmath2 graphs ( for any natural number @xmath2 ) admit a pointed embedding ( see example 3.7 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "in particular , we announce the following theorem on laman - plus - one graph embedding .",
    "it is parallel to the results of [ 7],[25 ] ( quotated also in section 1 ) .",

    "2 .   the tiles are either pseudo - triangles or pseudo - di - gons .",
    "the number of pseudo - di - gons equals 4 .",

    "1 ) * any spherical embedding of a laman - plus - one graph as a nice pseudo - tiling has exactly 4 pseudo di - gons . * if a graph admits a straightened embedding possessing the above properties 1 - 3 , then it is a laman - plus - one graph .",
    "some very natural questions on spherical pointed tilings are formulated .",
    "a simple example ( example 3.9 ) demonstrates how the methods of pseudo - triangulations work for the sake of the hyperbolic polytopes , and visa versa .    at the end of section 4",
    ", we arrange the parallel terms from both the theories in a kind of a dictionary .",
    "the correspondence of the objects is not always straightforward , but we find better to skip additional technicalities in order to stress similarity of the ideas .    * acknowledgments *    the research was inspired by talks and discussions at the ervin scrdinger institute program `` rigidity and flexibility '' ( 2006 ) organized by v. alexandrov , i. sabitov , and h. stachel .",

    "recall that the support function of a convex polytope is convex , i.e. its graph is a convex surface ( it is reasonable to consider either the spherical graph or the collection of affine graphs [ 18],[19 ] ) .    among virtual polytopes we point out the class of hyperbolic virtual polytopes .",
