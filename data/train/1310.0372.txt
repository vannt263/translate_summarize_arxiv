    "these two possible ground states in the pam are thought to describe qualitatively the observation that certain @xmath1-electron systems like ceal@xmath14 are antiferromagnetic , while others like ceal@xmath15 are not , and also to be relevant to materials in which af is lost ( and superconductivity appears ) as pressure is applied and the ratio of correlation to kinetic energies is decreased@xcite .",

    "some physics which was believed to be specific to the pam , notably the appearance of a kondo resonance in the density of states , is now known to occur in single band models as well @xcite .",
    "indeed , analytic and numerical investigations have shown that the af - singlet competition is rather generic .",
    "that is , it occurs in a variety of other two band models , not just ones in which the @xmath1-band is completely localized , @xmath16 .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward alternative to the two dimensional pam is the two band ( or two layer ) hubbard hamiltonian , in which the intralayer hopping and interaction strengths are chosen to be identical ( i.e.  @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "although there is initially a greater af tendency than in a single layer as the inter - layer hybridization , @xmath2 , grows toward @xmath19 , this is followed by a rather rapid decrease of magnetization and the eventual loss of long range order when @xmath20@xcite .",

    "one origin of the complexity is that while @xmath2 increases the rkky af tendency , it also affects the band structure in the localized @xmath1-band and hence the density of states there .",

    "is decreased to @xmath100 and in proximity to the same value of @xmath5 , longer range correlations have developed a peak while the n.n .  ones still show a dip . at this low temperature ,",
    "both correlations are of essentially equal magnitude .",
    "this is the rather generic behavior found in correspondence to crossing the metallic line ( see @xmath101 in the figure ) , which contradicts both expectations above .",
    "it is impossible to attribute this effect to the @xmath1-intralayer exchange coupling because the latter is too small and the temperature too high .",
    "instead , the correlation between the position of the peak and the metal - insulator line suggests that the change brought by @xmath5 must be related to the fact that the underlying non - interacting system develops a fermi surface .",
    "although this is beneficial to both rkky interaction and kondo screening , it is hard to reconcile our results with a scenario where the kondo effect is important since screening of the local moments should cause a rather uniform decrease of spin correlations irrespectively of the distance .",
    "therefore , in order to rationalize the drop in n.n correlations , one must first conclude that the spin - spin interaction at the metal - insulator line is weaker than in neighboring regions of the @xmath84 plane . at the same time",

    "the spectrum of excitations of the pam at half - filling displays complex features reflecting the interplay of antiferromagnetic order , the formation of a mott insulator , and the emergence of kondo singlets .",
    "the former two effects suppress the density of states at the fermi level , giving rise to a ` slater ' or ` mott ' gap respectively .",
    "the latter causes screening of the local moments in the @xmath1-band and is associated with a kondo resonance ( peak ) at the fermi level .",
    "the temperature affects these competing possibilities .",
    "for example , a kondo resonance might first form as @xmath87 is lowered , followed by a splitting of that resonance as magnetic correlations grow .",
    "in addition to these correlation effects , the spectral function is also influenced by the character of the non - interacting band structure and , in particular , by whether or not the system is metallic .",

    "it is also instructive to compare the qmc results with mean field theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : awbeta24 ] ) .",
    "we observe that at the low temperature presently considered , most of the features of the spectrum are reproduced by the mean field solution . at @xmath117 and @xmath119 , however , the mean field gap has a more pronounced dependence on @xmath2 and it is visibly larger .",
    "we attribute both differences to the fact that dqmc describes a kondo insulator , with a gap forming on top of the kondo resonance , while mean - field theory , by its very nature , describes a slater insulator and has no possibility to access the physics of kondo screening .",
    "the particular way of representing the data makes also quite clear the value of @xmath2 where one can identify the onset of band - insulating behavior : a main feature visible in each of the panels is the transition to a regime where the gap opens linearly as @xmath2 increases , and whose width is consistent with the non - interacting expressions .",
    "we found that for @xmath52 , the onset of band insulating behavior happens at roughly the same value of @xmath2 in both mean - field theory and qmc .",
    "for @xmath54 , there is a closing of the gap as the value of @xmath2 is initially increased , so that one can identify the onset of band - insulating behavior when this trend is reversed and the gap opens up as @xmath2 further increases .",
    "we found , especially clearly at @xmath120 , that the value of @xmath2 at which such mott - to - band insulator `` transition '' occurs is severely over - estimated by mean - field theory .",
    "in this paper we have used mean field theory and determinant quantum monte carlo to explore systematically the effect of @xmath1-orbital bandwidth in a two band hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "these data expand upon the more well - studied cases when @xmath9 ( the periodic anderson model ) and @xmath17 ( the hubbard bilayer ) .",
    "in addition , we have obtained data for @xmath5 of opposite sign to @xmath6 .",
    "our work quantifies the role that shifts in the overlap of localized orbitals on neighboring atoms might play in the mechanism whereby pressure destroys af correlations in heavy fermion and transition metal oxide materials .",
    "one key conclusion of our work is that magnetic correlations are maximized for small positive @xmath0 , in correspondence to where the non - interacting system becomes metallic .",
    "we found that nearest - neighbor correlations show very peculiar behavior and are , in fact , suppressed in the optimal regime for observing long - range order .",
    "we interpret this surprising behavior as a signature that the effective spin - spin interaction at the metal - insulator line is weaker than in neighboring regions , but has a longer range than for any other value of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the study of the single - particle spectral function reveals that tuning the @xmath1-bandwidth deeply modifies the low - energy spectrum of this model . in contradiction to what was found in a previous study @xcite , the coulomb interaction does not simply lead to the renormalization of the non - interacting properties .",
    "while certain of the qualitative features of the spectra can be well understood from the mean - field and non - interacting band structure , other features suggest more subtle correlation physics . in particular , at fairly high temperature",
