    "some mechanical systems display instability behavior along with the phenomena of dissipative structures and patterns formation@xcite .",
    "it has been found that this occurs as a response to extreme energy input events , and cracks formation is a good illustration for that purpose@xcite .",
    "these structures and patterns typically exhibit a branched geometry that can be characterized as a fractal , between a finite range of scales @xmath0@xcite . however , there is not yet a complete treatment in mechanics and non - equilibrium thermodynamics able to describe all this phenomenology , from the unstable dynamic until to the growth of a dissipation structure or the fractal pattern formation@xcite . from the basic assumption that there is a delay of rates and speeds between the system input and output , a principle of maximum energy dissipation",
    "was postulated and corresponding dynamic evolution equations were obtained .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by these equations , from the generated instability to the formation of structures and fractal patterns .",
    "it was observed that the delay of those speeds gives rise to the appearance of iterated equations which in turn lead to the logistic maps which describe the evolution dynamics of the system .",
    "an application to dynamic fracture was implemented and the obtained analytical results were compared with the already observed experimental instabilities in the phenomenon of fast cracking .",
    "furthermore it is concluded that the above proposed delay of velocities in the description of the instability is adequate to describe the process of energy dissipation , leading naturally to the mathematical description of fractal patterns formation , and explaining the fracture instability in high speed regime .",
    "this makes an essential and unifying step in physics of fracture towards solving a critical outstanding problem .",
    "it is known the existence of dissipation patterns in nature and particularly well on fracture of materials @xcite . over the years of research on physics of fracture",
    "it was realized that in the processes of unstable crack propagation where instability and catastrophic situations occur , structures and branched patterns are produced , which can only be described by a suitable dynamic theory involving the formation of fractals or multifractals . but",
    "a fundamental question is the following : is it possible to predict the crack patterns on fast crack growth ? in a branched crack ,",
    "the number of elemental structure , @xmath1 , with a unitary energy , @xmath2 given by the spatial density , @xmath3 , arises as a consequence of an efficient energy dissipation process searching alternatives modes of dissipation , where this number of minimal cracks is optimized by maximizing the dissipation and minimizing the energy transport @xcite . to answer that former question",
    ", one needs to consider the possibility to include together in the same theoretical framework : ( i ) the non - linear equations of a dynamical system ; ( ii ) a fundamental thermodynamical dissipation principle to describe the instability process able to generate equations that supply iterated maps which can finally represent a pattern .",
    "thus with this purpose one can use the dynamic fracture and add a modified version of the maximum dissipation principle ( medp ) proposed by slepyan to forecast the experimental results found by fineberg and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this work is based on the present absence of a non - equilibrium description for the complete phenomenological sequence , from the dynamics of instability to the growth of the dissipation structure or formation of fractal patterns . in order to contribute for filling such gap , and leading to a clarification of the involved thermodynamics , equations on maximum dissipation energy in fracture dynamics",
    "are developed .",
    "one assumes that the existence of a dissipation process with a branched pattern must be due to some non - equilibrium thermodynamic principle valid when instability conditions and the formed structure can be related .",
    "the first condition necessary is the presence of an excess of energy injected with regard to additional internal energy that the system can support .",
    "another condition is the extremization of the energy distributed by the structure of the dissipation pattern .",
    "a modified version of the slepyany s maximum dissipation principle @xcite can be proposed from the balance of excess energy , @xmath4 between the supplied energy @xmath5 and the dissipated energy as a crack growth , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the resistance to growth the crack pattern , as follow : @xmath8=\\delta\\int m(l,\\vec v)ds \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\int\\delta\\left [ \\vec g ( l_{\\phi}(t),\\vec v_{\\phi}(t)).\\vec v_{\\phi}(t ) -",
    "\\vec r_{s}(t').\\vec v_{s}(t')\\right]ds = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{(1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the curve that involves the structure generated in different steps of iteration , resulting possibly in invariant structure by scale transformation .",
    "@xmath10 is the elastodynamic energy released rate and @xmath11 are the length and the velocities of the deformations imposed to the dynamical system , and @xmath12 are the length and the velocities to form the dissipation pattern .",
    "one can admit that the decoupling between these two velocities as responsible by instability process , is given by a time delay @xmath13 between them .",
    "this time delay can be calculated by the input and the output energy of the system , in terms of ratio between the minimal characteristic crack length , @xmath14 and the maximal possible crack growth velocity , @xmath15 as : @xmath16}=characteristic \\label{(2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the limiting velocity given by rayleigh waves velocities .",
    "in addition one can define a parameter @xmath19 which is taken from griffith - irwin theory of fracture mechanics .",
    "where @xmath20 is the elastic energy released rate and @xmath21 is the crack growth resistance .",
    "considering the existence of this time delay corroborated by the experimental correlations measurements between the oscillations in the crack growth velocity and the surface profile , of approximately @xmath22 and @xmath23 for pmma and for the glass soda - lime , respectively @xcite , one can obtain from the variational calculation of the eq .",
    "( [ ( 1 ) ] ) , the following form for energy conservation principle : @xmath24 this equation relates the injected power with the dissipated power .    in the experiments performed by fineberg - gross @xcite they showed that as the crack speed reaches a critical value a strong temporal correlation between velocity , @xmath25 , and the response in the form of fracture surface at @xmath26 , takes place ( having its notation changed , in the present text , to @xmath27 instead @xmath28 to designate the fracture surface length ) . the time delay measured between these two magnitudes present a value about of @xmath29 for pmma and @xmath30 for soda - lime glass , for example , showing that there is a characteristic value for each material . by other side , sharon et .",
    "al @xcite states that , after a time of @xmath23 , the stress field is recuperated equal to the field stress of a single crack : `` thus @xmath23 after the death of a side branch of length @xmath31 , the stress field throughout the singular zone will be that a single crack '' .",
    "also washabaugh and knauss @xcite affirms that : `` the generation of micro cracks , and thus , presumably , the retardation of crack propagation may be demonstrated by generating a material with controllable cohesive strength ( a weak plane ) while maintaining all other physical properties '' .",
    "therefore one assumes that in fracture dynamics the instability appears as a consequence of a time delay between the injected energy flux @xmath32 and the dissipated energy flux @xmath33 , in the form of fracture surfaces , as the injected energy flux interacts with the dissipated energy flux @xmath33 after a time delay , given by the relaxation process in the material .    the remaining mathematical consideration of the variational principle from the eq .",

    "all theses plots show the excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results .",
    "one proposal attempts to explain the instability process on fast crack growth were made before @xcite but without any clear experimental comparison . now in this paper , a fundamental principle was introduced , which allow us to obtain the iterated equations and enabling to foresee the dissipation pattern in a complete mathematical scenario , from non - linear dynamical equations up to the fractal bifurcation map .",
    "the analysis of the bifurcation diagram given by the logistic map equation , shows that the way found by the material to dissipate the elastodynamic energy excess imposed on it during the fracture process is by generating alternative ways of energy dissipation through the mechanism of rough instabilities and bifurcations .",
    "therefore , it was shown from the results obtained with this proposed model that bifurcation process is in agreement with the assertion made by gross @xcite :    `` the bifurcation is a response to the system being driven further from equilibrium and trying to find new ways to dissipate the forcing .",
    "this means that studying the details of the pattern can lead both to an increased understanding of the bifurcation and to the system s dissipation process '' .",
    "since there are several physical systems where the bifurcation happens , this can reflect a general feature of branched phenomena in nature , where geometric patterns are generated to optimize the energy dissipation .",
    "note that the formulated medp is completely general .",
    "however , this result eq .",

    "therefore , it depends on the phenomenology , i.e. , in which case the dynamic fracture was applied .",
    "moreover , other iterated functions can be obtained from medp , as the phenomenon is generating other maps different from logistic map obtained for the case of semi - infinite griffith plate .    with the assumption of different forms of energy input @xmath102 and other hypotheses of the dynamics mechanism provided by the system for the formation of dissipation branched patterns , given by @xmath103 , the eq .",
    "( [ ( 1 ) ] ) can give rise to different bifurcation maps ; this will make the whole framework for the proposed principle much more complex than the one presented in this work .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this work is to highlight an entire phenomenological framework that is still `` untied '' and illustrating it with a known logistic map that can be very well used in the analysis of dynamic fracture .",
    "daniel m. dubois in 2006 @xcite generated and classified families of iterated functions that created maps similar to the logistic map .",
    "the study of dubois can be used to obtain results in balancing the different dynamic systems that exhibit instability and bifurcation .",
    "still notice that time delay between the input and output fluxes in the system , originated the iterated equations and that on its turn gave rise to the instability by means of bifurcation maps .",
    "since feigenbaum constant @xcite is universal and common to all of bifurcation maps , one can conclude that a universality of these maps is also associated with the universality of the principle of maximum energy dissipation . as a general principle in nature dissipation of energy",
    "should be maximum while the excess , is minimal .",
    "therefore , it is possible that other dissipation energy patterns can be predicted by this modified medp , using the same mathematical scenario .",
