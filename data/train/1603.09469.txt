    "the rapid development of three - dimensional ( 3d ) video technology , 3d visual content has become more popular nowadays .",
    "standards for coding , transmitting and storing 3d visual data have been proposed such as stereoscopic 3d video  @xcite , multiview video coding ( mvc )  @xcite , and multiview video plus depth map ( mvd ) format  @xcite . to optimize the performance of a 3d visual communication system , it is critical to develop a reliable quality assessment ( qa ) metric for 3d content . the psnr measure",
    "( or any other 2d quality metric ) does not correlate well with human visual experience of 3d visual stimuli  @xcite .",
    "since subjective evaluation is time - consuming and costly , it is desirable to design an objective qa metric that is consistent with subjective human experience .",
    "while there is a substantial amount of progress in developing 2d objective image qa indices in recent years , research on 3d image qa is still preliminary due to several reasons .",
    "the quality of a 2d image is mainly affected by errors in pixel positions and values .",
    "in contrast , perceptual quality of stereoscopic images is affected by more factors , including heterogeneous distortions and mismatch between left and right views , excessive depth perception , etc .",
    "it may result in viewing discomfort such as dizziness and eye strain .",
    "furthermore , the human visual system ( hvs ) reacts differently to asymmetrical distortions caused by different quality levels of left and right views , depending on distortion types  @xcite .",
    "another unique stereo distortion is the rendering distortion , which occurs when the 2d texture image and its depth data are transmitted simultaneously in the 3d communication system .",
    "that is , both the texture and the depth data are compressed at the encoder and transmitted to the decoder and , then , virtual views are synthesized using the depth - image - based - rendering ( dibr ) technique  @xcite",
    ". under this environment , texture errors trigger blurring or blocking artifacts in virtual views while depth map errors result in horizontal geometric misalignment since pixel values in a depth map affect the disparity of the left / right views .    in order to offer a robust stereo image quality assessment ( siqa ) method against various distortion types ,",
    "we propose a paraboost stereoscopic image quality assessment ( pbsiqa ) system in this work . by  paraboost \" , we mean the fusion of multiple image quality scorers into one in order to boost the overall performance of the quality assessment task .",
    "this fusion process is achieved by training . the methodology is also called  stacking \" in the machine learning literature .",
    "although the decision fusion methodology is generic , the design of individual scorers is highly application - dependent . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work that provides a systematic way to the design of individual scorers and applies the paraboost ( or stacking ) framework to the solution of the stereoscopic image quality assessment problem .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "related previous work is reviewed in section  [ sc : related ] .",
    "an overview of the pbsiqa system is presented in section  [ sc : overview ] .",
    "three siqa databases are introduced in section  [ sc : database ] .",
    "the pbsiqa scoring system is detailed in section  [ sc : learning_model ] .",
    "experimental results and their discussions are provided in section  [ sc : performance ] . finally , concluding remarks and future research directions are given in section  [ sc : conclusions ] .",
    "traditionally , objective image quality metrics were classified into pixel - based metrics and the human visual system ( hvs ) inspired metrics  @xcite .",
    "more recently , new quality metrics based on machine learning were proposed . here",
    ", we classify the design of a quality metric into two approaches : 1 ) the formula - based analytical approach and 2 ) the learning - based prediction approach .",
    "a quality metric of an analytical form or derived by a parametric model is constructed using the  formula - based analytical approach \" .",
    "both pixel - based metrics and the human visual system ( hvs ) inspired metrics in  @xcite belong to this class .",
    "a quality metric derived by a machine learning process ( e.g. , mmf in @xcite is obtained using the  learning - based prediction approach \" .    by following the first approach ,",
    "2d metrics were extended to 3d metrics by combining distortions of a depth map and images of both views linearly in @xcite .",
    "the correlation between existing 2d metrics and the perceived quality of a stereo pair obtained by direct decoding or dibr was investigated by hanhart _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "another idea is to extract features that influence human visual experience and combine them to derive a metric .",
    "for example , by assuming that the perceived distortion and the depth of stereoscopic images highly depend on local features such as edges and planar parts , sazzad _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a siqa metric for jpeg compressed images using segmented local features .",
    "some formula - based metrics exploit hvs characteristics .",
    "gorley and holliman  @xcite proposed a metric based on the sensitivity of hvs to contrast and luminance changes .",
    "maalou and larab  @xcite proposed a metric by exploiting the color disparity tensor and the contrast sensitivity function .",
    "hewage and martini  @xcite presented a reduced - reference quality metric based on edge detection in the depth map and demonstrated a good approximation for the full - reference quality metric .",
    "recently , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a methodology for subjective 3d qoe assessment experiments using external stimuli such as vibration , flickering and sound .",
    "others use binocular perception models .",
    "stelmach and meegan @xcite reported that binocular perception is dominated by the higher quality image in face of low - pass filtering operations yet by the average of both images for quantized distortions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observed that the perceived quality of a jpeg - coded stereo image pair is close to the average quality of two individual views .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an extended version of the ssim index based on a binocular model .",
    "this metric uses a fixed set of parameters , but it is not adaptive to asymmetric distortions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of structural distortion parameter ( sdp ) , which varies according to distortion types , and employed the sdp as a control parameter in a binocular perception model to provide robust qa results for both symmetric and asymmetric distortions .",
    "more recently , feng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an siqa method by considering the binocular combination property and the binocular just noticeable difference model .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a no - reference quality metric by considering perceptual blurriness and blockiness scores and taking visual saliency into account .",
    "the second approach has been used to derive 2d and 3d image qa metrics , and it becomes more and more popular in recent years .",
    "the multi - metric fusion ( mmf ) method proposed by liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite offers a good example for 2d learning - based image qa , among many others . as to learning - based siqa metrics ,",
    "the number is much less since the size of stereoscopic image quality databases is relatively small .",
    "two examples are given .",
    "park  _ et al_.  @xcite used a set of geometric stereo features for anaglyph images and built a regression model to capture the relationship between these features and the quality of stereo images .",
    "cheng and sumei  @xcite extracted a set of basis images using independent component analysis and used a binary - tree support vector machine ( svm ) to predict scores of distorted stereo images .",
    "in this work , we adopt the second approach in the design of a siqa system , which is built upon the parallel boosting ( paraboost ) idea .",
    "the proposed pbsiqa system consists of two stages . at stage",
    "i , multiple learning - based scorers are designed , where each scorer handles a specific type of distortion such as the blocking artifact , blurring distortion , additive noise , and so on .",
    "the output of these scorers are a normilized objective score that has a value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the output of these scorers is an obejctive score that only considers the target distortion . at stage ii",
    ", the fuser takes scores from all individual scorers to yield the final quality score . the prediction model in the fuser is also obtained from a learning process .",
    "the availability of multiple scorers at stage i enables us to handle complex factors that influence human perceptual quality systematically . in particular , we will investigate the impacts of various distortions in texture and depth maps on the quality of rendered images and , then , take them into account in the design of participating scorers .",
    "the design of the pbsiqa system will be detailed in section [ sc : learning_model ] .",
    "furthermore , we will show the superiority and the robustness of the proposed pbsiqa system by extensive experimental results over several databases consisting of the 2d - plus - depth format as well as the traditional stereoscopic format with symmetric and asymmetric distortions in section [ sc : performance ] . along this line",
    ", we compare the performance of the proposed pbsiqa system against 17 other 2d/3d quality indices .",
    "0.15     0.15     0.15     0.2     0.2      +    1.5 in     1.5 in     1.5 in     1.5 in     the 2d - plus - depth format is adopted in the 3dvc standard due to its several advantages .",
    "for example , it allows the texture image and its corresponding depth map image at a few sampled viewpoints to be compressed and transmitted in a visual communication system . after decoding them at a receiver side",
    ", we can render several intermediate views between any two input views using depth image based rendering ( dibr ) technique . however , very few 3d image quality database was built based on the 2d - plus - depth format .",
    "this is one of the main motivations in constructing the mcl-3d database  @xcite .",
    "the mcl-3d database is designed to investigate the impact of texture and/or depth map distortions on the perceived quality of the rendered image so as to develop a robust stereoscopic image quality metric .",
    "first , we carefully chose nine texture images and their associated depth maps from a set of 3dvc test seqeunces as references .    to capture the content variety ,",
    "the spatial information ( si ) defined by itu - t recommendation  @xcite for each texture image and its depth map was calculated .",
    "also , images were carefully extracted from an interval with slow motion to avoid motion blur .",
    "this reference set contains indoor / outdoor scenes , cg images , different depth perception , and so on . in fig .",
    "[ fig : referenceimage ] , only texture images are shown .",
    "[ fig : distortion_design ] shows the distortion design .",
    "there are three original views and each view consists of a texture image and its associated depth map ( denoted by @xmath0/@xmath1 , @xmath2/@xmath3 , and @xmath4/@xmath5 ) .",
    "distortions with different types and levels were applied to original images and/or depth maps .",
    "then , distorted texture images and depth maps were input to the view synthesis reference software ( vsrs 3.5 @xcite ) along with the configuration file provided by the production group to render two intermediate views , @xmath6 and @xmath7 that an assessor will view in the subjective test .",
    "we applied _ six _ different distortions with _ four _ different levels to three input views symmetrically : guassian blur , sampling blur , jpeg compression , jpeg-2000 compression , additive noise , and transmission error .",
    "based on the recommendations of itu @xcite , we consider five quality levels in subjective tests . the original reference stereoscopic images have excellent quality while the other 4-level distorted images were controlled by parameters associated with different distortion types .",
    "the mcl-3d database consists of the following three sub - databases .",
    "* dataset a contains texture distortions only . *",
    "dataset b contains depth map distortions only . *",
    "dataset c contains both texture and depth map distortions .",
    "the above design allows us to investigate the effect of texture distortions and depth map distortions independently .",
    "the test was performed in a controlled environment as recommended by itu  @xcite , including the display equipment , viewing distance , ambient light , etc .",
    "we performed pre - screening of subjects and conducted a training session before the actual test .",
    "the subjective test results were verified by a screening process according to annex 2 of recommendation bt.500  @xcite , and outliers were removed .",
    "a pairwise comparison was adopted and the comparison result was converted to the mean opinion score ( mos ) .",
    "the mcl-3d database can be downloaded from @xcite . for further details ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in our earlier work  @xcite",
    ", we also constructed two new databases by expanding the ivc @xcite and the live @xcite databases and call them ivc - a and live - a , respectively .",
    "we took 12 stereoscopic image pairs from ivc and live as references . while the distortions in ivc and live are symmetric , we add asymmetric distortions in ivc - a and live - a .",
    "that is , we add distortions of different levels but the same type to the left and right views of a stereo image pair .",
    "there are four distortion types .",
    "each stereoscopic image pair has six combinations of distortion levels : three symmetric distortion levels ( @xmath8 , [ 2,2 ] , [ 3,3]$ ] ) and three asymmetric distortion levels ( @xmath9 , [ 1,3 ] , [ 2,3]$ ] ) .",
    "we conducted a subjective test to obtain mos using the absolute category rating ( acr ) @xcite .",
    "a summary of the three siqa databases used in our test is given in table [ tab : sum_mcldata ] .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : performance2 ]    > m2cm|>m1.5cm > m1.5cm > m1.5 cm * database * & * pcc * & * srocc * & * rmse * + ivc - a & 0.884 & 0.853 & 0.404 + live - a & 0.893 & 0.844 & 0.433 +    [ tab : performance3 ]    next , we show the performance comparison over ivc - a and live - a databases in table  [ tab : performance2 ] .",
    "we only fuse scorers # 1@xmath10#7 for texture distortions in the pbsiqa system since these two databases consist of the stereoscopic data format ( i.e. , the left and the right views without the depth map ) . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : performance2 ] , pbsiqa still outperforms existing metrics significantly .",
    "for example , the pcc values of pbsiqa for ivc - a and live - a are 0.952 and 0.924 , respectively while those of the second best metric ( rsk ) are 0.884 and 0.841 . we see that the pcc values of pbsiqa for these two databases are higher than that for mcl-3d .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distortion types in ivc - a and live - a are simpler than that of mcl-3d so that each scorer can generate more reliable scores for them .    practically , it is not convenient to train learning - based quality assessment indices to tailor to a new database every time .",
    "it is desirable to develop a quality metric that offers consistent performance when it is trained by one database yet tested by a different database .",
    "this is called cross - database validation . to conduct this task , we train the pbsiqa system using the mcl-3d database and then use it to predict the quality score of stereoscopic images in ivc - a and live - a .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : performance3 ] .",
    "although its performance degrades slightly , the pbsiqa system still offers good results .",
    "as the siqa database size becomes larger , its prediction accuracy goes higher .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to point out that , since the pbsiqa system consists of multiple individual scorers , its complexity is roughly equal to the total complexity of all contributing scorers . basically , it trades higher complexity for better performance .",
    "in this work , we proposed a paraboost method to design a new stereoscopic image quality assessment system called pbsiqa , which includes a set of parallel quality scorers designed to address various distortions in stage i and their scores are fused to yield the ultimate quality score in stage ii .",
    "the excellent performance of the pbsiqa system was collaborated by extensive experimental results .",
    "our research has an impact to the 3d content delivery field since a reliable 3d quality assessment metric serves as a valuable objective function in optimizing the overall system performance .    as future extensions , it is interesting to incorporate the masking effect .",
    "for example , distortions in salient regions such as foreground objects have more negative impacts on perceptual quality . also , textured regions are usually more robust to distortions , whereas distortions in homogeneous regions are more noticeable .",
    "we may further improve performance by considering content characteristics .",
    "another interesting extension is to consider the quality assessment of 3d video . on one hand , we believe that the paraboost methodology can be extended to the case of 3d video in principle . on the other hand",
    ", we do need sufficiently large 3d video quality assessment databases for the learning - based methodology to apply .",
    "the lack of publicly accessible 3d video quality assessment databases is the main barrier to this research and it is desired to develop such databases for the research community .",
