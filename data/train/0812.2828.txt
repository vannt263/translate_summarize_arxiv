    "a starburst galaxy is characterized by strong star forming activity .",
    "starburst phenomena usually occur in the central regions of galaxies , and produce large numbers of massive stars on short time scales with star formation rates tens or hundreds of times higher than those in normal galaxies . through stellar winds and energetic supernova explosions ,",
    "these massive stars generate a large amount of mechanical energy that can sweep the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) from starburst regions , create ism bubbles , and generate high velocity galactic winds .",
    "this hypothetical starburst evolution is supported by several numerical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is actually based on various observational results .",
    "shell - like structures and outflows have been observed in many starburst galaxies in optical emission lines and soft x - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "shell - like structures are also often observed in nearby galaxies in the atomic hydrogen ( h ) line ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for these shell - like or outflowing features from starburst galaxies are , however , rarely seen using molecular tracers .",
    "the famous cases are the molecular outflows in m82 @xcite and ngc 891 @xcite , and molecular bubbles in ngc 3628 @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the rarity of such detections are mostly their diffuse and extended nature and the lack of sensitive detections in this wavelength range .",
    "recent improvements of various instruments at millimeter - wave have resulted in progress in this field : the interferometric o(1 - 0 ) observations toward m82 succeeded in imaging molecular superbubbles and outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and revealed a self - induced starburst mechanism @xcite .",
    "molecular superbubbles and/or outflows have also been detected in ngc 253 @xcite , ngc 4631 @xcite , and ngc 4666 @xcite .",
    "since stars form from molecular gas , observing these peculiar features in molecular gas can provide information about the regulation and feedback processes of the starburst phenomena . here",
    "we report a new example of molecular superbubbles and outflows from the starburst galaxy ngc 2146 .",
    "ngc 2146 is a nearby ( 17.2 mpc , 1@xmath12 = 80 pc ; @xcite ) , ir luminous ( @xmath13  l@xmath14 ; @xcite ) , edge - on ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) starburst galaxy .",
    "its optical appearance shows disturbed features with peculiar spiral arms , which can not be explained by a simple model of spiral structure @xcite .",
    "the neutral hydrogen images display 100  kpc scale tidal tails , although there is no evidence of a nearby companion galaxy @xcite .",
    "a large amount of molecular gas is concentrated around the central region , which is enough to support the starburst activities @xcite .",
    "the central region hosts several compact radio continuum sources , identified as supernova remnants , radio supernovae , and ultra - compact and/or ultra - dense h regions @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray images show kpc - scale outflows from the starburst region around the galactic center @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics are reminiscent of those present in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 , where kpc - scale outflows have also been detected , together with a molecular superbubble .",
    "given the similarity between the two galaxies , it is natural to expect that similar features can be revealed also in ngc 2146 .",
    "therefore , we have performed deep observations in the o(1 - 0 ) line toward the central region of ngc 2146 as a case study for molecular superbubbles and outflows .",
    "we performed deep o(1 - 0 ) observations toward the central @xmath2 region of the edge - on starburst galaxy ngc 2146 with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) , which consists of six 10-meter antennas located at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) .",
    "the observations were made during 2001 november to 2002 april with three configurations .",
    "the total on - source time is @xmath1644 hours .",
    "the phase tracking center of our observation is @xmath17(j2000 ) = , @xmath18(j2000 ) = .",
    "we used tunerless sis receivers @xcite , and observed the o(1 - 0 ) line in the upper side band .",
    "double side band system temperature was about 200  300  k for most of the observations .",
    "the backend used was the xf - type spectro - correlator ultra wide band correlator ( uwbc ; @xcite ) , configured to have 512  mhz bandwidth with 256 channels ( i.e. , a 2  mhz channel width or 5.2  km  s@xmath1 velocity resolution ) .",
    "we observed 3c279 as a bandpass calibrator , and 0633 + 734 as an amplitude and phase calibrator .",
    "the flux scale of 0633 + 734 was determined by comparisons with mars , uranus , and neptune , and the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is estimated to be @xmath19 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the nro software package `` uvproc ii '' @xcite , and were cleaned using standard procedures implemented in the nrao software _ aips_. the maps were made with natural weighting , with a final synthesized beam size of @xmath20 ( 280  pc @xmath21 230  pc ) and a position angle of @xmath22 .",
    "the noise level of the full spectral resolution maps ( 5.2  km  s@xmath1 ) is 11.4  mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "the noise level of the 20.8  km  s@xmath1 resolution channel maps in figure  [ ch0112 ] is 5.7  mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "in figure  [ m0m1 ] , we present the o(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity ( moment 0 , figure  [ m0m1]a ) and the intensity - weighted mean velocity field ( moment 1 , figure  [ m0m1]b ) maps of the central region of ngc 2146 . most of the co emission is concentrated along the galactic disk with the inner co intensity peaks of the image roughly following the major axis , but with the outer regions of the galactic disk clearly tilted counter - clockwise from the major axis .",
    "these features are consistent with previous interferometric o(1 - 0 ) observations @xcite .",
    "the velocity field ( figure  [ m0m1]b ) shows that the overall velocity contours are roughly symmetric , although here , as well , a tilt is present at the outer part of the galactic disk .",
    "the position angle of this galaxy , derived from its kinematics ( i.e. , from the velocity field ) , is 137@xmath23 ( an angle of 0@xmath23 corresponds to north , increasing counterclockwise ) .",
    "this value is consistent with that derived from past co observations ( 135@xmath23 ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ ch0112 ] shows the o(1 - 0 ) channel maps of the same region with a velocity resolution of 20.8  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the overall molecular gas features along the galactic disk ( p.a .  of @xmath24 ) are similar to those often seen in galaxies with flat - rotation curves .",
    "in addition , there are some diffuse structures outside the galactic disk .",
    "the position - velocity ( @xmath25 ) diagram taken along the major axis ( figure  [ pv_aspx ] ) can be fitted in the central region of the galactic disk by two rigid body rotation curves .",
    "the rigid body rotation curve between @xmath26 and @xmath27 shows a steeper gradient than that between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since the former structure is located closer to the nucleus of the galaxy , hereafter we refer to it as the `` nuclear disk '' , while the latter is referred to as the `` inner disk '' .",
    "the region outside the inner disk ( hereafter called the `` outer disk '' ) shows flat rotation .    the total co flux density detected in figure  [ m0m1]a is measured as @xmath30  jy  km  s@xmath1 (= 110  k  km  s@xmath1 ) . the co luminosity over a @xmath31  pc@xmath32 area is then calculated as @xmath33  k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath32 .",
    "the co luminosities observed with the iram 30  m single dish telescope and the plateau de bure interferometer are @xmath34  k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath32 over @xmath31  pc@xmath32 area and @xmath35  k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath32 over @xmath36  pc@xmath32 area , respectively ( with their values re - scaled because of the different distance for ngc 2146 adopted by us ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we allow for a calibration error of 10% in our data , our co luminosity is comparable with the single dish luminosity reported in @xcite , indicating that our observations recovered all the co flux , and hence , are not affected by the missing flux problem .",
    "in addition to the bright features seen in the galactic disk region , we also detected diffuse and extended structures above and below the galactic disk .",
    "these features are labelled _",
    "of1 _ and _ sb1 _ in figure  [ m0m1]a . in figure",
    "[ m0m1]b , these regions show velocity structures more disturbed than the disk region , and obvious deviation from symmetric velocity contours can be easily seen .",
    "figure  [ ab ] is a @xmath25 diagram along the minor axis after the molecular gas data have been integrated along the major axis ( see figure  [ m0rot43 ] for the range over which the integration has been performed ) .",
    "the @xmath25 diagram shows that most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the central `` vertical '' region at the position of zero arcsec , which corresponds to the galactic disk",
    ". outside of the disk , however , the two diffuse and extended structures , _ sb1 _ and _ of1 _ are also evident . the arc _",
    "sb1 _ shows a half shell - like structure encompassing a cavity , which corresponds to the _ sb1 _ in figure  [ m0m1]a . a similar half shell - like molecular structure seen in the @xmath25 diagrams of m82",
    "has be been explained in terms of an expanding bubble @xcite .",
    "comparable behavior has often been reported in expanding h superbubbles @xcite .",
    "the similarities between the distribution and kinematics of _",
    "sb1 _ and those of the expanding bubbles reported in literature lead us to conclude that _",
    "sb1 _ is indeed an expanding molecular superbubble . from the integrated intensity map ( figure  [ m0m1]a ) and the major - axis - integrated @xmath25 diagram ( figure  [ ab ] )",
    ", we can estimate the radius of _",
    "sb1 _ to be @xmath37 , which corresponds to @xmath38  pc at a distance of 17.2 mpc .",
    "the range of the radius depends on where we assume the center of the bubble is located ; the minimum radius corresponds to the edge of the disk , and the maximum the center of the disk .",
    "the expansion velocity can also be measured from the @xmath25 diagram .",
    "we assume that the superbubble expansion is traced by the intensity peaks marked by the red dashed line of figure  [ ab ] . in this case , the measured expansion velocity is @xmath39  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "following the arrow overlapped to the extended region _ of1 _",
    "( seen as an arc in figure  [ m0m1]a ) , a velocity gradient is seen .",
    "similar features with linear increasing velocity are often seen in outflows from young stellar objects in star forming regions in our galaxy . because of the location , structure , and kinematics of the arc _",
    "of1 _ , we conclude that _",
    "of1 _ is most likely an outflow .",
    "this linear feature in figure  [ ab ] extends from the center of the galaxy to a position @xmath40 distant from it , hinting at an extension of the outflow from the galactic center of @xmath7  kpc . near the galactic disk , both blueshifted and redshifted components can be seen ( within @xmath41  km  s@xmath1 , between two red solid lines in the right side of figure  [ ab ] ) .",
    "the outflow velocity is increasing linearly from v@xmath42 of @xmath43  km  s@xmath1 to @xmath44  km  s@xmath1 .    from _",
    "sb1 _ in figure  [ m0m1]b , a diffuse linear structure with a very small velocity gradient is pointing toward the south .",
    "this structure can also be clearly seen in the channel maps ( figure  [ ch0112 ] ) at a velocity range between 829.8  km  s@xmath1 and 850.6  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this component matches with the co clumps reported in @xcite , and is probably associated with a dust lane or `` dust finger '' stretching southwest from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "together with the two aforementioned diffuse structures , which are obvious in the integrated intensity map and the @xmath25 diagram , there is another bubble - like structure detected around the galactic disk region .",
    "the molecular gas in normal circular galactic rotation would be concentrated along a rigid- or flat - rotation curve .",
    "gas not exhibiting this behavior can be considered as gas rotating under non - circular motion or moving under different mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ pv12chmaj ] shows the @xmath25 diagrams along the major axis with different offsets .",
    "most of the molecular gas is indeed concentrated along the rigid- or flat - rotation curves , but some diffuse structures can be seen away from these curves .",
    "all of the diffuse structures appear only to the west of the galactic center with its offset between @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the nucleus ( the vertical dashed lines in figure  [ pv12chmaj ] ) . since non - circular motion , such as gas along a bar , generally has a symmetric structure , we think that these structures in ngc 2146 may be produced by another mechanism . therefore , we averaged the @xmath25 diagram between @xmath47 and @xmath48 offset from the major axis ( figure  [ sb2majmin ] ) .",
    "the outcome clearly shows a diffuse shell - like structure , indicated by the red dashed curve labelled _",
    "sb2 _ in figure  [ sb2majmin ] , only at the western side of the galactic center .",
    "hence , this feature in the @xmath25 diagram can be explained with in expanding molecular superbubble such as that in _ sb1 _ mentioned above",
    ".    a close look at this superbubble shows two inner cavities , indicated by red plus symbols in figure  [ sb2majmin ] .",
    "the velocities associated with _",
    "p1 _ and _ p2 _ are + 20  km  s@xmath1 and -5  km  s@xmath1 relative to the systemic velocity , respectively .",
    "the diffuse structures around _",
    "p1 _ can be also seen in the @xmath25 diagrams ( figure  [ pv12chmaj ] ) from the positions @xmath45 to @xmath49 offset from the major axis , and those around _",
    "p2 _ appear from @xmath45 to @xmath50 relative to the major axis .",
    "furthermore , most of the @xmath25 diagrams in figure  [ pv12chmaj ] show that the molecular gas avoids the positions _",
    "p1 _ and _ p2 _ , resulting in shell - like structures . from these figures",
    ", we can infer two independent superbubbles at _ p1 _ and _ p2_. however , the signal - to - noise ratio difference between these two cavities is small , only about @xmath51 difference , and therefore it is more natural to consider these structures to be created by the same explosion event . in this case , the structure dividing _",
    "p1 _ and _ p2 _ is just a detail feature of one molecular bubble or possibly just noise in our data .",
    "in addition , the positions of _ p1 _ and _ p2 _ lie away from the rigid- or flat - rotation part where most of the molecular gas resides , and hence , we consider the possibility that the molecular bubbles originate from these points to be less likely .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will consider _ sb2 _ as one superbubble , which is @xmath16 10@xmath12 offset from the galactic center ( figure  [ sb2majmin ] ) .    from figures  [ m0rot43 ] , [ pv12chmaj ] , and [ sb2majmin ] , we can estimate the main characteristics of _ sb2 _ : its radius is estimated to be @xmath52 ( @xmath53  pc ) , and the expansion velocity is measured as @xmath54  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the range of the radius depends again on where we assume the center of the bubble to lie ; the minimum radius corresponds to the edge of the disk , and the maximum to the plane of the disk , respectively .",
    "in the previous section , we have reported convincing arguments in favor of the presence in ngc 2146 of two molecular bubbles and an outflow derived using the integrated intensity maps and the @xmath25 diagrams . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on a search for bubbles and/or outflows within the galactic disk of ngc 2146 using a ` model subtraction ' method .",
    "the model we have used can be described as follows : we first use the _ aips _ task _ iring _ to compute mean intensity within a range of azimuthal angles per a certain radius range of a ring to obtain the velocity information .",
    "we calculate the mean intensity within 10@xmath23 of the major axis for each redshifted and blueshifted velocity range ( see figure  [ m0rot43 ] ) .",
    "we then fit the @xmath25 diagram along the major axis with an elmegreen curve @xcite , parametrized as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rotational velocity in units of km  s@xmath1 , @xmath57 is the galactocentric radius in units of kpc , and the variables @xmath17 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the free parameters . figure  [ elm_fit ] shows the data and the fit , and the results of the fit are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .    to characterize the galactic kinematics of the central region of ngc 2146 , we compare the observed kinematics with the large - scale galactic rotation . figure  [ elm]a presents the @xmath25 diagram along the major axis overplotted with the fitted rotation curve ( from figure  [ elm_fit ] ) .",
    "we have further modeled the velocity map from the fitted rotation curve under the assumption that the galactic disk is axisymmetric with an inclination angle of 63@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ elm]b shows this modeled velocity map overlaid with the observed velocity map . an excellent agreement between these two maps is seen .",
    "we then subtract the modeled velocity map from our nma velocity map , and show the resultant residual velocity map in figure  [ elm]c and the residual velocity along the major axis in figure  [ elm]d .",
    "the residual velocities along the major axis are , on average , less than @xmath635  km  s@xmath1 ( comparable to our velocity resolution ) with maximum residual velocities of only @xmath6310  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the residual velocities over the entire galactic disk region are never larger than about @xmath6320  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "there are some systematic residual velocities around @xmath64 from the center with a negative residual velocity around the position of @xmath27 , and positive residual velocity around the position of @xmath26 .",
    "since these regions correspond to those where there are two rigid - rotation components ( see figure  [ pv_aspx ] ) , a simple elmegreen rotation curve does not constitute an optimal fit .",
    "these systematic residual velocities are therefore an artificial effect , and should not be considered as an outflow feature . from these results ,",
    "we have concluded that the galactic kinematics within a few kpc of the central region of ngc 2146 can be described by normal galactic rotation .",
    "we find no evidence of outflows with velocities greater than 20  km  s@xmath1 in the galactic disk .",
    "note that our model subtraction method does not detect any evidence of _",
    "this is because our method uses an intensity - weighted mean velocity field map , and therefore diffuse and weak components , such as _ sb2 _ , can not be detected .",
    "h absorption line observations have revealed that the central region of ngc 2146 is undisturbed and smooth , and can be interpreted as a rotating disk @xcite , which is consistent with our results .",
    "the overall co distributions in our channel maps are similar to those shown in @xcite .",
    "some of the structures in the channel maps have been interpreted by @xcite as outflow features ( thick solid lines in their figures 6 and 8c ) .",
    "our velocity model fitting indicates that those structures may be explained instead by normal galactic rotation .",
    "in this section , we calculate the timescales , masses , and energies of the molecular superbubbles and the outflow present in ngc 2146 .",
    "the molecular and total gas masses , in unit of m@xmath14 , can be calculated as @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the distance in units of mpc , @xmath68 is the co integrated intensity in units of jy  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath69 is the co - to - h@xmath70 conversion factor in units of @xmath11  ( k  km  s@xmath1)@xmath1 , and the factor 1.36 is to account for the presence of elements other than hydrogen @xcite . in the following calculations , we assumed the @xmath69 to be @xmath71  @xmath11  ( k  km  s@xmath1)@xmath1 , which is the same value as that used for the molecular gas mass calculations in m82 @xcite with which ngc 2146 shares a number of similarities ( see section  [ sect - intro ] ) .",
    "we also assume that the energy of one supernova explosion is @xmath72  erg @xcite .",
    "all the derived values are summarized in table  [ tabbubl ] .",
    "note that the total gas mass derived from our observation ( with @xmath73  jy  km  s@xmath1 ; see section  [ sect - overall ] ) is @xmath74  m@xmath75 .",
    "first , we discuss the molecular superbubble _ sb1 _ , which is shown in figure  [ m0m1 ] and [ ab ] .",
    "if we assume that the expansion velocity stayed constant since the beginning of the superbubble s expansion , we can derive its dynamical timescale , @xmath76 . using the radius of @xmath38  pc and the expansion velocity of @xmath77  km  s@xmath1",
    ", we obtain the timescale @xmath78 the integrated intensity of _",
    "sb1 _ is 115  jy  km  s@xmath1 , so from equations  ( [ eq_mh2 ] ) and ( [ eq_gas ] ) , the gas mass of _",
    "sb1 _ is calculated to be @xmath79  m@xmath14 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the superbubble , @xmath80 , is therefore estimated to be @xmath81 considering that @xmath1610  20 % of the energy transmits from supernova explosions into the surrounding ism @xcite , 20,500  93,000 supernova explosions are required to account for the energy of _",
    "sb1_.    second , we estimate the properties of the molecular superbubble _ sb2 _ , which is shown in figures  [ m0rot43 ] , [ pv12chmaj ] , and [ sb2majmin ] .",
    "again , with the same assumption of constant expansion velocity and using the radius of @xmath82  pc ( see section  [ sect - small ] ) , we can derive the timescale , @xmath83 the integrated intensity of _",
    "sb2 _ measured from the @xmath25 diagram is 17.3  jy  km  s@xmath1 , so that the mass of _ sb2 _ is calculated as @xmath84  m@xmath75 . in this case , the energy of the bubble , @xmath85 , is estimated as @xmath86 . after applying the efficiency of 10  20% , the energy corresponds to 1,200  7,900 supernova explosions .    the size , expansion timescales and velocities are similar for both superbubbles , but the mass and therefore the energy derived for",
    "_ sb1 _ are about an order of magnitude larger than for _ sb2_. these results may suggest that _",
    "sb1 _ is related to a more active ( energetic ) starburst than that related to _",
    "sb2_.      since the @xmath25 diagram shows a linear increase in velocity as a function of the distance from the galactic disk for this molecular outflow _",
    "( see section  [ sect - large ] ) , it is natural to assume that _",
    "of1 _ is experiencing a constant acceleration . using a size and a terminal velocity for the outflow of 2  kpc and 200  km  s@xmath1 , respectively , the acceleration , @xmath87 , and the timescale , @xmath88 , of the outflow can be calculated as @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . on the other hand , it is also possible to assume that the initial expansion velocity of the outflowing gas is different in each gas cloud .",
    "therefore faster ( slower ) gas is located far from ( close to ) the galactic disk , resulting in the linear increase in velocity as a function of the distance from the galactic disk in the @xmath25 diagram . in this case , the timescale of _ of1 _ can be estimated from the furthest distance of _",
    "of1 _ and its velocity as , @xmath92 .",
    "both assumptions lead to the similar timescales .",
    "the integrated intensity of _",
    "of1 _ is estimated to be 150  jy  km  s@xmath1 , leading to a total mass for the outflow of @xmath93 m@xmath75 ( see equations  [ eq_mh2 ] and [ eq_gas ] ) .",
    "according to the kinematics described above , the molecular outflow velocity is not constant like in the case of the two molecular bubbles _",
    "sb1 _ and _ sb2_. hence , the outflow energy , @xmath94 has to be calculated from each channel map according to the relation @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the molecular gas mass and the velocity of _",
    "of1 _ at each channel _ i_. the energy is calculated as @xmath98 .",
    "after applying the efficiency of 10  20% , it corresponds to 150,000  300,000 supernova explosions .",
    "ngc 2146 has a kpc - scale outflow from the galactic center detected at soft x - ray wavelengths @xcite . here , we compare our o(1 - 0 ) map with the soft x - ray image obtained with the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "figure  [ xray ] shows the o(1 - 0 ) integrated - intensity contour map overlaid on the soft x - ray image .",
    "the soft x - ray image shows strong extended emission toward the northeastern part of the galaxy , and weak extended emission in the southwest . between these two diffuse emission regions",
    ", there is almost no emission except for a number of strong point sources .",
    "the latter location corresponds to the strong co emitting region , namely the galactic disk region , and therefore the lack of diffuse soft x - ray emission can be explained by absorption from the molecular gas in the galactic disk . because the stronger x - ray emission appears in the northeastern region of the galactic disk rather than in the southwestern region ,",
    "the most probable picture is that the southwestern edge of the co emission is at the near side of the galactic disk and the northeastern one is at the far side .",
    "this scenario is indeed consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "since the soft x - ray image traces the location of hot thermal plasma in this galaxy @xcite , the comparison between our o(1 - 0 ) map and the soft x - ray map gives the schematic image of the relative location between the molecular gas and the hot plasma . in figure",
    "[ xray ] , the northeastern x - ray emission shows a conical structure , emanating from the center of the galaxy and spreading outwards , perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy ( color - scale features enclosed by two red shorter dashed lines ) . the molecular outflow , _ of1 _ ,",
    "is located around the front edge of the x - ray outflow .",
    "this fact and the good spatial correspondence suggest that these two outflows are physically connected .",
    "we then compared the molecular gas outflow energy with that of the soft x - ray outflow .",
    "as reported in section  [ sect - of ] ( and in table  [ tabbubl ] ) , the energy of _",
    "of1 _ is calculated as @xmath99  erg . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of the thermal plasma outflow is estimated as @xmath100  erg ( with their value re - scaled because of the different distance for ngc 2146 adopted by us ; @xcite ) , where @xmath101 is the volume filling factor for the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "if we adopt the standard value of 0.01  0.1 for @xmath101 @xcite , the thermal plasma outflow energy can be calculated as @xmath102  erg .",
    "the energy of the thermal plasma outflow is therefore comparable or an order of magnitude larger than the molecular outflow energy , depending on the volume filling factor for the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the thermal plasma would therefore have enough energy to push _",
    "of1 _ out from the galactic disk .",
    "we also compared the pressure of the molecular gas in the outflow with that of the soft x - ray outflow .",
    "the molecular gas pressure can be measured by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the h@xmath70 gas number density , @xmath105 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath106 is the molecular gas temperature . since our observations do not provide any density or temperature information , here we assume standard values , namely a molecular gas density and temperature traced by o(1 - 0 ) of @xmath107  @xmath108 and 10  100 k , respectively .",
    "thus the molecular gas pressure is estimated as @xmath109  dyne  @xmath11 .",
    "the thermal plasma outflow pressure is estimated as @xmath110  dyne  @xmath11 with the volume filling factor of 0.1  0.01 @xcite , the pressure of the thermal plasma outflow is therefore comparable or two orders of magnitude larger than that of the molecular outflow , depending on the volume filling factor for the x - ray emitting gas and the density and/or temperature of the molecular gas .",
    "this result further supports the capability of the thermal plasma to push _",
    "of1 _ out from the galactic disk .",
    "since the energy and the pressure of the x - ray emission is larger than that of the molecular outflow , it is natural to consider that the expanding force from x - ray emission is still pushing the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "the distribution , kinematics , energies , and pressure of the molecular gas and the hot thermal plasma outflows suggest that the hot thermal plasma pushes the molecular gas outward , and produces the large - scale outflows .",
    "the hot thermal plasma is caused by supernova explosions in the central starburst region of ngc 2146 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , very likely , the molecular gas outflow is also caused by the intense starbursts at the center of ngc 2146 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the arc - like feature of _ of1 _",
    ", with the conical structure of the hot thermal plasma outflow just behind _ of1 _ , suggests that the molecular outflow could have had a bubble - like structure at the beginning of the expansion , and then been blown out as an arc - like feature as it evolved .",
    "indeed , the molecular superbubble with hot gas inside observed in the central region of m82 @xcite could well represent an analogue of _ of1 _ at an early stage .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) support the evolution of a molecular superbubble to an outflow .",
    "one of their models simulated the evolution of a superbubble under the ism density of 100  @xmath108 , which corresponds to that of molecular gas seen in o(1 - 0 ) .",
    "supernova explosions at a constant rate for a long time produce a vast amount of hot gas , and the hot gas accelerates and expands the surrounding ism gradually .",
    "this model shows that the size of the molecular superbubble can expand to @xmath162 kpc on a timescale of @xmath1610@xmath111 years . since the supernova rate ( snr ) of this model adopts that of m82 ( 0.1 yr@xmath1 ) , and ngc 2146 has a similar snr ( 0.15 yr@xmath1 ; @xcite ) , this model can be considered valid for ngc 2146 .",
    "furthermore , the values of the size and the timescale from this model are similar to our observations , and therefore our results are consistent with the model .    at the center of the expanding molecular bubble _ sb1 _",
    ", diffuse soft x - ray emission , indicative of hot thermal plasma , seems to be present .",
    "figure  [ xray ] show two soft x - ray images with different spatial resolutions : figure  [ xray]a is the higher spatial resolution image , where point sources are clearly visible , while it is more difficult to see the diffuse components .",
    "figure  [ xray]b is the lower spatial resolution image , where diffuse components are more clearly seen .",
    "comparison of these two images can separate point sources and diffuse sources , and indeed at the center of _ sb1 _ , diffuse soft x - ray emission is detected .",
    "this situation is again similar to that observed in m82 and expected from hydrodynamical simulations , suggesting that the hot gas is embedded    inside of the expanding molecular bubble _ sb1 _ , pushing the surrounding molecular gas outward .",
    "a precise estimate of the energy of the soft x - ray component is , however , difficult since , in this region , the soft x - ray emission is absorbed by the foreground molecular gas and , therefore , any value derived for the energy would be significantly underestimated .",
    "here we discuss the possible configuration of the outflows and bubbles in the central @xmath2 of ngc 2146 based on our co and x - ray data , and the previously published optical spectra . a schematic diagram of the possible configuration of the molecular gas and other components is shown in figure  [ conf ] and , in the following paragraphs , its details are discussed .    as shown in section  [ sect - model ] , the molecular gas disk is well modeled by the standard rigid- and flat - rotation curves with an inclination of @xmath112 . based on this simple regular galactic kinematics , it is safe to assume that the galactic disk is flat and has no warp in the central region .",
    "comparison between the co in the galactic disk and the x - ray data indicates that the outflow is directed toward us in the northeastern side , and the co in the galactic disk in `` blocking '' the soft x - ray emission in the southwestern side , making that the near side ( sect .",
    "[ sect - xray ] ) . indeed ,",
    "the long - slit optical spectra along the minor axis show that the ionized gas is blueshifted to the northeast and redshifted to the southwest , and the spectra taken in the central @xmath113 show a blue asymmetry in the emission lines , suggesting that the ionized gas outflow is flowing toward us in the northeast , and the redshifted outflow is blocked by the galactic disk around the galactic center @xcite , which is consistent with the configuration we propose .",
    "the soft x - ray outflow shows a conical structure with a large opening angle ( see figure  [ xray ] ) , and the outflowing direction is inclined toward us . from the blue asymmetry in the optical spectra near the galactic center",
    ", the line - of - sight ionized gas outflow velocity toward us is estimated as @xmath114  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the redshifted side , on the other hand , shows only @xmath115  km  s@xmath1 ( estimated from figure  11 of @xcite ) , suggesting that the far side of the conical structure of the outflow is nearly perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "_ of1 _ is dominated by the redshifted gas , suggesting that most of the molecular gas is located at the far side of the conical structure .",
    "the line width of ionized gas increases with distance to the galactic center @xcite , suggesting an acceleration as the gas moves away , consistent with the kinematics of _",
    "_ sb1 _ is located in the southwestern part of the galaxy , indicating that _ sb1 _ is at the farside of the galactic disk .",
    "the radius of the molecular gas disk is about 2  kpc ( about @xmath116 ) with an inclination of @xmath112 , while the central velocity of _",
    "sb1 _ is somewhat blueshifted and the radius of _",
    "sb1 _ is about @xmath3  kpc .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to partially see _ sb1 _ , this has to be closer to us than the galactic center .    summing up all the aforementioned information",
    ", we made a schematic diagram of the possible configuration of the molecular gas and the hot gas outflows in figure  [ conf ] . in the figure",
    ", the molecular gas is shown in red , x - ray emission in yellow , and optical emission line in light blue . the emission obscured by the molecular gas ( and possibly dust that is mixed with the molecular gas ) in front",
    "is shaded .",
    "the overall configuration of this schematic diagram is globally consistent with that presented in @xcite but , by using our new observations , we have been able to describe the different structures and components presented in the inner region of ngc 2146 in greater detail .    in sections  [ sect - sb ] and [ sect - of ]",
    ", we derive the properties of _",
    "sb1 _ and _ of1_. since the timescale of _ sb1",
    "_ corresponds roughly to that of _ of1 _ , it is possible that _ sb1 _ and _ of1 _ originated from one starburst event .",
    "the difference in the structure ( _ sb1 _ is still a bubble while _ of1 _ is already outflowing ) can be explained by the possible location where the starburst may have started up ; if a starburst occured a bit above the galactic disk plane , an expansion upward is less frustrated than downward due to a less dense ism .",
    "since a bubble expands faster in less dense conditions @xcite , an expansion in a lower density ism leads to faster bubble evolution , and the bubble becomes an outflow earlier than that in a dense region .",
    "however , the possible central locations for _ sb1 _ and _ of1 _ are different ( figure  [ m0m1 ] ; see also figure  [ conf ] ) , it is difficult to say that _",
    "sb1 _ and _ of1 _ have the same explosion center .",
    "thus it is safer to conclude that _",
    "sb1 _ and _ of1 _ may have formed in the same explosion period , but at different locations .",
    "we observed the nearby nearly edge - on starburst galaxy ngc 2146 with the nma in the o(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "we performed a deep integration and successfully imaged a diffuse molecular outflow ( _ of1 _ ) and two superbubbles ( _ sb1 _ and _ sb2 _ ) , expanding from the galactic disk region .    _",
    "of1 _ is located toward the northeastern side of the galactic disk and shows a linear increase in velocity with the distance from the galactic disk .",
    "it shows an arc - like feature , and is located at the front edge of the soft x - ray outflow .",
    "the energy of _",
    "of1 _ is comparable to or an order of magnitude lower than that of the soft x - ray outflow .",
    "the pressure of _ of1 _ is about one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of the soft x - ray outflow .",
    "therefore these results suggest that _",
    "of1 _ is pushed outward by the energetic plasma outflow from the galactic disk .    _",
    "sb1 _ is located at the southwestern side of the galactic disk and shows an expanding motion .",
    "the soft x - ray image shows diffuse and weak emission at the center of _",
    "sb1_. since _ sb1 _ is located on the far side of the galactic disk from us , this weakness is likely due to the soft x - ray emission being highly absorbed by the galactic disk .",
    "it is not clear whether the soft x - ray emission can be the energy source of the expansion of _ sb1_. the lifetime of _",
    "sb1 _ and _ of1 _ are similar , and hence , we think that these structures have been formed during the same explosion period . _ sb2 _ is clearly visible in the position - velocity diagram , and has less mass than _",
    "sb1 _ , and is therefore less energetic than _ sb1_. possibly _",
    "sb2 _ has been caused by a less energetic starburst than the one that produced _",
    "of1 _ or _ sb1_.    the galactic disk seems to have two rigid - rotating components and one flat - rotating component .",
    "the inner rigid - rotating component has a steeper velocity gradient than the outer rigid - rotating component , and is @xmath117  pc in radius , indicating that there is a fast rotating nuclear disk in this galaxy .",
    "model fitting to the velocity field maps shows that the central region of the galactic disk of ngc 2146 can be explained by regular galactic rotation , and there is no clear evidence for molecular gas tracing an outflow inside the galactic disk .",
