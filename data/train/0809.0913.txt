    "the feature at @xmath8 in the spectrum of g2 is due to poor subtraction of a strong sky emission line ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "[ fig : spec1330 ] ]    thus far about 100 gravitationally lensed quasars are known , of which @xmath10 are quadruple ( four - image ) lenses .",
    "the number ratio of quadruple lenses to double ( two - image ) lenses contains information on both the shapes of lensing galaxies and the luminosity function of source quasars @xcite .",
    "in addition , quadruple lenses allow more detailed mass modelling of individual lenses . for instance , the larger number of images provides more constraints on the lens potential , which is essential in probing the effects of external perturbations on primary lenses @xcite and constraining the hubble constant from time delay measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "magnifications of merging image pairs in quadruple lenses satisfy distinct relations if the lens potential is smooth , but small - scale structures near the image can violate the relations",
    ". thus flux ratios of quadruple lens images serve as unique probes of substructure or microlensing in lens galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar with four lensed images , sdss  j133018.65 + 181032.1 ( sdss  j1330 + 1810 ) . it was discovered as part of the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search ( sqls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which takes advantage of the large spectroscopic quasar catalog ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to locate new lensed quasars .",
    "we place particular emphasis on mass modeling and investigation of the structure around the lens .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the sdss and follow - up data in sections [ sec : sdss ] and [ sec : followup ] , respectively .",
    "the environment of the lens is discussed in section [ sec : env ] .",
    "section [ sec : model ] is devoted to mass modelling .",
    "our results are summarised in section [ sec : sum ] . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt the standard lambda - dominated flat universe cosmology with matter density @xmath11 and the hubble constant @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we constrain the lens potential of this system using the observed image positions and flux ratios .",
    "the relative positions of the quasar images and galaxies and their errors are adopted from table [ table : sdss1330 ] .",
    "flux ratios are estimated from the median of the measurements in the five follow - up images ( see figure [ fig : fratio ] ) .",
    "note that the flux ratios agree well with those of the @xmath13-band image for which the effect of dust extinction is small .",
    "considering the scatter , we assume a conservative error on the magnitude difference between quasar images , @xmath14 . we adopt two standard mass models that are widely used in modelling strong lens systems ; a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) and an sie plus external shear perturbation ( siex ) .",
    "since it is of interest whether the models can explain the observed flux ratios or not , for each model we consider two cases ; one includes flux ratios as observational constraints and the other only uses relative positions as constraints . the optimisation of model parameters is performed using a software package called _ glafic _ ( m. oguri , in preparation ) .     for best - fit parameters .",
    "the black curve and squares indicate the critical curve of the best - fit model and the predicted image positions . observed image positions are within the symbols .",
    "grey curves and the square are the corresponding caustics and source position .",
    "[ fig : crit1330 ] ]    best - fit @xmath15 and model parameters are summarised in table [ table : model ] .",
    "we find that all four models considered here produce reasonably good fits to the data ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the models successfully fit the flux ratios , therefore this lens system does not exhibit any sign of flux ratio anomaly .",
    "moreover , the flux ratios predicted by models with no flux ratio constraints broadly agree with observed flux ratios .",
    "the successful mass modeling further supports the lensing nature of this system .",
    "we show the critical curve and caustics for the best - fit model ( siex with flux ratios as constraints ) in figure [ fig : crit1330 ] , which indicates that images b and d are saddle - point images and images a and c are minima . given the best - fit mass models",
    ", we can predict time delays between the images . assuming that the lensing galaxy is located at @xmath2 , for each best - fit model we compute time delays between image a and the other images , which are listed in table [ table : model ] .",
    "time delays are rather model dependent , particularly for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for which the maximum fractional differences between different models are @xmath19 .",
    "this is because shorter time delays are more easily affected by perturbations in the primary lens potential @xcite .",
    "-band image around the lens system .",
    "north is up and east is left .",
    "shear directions in our best - fit models ( @xmath20 for the model without flux constraints , and @xmath21 for the model with flux constraints ) are shown by thick solid lines .",
    "directions to a nearby bright galaxy ( g3 ) and the centre of the group ( g1/g2 ) are indicated by thin solid lines .",
    "[ fig : uh_shear ] ]    the large ellipticities of @xmath22 in the best - fit models are broadly consistent with the observed shape of the lensing galaxy ( see section [ sec : image ] ) .",
    "we find that the best - fit position angle of the galaxy , @xmath23 , is different between models with and without external shear : @xmath24 when the external shear is not included , whereas @xmath25 for models including external shear .",
    "the observed position angle of galaxy g , @xmath26 , agrees very well with the latter , suggesting the non - negligible effect of external shear on the lens potential , as in other quadruple lens systems @xcite .",
    "however , there is no obvious perturber along the shear direction , @xmath20 or @xmath21 ( see figure [ fig : uh_shear ] ) .",
    "thus in figure [ fig : eg ] we present likelihood contours in the @xmath23-@xmath27 plane .",
    "specifically , for each ( @xmath23 , @xmath27 ) we perform @xmath15 minimisations and use @xmath28 to draw contours at the 1@xmath29 and 2@xmath29 confidence levels .",
    "we find that the shear direction to galaxy g3 is consistent with the observations at the 1@xmath29 level .",
    "the resultant ellipticity position angle is @xmath30 and is also consistent with the observed orientation of the lensing galaxy . on the other hand , the shear direction to galaxies g1 and g2 fails to fit the data at the @xmath31 level .",
    "therefore we conclude that nearby galaxy g3 , rather than the group of galaxies @xmath4 southwest of the lens , is likely to be the main perturber to the lens system .",
    "although the shear amplitudes of @xmath32 are slightly larger than would be produced by a single galaxy @xmath33 away from the lens , the existence of the group suggests that dark matter sufficient to produce the shear amplitudes can be associated with galaxy g3 .",
    "this idea is supported by an apparent concentration of galaxies at @xmath34 around g3 ( see figure [ fig : env ] ) .     and 2@xmath29 contours ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 for 2 degree of freedom ) of the position angles of the ellipticity and external shear for the siex model .",
    "note that the other model parameters are marginalised over .",
    "flux ratios are included as constraints .",
    "the cross indicates the best - fit values ( see table [ table : model ] ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the observed orientation of the lensing galaxy .",
    "horizontal dotted lines are expected values ( see also figure  [ fig : uh_shear ] ) when the external perturbations are caused by the centre of the group ( g1/g2 ) or the nearby bright galaxy ( g3 ) .",
    "[ fig : eg ] ]    given the best - fit einstein radius @xmath37 , we can compute magnitudes of the lensing galaxy expected from the faber - jackson relation @xcite , adopting the model of @xcite . from the lens redshift @xmath2 , the apparent magnitudes are predicted to be @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are @xmath42  mag fainter than the observed total magnitudes of the lensing galaxy . using the same model , we find that the observed magnitudes correspond to the lens redshift of @xmath43 .",
    "the discrepancy is substantially larger than the observed 1@xmath29 scatter in the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath44  mag ) . while it is not clear what causes the difference , a possible explanation is an interaction with nearby structure which can strip the outer part of the galaxy mass and reduce the einstein radius without changing the overall luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is no obvious companion galaxy at @xmath45 around galaxy g , and no obvious signature of interaction in the galaxy images .",
    "again , extensive spectroscopy of galaxies in the field to study structure around the lens redshift might help to resolve this issue .",
    "we have presented the discovery of a new four - image lensed quasar sdss j1330 + 1810 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this source was selected as a lens candidate by the sqls due to its extended morphology .",
    "our observations in optical and near - infrared indicate that it is a typical fold - type quadruple lens , with a maximum separation between images of @xmath1 . from the spectrum we measured a lens redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "standard simple elliptical mass models fit the data well , including the flux ratios , implying no evidence for substructure .",
    "the mass modelling suggests an important contribution of the external shear , probably from a nearby bright galaxy .",
    "there is also a foreground group of galaxies whose centre is @xmath46 from the lens .",
    "the lens galaxy is @xmath5  mag brighter than predicted by mass modelling .",
    "thus far the sqls has discovered 31 lensed quasars including sdss j1330 + 1810 , of which 5 are quadruple lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the low fraction of quadruple lenses may imply that the faint end slope of the quasar optical luminosity function is shallow , although it is marginally consistent with standard theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the sqls has completed @xmath47 of its survey , implying that a few more quadruple lenses will be discovered by the completion of the survey .",
