    "dynamic pet studies provide the opportunity to image functional metabolic parameters of tissue in - vivo [ @xcite ] .",
    "although there have been many developments in this direction [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , muzi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , veronese et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] , no procedure has yet been widely adopted for routine use .",
    "most often quantitation of dynamic pet studies is based on consideration of a single time point for a user - defined region of interest ( roi ) . in view of the complexity of pet imaging and its expense , this is unsatisfactory . as most radiotracers used in pet act in a linear and time - invariant fashion , dynamic pet imaging measures the convolution between the activity of the tracer in the arterial blood supply and the tissue impulse response .",
    "the impulse response is known as the tissue residue function . in statistical terms",
    "the residue is the life table associated with the collection of pet tracer atoms introduced , typically by intravenous injection , to the circulatory system .",
    "the residue has its roots in the seminal indicator dilution work of @xcite .",
    "kinetic analysis of pet data is substantially concerned with modeling and estimation of the residue function . to this end",
    ", there are a suite of commonly used compartmental models [ @xcite ] . however , while compartmental models adequately represent the biochemistry of well - mixed homogeneous in - vitro samples , they are not necessarily well suited to represent micro - vascular flows and micro - heterogeneity that are part of in - vivo tissue [ bassingthwaighte ( @xcite ) , li , yipintsoi and bassingthwaighte ( @xcite ) and @xcite ] .",
    "consequently , there is interest in more flexible nonparametric approaches to the estimation of the tissue residues . among the most popular approaches",
    "is the spectral method introduced by @xcite . here",
    "residues are approximated by nonnegative sums of exponentials , whose amplitudes and rate constants are adapted to the data ; see veronese et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a recent treatment and review .",
    "spectral methods have the complexity of requiring estimating of a set of intrinsically nonlinear exponential rate constants .",
    "this is a significant practical computational challenge ; see zeng et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , for example .",
    "but spectral methods also have a theoretical limitation in that they force the negative - derivative of residue function , aka the transit time density of tracer - atoms , to be monotonically decreasing from a mode at zero .",
    "this assumption is at odds with micro - vascular flow measurements which support a more log - normal or gamma - like form for the transit time density . if the residue is to be estimated nonparametrically , it is desirable to have a procedure , like that given in hawe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) or osullivan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , that does not impose an unrealistic physiologic assumption on the residue function ab initio .",
    "our focus here is on voxel - level estimation .",
    "the method approximates voxel - level residues by a mixture of _ basis _ residue functions that have been optimized by applying a backward elimination technique to a segmentation of the entire volume of data .",
    "the use of mixtures in this setting is not new [ @xcite ] , however , unlike the previous work , which has involved approximation of mixtures of compartmental models by a compartmental model form , the current approach does not require this step .",
    "an important aspect of the methodology is decomposition of the tissue residue to separately focus on characteristics associated with short transit times of tracer atoms in the vasculature , distinct from slower transit times associated with blood - tissue exchange and retention",
    ". this decomposition parallels the often separate consideration given to early and late life - time mortality patterns in human life tables .",
    "the methodology leads to a practical quadratic programming - based algorithm for voxel - level residue reconstruction and associated generation of functional metabolic images of parameters of interest . for a typical dynamic pet study the analysis , including the segmentation steps , runs on a 3.2  ghz pc in less than 30 minutes . in the context of pet scanning in cancer applications ,",
    "that is , about 90% of all clinical pet imaging studies , this is completely adequate for routine operational use .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents the basic statistical models underlying the approach .",
    "inference and model selection methodology are developed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] presents illustrations with imaging data from both normal subjects and cancer patients .",
    "performance of the methodology for @xmath0f fluoro - deoxyglucose ( fdg ) and @xmath1o water ( h2o ) imaging studies is considered in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "this includes comparisons with compartmental model analysis and more theoretical evaluation via simulations .",
    "let @xmath2 represent the concentration of tracer atoms at time @xmath3 in a tissue voxel with three - dimensional spatial coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 , measured as activity per unit mass ( mg ) of tissue , evolves in response to the localized arterial input function , denoted @xmath5 and measured as activity per unit volume ( ml ) of whole blood .",
    "the basic assumption of most pet imaging is that the interaction of the tracer with the tissue can be approximated as a linear and time - invariant process .",
    "thus , the measurable concentration arises as a convolution between the tissue response and the arterial input function @xmath6 here @xmath7 is tissue response and , borrowing terminology of the work of meier and zierler ( @xcite ) on indicator dilutions , @xmath8 is called the residue function .",
    "formally , @xmath8 is proportional to the impulse response of the tissue at location @xmath4 and has units of flow ( ml@xmath9g@xmath9min ) .",
    "if all tracer atoms were instantaneously introduced in a unit volume of blood , @xmath8 would give the number remaining in the tissue as a function of time .",
    "if @xmath10 tracer atoms per ml are introduced in the arterial blood supply to the tissue , for small time increments @xmath11 , then the number of those atoms , per gram of tissue , remaining in the tissue over the time interval @xmath12 $ ] is @xmath13 . in statistical terms",
    ", @xmath8 defines the life table for the time variable which measures the duration of stay of the tracer atom in the tissue  the transit time .",
    "tracer atom transit times are viewed as random  they arise from a range of interactions with an array of micro - vascular flow paths , transporters , enzymes , ligands , etc . that have the potential to influence the overall length of time the tracer atom is in the local tissue region .",
    "measurable transit times are restricted to the observation window @xmath14 $ ] of the scanning and , apart from the complexity of indirect measurement by the convolution equation , there is censoring because tracer atoms decay over time .",
    "such restrictions will be familiar , as they arise in traditional life - table work .      to better understand the residue",
    ", it is helpful to separate the early ( vascular ) component from the later components that are associated with longer term interaction with the tissue and also retention . using @xmath15 as a cutoff for rapid ( large - vessel ) transit times",
    ", a decomposition of the residue is obtained as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the constant @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to @xmath21 as the rapid vascular component , @xmath22 as the exchangeable or in - distribution component and @xmath23 as the ( apparent ) extracted component .",
    "_ apparent _ is used because the ultimate ( asymptotic ) extraction is not strictly observable based on the finite duration of the study , however , as it is common to choose @xmath24 large enough that there would be little further decline in the residue at times greater than @xmath24 , @xmath20 should be a good approximation to the relevant flux of the tracer atoms into tissue .",
    "the decomposition in ( [ eq2 ] ) is dependent on the value of @xmath25 ( and @xmath24 ) . for human imaging ,",
    "the choice of @xmath26 minute is reasonable , as this matches the early vascular distribution time for intravenously injected contrast agents , upon which the standard scanning duration used to assess local blood volume parameters in computerized tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance ( mr ) is based [ provenzale et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] . in the absence of other information ,",
    "the temporal resolution of a pet study for the residue can be no better than the temporal sampling of scanning and the sharpness of the arterial input resulting from the intravenous injection of the tracer .",
    "each component of the residue decomposition in ( [ eq2 ] ) is itself a residue or life table .",
    "the extracted component is constant but the vascular and distribution components carry information beyond scale .",
    "key parameters for a residue function are its maximum and integral values , which represent the flow and volume occupied by the collection of tracer atoms defined by the residue [ meier and zierler ( @xcite ) , hawe et al . ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "so based on the decomposition in ( [ eq2 ] ) , we identify five summary parameters of particular interest ",
    "vascular flow and volume ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , distribution flow and volume ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the apparent flux ( @xmath31 ) which is seen as the net flux of tracer into tissue up to time @xmath24 .",
    "a further parameter of interest is the extraction fraction , defined by @xmath32 . in the case where the residue is exponential , for example , a 1-compartment model [ e.g. , bassingwaighte ( @xcite ) ] with rate constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , the flow @xmath36 reduces to @xmath33 and as @xmath37 the exchangeable volume @xmath38",
    "also , for a 2-compartment fdg model [ phelps et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] with @xmath39 and @xmath35 , as @xmath37 @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the flux value @xmath42 .",
    "substitution of the residue decomposition ( [ eq2 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) gives a decomposition of the tracer tissue concentration as a sum of vascular ( @xmath43 ) , in distribution ( @xmath44 ) and extracted ( @xmath45 ) components @xmath46 the sum @xmath47 is the extravascular component .",
    "examples of this are shown in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "as @xmath23 is constant , @xmath48 is the product of flux and the cumulative arterial activity . at late time points , vascular and exchangeable concentration",
    "are safely ignored so the late time concentration is effectively proportional to the cumulative arterial activity .",
    "this is the basis of a model - free approach to the analysis of flux [ patlak , blasberg and fenstermacher ( @xcite ) ] .      a variety of blood - tissue exchange models , for example , bassingwaighte ( @xcite ) , huang and phelps ( @xcite ) and gunn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , as well as many general life - table methods , for example , cox and oakes ( @xcite ) and @xcite , might be used to approximate tissue residue functions .",
    "we should allow any approach that does not systematically misrepresent the physiologic / metabolic processes involved .",
    "validation of model formulations for pet tracers is difficult . in - vitro studies",
    "clarify important biochemical transformations involved , but satisfactory in - vivo validation of model assumptions related to the structure of micro - vasculature flows and heterogeneities is not possible .",
    "the most widely used one- and two - compartment models in pet reduce to representation of the residue by sums of mono - exponential functions . while these models may adequately represent the biochemistry involved ,",
    "their ability to describe the complexities of vascular transport is limited .",
    "indeed , in the standard compartmental models the tracer atom transit time density is always monotonically decreasing , so the modal transit time for the nonextracted tracer is always zero .",
    "physiologically this is difficult to justify [ bassingwaighte ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "we use an additive model that approximates the local tissue residue by a positive linear sum of a fixed set of distinct basis residue functions , @xmath49 , that have themselves been derived from a nonparametric analysis of time courses arising from a full segmentation of the data volume .",
    "the model is @xmath50 where the @xmath51 s are nonnegative constants . for simplicity , the basis residues are normalized to have maximum of unity , that is , @xmath52 for @xmath53 . assuming @xmath54 can be described by a delayed version of a sampled arterial time - course @xmath55 , which , in view of the temporal resolution of pet , is reasonable , equation ( [ eq4 ] ) implies @xmath56 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } + \\alpha_{j}(x ) \\bar c_{j } \\bigl(t-\\delta(x ) \\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 for @xmath58 . for known delay , @xmath59 ,",
    "the model is linear in the @xmath60-coefficients .",
    "note estimation of the @xmath60 s in ( [ eq5 ] ) allows the local residues to be determined by equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) ; from them associated flow and volume parameters of section  [ sec2.1 ] can be recovered .",
    "\\1 . if the @xmath61 s in ( [ eq5 ] ) correspond to specific regional time courses , a  mixture model interpretation for the model can be developed .",
    "this is reasonable , as the population of available metabolic pathways for a tracer atom is determined by the profile of enzymes , receptor ligands or transporters that are represented . across a collection of voxels these profiles vary with a greater representation of certain characteristics in some voxels than in others .",
    "thus , the transit time for a randomly chosen tracer atom in voxel @xmath4 can be expected to select a metabolic pathway in accordance with the distribution of pathways available within the voxel , and the @xmath60-coefficients ( scaled to sum to unity ) could be viewed as a set of mixing proportions ; see osullivan ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the form in equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) can also be viewed as an example of a general multivariate factor analysis ( without reference to residues ) .",
    "such models have been used to describe pet time - course data ; see , for example , kassinen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , @xcite , lee et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and zhou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "a tissue region can contain significant nonarterial blood vessels . depending on tissue location , separate signals associated with major blood pools in the circulatory system , such as the right ventricle of the heart , the lungs , venous blood and the venous supply path from the injection site to the heart , might need to be considered .",
    "this can be accomplished by augmenting equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to include terms representing nonarterial blood signals .",
    "obviously this is particularly relevant in the thoracic imaging where the direct or indirect ( via a spillover artifact ) impact of nonarterial cardiac and pulmonary blood signals can be significant .",
    "venous blood vessels arise throughout the body , so there is a case for always including a venous signal term . but rarely does the simultaneous measurement of arterial and venous blood activity arise in a pet study .",
    "venous blood can be viewed as a response to the arterial supply , so the venous signal is sensibly represented as a whole - body response to the arterial supply@xmath62 .",
    "thus , if an explicit venous signal is not available , the structure of our modeling approach allows for the component @xmath63-residues to adapt to @xmath64 so that the overall tissue residue will have the venous component included .",
    "as mean transit times from arterial to venous blood are short ( @xmath651 minute ) , our proposed decomposition of the residue with @xmath66 will be a combination of pure arterial , venous contributions .",
    "hence , @xmath28 should be viewed as an estimate of the volume ( per mg ) of large arterial and large venous vessels in the tissue .",
    "thus , if an explicit venous blood signal is included ( @xmath67 ) , the local estimate of blood volume should be the sum of the venous volume [ i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the estimated residue in  ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "\\3 . due to limited resolution",
    ", voxel - level data are subject to mixing and partial volume effects , which are reasonably modeled by mixtures ; see also section  [ sec3.3 ] .",
    "the estimation of voxel - level residues involves three steps .",
    "first , a segmentation procedure is applied to extract scaled time - course patterns from the measured set of voxel - level time courses in the data .",
    "next , the time courses are analyzed to recover a nonparametric residue function for each and a backward elimination procedure is used to obtain a reduced set of basis residue functions .",
    "the final step does voxel - level optimization of @xmath60-coefficients and delay in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) with subsequent evaluation of the voxel residue in equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) and the key parameters identified in section  [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "the details involved in each of these steps are presented below . as the analysis is based on a voxel - level fitting process ,",
    "the residuals associated with the fitting process provide useful diagnostic information .",
    "some proposals for examining the temporal and spatial patterns in those residuals are indicated .",
    "a split - and - merge segmentation procedure from@xcite is used .",
    "the procedure groups voxels on the basis of the shape of the measured time course , the _ scaled _ time course .",
    "the splitting employs a principal component analysis to recursively divide the tissue volume into a large collection ( typically 10,000 ) of hyper - rectangular regions whose scaled time - course patterns show maximal homogeneity .",
    "the merging process then recursively combines ( initially with a constraint to ensure that segments consist of contiguous collections of voxels ) these regions to create a collection of regions with high average within - region homogeneity . for the analyses reported here",
    ", the number of segments used is taken to be large enough to explain 95% of the variance in the scaled time - course data , about 712 segments for a typical cerebral study and 1520 segments for a chest or abdominal study .",
    "the choice of the number of segments was examined in @xcite . as the focus of the algorithm is on _ scaled _ time - course information , the extracted segments are well suited for use in subsequent mixture modeling .",
    "a particular advantage of the scaled approach is that it results in fewer segments than might otherwise be required to explain a comparable proportion of variance in the data .",
    "it is helpful to display segments to connect with anatomy .",
    "if the average scaled time course for a segment is given by a vector @xmath70 , imaging the @xmath70-weighted average of the voxel - level time - course data in the segment is effective .",
    "some examples are shown in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the time bins of data acquisition are @xmath71@xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the segmentation algorithm provides a mean time course and associated sample variance vector , @xmath74 for @xmath75 , for each of @xmath76 segments .",
    "arising from the underlying poisson emissions that are the basis of the imaging process , regional time - course data have an approximate quasi - poisson structure [ see @xcite ; carson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and @xcite ] , that is , @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "thus , up to known calibration factors ( incorporating time - bin duration and voxel dimension ) , the mean values are proportional to the integrated concentration per milligram of radioactive tracer atoms which in turn is a function of the regional residue @xmath79 and input arterial supply : @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents isotope decay and @xmath82 is an appropriate delay .",
    "note @xmath83 here represents the total ( radioactive and nonradioactive ) tracer atom concentration at time @xmath3 .",
    "an initial set of possible residue basis elements are obtained by representation of the @xmath79 s in terms of b - splines [ osullivan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] . here",
    "the b - spline coefficients and the delay @xmath82 are optimized by weighted least squares with weights @xmath84 given by @xmath85 .",
    "we seek to express the segment residues in terms of a reduced set of basis residue forms .",
    "since retention is apparent in nearly all residues , it makes sense to ensure that the constant residue function ( a _ patlak _ term , cf .",
    "section  [ sec2.1 ] ) is a fixed member of any basis .",
    "thus , the focus of the basis search is on representation of the nonretained residue components .",
    "suppose we have a set of @xmath86 such normalized basis elements denoted @xmath87 for @xmath88 as well as the constant unit value patlak residue , @xmath89 .",
    "with these , the residue for the @xmath90th segment ( @xmath79 ) is approximated by the ( nonnegative ) linear combination @xmath91 by substitution into ( [ eq : rb ] ) , the @xmath92-coefficients and delay can be optimized to the observed segment data .",
    "a weighted least squares fitting is used with weights given by @xmath93 .",
    "an approximate unbiased risk assessment criterion is used to obtain an overall assessment of the @xmath94-component basis .",

    "we have data with substantially the same structure as the segment - level data , @xmath122 above . if @xmath123 for @xmath124 is the pet measured activity at the @xmath125th voxel , from equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 where @xmath129 , and with @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",

    "this result supports mapping voxel - level residues because it allows subsequent analysis of regions of interest to be simply achieved by direct application of rois to voxel - level residue information .      at high doses mse",
    "can be expected to be dominated by variance . since equation ( [ eq16 ] )",
    "is a linear model , the covariance of the estimated @xmath60-coefficients at the @xmath125th voxel , which are obtained by a weighted least squares procedure , will be approximated by @xmath224^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath225 and @xmath226 . here ,",
    "to simplify the notation , we have dropped the subscripts @xmath125 and @xmath90 .",
    "this variance approximation will become more reliable at high doses when the constraints on the @xmath60-coefficients are , typically , not active .",
    "recall from equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath227 involves the convolution of the normalized residue @xmath87 and the arterial input function , @xmath228 .",
    "so if @xmath228 is expressed as @xmath229 where @xmath230 has amplitude of unity , @xmath231 can be expressed as @xmath232^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath233 the same as @xmath234 but with @xmath235 now involving convolution of the normalized residue and normalized arterial input @xmath236 .",
    "thus , at high doses the variance and , consequently , the mse , will be inversely proportional to dose ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath238 , as was found for fdg in the simulation .",
    "the slower convergence ( @xmath223 ) for h2o may be a reflection of a greater dependence on constraints , due to the higher noise . when constraints are active , the standard weighted least squares covariance formula will not be reliable .",
    "we have presented an approach to the estimation of voxel - level tracer residues from pet time - course data .",
    "the technique uses a data - adaptive mixture model that allows for voxel - level variation in the time of arrival of the tracer in the arterial supply .",
    "the mixture representation of local residues is plausible and has been used previously with basis residues that are a compartmental model or have simple exponential forms [ @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "the present work shows that it is possible to also use nonparametric forms for the basis residues .",
    "this allows the possibility to better investigate potential deviations from compartmental - like descriptions of tissue residues .",
    "computationally , the linearity of mixture models is attractive , as it facilitates the implementation based on efficient use of standard quadratic programming tools .",
    "the work has a reliance on multivariate statistical methods and uses backward elimination guided by an unbiased risk type model selection statistic .",
    "residue functions are life tables for the transit time of radiotracer atoms . just as infant and elderly mortality patterns might be given separate attention in a human life table , decomposition of the residue can provide insight into the tracer kinetics .",
    "our approach emphasizes decomposition of residue to focus on flow and volume characteristics of vascular and in distribution transport as well as the ( apparent ) rate of extraction of the tracer by tissue , that is , flux .",
    "thus , we have a 5-number summary for the residue . the life - table perspective on the tissue residue emphasized in this paper may encourage broader interest in adapting methods from mainstream survival analysis for application to the growing needs for quantitation in pet studies and for related contrast tracking techniques used in computerized tomography and magnetic resonance [ schmid et al . ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "pet imaging has grown in importance particularly in the context of cancer , where over 90% of clinical imaging with pet is carried out .",
    "having more sophisticated kinetic analysis tools , such as residue analysis , can enhance the type of information recovered from these studies .",
    "this may potentially lead to better procedures for selecting and monitoring cancer treatments in order to optimize the patient outcomes .",
    "a number of current clinical imaging trails with pet in cancer already have reliance on detailed kinetic analysis for extraction of diagnostic information .",
    "given the nature of the problems involved , there is an opportunity for statistics to play a greater role in these developments .",
    "we are grateful to the referees , associate editor and the editor for a number of comments which led to significant improvements to the manuscript ."
