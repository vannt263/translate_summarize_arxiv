    "fractal approximation is important because there are a lot of objects which must be modeled by fractals in the nature .",

    "fractal interpolation functions were constructed in the case where interpolation points on the boundary data sets on a grid of rectangular are collinear , which were generalized in @xcite , @xcite , where any data set on the rectangular was used .",

    "the fractal functions constructed by the interpolation are always continuous , see @xcite-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
