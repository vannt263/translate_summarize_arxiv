    "one of the robust predictions of inflation that distinguishes it from numerous alternatives such as topological - defect or isocurvature models is that large - scale structure grew from a gaussian distribution of primordial density perturbations .",
    "however , even if the primordial distribution was gaussian , subsequent gravitational evolution would introduce deviations from gaussianity .",
    "a gaussian distribution is symmetric with respect to overdense and underdense regions , but as gravitational amplification of density perturbations proceeds , overdensities can become arbitrarily large . on the other hand ,",
    "any given region can become only so underdense ( since densities must be positive ) .",
    "thus , the resulting distribution is necessarily skewed .",
    "peebles ( 1980 ) calculated perturbatively the normalized skewness induced by gravitational instability of initially gaussian perturbations in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath2/\\bar\\rho$ ] is the fractional density perturbation and @xmath3 is the density at position @xmath4 , then in an einstein - de sitter universe , the statistic @xmath5 .",
    "bouchet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) generalized this result to an open or closed universe containing only pressureless matter and found that the prediction for @xmath6 remains the same to @xmath7 for any reasonable value of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , they showed that measurements of @xmath6 from galaxy surveys should provide a robust test of gaussian initial conditions , independent of @xmath9 , but only if the universe consists of just pressureless matter .",
    "however , slow - roll inflation predicts that the universe is flat , while observations seem to point to a matter density @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , if inflation is correct , then there must be some other missing energy density .",
    "the most widely considered form for this density is a cosmological constant ( with pressure given by @xmath11 ) , but theorists have also realized that this missing energy might be characterized by any of a number of equations of state . among these are some energy density that scales as @xmath12 ( @xmath13-matter ) , where @xmath14 is the scale factor of the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , something akin to an evolving cosmological constant , possibly generated by the dynamics of some scalar field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or some combination of several forms of missing energy .    to test for primordial gaussianity of density perturbations in this cornucopia of missing - energy models , we calculate the induced skewness in flat models with a cosmological constant and/or some other form(s ) of energy . for completeness",
    "we also consider open and closed universes with a variety of equations of state",
    ". for all cosmological models investigated , the numerical results for @xmath6 never deviate from 34/7 by more than 2% for models with @xmath15 , and no more than about @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the normalized skewness does indeed provide a robust test for primordial gaussianity , independent of the nature of the species that constitute the total energy density .    the bispectrum ( fourier transform of the induced three - point correlation function ) has also been calculated , as a byproduct of the calculation of the skewness , for gaussian initial conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in an einstein - de sitter universe and in a universe with pressureless matter ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we provide results for the bispectrum for the models we investigate .",
    "the details of our calculation are presented in the next section .",
    "we write down the differential equation , for an arbitrary expansion history , that must be solved to obtain the growth of the skewness . in section 3 , we provide numerical results for the skewness and bispectrum for several forms of missing energy and for some models with various combinations of missing energy .",
    "we also provide an analytic approximation to these quantities as a function of @xmath9 for flat cosmological - constant models .",
    "we then make some concluding remarks .",
    "the calculation of the bispectrum and skewness is outlined in detail in peebles ( 1980 ) and fry ( 1984 ) , and we simply highlight the relevant steps below ; bouchet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) employ an alternative approach based on the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the friedmann equation for the expansion rate as a function of redshift , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the present - day value of the hubble parameter , the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time @xmath21 , and @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the contribution to the overall energy density from species @xmath24 having equation of state @xmath25 . in this formulation",
    ", the curvature of the universe contributes an amount @xmath26 to the total energy density , and yields the term @xmath27 in the sum in equation ( [ eq : expansionrate ] ) .",
    "thus , in a universe with , for example , nonrelativistic - matter density @xmath9 and cosmological - constant contribution to closure density of @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the deceleration can be written as @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be obtained by differentiating equation ( [ eq : expansionrate ] ) . for example , for the @xmath32 given above , @xmath33 .",
    "if the fractional density perturbation is small ( @xmath34 ) , the equations of motion for @xmath35 can be solved perturbatively using the expansion @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the perturbative equations for the lowest - order term , @xmath38 , turn out to be separable , @xmath39 , and the familiar linear - theory growth factor satisfies @xmath40    the next - order equation of motion is @xmath41 d_1 ^ 2 \\delta_1 ^ 2       \\nonumber \\\\       & + &     \\left[{3 \\omega_0 h_0 ^ 2 \\over 2 } \\left ( { a_0 \\over       a } \\right)^3 + 2 \\left ( { \\dot d_1 \\over d_1 } \\right)^2       \\right ] d_1 ^ 2 \\delta_{1,i } \\delta_{1,i } + \\left ( { \\dot d_1       \\over d_1 } \\right)^2 d_1 ^ 2       ( \\delta_{1,ij } )   ( \\delta_{1,ij } ) , \\label{eq : longequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 the homogeneous part of equation ( [ eq : longequation ] ) is the same as that for equation ( [ eq : lineartheory ] ) , and it turns out that the solution for @xmath43 is dominated by the inhomogeneous terms on the right - hand side . since the inhomogeneous part is the sum of three terms with two different time dependences , the solution for @xmath43 is not obviously separable . however , the complete solution is simply the sum of the solutions to the equations given by the homogeneous equation driven by each of these sources separately .",
    "we may thus write the solution as @xmath44 where the second - order growth factors satisfy @xmath45 @xmath46 with the initial conditions that the growth factors and their first time derivatives are zero at @xmath47 .",
    "although it appears that there are two differential equations ( for @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) to be solved for the second - order solution , it can be verified that @xmath50 .",
    "thus , there is really only one independent second - order differential equation .",
    "the first of these equations ( [ eq : d2aequation ] ) can be solved analytically for the einstein - de sitter model with the result that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for more general models , equations ( [ eq : lineartheory ] ) and ( [ eq : d2aequation ] )",
    "can be integrated numerically .",

    "[ to clarify , the results do not really depend on the geometry of the universe , but rather on the expansion history @xmath32 .",

    "the robustness of these measures allows for excellent model - independent tests of structure formation from gravitational instability of a gaussian distribution of primordial perturbations .",

    "if so , then it is conceivable that the skewness would deviate from the gravitational - instability prediction .",

    "analytic approximations suggest that on small scales ( @xmath77 mpc ) , scalar - field ordering should not significantly affect the skewness ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we expect that in ( non - topological ) scalar - field models , the prediction @xmath78 should hold for gaussian initial conditions .    in practice , other factors must be considered when comparing measurements of the observed skewness and bispectrum with the predictions above .",
    "for example , the skewness calculated above is that for an unsmoothed density field , while the observed distribution is intrinsically discrete .",
    "bernardeau ( 1994 ) considered the effects of smoothing , and it is straightforward to apply the discussion therein to generalize our results for @xmath6 . in particular , for the case of smoothing with a spherical top - hat filter for scale - free power spectra @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the result for the smoothed distribution . in addition , the skewness and bispectrum presented here are those for the underlying mass distribution .",

    "more realistic calculations involving , for example , true scale - dependent power spectra or bias evolution have been obtained using numerical techniques ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model - independence of the predicted skewness and bispectrum for the matter distribution makes determinations of the bias from measurements of these quantities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that much more robust .",
    "the robustness of the scaled skewness to the expansion history supports the notion that the geometry of gravitationally collapsing objects is determined almost exclusively by the initial conditions .",
    "this leads us to speculate that the predictions for the higher - order moments and correlation functions ( e.g. , kurtosis , four - point correlation function , trispectrum , and so forth ) will be similarly independent of the expansion history .",
