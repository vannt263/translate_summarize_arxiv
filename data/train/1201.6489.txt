    "the higgs sector is unknown , because no higgs boson has been discovered yet . in the standard model ( sm ) for elementary particles , only one scalar iso - doublet field",
    "is introduced to break the electroweak gauge symmetry spontaneously . however , as the various models beyond the sm predict the extended higgs sector , there is a possibility of non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "the non - minimal higgs sectors suffer from the constraints from the rho parameter and the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) in general . in the sm , these constraints are automatically satisfied . it is known that in the higgs sector with only doublets , the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level .",
    "therefore , two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) would be a simplest viable extension of the sm . however , in the thdm the most general yukawa interaction predicts fcnc at the tree level , because both the doublet couples to a fermion so that the mass matrix and the yukawa matrix can not be diagonalized simultaneously . in order to avoid this",
    ", a discrete symmetry may be introduced under which different properties are assigned to each scalar doublet  @xcite . under this symmetry ,",
    "each fermion couples with only one scalar doublet , and hence there is no fcnc at the tree level even in the thdm .",
    "there are four types of yukawa interactions depending on the @xmath1-charge assignments ; i.e. , type - i , ii , x and y. an interesting possibility would be the type - x thdm , where one higgs doublet couples with quarks and the other does with leptons  @xcite .",
    "the type - x thdm can appear in the higgs sector of a gauged extension of the type - iii seesaw model  @xcite , the model of the three - loop neutrino mass with electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite and a model for the positron cosmic ray anomaly  @xcite .",

    "a softly broken @xmath1 symmetry is imposed in the model to forbid fcnc at the tree level , under which the higgs doublets are transformed as @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the soft - breaking parameter @xmath7 and the coupling constant @xmath8 are complex in general .",
    "we here take them to be real assuming the cp invariant higgs sector .",
    "the higgs doublets can be written in terms of the component fields as @xmath9 where the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 .",
    "the mass eigenstates are obtained by rotating the component fields as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively two cp - even , one cp - odd and charged higgs bosons , and @xmath21 the eight parameters @xmath22@xmath7 and @xmath23@xmath8 are replaced by the vev @xmath24 , the mixing angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the higgs boson masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the soft @xmath1 breaking parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling constants of the cp - even higgs bosons with weak gauge bosons @xmath30 and @xmath31 are proportional to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath34 , only @xmath17 couples to the gauge bosons while @xmath18 decouples .",
    "we concentrate on this limit ( the sm - like limit ) where @xmath17 behaves as the sm higgs boson  @xcite .    imposing the transformation under the @xmath1 parity for leptons and quarks as , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "we could write down the type - x yukawa interaction  @xcite ; @xmath40    in the type - x thdm , more than @xmath41 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay into pairs of tau leptons for @xmath42 in the sm - like limit ; @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the neutral higgs bosons would be produced in pair by @xmath44 process at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and by @xmath45 process at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "these higgs bosons predominantly decay into a four-@xmath46 state , @xmath47 , which is the characteristic signal of the type - x thdm . there would be a clear signature in the dimuon channel from the direct decay of the higgs bosons , @xmath48 .",
    "although the number of events is only @xmath49 of the four tau lepton channel , this channel would be important to measure the mass of the higgs bosons at the lhc .",

    "@xmath19 in thdms depend on the type of the yukawa interaction . in the type - ii thdm with large @xmath26",
    ", stronger mass bounds can be obtained from these production processes at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite . however , if the yukawa interaction is the lepton specific which is realized in the wide parameter space in the type - x thdm , these higgs bosons are less constrained due to the relatively weak yukawa interaction with quarks . the search for such higgs bosons at the lep experiments",
    "is found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in our analysis , we use the collinear approximation to calculate the four momenta of the tau leptons@xcite .",
    "if tau leptons are energetic , the missing momentum from its decay would be along the direction of the charged track ( either a charged hadron ( hadrons ) or a charged lepton ) , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the momenta of the neutrino and the charged track , respectively",
    ". the proportionality constant @xmath53 can be determined by fixing @xmath54 . accordingly , the momentum of the decaying tau lepton can be approximately reconstructed as @xmath55 , where @xmath16 is the momentum fraction of the charged track from the parent tau lepton .    at hadron colliders , the transverse components of the missing momentum @xmath56 can be measured as the negative sum of the visible momenta .",
    "assuming that the missing transverse momentum of the event is accounted solely by the missing particles in the decays of tau leptons , and applying the collinear approximation for two tau leptons , the missing transverse momentum can be expressed by the momenta of charged tracks , as @xmath57 .",
    "unknown parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 are determined by solving simultaneous equations . using the resulting values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the invariant mass of the tau lepton pair is related with that of the tau - jet pair as @xmath62 .    at @xmath63 colliders ,",
    "neutral higgs boson pair can be produced via @xmath64 , and the four momenta of the four tau leptons are completely solved  @xcite .",

    "for the lhc study , background events for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 processes where the weak bosons decay leptonically and hadronically , and @xmath76jets processes followed by leptonic decays of weak bosons are generated by pythia , where the decays of tau leptons are also handled by tauola .",
    "the total cross sections for these processes are given as @xmath77  pb , @xmath78  pb and @xmath79  nb , respectively for @xmath71 , @xmath75 and @xmath80+jets production processes by pythia .",
    "we identify the tau - jet candidates by the following criteria ; a jet with @xmath81  gev and @xmath82 which contains @xmath83 or @xmath84 charged hadrons in a small cone ( @xmath85 ) centered at the jet momentum direction with the transverse energy deposit to this small cone more than @xmath86 of the jet .    in order to evaluate the signal significance",

    "we here focus on the hadronic decay mode of all tau leptons . in general , the mixture of the hadronic and the leptonic decay modes can be analysed . and the significance can be improved by combining the all channels . in order to construct the invariant mass of the tau lepton pair from four tau leptons , we choose the combination of the opposite signed tau leptons which gives the highest @xmath94 pair .",
    "the signal events are dominant even at the pre - selection level .",
    "the statistical significance can be further optimized by using the kinematical cuts giving the much better @xmath95 ratio . in order to test the signal with @xmath96 ,",
    "we only need the integrated luminosity of about @xmath97 fb@xmath91 where we only use the @xmath98 channel .",

    ", the additional higgs bosons can be the tau lepton specific .",
    "such scalar bosons can be pair produced by the gauge interaction at the lhc and the ilc , and mainly decay into tau leptons in the wide range of the parameter space . by using the collinear approximation",
    ", we show that multi - tau lepton final state @xmath99 at the lhc and @xmath100 at the ilc can be a clean signal . the tau lepton specific higgs boson can be tested at the lhc with about @xmath101 fb@xmath91 of the integrated luminosity for @xmath96 .",
    "although the huge integrated luminosity is required , the precise mass determination is possible by extracting the primary muon from the higgs boson decay in the @xmath65 channel .",
    "the search potential of the ilc with @xmath98 channel is about @xmath102 times better than that of the lhc with the @xmath65 channel in the sense of the integrated luminosity .",
