    "we deal with the coulomb potential of a system of point charges placed at the vertices of a planar polygonal linkage .",
    "the ultimate goal is to establish the possibility of controlling the shape of a pentagonal linkage by varying the values of two charges at the vertices . following a paradigm developed in our previous paper @xcite we consider coulomb potential as a meromorphic function on the planar moduli space of linkage and",
    "investigate its critical points .",
    "the basic assumption and motivation for accepting such an approach is that a vertex - charged linkage subject only to coulomb interaction of its charged vertices should take the shape with the minimal coulomb potential .",
    "the approach developed in @xcite was suggested by some recent research concerned with the control of nanosystems and other systems with several degrees of freedom @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this setting suggests several aspects and problems . in the present paper , we concentrate on the following scenario .",
    "given a convex planar configuration of linkage , we wish to find the vertex charges such that the global minimum of the arising coulomb potential is achieved at the given configuration .",
    "such a collection of charges will be said to _ stabilize _ the given configuration .",
    "we prove that any convex configuration of pentagonal linkage has a stabilizing system of charges which depends continuously on the configuration .",
    "this allows one to navigate any ( initial ) convex configuration to any other ( target ) convex configuration along any prescribed path in the space of convex configurations .",
    "we will refer to this situation by saying that a pentagonal linkage admits a _",
    "complete coulomb control_.    we wish to add that this research arose as a natural continuation of our previous joint results on morse functions on moduli spaces of polygonal linkages @xcite , @xcite .",

    "is a formula for the partial derivatives of cayley - menger determinant ( theorem [ thmcayleymenger ] ) which seems interesting for its own sake and provides one of our main technical tools .",
    "section [ sectionquadri ] briefly sketches an outline of the proof of the coulomb control for quadrilateral linkages . in a sense , it is a prologue which introduces the approach to be used for pentagonal linkages in the subsequent sections .",
    "in section [ localminsection ] we charge a pentagonal linkage by a five - tuple of positive charges @xmath0 .",
    "we prove that for any collection of charges , the coulomb potential has a unique critical point ( which is the minimum point ) in the space of convex configurations .",
    "in section [ pentcontrolsection ] we control a pentagonal linkage by just two positive charges .",
    "this means that we put charges @xmath1 , assuming that @xmath2 are some fixed positive charges , and that we can vary @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we prove that for any convex configuration @xmath5 there exists a unique stabilizing pair of positive charges @xmath6 .",

    "`` this is an important formula concerning the cayley - menger determinant .",
    "this formula is only valid when restricting to planar configurations .",
    "the minus sign in equation is not included in dziobek s original paper @xcite nor in several later works that utilize the cayley - menger determinant .",
    "however , checking equation on the square configuration indicates the need for the minus sign .",
    "the correct formula appears in the doctoral thesis of hampton @xcite '' .",
    "we actually use it only in the coplanar case for describing relations between diagonals of polygons .",
    "however we presented the proof of a more general statement for completeness and convenience of the reader more so that @xcite does not seem to be easily accessible .",
    "placing a collection of point charges @xmath46 at the vertices @xmath47 of a configuration and considering the coulomb potential of these charges we get a function defined on @xmath11 .",
    "we will refer to this setting by speaking of a _ vertex - charged linkage _ with the system of charges @xmath48 .",
    "recall that the coulomb potential @xmath49 of a system of point charges @xmath50 placed at the points @xmath51 of euclidean plane @xmath12 is defined as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the distance between the @xmath54-th and @xmath55-th points .",
    "since we are only interested in critical points of coulomb potential , addition of a constant makes no difference . by the very definition of polygonal linkage",
    ", the distances corresponding to two consequent vertices in formula ( [ coulomb ] ) remain the same for all configurations of linkage .",
    "hence their sum is constant for any fixed collection of charges for our purposes it is sufficient to work with the _ effective _ coulomb potential @xmath56 defined as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the length of diagonal between ( non - neighboring ) @xmath54-th and @xmath55-th vertices of the configuration .",
    "we say that a collection of charges _ stabilizes _ the configuration @xmath5 if @xmath56 attains at @xmath5 its minimal value .",
    "in this case we say that @xmath5 is _ the minimum point _ of @xmath56 .",
    "we explicate now the setting and notation in the cases considered in the sequel . for @xmath59",
    ", we put one positive charge @xmath4 at the first vertex .",
    "the rest three vertex - charges are @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 , we put two positive charges @xmath3 and @xmath4 at any two non - neighboring vertices and say that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are _ controlling charges_. the rest three charges are some fixed positive numbers .    it is proven in @xcite that , for positive charges @xmath62 , the global minimum of @xmath56 on the moduli space @xmath11 belongs to @xmath63 .",
    "as a visual illustration of the paradigm we briefly recall the main results of @xcite . for a quadrilateral linkage , we put charges equal to @xmath64 at three vertices , whereas the fourth vertex is charged by @xmath4 . then we have @xmath65    the following facts were established in @xcite :    1 .   for a given convex quadrilateral @xmath66",
    ", there exists a unique @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is a critical point for this charge . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is positive .",
    "2 .   for a quadrilateral linkage",
    ", @xmath56 has a unique minimum in @xmath63 .",
    "this means that , for a quadrilateral linkage , we have a complete control of convex configurations by point charges at its vertices .",
    "the `` picture of what happens '' which is behind the proofs of @xcite is such .",
    "the configuration space of a quadrilateral is a circle , and therefore the relation between the diagonals is important since both diagonals appear in @xmath56 .",
    "we remind that four points @xmath30 are coplanar whenever their cayley - menger determinant vanishes .",
    "therefore the squared diagonals @xmath67 of the quadrilateral are related by a cubic equation @xmath68 .",
    "the equation defines a real elliptic curve lying in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "it contains two connected components : one is unbounded and the other one is a convex closed curve , which we denote by @xmath70 . we make use of the mapping @xmath71 @xmath72 which maps a configuration of the linkage to the point in the plane whose coordinates are squared diagonals .",
    "the configuration space is mapped to the bounded component of the elliptic curve , whereas the space of convex configuration is bijectively mapped to some arc of the curve @xmath70 .",
    "the rest of the proof from @xcite uses the idea of convexity .",
    "namely , we can consider @xmath56 as a convex function defined on the @xmath69-plane .",
    "we are interested in its restriction to the arc of the convex curve @xmath70 .",
    "the restriction of a convex function to a convex curve is ( in general case ) not necessarily convex . but in our case , due to the specific position of the gradient @xmath73 with respect to the mentioned arc , and with a special parametrization , the restriction is a convex function , and therefore has a unique critical point which is the minimum .    in section [ localminsection ]",
    "we apply a similar approach : we introduce a mapping @xmath74 from the configuration space of a pentagonal linkage to the space @xmath75 by mapping a configuration to its squared diagonals .",
    "the image is a 2-dimensional manifold with corners , which appears to be the intersection of convex hypersurfaces .",
    "now we assume that we are given a polygonal 5-bar linkage @xmath7 with the vertices denoted by @xmath76 , as in the previous section .",
    "we also adopt notations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 from the previous section .",
    "since it is a linkage , we now assume that the sidelengths @xmath79 are fixed .",
    "let @xmath80 be the ( effective ) coulomb potential of the positively charged linkage @xmath7 .",
    "here we denote @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of all convex configurations of @xmath7 .",

    "the rest of the section is devoted to the proof of this theorem .",
    "a _ k - slice _ @xmath82 with respect to the diagonal @xmath83 is the set of all ( convex ) configurations such that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is some constant .",
    "each slice is an analytic curve homeomorphic to either a line segment or a point .",
    "there are exactly two slices , called _ terminals _ which are points .",

    "the restriction of the potential @xmath87 has no critical points",
    ". then the minimum value is achieved at the boundary of the slice .    in any case , the minimum point of the restricted potential is unique and depends continuously on @xmath85 .",
    "now we pass from one particular slice to the set of all convex configurations .    on each of the slices",
    ", we mark the minimum point of @xmath87 .",
    "taken together for all slices the marked points form the _ polar curve _",
    "@xmath88 of the potential @xmath56 with respect to the diagonal @xmath83 .",

    "its endpoints are the terminals .",
    "the polar curve may also contain some segments lying on the boundary of @xmath23 .",
    "the intersection of the polar curve with the interior part @xmath16 is a finite set of connected components @xmath92 .    since all critical points of @xmath56 belong to the polar curve , to prove theorem [ thmuniquemin ] it suffices to show that @xmath93 has a single critical point in @xmath89 .",
    "[ lemmaalmostthmuniquemin ] the potential @xmath93 has a unique critical point in each of the connected components @xmath92 of the polar curve @xmath89 .    with these ingredients at hand , we are ready to prove the main result .",
    "let us start with the most symmetric case : the equilateral linkage and equal charges .",
    "we prove that @xmath56 has a unique critical point in @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , each slice @xmath86 contains an axial symmetric configuration , that is , there exists a convex polygon @xmath94 such that :    @xmath95    @xmath96    by symmetry reasons , @xmath97 is a critical point , and therefore , ( the unique ) minimum point of the potential @xmath56 restricted to @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath86 is not a terminal point , the critical point lies in the relative interior of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , for this particular case , the polar curve lies in the space @xmath16 , and by proposition [ lemmaalmostthmuniquemin ] we obtain the result for the equilateral pentagon and equal charges .    for an arbitrary pentagonal linkage @xmath7 and arbitrary ( positive ) charges , we use reductio ad absurdum .",
    "assume that @xmath89 has more than one component , and @xmath56 has more than one critical points .",
    "we start continuously deforming the lengths and the charges aiming to the above symmetric linkage .",
    "let us inspect the behavior of the critical points during the deformation . during this process",
    "all objects change continuously : the spaces @xmath11 and @xmath16 , the slices @xmath86 , the curve @xmath89 and the critical points .",
    "the number of components of @xmath89 can increase , but also decrease ( as soon as the polar curve crosses the boundary ) . in the beginning of the deformation we have more than one critical points , whereas at the end the critical point is unique .",
    "the confluence of critical points can not happen in the interior , since then two branches of @xmath89 have to be connected , but the limits of the critical points are distinct on that new branch unless they meet at the boundary .",
    "however two critical points on one branch is impossible by proposition [ lemmaalmostthmuniquemin ] .",
    "moreover , it is proven in @xcite that @xmath56 has no critical points on the boundary of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that change of the number of critical points is not possible , so from the beginning we have only one critical point which is the minimum .",
    "for a generic pentagonal linkage , we put charges @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the vertices 5 and 3 respectively . for this case",
    "we have @xmath98    now we wish to understand whether two charges can provide a complete control of convex pentagons .",
    "we begin with presenting a simple but conceptually important general observation valid for arbitrary polygonal linkages .",
    "this observation makes essential use of the specific form of coulomb interaction and underlies much of the further discussion .",
    "[ lemmageorge ] for any @xmath99-gonal linkage @xmath7 and any configuration @xmath66 , the stabilizing charges for @xmath5 are solutions to a system of @xmath100 quadratic equations in @xmath99 unknowns with the coefficients algebraically expressible through the lengths @xmath58 of the diagonals of @xmath5 .    proof .",
    "the proof is obtained by a standard use of the lagrange multipliers method for constrained optimization of @xmath56 as a function of diagonals @xmath58 . in our case the number of variables @xmath58 is equal to @xmath101 .",
    "it is also easy to see that the number of independent constraints @xmath102 given by the cayley - menger relations for the diagonals is equal to @xmath103 . following prescriptions of the lagrange method we consider a @xmath104 functional matrix @xmath105 having the gradient of target function @xmath106 as the first row , and gradients of constraints @xmath102 as the remaining rows .",
    "notice that the values of charges @xmath107 appear only in the first row .    according to lagrange criterion a system of charges @xmath108",
    "yields a constrained critical point of @xmath56 on @xmath11 if and only if the rank of @xmath105 is not maximal . in other words ,",
    "all @xmath109-minors of @xmath105 should vanish at point @xmath5 which gives us a system of algebraic equations @xmath110 for @xmath108 each of which is of degree not exceeding two . by linear algebra",
    "the number of independent equations in the system @xmath110 is equal to @xmath100 .",
    "the statement about coefficients can be verified directly .    for a given @xmath111 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath112 the set of solutions to @xmath110 , i.e. the set of all charges stabilizing @xmath5 .",
    "for obvious reasons , one may await that generically @xmath112 is three - dimensional and it is easy to see that this is true for @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , in this case we have just one homogeneous quadratic equation in four unknowns @xmath46 of the form @xmath113 .",
    "it follows that the solution set @xmath112 is a cone over the one - sheeted two - dimensional hyperboloid .",
    "we add that similar results can be obtained for @xmath114 using a general method for geometric and topological investigation of intersections of real quadrics developed in @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the structure of @xmath112 can vary from point to point , which makes it unclear how to navigate from one configuration to another one . developing effective navigation",
    "would be easier if the sets of available charges were finite .",
    "for dimensional reasons the number of solutions to @xmath110 may be finite if we reduce the number of unknowns ( charges ) to @xmath100 .",
    "so it becomes natural to suggest that coulomb control should be possible if the number of controlling charges is @xmath100 , which will be assumed from now . in this setting proposition [ lemmageorge ]",
    "yields a modified system @xmath115 and a universal upper estimate for the number of stabilizing charges which follows merely from bezout theorem .",
    "[ estimate ] if @xmath112 is finite then the number of stabilizing charges for @xmath5 does not exceed @xmath116 .    examining the structure of system @xmath117",
    "we conclude that if @xmath112 is finite then its cardinality in fact does not exceed two .",
    "the reason is that if the controlling charges are not neighboring then the system @xmath117 consists of one linear and one quadratic equation . in this case",
    "explicit expressions for the coefficients can be found in section ( [ theoremdirkproof ] ) .",
    "moreover , if we only consider convex pentagons with two controlling charges then it turns out that there exists exactly one pair of positive charges stabilizing @xmath5 , which is the desired situation for our purposes . to prove the latter fact we need one more lemma .",

    "the corresponding algorithm to connect @xmath131 and @xmath132 can be described more precisely as follows .",
    "first , we calculate the starting and target stabilizing charges @xmath137 and @xmath138 using formulae coming from the proof of theorem [ theoremdirkproof ] in section 6.4 .",
    "next , we choose a path joining @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the control space @xmath139 .",
    "so if we continuously change the values of stabilizing charges along the chosen path the configuration will move to the target configuration through convex configurations without meeting a bifurcation point .",
