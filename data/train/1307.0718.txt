    "the bright star in the globular cluster 47 tuc ( ngc  104 ) is the cluster s brightest member at both optical @xcite and ultraviolet @xcite wavelengths .",
    "this blue giant ( b8 iii ) is a post - asymptotic giant - branch ( post - agb ) star : having ascended the agb and ejected its outer envelope , it is moving across the color - magnitude diagram toward the tip of the white - dwarf cooling sequence . @xcite observed the star with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they found that , while a @xcite model adequately reproduces the stellar spectrum across most of the hut bandpass ( 900  1850  ) , it vastly overpredicts the stellar flux at wavelengths shorter than lyman @xmath0 ( 1026  ) . to determine the source of this opacity",
    ", we observed the star with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ; _",
    "@xcite ) . with a spectral resolution of 0.05  , _",
    "fuse _ can resolve features that are blended at the 3   resolution of hut . by fitting synthetic spectra to the star s _ fuse _ spectrum , we have determined that the peculiar structures in the stellar continuum are sculpted by resonances in the photoionization cross sections of excited - state neutral nitrogen in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the bright star in 47 tuc was observed through the 30  @xmath4 30  low - resolution ( lwrs ) aperture of _ fuse _ for 12,324 s on 2006 june 07 ( data set g0730101 ) .",
    "archival nuv images of 47 tuc obtained with the ultraviolet imaging telescope @xcite confirm that no other uv - bright stars fell within the spectrograph aperture .",
    "the data were reduced using version 3.2 of the calfuse calibration pipeline @xcite . for each channel ,",
    "the spectra from individual exposures were shifted to a common wavelength scale , weighted by their exposure time , and averaged .",
    "the spectra were binned by four detector pixels , or about 0.025   , approximately half of the instrument resolution .",
    "the complete spectrum was spliced together from the available channels .",
    "the intensities of the hut and _ fuse _ spectra differ by 4% in the region of overlap , consistent with the uncertainties in the flux calibration of each instrument . for the figures in this paper ,",
    "the spectra were smoothed by an additional three spectral bins .",
    "we employ the lte model atmospheres of @xcite and the synthetic - spectral code synspec @xcite to model the bright star s _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we adopt the atmospheric parameters derived from the hut spectrum ( @xmath5 = 11,000 k ; @xmath6 = 2.5 ; [ m / h ] = -1.0 ) , but use the castelli & kurucz @xmath7-enhanced models , for which the abundances of o , he , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti are enhanced by + 0.4 dex over the scaled - solar values , consistent with the measured abundances of giant stars in 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "these models assume a plane - parallel , homogeneous , and stationary stellar atmosphere in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium . given a model atmosphere and a line list , synspec solves the radiative transfer equation and computes a synthetic stellar spectrum .",
    "all models assume local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "it is possible to modify the atmospheric abundances within synspec , but for simplicity we adopt the values used to generate the model atmosphere .    within synspec ,",
    "atomic species may be treated either explicitly or implicitly .",
    "explicit atoms contribute to the continuum opacity through bound - free transitions from all specified energy levels and free - free transitions from all specified ions .",

    "for each explicit ion , a data file must be supplied to the program .",
    "we employ the data files developed for b - type stars by @xcite .",

    "its mean flux is @xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 @xmath14 .",
    "we scale the synthetic spectrum to match the observed flux in this region .",
    "this scale factor is applied to all of the models discussed below .",
    "our initial model is presented in the first panel of fig .",

    "the black curve represents the observed spectrum .",
    "the emission feature at 989   is geocoronal .",
    "the red curve represents the synthetic spectrum constructed by synspec , computed and scaled as described above .",
    "the normalized green spectrum represents interstellar absorption features , which are included in the stellar model .",
    "the model significantly overpredicts the stellar flux in the region between lyman @xmath15 ( 973  ) and lyman @xmath0 ( 1026  ) .",
    "note , in particular , the sharp breaks in the stellar spectrum at 995 and 1010   and the broad absorption trough between 1005 and 1010  .",
    "the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuse ] presents the photoionization cross - sections as a function of wavelength ( black curve ) for the first excited state of  ( 2s@xmath1 2p@xmath2 @xmath1d@xmath3 ) computed by the opacity project ( op ; see @xcite for a general overview ) .",
    "we see that the sharp breaks and broad troughs in the stellar spectrum correspond to resonances in the photoionization cross sections .",
    "these resonances are more obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig_cross_sections ] , which presents op cross sections for the first ( upper panel ) and second ( lower panel ) excited states of .",
    "the @xcite atomic models employ op cross sections , but use resonance - averaged values ( red curves in both figures ) , which can not reproduce the observed structure . while the resonances shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fuse ] are relatively broad , many others are unresolved by the op calculations @xcite .",
    "smoothed cross sections are sufficient for modeling the opacity in stellar atmospheres , the purpose for which these atomic models were constructed .    to overcome this shortcoming , we insert the op cross sections at full resolution into the atomic model for  ( using the recipe provided in the synspec users guide ) and generate a new synthetic spectrum ( third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuse ] ) .",
    "while the model changes only slightly , we do note the appearance of a broad absorption feature between 1005 and 1010  .",
    "finally , we increase the nitrogen abundance by a factor of 12 ( to 1.2 times the solar value ) and plot the result in the fourth panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuse ] .",
    "the general features of the stellar spectrum are now well reproduced , but their wavelengths are shifted by a few ngstroms .",
    "this is not surprising ; uncertainties of 2 to 3% in the energies of the op cross sections can shift the resonances from their observed wavelengths @xcite . @xcite have shown how resonances in the cross sections of  can shift due to small variations in their computed energies . between our initial and final models , the integrated flux between 972 and 1026   falls by a factor of two .    to reproduce the observed spectrum",
    ", the model requires a super - solar nitrogen abundance .",
    "how does this value compare with that derived from bound - bound transitions in the stellar spectrum ? to reduce the impact of non - lte effects on our analysis @xcite , we have identified four uncontaminated features due to absorption by the first excited state of  ( the same state that is responsible for the resonances discussed above ) , at 1165.6 , 1169.7 , 1176.5 , and 1176.6  .",
    "they yield n / h ratios between 0.4 and 0.6 times the solar value , about half the value derived from the bound - free continuum .",
    "this result suggests that the  cross sections predicted by the op calculations are too small by a factor of two .",
    "one caveat : as discussed below , bound - free transitions of  depress the stellar continuum at wavelengths shorter than 1100  , so uncertainties in the carbon abundance may also be at play .",
    "we can not use ground - state transitions to constrain the star s photospheric nitrogen abundance , as their spectral features are blended with strong ism lines",
    ". a nitrogen abundance of half the solar value is not unreasonable for this object .",
    "@xcite find that n / h ranges from 0.15 to 5 times solar among main - sequence stars in 47  tuc .",
    "as discussed below , we expect the nitrogen abundance of a post - agb star to be twice that of a main - sequence object .",
    "another feature can be explained by bound - free absorption from the second excited state of  ( 2s@xmath1 2p@xmath2 @xmath1p@xmath3 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_1072 ] , the black curve represents the observed spectrum , while the red curve represents our model .",
    "the model includes op cross sections for the second excited state of , again at full resolution , and assumes a nitrogen abundance n / h of 1.2 times the solar value .",
    "the broad absorption feature seen near 1072   in the data is shifted by about 8   in the model .",
    "this shift corresponds to an energy error of less than 1% , well within the uncertainty of the op calculations .",
    "both the anomalous opacity and the peculiar absorption pattern seen in the fuv spectrum of the bright star in 47 tuc are due to resonances in the photoionization cross sections of  in the first excited state . including this opacity in the model , by employing op cross sections at their full resolution and raising the model s nitrogen abundance ,",
    "reduces the model flux by a factor of two and reproduces the broad absorption troughs centered at 995 and 1008  .",
    "a second absorption feature centered near 1072   can be reproduced by including opacity from  in the second excited state , though the model feature is offset in wavelength .",
    "the importance of photoionization resonances in the uv spectra of late - b through f - type stars has been explored by @xcite , who computed bound - free cross sections of  and used them to model resonances in the _ iue _ spectrum of the ap si star hd  34452 .",
    "photoionization resonances have been identified in the euv spectrum of the white dwarf gd  246 @xcite and the x - ray spectra of several x - ray binaries @xcite .    as a simple test of the importance of nitrogen opacity in population i giants",
    ", we generated a synthetic spectrum using a model atmosphere with the same temperature and gravity as the bright star , but with solar metallicity .",
    "the spectrum shows almost no flux at wavelengths shorter than 1100  ; the continuum is obliterated by bound - free absorption from ground - state atomic carbon .",
    "only when the carbon abundance is reduced to a fraction of the solar value is the fuv continuum bright enough to reveal nitrogen resonance absorption .    according to stellar evolutionary theory , a star s arrival on the red - giant branch",
    "is accompanied by a deepening of its convective envelope , which brings the ashes of hydrogen burning to the stellar surface .",
    "this process , known as first dredge - up , doubles the surface @xmath16n abundance , reduces the @xmath17c abundance by about 30% , and leaves the abundance of @xmath18o unchanged @xcite .",
    "no further mixing is predicted for the low - mass stars present in globular clusters today .    the bright star in 47",
    "tuc may be the ideal candidate to exhibit strong resonances of atomic nitrogen .",
    "as a post - agb star in a globular cluster , it combines the high nitrogen abundance necessary to carve these features in its fuv spectrum with the low carbon abundance necessary to reveal them .",
