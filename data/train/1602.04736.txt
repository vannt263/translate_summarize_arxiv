    "ceres is the largest and most massive body in the asteroid main belt .",
    "while many other large bodies of similar composition such as pallas , hygiea , euphrosyne have asteroid families , no such group has been so far identified for ceres @xcite . yet",
    "collisional models suggest that about 10 craters larger than 10 km in diameter should have formed over 4.55 gyr of collisional evolution in the main belt @xcite . also",
    ", observational data from the dawn probe show that at least two @xmath0280-km sized craters were formed in the last @xmath1 gyr on ceres surface , and larger impacts may have happened in the past @xcite .",
    "the absence of a ceres family is therefore a major mystery in asteroid dynamics @xcite .",
    "previous works have suggested the possibility that the outer shell of ceres could have been rich in ice , and that family members could have sublimated or been eroded by collisional evolution on timescales of hundreds of millions of years @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has also been hypothesized that km - sized fragments ejected at ceres escape velocity would likely disintegrate @xcite .",
    "results from the dawn mission set however an upper limit of 40% in the ice content of ceres outer shell @xcite , which seems too low to explain the lack of a family .    in this work we argue that the unique nature of ceres as a dwarf planet may have indeed produced families not easily detectable using methods calibrated for smaller , less massive bodies .",
    "close encounters and linear secular resonances with ceres are expected to have significantly depleted the orbital region in the near proximity of this body , so reducing the number of the closest ceres neighbors .",
    "more importantly , initial ejection velocities should have been significantly larger than those observed for any other parent body in the main belt , including vesta , spreading the collision fragments in a much larger area .",
    "members of the ceres family would be significantly more distant among themselves than the typical distances between objects formed in collisions from smaller bodies , making an identification of the ceres family quite challenging .    rather than looking for members of a ceres group in the central main belt ,",
    "the region of the main belt with the highest concentration of asteroids , and where two other large ch families , dora and chloris , @xcite , would make the taxonomical identification of former members of a ceres family or paleo - family ( an old dispersed family with an age between 2.7 and 3.8 gyr , @xcite ) difficult , in this work we suggest to search for ch - type objects in the pristine region of the main belt , between the 5j:-2a and 7j:-3a mean - motion resonances ( or between 2.825 and 2.960 au in proper semi - major axis ) .",
    "this region of the asteroid belt was depleted of asteroids during the late heavy bombardment ( lhb hereafter ) phase by sweeping mean - motion resonances , and the two mean - motion resonances with jupiter have since limited the influx of outside material from other areas of the asteroid belt @xcite",
    ". the lower density of asteroids and the lack of other major c - type families at eccentricities and inclinations comparable to those of ceres makes the identification of possible members of the ceres family an easier task in this region .",
    "identifying concentrations of c - type objects at values of inclinations comparable with that of ceres itself could therefore be a strong circumstantial evidence about the formation of a ceres family in the past .",
    "ceres is the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt .",
    "while its mass is not large enough to clear its orbital neighborhood , significant dynamical perturbations are expected from this body , either as a consequence of close encounters @xcite or because of linear secular resonances involving the precession frequency of ceres node @xmath2 or pericenter @xmath3 , and those of a given asteroid @xcite . to investigate the importance of ceres as a perturber",
    ", we obtain proper elements for 1400 particles in the plane of proper semi - major axis and inclination @xmath4 , with the approach described in @xcite , based on the method for obtaining synthetic proper elements of @xcite .",
    "we integrated the particles over 20 myr under the gravitation influence of i ) all planets and ii ) all planets plus ceres as a massive body  kg , as determined by the dawn spacecraft @xcite . ] with @xmath5 , the symplectic integrator based on @xmath6 from the _ swift _ package of @xcite , and modified by @xcite to include online filtering of osculating elements .",
    "the initial osculating elements of the particles went from 2.696 to 2.832  au in @xmath7 and from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in @xmath10 .",
    "we used 35 intervals in @xmath7 and 40 in @xmath10 .",
    "the other orbital elements of the test particles were set equal to those of ceres at the modified julian date of 57200 .",
    "[ fig : map_central ] displays our results , as two dynamical maps .",
    "each blue dot is associated with a particle proper @xmath4 value . for the case without ceres as a massive body , displayed in panel a , the orbital region near ceres is relatively stable .",
    "the only important non - linear secular resonance in the region is the @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 , in terms of linear secular resonances ) .",
    "objects whose pericenter frequency is within @xmath13 arcsec / yr from @xmath14 arcsec / yr , likely resonators in the terminology of @xcite , are shown as red full dots in this figure .",
    "this is a diffusive secular resonance , and asteroids captured into this resonance may drift away , but will not be destabilize @xcite .",
    "the situation is much different and more interesting for the map with ceres as a massive body .    as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_central ] , panel b , accounting for ceres causes the appearance of a 1:1 mean - motion resonance with this dwarf planet .",
    "most importantly , linear secular resonances of nodes @xmath15 and pericenter @xmath16 , first detected by @xcite significantly destabilize the orbits in the proximity of ceres . combined with the long - term effect of close encounters with ceres , this has interesting consequences for the survival of members of the ceres family in the central main belt .",
    "not many family members are expected to survive near ceres , and this would cause significant difficulties in using standard dynamical family identification techniques , since they are based on looking for pairs of neighbors in proper element domains ( hierarchical clustering method , hcm hereafter , @xcite ) .",
    "since the close neighbors of ceres would have been removed on a short timescale , only objects whose distance from ceres is higher than the average distance between pairs of asteroids in the central main belt would have survived .",
    "also , the area at higher inclination than that associated with the linear secular resonances with ceres should be significantly depleted of asteroids , and this is actually observed ( see for instance fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the dora family , a large ( @xmath17 members , @xcite ) group of the same spectral type of ceres , ch , is located at lower inclinations than that of ceres . considering that the large ch chloris family is also encountered in the central main belt near ceres , discriminating between a ch asteroid from ceres and one from dora , chloris , or other local sources would be a very daunting task , also considering that there are currently no identified members of a ceres family that could serve as a basis for a taxonomical analysis .    to further investigate the efficiency of ceres in perturbing its most immediate neighbors",
    ", we also performed numerical simulations of a fictitious ceres family with the @xmath18 integrator ( swift@xmath19yarkovsky@xmath19stochastic yorp@xmath19close encounters ) of @xcite , modified to also account for past changes in the values of the solar luminosity .",
    "this integrators accounts for both the diurnal and seasonal version of the yarkovsky effect , the stochastic version of the yorp effect , and close encounters of massless particles with massive bodies .",
    "the numerical set - up of our simulations was similar to what discussed in @xcite : we used the optimal values of the yarkovsky parameters discussed in @xcite for c - type asteroids , the initial spin obliquity was random , and normal reorientation timescales due to possible collisions as described in @xcite were considered for all runs .",
    "we integrated our test particles under the influence of all planets ( case a ) , and all planets plus ceres ( case b ) , and obtained synthetic proper elements with the approach described in @xcite .",
    "the fictitious ceres family was generated with the approach described in @xcite : we assumed that the initial ejection velocity field follows an isotropical gaussian distribution of zero mean and standard deviation given by :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the body diameter in km , and @xmath22 is a parameter describing the width of the velocity field .",
    "we used the relatively small value of @xmath23  m / s for our simulated family . in the next section",
    "we will discuss why it is quite likely that any possible ceres family would have a much larger value of @xmath22 .",
    "since here , however , we were interested in the dynamics in the proximity of ceres itself , our choice of @xmath22 was , in our opinion , justified .",
    "we generated 642 particles with size - frequency distributions ( sfd ) with an exponent @xmath24 that best - fitted the cumulative distribution equal to 3.6 , a fairly typical value @xcite , and with diameters in the range from 2.0 to 12.0 km .",
    "[ fig : ceres_scatter ] displays our results in the proper @xmath4 plane for the simulation without ceres as a massive body ( panel a ) and with a massive ceres ( panel b ) .",
    "black full dots display the position of simulated ceres family members at the beginning of the simulation , after 1.2 my , while the red full dots show the orbital location at the end of the integration , for @xmath25  my . for the case without ceres one can notice that the family does not disperse much , and that most of the scattering is caused by the 3j:-1s:1a three - body resonance .",
    "results including ceres as a perturber are quite more interesting : already after just 1.2 my secular resonances with ceres cleared a gap near the orbital location of the dwarf planet , identified by a full blue dot .",
    "the situation is even more dramatic at the end of the simulation , where we observe that ceres scattered material at lower and higher inclinations with respect to the case in which ceres had no mass , and opened a significant gap at the family center , as also observed in the dynamical map of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_central ] , panel b.     as a function of time of the simulated family members for the case without ( blue line ) and with ( red line ) ceres as a massive body .",
    "the horizontal black line displays the maximum nominal distance cutoff level @xmath26 for the whole simulated ceres family.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    how difficult would be to identify our simulated ceres family using hcm ? to answer this question , we computed the nominal distance velocity cutoff @xmath26 for which two nearby asteroids are considered to be related using the approach of @xcite , that defines this quantity as the average minimum distance between all possible asteroid pairs , as a function of time , for i ) all paired asteroids in the simulated ceres family ( @xmath26 ) , and ii ) just with respect to ceres itself ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this latter quantity provides an estimate of the minimum value of distance cutoff needed to identify a ceres family using the standard hcm .",
    "the maximum value of the nominal distance velocity cutoff for the simulated ceres family was equal to 17.7  m / s . when ceres was not considered as a massive body , values of @xmath27 were of the order of 5  m / s , at all times below the nominal distance velocity cutoff ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_ceres ] , blue line ) .",
    "once ceres was included as a massive body , however , values of @xmath27 quickly surpassed the nominal distance velocity cutoff @xmath26 ( see red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_ceres ] ) : after 200 my , except of short episodes in which @xmath28 , for most of the time @xmath27 was larger than @xmath26 .",
    "after 380 my , this trend was consolidated and @xmath27 was always larger than @xmath26 .",
    "the identification of a ceres family using hcm in the domain of proper elements of the simulated family and ceres as the first body would be quite challenging after 380 my .",
    "so , where to look for hypothetical surviving members of a ceres family ?",
    "the next section will be dealing with estimating the extent of the initial orbital dispersion of a putative family , and in assessing the regions where locating its members could be easier .",
    "the escape velocity @xmath29 from ceres is considerably larger than that of other , less massive bodies : @xmath30 m / s @xcite versus the 360 m / s for vesta @xcite , the largest body in the main belt with a uncontroversial recognized asteroid family .",
    "the vesta family is one of the largest in the main belt , and one would expect a putative ceres family to be even larger .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the shape of the ejection velocity field of 49 asteroid families .",
    "typical observed values of @xmath31 , with @xmath22 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : std_vej ] , are between 0.5 and 1.5 ( see also @xcite , sect . 5 ) and",
    "argument of pericenter @xmath32 , and on the impact geometry , family members may have not reached the pristine region . for simplicity ,",
    "in this work we concentrated our analysis on large basins forming events .",
    "however , since collisional models predict that about 10 400 km or larger craters could have formed on ceres @xcite , we expect that , at least for a fraction of these events , some of the ejected material was likely to have reached the pristine region . ] . while for typical asteroid families this implies that @xmath22 is generally lower than 100 m / s , even a conservative choice of @xmath33 for ceres would produce a field with @xmath22 of the order of 240 m / s . this is more than a factor of 2 larger than the higher values of @xmath22 observed for some of the oldest asteroid families @xcite , but not inconsistent with the observed presence of crater ray systems around large craters on ceres , such as occator @xcite , that cover a large portion of the ceres surface . since the circular velocity needed to form such rays",
    "is of the order of half the escape velocity from ceres , this suggests that values of @xmath34 near 0.5 for the @xmath22 parameter of a possible ceres family are not unreasonable .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , see also @xcite , we generated fictitious ceres asteroids members with diameters 1 , 3 , and 7  km with the minimum and maximum value of @xmath34 from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ceres_ej ] displays our results for @xmath35 ( panel a ) and @xmath36 ( panel b ) . even in the most conservative case of @xmath35 ,",
    "a value lower than those of any of the families studied in @xcite , we still found that a significative fraction and @xmath37  km populations , respectively .",
    "] of the multi - km ( and potentially observable ) fragments from ceres could have been injected in the pristine region of the main belt .",
    "we define this region as the area between the 5j:-2a and 7j:-3a mean - motion resonances with jupiter . because of these two dynamical barriers , very little material from external regions can reach this area @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the local density of asteroids is much inferior to that of other regions of the asteroid belt .",
    "also , only small c - type families , such those of naema ( 301 members ) , terpsichore ( 138 members ) , and terentia ( 79 members ) @xcite are found in the region , and at eccentricity values quite different than that of ceres , so easily distinguishable from putative ceres fragments .",
    "if any large ( @xmath38  km ) , not easily movable by non - gravitation effects , members of a hypothetical ceres family would have been injected in this region after the lhb , it would be reasonable to expect that they could have remained there and still be visible today .",
    "we selected a region in the pristine zone where most of the @xmath39  km objects could be found , according to our results for the most conservative case with @xmath35 ( black box in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceres_ej ] , panels a , this also corresponds to the region in which most of the @xmath40  km objects would be located in the most optimistic scenario of @xmath36 , see black box in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceres_ej ] , panels b. in the next section we will investigate if any such object could be identified in the pristine region .",
    "results of a dynamical map with ceres as a massive body , not shown for the sake of brevity , demonstrate that the pristine region at inclination close to that of ceres is dynamically stable , with no linear secular resonances with ceres and only minor diffusive secular resonances with the giant planets . in the black region of fig .",
    "[ fig : ceres_ej ] there are four ch asteroids , according to data from the three major photometric / spectroscopic surveys ( ecas ( eight - color asteroid analysis , @xcite ) , smass ( small main belt spectroscopic survey , @xcite ) , and s3os2 ( small solar system objects spectroscopic survey , @xcite ) : 195 eurykleia , 238 hypatia , 910 annelise , and 1189 terentia . the wise survey @xcite estimates that these objects have diameters of 85.7 , 148.5 .",
    "47.1 , and 55.9 km , respectively . with the possible and very doubtful exception of annelise and terentia ,",
    "the other objects are too big to be realistically assumed to be members of a ceres family . apart from a small family of 79 members around terentia @xcite , no major family has been identified around the largest objects , that appear to be isolated .",
    "to increase statistics , we turn our attention to photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey - moving object catalog data , fourth release ( sdss - moc4 hereafter , @xcite ) . using the classification method of @xcite in the @xmath41 slope and @xmath42 colors domain , we identified 23 c - type photometric candidates in the pristine region .",
    "[ fig : ceres_sdss_wise ] , panel a shows their orbital location in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "vertical red lines display the orbital location of the main mean - motion resonances in the region , including the 2j:1s:-1a three - body resonance that divides the pristine area in two parts .",
    "14 of the 23 sdss c - type asteroids , 60.9% of the total , can be found in the black region where we would expect ceres family members to be located .",
    "by contrast , only 6 objects can be found at lower inclinations , and only 3 at higher values .",
    "overall , c - type photometric candidates in the pristine region tend to cluster at inclination values close to that of ceres .",
    "to check the statistical significance of this result , we checked what would be the probability that these 14 asteroids were produced by a fluctuation of a poisson distribution ( it has been suggested that the orbital distribution of background asteroids follows a poisson distribution @xcite ) . following the approach of @xcite , the probability that the expected number of @xmath43 occurrences in a given interval is produced by the poissonian statistics",
    "is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a positive real number , equal to the expected number of occurrences in the given interval .",
    "here we used for @xmath45 the number of sdss candidates in the black region ( @xmath46 ) , weighted to account for the volume occupied by the region ( @xmath47 ) with respect to the total volume considered in our analysis ( @xmath48 , we considered asteroids with @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is given by :    @xmath50    for our considered black region , this yield @xmath51 , that corresponds to a probability to observe 14 bodies of just 0.13% , quite less than the null hypothesis level of 1.0% of the data being drawn from the poisson distribution .",
    "similar analysis performed for uniform and gaussian distributions ( see @xcite for details on the procedures ) also failed to fulfill the null hypothesis , which suggests that the observed concentration of asteroids at inclinations close to those of ceres should be statistically significant .    to increase the number of possible ceres members , we also look for objects in the wise database whose geometric albedo @xmath52 is between 0.08 and 0.10 , the range of albedo values observed for more than 90% of the surface material at ceres by the dawn spacecraft @xcite . while c - type objects with these values of wise albedo could be associated with a ceres family , other spectral types such as x , d , l , k , and even some s also have albedo values in this range , so this data must be considered with some caution .",
    "nevertheless , it provides useful preliminary information . after eliminating objects belonging to spectral types other than c ( 13 bodies ) , members of the terpsichore and terentia families ( 7 asteroids ) , and of the x - type group charis ( 5 objects ) ,",
    "we were left with a sample of 130 asteroids in that range of albedos .",
    "the fact that only 4 c - type candidates were members of the terpsichore family , and 3 of terentia , 3.2% of the total , seems to indicate that local sources may not explain all the local population of c - type candidates .",
    "since the other c - type objects in the region have diameters less than that of terpsichore , even if they produced families in the past ( of which there is no trace today ) , we would expect that to account at most for 10% of the observed population of c - type candidates .",
    "[ fig : ceres_sdss_wise ] , panel b , displays the @xmath4 distribution of these objects .",
    "again , 67 asteroids , 51.5% of the total , are found in the black region , while 39 , ( 30.0% ) are found at lower inclinations and 24 ( 18.5% ) at higher @xmath10 .",
    "22 of the objects at low inclinations cluster near the x - type family charis , and could quite possibly be associated with its halo .",
    "if we eliminate these objects , then the percentage of albedo candidates in the black region increase to 56.0% , a result similar to that from the sdss - moc4 data . to reduce possible contaminations from the local large families of charis , eos and koronis , which could have small populations of objects with wise albedos in the studied range , we eliminated objects i ) with @xmath7 beyond the 2j:1s:-1a mean - motion resonance that could potentially be associated with the charis and eos halo @xcite , and are less likely to have been produced by collisions on ceres with low values of @xmath34 , and ii ) those objects between the 5j:-2a and the 2j:1s:-1a mean - motion resonances with proper eccentricities lower than 0.08 and sine of proper inclinations lower than 0.06 , that could potentially be members of the koronis halo @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ceres_histpv ] shows a histogram of all the 133 c - type albedo candidates in the pristine region ( panel a ) , and of the 45 asteroids that satisfied our criteria ( panel b ) . in the first panel",
    "one can notice a peak at @xmath53 associated with the local charis x - type family , that is not visible once objects in the charis halo are removed ( panel b ) .",
    "remarkably , there is a peak in the @xmath54 distribution that nearly coincides with the current value of the inclination of ceres . to check for its statistical significance , and in particular",

    "resonances with ceres would have depleted the population of members at higher inclinations than ceres itself , and close encounters with the dwarf planet would also caused further spread of the family , making the identification of a ceres dynamical group impossible after timescales of 200 - 400 my .",
    "members of the ceres family at low inclinations would not be easily distinguishable from members of other local large ch families such as dora and chloris .",
    "* we investigated the original spread that a ceres family may have had in the @xmath63 proper element domain . assuming that values of the initial ejection velocity parameter @xmath64 , would be in the range observed for other families",

    "collisional models predict that about 10 such craters could have formed on ceres @xcite . while the largest well - defined basins observed by dawn on ceres surface are smaller than 300 km , there is topographical evidence that larger impact structures formed in the ancient past @xcite .",

    "remarkably , c - type candidates in this region cluster at inclinations that would be compatible with the range reached by possible ceres fragments . among albedo c - type candidates , we observe a statistically significant peak in the @xmath54 distribution at values close to that of ceres itself .",
    "the number of c - type candidates at lower and higher inclinations is significantly lower , and no significant local sources can produce the observed distribution of c - type candidates .    while we believe that we have provided a circumstantial evidence in favor of a possible ceres family in this work , we are aware that we have not proven its existence beyond any reasonable doubt . since ceres surface is characterized by a distinct @xmath66 absorption band @xcite , observing this feature in some of the proposed ceres family candidates could be a conclusive proof that such family exist , or existed in the past .",
