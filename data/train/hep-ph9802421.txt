    "the once conventional treatment of color in perturbative qcd calculations , i.e. , the color singlet model ( csm ) , has run into a serious impasse in describing the data on the production of charmonium states at the fermilab tevatron @xcite . specific proposals to solve this problem agree on the basic elements : i ) onium production is a two - step process where a heavy quark pair is produced first , followed by the nonperturbative formation of the asymptotic states , and ii ) color octet as well as singlet @xmath1 states contribute to the production of charmonia , as clearly demonstrated by the data @xcite . neglecting octet contributions is the source of the failure of the csm .",
    "two formalisms have been proposed to remedy this mistake .",
    "the basic assumption of the soft color approach @xcite is that no observable dynamics is associated with the soft processes that connect the color of the perturbative charm pair with the colorless charmonium bound state .",
    "this scheme , although far more restrictive than other proposals , successfully accommodates all features of charmonium and bottomonium production .",
    "the original qcd computations@xcite referred to it as the color evaporation model ( cem ) , and identified it as the most logical way to incorporate color constraints into perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "the data suggests it still is .",
    "it correctly predicts the energy and final state momentum dependence of charmonium and bottomonium hadro- and photoproduction at all energies , as well as their production in electron - positron colliders .",
    "it makes the sweeping prediction that @xmath2 s are produced unpolarized , a signature of the absence of dynamical final state effects .",
    "if such effects were discovered , there is a possible scheme , successful in the theoretical treatment of decays , to accommodate them : the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd or com , for color octet model ) @xcite . applying nrqcd to the bulk of the data has been a challenge and has , in fact , run into difficulties with recent hera data .    the measurement @xcite of the inelastic photoproduction of charmonium at high energy has triggered a new charmonium crisis .",
    "the csm , which qualitatively fails to describe the hadroproduction of charmonium , fits the hera data for large charmonium energy fraction @xmath0 @xcite , where the nrqcd model qualitatively fails @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that the cem accommodates the data at all @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we anticipate that the csm will fail at low @xmath0 , as it does in hadroproduction , since the @xmath3 photoproduction is mediated by resolved photons in that region .",
    "the evidence is compelling that nature operates according to the color evaporation scheme .",
    "the cem formalism simply predicts that , up to color and normalization factors , the energy , @xmath4- and @xmath5-dependence of the cross section are identical for the production of onium states and @xmath6 pairs .",
    "this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "the sum of the cross sections of all onium and open charm states is described by @xcite @xmath7 and @xmath8 where the cross section for producing heavy quarks , @xmath9 , is computed perturbatively , irrespective of the color of the @xmath10 pair .",
    "@xmath11 is the invariant mass of the @xmath10 pair .",
    "the cem assumes a factorization of the production of the @xmath1 pair , which is perturbative and process - dependent , and the materialization of this pair into a charmonium state by a mechanism that is nonperturbative and process independent .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , given that the characteristic time scales of the two processes are very different : the time scale for the production of the pair is the inverse of the heavy - quark mass , while the formation of the bound state is associated to the time scale @xmath12 .",
    "this approach to color is also suggestive of the unorthodox prescription for the production of rapidity gaps in deep inelastic scattering and in the production of hard jets at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "comparison with the @xmath2 data requires knowledge of the fraction @xmath13 of produced onium states that materialize as @xmath2 s , _",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath13 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the low - energy data @xcite .",
    "notice that a single nonperturbative factor @xmath15 describes a given charmonium state , regardless of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the charm pair .",
    "analysis of charmonium photoproduction allowed us to determined that @xmath16@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "even this parameter can be accounted for on the basis of statistical counting of final states @xcite , as expected in a scheme with no final state dynamics .",
    "quantitative tests of color evaporation are made possible by the fact that all @xmath2-production data , i.e.  photo- , hadroproduction , @xmath18-decay , etc .",
    ", are described in terms of the single parameter @xmath13 describing the frequency by which a charm pair turns into a @xmath3 via the final state color fluctuations .",
    "its value should , in the spirit of the model , be the same for all processes .",
    "we have demonstrated @xcite the quantitative precision of the color evaporation scheme by showing how it accommodates all measurements , including the high energy tevatron and hera data , which have represented a considerable challenge for other computational schemes .",
    "its parameter - free prediction of the rate for @xmath18-boson decay into @xmath2 s is an order of magnitude larger than the color singlet model and consistent with data @xcite .",
    "application of the the soft color scheme to inelastic charmonium photoproduction is straightforward .",
    "the photoproduction cross section is related to the @xmath19 cross section by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a function of the center  of  mass energy of the @xmath22 system , and @xmath23 is the distribution function of photons with virtuality @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath24 integration ranges from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( = 4 gev@xmath27 ) .",
    "the limits for the @xmath28 integral are @xmath29 , where @xmath30 represent the maximum / minimum experimental values of @xmath31 in the range @xmath32 gev @xcite .",
    "we used the following photon distribution function : @xmath33 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    according to the parton model , the cross section for the @xmath3 photoproduction at a given center  of  mass energy @xmath31 is @xmath34 where the subprocess cross section @xmath35 is given by eqs.([sig : on ] ) and ( [ frac ] ) in the cem . here",
    ", @xmath36 is the center  of  mass energy of the subprocess @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the distribution function of the parton @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in the photon ( proton ) . for direct photon interactions",
    "@xmath42 we have @xmath43 .",
    "the fraction of photon energy transferred to the @xmath3 in the proton rest frame is given by the lorentz invariant : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the four - momentum of the @xmath3 , photon , and proton , respectively .",
    "following the cuts applied by the experiments @xcite , we impose that the transverse momentum of the @xmath3 is larger than 1 gev .",
    "@xmath46 is the leading order process .",
    "it is , however , only important for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "it was , in fact , the process used in ref .",
    "@xcite to empirically determine the value of @xmath13 . for the range of @xmath0-values we are focusing on here ,",
    "the direct photon contribution is dominated by @xmath47 see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "the charm quark pair in @xmath48 fusion is produced in color singlet and octet configurations , while @xmath49 fusion leads to colored pairs only .",
    "these processes have to be evaluated with some caution because for soft values of the gluon transfer momentum @xmath50 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] , the diagram represents the qcd evolution of the initial state distribution functions . in order to avoid double - counting one imposes @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we also included resolved photon processes , which proceed via quark ",
    "quark , quark ",
    "gluon , and gluon  gluon fusion into @xmath52 quark ( gluon ) .",
    "the scattering amplitudes were evaluated using the packages madgraph @xcite and helas @xcite .",
    "the resulting charmonium photoproduction cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] as a function of the center  of  mass energy @xmath31 for @xmath53 .",
    "we fixed @xmath54 0.43 , and used grv distribution functions for the proton @xcite and photon @xcite .",
    "the adopted renormalization scale is the charm ",
    "quark mass @xmath55 for @xmath56 mev , while the factorization scale is @xmath57 .",
    "we varied @xmath55 between 1.2 and 1.4 gev .",
    "the relatively large uncertainty in our prediction indicates the need to include higher order corrections .",
    "this is expected because @xmath58 processes , although formally higher order , represent the dominant mechanism for @xmath59 charmonium production . nevertheless , it is important to notice that it is not a challenge to describe the data .",
    "having fixed any freedom in the definition of the perturbative series , we confront the cem calculation with the @xmath0dependence of the cross section for the inelastic @xmath3 photoproduction in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdep ] .",
    "this figure shows that cem successfully passes the test where nrqcd is at variance with the data@xcite .",
    "the result supports the underlying assumption of cem that the probability of charmonium formation from perturbative @xmath1 pairs is independent of the color state , angular momentum and spin of the charm quark pair .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : zres ] the direct  photon , resolved  photon , and total contributions to the @xmath0dependence of the inelastic @xmath3 photoproduction .",
    "the inclusion of resolved processes strongly increases the @xmath3 yield when @xmath60 .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath3 production in this region can seal , once more , the fate of the csm , since we anticipate that the omission of color octet gluon ",
    "gluon fusion processes will result in too small cross sections , as already observed in the tevatron data . in principle , this is remedied in the nrqcd framework which , however , fails for larger values of @xmath0 s .",
