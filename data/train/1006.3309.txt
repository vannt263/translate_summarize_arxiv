    "topologically massive gravity @xcite ( tmg ) is a 3-dimensional theory of gravity that exhibits gravitons and , for negative cosmological constant , black holes @xcite .",
    "its action is given by @xmath0 the interest in tmg was rekindled in 2008 due to a paper by li , song and strominger @xcite , and the discussion that ensued after the papers by carlip , deser , waldron and wise @xcite and two of the current authors @xcite . in this work",
    "we continue the tmg saga by explaining how to construct all its stationary , axi - symmetric solutions .",
    "finding non - trivial solutions to the tmg equations of motion is a very difficult problem and thus far few solutions are known .",
    "for a recent summary and algebraic classification of all known exact solutions see @xcite and references therein . as remarked in @xcite , one important reason for the scarceness of known solutions",
    "is the presence of no - go theorems .",
    "for instance , there are no non - trivial static solutions .",
    "in fact all solutions that have a ( non - null ) hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector are einstein @xcite . a weaker assumption that can aid in finding solutions is to require instead two commuting killing vectors .",
    "such spacetimes are the focus of this paper . in this case",
    "a powerful method pioneered by clement @xcite becomes available : stationary axi - symmetric tmg can be formulated in terms of a 0 + 1 dimensional theory .",
    "we call this theory `` topologically massive mechanics '' ( tmm ) . despite its superficial simplicity",
    "it is surprisingly difficult to find analytic solutions of this theory .",
    "on the other hand there are some non - existence results : for the tuning @xmath1 all solutions that satisfy brown - henneaux boundary conditions are einstein @xcite and for the case @xmath2 all solutions that satisfy a set of asymptotically warped boundary conditions are the null - warped black holes ( there is an anlog statement for @xmath3 asymptotic schrdinger black holes ) @xcite .",
    "let us classify the solutions of tmm into four sectors , restricting for the time being to negative cosmological constant @xmath4 .    1 .",
    "* einstein : * these solutions solve also the 3-dimensional einstein equations ; the only solutions in this sector are locally ads@xmath5 and obey brown  henneaux boundary conditions 2 .",
    "* schrdinger : * these solutions are either asymptotically schrdinger or asymptotically ads@xmath5 .",
    "they behave like zero modes of pp - waves .",
    "3 .   * warped : * these solutions are locally or asymptotically warped ads@xmath5 4 .",
    "* generic : * all solutions that are neither einstein , nor schrdinger , nor warped    the three first categories were essentially exhausted in @xcite and correspond to all presently known solutions of tmm .    in this work we analyse tmm and its space of solutions by several methods .",
    "first we perform a hamiltonian analysis and count the dimension of the physical phase space .",
    "we find that the phase space in general is six - dimensional .",
    "however , we find an interesting four - dimensional sub - space of the physical phase space occurring naturally .",
    "this subspace is generated by two conditions that are preserved by the equations of motion .",
    "assuming that these conditions hold reduces the dimension of the physical phase space to four .",
    "for this special subspace the hamiltonian dynamics simplify considerably and we are able to construct all local solutions in closed form .",
    "in fact , we prove that one is left with exactly the three first sectors : einstein , schrdinger and warped .",
    "the generic sector then contains all solutions outside this sub - space .    to describe the generic sector we resort to a numerical analysis",
    "it turns out that one needs to employ three slightly different methods depending on the initial data .",
    "we provide a complete algorithm for numerically constructing a solution given any consistent initial data .",
    "the numerical solutions that we find in the general sector have non - constant curvature invariants .",
    "some , but not all , of the examples we construct develop naked curvature singularities . in the set of smooth examples we discuss in particular soliton solutions that asymptote to warped ads and",
    "unravel their asymptotic ( non - analytic ) behaviour .",
    "we also generalise many of our results to tmg with vanishing or positive cosmological constant and address possible applications to recent new massive gravity theories .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] we review the derivation of tmm and provide a useful reformulation of the equations of motion . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we perform a hamiltonian analysis of tmm and count the dimension of the physical phase space . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we classify the solutions into einstein , schrdinger , warped and generic and prove that the generic sector is identical to the solutions violating the two conditions found in the hamiltonian analysis .",
    "we provide simple algorithms to construct local solutions for all possible cases in section [ sec:5 ] . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] we give several examples and show in particular that the generic sector is not empty",
    ". an outstanding class of examples are soliton solutions that asymptote to warped ads . in section [ sec : gen ] we provide generalisations to the case with vanishing or positive cosmological constant and give directions for future work .    before starting we list our conventions .",
    "we use signature @xmath6 . for the target space of tmm",
    "we bring the 3-dimensional minkowski metric into light - cone gauge @xmath7 .",
    "we fix the sign of the target space epsilon - tensor by choosing @xmath8 . to reduce clutter we drop overall factors in front of actions , since we are only interested in equations of motion and their solutions .",
    "our sign convention for the ricci - scalar is such that @xmath9 for ads .",
    "when we write lorentz vectors as row or column vectors the components of these vectors always have upper indices .",
    "we define the cross product between two lorentz vector as @xmath10 .",
    "following clement @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we employ the following gauge for a generic stationary , axi - symmetric 3-dimensional line - element    [ eq : clement ] @xmath11 with the 2-dimensional metric @xmath12 whose determinant is given by the norm of the lorentzian 3-vector @xmath13 @xmath14    all quantities depend on the radial coordinate @xmath15 only .",
    "the vector @xmath16 must be spacelike everywhere , possibly except at boundaries of the range of definition of @xmath15 where it can become null .",
    "these boundaries can correspond to curvature singularities , killing horizons , the radial centre or the asymptotic boundary of spacetime . for brevity",
    ", we use the term `` centre '' to refer to any point where @xmath17 .    plugging the ansatz for the line - element into the action and integrating out the killing coordinates @xmath18 yields a reduced action in 0 + 1 dimensions : @xmath19 dots denote derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath15 , which acts as `` time '' in the particle mechanics system described by the tmm action . any solution to the field equations descending from the action",
    "can be oxidised to a solution of tmg by virtue of the line - element .",
    "all stationary axi - symmetric solutions of tmg can be obtained locally in this way @xcite .",
    "for @xmath20 the action simplifies to the geodesic action . for finite @xmath21 this geodesic action is corrected by a non - linear higher derivative interaction originating from the chern ",
    "simons term .",
    "tmm describes a spacelike particle moving in an auxiliary 3-dimensional minkowski target space .",
    "the einbein @xmath22 in the tmm action acts as a lagrange multiplier .",
    "we set it to unity after variation , without loss of generality .",
    "this amounts to a gauge fixing of the @xmath15-reparameterisation invariance .",
    "variation with respect to the einbein yields the hamilton constraint @xmath23 variation with respect to the target space coordinates @xmath24 establishes the equations of motion @xmath25 invariance of the tmm action under lorentz transformations leads to the conserved angular momentum @xmath26 , which provides first integrals to the equations of motion .",
    "@xmath27 we provide now a useful reformulation of the equations of motion .",
    "the conserved angular momentum can be represented as @xmath28 combining the hamilton constraint conveniently with the first integrals yields the condition @xmath29 contracting the angular momentum @xmath26 with @xmath16 and using the equations of motion leads to the constraint @xmath30 given some initial data @xmath16 , @xmath31 and values for the constants of motion @xmath26 compatible with the conditions and the first integrals provide an evolution equation for @xmath32 . note that no third [ second ] derivative terms are present in [ , ] .    the equation for the angular momentum together with the constraints , fully describe the dynamics of the theory defined by the tmm action at all points , except at singularities of the line - element .",
    "our goal is to find all solutions of these equations , and thus locally all stationary , axi - symmetric solutions to tmg .",
    "we start with a counting of the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "to determine the dimension of the physical phase space we perform a constraint analysis in a suitable hamiltonian formulation .",
    "we rewrite the tmm action in first order form : @xmath33 our phase space is 20-dimensional , with canonical coordinates @xmath34 and canonical momenta @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is identical to @xmath24 , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 correspond to the velocity @xmath31 and acceleration @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "similar to the canonical analysis of tmg at the logarithmic point @xmath40 @xcite we have identified already the appropriate canonical momenta in order to avoid a larger phase space with more constraints , since such an approach eventually would reduce to the formulation that we are using as starting point ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the momenta @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in fact lagrange multipliers enforcing the relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian is given by @xmath45 with the hamilton constraint    [ eq : constraints ] @xmath46 defining the quantities @xmath47 we obtain the following set of constraints ( @xmath48 means weakly vanishing ) : @xmath49    two linear combinations of these twelve constraints are first class : @xmath50 and the extended hamiltonian @xmath51 @xmath52 where the lagrange multipliers @xmath53 are determined functions of the canonical variables .",
    "all other constraints are second class .",
    "we collect in [ app : a ] the non - vanishing poisson brackets between the constraints , results for the lagrange multipliers @xmath53 and the hamilton equations of motion .",
    "we conclude that the constraints eliminate fourteen degrees of freedom and we are left with a six - dimensional physical phase space .",
    "the physical phase space has an interesting subspace .",
    "namely , suppose that for some configuration all constraints are fulfilled and in addition the following constraints hold at some value of the `` time '' @xmath15 @xmath54 then these fourteen constraints hold for all times ( see [ app : a ] ) . if @xmath55 are linearly independent then the extended hamiltonian reduces to the canonical one .",
    "the subspace of the physical phase space defined by the additional constraints is only four - dimensional .",
    "interestingly , all currently known stationary , axi - symmetric solutions to tmg belong to this subspace .",
    "we note that the angular momentum takes a rather simple form in terms of canonical variables . @xmath56",
    "the angular momentum commutes with the canonical hamiltonian , with the extended hamiltonian , with the primary constraints @xmath57 and with the secondary constraints @xmath58 .",
    "the constraints and the hamilton equations of motion taken together are equivalent to the lagrangian equations of motion - .    in the next section",
    "we shall freely switch between the hamiltonian and the lagrangian formulation , depending on which description is most adequate to illuminate certain points . to facilitate this switching",
    "we always employ the gauge @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath59 in this gauge @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we consider here all solutions to the equations of motion - [ or , equivalently , of - ] .",
    "we classify the solutions into four sectors : einstein , schrdinger , warped and generic .    to simplify certain expressions we shall often exploit lorentz transformations , constant rescalings @xmath63 and constant shifts of @xmath15 , all of which leave invariant the line - element up to diffeomorphisms ( and possibly up to changes of ranges of definition of spacetime coordinates ) .",
    "the rescalings together with the @xmath64 transformations corresponding to lorentz boosts and rotations form the group @xmath65 .",
    "this sector encompasses all solutions with vanishing acceleration , @xmath66 .",
    "the geodesic equations of motion are supplemented by a simple constraint on the norm of the velocity @xmath67 the solution to the equations of motion is given by @xmath68 with some constant vectors @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "these solutions constitute all stationary , axi - symmetric solutions of einstein gravity , as pointed out first by clement @xcite . by exploiting lorentz transformations , rescalings of @xmath15 and shifts of @xmath15",
    "we can bring @xmath16 into one of the following forms ( @xmath71 ) @xmath72 the corresponding conserved angular momentum is given by @xmath73 at @xmath74 the coordinate vector becomes light - like .",
    "note that by boosting in the @xmath75-plane it is possible to eliminate also the single remaining constant of motion @xmath76 .",
    "thus all solutions are locally equivalent .",
    "we keep @xmath76 arbitrary since it makes it simpler to connect with the btz metric .",
    "the angular momentum becomes light - like at the logarithmic point @xmath40 for the first case and is always light - like for the second case ; we shall see below that the latter corresponds to extremal btz black holes .",
    "we discuss now briefly how to obtain the btz metric . inserting the left solution into the line - element one obtains @xmath77 where @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "the arbitrary constant @xmath80 parameterises the angular coordinate @xmath81 , which has periodicity of @xmath82 .",
    "defining new coordinates by @xmath83 , @xmath84 and parameterising the constant of motion as @xmath85 yields @xmath86 this is one of the standard ways to represent the btz black hole metric @xcite , where @xmath87 are related to outer / inner horizon @xmath88 and mass / angular momentum @xmath89 as follows : @xmath90 the extremal case @xmath91 arises as a singular limit of the first solution and is described adequately by the second solution .",
    "global ( poincar patch ) ads arises in the limit @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( @xmath92 , @xmath94 ) .",
    "the results above are obviously in accordance with the local triviality of 3-dimensional einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "all solutions in the einstein sector are locally and asymptotically ads .",
    "we shall encounter solutions in the other sectors that are also asymptotically ads . in tmg",
    "there are several possible behaviours for the subleading terms .",
    "a general fefferman ",
    "graham like expansion for the coordinate vector in the limit of large @xmath15 takes the form @xmath95 in tmg any vector @xmath16 compatible with the expansion leads to a 3-dimensional spacetime that is asymptotically ads . if the subleading terms @xmath96 are constant then the more restrictive brown  henneaux boundary conditions are fulfilled .",
    "( this eliminates certain asymptotically ads solutions of tmg . )",
    "these boundary conditions hold for , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "if @xmath96 is logarithmic in @xmath15 then the logarithmic boundary conditions of @xcite are required .",
    "we shall encounter such a solution below .",
    "if @xmath96 behaves like @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , then yet other boundary conditions apply @xcite .",
    "we give examples of such behaviour when describing the schrdinger sector below .",
    "this sector encompasses all solutions where the coordinate vector @xmath16 , its velocity @xmath31 and its acceleration @xmath32 are linearly dependent and acceleration is non - vanishing , @xmath99 .    if @xmath16 and @xmath31 are parallel then the equations of motion have no solution with @xmath99 , so we can disregard this case .",
    "thus , in order to get linear dependence between coordinate vector , velocity and acceleration we assume with no loss of generality @xmath100 then all triple products between any triple of coordinate vectors or its time derivatives vanish , and we obtain from the hamiltonian constraint and its time derivative the conditions @xmath101 contracting the equations of motion with the coordinate vector and its acceleration establishes @xmath102 the second equations in , imply that the assumptions are fulfilled . contracting the angular momentum with the acceleration yields @xmath103 since the angular momentum is constant the last condition implies that the acceleration must be proportional to some overall function times a constant vector that has vanishing inner product with the angular momentum .",
    "we exploit lorentz transformations to bring the light - like acceleration into a simple form .",
    "@xmath104 if @xmath105 vanishes we are back to the einstein sector discussed above .",
    "if @xmath105 is non - vanishing we can integrate the acceleration and impose the hamiltonian constraint to determine @xmath31 : @xmath106 now we integrate the velocity , impose the remaining constraints derived above and exploit constant shifts in @xmath15 so that the norm of @xmath16 is non - vanishing for positive @xmath15 : @xmath107 plugging this vector into the equations of motion yields a third order ordinary differential equation for @xmath108 that can be solved straightforwardly . exploiting rescalings of @xmath15",
    "we obtain the final result ( @xmath109 ) @xmath110 which depends on two integration constants @xmath111 and a sign @xmath112 .",
    "again , @xmath76 can be fixed to an arbitrary number by further lorentz transformations and @xmath113 can be rescaled by a positive number .",
    "we keep them arbitrary for convenience .",
    "the result leads to 3-dimensional spacetimes with asymptotic schrdinger behaviour : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant whose explicit value will be given below .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath116 is related to the parameters in the action as follows .",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath118 we obtain the special case of ( null-)warped ads , @xmath119 .",
    "despite the name `` null warped ''",
    "this solution belongs to the schrdinger sector according to our classification since @xmath16 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are linearly dependent .",
    "the constraint implies a light - like angular momentum @xmath122 the angular momentum provides one constant of motion @xmath113 .",
    "the periodicity of the angular coordinate @xmath123 constitutes a second free parameter .",
    "thus , again all geometries in this sector are parameterised by two constants , mass and angular momentum .",
    "let us now obtain the schrdinger line - element in standard form .",
    "we take the solution for @xmath16 , plug it into the definition of the line - element and obtain @xmath124 the linear coordinate transformation @xmath125 , @xmath126 together with the choice @xmath127 and the definition @xmath128 leads to @xmath129 this is precisely the line - element ( 21 ) of @xcite . the parameters @xmath130 in that work",
    "are related to the constants above by @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "the arbitrary constant @xmath80 parameterises the angular coordinate @xmath123 , which has periodicity @xmath82 . if the scaling exponent is smaller than one , @xmath133 , then the line - element asymptotes to ads .",
    "if the scaling exponent is larger than one , @xmath134 , then the asymptotic line - element in the limit @xmath135 takes the simple form provided we choose @xmath136 .",
    "if the scaling exponent is equal to one , @xmath137 , then we are at the logarithmic point @xmath40 that we have neglected so far .    at the logarithmic point @xmath40 we obtain two solutions .",
    "the first one is given by @xmath138 the angular momentum has again only a non - vanishing @xmath139-component given by @xmath140 .",
    "the result leads to a spacetime that is asymptotically ads reminiscent of the logarithmic mode discovered in @xcite .",
    "the other solution at the logarithmic point is given by @xmath141 the angular momentum has again only a non - vanishing @xmath139-component given by @xmath142 , consistent with the result .",
    "the result leads to a spacetime that marginally violates the asymptotically ads conditions .",
    "it is reminiscent of the sources for operators dual to the logarithmic mode @xcite within the logarithmic conformal field theory dual to tmg at the logarithmic point .",
    "like for @xmath143 we can fix both @xmath76 and @xmath113 in and by a combination of lorentz transformations and rescalings that leaves invariant the acceleration .",
    "this sector encompasses all solutions which obey the constraints and where coordinate vector @xmath16 , velocity @xmath31 and acceleration @xmath32 are linearly independent .",
    "imposing the constraints implies @xmath144 with some constant @xmath145 . due to our assumption of linear independence",
    "we can write @xmath146 the equalities imply @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath15-derivative of a suitable combination of the equations of motion establishes the constraint @xmath148 that must be valid for all solutions .",
    "therefore , also @xmath149 must vanish in and we obtain the condition @xmath150 the general solution in this sector then is given by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is light - like and orthogonal to @xmath153 ; the equations of motion , put further restrictions on the three constant vectors appearing in the solution .",
    "the fefferman  graham like expansion clearly is incompatible with asymptotic ads behaviour .",
    "in fact , the solutions correspond to warped ( squashed or stretched ) ads geometries",
    ". solutions of this type were discovered first by nutku @xcite .",
    "we exploit now shifts , lorentz transformations and rescalings and obtain @xmath154 as in the previous cases the constant of motion @xmath76 can be eliminated by a diffeomorphism together with a change of range of definition of the coordinates .",
    "the conserved angular momentum is given by @xmath155 the angular momentum becomes light - like for @xmath156 or @xmath157 . in the former case",
    "we obtain null warped solutions , in the latter case extremal warped black holes ( see below ) .",
    "we note that the null warped solutions actually belong to the schrdinger sector since @xmath16 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend linearly on each other .    to obtain the warped line - element",
    ", we take the solution for @xmath16 and plug it into the definition of the line - element , @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the coordinate transformation @xmath161 , @xmath162 leads to nutku s solution @xcite , provided we choose @xmath163 and define @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "other coordinate systems useful for the representation of warped ads and warped ads black holes are collected in @xcite .",
    "the two zeros in the denominator of the @xmath166 term in the line - element correspond to killing horizons .",
    "an extremal killing horizon emerges if the coupling constants and constant of motion are tuned as @xmath157 .",
    "this is precisely one of the conditions for @xmath26 becoming light - like that we found above .",
    "warped ads spacetimes have attracted a lot of interest recently as candidates for stable tmg backgrounds @xcite .",
    "they arise also as string theory solutions @xcite and as solutions to the einstein - perfect fluid field equations @xcite .      in the hamiltonian analysis we encountered the interesting feature that the physical phase space is six - dimensional in general , but only four - dimensional if the constraints @xmath167 hold [ see ] .",
    "these constraints are fulfilled for all sectors discussed so far .",
    "note also that these sectors exhaust all solutions for which holds .",
    "the generic sector consists of all solutions violating these constraints . @xmath168",
    "it is not clear a priori if there are any solutions in the generic sector .",
    "neither is it clear that this sector is empty .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to prove that no generic solutions exist for @xmath16 that are finite polynomials in @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , solutions for @xmath16 that are linear polynomials in @xmath15 lead to the einstein sector , quadratic polynomials to the warped or schrdinger sector and certain higher order polynomials to the schrdinger sector .",
    "we demonstrate in [ app : proof ] that _ all _ higher order polynomial solutions belong to the schrdinger sector .",
    "thus , any generic solution must be non - polynomial in @xmath15 , which makes it hard to obtain solutions by trial and error . in the next section",
    "we resolve this issue by providing numerical algorithms that allow to construct all local solutions in the generic sector .",
    "in the previous section we classified all solutions into einstein , schrdinger , warped and generic . moreover , we constructed explicitly all local solutions in the first three sectors .",
    "however , we did not discuss the generic sector in detail .",
    "the purpose of this section is to fill this gap .",
    "namely , we provide suitable initial data and algorithms to construct numerically all local solutions in the generic sector .",
    "we postpone an execution of these algorithms to section [ sec : examples ] below , where several examples will be presented . in the following we exploit shifts , lorentz transformations and rescalings to simplify the construction of solutions as much as possible .",
    "we consider first solutions with an analytic centre at some point , fixed to @xmath74 .",
    "the solutions are parameterised by one constant of motion",
    ". then we study solutions that do not necessarily have an analytic centre .",
    "we find that they are parameterised by three arbitrary constants of motion . in this case",
    "it is not possible to exploit shifts in @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the solutions with analytic centre correspond to a two - dimensional subset of the three initial data .",
    "we provide simple algorithms to construct all local solutions and collect them in [ app : alg ] .",
    "we assume for the time being that there exists a centre , in the sense that @xmath169 for some finite @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the vector @xmath16 is analytic in @xmath15 at the centre .",
    "we exploit shifts to make @xmath169 at @xmath74 , and lorentz transformations to bring @xmath16 into a convenient form .",
    "@xmath170 residual combinations of lorentz transformations and rescalings can be used to simplify @xmath31 without changing : we can boost in the @xmath171-plane and simultaneously rescale , or we can boost in @xmath172-direction , make a spatial rotation and then rescale .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we study first the case where @xmath173 at @xmath74 . in this case",
    "our ansatz for the initial data consistent with the equations of motion - is @xmath174 the evolution equations do not immediately determine @xmath32 , since the last term in those equations is multiplied by @xmath175 , which vanishes by our assumptions above at @xmath74 .",
    "however , taking the @xmath15-derivative of the evolution equations and using the on - shell identity @xmath176 we obtain @xmath177 at @xmath74 the right hand side of vanishes and setting the left hand side to zero determines @xmath32 at @xmath74 by means of the matrix equation @xmath178 with the matrix @xmath179 the matrix in the equations of motion - is invertible for @xmath180 . solving these equations",
    "establishes @xmath32 and @xmath181 . taking higher @xmath15-derivatives of establishes linear equations for higher derivatives of @xmath16 at @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the norm of the vector @xmath32 calculated in this way does not vanish in general at @xmath74 .",
    "it vanishes only if one of the following conditions holds @xmath182 for the same values of @xmath76 it turns out that the constraint @xmath183 holds at @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath184 we obtain warped solutions , while for @xmath185 we obtain einstein solutions .",
    "the generic sector contains only those solutions where @xmath76 is not given by the values listed in .",
    "we present in [ app : alg ] an algorithm to construct these solutions ( see algorithm 1 ) .",
    "this algorithm involves the inversion of @xmath186 matrices as the most complicated step , and therefore is not expensive in terms of computer time .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    let us now assume that @xmath187 at @xmath74 . then our ansatz for the initial data consistent with the equations of motion - , with no loss of generality , is @xmath188 here @xmath189 and @xmath76 is a constant of motion . in the present case",
    "the matrix is non - invertible .",
    "we then take the @xmath15-derivative of equation and obtain in this way an equation for @xmath181 at @xmath74 : @xmath190 solving the equations above with the ansatz turns out to be possible only if the initial data are further constrained .",
    "either @xmath191 and @xmath192 , in which case we find @xmath66 and recover solutions of the einstein sector with light - like angular momentum ; or @xmath193 , in which case we find @xmath194 and recover solutions of the warped sector with light - like angular momentum .",
    "thus , the ansatz does not lead to any solutions of the generic sector , except for @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "generic solutions with @xmath195 and @xmath196 are rather special . at a certain value of @xmath15 , which for convenience we shift to @xmath74 ,",
    "simultaneously the following quantities vanish : @xmath197 however , @xmath198 .",
