    "during the 1938 fifa world cup in france , adhemar pimenta , the coach of the brazilian national team , was facing a dilemma : spearheaded by lenidas da silva , the brazilians had defeated the polish in extra time and consecutively eliminated czechoslovakia in a replay after the `` battle of bordeaux .",
    "'' pimenta was becoming worried about the fatigue accumulation of his team members .",
    "the next opponent in the semifinal was italy , the reigning world champion at that time .",
    "worse was that the final with hungary would not be easier .",
    "after changing the starting lineup eight times , the coach decided to play the semifinal against italy without lenidas .",
    "then brazil lost to italy .",
    "one might say retrospectively that the coach was imprudent . however , it is not a trivial question what would have been a better choice in that situation , especially for the person directly involved .",
    "let us look back at their next encounter during the 1970 world cup in mexico .",
    "this time , italy advanced to the final after the `` game of the century '' against beckenbauer s germany .",
    "however , the energy exhausted in the semifinal turned out to be such a great loss that the azzurri was utterly defeated by the brazilians in the final .",
    "so they had to watch helplessly as brazil took permanent ownership of the jules rimet trophy .",
    "this kind of dilemma is by no means rare in tournament competitions .",
    "it might have originated from the unfairness of sports tournament compared to sports leagues , which is traded off against the efficiency of tournament competitions  @xcite .",
    "how to distribute stamina over a series of matches takes up an important part of the players strategies .",
    "we also point out that the dilemma captures an aspect of our society as a series of competitions , which is an essential part of our daily life from television shows like project runway to presidential elections with the two - round system .",
    "a sports tournament serves as a striking metaphor here , as clearly seen from the fact that people often talk about fair play , front - runners and a knock - out punch in these activities as well . in order to investigate this dilemma",
    ", we consider a simple model for a two - round tournament among four players with equal stamina .",
    "the players have to decide how much stamina to use in the first round ( i.e. , semifinals ) provided that only the rest is available in the second round .",
    "the second rounds take place between winners ( losers ) of the first round for the championship ( third place ) .",
    "we assume that the outcome of a match is described by a well - defined probability function .",
    "this function should contain all the essential information of the sport under consideration , such as the rules to decide the winner ( for additional discussions about the dynamics of competitions see refs .",
    "it gives the probability for a player to defeat an opponent as a function of their invested stamina , so it will be called the winning probability function  @xcite .",
    "the chance is 50:50 when two players spend the same amount of stamina and it is reasonable that the winning probability is a nondecreasing function of the stamina difference . at the end of the tournament",
    ", each player gets a prize ( payoff ) for the finishing place .",
    "we consider a general payoff structure under a plausible constraint that the payoff never decreases as a player moves up in rank .",
    "having defined the game by choosing the winning probability function together with the payoffs , we have to ask ourselves what we mean by solving this game . in game theory ,",
    "the nash equilibrium is the most well - known solution concept : once it is achieved , players can not be better off by changing their own strategy alone  @xcite .",
    "one may also investigate the game from an evolutionary point of view .",
    "the replicator dynamics is widely used to study the evolution of an infinite population with pure strategies  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we apply both methods to our tournament model for a better understanding and compare the results to check their consistency .    in terms of nash equilibrium , we find three different phases , which divide the payoff space into three regions .",
    "( i ) first , when the champion wins a much bigger payoff than the others , any pure strategy can constitute a nash equilibrium as long as all four players adopt it in common .",
    "( ii ) if the payoff for the second - place winner is also valuable enough , one has no reason to fight in the second round .",
    "therefore , the only nash equilibrium is such that everyone spends all the stamina in the first round , i.e , semifinals .",
    "( iii ) finally , if the payoff for last place is much smaller than the others , a nash equilibrium emerges when everyone adopts a mixed strategy using all or none of the stamina with proper weights .    the above three phases",
    "are also analytically tractable from the viewpoint of evolutionary dynamics when the winning probability function is the heaviside step function of the stamina difference between two players .",
    "the results of the replicator dynamics are as follows . for case ( i )",
    ", the population evolves to a single species adopting a common pure strategy .",
    "which pure strategy to adopt in the long run depends on the initial strategy distribution . for case ( ii )",
    ", the population evolves to a single species using all the stamina in the first round . for case ( iii ) , the population becomes a genetic polymorphism of two species .",
    "one spends all the stamina in the first round , while the other reserves it all for the second round .",
    "the proportions of these species correspond to the weights of the mixed - strategy nash equilibrium in case ( iii ) .",
    "these solutions are fully consistent with the analysis of nash equilibria .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define our game of the two - round tournament in detail by specifying its strategy space and payoff structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nash ] we focus on symmetric nash equilibria of this game .",
    "we begin with simple limiting payoff structures and then proceed to a general payoff structure to find nash equilibria for the entire payoff space .",
    "this analysis is followed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ed ] by the evolutionary dynamics of an infinite population with pure strategies and a comparison of the results with the nash equilibria .",
    "let us consider four equally strong semifinalists and denote them by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in the first round , player @xmath0 meets @xmath1 , while @xmath2 meets @xmath3 .",
    "the second round takes place between winners ( for the championship ) and between losers ( for third place ) of the first round .",
    "the players payoffs are given according to the tournament result .",
    "the numerical values of the payoffs are denoted by @xmath4 for the champion , @xmath5 for the second - place winner , @xmath6 for the third - place winner , and @xmath7 for last place , where @xmath8 .",
    "nash equilibria and replicator dynamics are invariant under translation and rescaling of the payoffs by a positive factor , so we may set @xmath9 and @xmath10 without loss of generality .",
    "then the payoff parameter space reduces to the @xmath11 plane with @xmath12 .",
    "each player s strategy determines how much stamina will be spent in the first round provided that the rest is available in the second round .",
    "we assume that all the players have an equal amount of stamina at the beginning and normalize it as @xmath13",
    ". then player @xmath14 s strategy , which is generally a mixed one , is expressed by a normalized distribution function @xmath15 of the mixing weights over a closed interval @xmath16 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath17 . if the player adopts a pure strategy of investing @xmath18 in the first round , for example , @xmath19 . as a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we will often abbreviate such a pure strategy as @xmath18 .",
    "suppose that the players have formed a strategy profile  @xcite @xmath20 . in order to calculate expected payoffs , we need the winning probability function @xmath21 .",
    "it tells us how likely player @xmath14 is to defeat player @xmath22 when they use stamina @xmath18 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we furthermore assume that @xmath24 is a nondecreasing function of the stamina difference @xmath25 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that a player s winning probability never decreases as that player s investment increases . we do not consider a draw as a match outcome and require @xmath27 .",
    "then we have @xmath28 , i.e. , two players spending the same amount of stamina have an equal chance to win the match . it is convenient to consider only the relative difference from @xmath29 by defining @xmath30 , which is an odd function , because @xmath31 .",
    "it is non - negative for @xmath32 and has a maximum at @xmath33 .",
    "the maximum is bounded by @xmath34 from above , because @xmath35 .",

    "alternatively , the opponent can be player @xmath3 with probability @xmath44 , and player @xmath0 will defeat @xmath3 with probability @xmath45 .",

    "that our model is similar to the war of attrition ( wa ) in that each strategy is defined on a continuous space , leading to an infinite - sized payoff matrix .",
    "in addition , the wa bears a strong similarity to the chicken game , as ours does when it matters not to be the loser .",
    "one might even think of the semifinalists dilemma as a variant of this famous game , where each player s remaining resources after the bid become as much important as the victory itself . obviously , such a variation would just reflect the existence of the second round in our case .",
    "in addition , this modification will induce a player to give up the first round more easily whenever the opponent appears aggressive enough . beyond a qualitative level , however , it is hard to predict the behavior , like the ratio between investing 0% and 100% in the first round , by this analogy . at the same time , we point out a subtle difference of our game in that it is essentially one s own bid in the first round that determines one s remaining resources , whereas it would rather be one s first opponent s bid in the wa  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider a simple limiting case of the payoff structure by setting @xmath56 . in other words , only the champion who has won both rounds gets a prize , so it can be regarded as a winner - take - all system .",
    "we will show that there exists an infinite number of nash equilibria of pure strategies where the players coordinate their strategies by choosing the same value .",
    "if someone spends less in the first round than this coordination , that player becomes more likely to lose the first match .",
