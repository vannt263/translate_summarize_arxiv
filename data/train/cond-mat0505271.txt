    "@xcite , this effective medium result should not be valid when thermal or quantum fluctuations become large enough to destroy phase coherence between grains . in the present case ,",

    "then , considering the additional effect of the charging energy@xcite , there could be in the present case large fluctuations which contribute to destroy the phase coherence between grains , with a paracoherent state above @xmath5 .",

    "further above @xmath5 , the characteristic voltage is set by the pair relaxation time . in both cases",
    ", the temperature sets the energy scale and , apart from different temperature dependences , the result for the characteristic electrical field is essentially the same as for the bulk , @xmath75 . when coupling is strong enough so that the correlation length of the array exceeds the separation of the grains , the array has collective modes@xcite . assuming a uniform flow , the effect of the transport current is a mere shift of the array free energy , just as a uniform stress on an harmonic crystal leaves its normal vibrating modes unchanged . as a consequence , within the debye approximation@xcite",
    ", we do not expect that the current should alter the fluctuations of the array before it breaks the coupling in the individual junctions .",
    "then , it seems impossible to explain a substantial reduction of the characteristic electrical field from a model of sis junctions array . so far however , we have not considered the possibility that , although granular , the junctions are not of the sis type , but of the sns one . in the latter case ,",

    ", we expect that , in the fluctuation regime when @xmath79 , the characteristic voltage across the junction should be determined by the effective gap value in the metal , which is reduced roughly in the same proportion ( the diffusion time in the normal metal being less than the pair lifetime , @xmath80 ) . using @xmath81 ev  ",
    ", one has @xmath82 , so that to obtain the measured reduction of the effective gap value , @xmath83 , of two orders of magnitude , normal domains as large as @xmath84   are needed ( we have used the clean limit for these estimates , as the mean free path is found @xmath85 from the plasma frequency and the resistivity  see below ) .",
    "there are , however , objections to the existence of such normal metal domains .",
    "first , such a large value of the domain size is unlikely , being much larger than the inhomogeneities which have been put into evidence in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacuo@xmath58 .",
    "then , while in the case of bi - based materials metallic domains may exist , as overdoping is easy ( a possibility not available in other materials , such as yba@xmath1cu@xmath7o@xmath86 ) , we would expect a reduction of the normal domain size when doping is reduced ( approaching the insulating state ) , while the effective gap reduction appears to be uniform with doping .",
    "several other mechanisms have been proposed that may also contribute to a decrease of the apparent gap value in junctions @xmath87 characteristic .",
    "below @xmath5 , these mechanisms are invoked to account for the small @xmath88 product generally observed for grain boundary junctions@xcite .",
    "as pointed out by halbritter@xcite , real junctions in cuprates  either natural or artificial  may be far from the idealized sharp barriers , which are fully described by the energy barrier and the tunneling distance .",
    "in particular , he has shown that resonant - states in an insulating barrier may account for a proximity - like effect , but with a much reduced effective normal metal coherence length , which can be in the nanometer range .",
    "identical mechanisms may be at work to weaken the effective superconducting interaction of the fluctuating tunneling pairs .",
    "such mechanisms are needed to conciliate the granular description and the experimental observations .",
    "more generally , it must be noticed that the resonant states mechanism mimics a _ gapless _ superconductivity . as stressed in @xcite ,",
    "the microscopic mechanism at the interface is not truly gapless , as both the gap value and the transition temperature are reduced at the interface , so that the ratio @xmath89 is essentially invariant .",
    "however , the granular material made of such junctions does exhibit a reduced @xmath89 ratio , when @xmath90 is inferred from the nonlinear transport properties .",
    "one may wonder if a truly gapless superconductivity could account for our results .",
    "gapless superconductivity may be obtained from a bulk scattering mechanism .",
    "as well known , _ in the case of a d - wave superconductor _ , the superconducting transition temperature , the superfluid density , the depairing current density , all decrease roughly linearly in a large range of the inverse scattering rate , @xmath91 , reaching zero for @xmath92@xcite .",
    "a strong pair - breaking effect is plausible in the case of bi-2201 .",
    "an estimate for the scattering rate @xmath93  ps may be obtained , using @xmath94  cm@xmath52 as the plasma frequency @xcite and @xmath96  cm .",
    "this yields for the pure material @xmath97  k and @xmath98 .",
    "we expect that such a disordered , gapless superconductor may exhibit a strongly reduced characteristic electrical field , as this field is determined by the energy spectrum of the excitations , rather than by the non - zero pair potential@xcite . however , scanning tunneling spectroscopy showed clear evidence for a superconducting gap in bi-2201 , with well defined coherence peaks , but strongly inhomogeneous at some length scale below 20  nm@xcite . as a consequence , a bulk",
    ", homogeneous description of the disorder in this material , leading to gapless superconductivity , seems to be inadequate and a granular description more appropriate .",
    "however , in the absence of available theories for the non linear excess conductivity in disordered d - wave materials , we can not totally exclude the homogeneous disordered scenario .",
    "so far , we have considered only the effect of the current on the fluctuating inter - grain josephson current , but it is worth pointing out the possibility of a contribution of the normal state of the granular medium to the non linear resistivity .",
    "indeed , there is an electric field - induced conduction in the case of granular metals , which has been modeled in refs.@xcite . the model accounts for both the exponential decrease of the low temperature conductivity with electric field , and the activated behavior of the low electric field regime when transport is dominated by the charging energy of the grains .",
    "however , this picture is difficult to reconcile with the observation that the non - linearity effect follows the same doping dependence as the transition temperature and , thus , is likely related to the superconducting fluctuations rather than to the normal state .",
    "this difficulty may be circumvented provided one links the occurrence of superconductivity with the normal state properties themselves . going to the underdoped regime , one may expect an increase of the charging energy and of the barrier height between grains , yielding an increase of the characteristic electric field @xcite , consistent with our observations .",
    "moreover , assuming that the superconducting transition is set by the charging energy being of the order of the josephson coupling energy , it is found that the electric field for non linearity is reduced by the wkb tunneling rate exponential factor , with respect to the intrinsic value@xcite .",
    "however , within such a picture , it is still difficult to account for the scaling of the non linear effect with the critical temperature in the _ whole _ doping range . in a general way ,",
    "this scaling indicates that granularity is here likely different from the one observed in @xcite , which was found more pronounced in the underdoped regime than it is in the overdoped one .",
    "then , although a similar mechanism should not be excluded in the case of an intrinsic granularity ( such as a real space electronic phase separation for a slightly doped mott insulator ) , disorder should , in the present case , be attributed to some local off - stoichiometry or some structural disorder , independent of the doping level . also , it is worth to underline that such a disorder apparently brings the energy scale for fluctuations suppression to such a low value , that the pseudo - gap phase for this compound @xcite would not be uncovered by the current , even though it could involve superconducting fluctuations .",
    "concerning the origin of these inhomogeneities , amongst the bi family , bi-2201 exhibits a more pronounced modulation of the bio plane@xcite .",
    "such a disorder was invoked in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the anomalously low value of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath99 k , where parent compounds such as tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cuo@xmath100 or hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath101 have a maximum critical transition temperature @xmath59 90  k. moreover , when cation substitution la / sr is made on bi-2201 , the modulation is reduced and the maximum transition temperature is increased@xcite .",
    "the nanoscale domains arising from this modulation could be at the origin of some granularity in the superconducting plane .",
    "although there is at present no direct evidence that these domains induce some inhomogeneity in the superconducting gap@xcite , it remains that the la substituted material exhibits a reduced sensitivity to the electrical field .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ bila ] where the bi@xmath1sr@xmath102la@xmath103cuo@xmath104 material , with a residual resistivity less than the pure material and , presumably , less disorder , also clearly shows a reduced effect of the electrical field .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the non linearity with current of the excess - conductivity amplitude for a bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin film at various doping states , measured well above @xmath5 , is related to the reduced temperature @xmath3 only .",
    "its magnitude as well as its temperature dependence are clearly different from the expectations from the theory of gaussian fluctuations in a conventional two - dimensional superconductor . based on scanning tunneling measurements",
