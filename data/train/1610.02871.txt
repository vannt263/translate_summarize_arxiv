    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) are a subset of qsos which show blue - shifted absorption lines with widths @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 in their rest - frame ultraviolet spectra .",
    "most are identified by absorption due to civ , observed to the blue of the civ 1550   broad emission line .",
    "balqsos represent between 5 and 20 per  cent of the qso population @xcite , with the fraction somewhat dependent on the criteria used to define balqsos .",
    "it was realised during the 1990s that balqsos were systematically fainter in the x - ray band than qsos without bals @xcite . since the launches of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _",
    ", considerable advances have been made in characterising the x - ray properties of optically - selected balqsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with strong x - ray absorption appearing to be an ubiquitous characteristic of optically - selected balqsos .",
    "as might be expected , given their x - ray faintness , balqsos are rarely discovered through x - ray sky surveys .",
    "exceptions include one balqso found in the chandra deep field south @xcite , and two discovered during the axis survey @xcite . the largest sample of x - ray selected balqsos comes from the 1@xmath5  deep field , which yielded four such objects @xcite .",
    "the properties of the four 1@xmath5 balqsos and the cdfs balqso were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "they found that in terms of their rest - frame 2500    to 2  kev spectral slopes ( @xmath6 ) the x - ray - selected balqsos were a little less x - ray faint than optically - selected balqso samples , but still faint in the x - ray compared to x - ray selected non - bal qso samples . from the x - ray spectral shapes",
    ", @xcite inferred that the x - ray - selected balqsos had similar levels of x - ray absorption to those seen in optically - selected samples of balqsos .",
    "somewhat contradictory results were presented by @xcite , who obtained a sample of 54 x - ray detected balqsos by cross - correlating the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 ( dr5 ) qso catalogue @xcite with the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous x - ray source catalogue ( 2xmm ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found that one third of the balqsos in their sample showed little or no x - ray absorption in their x - ray spectra , and that the distribution of @xmath1 of their sample was indistinguishable from that of non - bal qsos , implying that the balqsos in their sample are not x - ray weak .",
    "subsequently , @xcite compiled a sample of 88 x - ray - detected balqsos by cross - correlating the 2xmm catalogue with balqsos in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "they found that when the x - ray absorption is modelled as ionized gas , as opposed to the neutral absorber model considered by @xcite , 90 per cent of the x - ray detected balqsos showed x - ray absorption .",
    "@xcite did not examine the @xmath1 distribution of their balqso sample .",
    "it is notable that the x - ray properties found for samples of balqsos may depend on the criterion that was used to identify the balqsos from their rest - frame uv spectra .",
    "a quantitative criterion for classifying an object as a balqso was introduced in the form of the balnicity index ( bi ) by @xcite . for a full definition of balnicity index ,",
    "see appendix a of @xcite , but in simple terms it is approximately the equivalent width in km  s@xmath4 of continuous troughs of absorption , with outflow velocities between 3000 and 30000 km  s@xmath4 to the blue of civ @xmath71550 , and from which the first 2000 km  s@xmath4 velocity interval of each absorption trough is excluded from the calculation .",
    "thus bi@xmath8 implies at least one absorption trough with a width of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 . according to @xcite",
    ", bi@xmath8 is required to classify an object as a balqso .",
    "an alternative criterion , known as the absorption index ( ai ) , was introduced by @xcite , based on an earlier proposal by @xcite .",
    "in essence , the ai is also an equivalent width measurement , but includes the contribution of absorption troughs with outflow velocities below 3000  km  s@xmath4 , and requires a minimum absorption trough width of only 1000  km  s@xmath4 to yield a positive ai .",
    "thus bi@xmath8 is a more conservative criterion for the classification of balqsos than ai@xmath8 .",
    "prior to 2006 , balqsos studied in the x - ray were usually selected by bi , as was the sample studied by @xcite .",
    "however the balqso sample of @xcite was based on ai .",
    "@xcite selected the sample on ai , but also presented bi values for their sample .",
    "they found that while the sources in their sample with bi@xmath8 were almost always absorbed , the sources in their sample with bi=0 typically did not have significant x - ray absorption .",
    "in this paper we present a new sample of x - ray selected balqsos , which is larger and brighter in x - rays than the sample presented by @xcite .",
    "we use the new sample to investigate the x - ray properties of such objects , in particular their optical to x - ray spectral indices and the incidence of x - ray absorbing gas . throughout",
    ", we use the phrase `` x - ray selected balqsos '' specifically for objects which were discovered first as x - ray sources , and then found to be balqsos in the subsequent optical spectroscopic follow up .",

    "in contrast , optically - selected samples of balqsos usually show much larger values of @xmath1 than our x - ray - selected sample .",

    "our findings suggest that x - ray absorption is a universal property of balqsos , but imply that x - ray weakness ( i.e. large @xmath1 ) is not .    in the study of @xcite",
    "there were two notable correlations concerning the x - ray absorbers , which @xcite modelled as ionized absorbers .",
    "first , they found a correlation between the ionization parameter @xmath46 and @xmath40 , and second they found a correlation between @xmath40 and the bi of the ultraviolet absorption .",
    "our sample is too small to permit such a correlation analysis , but our spectral fitting may provide some insights into these correlations .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : xconts ] that with the current statistics in our x - ray spectra , the ionization parameters of the absorbers are not constrained , and there is significant covariance between log  @xmath46 and log  @xmath40 in the individual spectral fits",
    ". the six balqsos in our sample show a consistent trend in correlation between log  @xmath46 and log  @xmath40 to that found by @xcite , but it can be accounted for entirely by this covariance .",
    "the ionized absorption model we have used , xabs in spex , is more sophisticated than that used by @xcite , absori in xspec @xcite , because xabs includes bound - bound transitions as well as bound - free transitions , while absori includes only bound - free transitions .",
    "however , we would expect a similar level of covariance between log  @xmath46 and log  @xmath40 in the two models .",
    "most of the balqsos in the sample of @xcite for which spectral fitting has been performed are brighter in x - rays than those in our sample , so the degeneracy between @xmath46 and @xmath40 may be mitigated to some extent by the improved photon statistics compared to our sample , but it is nonetheless a concern that some or all of the correlation found by @xcite between @xmath46 and @xmath40 may be a consequence of the covariance of these two parameters .    of the correlation found by @xcite between bi and @xmath40 we can neither confirm nor refute this correlation with our small sample . some insight on the relation between ultraviolet civ absorption and x - ray absorption in qsos may be drawn by comparing our sample of balqsos with the x - ray absorbed qsos studied by @xcite .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : xconts ] with the corresponding figure  4 in @xcite ( and disregarding the object rxj124913 from their sample , which is itself a balqso ) , we find that the x - ray absorbed qsos have confidence contours in ( log  @xmath46 , log  @xmath40 ) which fall systematically below those of our balqso sample . despite the degeneracy between @xmath46 and @xmath40 in both samples , the x - ray selected balqsos have systematically more x - ray absorption than the x - ray absorbed qsos , which were also x - ray selected .",
    "the x - ray absorbed qsos of @xcite also have lower civ equivalent widths than the balqsos .",
    "there thus appears to be a continous spectrum of qso absorption properties , from the majority of qsos which have civ equivalent widths of @xmath114    and minimal x - ray absorption , through the x - ray absorbed qsos which typically have civ equivalent widths in the range of @xmath115    and moderate x - ray absorption , to the balqsos which have civ equivalent widths @xmath116    and the strongest x - ray absorption . a similar correlation between civ equivalent width and @xmath1 has long been established @xcite . as x - ray absorption appears to be a universal property of balqsos but",
    "large @xmath1 is not , the connection between civ absorption and x - ray absorption may be considered more fundamental than that between civ and @xmath1 .",
    "significant x - ray absorption , with log  @xmath117  @xmath42 appears to be a ubiquitous property amongst x - ray selected balqsos , defined according to the classical bi @xmath118 criterion , as presented here and by @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite for balqsos identified by correlating optical catalogues with the 2xmm catalogue .",
    "we are thus led to the same conclusion as @xcite that the rather different absorption properties found by @xcite for x - ray detected balqsos , probably relates to their use of the ai definition of balqsos .",
    "the ai criterion used by @xcite includes objects with lower civ equivalent widths than the classical bi criterion , and this may account for the comparatively weak x - ray absorption found by those authors for some of their sample .",
    "the apparent difference in x - rays between balqsos defined by bi and those defined by ai ( and not bi ) is interesting in the context of the bimodality of the ai distribution demonstrated by @xcite and their interpretation that the bimodality corresponds to two distinct sub - populations of qsos .",
    "it appears that the two sub - populations selected by ai have distinct distributions in x - ray absorption , as well as in their uv absorption - line properties .",
    "we have presented a sample of six x - ray selected balqsos from xwas .",
    "examination of their x - ray spectra indicates that all have hard spectral shapes compared to the majority of qsos , suggesting absorption .",
    "an ionized absorption model applied to a typical agn template x - ray spectrum is able to reproduce the x - ray spectral shapes , and implies that these are intrinsically rather x - ray bright for qsos given their uv luminosities .",
    "x - ray absorption appears to be ubiquitous in classically - defined ( i.e. bi  @xmath39  0 ) balqsos , and this is true for x - ray - selected balqsos as well as for optically - selected samples .",
    "in contrast , x - ray weakness ( i.e. high @xmath1 ) is not a universal property of balqsos .",
    "we have argued that there is a continuous spectrum of x - ray absorption properties in qsos which are related to the equivalent width of ultraviolet civ absorption , with balqsos forming the most heavily absorbed end of the distribution .",

    "<S> we study a sample of six x - ray selected broad absorption line ( bal ) quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) from the _ xmm - newton _ wide angle survey . </S>",
    "<S> all six objects are classified as balqsos using the classic balnicity index , and together they form the largest sample of x - ray selected balqsos . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for absorption in the x - ray spectra of all six objects . </S>",
    "<S> an ionized absorption model applied to an x - ray spectral shape that would be typical for non - bal qsos ( a power law with energy index @xmath0 ) provides acceptable fits to the x - ray spectra of all six objects . </S>",
    "<S> the optical to x - ray spectral indices , @xmath1 , of the x - ray selected balqsos , have a mean value of @xmath2 , which is similar to that found for x - ray selected and optically selected non - bal qsos of similar ultraviolet luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , optically - selected balqsos typically have much larger @xmath1 and so are characterised as being x - ray weak . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply that x - ray selection yields intrinsically x - ray bright balqsos , but their x - ray spectra are absorbed by a similar degree to that seen in optically - selected balqso samples ; x - ray absorption appears to be ubiquitous in balqsos , but x - ray weakness is not . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that balqsos sit at one end of a spectrum of x - ray absorption properties in qsos related to the degree of ultraviolet absorption in civ1550 .    </S>",
    "<S> x - rays : galaxies  quasars : absorption lines </S>"
