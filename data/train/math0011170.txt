    "was asked by perles @xcite a long time ago :    _ does every @xmath1-regular , induced , connected , non - separating subgraph of the graph of a simple @xmath0-polytope correspond to a facet of  @xmath5 ? _",
    "this question is important in the context of reconstruction of polytopes .",
    "( see @xcite for a general source on reconstruction of polytopes , and in particular for perles unpublished work in this field . )",
    "simple polytopes can theoretically be reconstructed from their graphs  this was originally conjectured by perles , and first proved by blind & mani @xcite , and particularly elegantly by kalai  @xcite . however , although kalai s proof can be implemented to reconstruct polytopes of reasonable size @xcite , the reconstruction is far from easy or efficient ( in the theoretical or practical sense ) .    using ideas from kalai",
    "s paper @xcite , joswig , kaibel & krner @xcite derived a certificate for the reconstruction of a simple polytope that can indeed be checked in polynomial time .",
    "they do , however , not ( yet ) have a polynomial time algorithm to find / construct such a certificate . if perles question had a positive answer , then the reconstruction would be much easier , as was noted by kalai @xcite , and by achatz & kleinschmidt  @xcite .",
    "in particular , perles conjecture proposes an efficient criterion for recognizing the facet subgraphs of simple polytopes , and thus an easy check whether a given list of subgraphs is indeed the complete list of facet subgraphs .    here",
    "we first establish that perles conjecture is true for non - trivial classes of polytopes , including all the duals of stacked polytopes , and the duals of cyclic polytopes ( section  [ sec : positive ] ) .    however , our main result is that , perhaps surprisingly , perles conjecture is _ not true _ in general . to prove this , we first identify certain topological obstructions for perles conjecture ( section  [ sec : obstruction ] ) .",
    "we then take ( known ) @xmath4-dimensional complexes that realize this obstruction ",
    "the simplest one to handle being known as `` bing s house with two rooms '' ( with two walls removed ) .",
    "we describe fairly general methods to produce counterexamples from such @xmath4-complexes . a small",
    ", explicit counterexample derived this way will be presented as an electronic geometry model ( www.eg-models.de ) .",

    "if @xmath5 is a simple polytope , then its polar dual @xmath3 is simplicial .",
    "the vertices and edges of @xmath5 correspond to the facets and ridges of @xmath3 .",
    "the different notions in perles conjecture for @xmath5 have immediate translations to the combinatorics of  @xmath3 .",
    "this yields the `` puzzle '' reformulation of  @xcite .    *",
    "an induced subgraph @xmath10 of the graph of @xmath5 corresponds to a collection of facets and ridges of @xmath3 such that , whenever two adjacent facets belong to the collection , then their common ridge also is in the collection .",
    "we will present this collection of facets and ridges in terms of the pure simplicial @xmath1-complex @xmath11 that it generates .",
    "the dual graph of this `` pseudomanifold '' is the one that perles conjecture in the original form refers to . *",
    "the induced subgraph @xmath10 is ( @xmath12)-regular if and only if every ( @xmath12)-simplex in @xmath11 has exactly one free ( @xmath13)-simplex .",

    "( this is often called `` strongly connected '' for pseudomanifolds . )",
    "* the induced subgraph does not separate its complement ( graph theoretically ) if and only if the corresponding subcomplex does not separate its complement ( topologically ) : this is true since the topological complement retracts to the `` dual block complex '' @xcite whose @xmath14-skeleton is the graph of the complement . *",
    "if @xmath10 is the graph of a facet , then the corresponding subcomplex @xmath11 is a vertex star : the collection of all facets that contain a given vertex .",
    "a simplicial @xmath0-polytope _ satisfies perles conjecture _ if the vertex stars are the only pure @xmath1-dimensional , dually connected , non - separating subcomplexes of its boundary for which every maximal simplex has exactly one free face .",

    "before embarking on the construction of counterexamples , and as an indication why these need to be rather complicated , we will here demonstrate that perles conjecture is not only _ quite plausible _ , but also that it is _ true _ on large classes of examples : it is certainly not an `` unreasonable '' conjecture .",
    "we may safely assume that perles himself verified his conjecture for non - trivial classes of examples ; the diplomarbeit of stolletz @xcite also has a number of positive results .",
    "thus , perles conjecture is true , for example , for all @xmath0-dimensional polytopes with @xmath15 ( even without a restriction to simple / simplicial polytopes ) , for all @xmath2-dimensional simple polytopes with at most @xmath16 vertices ( * ? ? ?",

    "* satz  3.1.3 ) .    indeed , the treatment of vertex truncations , and thus of stacked polytopes , presents no greater difficulties .",
    "truncation ( `` cutting off a simple vertex '' ) preserves the validity of perles conjecture : a vertex - truncated simple @xmath0-polytope @xmath17 satisfies perles conjecture if and only if @xmath5 satisfies it .",
    "all stacked polytopes ( dually : the multiple vertex - truncations of simplices ) satisfy perles conjecture .",
    "we now develop a rather systematic method to prove perles conjecture for classes of simple polytopes .",
    "we demonstrate its use for products , for wedges , and in particular for the duals of cyclic polytopes .",
    "here is the idea : let @xmath5 be a simple @xmath0-polytope , @xmath6 its graph , with vertex set  @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath1-regular induced connected subgraphs @xmath10 that do nt separate ; as induced subgraphs they are given by their vertex sets @xmath19 .",
    "the ` ansatz ' is to concentrate on the vertex set @xmath20 of the complement of @xmath10 in  @xmath21 . in the _ first step",
    "_ we ( try to ) classify all those vertex sets @xmath22 for which    1 .",
    "the induced subgraph @xmath23 $ ] is connected , and 2 .",
    "@xmath24 is triangle - closed and quadrilateral - closed : if @xmath24 contains `` all but one '' vertices of a triangle or quadrilateral of  @xmath21 , then it must contain all its vertices .",
    "the first condition is necessary since we want @xmath10 to be non - separating . if the second condition is violated , then the `` missing vertex '' has two neighbors in  @xmath24 , and thus has degree at most @xmath13 in  @xmath10 .    in the _ second step _",
    "we then identify those sets @xmath24 for which every vertex not in  @xmath24 has exactly one neighbor in  @xmath24 .",
    "our hope is then to end up with only the ( complements of ) facet subgraphs , plus the trivial examples given by  @xmath25 .",
    "[ prop : product ] if two simple polytopes @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy perles conjecture , then so does their product  @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a @xmath30-regular subgraph that is connected and does not separate ( @xmath31 ) . now ( step  1 ) if the complement vertex set @xmath24 satisfies ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , then it is a product set , @xmath32 .",
    "property ( 2 ) at work in a product graph    now ( step  2 ) if we can choose @xmath33 for @xmath34 , then this yields a vertex @xmath35 that in  @xmath36 has graph - theoretic distance at least  @xmath4 from the complement set @xmath37 ( symbolized by the vertex @xmath38 in our figure ) .",
    "thus this vertex of  @xmath10 has degree @xmath39 , which is impossible .",
    "hence we get that the @xmath30-regular , induced , connected and non - separating subgraphs all have the form @xmath40 or @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is @xmath43-regular , induced , connected and non - separating . by perles conjecture , which is valid for @xmath44 , it follows that @xmath45 is the graph of a facet of  @xmath44 , and hence that @xmath10 is the graph of a facet of  @xmath28 .",
