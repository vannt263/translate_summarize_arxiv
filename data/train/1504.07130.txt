    "introduced by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite about thirty years ago , the _ weak value _ arises in the outcome of weak measurement with postselection , which is conventionally abbreviated as _",
    "weak measurement_. weak values play the same role in weak measurements as expectation values play in von neumann measurements .",
    "the central task of many impressive applications of weak measurements is then to determine the weak values which could incorporate the desired information @xcite .",
    "for example , weak - value tomography , to which we shall pay more attention below , has realized the direct measurements of both quantum states @xcite and quantum dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "the directness and simplicity of weak - value tomography in implementation make it perhaps the unique option for the reconstructions of high - dimensional states , and the current record is @xmath0-dimensional states @xcite . such kind of achievement is practically impossible for standard tomography techniques @xcite .",
    "we shall briefly comment on how weak measurements perform better for many cases in the next section .",
    "nevertheless , some severe disadvantages of weak - measurement applications have been exposed .",
    "a common trouble arises from the possible failure of weak value as the real pointer reading , especially when the weak value approaches infinity wu - li , pang , loren , zhu - zhang .",
    "it makes weak - measurement tomography not universal @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming also limits the performance of weak - value amplification @xcite .",
    "moreover , weak measurements suffer from serious quantum noise , which is usually argued as the inevitable price .",
    "for example , to suppress statistical error down to the same level , weak measurements require several orders of magnitude more samples than the standard tomography scheme @xcite . besides that ,",
    "the weak limit is inaccessible since only finite ( even though tiny ) coupling strength can be used in experiments .",
    "systematical errors are then introduced unavoidably and behave as inevitable bias in weak - value tomography @xcite .    instead of obtaining the weak - value information approximately as in the originally proposed measurement at the weak limit , in this article",
    ", we show that one can get it exactly in the original setup but with interaction of arbitrary strength , provided that the observable read on the pointer is properly chosen as a coupling - deformed ( cd ) pointer observable .",
    "this is our main idea .",
    "our method works for the whole regime of measurement strength .",
    "the exactness and the utilization of stronger measurements remove the problems of risky approximations and quantum noise in the determinations of weak values .",
    "particularly , in the weak - value tomography , our method requires only a slight alteration to the current experimental setting and thus can be realized in experiments straightforwardly .",
    "we arrange this paper as followed . in sec .",
    "[ section - aav formalism ] , we shall introduce the standard formulas of weak values and weak measurements , and the application in quantum state tomography . in sec .",
    "[ main section ] we give our main results on coupling - deformed pointer observables and demonstrate how our method solves the mentioned problems . in sec .",
    "[ section poor ] we propose methods against possible complexities arising in the method of cd observables .",
    "finally we discuss further implications and conclude this article in sec .",
    "[ section discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly introduce aav s perturbation formalism of weak measurements , and the applications of weak value in quantum state tomography .",
    "the model in consideration consists of a system to be measured and a pointer .",
    "suppose the system is initialized in the state @xmath1 . to measure observable @xmath2 , one couples the system to the pointer initialized in the state @xmath3 , via the typical unitary time evolution operator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is defined on the pointer and @xmath6 is the coupling strength ( assumed to be dimensionless ) .",
    "after that , the system is postselected into @xmath7 .",
    "if the coupling is weak enough , the unnormalized pointer state @xmath8 will be @xcite @xmath9this rough derivation suggests that if @xmath5 is the momentum operator and @xmath10 is the position operator ( @xmath11=i\\hbar $ ] ) , then pointer s @xmath10-reading will be shifted by @xmath12 . here @xmath13is known as the _",
    "weak value_. one can determine the real and imaginary parts of weak value , respectively , by measuring two pointer observables , which are usually denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the outcomes of such measurements , or the readings of the pointer , are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the subscript `` f '' denotes that the expectation values are conditioned on successful postselection .",
    "the postselection is equivalent to a projective measurement .",
    "thus the action of postselection and reading the pointer is equivalent to a measurement of @xmath16 on the entire system .",
    "it implies that @xmath17 where on the right hand side @xmath18 stands for the average value in the coupled joint state @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the identity operator ) is the probability of successful postselection . in the weak limit @xmath22 , @xmath23 will equal the denominator of @xmath24 , @xmath25 .      here",
    "we investigate applications to determine the unknown information incorporated in the weak value .",
    "these applications are classified into two categories , `` measurable complex values '' and `` conditioned average '' , in ref . @xcite . from the definition of weak value ( [ weakvalue ] ) ,",
    "it is obvious that the numerator @xmath26 is what we are really interested in , since the denominator is directly accessible in the projective measurements .    as the natural approach to acquire weak values ,",
    "weak measurements with postselections are employed in these applications . and",
    "in fact , these applications are different in the specific selections of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ". thus we shall not elaborate on them but merely focus on weak - value tomography , or direct measurement of quantum states .",
    "the numerator @xmath30 in the definition of @xmath24 is actually what one wants in weak - value tomography , since it gives the wave functions @xcite or the kirkwood - dirac distribution of general states @xcite . to see it , if @xmath31 ( the projector at position _",
    "and @xmath32 is the zero - momentum eigenstate @xmath33 , then @xmath34 where we have assumed the normalization @xmath35 .",
    "thus , it is the numerator that gives the wave function @xmath36 @xcite .    in the experiment by lundeen _",
    "et al_. @xcite , the pointer is played by photon s polarization initialized in @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . to get the weak - value information from measurements , the pointer observables , @xmath5 and @xmath10 ,",
    "are substituted with two pauli operators , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "explicitly , the formula for the numerator of @xmath41 is @xmath42 this equation also shows how the unknown wave function ( left - hand side ) is determined from the outcome of measurements ( right - hand side ) .",
    "the formula for mixed states goes in similar ways @xcite .",
    "the merits of weak - value tomography were highlighted in all the relevant references @xcite . in sharply contrast to the global inversion required in the standard tomography , the most striking feature of weak - value tomography is exhibited in the direct extraction of the wave function at each spatial point .",
    "the entire wave function can be generated in real time .",
    "the second merit is the simplicity of manipulation .",
    "the observable @xmath29 is chosen from the set @xmath43 .",
    "these projectors commute with each other , and correspond to one orthogonal basis of the hilbert space . to compare , the observables required in the standard tomography do not mutually commute . in the cases in which @xmath44 is a mixed state , the postselection should be extended to @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath21 is the identity operator ) .",
    "these postselections in weak - value tomography are compatible so that can be realized a single experimental setup .",
    "because of these factors , weak - value tomography was successfully applied in the estimation of high - dimension states , like 27 dimensional states in @xcite and 192 dimensional states in @xcite .",
    "one may wonder that why we do not directly measure the observable @xmath48 and @xmath49 . if the projective measurements of the two observables are available in the laboratory , perhaps that would be better .",
    "however , here they are written in the form of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it seems impossible to directly implement the measurements of them with the current capability .",
    "moreover , in the context of tomography , measuring the complete set of these observables is just another version of the standard tomography .",
    "the drawbacks of weak - measurement schemes come from the approximations and the weakness .",
    "the error of the approximations used in eq .",
    "( [ aavf ] ) is drastic when @xmath52 is close to zero @xcite . to avoid this trouble one should know enough information about @xmath44 , which seems impossible since @xmath44 is preassumed as unknown .",
    "it makes the method not universal @xcite .",
    "other problems , such as bias and inefficiency , have been mentioned above .",
    "these drawbacks are rooted in the original formalism of weak measurements and weak value and thus can not be solved trivially .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the concept of the coupling - deformed pointer observable , which permits us to extract the weak - value information exactly with measurements of any strength .",
    "[ fig-1 ] for an overview .    , and ends at the postselection of the system onto @xmath28 .",
    "aav s formalism requires the measurement to be as weak as possible ( left path in the figure ) . while we show that we can get the weak - value information using measurements at an arbitrary strength , say @xmath6",

    "for our purpose , a simple and fast nonperturbative approach is posteriorly proved to be much better .",
    "suppose @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then one has @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the component of @xmath60 in the null space of @xmath29 .",

    "suppose @xmath66 , momentum or position when the pointer is a continuous - variable system , or pauli operators when the pointer is a qubit system , or other observables of the pointer accordingly .",
    "then the expectation value of @xmath67 for the given coupling strength @xmath6 can be written in a compact form as    [ subequation ] @xmath68where @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "additionally , when the input state @xmath44 is not pure , the definition of @xmath71 becomes ambiguous . in this case , suppose @xmath72 .",

    "the result will hint at a sufficient condition for the extraction of weak - value information that is stronger than the weak limit .    under the condition that @xmath75 , the @xmath76-matrix elements read in the weak limit as    @xmath77    substituting eq .",

    "the formalism of the weak - measurement scheme is exact only in the weak limit , while the real experiments need a finite interaction strength .",
    "this discrepancy causes the bias , the deviation between the expectation of the estimator ( the reconstructed states ) and the real value of the estimated state . in weak - value tomography , this bias is confirmed to be very robust @xcite , i.e. , hard to be removed , while here it automatically disappears ( we presume the perfect implementation ) because of the exactness of our formalism in the whole range of coupling strength .    the most important improvement is the reduction of quantum noise . with our formalism , weak - value tomography can be implemented using stronger interactions",

    "the coupling between spatial wave function and polarization ( the pointer ) is realized with a rectangular sliver of a half - wave plate .",
    "the coupling strength is determined by the angle shift on the photons polarization . to implement stronger measurements , we just need to tune larger this angle .",

    "however , our results show that such interpretation is unnecessary .",
    "we hope this work could stimulate more sparks on theories and applications of `` weak '' measurements .    to summarize",
    ", we have developed a nonperturbative approach to retrieve weak - value information in measurements with post - selections . here",
    "the system - pointer coupling strength can be of any finite value , not necessarily small .",
    "to retain the original form of the weak - value , we can slightly modify the current weak - measurement scheme , and read the cd observables on the pointers instead .",
    "we also studied situations when such a modification is unnecessary , namely , the cd observables are @xmath6-invariant .",
    "this is meaningful for simplifying the experiments .",

    "<S> while the novel applications of weak values have recently attracted wide attention , weak measurement , the usual way to extract weak values , suffers from risky approximations and severe quantum noises . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show the weak - value information can be obtained exactly in strong measurement with post - selections , via measuring the coupling - deformed pointer observables , i.e. , the observables selected according to the coupling strength . with this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we keep all the advantages claimed by weak - measurement schemes and at the same time solve some widely criticized problems thereof , such as the questionable universality , systematical bias , and drastic inefficiency . </S>"
