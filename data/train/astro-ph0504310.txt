    "the magic collaboration started to build the telescope since the beginning of 2001 .",
    "the magic telescope entered the commissioning phase in october 2003 and had , since then , observed few different sources at different redshifts .",
    "the telescope is one of the so - called _ last generation _ cherenkov telescopes and can explore the electromagnetic spectrum starting well below @xmath0 .    besides magic@xcite , built at @xmath1 a.s.l.in the island of la palma ,",
    "canary islands , there are three other collaborations working with _",
    "last generation _ cherenkov telescopes : hess@xcite ( windhoek , namibia ) , cangaroo@xcite ( woomera , australia ) and veritas@xcite ( horseshoe canyon , arizona , usa ) . while these last three are actually an array of telescopes ( 4 cangaroo , 7 veritas and 4 , at the beginning , also hess ) , magic favoured the construction of a single , although huge , telescope , featuring @xmath2 of reflecting surface instead of @xmath3 as the other detectors do .",
    "nevertheless , a second telescope , clone of the first one , with the same dimensions and improven capabilities , is already foreseen for magic and should be operating in 2007 , by the time of the launch of the glast mission .",
    "the keystones of the single magic are the huge reflecting area , capable to collect even the few cherenkov photons emitted by low energy gamma , and the trigger , able to cope with the high rate of the night sky background , filtering it and let the data acquisition mostly deal with real atmospheric showers . in this way , magic should reach the lowest energy threshold among the cherenkov experiments .",
    "additionally , the overall mechanical design of the telescope , based upon a carbon - fiber _ filigree _ , allows the telescope to slew to a new position in less than 20 seconds , in order to follow up the grb since its early onset .",
    "magic it is not designed to give quick alerts of grbs , mainly because of its limited _ field of view _ of @xmath4 in diameter .",
    "nevertheless , it can react very quickly to alert coming from other detectors .",
    "in particular , magic is part of the gcn , the _ _ grb coordinates network__@xcite , made up mainly of satellites like swift , that can recognise grb events with its on - board detectors and can quickly react sending the celestial coordinates of the presumed grb event .",
    "gcn takes then care of broadcasting the data to ground instruments such as many optical telescopes and magic .    in this work , after a brief description of magic first observations , we provide some quantitative predictions on grb observation for magic , but most of all we show that magic is working , and due to its low energy threshold and fast repositioning capabilities can be the ideal detector to follow the early development of grb at high energies .",
    "magic has been in a commissioning phase since october 2003 . beyond technical runs , there was time also for some physics observations . both kind of runs were necessary to tune or improve the hardware of the detectors , and the first physics signals were ready in february 2004 .",
    "the first sources observed were the crab nebula and mkn  421 .",
    "both of these sources are a sort of _ standard _ sources : the crab has a steady flux that can be used to calibrate detectors , and mkn  421 , while not being steady , stays from time to time in a high state with fluxes few times bigger than the crab one .    these two sources were observed in winter 2003/2004 ( the crab nebula ) and during spring 2004 ( mkn  421 ) and both revealed signals well above the @xmath5 level .    data from 155-minutes of acquisition taken on april @xmath6 , 2004 with magic pointing at mkn  421 .",
    "the histogram of _ alpha _ for on- and off - source observations , are relative to different bin in _ size _ : 8001200 ( left ) , 12002000 ( middle ) and more than 2000 photons ( right ) . ]",
    "special attention must be given to fig .",
    "1 . it represents the data collected on april @xmath6 , 2004 pointing at mkn  421 that was in a high state .",
    "the so - called iact ( imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique ) used by magic , records for each event the directions of the cherenkov photons emitted during the shower development .",
    "the image is then analysed using a well - established technique that exploits the so - called _ _",
    "hillas parameters__@xcite .",
    "two hillas parameters have a particular importance in the figure : _ alpha _ and _ size_. _ alpha _ is related to the actual direction of the primary particle that initiated the shower , thus an excess in _ alpha _ must be seen in the direction of a source . _",
    "size _ is the number of photons making up the image and is related to the energy of the primary particles ( the more energetic is the particle , more photons appear in the image ) .",
    "the three figures show that the mkn  421 flare was well detected by magic at different energies , and the excess seen in the first figure with _ size _ ranging from 800 to 1200 photons is consistent with an energy well below @xmath7 .",
    "having shown that magic is effectively working , let us see what we expect from grbs .",
    "the main parameter influencing the grb observability is the telescope _",
    "_ duty - cycle__@xcite .",
    "the duty - cycle of the telescope was calculated as the fraction of sky area accessible to magic per year , where , to be accessible , the following conditions must be met :    * the sun must be below astronomical horizon or have a zenith angle @xmath8 ; * the minimum angular distance from the moon must be @xmath9 ; * the relative humidity of the air must be lower than 80% ; * the wind speed must be lower than @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation , using the weather data and ephemerides for year 2001 , gives a value slightly below 10% .",
    "this means that roughly @xmath11 of all grb alerts can be immediately pursued .",
    "once determined the fraction of grb observable , it is possible to estimate how many grb can be actually observed , that is , if their significance is above @xmath5 .",
    "the number of @xmath12 can be calculated using the li - ma formula : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , the so called _ quality factor _ , represents the efficiency of the analysis and is of order unity at low energies , @xmath15 is the actual acquisition time and the @xmath16 s represent the rates .",
    "each @xmath16 takes into account the particle flux , @xmath17 , and the detector sensitivity to the flux itself , expressed as the _ effective area _ of the telescope , @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , we have that the expected signal from the grb is : @xmath19 and the cosmic - ray background is : @xmath20 .",
    "the effective area of a cherenkov telescope is quite huge , reaching @xmath21 around @xmath7 and dropping to @xmath22 around @xmath23 .",
    "the grb flux is obtained extrapolating the power - law spectrum found inside the batse catalogues , taking also into account the cosmological cutoff due to the absorption of high - energy @xmath24 by the metagalactic radiation field via @xmath25 .    of paramount importance for a good observation of grbs is the delay between the grb onset and the time when magic can actually observe the grb .",
    "this delay sums up three different times :    1 .   the time needed by the satellite to recognise that a grb event may be going on ; 2 .",
    "the time elapsing between the sending of the alert by the satellite , the broadcast via gcn and the final acknowledgement by magic ( @xmath26 seconds ) ; 3 .   the slewing time needed by magic to point to the grb position ( @xmath27 seconds ) .",
    "it can be calculated that reducing this total delay from 1 minute to 15 seconds increases of a factor 5 the number of observable grbs .",
    "it should be noted also that the zenith angle , @xmath28 , enters the formulae for the rates . the number of observable grbs thus it is not obtained with a straightforward multiplication of the duty - cycle @xmath29 times the number of grbs expected to have a significance @xmath30 , but it is better expressed with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the duty - cycle in a given bin of zenith angle , @xmath33 is the number of grbs ( extrapolated from batse catalogues ) actually observable in a given bin of zenith angle and the sum is performed over all zenith angle bins .",
    "values of @xmath33 range between 5 and 24 , strongly depending upon the delays from the grb onset to the actual observation of the grb by magic , and the final result is that magic should observe @xmath34 grbs per year .",
    "the results exposed in this work show that magic is now operating and can be used to follow the grb events since its early onset .",
    "observations with cherenkov detectors below @xmath7 seem now attainable , even if the analysis of low - energy events is still a challenge and may require more work .    .",
    "the development and construction of the magic telescope was mainly supported by the bmbf ( germany ) , cicyt ( spain ) , infn and murst ( italy ) .",
