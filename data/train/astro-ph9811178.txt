    "the stars of the pg1159 spectral class ( 31 members ) constitute the intermediate evolutionary phase between the end of the constant luminosity phase  at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb )  and the beginning of the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling phase . probing their interior structure",
    "provides direct constraints on both classes of stars and may help to understand better the transition from agb to wds and the nuclear burning turn off process . a powerful method to probe the interior structure of the pre - wd stars and to determine some of their basic stellar parameters",
    "is given by asteroseismology .",
    "this is possible because 15 pg1159 stars and central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) of type [ wc ] , called gw vir stars from the prototype ( pg1159 - 035 ) , show multiperiodic luminosity variations which have been interpreted as nonradial g - mode pulsations . among them , ten are cspn , while five appear not to be surrounded by a nebula ( bradley 1998 ) .",
    "the nature of the luminosity variations of the gw vir stars was first proven to be stellar pulsation in the case of pg1159 - 035 itself ( winget et al .",
    "1991 ) . nevertheless , and despite the successful results from adiabatic models to which we will refer to below , the pulsation mechanism of the gw vir stars is still not well understood .",
    "although almost all authors agree that the pulsations should be driven by the @xmath1@xmath2 mechanism , based on the c / o cyclic ionization ( starrfield et al .",
    "1984 ) , a good agreement between spectroscopic abundances and observed pulsation periods has not been yet found ( bradley & dziembowski 1996 ) .",
    "a new element in this picture was recently added by dreizler & heber ( 1998 ) : their results suggest that the gw vir pulsations could be related to the nitrogen abundance . on the other hand , in the adiabatic pulsation field , theory may explain several observed phenomena as frequency splitting due to rotation and/or magnetic fields , period spacing of successive overtones , and variations around the average period spacing caused by mode trapping in the outer layers of the star ( kawaler & bradley 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the measurement of frequency and period spacing , which leads to accurate determination of rotation , weak magnetic fields , stellar mass , external layer masses , and even luminosity and distance , needs power spectra with low noise and high frequency resolution . for these reasons",
    "it is necessary to obtain long and nearly continuous data sets , such as those obtained by the whole earth telescope network ( nather et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the star hs2324 + 3944 ( hereafter hs2324 ) is one out of four peculiar members of the pg1159 spectral class showing strong h balmer absorption in their spectra ( dreizler et al .",
    "1996 ) , called `` hybrid pg1159 stars '' ( napiwotzki & schnberner 1991 ) or lgehpg1159 , following the notation scheme of werner ( 1992 ) .",
    "it has an effective temperature of ( 130000@xmath310000)k and a surface gravity @xmath4=6.2@xmath30.2 ( dreizler et al .",
    "recent new analysis of the hst - ghrs spectrum of hs2324 show that the c / he and o / he ratio ( 0.4 and 0.04 by number ) is as high as in ordinary pg1159 stars ( dreizler 1998 ) .",
    "therefore only the hydrogen abundance ( h / he=2 by number ) makes it unusual .",
    "hs2324 does not show direct signs of on - going mass loss from pcygni shaped line profiles , like several other luminous pg1159 stars ( koesterke et al .",
    "however , detailed line profiles from high resolution keck spectroscopy show evidence of mass loss in the order of roughly @xmath5 ( dreizler et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "regarding effective temperature and gravity , it belongs to the subgroup of luminous pg1159 stars which are in general central stars of planetary nebulae .",
    "however , differently from all the other known hybrid pg1159 stars , no nebula is detected around hs2324 ( werner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "hs2324 was discovered to be variable by silvotti ( 1996 ) .",
    "handler et al . ( 1997 ) , with more extensive observations , showed that at least four different frequencies were active and therefore that the gw vir hypothesis was the most likely . for other two hybrid pg1159 stars , the nuclei of a43 and ngc7094 , periodic light variations are only suspected ( ciardullo & bond 1996 ) .",
    "the interest for the variability of hs2324 is enhanced by its hydrogen abundance .",
    "the presence of h was generally considered as a inhibitor of pulsations ( stanghellini et al .",
    "first steps to test the effects of the presence of h in the driving regions have been undertaken by saio ( 1996 ) and gautschy ( 1997 ) .",
    "the models of saio ( 1996 ) do pulsate with 3@xmath6 of h mass fraction .",
    "the models of gautschy ( 1997 ) are able to reproduce the observed periods of hs2324 , with a very similar h abundance of 20@xmath6 by mass .",
    "for all the reasons stated above , hs2324 is a very interesting star : the analysis of its photometric behaviour at high frequency resolution may give important results not only for a detailed study of the star itself , but also for more general questions regarding the gw vir pulsation phenomenon .",
    "therefore we decided to carry out a multisite photometric campaign on hs2324 , which may be considered as a first step for successive more extensive campaigns .",
    "the multisite campaign on hs2324 was performed during 2 weeks in august ",
    "september 1997 , centered on new moon .",
    "the journal of observations in table 1 gives information on the observatories involved , telescopes and instruments used , and duration of the single runs .",
    "most observations were obtained using two or three channel photometers with bialkali photomultipliers ( emi9784qb for loiano , hamamatsu r647 for beijing and mcdonald ) , no filters , and an integration time of 10s , which was subsequently merged to 90s .",
    "the leak of sensitivity to periods shorter than 180s did not give us any trouble because no signals were detected in that range from a preliminary analysis of the photometer data alone .",
    "only the calar alto data were collected using a site#1d ccd , b filter , and an exposure time of about 20s ( first two nights ) or 40s ( following three nights ) for each datum ; the times between successive data points vary between about 70 and 100s .",
    "the error introduced by the different effective wavelengths of each detector has been evaluated to be not more than 5@xmath6 in amplitude .    despite the small number of participants in the campaign , only four",
    ", we obtained a good coverage , comparable with other multisite campaigns , thanks to the good weather conditions in most nights at the different sites .",
    "the complete ( and combined ) light curve is shown in figure 1 ; it has a total duration of 134.9 hours , with an overall duty cycle of 43@xmath6 . in the central part of the run ( 40.8 hours ) ,",
    "the duty cycle is 98@xmath6 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : @xmath7 time of the first maximum inside the data set .",
    "@xmath8 these frequencies are the most reliable ( see the text ) .",
    "in the power spectrum of hs2324 there is not any clear direct sign of frequency splitting .",
    "this may be due to different reasons .",
    "a very small rotation rate , with secondary ( m@xmath90 ) modes below the frequency resolution , seems quite unlikely because it would require a rotation period longer than about 9 days .",
    "a more realistic possibility is that the star has a low inclination , so that the amplitudes of the m@xmath90 modes are near the level of the noise .",
    "a third possibility is that the concentration of the peaks is so high that we are simply not able to recognize the modes splitted by the rotation .",
    "if a direct identification of the rotational splitting is not possible , the high number of peaks allows one to make use of statistical methods .",
    "first we constructed an histogram of the frequency separations between the signals listed in table 2 , excluding the linear combinations .",
    "the result was not significant : no preferred frequency spacings appeared .",
    "another attempt was done using all the peaks of the power spectrum higher than a fixed level ; we selected 49 frequencies and made the histogram . here",
    "also we did not get any significant result apart that all the peaks were never higher than the one day alias near 1011 @xmath0hz .    at this point",
    "we invoked a third method : we computed the dft of the amplitude spectrum , using two different subsets spanning 3501000 @xmath0hz ( all signals ) and 440500 @xmath0hz ( only high power signals ) .",
    "the resulting power spectra are shown in figure 6 ( left panels ) .",
    "considering the lower panel , the highest peaks are at 10.1 and 4.2 @xmath0hz ; a third peak at 2.5 @xmath0hz is clearly visible and more evident in the upper panel .",
    "let us focus our attention to the latter two ( for the first one we will give an interpretation below ) : their ratio , equal to 0.594 ( or 0.589 ) , is very close ( 1% level ) to the canonical value of 0.6 predicted by asymptotic theory for the ratio between l=1 and l=2 rotational frequency splitting .",
    "therefore the 4.2 and 2.5 @xmath0hz peaks might correspond to the frequency separation between m and m@xmath31 ( l=2 and l=1 ) modes .",
    "the corresponding rotation period of the star would be @xmath10 days .",
    "this result may not be considered definitive because the method used is very sensitive to noise . moreover",
    "the signal that we are looking for is not actually coherent : the constant frequency separation between the modes of the same overtone splitted by the rotation does not correspond , in general , to the separation between successive overtones , which is not constant in frequency ( but almost constant in our particular case , due to the narrowness of the high - power region ) . from this point of view",
    "a more appropriate  but not much less noisy  method to measure the frequency spacing is given by the autocorrelation of the dft ( press et al .",
    "the results of the dft autocorrelation , reported in figure 6 ( right panel ) , are less significant than , but do not contradict , those obtained from the dft of the amplitude spectrum .",
    "looking now at the peak near 10 @xmath0hz of figure 6 , its frequency separation is very close to that of the one day alias ; therefore we could conclude that it is actually produced by all the aliases of the signals .",
    "this conclusion would give more confidence in the rotational origin of the two peaks at 4.2 and 2.5 @xmath0hz . moreover comparing the power of these two peaks with that of the one day alias",
    ", we could suppose that the weakness of the m@xmath90 modes is actually due to the low inclination of the star .",
    "but with a deeper analysis ( testing the variations of the three peaks of figure 6 ( left panels ) when we subtract different signals from the hs2324 data ( prewhitening ) ) , we can easily demonstrate that the peak at about 10 @xmath0hz has at least two components : one at 10.6 @xmath0hz actually related to the one day alias and another one related to the separation between the two signals at about 474 and 485 @xmath0hz in the data dft .",
    "therefore it is more difficult to derive any consideration about the weakness of the m@xmath90 modes and the low inclination hypothesis does not have any support . on the other hand , we can also demonstrate that the origin of the 2.5 and 4.2 @xmath0hz peaks is strongly related to the separation between a few large amplitude signals .",
    "conclusion : if the frequency spacings of 2.5 and 4.2 @xmath0hz are actually due to the stellar rotation , the low inclination hypothesis can not be longer followed .",
    "the new even more simple picture would be the following : there are five l=1 triplet component candidates ( 474.1 and 476.6 @xmath0hz plus 389.1 , 391.7 and 393.8 @xmath0hz ) and there are three l=2 quintuplet component candidates ( 480.9 , 484.5 and 488.8 @xmath0hz ) .",
    "if we derive the frequency spacing from these values we obtain a rotation period of the star @xmath11 days , slightly different from the previous one",
    ". other possible multiplets might be present at 483.2 and 485.4 @xmath0hz ( l=1 ) , and 463.7 and 467.7 @xmath0hz ( l=2 ) .",
    "in this context we can also try to estimate the inclination of the star using the l=1 modes .",
    "following pesnell ( 1985)0 modes should be all excited at the same amplitude level ; the amplitude variations during the run must be excluded .",
    "therefore this estimate of the inclination of the stellar rotational axis must be considered very tentative .",
    "] we obtain an indication for @xmath12 .      the two peaks in the amplitude spectrum dft , described in the previous section , could also be due to the period spacing between modes with successive overtones . in figure 7 ( left panels )",
    "we show the dft of the period spectrum ( amplitude spectrum in the period domain ) . for the upper panel we used a subset of the period spectrum with periods between 1000 and 2857s , while for the lower panel we used a narrower part with periods spanning 20002273s . excluding the peak at about 46s , which is related to the one day alias as discussed in the previous section , the most significant period spacings are 18.8s and 10.4s ( at least in the lower graph ; in the upper graph the 10.4s peak appears more uncertain ) .",
    "their ratio is close ( accuracy better than 5% ) to the asymptotic value of @xmath13 , suggesting that 18.8 and 10.4s might correspond to the l=1 and l=2 period spacings . in this hypothesis , the differences between the two left panels of figure 7 suggest that the l=2 modes might be present only ( or mainly ) in the high - amplitude region between 2000 and 2273s .",
    "an attempt to confirm the hypothesis that the modes of hs2324 are equally spaced in period ( and not in frequency ) has been done applying the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( kawaler 1988 ) and the inverse variance technique ( odonoghue 1994 ) to the first 12 periods listed in table 2 ( excluding the linear combinations ) .",
    "the results , reported in figure 7 ( right panels ) , do not confirm that the modes are equally spaced in period .",
    "moreover , the lack of any significant period spacing further indicates that the period list is not complete .",
    "nothing may be said about the trapped modes phenomenon apart the following .",
    "the ratio between the frequencies of the highest peaks in the 380 and 475 @xmath0hz regions gives @xmath13/2 with an accuracy better than 1@xmath6 .",
    "this number was found in other gw vir stars , as rxj2117 + 3412 and the central star of ngc1501 ( bond et al .",
    "1996 ) , and is compatible with calculated trapping coefficients ( kawaler & bradley 1994 ) .",
    "when we discovered that the dft was unstable , we also tried to explain such apparent time dependence of the dft with a completely different quasi - periodic approach .",
    "we considered the hypothesis that the dft temporal instability was real and due to a very short life time of the oscillations , which were continuously excited and damped .",
    "we therefore applied to the hs2324 data the linear state space model developed by michael knig for the analysis of x - ray variability of agn ( knig & timmer 1997 , knig et al .",
    "the current version of this program requires uninterrupted and equally spaced datasets .",
    "moreover , in order to provide reliable results , the time scales to be investigated must be sampled at least ten times .",
    "the only part of our light curve which fulfills these criteria ( jd 9494.9 , after rebinning with 200s ) can be actually fitted with a period of 2134s and a damping time of approximately 3.5 periods .",
    "a further attempt has been done using a larger nearly uninterrupted part of the light curve ( jd 9495.7 ) , filling the small gaps with white noise or with synthetic data ( both techniques give same results ) .",
    "the results are slightly different in this case : 2154s and 3.1 periods . in both cases from a k - s test the residual is white noise with over 90@xmath6 probability . if we try to find a secondary period the results are unreliable ( damping time longer than the dataset ) , but in any case the inclusion of more frequencies does not improve the fit .    in figure 8 the fit from the linear state space model",
    "is compared with the multisinusoidal fit : the quality is comparably good . despite this partial success , we can not demonstrate that the damping time found is really a fundamental quantity , constant over at least some days .",
    "we would need several datasets ( ideally , but not necessarily coherent ) of at least one day length to reject or corroborate this hypothesis .",
    "moreover , the excitation time - scale obtained from the linear state space model appears to be very short respect to the growth rates obtained from gw vir non - adiabatic models . for these reasons",
    "the present results are not convincing enough to abandon the dft results . on the other hand",
    ", the inviting advantage of the quasi - periodic approach is the small number of parameters required to describe the light curve .",
    "unstable power spectra have been found also in other luminous pg1159 stars ( e.g. rxj2117 + 3412 ) and [ wc ] cspn ( e.g. ngc1501 ) variables .",
    "changes were observed down to the time resolution of several days ( bond et al .",
    "1996 , table6 ) .",
    "the results of our multisite campaign clearly show that the power spectrum of hs2324 contains several periodic signals ( about 20 or more ) .",
    "we therefore may exclude binarity to explain its variability , as already suggested by handler et al .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes are comparable with those of the gw vir stars . if we consider also that hs2324 is spectroscopically classified as a pg1159 star , the immediate interpretation is that its variability is due to high overtone g - mode pulsations .",
    "the high h abundance detected in hs2324 , about 17% in mass ( dreizler 1998 ) , is a very interesting and unique ( up to now ) element , which might help to shed light upon the driving mechanisms of the gwvir stars .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the presence of h was generally considered as an inhibitor of pulsations ( stanghellini et al .",
    "1991 ) . but",
    "this result was rather speculative because , until a few years ago , no h - rich pg1159 stars were known . with hs2324",
    "this question has gained importance .",
    "presently the real effects of the presence of h appear to be less severe from preliminary models of h - rich gw vir stars ( saio 1996 , gautschy 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection of hydrogen in the atmosphere of hs2324 does not necessarily imply that hydrogen is present also in the driving regions .",
    "however , hs2324 belongs to the subclass of luminous pg1159 stars which still show mass loss effects in strong uv / fuv lines ( koesterke & werner 1998 , koesterke et al .",
    "it is highly probable that hs2324 is also affected by mass loss which would inhibit an abundance gradient due to gravitational settling .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the atmospheric composition is also representative for the driving region .",
    "an unambiguous detection of mass loss and the determination of the mass loss rate has to await fuse ( far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) observations of the ovi resonance lines .",
    "however , the asteroseismological analysis is hampered by the fact that the dft appears to be unstable in time . in principle",
    "this is not a new phenomenon : it has been observed in the light curve of all luminous pg1159 and [ wc ] variables ( the term `` variable variables '' was therefore coined by s. d. kawaler ) .",
    "but in our case , as discussed in section 3.1 , this fact is probably due to a poor frequency resolution caused by an insufficient coverage .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it is not possible to obtain definite precision asteroseismology results from our data set .",
    "nevertheless a spacing of the signals is probably present in the dft and can be explained in two different ways .",
    "the most likely hypothesis is that we see the frequency spacing produced by the stellar rotation with a period @xmath10 days .",
    "the second possibility , which can not be completely excluded , is that we see the period spacing between successive overtones . in this case",
    "the period spacings , equal to 18.8 ( l=1 ) and 10.4 ( l=2 ) s , would imply a stellar mass of 0.67 ( l=1 ) and 0.70 @xmath14 ( l=2 ) using the interpolation formula of winget et al .",
    "this asteroseismological mass would be higher than the 0.59 @xmath14 value , found from spectroscopy plus evolutionary tracks ( dreizler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "but this discrepancy would not be very significant as it is possible that the interpolation formula of winget et al .",
    "( 1991 ) needs some adjustment because of the peculiar composition of hs2324 .    in an alternative interpretation we assumed that the dft instability was real and we applied the linear state space model ( knig & timmer 1997 ) to investigate the quasi - periodic nature of these variations . as discussed in section 5",
    ", this approach is also partially successful , but it also requires new longer observations to be confirmed . at the moment we can only speculate about the physical interpretation .",
    "do we see the coupling time between different g - modes or the damping of a single mode ? in principle , the quasi - periodic nature of hs2324 could even endanger the interpretation as g - mode pulsations .    in conclusion both",
    "possible interpretations of the apparent dft instability need a new bigger observational effort , which could be realized only with a larger number of telescopes in a wet - like campaign . if we adopt the hypothesis that the dft instability is only apparent , it is also possible to estimate the duration needed for such a campaign in order to be able to separate all the frequencies .",
    "if all the l=1 and l=2 frequencies were excited in the region between 450 and 500 @xmath0hz , where most power is concentrated , the average frequency separation would be about 0.4 @xmath0hz . in a more realistic case ,",
    "if only 50% of the frequencies were excited ( as in pg1159 , which is the gw vir star with the largest number of detected modes ) , a frequency resolution of about 0.8 @xmath0hz would be enough .",
    "therefore we would require a data set with a time base of about 1.7 times the data set analyzed in this paper .",

    "<S> this is probably due to a not sufficiently long ( and therefore not completely resolved ) light curve ; nevertheless an alternative hypothesis of a single damped oscillator may not be completely ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> if we adopt the first hypothesis , the high concentration of peaks between 455 and 500 @xmath0hz suggests the presence of both l=1 and l=2 high - overtone nonradial g - modes . </S>",
    "<S> the insufficient frequency resolution of our data does not allow to obtain definite precision asteroseismology results . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless a spacing of the signals is observed , probably due to stellar rotation with a period of 2.3 days . </S>",
    "<S> if the signal spacing was due to the successive overtones , the period spacings would be equal to 18.8 ( l=1 ) and 10.4 ( l=2 ) s. </S>"
