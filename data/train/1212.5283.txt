    "a considerable amount of research work has been carried out so far on the design and improvement of electronic devices which are based on the use of quantized adiabatic charge transport.@xcite moreover , under a surface - acoustic wave ( saw ) , the inelastic capture and tunneling escape effects on the non - adiabatic transport of photo - excited charges in quantum wells was also investigated.@xcite the underlying challenge is to produce a device with an accuracy for the quantized current of one part in @xmath0 on the plateaus .",
    "when this goal is achieved , one application of this device would be in metrology for standardizing the unit of current .    at the present time , a saw is launched on a piezoelectric heterostructure , such as gaas / algaas , and ghz single / few - electron pumps have been gaining close scrutiny due to the fact that the measured currents lie within the nanoamp range , high enough for the measured current to be suitable as a current standard .",
    "however , these pumps have so far been capable of delivering electrons / holes in each cycle of a sliding dynamic quantum dot ( qd ) , giving rise to a quantized current with an accuracy of one part in @xmath1 as reported in refs .",
    "interestingly , in ref . [ ] a measurement was carried out of the noise accompanying a @xmath2-ghz saw pump .",
    "it was observed in this experiment that the current near the lowest plateau , corresponding to the transfer of one electron per saw cycle , is dominated by shot noise .",
    "however , away from the plateau , the noise is attributed to electron traps in the material .",
    "there have been some attempts to increase the flatness of the plateaus by applying magnetic fields.@xcite    some time ago , a proposal was put forward by thouless@xcite which would make use of quantized adiabatic charge transport .",
    "this adiabatic approach involves the use of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron system subjected to a slowly - sliding periodic potential .",
    "relatively simple analysis indicates that in such a 1d system minigaps are generated in instantaneous electronic spectra as a function of the saw amplitude . with the use of a gate",
    ", the chemical potential can be varied by applying a voltage to the gate .",
    "consequently , when the chemical potential lies within a minigap , there will be an integral multiple of electron charge transported across the system during a single time period.@xcite in other words , by combining with the strong transverse confinement of a nanoribbon , the weal longitudinal saw potential has induced a series of dynamic ( sliding ) tunnel - coupled qds whose impenetrablewall is constructed through destructive interference of the electronic wave functions around a minimum of the saw potential . in principle , such an adiabatic - transport device could provide an important application , like a current standard .",
    "talyanskii , _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the physical mechanisms of quantized adiabatic charge transport in carbon nanotubes for a saw to produce a periodic potential required for miniband / minigap formation .    in the presence of a saw ,",
    "the scattering effects from impurities embedded in a 1d electronic system are expected to play an important role on the flatness of a current plateau .",
    "the current quantization should be completely smeared out when the level broadening from impurity scattering becomes comparable to the minigaps of dynamic tunnel - coupled qds .",
    "on the other hand , we can also simulate localized electron traps by superposing a series of negative @xmath3-potentials onto a saw potential within each spatial period .",
    "consequently , we expect a set of localized trap states occurring within the minigaps of dynamic qds .",
    "this provides an escape channel for the qd - confined electrons being carried by the saw .",
    "this trap mechanism is quite different from the impurity one@xcite where a spatial average with respect to the distribution of impurities within a dynamic qd is inevitable due to a saw .    in this paper , we consider a 1d dirac - like electron gas in a graphene nanoribbon in the presence of a saw .",
    "we will introduce two mechanisms for miniband formation .",
    "first , the nanoribbon is modulated by a longitudinal potential from a saw .",
    "secondly , the nanoribbon is periodically corrugated .",
    "we notice that the second mechanism does not lead to a quantized current but instead produces traps for dirac electrons , thereby limiting electron mobility .",
    "our numerical calculations reveal that localized electron trap states are an effective mechanism to adversely affect the adiabatic transport because the localized - trap levels lying within the minigaps are very sensitive to the phase of either the saw or the corrugation - induced potential . varying the weight or the position of the @xmath3-potential leads to different positions of localized trap levels within the minigaps of the nanoribbon",
    ". therefore , these inevitable fluctuations of the trap potential in a realistic system would most likely impede the current quantization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2saw ] , we present the formalism for calculating band structure with localized trap states for nanoribbons in the presence of a saw . in sec.[sec3saw ] , numerical results for nanoribbons in the absence / presence of a saw and those for corrugated nanoribbons in the absence of a saw are presented to demonstrate and explain the localized trap states within the minigaps .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these results are briefly summarized in sec.[sec4saw ] .",
    "the work done by talyanskii , _",
    "et al._@xcite on quantum adiabatic charge transport focused on the coupling between a semimetallic carbon nanotube and a saw .",
    "the electron backscattering from the saw potential is used to induce a miniband spectrum .",
    "the electron interactions enhance the minigaps thereby improving current quantization .",
    "the effect due to impurities in the carbon nanotube is averaged by a saw potential .    for the cases of a semimetallic carbon nanotube ,",
    "semiconducting carbon nanoribbon with applied saw potential and corrugated nanoribbon , the energy levels are given by the spectra of discretized 1d dirac hamiltonian ( see the appendix  a for detailed derivations )    @xmath4_{2n \\times 2n}\\ .\\ ] ]    the eigenvalue problem is defined within the spatial interval @xmath5 and assumes periodic boundary conditions . in this notation",
    ", @xmath6 stands for either the wave number @xmath7 of the saw potential or the wave number @xmath8 of an effective potential induced by the corrugation .",
    "the discretization of the hamiltonian is provided by the mesh @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    for either the carbon nanotube or graphene nanoribbon , the parameters for the hamiltonian matrix in eq .",
    "are given by    @xmath12    where we have introduced the saw and impurities combined phase    @xmath13 = \\lambda \\cos(k_{saw}x ) + v_0\\,\\theta(x - x_0)\\ , \\ ] ]    with @xmath14 the normalized saw amplitude , @xmath15 is the fermi velocity of graphene .",
    "additionally , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the normalized trap - potential amplitude and position of the short - range dynamic trap for electrons , respectively , and the trap is sliding together with the saw potential .",
    "the mass term involving @xmath18 is the original energy gap for the system in the absence of a saw . in case of a nanotube ,",
    "@xmath18 may be generated by a magnetic field . for a nanoribbon ,",
    "the gap is structural for the semiconducting nanoribbon @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the transverse electron wave number due to finite size across the ribbon . for nanoribbons , the explicit form for the phase introduced in eq",
    "can be found from the appendix  a.    as far as the minigaps are concerned , the effect due to the saw potential on the nanoribbon may be compared with corrugation . a sinusoidal corrugated semiconducting ribbon can be mapped on to a flat ribbon .",
    "the mapping introduces an additional @xmath21 term into the dirac equation , as described in appendix  a. this yields    @xmath22^{3/2}}+i\\frac{{\\cal c}^2k_c^3 } { 4\\delta_c^3(x)}\\,\\sin(2k_cx_n)\\right]\\ , \\\\ \\notag b_n = i\\hbar\\tilde{v}_fk_y^{(m)}\\,\\texttt{e}^{-2i\\alpha_c(x_n)}\\ , \\\\",
    "x}\\ , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where the corrugation - induced gap is given by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the normalized amplitude of the corrugation , and @xmath20 is the quantized wave number across the nanoribbon .",
    "in our numerical calculations , all the energies in figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , such as @xmath25 , @xmath18 and @xmath26 , are normalized to @xmath27 .",
    "the saw potential amplitude @xmath28 is also normalized to @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , all the energies in fig.[fig:3 ] , such as @xmath25 and @xmath18 , are measured in units of @xmath29 , and the corrugation amplitude @xmath24 is normalized to @xmath30 . besides , the transverse wave number @xmath31 in all the plots is scaled by @xmath32 . in this way , we are able to draw some universal conclusions concerning the effects due to minigaps .    in fig.[fig:1 ]",
    ", we compare the energy band structure of nanoribbons for two values of @xmath18 in the absence of electron traps .",
    "two values of @xmath20 were chosen ( light and dark colors ) to describe the two lowest energy levels ( see the discussions in the appendix  a ) .",
    "the minigaps are generated by a sliding dynamic qd and they oscillate as a function of the saw amplitude @xmath28 , as may be verified using perturbation theory , vanishing at values close , but generally not equal , to the roots of bessel functions . increasing or decreasing the value of @xmath18 results in a shift of the nodes on the graph as evidenced by comparing our results in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 determines not only the magnitude of the original gap in the absence of a saw but also the size of the minigaps in the presence of a saw .",
    "higher energy minigaps are partially closed by the energy levels corresponding to a larger value of @xmath20 ( not shown here ) .",
    "we now introduce electron traps into our nanoribbon by superposing a negative @xmath3-potential onto the saw potential so as to simulate a short - range coulomb interaction . in this case , the position of the trap is fixed in the moving saw frame of reference , which is quite different from embedded impurities in a nanostructure . in the moving saw frame , the embedded impurities are moving against the dynamic qds created by both the transverse dimension of the nanostructure and the longitudinal saw potential .",
    "this results in an average of the impurity effects with respect to these dynamic qds in the longitudinal direction . as seen in the results presented in fig.[fig:2 ] ,",
    "localized trap states occur within the minigaps once the weight of the trap potential @xmath33 becomes larger than @xmath34 .",
    "relative energy value of these trap states in the presence of saw is sensitive to the position @xmath17 of the trap within a dynamic qd .",
    "if we set @xmath35 , then the contribution to @xmath36 from the trap located in the nodes of the saw potential is fully compensated by the cosine term in eq .. as a result of this compensation , the localized trap states will disappear from the gap and minigap regions .",
    "if we extend the single - trap model employed in this paper to a uniform distribution of traps , the fluctuations in the phase term @xmath36 [ see eq . ]",
    "would fill up the entire minigap region with a delocalized trap band .",
    "consequently , the adiabatic approximation may not be applicable . in other words , to satisfy the adiabatic assumption , one must have dominance of the saw potential , i.e. , @xmath37 must be satisfied .",
    "we compare the results for saw - based dynamic qds in figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] with those for static qds created by corrugation on a graphene nanoribbon in the absence of a saw and electron traps .",
    "this we do by displaying in fig.[fig:3 ] the minigaps induced by the corrugation .",
    "we find from the figure that minigaps only exist for finite but small values of the corrugation amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "this means that these minigaps are generally much less than those induced by a saw . as a matter of fact , the existence of non - vanishing diagonal terms @xmath38 given in eq .",
    ", effectively mitigates the phase fluctuations in the off - diagonal terms @xmath39 .",
    "this keeps the minigaps open and the energy spectra robust even after traps have been introduced to cause a fluctuation in the phase term @xmath40 .",
    "finally , let us assume that a narrow channel is formed within a two - dimensional electron - gas layer lying in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "we will neglect the finite thickness of the quantum well for the heterostructure in the @xmath42-direction and consider the electron motion as strictly two dimensional .",
    "we will employ one of the simplest models for the gate - induced or etched@xcite confining electrostatic potential . in this way",
    ", a 1d channel is formed on the two - dimensional electron - gas layer and the dynamics of massive electrons can be modeled by a discretized 1d schrodinger equation . however , from numerical results ( not shown here ) , we find no evidence of the minigaps for this model , i.e. , the minigaps are the characteristics of dirac fermions .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated in this paper the energy band structure for graphene nanoribbons , embedded with a single electron trap , upon which a saw is launched .",
    "our results show that localized trap states appear in the minigaps .",
    "more importantly , the location of the trap state - energy level is determined by the positions of the trap with respect to the phase of the sinusoidal saw .",
    "consequently , the adiabatic approximation might not be appropriate whenever the minigap is less or comparable with the weight of a short - range @xmath3-potential for the trap ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in fig.[fig:1 ] , where there are no electron traps , a larger value of @xmath18 in the energy spectrum leads to a substantial increase in the number of minigaps as well as the ballistic current quantization .",
    "periodic corrugation of the nanoribbon may be used instead of a saw as a mechanism for inducing minigaps . those are expected to be less sensitive to the presence of charged impurities or electron trap potentials .",
