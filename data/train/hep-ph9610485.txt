    "in supersymmetric theories there are various possibilities of generating an intrinsic electric dipole moment ( edm ) in microscopic systems .",
    "first of all , the neutron has already a non vanishing edm in the standard model ( sm ) , due to the uneliminable phase in the ckm matrix , or , in other words , to the misalignment between the left eigenstates of the two yukawa matrices , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and to the charged current gauge interactions between the left - handed quarks , that make the misalignment physically significant .",
    "if further interactions are present , further misalignments and phases can become significant .",
    "for example , in the unified extensions of the sm the new gauge interactions make significant the misalignments among particles unified in the same gauge multiplet .",
    "nevertheless , without supersymmetry , due to the decoupling of heavy particles , these effects are suppressed at low energy by powers of the unification mass .    in the supersymmetric extensions of the sm ,",
    "one more possible source of flavour and cp violation is associated to the possibility that the scalar partners of quarks and leptons are not degenerate and point in different directions in the flavour space compared to the corresponding fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "models are often considered in which the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are flavour universal and real at some energy scale @xmath8 .",
    "this can happen in models in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector by gravity  @xcite ( in this case @xmath9 ) or when it is communicated by gauge interactions at relatively low energy  @xcite .",
    "these hypotheses allow to keep under control flavour changing neutral current processes and edms due to the mixings in the fermion - scalar interactions . in this case",
    ", effects coming from the non universal radiative corrections to soft breaking parameters have to be ascribed to the yukawa couplings .    as said ,",
    "when the gauge group is unified , some new phases and flavour mixings otherwise inexistent or unphysical can become significant . unlike what happens without supersymmetry , if its breaking is communicated to the observable sector at a scale where the gauge group is already unified , these further phases and flavour mixings can succed in contaminating the soft breaking matrices before the heavy particle decoupling make them harmless , giving rise to important effects  @xcite .    besides the quark and lepton sector and their scalar partner sector",
    ", a cp source can come from the hidden supersymmetry breaking sector of the theory . as a consequence",
    ", there can be cp violating effects in the observable sector not associated to a mixing matrix and to a consequent flavour violation . as a matter of fact , even in the flavour universality hypothesis , a cp violation in the hidden sector can make the soft breaking parameters complex since the beginning . in this case , the effects are very large unless the phases are forced to be small .    in this paper , we consider the effects of phases associated to the misalignment of two yukawa matrices , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in the hypothesis that the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are generation universal and real at an high energy scale @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the yukawa interactions are present until @xmath8 without worring about their origin .",
    "however the minimal unified models that we consider do not give correct unification predictions for the light fermion masses , showing that , differently from the mssm case , flavour physics can not be totally decoupled from unification physics .",
    "furthermore , minimal flavour effects could be comparable to minimal unification effects  @xcite .",
    "the order of magnitude of edms for the quarks @xmath2 , @xmath5 and for the electron @xmath10 depends in a crucial way on the gauge structure at the universality scale @xmath8 .",
    "we will consider therefore different gauge structures , from the minimal one ( su(3)@xmath11su(2)@xmath11u(1 ) ) to that one that unifies all fermions belonging to the same family ( so(10 ) ) , passing through the minimal unification ( su(5 ) ) , studying them from the point of view of the properties of edms under flavour transformations commuting with the gauge ones .",
    "this will allow us to give our estimates for quark and electron edms .",
    "we will consider the mssm in section  [ sec : mssm ] . in refs .",
    "@xcite the calculation of the down quark edm induced by a loop with charginos has been made using numerical methods with sometimes different results . for a given value of @xmath1 , @xmath12 , bertolini and vissani claim in fact that @xmath13 can be as large as @xmath14 , inui et al .",
    "obtain @xmath15 and abel et al .",
    "get @xmath16 , all of them indicating a linear dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical calculation is used in order to solve the matricial renormalization group equations for the yukawa couplings and the soft breaking terms ; this is necessary for doing a detailed analysis at the fermi scale .",
    "unfortunatly , in the low energy lagrangian , the particular flavour structure of the ckm cp violation , at the basis of the smallness of the edms , is hidden in a large number of flavour mixing matrices . on the contrary , by studying the edms directly in terms of the parameters at the universality scale , it is easy : i ) to estimate the order of magnitude of the effect , that for @xmath12 does not much exceed @xmath17 , ii ) to display the cancellation of contributions not containing the squared light yukawa couplings , that suppress the edms , iii ) to show the raise with @xmath0 of the @xmath5 quark edm .",
    "it is also possible to obtain the relation @xmath18 between the one loop dipoles of quarks @xmath5 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( that both contribute to @xmath13 ) .    from our estimates",
    "we see that the one loop supersymmetric effects are comparable with the sm ones  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that also supersymmetric contributions at higher loops are relevant .    in section  [ sec :",
    "unified ] we will consider unified theories . the possibility of edms for the neutron and the electron close to experimental limits in unified theories has been pointed out and analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the case of moderate @xmath1 , where it is associated to the gauge group so(10 ) .",
    "the big enhancement of the neutron edm in comparison with the mssm case is due to the fact that , unlike in the mssm , in a unified theory cp can be violated also when two eigenvalues of the same yukawa matrix are vanishing  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this , as other effects  @xcite , happens also in the su(5 ) case , but only when the @xmath2 quark is concerned . as the third generation yukawa coupling involved is the bottom one",
    ", the effect is proportional to @xmath4 . due to its possible interest",
    ", we also present the results of a numeric computation of @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath5 quark contribution , as the electron edm , turns out to be very small compared with @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude section  [ sec : unified ] with a short rivisitation of so(10 ) . in appendix",
    ", we give the general formulas for the one loop edms of up and down quarks and charged leptons in terms of the parameters of the lagrangian at the fermi scale .",
    "in this section we will study quark and electron edms in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , with real and generation - universal soft terms at some scale @xmath8 @xmath22 this model provides the minimal amount of cp violation and , consequently , the minimal contribution to @xmath13 in a supersymmetric theory with soft breaking terms generated at @xmath8 .    in the described hypothesis ,",
    "third generation yukawa couplings can not be , by themselves , a source of quark edms .",
    "in fact , let us suppose that we neglect the four light yukawa couplings in the quark sector , @xmath23 everywhere , a part for the mass that must be present in a loop diagram in order to provide the elicity flip .",
    "then , since the hypothesis is scale independent , cp violation disappears and the edms have to vanish .",
    "in fact , at @xmath24 the soft terms are universal and real , so that cp violation can only come from yukawa couplings .",
    "but , as there is a couple of degenerate eigenvalues in each yukawa matrix , all ckm phases can be eliminated using rotations in the 1 - 2 sector and phase redefinitions of the fields , just as in the standard model .",
    "more precisely , in the @xmath3 case we have to use a rotation of _ down _ left light generations , while in the @xmath20 case we have to use a rotation of _ up _ ones .",
    "this is because when we consider , for example , the edm of the quark @xmath5 , the @xmath25 mass eigenstate is fixed , and the possibility of rotating the @xmath25 and @xmath26 eigenstates is lost . in the limit of vanishing @xmath27 and @xmath28 , cp violation disappears from the theory , but also the lighest down mass eigenstate becomes not defined .",
    "thus the light yukawa couplings play a crucial role in generating the edms .",
    "let us now see in which way they intervene . to begin with a simpler case , let us consider the imaginary part of the @xmath29 term ( defined in appendix ) after one loop rescaling from @xmath8 to @xmath30 .",
    "this quantity , like the edms , vanishes in absence of cp violation and contributes to the edms themselves .",
    "the @xmath29 term does not depend on the basis in the flavour space in which the left doublets @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the right singlets @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are written .",
    "in other words , if we consider a transformation of the flavour components of the superfields @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 commuting with the gauge group , namely a @xmath41 transformation , the yukawa couplings become @xmath42 whereas the @xmath29 term remains invariant . for what follows , most important",
    "are the @xmath43 transformations .",
    "since at @xmath8 all the parameters in the tree level lagrangian except the yukawa couplings are invariant , it is convenient to consider the @xmath29 term at the fermi scale as a function of those parameters .",
    "actually , the relation between high and low energy yukawa couplings can be inverted , so that the yukawa couplings can be considered at the fermi scale .",
    "owing to the invariance relative to transformations of the right - handed quarks , @xmath29 depends on the yukawa couplings only through their squares @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . moreover , if two among the @xmath47 or @xmath48 eigenvalues are equal at @xmath8 , the yukawa couplings can be made real through a transformation   so that @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "therefore the rge corrections to @xmath49 must be proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , owing to the invariance relative to a generic @xmath51 transformation , @xmath29 is a sum of terms like @xmath52 { \\operatorname{tr}}\\bigl[({\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{e}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{e}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}})^k\\bigr ] a_{u , d}^0\\ ] ] with real adimensional functions of @xmath8 and @xmath53 as coefficients .",
    "the first non vanishing supersymmetric contribution to @xmath49 is then proportional to @xmath54 ( a_u^0-a_d^0 )   \\simeq \\lambda_t^4 \\lambda_b^4\\lambda_c^2 \\lambda_s^2   { j_{\\mathrm{cp}}}(a_u^0-a_d^0 ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , @xmath49 is furtherly suppressed by lepton yukawa couplings or by small effects due to the @xmath57-@xmath58 hypercharge difference .",
    "let us consider now the imaginary part of a flavour non - invariant quantity , more precisely the imaginary part of the matrix element of a quantity @xmath59 transforming as @xmath48 ( or of a quantity @xmath60 transforming as @xmath47 ) , calculated in correspondence of left and right mass eigenstates .",
    "the imaginary parts appearing in the expressions   in appendix for the edms and thus the edm themselves are examples of such quantities . in this case , the light yukawa coupling suppression is less strong and dependent on the mass eigenstate we consider , up or down , light or heavy .",
    "the general dependence of @xmath59 on the yukawa couplings is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 represents traces of @xmath63 and we suppose that @xmath64 is a real polynomial in the yukawa couplings , as it is for the one loop edms , where the yukawa couplings only come from vertices or supersymmetric rge corrections .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath58-@xmath25 matrix element is then proportional to the @xmath5 eigenvalue @xmath65 = \\lambda_d   { \\operatorname{im}}\\bigl [ f\\bigl({\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}},{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } } , { \\operatorname{tr}})_{d_l d_l}\\bigr].\\ ] ] moreover , in getting the dependence of @xmath66 on the light yukawa couplings , it is no longer possible to consider the limit @xmath67 or @xmath68 as above for @xmath29 , because in this limit the eigenstate @xmath25 , as @xmath58 , is no longer defined . therefore @xmath66 has not to be proportional to @xmath69 but only to @xmath70 , so that the necessary dependence on the yukawa couplings is @xmath71 \\propto \\lambda^4_t\\lambda^2_c\\lambda^2_b{j_{\\mathrm{cp}}}$ ] .",
    "the first non vanishing contribution to @xmath72 $ ] comes in fact from the term proportional to @xmath73 in the expression for @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the proportionality coefficient .",
    "since higher order terms are negligible , we have @xmath75\\simeq a\\lambda_{d_i}{\\operatorname{im}}\\bigl [ ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}})^2 ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } } ) ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } } ) \\bigr]_{d^l_i d^l_i}.\\ ] ] had we considered a matrix @xmath60 transforming as @xmath47 , we would have found @xmath76\\simeq b\\lambda_{u_i}{\\operatorname{im}}\\bigl [ ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}})^2 ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{u}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } } ) ( { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^\\dagger}{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\text{\\textsc{d}}}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } } ) \\bigr]_{u^l_i u^l_i}.\\ ] ] since the flavour dependence of the one loop edms is all contained in the arguments of imaginary parts in  , all the down edms are expressable in the previous form @xmath77 $ ] with the same @xmath59 , so as for the up ones we have @xmath78 $ ] with the same @xmath60",

    "show that the middle generations edms are the largest ones and allow to express the neutron edm in terms of only the @xmath2 and @xmath5 quark edms . using eqs .   and , and",
    "neglecting chromoelectric dipole moment contributions , we get in fact the estimate @xmath84    from eqs .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath85 is much smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "this is because the previous combination is invariant under flavour rotations of the quark fields and thus suppressed by both @xmath87 and @xmath88 , just as the rge induced phase of @xmath29 , electron edm , strong cp angle and 3-gluon operator  @xcite .",
    "owing to this large suppression , the @xmath29 term phase contributes to the neutron edm in a negligible way .",
    "show the strong rise of the edms with @xmath1 .",
    "the large @xmath1 region is therefore by far the most interesting one and it is the one that we will consider in the following . expressing all fermion masses in terms of the yukawa couplings , the weak vacuum expectation value @xmath89 and @xmath1 , the only dependence of edms on @xmath1 is in the left - right ( and r - l ) blocks of the scalar mass matrices that provide the `` elicity flip '' in the scalar sector . in the large @xmath1 region , @xmath90 so that the edms depend on @xmath1 only through the down yukawa couplings : @xmath91 . hence the down quark edms increase with @xmath0 , whereas the up quark ones increase with @xmath92 .",
    "let us consider now more closely how one loop graphs can give rise to the flavour structure of eqs .  .",
    "in both the @xmath20 and @xmath3 cases there are two relevant graphs ( see appendix ) involving either charginos or gluinos .",
    "the yukawa matrices necessary to obtain the flavour structure of eqs . and",
    "come from the rge corrections to the soft breaking parameters and ( in the case of chargino exchange only ) from the vertices .",

    "and of the behavior of the loop functions , it is @xmath96 for the chargino and gluino one loop contribution to @xmath20 respectively . in this and in the following estimates",

    "moreover ` @xmath99 ' stands , in each case , for the particular combination of soft parameters written in the analytical approximation . because of @xmath100 and of @xmath101 in eq .  , the corresponding contributions to @xmath3 are less interesting and totally negligible for moderate @xmath1 . at a closer inspection ,",
    "these estimates turn out to be correct within an order of magnitude .    as it is apparent from eq .",
    ", @xmath13 can not be much larger than @xmath17 for @xmath12 and than @xmath102 for whatever value of @xmath1 .",
    "we remark that , owing to the necessary presence of @xmath87 in all results for @xmath20 , a numerical calculation of the @xmath5 quark edm requires the knowledge of the low energy parameters with a precision of about @xmath103 in order to see the reciprocal cancellation of the terms not proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "it is at this point interesting to understand why the three - loop pure sm contributions to the neutron edm , @xmath104  @xcite , are not suppressed relative to the one - loop supersymmetric ones .",
    "a large suppression of the pure sm contribution would seem plausible because , in comparison with it , the supersymmetric one loop contributions can be enhanced by    1 .",
    "large logarithms , @xmath105 , that multiplicate the loop factors @xmath106 in the rge inserctions involved by the one loop supersymmetric diagrams ; 2 .",
    "@xmath1 factors , that can enhance the @xmath48 and @xmath107 couplings ; 3 .   a particularly small effective combination of susy parameters , ` @xmath99 ' .",
    "on the other hand , the sm contributions are enhanced in different ways .",
    "in fact , in the pure sm graphs ,    1 .",
    "the elicity flip can occur on an external leg , giving a factor equal to the `` constituent quark mass '' @xmath108 , equal for @xmath109 ( so that @xmath110 ) ; 2 .",
    "the yukawa couplings are expressed in terms of quark masses evaluated at low energy and therefore enhanced by qcd renormalization factors , as the strong coupling ; 3 .   unlike the rge - induced contributions , that must depend in a polinomial way on the yukawa couplings , the infrared structure due to subtractions of quark propagators in the sm graphs , give rise to a mild logarithmic dependence .",
    "point iii .",
    "is particularly important in the case of quantities neutral under the quark @xmath111 flavour group ( like the electron edm , or the phase of the @xmath29-term , or the strong cp angle , or the 3-gluon operator  @xcite ) that for this reason receive purely supersymmetric contributions much smaller than sm ones . due to the absolute lack of experimental interest ,",
    "we avoid discussing such issues in any detail .    other than one loop supersymmetric and three loop pure sm diagrams ,",
    "it is also possible to have higher loop contributions , not considered before , having the two kind of enhancement .",
    "an example can be obtained from the chargino one loop diagram by adding by adding a qcd loop , that allows elicity flip on the external lines and gives a contribution to @xmath20 comparable with the previously computed one .",
    "using charged higgs exchange , it is also possible to obtain an interesting three loop contribution to @xmath13 given by @xmath112 fine tuning considerations suggest that , in the large @xmath1 region , the charged higgs are lighter than the squarks  @xcite .    to conclude this section , let us note that the universality scale @xmath8 can be much smaller than the unification scale if the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted at relatively low energy by gauge interactions . in this case",
    "all rge - induced contributions to @xmath13 are smaller because of their strong dependence on @xmath113 , whereas the higher loop ones , and in particular , are not .",
    "in this section , we suppose that the gauge group is unified at the universality scale @xmath8 that we will identify with the reduced planck mass . in this case",
    ", edms can be much larger than in the mssm . as seen in the previous section , the smallness of edms in the mssm is due to the light yukawa couplings , that have to be present to prevent the removal of all phases from the lagrangian , phases that at the planck scale reside only in the yukawa matrices .",
    "in fact , with regard for example to the quark @xmath5 , if @xmath114 cp violation can be removed with independent redefinitions of the right down quark and of the left doublet .",
    "if the gauge group is unified , at the planck scale the phases still reside only in the yukawa matrices , but in this case mssm multiplets belonging to the same representation of the unified group can no longer be rotated independently .",
    "hence , depending on the gauge group and on the quark in consideration , cp violation can persist even if some or all of light yukawa couplings are vanishing , making not necessary their suppressing presence in the edm expressions .",
    "let us consider first minimal su(5 ) unification .",
    "one generation is composed by two multiplets , a five - plet @xmath115 and a ten - plet @xmath116 , and the higgs fields belong to two five - plets , @xmath117 , that transforms like @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , that transforms in the conjugate way . in terms of these fields ,",
    "the yukawa interactions are @xmath120 in a basis in which @xmath47 is diagonal . below the unification scale ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the same of the previous section .",
    "five of the six phases of the ckm matrix can be removed in the mssm through independent redefinitions of the @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "here , it is easy to show that only three phases can be removed by independent transformations of @xmath124 , @xmath125 , so there are two more physical phases compared to the mssm ( and the sm ) .",
    "whereas two phases decouple below the unification scale in non supersymmetric models , in supersymmetric models they leave their effects in soft breaking parameters , that loose their universality and reality , before decoupling could make them harmless .",
    "is the effect of these two further phases on the edms suppressed by light yukawa couplings in this model ?",
    "the answer is no for the quark @xmath2 and yes , but in a different way compared to the mssm , for down quarks and charged leptons . in order to show that , let us suppose first that the two light @xmath47 eigenvalues , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , are vanishing . in this case , all phases in the yukawa matrices become unphysical .",
    "in fact , the first of the two interactions   becomes @xmath128 and it is invariant for transformations in the @xmath129-@xmath130 sector .",
    "moreover , as it is well known , it is possible to write the most general unitary matrix @xmath131 as @xmath132 where @xmath133 are orthogonal @xmath134 matrices .",
    "then we can reabsorb @xmath135 by a redefinition of @xmath136 , reach the phase @xmath137 by defining @xmath138 and reabsorb also @xmath137 by a redefinition of @xmath139 , without affecting the diagonal interaction .",
    "since , as seen in the previous section , the limit @xmath114 is meaningful for the down quarks and for the charged leptons ( and for the top ) , this means that their edms are suppressed by light up yukawa couplings in some way .",
    "let us suppose now that the two light @xmath48 eigenvalues , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are vanishing . in this case ,",
    "two phases remain physical .",
    "in fact , the interactions   become @xmath140 with a redefinition of @xmath141 , one of the three phases of @xmath142 can be reabsorbed , but not the remaining two because , if they were reabsorbed by a redefinition of some @xmath124 , they would reappear in the diagonal interaction .",
    "the two remaining phases are just those ones related with unification . since the limit @xmath143 is meaningful for up quarks ( and the bottom and the tau ) , their edms are not necessarily suppressed by light yukawa couplings .",
    "the dependence of edms on yukawa couplings can be obtained as in the mssm .",
    "changing basis in the flavour space for the su(5 ) supermultiplets @xmath144 , @xmath145 corresponds to make a @xmath146 transformation on the flavour component of the fields , relative to which the yukawa couplings transform in this way : @xmath147    as before , the down quark edms are given by @xmath77 $ ] , where the matrix @xmath59 transforms as @xmath48 .",
    "unlike the case of the mssm , this does not mean that @xmath148 .",
    "in this case we have rather @xmath149 where @xmath64 depends on the arguments in such a way that @xmath150 for a transformation  . from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath27 as in the mssm .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 must depend on down yukawa couplings through their squares but it can depend on individual up yukawa couplings also through not squared couplings , provided that the total number of @xmath47 is even .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the particular flavour transformation @xmath151 , @xmath152 leaves @xmath45 and @xmath64 unchanged but it changes sign to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , unlike the mssm , a @xmath127 suppression can be enough for the quark @xmath5 .",
