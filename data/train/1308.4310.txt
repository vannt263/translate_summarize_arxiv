    "much interest has recently been devoted to improving our understanding of relaxation in isolated many - body quantum systems , fuelled in particular by example realizations using cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the combination of strong correlations and off - equilibrium initial conditions makes theoretical treatments arduous , in particular in one dimension where quantum fluctuations and nonperturbative effects are inevitable @xcite .",
    "the main focus of recent studies was to consider quenches @xcite in which a hamiltonian parameter is suddenly changed , and to investigate the late - time asymptotics of the system s properties .",
    "interestingly , although one naively expects that ergodicity generally leads to thermal gibbs distributions , it has now become clear that non - thermal distributions can sometimes occur , more specifically in circumstances in which nontrivial conservation laws exist . a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) must then be used , in which all conserved charges obtain their own effective temperatures , these being set by initial conditions @xcite .",
    "though extremely appealing , the implementation of the gge poses serious challenges , among which the fact that for many models conservation laws are difficult to handle ; calculating the generalized effective temperatures is usually impossible ( though exceptional cases where such calculations can be carried through exist @xcite ) .",
    "the gge was thus mostly implemented for theories which are mappable to free systems , for which the momentum occupation modes can be used as conserved charges @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we deal with a specific quench problem of recent interest @xcite , namely the interaction quench in the lieb - liniger ( ll ) bose gas and more specifically the release of the noninteracting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) ground state into a system with finite repulsive interactions . besides being of experimental interest @xcite , this case surprisingly",
    "can not be treated theoretically using the standard gge , due to creeping infinities in the expectation values of the conserved charges @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative approach has been proposed to deal with integrable systems with out - of - equilibrium initial conditions @xcite .",
    "this scheme , which is based on a generalized thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite , is a thermodynamically exact variational method using as input the overlaps of the initial state with the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian driving the post - quench time evolution .",
    "we refer to it as the ` quench action ' approach ; it was up to now only tested on free systems for which independent results were available .    using the quench action , we here provide an exact solution to the bec - to - ll quench problem .",
    "this allows us in particular to access the physical properties of the non - thermal steady state at long times after the quench , and represents to our knowledge the first example of a quench to a truly interacting system for which exact results are obtained in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results would be applicable to experiments in ring - like geometries @xcite or box - like potentials @xcite .",
    "the overall method we use , being quite generic , forms a blueprint for potentially treating many other quench situations .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 bosons on a one - dimensional ring of circumference @xmath2 and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our initial state is the ground state in the absence of interactions , _",
    "i.e. _  the bec state @xmath3 with @xmath4 . at @xmath5 ,",
    "we suddenly turn on interparticle interactions ; the time evolution is thus from that moment onwards driven by the lieb - liniger hamiltonian @xcite ( setting @xmath6 ) @xmath7 in which @xmath8 parametrizes the interaction strength .",

    "such a state has momentum @xmath17 and energy @xmath18 .",
    "higher conserved charges @xmath19 @xcite have eigenvalues @xmath20 .",
    "the norm of the wave function   is given by the determinant of the gaudin matrix @xcite .",
    "given such a basis of energy eigenstates , the exact time evolution of a generic normalized initial state @xmath21 can be formally written as @xmath22 where we introduced the logarithm @xmath23 of the overlap coefficient between a normalized bethe state and the initial state .",
    "the expectation value of a generic operator @xmath24 on the initial state at any time @xmath25 is then @xmath26",
    "the first challenge is to compute overlaps between the initial bec state and the bethe eigenstates .",
    "the only states with nonzero overlap with the bec state are parity - invariant bethe states such that for each positive rapidity its negative counterpart is also present . considering @xmath1",
    "even , we denote such states by @xmath27 where all @xmath28 are taken to be positive .",
    "the parity invariance is a straightforward consequence of the conservation of momentum and all other odd charges during the quench .",
    "this can be easily checked by computing matrix elements of the conserved charges @xmath29 with respect to the bec state and the bethe state , @xmath30    the overlap of the initial bec state with a parity - invariant bethe state is @xmath31 the matrix @xmath32 is of the same form as the gaudin matrix @xmath33 , but with a different kernel : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . expression ( [ eq : overlaps ] ) was analytically verified up to @xmath37 and then proven for arbitrary @xmath1 in ref .",
