    "magnetic quantum systems which displays a slow relaxation in the nonequilibrium dynamics are good candidates for magnetic data storage devices .",
    "low dimensional magnetic systems , including magnetic chains and magnetic molecules in molecule - based magnets , may allow for a substantial reduction of the size of memory units to perform classical computation @xcite .",
    "in addition , systems that develop quantum coherence in the nanometer scale may be of interest for the fabrication of quantum computers .",
    "quantum computation is believed , at least in principle , to be much faster than classical computation , and its accomplishment rests in the ability of a quantum system to be in a superposition of many quantum states ( _ entanglement _ ) .",
    "this property is the basis of the so called _ quantum parallelism _ , which presents a lot of advantages in relation to its classical counterpart , the one that is realized in a classical computer by connecting a large number of processors for parallel operation .",
    "still , there is another important requirement for doing efficient quantum computation , a condition that is related to quantum programming or quantum software : we need robust bell - like states , or stable entangled states devised through constructive interference from the many quantum states available .",
    "the coherence time of those states must be much larger than the time employed in 1-qubit or 2-qubit operations @xcite .",
    "the present contribution is related to this latter issue .",
    "it has been shown that quantum chains which are modeled through the heisenberg hamiltonian ( or variants such as the quantum @xmath0 model ) , are intrinsically entangled @xcite .",
    "the quantum @xmath0 model can be practically realized in low - capacitance josephson junction arrays @xcite ; it also appears as an effective hamiltonian for the interaction of quantum dot spins @xcite , and it is also relevant for other condensed matter and qed systems which have been proposed as quantum computers @xcite .",
    "one important role of the @xmath0 model in quantum computation is that it can be used to construct a _",
    "swap _ gate , which means that the time evolution can be consider as a source of entanglement @xcite .",
    "moreover , an interesting connection between quantum phase transitions and entanglement has been recently proposed , suggesting that entanglement plays an important role in quantum critical phenomena @xcite . concerning the anisotropic @xmath0 model , a quantum phase transition",
    "is found as a function of the anisotropy parameter and transverse field .",
    "the latter may be envisioned as a quantum metal - insulator transition with the formation of a gap for the insulating phase .    here , we are able to construct analytic solutions of the anisotropic @xmath0 model in the thermodynamic limit , which display a very slow relaxation after being prepared in a non - homogeneous initial state .",
    "this is a peculiar nonequilibrium problem , since our quantum system is closed ( does not exchange energy with the environment except when preparing the initial condition ) , and its relaxation to the homogeneous state is exclusively driven by quantum fluctuations and interference effects .",
    "nonequilibrium properties of quantum systems have been recently investigated by several authors following different approaches @xcite , but a complete theory is still lacking . to test our solutions , we also study finite systems through numerical calculations .",
    "finite systems are interesting for practical applications , like the ones mentioned above .",
    "an important question to answer is whether a finite system will show similar relaxation properties , at least during finite periods of time , and how to monitor the magnitude of such periods .    in spite that we solve a well defined model , some properties of the phenomenon seem to be universal for one dimensional systems .",
    "_ the key point addressed in this paper is how to prepare special long - lived superposition states in quantum magnetic chains , whose coherence is not wiped out by the strong destructive interference that appear at very long time_. we call those states as _ critical _ , for reasons that will be developed in the next sections",
    ".    a general nonhomogeneous initial state in a quantum spin chain can be fourier decomposed .",
    "we then study the nonequilibrium dynamics through the time evolution of the fourier component of the magnetization @xmath1 .",
    "this approach has several advantages in spite that @xmath2 is not an observable : one can probe the relaxation properties as a function of the wave vector @xmath3 , which is an important parameter in the theory , and for the particular case of the @xmath0 model ( and variants ) , the relaxation of the longitudinal component @xmath4 is independent of the initial state , except for a complex scale factor , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real universal function that depends on parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "we are interested in solving the anisotropic @xmath0 magnetic chain with spin @xmath7 in the presence of a transverse magnetic field @xmath8 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the exchange integral , @xmath10 is the external transverse field in units of the exchange constant , @xmath11 is the anisotropy parameter , @xmath12 is the total number of spins in the chain , and @xmath13 are spin 1/2 operators . special cases of this model are :    1 .   the isotropic @xmath0 model with a transverse field ( @xmath14 ) ; 2 .   the ising model with a transverse field ( @xmath15 ) ; 3 .",
    "no magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the chain is prepared in an arbitrary nonhomogeneous initial state and its magnetization dynamics is calculated in exact form under very general assumptions . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath17 ) , and for long times , the system displays irreversibility in the form of a power law relaxation .",
    "this irreversibility can be ascribed to quantum interference effects which encompass the system at asymptotically long times . in analogy with classical optics",
    ", we handle this phenomenon using the stationary phase method @xcite . as a general rule ,",
    "most of the components interfere destructively ( shadow regions ) , and the relaxation is dominated by the contribution of stationary points , where the interference is constructive ( illuminated zones ) .",
    "it may happen that some stationary points become degenerate in the parameter space . in optics , we get surfaces where the intensity of light diverges ( _ caustics _ ) . in our problem , we get critical states whose relaxation time asymptotically diverges , yielding a very slow relaxation",
    ". those critical modes do not occur in all cases , and we present a summary of our findings below .",
    "models i ) and ii ) were discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "also berim and cabrera @xcite and berim , berim and cabrera @xcite have solved similar problems for several versions of the 1-dimensional @xmath0 model , which include dimerization , bond alternation , and staggered magnetic field .",
    "all the models , including the one presented here , are amenable of exact analytic treatment by fermionization methods involving generalized jordan - wigner transformations @xcite .",
    "_ concerning relaxation properties , all the models studied can be grouped into two families , whether the energy spectrum has a gap or not _",
    "only gapped models develop critical modes with anomalously slow relaxation properties .",
    "it remains the question whether the above phenomenon is associated to a conservation law @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to study the behavior of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , since the anisotropy in the @xmath0 exchange and the transverse magnetic field lift the spin rotational symmetry and the time reversal symmetry , respectively .",
    "moreover , one can monitor the spectral properties ( gap or not ) with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the present study confirms the general prescription stated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 family , _",
    "i.e. _ anomalous long - time tails in the relaxation are features of gapped one - dimensional models . in this contribution , we will show that this anomalous slowing down of the relaxation is due to both , constructive quantum interference at degenerate or _",
    "critical _ stationary points and _ nesting _ properties of the spectrum .",
    "our calculation follows the general trends described in detail in ref .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , with periodic boundary conditions , is written in terms of fermion variables @xmath20 using the jordan - wigner transformation : @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the sign string that adjusts the anticommutation relations for the @xmath23@xmath24 for the fermion hamiltonian ( @xmath25hamiltonian ) , we solve the _ c - cyclic _ problem , where one neglects a correction term that comes from the boundary , as it is usually done when studying the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "the _ c - cyclic _ hamiltonian is diagonalized in two steps :    1 .",
    "we take the fourier transform @xmath27 with @xmath28 . at this stage ,",
    "the hamiltonian is not diagonal since the anisotropy couples the modes @xmath29 ; 2 .",
    "complete diagonalization is achieved with a bogoljubov transformation @xmath30 with real coefficients @xmath31 and hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant term and the quasi - particle dispersion relation is given by @xmath34 in the particle - hole representation , @xmath35 and the ground state is the vacuum for the @xmath36 operators .",
    "we note that the spectrum given by ( [ energy ] ) may present a gap as a function of the anisotropy @xmath37 and transverse field @xmath19 .",
    "several examples are available : 1 .   for @xmath15 ( ising with transverse field )",
    ", the spectrum presents a gap at @xmath38 of magnitude @xmath39 in units of the exchange constant , which shows that there is a critical value @xmath40 for the transverse field ; 2 .",
    "when @xmath16 ( no magnetic field ) , we get a gap at @xmath41 whose value is @xmath42 the isotropic @xmath0 model being gapless ; 3 .   with magnetic field and anisotropy ,",
    "when @xmath43 , the gap is positioned at @xmath44 , with value @xmath45 otherwise , its position and value are given by ( [ gap1 ] ) .",
    "once the ground state and excitations have been determined , we proceed to calculate the dynamical properties of the magnetization .",

    "we will denote those possibilities as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 labeling the possible field directions .",
    "the calculation follows the general trends described in ref .",
    "the details will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that the calculation of the dynamics of the transverse components @xmath53 and @xmath54 is much more involved , and it is not clear that one can obtain closed analytic formulae . for the above components we only obtained numeric results in small systems .    for the longitudinal component , we summarize the main steps of the calculation below :    1 .",
    "transform @xmath55 to fermion operators to get its time dependence .",
    "this step leads to : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the coefficients in the transformation ( [ bogoljubov ] ) .",
    "note that in ( [ mag ] ) there are contributions from processes that do not conserve the number of particles ; 2 .",
    "average with the initial density matrix .",

    "the asymptotic behavior , obtained through the _ stationary phase method _",

    ", the contribution of stationary points leads to an asymptotic relaxation with time in the form of a power law .",
    "we write @xmath75 where @xmath76 labels the stationary point of @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the number of stationary points and their degeneracy depend only on the parameters of the hamiltonian @xmath77 and the wave vector @xmath78 .",
    "the dominant time dependence of the @xmath79 functions in ( [ asymptotic ] ) is given by @xmath80 using the same notation as above .",
    "the important quantities in ( [ powerlaw ] ) are the relaxation rate @xmath81 and the exponent @xmath82 , which together determine the relative speed of the relaxation process . for the cases we calculated analytically",
    ", they are functions of @xmath83 or @xmath84 . in fig.1",
    ", we display the relaxation times as function of @xmath18 for a given value of the wave vector @xmath3 ( with @xmath16 ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is dominated by the contribution of five stationary points of @xmath85 : two of them are related to @xmath86 ( the points @xmath87 ) , a third one ( @xmath41 ) is associated with @xmath88 , and from the two remaining we get the same relaxation time @xmath89 .",
    "the times @xmath88 and @xmath89 become asymptotically large in the vicinity of a critical value of @xmath18 , which is indicated in the figure , where the corresponding stationary points become degenerate .",
    "some general comments are in order :    1 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior oscillates with a small number of frequencies @xmath90 , which are functions of @xmath83 or @xmath91 2 .",
    "we get a whole set of exponents @xmath92 coming from the different stationary points , but the relaxation for @xmath93 is driven by the smallest exponent @xmath94 ; 3 .   depending on their variation in the parameter space",
    ", some stationary points may become degenerate .",
    "this fact drastically affects the relaxation . as remarked before ,",
    "the @xmath95 s asymptotically diverge in the neighborhood of critical points .",
    "exactly at the critical values , one has to go some steps further in the asymptotic expansion ( as many as the order of the degenerate point ) , yielding a discontinuous change of the @xmath94 exponent . in the example of fig .",
    "1 , the exponent @xmath94 changes from @xmath96 to @xmath97 at the critical @xmath98 , signaling a slowing down of the relaxation process ; 4 .   the above instance",
    "occurs at the loci of the _ critical _ curves @xmath99 in the parameter space , with @xmath100 given by : @xmath101 for the ising case with transverse field , and @xmath102 for the anisotropic case and no field .",
    "note that the gapless cases @xmath103 and @xmath104 yield @xmath105 , which is an ordinary stationary point . also note that the pure ising case @xmath106 has no dynamics and has to be treated separately .",
    "the above results are exact in infinite chains , where the thermodynamic limit implies a continuous spectrum .",
    "in contrast , finite systems present quantum recurrences , with partial or total reconstruction of the initial state .",
    "for very small samples , we are able to identify a number of rabi - like periods associated with the revival of the magnetization .",
    "numerical computations show that those periods or quasi - periods become longer with increasing sizes , scaling almost linearly with @xmath12 .",
    "this poses the question of how to define the time interval during which the finite system approximate the infinite system in a regular way , in the spirit of finite - size scaling methods . to estimate the relaxation ,",
    "we have adopted the following procedure : _ a ) _ we numerically analyze the dynamics of finite systems until the first partial reconstruction ( this time depends on size and @xmath18 ) , and ; _ b ) _ we fit the time evolution to a power law similar to the one given by ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "this is not an easy task , since there are several frequencies superimposed . a typical behavior of the magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath107 and for the same @xmath3 wave vector of fig.1 .",
    "we estimate the exponent from the envelopes of local maxima and minima , which are shown in the figure . in fig .",
    "3 , we display a summary of our findings for @xmath107 spins .",
    "one observes a precursory slowing down of the relaxation around the critical value predicted for the infinite chain ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , with a typical rounding due to size effects . we comment those results further in the next section .",
    "one interesting feature of the anisotropic @xmath0 model is the absence of any spin conservation law ( we exclude the pure ising limit without transverse field ) .",
    "this fact makes its dynamics  ` richer ' than the one associated with other models , where the total spin or one of the total spin projections are conserved @xcite .",
    "this appears as a source of entanglement , which is relevant for applications in quantum computation .",
    "another peculiarity of the @xmath0 model is exhibited in ( [ scale ] ) and ( [ sz ] ) , meaning that the dynamics of the longitudinal fourier component of the magnetization is independent of the initial state , which enters just through a scale factor in the form of an average over the initial condition .",
    "this property is not shared by other models , like the heisenberg @xmath108 model , where we found a strong dependence of the relaxation process on the initial state @xcite .    from our analytic and numeric computations , we were able to identify long - lived collective excitations , which have the character of dynamic spin density waves with incommensurate wave vector @xmath100 . in the vicinity of @xmath109",
    ", we get @xmath110 asymptotically , thus reducing the damping of those excitations in relation to a general wave vector @xmath3 .",
    "exactly at the point @xmath99 , the exponent @xmath94 changes discontinuously @xmath111 and the relaxation time @xmath95 has a finite value .",
    "note that _ critical _ modes only appear when the spectrum has a gap , in agreement with findings in other models of the @xmath0 family @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results may be physically realized in a number of systems , from which the most promising to perform quantum computation are josephson tunneling junction arrays .",
    "quantum bits ( ` qubits ' ) stored in low - capacitance josephson junctions ( jj ) simulate mesoscopic spins , and the coupling between jj units mimic the spin - spin interactions that are usually found in several spin models @xcite ; in particular one can obtain an effective anisotropic @xmath0 coupling with a gap in the spectrum .",
    "nonhomogeneous initial states considered in this paper , could be practically achieved in jj systems by locally manipulating gate voltages , tunneling barriers or magnetic fields .",
    "this way , one may implement exact prescriptions to prepare those long - lived collective excitations as many times as necessary to perform specific tasks in a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "those states ( which are not stationary states ) , are obtained by constructive interference from a macroscopically dense number of quantum states .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the degeneracy of stationary points and the critical condition are associated to nesting of the one - particle spectrum around inflection points of the dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "this peculiarity confers a degree of  ` robustness ' that is still present in finite systems , as shown in our example with @xmath107 , and leads one to expect that quantum coherence will be maintained within operational levels when in contact with the  ` outside world ' .",
