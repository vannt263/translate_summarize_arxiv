    "in recent years the d - branes attract much attention to investigate several aspects of superstring theories .",
    "much of the studies of d - branes have been done in the flat background and it is natural to extend the analysis to the curved background . in the case of wzw models ,",
    "the studies of d - branes were started about ten years ago @xcite .",
    "recently the geometrical aspects of d - branes in wzw models were investigated in @xcite and the stability of d - branes was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the d - branes are described by so called boundary states in the conformal field theory and we can analyze perturbatively .",
    "it is known that the orientifolds can be also expressed by the crosscap states @xcite in the conformal field theory , however the orientifolds have not been much investigated like d - branes .",
    "nevertheless it is important to study the orientifolds because they can be used to study the string duality and to construct the configuration with less supersymmetry .",
    "the orientifolds of wzw models were studied in @xcite by the algebraic methods .",
    "very recently , the geometrical aspects of the orientifolds of wzw models were studied in @xcite and it is interesting to apply to other configurations .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the orientifolds in the parafermionic theories , which are obtained by the @xmath1 wzw models gauged by the @xmath2 sector , e.g. , @xmath0 coset wzw models @xcite .",
    "these models appear in superstring theories on some backgrounds .",
    "for example , the near horizon geometry of ns5-branes can be described by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the space parallel to the ns5-branes .",
    "the radial direction @xmath5 is given by the liouville theory and @xmath6 can be described by the @xmath1 wzw models .",
    "moreover the parafermionic theories are used to describe the string theory on two dimensional black hole @xcite or singular calabi - yau manifolds @xcite , which can be described by the @xmath7 wzw models .    the study of d - branes in @xmath8 wzw models was started by @xcite in the context of gepner models and the geometrical picture of d - branes in the parafermionic theories was given in @xcite . some branes which preserve maximal symmetry",
    "can be obtained in the rational conformal field theory by cardy construction @xcite , which will be called as a - type branes followed by @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also constructed new types of ( b - type ) boundary states which can not be obtained by cardy construction .",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath9 orbifold of parafermionic theory is t - dual to the original theory .",
    "therefore we can construct new type boundary states by applying @xmath9 orbifold and t - duality .",
    "for example , in @xmath2 wzw model , a - type boundary states represent the branes satisfying dirichlet boundary condition and b - type boundary states represent the branes satisfying neumann boundary condition . in the parafermionic theory ,",
    "the target space is given by the disk with radius one .",
    "in the paper @xcite , a - type branes were determined as d0-branes at the boundary of the disk and d1-branes connecting the points of the boundary .",
    "moreover b - type branes were determined as d0-brane and d2-branes at the center of the disk .",
    "the recent developments about d - branes in coset wzw models were given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the orientifolds in the parafermion theory .",
    "the cardy type orientifolds are known @xcite and they will be called as the a - type orientifolds . we construct the new type ( b - type ) orientifolds by using @xmath9 orbifold and t - duality and identify the geometry of these orientifolds .",
    "a - orientifolds are the @xmath101-planes connecting the opposite boundary points and b - orientifolds are the @xmath100-plane at the center of the disk and @xmath102-plane wrapping the whole disk .    the organization of this paper is as follows ; in section 2 , we review the known results of orientifolds which are constructed by the crosscap state technique .",
    "the spectrum can be read from the amplitudes between the boundary states or the crosscap states and it is very important consistency condition that there appears only integer degeneracies . in section 3 , we investigate the orientifolds of the simplest case , namely , @xmath2 wzw models .",
    "we can construct b - type orientifolds from a - type ones even in this case .",
    "the orientifolds of @xmath2 wzw models are the well - known ones in the one dimensional free bosonic theory ; a - type ones can be identified as @xmath100-planes and b - type ones as @xmath101-plane . in section 4 ,",
    "we construct the orientifolds in the parafermionic theory . as we said above",
    ", there are a - type and b - type orientifolds and we examine the spectrum in the direct channel of the amplitudes .",
    "the geometry of orientifolds can be seen by the spectrum or by scattering with the closed string states as we explain in appendix b. in section 5 , we extend the analysis to the supersymmetric case and obtain the results similar to the bosonic theory .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the conclusions and discussions . in appendix",
    "a , the several functions and their modular transformations are denoted . in appendix b , we review the method to determine the geometry of branes by scattering the closed string states @xcite and identify the shape of orientifolds by applying this method . + * note added : * in the revised version , the geometry of a - type orientifolds is corrected and the spectral flow identification is reconsidered .",
    "the results agree with the ones in the recent preprint @xcite .",
    "in the presence of orientifolds , the partition functions can be obtained by the klein bottle worldsheet in addition to the torus one .",
    "if we add the open string sector , we have to consider the mbius amplitudes and of course the annulus amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes have to satisfy the constraints corresponding to the modular invariant . in this section ,",
    "we use the rational conformal field theory and we later analyze the specific models .    the modular invariant condition of the torus amplitudes is well - known . the torus amplitudes can be written as @xmath11 where we use @xmath12 as the character of the representation @xmath13 and the moduli @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the torus amplitudes must be invariant under the modular transformations , in other words , @xmath16 and @xmath17 transformations @xmath18 the famous ones are given by the charge conjugation modular invariant @xmath19 and the diagonal modular invariant @xmath20 .",
    "the analysis of orientifolds is usually given in the charge conjugation modular invariant , however we will use the diagonal modular invariant in the subsequent sections .    when applying the orientifold projection , we have to add the klein bottle amplitudes .",
    "the orientifold operation is given by the combination of the worldsheet orientation reversal ( @xmath21 ) and the space @xmath22 isometry ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "then the klein bottle amplitudes are given by @xmath24 where we define @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the central charge of the model .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 are the integers and they are related to how the fields behave under the orientifold operation , which must be consistent with opes of the fields @xcite .",
    "the modulus of the klein bottle is @xmath28 and @xmath16 transformation interchanges the direct channel and the transverse channel . in the transverse channel ,",
    "the klein bottle amplitudes are given by the overlaps between the states called as crosscap states @xmath29 the coefficients @xmath30 are obtained by the one point amplitudes with the closed string @xmath13 and the coefficients @xmath30 determine the crosscap states .",
    "the equations ( [ kb1 ] ) and ( [ kb2 ] ) are transformed by @xmath16 transformation each other .",
    "therefore we obtain the constraint of the coefficients as @xmath31 which is the important condition to construct the crosscap states .    the open string sector is included in the presence of d - branes .",
    "the annulus amplitudes are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the labels of the boundary conditions , in other words , the labels of d - branes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 are the non - negative integers .",
    "the transverse channel can be obtained by the overlaps between the boundary states @xcite , which describe d - branes , as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the one point disc amplitudes with the boundary condition @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath16 transformation connects the equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) and this constraint is known as the cardy condition @xcite ; @xmath38    the analysis of mbius strip amplitudes is a little more complicated than the other cases .",
    "it can be seen that the following characters are convenient to study the mbius strip amplitudes @xmath39 the transformation from the direct channel to the transverse channel can be obtained by the @xmath40 ) is defined by the square root of the phase shift under the @xmath17 transformation . ] matrix @xcite . in @xmath1 wzw model , this matrix can be written as @xmath41 where we use @xmath42 the modulus of mbius strip can be assigned as @xmath28 and @xmath43 transforms @xmath44 .",
    "the mbius strip amplitudes in the direct channel are given by @xmath45 where there is only one boundary condition @xmath37 and the coefficients @xmath46 are the integers .",
    "the amplitudes in the transverse channel are obtained by the overlaps between the crosscap states and the boundary states @xmath47 as we said above , the modular transformation is given by @xmath43 transformation , thus the constraint becomes @xmath48 the presence of @xmath43 matrix in this equation makes things different from the case of the annulus amplitudes .",
    "moreover we have to care about so called completeness conditions @xcite .",
    "the following set of crosscap states and boundary states which obey all consistency conditions was obtained @xcite by the coefficients @xmath49 if we use the verlinde formula of the fusion coefficients @xmath50 and define the integer valued tensor as @xcite @xmath51 the amplitudes can be obtained as @xmath52 let us see the example of @xmath53 wzw models .",

    "the results are given by two type orientifolds , which are called as b - type and b-type ones .",
    "first , we concentrate on the b - type ones and they are given in the even @xmath144 case as @xmath224 where b - type ishibashi crosscap states are defined in the same way as b - type ishibashi boundary states .",
    "the orientifold projection given by this crosscap state can be seen by the klein bottle amplitude @xmath225 the geometry of b - type orientifold can be identified as @xmath100-plane located at the center of the disk , which can be determined by the scattering with the closed string states as in appendix b. it can be seen that this b - type orientifolds originate from the @xmath100-plane parts of a - orientifolds .",
    "thus the geometrical description of @xmath9 orbifold and t - duality gives the same result .",
    "the mbius strip amplitudes with the boundary states can be obtained just as a - type crosscap states .",
    "the amplitudes with b - type boundary states are given by @xmath226 and the amplitudes with a - type boundary states are obtained as @xmath227 where we use the character @xmath228 defined above ( [ chi  ] ) .",
    "we can also obtain the other ( b-type ) crosscap state by @xmath9 orbifold procedure and t - duality and this state is given by @xmath229 the klein bottle amplitude between this crosscap state is @xmath230 the geometry of this orientifold is also determined by scattering with the closed string states in appendix b. there we show that this orientifold is @xmath102-plane wrapping the whole disk .",
    "the b-type orientifolds originate from the @xmath101-plane parts of the a - orientifolds .",
    "thus , summing all images and performing t - duality gives the same geometrical interpretation .",
    "the mbius strip amplitudes with b - type branes are given by @xmath231 and the amplitudes with a - type branes are obtained as @xmath232 where we again use the character ( [ chi  ] ) .",
    "in order to apply to superstring theories , we have to extend the previous analysis to the supersymmetric one .",
    "although @xmath233 supersymmetry is included in super parafermionic theory , the supersymmetry is enhanced to @xmath234 .",
    "we study the closed strings and d - branes in super parafermionic theory in the next subsection and the orientifolds in subsection 5.2 .",
    "the construction of orientifolds can be proceeded just as the bosonic case and we get the similar results .",
    "this theory is known as @xmath234 minimal model and is given by @xmath235 coset wzw models .",
    "the hilbert space of super parafermionic theory is given by the decomposition as @xmath236 where the labels run @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "the states with @xmath240 are in the ns sector and the ones with @xmath241 are in the r sector . just as the bosonic case , there are the spectral flow identification @xmath242 and the restriction of the label @xmath243",
    ". we will call the distinct irreducible representation of super parafermionic theory as @xmath244 and the characters as @xmath245 .",
    "the lowest conformal weights are given by @xmath246 and the conformal weights of the fields outside this region can be obtained by making use of the spectral flow .",
    "the modular transformation matrix is given by @xmath247 and the fusion coefficients are @xmath248 the diagonal modular invariant is given by @xmath249 and this theory has the global symmetries which are generated by @xmath250 we will use the orbifold procedure as @xmath251 symmetry , which is generated by @xmath252 .",
    "let us study d - branes in super parafermionic theory .",
    "the a - type cardy states can be constructed in the usual way as @xmath253 where @xmath254 are ishibashi states in super parafermionic theory .",
    "the geometric picture of a - branes is given as follows .",
    "the target space of super parafermionic theory is the disk with fermions and it is convenient to use the disk with @xmath255 special points by making use of the bosonized fermions @xcite",
    ". then the geometry of d - brane described by @xmath256 is determined as d1-brane , which is the straight line connecting @xmath257 separated points .",
    "the label @xmath146 can be changed by the @xmath258 rotation of the disk .",
    "the label @xmath259 means the spin structure and the states with @xmath259 and @xmath260 describes the d1-branes with opposite orientation .",
    "the annulus amplitudes are given by @xmath261 we should note that the bra state @xmath262 has the same orientation with @xmath263 .",
    "we can see that there is no tachyon in the open string spectrum of the annulus amplitudes between the same branes .",
    "the b - type cardy states are similarly constructed by using @xmath264 orbifold and t - duality .",
    "the orbifold procedure restricts the labels of ishibashi states to @xmath265 and @xmath266 and we will only use @xmath188 states by using the spectral flow identification ( [ spfi ] ) . performing t - duality converts from a - type",
    "ishibashi states to b - type ones .",
    "the a - type ishibashi states can be obtained by the decomposition @xmath267 and we can apply t - duality just as the bosonic case by making use of the operator @xmath268 as @xmath269 where @xmath270 are defined by ( [ br - r ] ) .",
    "now we can construct the b - type cardy boundary states as @xmath271 and these states represent d2-branes at the center of the disk .",
    "since we sum over only @xmath266 , the label of the distinct states is given by @xmath272 , which corresponds to the spin structure .",
    "the label @xmath146 is only used to be survived by the selection rule @xmath273 .",
    "therefore there are @xmath274 states with odd @xmath144 . in even @xmath144 case , there is special @xmath197 state in addition to @xmath275 states .",
    "the general @xmath183 states are non - orientable and do not have rr charges .",
    "in fact , they are unstable because there are tachyons in the open string spectrum of the annulus amplitudes between b - type boundary states @xmath276 on the contrary , the state with @xmath277 is orientable and has rr charge , moreover it is free of tachyons in the open string amplitudes between this type of boundary states .",
    "the detailed analysis was given in @xcite , and we do not deal with this state for simplicity .    the annulus amplitudes between a - type and b - type boundary states can be obtained by using the overlaps between a - type and b - type ishibashi states as @xmath278 the character @xmath109 as in ( [ chi ] ) does not appear since there are the @xmath2 sectors in the both sides of the equation ( [ decompose ] ) .",
    "thus the amplitudes are given by @xmath279 which are independent with the labels @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "the crosscap states in super parafermionic theory can be constructed just like the bosonic case by using the @xmath43 matrix @xmath282 where we used the @xmath2 @xmath43 matrices as @xmath283 the last term of ( [ spfp ] ) is included because of the spectral flow identification just as ( [ pfp ] ) .",
    "the a - type orientifolds can be obtained by the solution ( [ bs ] ) as @xmath284 where @xmath285 are ishibashi crosscap states in super parafermionic theory .",
    "these states represent @xmath101-planes connecting the opposite points of the boundary . by applying the simple current technique ,",
    "we can obtain the solution ( [ bs2 ] ) @xmath286 which are the same as the previous ones just as the bosonic case .",
    "we can calculate the klein bottle amplitudes as @xmath287 we should note here that the bra state @xmath288 corresponds to the same orientifold described by the ket state @xmath289 . if we apply to superstring theories , one might be able to remove tachyons by performing appropriate gso projection .",
    "the mbius strip amplitudes with a - type branes are given by @xmath290 and the amplitudes with b - branes are obtained as @xmath291 where the characters are defined just like the bosonic case ( [ chi  ] ) as @xmath292    the construction of b - type orientifolds can be made by @xmath293 orbifold and t - duality as before .",
    "performing t - duality makes b - type ishibashi crosscap states from a - type ones just as the b - type boundary states .",
    "b - type cardy crosscap state is given by ( only for even @xmath144 ) @xmath294 which is the @xmath100-plane at the center of the disk .",
    "the orientifold projection is given by taking the right - mover of the diagonal modular invariant ( [ spfdmi ] ) with phases as @xmath295 there are tachyons in the direct channel spectrum of the amplitude .",
    "these tachyons are related to the fact that we are dealing with the system with the diagonal modular invariant ( [ spfdmi ] ) .",
    "therefore if we apply the correct gso projection , we can remove these tachyons and make the system stable .",
    "furthermore we can calculate the mbius strip amplitudes with the boundary states in super parafermionic theory .",
    "the mbius strip amplitudes with b - type branes can be given by @xmath296 and the amplitudes with a - type branes are obtained by using the characters @xmath297 as @xmath298    the b-type orientifolds can be also constructed by @xmath251 orbifold and t - duality and we obtain @xmath299 which is the @xmath102-plane wrapping the disk .",

    "in this paper , the orientifolds of parafermionic theories are investigated .",
    "the d - branes in parafermionic theories were analyzed in @xcite and they determined the geometry of d - branes by scattering with the closed string states .",
    "the geometry of orientifolds can be also determined by scattering the closed string states and we summarize in appendix b. the paper @xcite also constructed the new type of branes called as b - type branes . in @xmath8 wzw model , it can be seen that the @xmath9 orbifold is t - dual to the original theory .",

    "the same method can be applied to the orientifolds of parafermionic theory .",
    "the cardy type orientifolds , called as a - type orientifolds , were constructed in @xcite . in our case , there are a - type crosscap states ( [ a - planei ] ) which are the solutions of ( [ bs ] ) .",

    "the extension to the supersymmetric case is also discussed in section 5 .",
    "it is known that the d2-branes in @xmath1 wzw models can be thought of the bound states of d0-branes @xcite .",
    "this fact can be used to define the d - brane charges and they can be classified by twisted k - theory @xcite . therefore it is interesting to calculate the k - theoretic d - brane charges in the system with orientifolds of wzw models just like flat space analysis @xcite .",
    "the extension to the orientifolds of other backgrounds are also interesting , for example , more general coset wzw models .",

    "then , we get the similar result ( [ g - a - plane ] ) except for @xmath341 . thus this part corresponds to the @xmath101-plane on the line segment between @xmath336 and @xmath337 . by combining two parts",
    ", we can see that the crosscap state ( [ a - planei ] ) describes @xmath101-plane connecting the opposite boundary points of the disk .",
    "the d - branes in the compact wzw models with finite @xmath144 are not exactly localized and are smeared out @xcite",
    ". however the orientifolds are obtained by the combination of @xmath22 orbifold and worldsheet parity transformation , hence the orientifolds should be sharply localized even in finite @xmath144 .",
    "this is the remarkable contrast to the d - branes in finite @xmath144 .    the geometry of b - type crosscap state ( [ b - planei ] ) can be also determined by scattering with closed strings . using the legendre polynomials",
    "@xmath342 as @xmath343 we can get @xmath344 where @xmath345 and @xmath346 means complex conjugate .",
    "we also used @xmath347 as the usual theta function ( 1 for @xmath348 and 0 for others ) .",
    "the last line in the above equation can be obtained by using the generating function of legendre polynomials @xmath349 in the large @xmath144 limit , @xmath350 goes to zero , thus we can conclude that the b - type orientifold ( [ b - planei ] ) is @xmath100-plane located at the center of the disk @xmath351 .",
