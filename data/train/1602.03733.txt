    "is referred to as the _ trivial knot _ , or just an unknotted circle in 3-space .",
    "there are other ways to create mathematical knots aside from rope .",
    "for example , _ stick knots _ are created by gluing sticks end to end until a knot is formed ( see adams  @xcite ) . in 2008 ,",
    "lomonaco and kauffman  @xcite developed an additional structure for considering knots which they called _",
    "knot mosaics_. in 2014 , kuriya and shehab  @xcite showed that this representation of knots was equivalent to tame knot theory , or knots with rope , implying that tame knots can be represented equivalently with knot mosaics .",
    "this means any knot that can be made with rope can be represented equivalently with a knot mosaic .",
    "+ a _ knot mosaic _ is the representation of a knot on an @xmath0 grid composed of 11 tiles as depicted in figure  [ f : tiles ] .",
    "a tile is said to be _ suitably connected _ if each of its connection points touches a connection point of a contiguous tile .",
    "several examples of knot mosaics are depicted in figure  [ f : example ] .",
    "it should be noted that in figure  [ f : example ] , the first mosaic is a knot , the trefoil knot , the second mosaic is a link , the hopf link , and the third is the composition of two trefoil knots ( remove a small arc from two trefoils then connect the four endpoints by two new arcs depicted in red , denoted by @xmath1 ) .",
    "a knot is made of one component ( i.e. one piece of rope ) , and a link is made of one or more components ( i.e. one or more pieces of rope ) . for this work , we will focus on knot mosaics of _ prime knots_. a prime knot is a knot that can not be depicted as the composition of two non - trivial knots . the trefoil is a prime knot .",
    "@xmath2 respectively . ]",
    "+     +     +     +    when studying knots , a useful and interesting topic used to help distinguish two knots is _ knot invariants_. a knot invariant is a quantity defined for each knot that is not changed by _ ambient isotopy _ , or continuous distortion , without cutting or gluing the knot .",
    "one such knot invariant is the _ crossing number _ of a knot .",
    "the crossing number is the fewest number of crossings in any diagram of the knot .",
    "for example , the crossing number of the trefoil is three , which can be seen in figure  [ f : example ] . a _ reduced _ diagram of a knot is a projection of the knot in which none of the crossings can be reduced or removed .",
    "the fourth knot mosaic depicted in figure  [ f : example ] is an example of a non - reduced trefoil knot diagram . in this example",
    "the crossing number of three is not realized because there are two extra crossings that can be easily removed . + an interesting knot invariant for knot mosaics is the _",
    "mosaic number_. the mosaic number of a knot @xmath3 is the smallest integer @xmath4 for which @xmath3 can be represented on an @xmath0 mosaic board .",
    "we will denote the mosaic number of a knot @xmath3 as @xmath5 .",
    "for the trefoil , it is an easy exercise to show that mosaic number for the trefoil is four , or @xmath6 . to see this ,",
    "try making the trefoil on a @xmath7 board and arrive at a contradiction .",
    "+ next , we introduce a technique that can be used to  clean up \" a knot mosaic by removing unneeded crossing tiles .",
    "in 1926 , kurt reidemeister demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot , up to ambient isotopy , can be related by a sequence of three moves , now know as the reidemeister moves  @xcite .",
    "for our purposes , we will consider two of these moves on knot mosaics , the mosaic reidemeister type i and type ii moves as described by lomonaco and kauffman  @xcite . for",

    "+ the mosaic reidemeister type i moves are the following :            the mosaic reidemeister type ii moves are given below :                next we make several observations that will prove useful .    [",
    "o : twofold ] once the inner tiles of a mosaic board are suitably placed , there are only two ways to complete the board so that it is suitable connected , resulting in a knot or a link  @xcite .    for any given @xmath0 mosaic board , we will refer to the collection of inner tiles as the _",
    "inner board_. for example , in figure  [ f:5by5 ] the tiles @xmath8-@xmath9 would make the inner board for this mosaic board .",
    "[ o : evenall ] assume @xmath4 is even . for a board of size",
    "@xmath4 with the inner board consisting of all crossing tiles , any resulting suitably connected mosaic will either be a @xmath10 component link mosaic or @xmath11 component non - reduced link mosaic , see figure  [ f:4_1 ] for example .    [",
    "o : oddall ] assume @xmath4 is odd . for a board of size",
    "@xmath4 with the inner board consisting of all crossing tiles , any resulting suitably connected mosaic is a non - reduced knot mosaic .    observation  [ o : oddall ] can be generalized in the following way .",
    "[ o : corner ] let @xmath12 be a knot mosaic with two corner crossing tiles in a top row of the inner board .",
    "if the top boundary of the row has an odd number of connection points , then a reidemeister type i move can be applied to either corner of the row of @xmath12 .",
    "this extends via rotation to the outer - most columns and the lower - most row of the inner board .",
    "[ fig:5by5 ]    armed with this quick introduction to knot mosaics , we are ready to determine the mosaic number for all prime knots with a crossing number of eight or fewer in the next section .",
    "before we proceed , it should be noted that there are many other questions to consider regarding knot mosaics besides finding the mosaic number .",
    "for example , what is the fewest number of non - blank tiles needed to create a specific knot ? this could be known as the _ tile number _ of a knot . with this in mind , if we allow knot mosaics to be rectangular , can some knots have a smaller tile number if they are presented in a rectangular , @xmath13 configuration as opposed to a square configuration ? we will conclude this article with a number of other open questions about knot mosaics that you can consider and try to solve . +",
    "in this section , we will determine the mosaic number for all prime knots of eight or fewer crossings .",
    "we are referring to these as  small \" prime knots .",
    "we will see that for some knots , the mosaic number is  obvious , \" while others take some considerable work .",
    "we begin with knots is the second knot of six crossings in the rolfsen knot table  @xcite . ] of an obvious mosaic number as shown in table  [ t : obvious ] .",
    "+ why do these knots have obvious mosaic numbers ?",
    "as previously noted the trefoil knot , @xmath14 , can not fit on a @xmath15 mosaic board , as such a board would only allow one crossing tile when @xmath14 requires at least three crossings .",
    "hence , the mosaic number for the trefoil is obvious .",
    "similarly , the knots @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 have more than four crossings , so they can not fit on a @xmath19 mosaic board which only allows at most four crossing tiles . in the appendix , we have provided representations of these knots on @xmath20 mosaic boards , thus determining the mosaic number for these knots .",
    "it should be noted that as the knots become larger , it is often difficult to determine whether a specific knot mosaic represents a given knot . to check that a knot mosaic represents a specific knot , we used a software packaged called knotscape  @xcite developed by professor morwen thistlethawite which looks at the dowker notation of a knot to determine the knot presented . while knotscape can not determine all knots , it can determine small prime knots . for more see adams  @xcite .",
    "+ next we consider knots whose mosaic number is  almost obvious . \" at first glance , one may think that the figure - eight knot , @xmath21 , should have a mosaic number of four .",
    "start with a @xmath19 mosaic with the four inner tiles being crossing tiles . by observation  [ o :",
    "twofold ] , this @xmath19 mosaic can be completed in two ways as seen in figure  [ f:4_1 ] . however , the knot @xmath21 is known as an _ alternating _ knot .",
    "an alternating knot is a knot with a projection that has crossings that alternate between over and under as one traverses around the knot in a fixed direction .",
    "so , if we were to try to place @xmath21 on a @xmath19 mosaic , there would be four crossing tiles and they would have to alternate . thus @xmath21 can not be placed on a @xmath22 board . in the appendix",
    "we see a presentation of @xmath21 on a @xmath20 mosaic board , hence @xmath23 .",
    "another knot with an almost obvious mosaic number is @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ f : compare6_1 ] first depicts a configuration of @xmath24 on a @xmath25 mosaic board .",
    "however , by performing a move called a _ flype _ ( see adams  @xcite ) we can fit @xmath24 on a @xmath20 mosaic board . it should be noted that this mosaic representation of @xmath24 has seven crossings instead of six .",
    "thus the mosaic number for @xmath24 is realized when the crossing is not .",
    "it turns out that @xmath24 is not the only knot with such a property .",
    "ludwig , evans , and paat  @xcite created an infinite family of knots whose mosaic numbers were realized only when their crossing numbers were not .        at this point , we have determined the mosaic number for all six or fewer crossing knots except @xmath26 .",
    "surprisingly , we will see that @xmath26 can not fit on a @xmath20 board , even though such a board has nine possible positions to place crossing tiles .",
    "+      since @xmath26 has six crossings , we know that @xmath28 . in the appendix we see a representation of @xmath26 on a @xmath25 mosaic board , so @xmath29 .",
    "this mean @xmath30 or @xmath27 .",
    "we now argue @xmath27 .",
    "+ assume to the contrary that @xmath31 . by the definition of the mosaic number ,",
    "this implies that there is some @xmath20 mosaic @xmath12 that represents @xmath26 .",
    "we will show via a case analysis that regardless of how the crossing tiles are arranged on @xmath12 , the resulting knot is in fact _ not @xmath26_. this will give us a contradiction , implying that @xmath27 .",
    "+ in order to help with the case analysis , we label the nine inner tiles of the @xmath20 mosaic @xmath32  @xmath33 , as depicted in figure  [ f:5by5 ] .",
    "the @xmath26 knot uses at least six crossing tiles .",
    "since @xmath26 has a crossing number of six , by the pigeon hole principle at least one of the four corner inner tiles , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath33 must be a crossing tile . by rotations , it is enough to consider the four cases that are depicted in figure  [ f : fourcases ] .",
    "note that in figure  [ f : fourcases ] , gray tiles describe non - crossing tiles and white tiles could be crossing tiles ( but they do not have to be ) .",
    "* case 1 * : suppose that @xmath34 is a crossing tile , while @xmath36 , and @xmath33 are not .",
    "thus @xmath37 and @xmath38 are all crossing tiles since @xmath12 has exactly 6 crossing tiles .",
    "every reduced projection of an alternating knot is alternating , and since @xmath12 represents the alternating knot @xmath26 , the crossings on @xmath12 must alternate .",
    "a quick inspection shows that to suitably connect the inner tiles of @xmath12 we would need to ensure that ( i ) @xmath36 , and @xmath33 are not crossing tiles , ( ii ) the crossings are alternating , and ( iii ) there are no easily removed crossings , however this results in a mosaic that represents @xmath18 , as seen in figure  [ fig : ex1 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 can not be constructed in case 1 .",
    "* case 2 * : for the case when @xmath12 has two corner inner tiles that are crossings , we require two sub - cases . + * sub - case 2(a ) * : suppose that @xmath32 and @xmath34 are crossing tiles , while @xmath35 and @xmath33 are not .",
    "if @xmath39 is a crossing tile then observation  [ o : corner ] may be applied to the top inner row of @xmath12 . applying this observaiton",
    "will either change @xmath32 or @xmath34 to a non - crossing tile . without loss of generalization ,",
    "suppose that @xmath32 is changed .",
    "notice that @xmath12 now satisfies case 1 , and from the previous analysis , @xmath12 does not represent @xmath26 .",
    "therefore we may assume that @xmath39 is not a crossing tile .",
    "since @xmath12 has at least 6 crossing tiles , and @xmath40 and @xmath33 are not crossing tiles , the remaining 6 inner tiles must be crossing tiles .",
    "then @xmath39 has @xmath41 connection points . by observation  [ o : corner ] either @xmath32 or @xmath34",
    "can be changed to a non - crossing tile .",
    "again @xmath12 falls into case 1 and does not represent @xmath26 . + * sub - case 2(b ) * suppose that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are crossing tiles while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not .",
    "+      assume to the contrary that @xmath12 only has @xmath42 crossing tiles .",
    "then exactly one of @xmath43 is a non - crossing tile .",
    "up to rotation and reflection , we only need to consider situations ( i ) and ( ii ) , where            since @xmath12 has 6 crossings , the corner inner - tiles @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not be changed from crossing tiles . with this in mind , suitably connecting the crossing tiles in figure  [ f : case2(b)inner ] so that a knot ( and not a 2-component link ) is created leads to @xmath18 or @xmath46 ( see figure  [ f : case2(b)knots ] ) .",
    "this is a contradiction , proving our claim .        if the crossing tiles are alternating , then @xmath12 represents @xmath47 , contradicting that @xmath12 is @xmath26 .",
    "so assume that @xmath12 has 7 crossings and is non - alternating .",
    "+ observe that if any of the pairs @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 are non - alternating , then a type ii reidemeister move is present , and @xmath12 can be reduced to five crossings .",
    "however , this contradicts that @xmath12 is @xmath26 .",
    "so each pair @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is alternating . since @xmath12 is non - alternating , at least one of the pairs @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or @xmath56 is non - alternating .",
    "without loss of generality , assume @xmath53 creates a pair of non - alternating crossings . then , up to ambient isotopy , @xmath12 is @xmath24 or @xmath14 , as seen in figure  [ fig_6131 ] .",
    "therefore sub - case 2(b ) does not result in @xmath26 .",
    "* case 3 : * suppose that @xmath57 and @xmath33 are crossing tiles , and @xmath35 is not",
    ". since @xmath12 has at least 6 crossings , there must be at least 3 more crossing tiles on the board .",
    "+ observe that if either @xmath39 or @xmath58 are crossing tiles then observation  [ o : corner ] may be applied to the top inner row or the right inner column , respectively . as a result of this , one of the crossings on @xmath57 and @xmath33",
    "can be changed to a non - crossing tile , leaving only two corner inner - tiles that are crossings .",
    "this reverts to case 2 showing that @xmath12 would not represent @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we may assume that neither @xmath39 nor @xmath58 are crossing tiles .",
    "+ with @xmath39 and @xmath58 eliminated as crossing tiles , @xmath59 and @xmath33 must all be crossing tiles",
    ". then by observation  [ o : corner ] , either @xmath34 or @xmath33 can be changed from a crossing tile to a non - crossing tile .",
    "this again reverts to case 2 showing that @xmath12 would not represent @xmath26 . + * case 4 : * suppose that @xmath60 and @xmath33 are crossing tiles . note that at least one of the tiles in the set @xmath61 must be a crossing tile .",
    "this means observation  [ o : corner ] applies to some row or column of @xmath12 , and @xmath12 can be reduced to case 3 .",
    "hence @xmath12 does not represent @xmath26 .",
    "+ by the above four cases , we see that the @xmath26 can not be placed on a @xmath20 mosaic . hence , by the figure for @xmath26 in the appendix , we see that the mosaic number of @xmath26 is six ; that is @xmath27 .",
    "we next consider the seven - crossing knots .",
    "as seen above , the knot @xmath47 can be placed on a @xmath20 mosaic board .",
    "we formalize this result in the following proposition as well as establish the mosaic number for the other seven - crossing knots .",
    "+    [ t:7 - 4 ] the mosaic number of @xmath47 is five , that is @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 is the only seven - crossing prime knot with mosaic number five ; the remaining seven - crossing prime knots have mosaic number six .",
    "we have already seen via observation  [ o : corner ] that at most seven crossing tiles can be placed on a @xmath63 board without reduction via a reidemeister type i move . moreover , since all seven crossing knots are alternating , there is only one way to place seven alternating crossing tiles up to mirror , reflection , and rotation as depicted in figure  [ f : alt_7 ] . when this arrangement is suitably connected , the only knot resulting is @xmath47 .",
    "therefore @xmath62 and all other seven - crossing knots have mosaic number six as depicted in the appendix .",
    "next we consider the eight - crossing knots .",
    "let @xmath3 be a knot of eight crossings . by the proof of theorem  [ t:6 - 3 ] , we know that @xmath3 can not fit on a @xmath20 mosaic board .",
    "this means @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore there exists a knot mosaic of @xmath3 on a @xmath25 board ( see the appendix ) .",
