    "blue compact dwarf starbursts belong to the group of galaxies which exhibit the starburst phenomenon , of intense star formation lasting for relatively short periods of time ( @xmath8 yr ) , while having absolute blue magnitudes of @xmath9 .",
    "they are generally low metallicity objects with @xmath10 ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( thuan 1983 ; loose & thuan 1986 ) , which could be the result of metal - loss associated with the bursting nature of their star - formation",
    ". intense periods of star - formation are an important phase of galactic evolution and can have a profound effect on the galaxies in which they occur so the study of local dwarf starbursts can give insight into the fate of similar objects that occurred at high redshifts ( e.g. the numerous faint blue compact objects seen on the hubble deep field images , mobashar et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the study of dwarfs is also important as they are the basic building blocks in the hierarchical merging cosmological scenario and as such are likely to have harboured the earliest occurrences of star - formation in the universe .",
    "the onset of a starburst leads to the formation of ob associations or even super star - clusters ( sscs ) containing many massive stars that have strong supersonic stellar winds injecting both energy and mass into the interstellar medium(ism ) .",
    "after a period of about 3.5 myr they begin to give rise to core - collapse supernovae which add to both the energy and mass loss from the starburst .",
    "the effect of these winds and supernovae is to sweep - up the ism and produce shock - heating of both ism and wind material leading to the production of an expanding superbubble of hot gas contained within a shell of cool ism material .",
    "the formation of such a structure will be accompanied by extended x - ray emission from the hot gas ( @xmath13  k ) and optical h@xmath1 line - emission from the cooler ( @xmath14  k ) shell .",
    "the continued expansion of the superbubble into the halo of the galaxy is due to it having a greater internal pressure than the surrounding ism .",
    "the onset of rayleigh - taylor instabilities is likely to lead to the rupture and subsequent escape of the hot gas in the form of a galactic wind , as seen most spectacularly in m82 ( strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 ) and ngc  253 ( strickland et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "typical signatures of such an event are spurs of x - ray emission coincident with the h@xmath15 emission ( heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) and horse - shoe shaped h@xmath15 emission with the open end furthest from the centre of any starburst regions ( marlowe et al .",
    "the optical and x - ray phenomena described here have been observed in several dwarf starburst galaxies .",
    "for example , he  2 - 10 ( mndez et al . 1999 ) , ngc  1569 ( heckman et al . , 1995 ) and ngc  5253 ( strickland & stevens , 1999 ) .",
    "such scenarios can have a catastrophic effect on their host galaxies if it results in the loss of a significant fraction of their mass , leading to expansion of the galaxy , a drop in its surface brightness and , potentially , a cessation of star - formation .",
    "the rupturing of superbubbles , allowing the venting of hot metal - enriched gas will effect the galaxy s chemical composition and evolution .",
    "such blow - outs could explain the low - metallicities observed in dwarf galaxies and because of their large numbers , the mass and energy lost from them during such processes will have had a profound impact on the state of the intergalactic medium ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "we present here new observations of mrk  33 ( haro  2 , ugc  5720 , arp  233 , iras  10293 + 5439 ) . this blue compact dwarf galaxy ( bcdg ) with a mass @xmath16 ( loose & thuan 1986 ) lies at a distance of 22 mpc ( conti 1991 ) assuming @xmath17  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 . at this distance , @xmath18 is equivalent to a distance of 0.11  kpc .",
    "mrk  33 does not appear to have any obvious companions however there is a very red galaxian object ( @xmath19 from the usno a2.0 catalogue , monet , 1998 ) lying at a projected distance of @xmath20  kpc ( @xmath21 ) and at a position angle of @xmath22 with respect to mrk  33 s position of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( j2000 ) .",

    "( 1992 ) , detected a radio source with no obvious optical counterpart @xmath26  kpc ( @xmath27 ) north of mrk  33 .",
    "as there is no kinematic data available for either of these objects , it is impossible to say whether they have any association with mrk  33 .",
    "described by huchra ( 1977 ) as being , ` patchy with wisps and a high surface brightness ' , mrk  33 was later given an ne classification by loose & thuan ( 1985 ; 1986 ) .",
    "due to its apparently straight - forward morphology , mrk  33 is the prototype of this class of object and as such gives an interesting and important snapshot of this intriguing phase of galaxy evolution .",
    "the galaxy s blue colour is emphasised by its b magnitude ( @xmath28 , de vaucouleurs et al . , 1991 ) and its @xmath29 colour of 0.36 ( thuan & martin 1981 ) , which is bluer than other starburst galaxies ( e.g. ngc  5253 @xmath30 ; ngc  1569 @xmath31",

    "optical and uv observations of mrk  33 along with spectral synthesis techniques show that the galaxy has experienced at least two other episodes of intense star - formation prior to the current one , ( loose & thuan 1986 ; fanelli et al .",
    "the most prominent emission feature in the optical spectrum is that of the h@xmath1+n[ii ] blend and legrand et al.s ( 1997 ) study of this emission line found evidence of a partially ionised wind out - flowing from the star - forming region at @xmath38  km  s@xmath5 .",

    "the quality of the x - ray spectral data was poor , and to obtain this fit , the metallicity was fixed at 0.1 solar , somewhat lower than the 0.3 solar quoted earlier .",
    "consequently , there are substantial uncertainties in the spectral fit and in particular on the value of @xmath46 . hence ,",
    "when the extreme values of @xmath46 were used , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity was only constrained to be in the range @xmath47  erg  s@xmath5 , although the uncertainty on the observed value will be much less than this range .    in section  2",
    ", we describe the new observations , firstly the x - ray observations with the _ rosat _ hri instrument and secondly @xmath48 and @xmath49 band optical imaging with the 1.0  m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) on la palma .",
    "the results obtained from these observations are detailed in section  3 while the implications of the optical results and the energetics of the starburst are discussed in section  4 with a view to determining the mass - loss rate from the starburst region , the energy injection rate into the ism and their possible implications on the subsequent evolution of mrk  33 .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised in section  5 .",
    "mrk  33 was observed with the _ rosat _ hri on april @xmath50 1997 for 47676s . by using two microchannel plates and a crossed grid position read out system",
    ", the hri produces images at its prime focus with a spatial resolution @xmath51 . the low number ( 16 ) of pulse height analyzer ( pha ) channels mean that its spectral analysis capabilities are limited ( david et al . , 1995 )",
    ", however it is possible to calculate hardness ratios for objects ( see later ) .",
    "the raw data set was obtained from the leicester data archive ( ledas ) and the data analysis was performed using the starlink asterix x - ray analysis package . after screening for bad data , no correction to the data needed to be made .",
    "two initial images were produced from the data , the first , for point source searching of the entire field , was @xmath52 square with the data binned in 5 arcsec square pixels , while the second , for detailed study of the region around mrk  33 , was of higher resolution , being @xmath53 square with the data binned in 1.5 arcsec square pixels . in both cases , only the photons received in pha channels 3 - 8 were used so as to reduce the contribution from background sources ( e.g. the detector s internal background , the x - ray background and charged particles ) .",
    "a constant background model was constructed for each of these images using a source free annulus with @xmath54 centred on the centre of the hri field of view , which lies @xmath55 sse of mrk  33 .",
    "the count rate obtained for each of these background models was @xmath56  ct  s@xmath5  arcmin@xmath57 .",

    "the second plot shows surface brightness against log ( @xmath84 ) where a straight line is indicative of a power law ( @xmath85 ) and the third shows surface brightness against @xmath86 . in the last case , a straight line is indicative of a de vacouleurs law of the form @xmath87}$ ] which is characteristic of spheroidal systems where , @xmath88 is the effective radius containing half the light emitted from the system and @xmath89 is the effective surface brightness at that radius . for the second and third plots in fig .",

    "the ellipticity does not show a smooth variation from the centre out but this is probably due to the starburst region affecting the shape of the isophotes in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the position angle steadily increases with radius suggesting an isophotal twist .",

    "recent h@xmath1 imaging of mrk  33 ( mndez et al . 2000 ) has shown the presence of at least three star - forming knots in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "these regions are distributed in a line from nw to se with the largest knot being in the centre and the two most northern peaks being closest together .",
    "these two northern star - forming regions are unresolved in our optical images and have been labelled n in fig .",

    "differences between our results and those of loose & thuan ( 1986 ) could have arisen due to the different methods used in ellipse fitting .",
    "our fitting had the ellipse centre fixed on the optical centre of the most northern peak of the two shown on our blue image ( fig .",
    "[ blue ] ) whilst their fitting had the ellipse centre @xmath123 and @xmath124 positions as free parameters .",
    "the increase in ellipticity seen for radii @xmath125 in our results has been influenced by the linear arrangement of the star - forming knots in the galaxy centre running from nw to se which will tend to elongate the ellipses.the isophotal twist observed means that our line - of - sight to mrk  33 is not along any of the galaxy s principle axes . if it were , the isophotes would be aligned like those of an axisymmetric system .",
    "it is possible that the twist is the result of the galaxy being triaxial but in no way conclusive .",
    "this could only be confirmed if the two true axial ratios could be determined .",
    "the @xmath98 colour profile shown in fig .",
    "[ ell ] shows as expected that the galaxy is very blue in the centre and becomes increasingly redder with radius .",
    "this reddening is indicative of a change in stellar populations with increasing distance from the centre and is expected from the population synthesis analysis of _ iue _ short - wavelength spectra performed by fanelli et al .",
    "this analysis showed distinct discontinuities in the stellar luminosity function of mrk  33 with no significant levels of o7b0v , b2b9v or supergiants found .",
    "the remaining stellar groups of o3o6v , b1-b1.5v and a0-a7v were detected in increasing numbers and this was interpreted as evidence for mrk  33 having experienced two episodes of intense star - formation prior to the current one . from the typical ages of the main sequence stars detected , the current burst of star - formation must be around 5  myr old , the previous one occurred around 20  myr ago and the earliest one around 500  myr ago .",
    "the fact that the number of stars detected in each group is decreasing with time is indicative of the fact that the amplitude of each successive starburst is also decreasing with time and may suggest that there is less material from which to form stars left after each intense star - forming episode . at a radius @xmath126 , which would just enclose the star - forming regions , @xmath127 , a colour that is typical of an f5v star , and by the time a radius of @xmath128 is reached , this has increased to and levelled out at @xmath129 , typical of a g0v star ( johnson 1966 ) .",
    "if these are the oldest stars present then mrk  33 only started forming stars @xmath130 yr ago .",
    "the extended x - ray emitting region in mrk  33 , appears to lie within the expanding h@xmath1 shell ( diameter @xmath131  kpc ) observed by legrand et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the centre of the galaxy , suggesting the presence of a superbubble .",
    "the model for such a starburst driven outflow ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ; weaver et al .",
    "1977 ) is outlined below .",
    "stars of type b2 and earlier have strong stellar winds associated with them , which will deposit @xmath132  ergs of mechanical energy into the ism , during each star s lifetime .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the energy in a supernova shell .",
    "as the winds from the ob association of the starburst move out into the interstellar medium , they will sweep up a thin , dense h@xmath1 emitting shell . just inside the shell",
    "will be a transition region that is dominated by thermal conduction between the cold shell and the hot ( @xmath133  k ) shocked stellar wind inside it .",
    "the ionizing of hydrogen is likely to be occurring in the shell itself and outside it there may be a layer of h@xmath134 . at first",
    ", the wind expands freely into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and shocks develop at its leading edge , a strong outward facing shock moving at a speed close to the terminal velocity of the wind and a weaker inward facing shock . as more material",
    "is swept up into the region between the two shocks , the momentum of the wind is insufficient to maintain the high speeds and so the shell slows down .",
    "this in turn leads to the strength of the inner shock increasing because of the increasing difference between the wind speed and the speed of the shocked material .",
    "this free expansion phase is very short and ends when the mass of swept up material becomes greater than the mass deposited in the region between the two shocks by the wind . at this time",
    "the gas between the shocks will be very hot with a temperature @xmath135  k produced by collisions in the shocks converting the mechanical energy of the wind to thermal energy .",
    "this thermalisation is particularly efficient because at these temperatures there is little cooling due to radiative losses .",
    "the superbubble then enters its adiabatic phase where it develops an onion - like structure and can be thought of as consisting of five layers ( strickland & stevens 1999 ) .",
    "layer 1 : - a freely expanding supersonic wind bounded by the inward facing shock .",
    "layer 2 : - the shocked wind material at @xmath136  k. layer 3 : - a contact discontinuity that forms a boundary between the shocked wind material and shocked ism material .",
    "layer 4 : - the hot swept - up shocked ism material that is bounded by the outward facing shock . layer 5 : - the ambient ism .",
    "adiabatic cooling occurs as work is being done increasing the bubble s volume and when the point is reached where layer 4 s temperature has dropped to @xmath137  k , the emission of line radiation becomes important and it s temperature rapidly falls to @xmath138  k. the two phases outlined above are very short , @xmath139 the lifetime of a starburst and so any observed superbubbles are much more likely to be in their third phase which is known as the ` snow - plough phase ' .",
    "layer 2 now occupies most of the bubbles volume and is at a uniform pressure since it is very hot and its sound crossing time is very much less than the age of the bubble .",
    "meanwhile , layer 4 which contains most of the bubble s mass is now a thin , dense , cool shell with its temperature maintained at @xmath138  k by the uv radiation from the massive stars of the starburst .",
    "the bubble continues to expand because its pressure is greater than that of the surrounding ism and its radius , @xmath140 , and expansion velocity @xmath141 , are given by :        where @xmath144 is the mechanical luminosity injected by the starburst in units of @xmath145  erg  s@xmath5 ( the mechanical luminosity injected by a typical b2 star ) , @xmath146 is the age of the starburst in units of @xmath147 yr and @xmath148 is the ambient number density of the ism .    thermal conduction at the contact discontinuity leads to the evaporation of material from layer 4 to layer 2 ( weaver et al . , 1977 ) , where the balancing of the conductive and mechanical energy fluxes lead to expressions for the temperature , @xmath149 and the gas density , @xmath150 , at the centre of layer 2 given by :            ( chu & mac low 1990 ) where @xmath154 is the volume emissivity of the gas over the temperature region being considered . adopting @xmath155  erg  @xmath156  s@xmath5 for the integral of the volume emissivity over the _ rosat _",

    "legrand et al.s ( 1997 ) measurement of the size and outflow velocity of the h@xmath1 shell give values of @xmath164  kpc ( scaled to a distance of 22  mpc ) and @xmath165  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the earlier work of lequeux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) studying mrk  33 s absorption lines of ly@xmath1 , oi , ni , siii , and siiii also found evidence for an outflow from the galaxy , which was interpreted as a galactic wind with a velocity of @xmath39  km  s@xmath5 . adopting this value for the expansion velocity of the superbubble and assuming an average radius of @xmath166  kpc ( see section 3.2.1 ) for the extended x - ray emitting source , a first estimate of the dynamical age , @xmath167 can be made by taking the ratio of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    ":      this dynamical age would have to be a lower limit for the starburst age and is most likely an underestimate of it since the non - thermal nature of the radio spectrum implies a substantial number of supernova remnants , suggesting that the starburst age should lie between about 4  myr and 40  myr . if , as is possibly indicated by the high expansion velocity , the superbubble has already ruptured then this low value for the dynamical age is a result of the hot gas and bubble shell being accelerated to higher velocities during blow out .",
    "once the bubble has expanded to a radius of the order of the galaxy scale height , its growth along the galaxy s minor axis will start to accelerate leading to the rupture of the superbubble and blow out .",
    "if the superbubble has a radius of 1.1  kpc then it has already grown to several scale heights , assuming the scale height is of the order of the half - light blue radius ( @xmath169  kpc ) , and it is likely that acceleration is underway and that blow out has just occurred .    substituting the value for the dynamical age back into equation ( 1 ) , while assuming an average number density for the ambient ism of @xmath170  @xmath171 ( following marlowe et al . ,",
    "1995 , who quote this as a typical value for this parameter in dwarf galaxies with recent or on - going star - formation ) and 90 per cent h to 10 per cent he , gives a maximum value for the mechanical energy injection rate of : @xmath172 , or @xmath173  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath144 figure would suggest that the maximum number of stars that could be present in the starburst would be @xmath174 , assuming they were all of type b2 and the minimum mass of the starburst would be @xmath175 .    comparing these values to the evolutionary synthesis models for an instantaneous starburst ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) with a normal salpeter imf with @xmath176 , an upper mass cut - off of @xmath177 , a lower mass cut - off of @xmath178 and allowing for the fact that a metallicity of @xmath179 is being assumed for mrk  33 , this energy injection rate is higher than would be expected for a @xmath180 starburst at @xmath181  myr and suggests the mass of the starburst is @xmath182 .",
    "a better quantity to consider instead of just the mechanical energy injection rate , @xmath160 , is the ratio of @xmath160 to @xmath183 , where @xmath183 is the bolometric luminosity of the starburst assumed to be @xmath184 ( it is better to use this ratio because it is a mass independent quantity ) . assuming @xmath185  erg  s@xmath5 , then @xmath186  erg  s@xmath5 at an age of @xmath181  myr and the mass of the starburst region @xmath187 .",
    "another estimate of the mass of the star - forming region of mrk  33 has been made by comparing the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxy to those predicted from sed modelling including single and binary systems ( cervino & mas - hesse 1999 ) .",
    "this gave an average value of @xmath188 , assuming an = age of 5  myr for the starburst .",
    "the justifications behind this choice are that mrk  33 is a wolf - rayet galaxy ( kunth & joubert 1985 ) suggesting an age of @xmath189  myr .",
    "coupled with this , the ly@xmath1 profile of mrk  33 ( lequeux et al .",
    "1995 ) is typical of that expected for a 5  myr old starburst from the evolution models of tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "a final mass estimate can be obtained from the number of o3o6  v stars in the starburst . from fanelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , the extinction - corrected observed flux requires @xmath190 o3o6  v stars ( when scaled for different assumed distances ) .",
    "assuming a salpeter imf with an upper mass limit of @xmath191 to accommodate the o3 stars , this gives a mass of @xmath192 . from the above considerations , a mass of @xmath193 is going to be assumed for the mass of the star - forming region of mrk  33 and all other quantities will be scaled accordingly .",
    "an upper limit on the age of the starburst is suggested by the @xmath98 colour of mrk  33 in its central region . the value of 0.56 shown in fig .",
    "[ ell ] would correspond to an age of @xmath194  myr from the evolutionary synthesis models but the actual value of @xmath195 in the central region is likely to be bluer than this due to the presence of large numbers of o and b stars and the fact that the surface brightness has not been determined using elliptical isophotes that just include the star - forming regions .    the flux in the h@xmath196 line found in mrk  33 s spectrum is predominantly produced by the massive ionizing stars found in the star - forming regions .",
    "the equivalent width of this line , which decreases with time as the number of hot stars decreases , is therefore a measure of the relative number of these stars in the galaxy and hence also an age indicator . for mrk  33 ,",
    "typical values of 21  ( kennicutt 1992 ) , 23  ( conti 1991 ) and 30  ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) have been quoted and these would correspond to ages of @xmath67 , @xmath197 and @xmath198  myr respectively , from evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "it is possible that these could be underestimates though as no allowance has been made for the presence of binary stars in the galaxy , which would tend to increase the age at which a particular equivalent width of h@xmath196 occurs at least for starbursts older than 4  myr ( van bever & vanbeveren 1998 ) .",
    "also , the total number of photons below the lyman limit can be used as an age estimator . for mrk  33",
    ", this quantity has a value of @xmath199  photons  s@xmath5 ( conti 1991 ) which would correspond to an age of @xmath200  myr .",
    "table  1 gives the estimates of @xmath160 calculated using equation ( 1 ) and also those determined from the @xmath160 to @xmath183 ratio for the six age estimates discussed above .",
    "the values obtained from the dynamical age differ by more than an order of magnitude and so both for this reason and the reasons given earlier , these results will not be included in the subsequent analysis .",
    ".estimates of the mechanical energy injection rate for mrk  33 for the six age estimates detailed in the text .",
    "column 2 gives the value calculated by using equation ( 1 ) and a value for the radius of the superbubble of 1.1  kpc .",
    "column 3 uses the @xmath201 ratios from the starburst evolutionary synthesis models ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ; leitherer et al .",
