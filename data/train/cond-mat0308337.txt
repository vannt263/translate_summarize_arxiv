    "in the linear nonequilibrium regime , statistical properties of fluctuations are known to characterize nonequlibrium states via exact identities such as the green - kubo formula and fluctuation - dissipation theorems . on the contrary ,",
    "general properties of the far - from - equilibrium fluctuations have not been well understood .",
    "recently , two new identities valid even far from equilibrium were found : the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) first found by evans , cohen and morriss@xcite and the nonequilibrium free - energy equality given by jarzynski@xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorem addresses the symmetry of entropy production or work externally done and several different versions are known .",
    "nevertheless , it takes the following general form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the probability of observing an average entropy production rate ( or an average power applied externally ) , @xmath3 , during the time interval @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 limit may or may not be taken depending on the situations .",
    "ft with @xmath5 limit was first found numerically by evans , cohen and morriss@xcite for nonequilibrium steady states of thermostatted systems .",
    "then , it was rigorously proved by gallavotti and cohen@xcite .",
    "this version is referred to as the steady - state fluctuation theorem ( ssft ) . on the other hand , before the proof by gallavotti and cohen , evans and searles@xcite derived the relation ( [ ft ] ) without @xmath5 limit for transient trajectories starting from initial states obeying the microcanonical distribution .",
    "this version is refered to as the transient fluctuation theorem ( tft ) and has been extensively studied by evans et al.@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was extended to stochastically driven systems@xcite and to open conservative systems@xcite .",
    "its relation with jarzynski equality was studied as well@xcite and the related topics have been extensively investigated ( see e.g. , references in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "recently , a beautiful experiment by wang et al.@xcite confirmed tft for a colloidal particle kept in a uniformly moving optical trap .",
    "the dynamics of the colloidal particle is governed by the langevin equation and tft holds for the work done externally .",
    "ft for the langevin equation was studied by mazonka and jarzynski@xcite to illustrate the difference between ssft and tft , and the experiment stimulates the reinvestigations of ft for the langevin equations@xcite .",
    "contrary to ft for classical systems , ft for quantum systems has not been well understood . in order to generalize ft to quantum systems , it is necessary to identify entropy change or work done externally . and",
    "two procedures are available :    * measure energy , particle numbers etc .",
    "twice and evaluate the entropy change or work done as the difference of the two observed values . * measure flows of energy , particle numbers etc . and",
    "evaluate the entropy change or work done as accumulated values of the flows .",
    "needless to say , in classical systems , the two procedures give the same values of the entropy change or work done , because of the conservation of energy and particle numbers .",
    "however , in quantum systems , as a result of the noncommutativity of dynamical variables , the two procedures are not equivalent .    as far as the authors know , the procedure ( a ) was first suggested by kurchan@xcite and he showed that the fluctuation theorem ( [ ft ] ) holds for the probability distribution function of the so - obtained entropy change or work done .",
    "similar results were discussed by hal tasaki@xcite , callens et al.@xcite , and the c@xmath6 generalization was given by tasaki and matsui@xcite .    on the other hand , the procedure ( b ) has not been well studied . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a quantum analogue of the fluctuation theorem , following the procedure ( b ) , with respect to the work done externally for a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled with a harmonic reservoir .",
    "the oscillator is externally driven in such a way that the center of the harmonic potential follows a given trajectory .",
    "note that the system is a quantum analogue of the langevin equation@xcite which describes the experiment by wang et al.@xcite .",
    "then , we have found that ( i )  there appears a quantum correction of order @xmath0 in tft , and that ( ii )  the existence of a quantum correction for ssft depends on the way of driving ( no correction in the uniformly dragged case and @xmath0-correction in the periodically driven case ) . moreover , the quantum correction for ssft is universal in the sense that it depends only on the temperature and the frequency of the driving , but not on the specific features of the system and environment .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the model is described in sec.[sec.model ] .",
    "the equation of motion is solved and quantum analogues to the fluctuation theorems are derived in sec.[sec.dis ] .",
    "the subsequent sections are devoted to the discussions of tft and ssft separately . in the last section , discussions are given .",
    "in order to discuss quantum corrections to the fluctuation theorem , we study an exactly solvable model of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator linearly coupled with a harmonic bath@xcite . because a straightforward derivation of a quantum langevin equation is known@xcite ,",
    "the gardiner s version is used .",
    "then , we consider the following thought experiment :    * the system is prepared to be in equilibrium with inverse temperature @xmath7 . * at time @xmath8 , the harmonic potential starts to move , where its center follows the trajectory @xmath9 .    when @xmath10 , the potential center is assumed to be fixed at @xmath11 and to move continuously ( namely , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the time evolution is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 stand for the coordinate , momentum and mass of the harmonic oscillator , respectively , @xmath17 is the strength of the harmonic potential , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the coordinate and momentum of a bath degree of freedom with frequency @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the normal product with respect to the normal modes : @xmath22 here we assume that @xmath20 runs from 0 to @xmath23 and that the dispersion equation @xmath24 has no real zeros , where @xmath25 this condition corresponds to the case of the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "as in the previous works@xcite , we investigate the statistical property of the work externally done during the time interval @xmath4 divided by temperature @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "if the work is started to be measured at time @xmath28 , it is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the time derivative of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the coordinate operator in the heisenberg picture at time @xmath33 .",
    "then , the probability density @xmath34 of the work is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the thermal average and @xmath37 is the partition function .",
    "note that tft refers to the symmetry of @xmath38 while ssft refers to that of @xmath39 .",
    "in this section , we derive an explicit expression of the distribution function @xmath40 of the work @xmath41 .",
    "first we note that the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath42 is diagonalized by the normal modes : @xmath43 where the normal mode @xmath44 and the interaction strength @xmath45 are given , respectively , by ( [ oldmode ] ) and ( [ intv ] ) , @xmath46 and the function @xmath47 is defined in ( [ diseq ] ) .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath48=\\delta(\\lambda-\\lambda ' ) $ ] and @xmath49 the old variables can be represented by these normal modes .",
    "for example , @xmath50 and , thus , @xmath51 where @xmath52 .    from ( [ newham ] ) , one finds that the normal mode @xmath53 in the heisenberg picture obeys @xmath54 which admits the solution : @xmath55 and we obtain the coordinate @xmath56 in the heisenberg picture as @xmath57 then , by a tedious but straightforward calculation , one obtains the work operator @xmath27 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a ` partial fourier transformation ' of @xmath60 : @xmath61      the distribution function @xmath34 of the work @xmath27 is obtained with the aid of the characteristic function @xmath62 with the aid of the formula @xmath63 ( its proof is given in appendix ) , one obtains the following expression : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 eq.([chft ] ) shows that the distribution @xmath40 is gaussian with the mean value @xmath67 and the standard deviation @xmath68 : @xmath69    by setting @xmath8 , ( [ gauss ] ) leads to the quantum counterpart of tft@xcite @xmath70    in addition , provided that the limits @xmath71 and @xmath72 exist , one has @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and the quantum counterpart of ssft is derived @xmath75    if the coefficient of @xmath76 in ( [ q - tft ] ) and that of @xmath77 in ( [ q - ssft ] ) were unity , the fluctuation theorems would hold .",
    "however , the expressions of the mean value @xmath67 and the standard deviation @xmath68 seem to indicate the deviations . in the following ,",
    "we investigate this question for tft and ssft separately . in the latter case ,",
    "since the existence of the @xmath78 limits strongly depends on the behavior of @xmath79 , we focus on two concrete examples : the uniformly dragged case @xmath80 and the periodically driven case @xmath81 .",
    "in this section , quantum corrections for tft ( transient fluctuation theorem ) will be investigated .",
    "first we note that @xmath82 can be rewritten as @xmath83 as the integrand is different from that of @xmath84 , one has @xmath85 and , thus , tft does not hold .    using the expansion @xmath86 ,",
    "the quantum correction can be easily calculated .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath87 and , thus , @xmath88 where @xmath89    to illustrate the behavior of @xmath90 , we consider the uniformly dragged case @xmath80 where the damping is very weak : @xmath91 . up to the first order in @xmath92 , the function @xmath93 can be approximated by @xmath94 where the symbol p in the integrand stands for cauchy s principal part .",
    "then , by a straightforward calculation , one finds that the leading term of the correction @xmath90 with respect to @xmath92 is independent of time @xmath4 and @xmath95",
    "in this section , quantum corrections for ssft ( steady - state fluctuation theorem ) will be investigated . in this case , the long - time limit @xmath78 should be taken .",
    "as the existence and the limiting value strongly depends on the potential motion @xmath79 , we examine quantum corrections for two examples : the uniformly dragged case @xmath80 and the periodically driven case @xmath81 .      in this case @xmath80 and the mean work @xmath67 and its variance @xmath96 read as @xmath97 and @xmath98    in the limit of @xmath78 , one finds @xmath99 where @xmath100 is used and @xmath101 note that @xmath102 as the variance does not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "these equations together with @xmath103 ( @xmath5 ) give @xmath104 therefore , ssft holds exactly : @xmath105 the reason can be understood easily .",
    "indeed , the motion of the potential is uniform in this case and only the zero frequency environmental modes do contribute to the steady - state work distribution .",
    "on the other hand , quantum effects appear only for the non - zero frequency modes and , thus , the quantum correction disappears in ssft . in the next section",
    ", we consider a case where non - zero environmental modes do contribute to ssft .      in this section , we consider the periodically driven case @xmath106 .",
    "first we remark that , in this case , there exists no exact steady state since the system is periodically driven .",
    "we consider , instead , a limiting oscillatory state obtained by a ` stroboscopic limit ' , where the time @xmath28 is set to @xmath107 and the limit @xmath108 is taken .",
    "the variable @xmath109 represents the phase of the limiting oscillation .",
    "hereafter , we abbreviate @xmath110    the variance of the work for @xmath111 now reads as @xmath112 since it does not depend on @xmath16 , one has @xmath113 . then , by a tedious but straightforward calculation , one obtains @xmath114    as in the same way , one has @xmath115 \\label{meanpo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath116    eqs.([stdevlimpo ] ) and ( [ meanlimpo ] ) give @xmath117 and , thus , ssft does not hold @xmath118 where the distribution function refers to the limiting oscillatory state .",
    "note that the quantum correction is universal in the sense that it depend only on the temperature and the frequency of the driving , but not on the specific features of the system and environment .",
    "in summary , for a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled with a harmonic reservoir , we have investigated quantum analogues of the transient and steady - state fluctuation theorems with respect to the work done externally . and we have shown the followings :    * in the transient fluctuation theorem , there appears a quantum correction of order @xmath0 .",
    "* in the steady - state fluctuation theorem , the existence of a quantum correction depends on the way of driving . in the uniformly dragged case , the classical formula holds , while , in the periodically driven case , there appears a correction of order @xmath0 .",
    "we remind that the steady - state fluctuation theorem for the periodically driven case refers to the limiting oscillatory state , which is obtained as the stroboscopic limit defined in ( [ stroblim ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the situation is in contrast to that for kurchan s quantum fluctuation theorem , where energy is measured twice , and the entropy change and work done are evaluated from the difference between the two measured values . in this case , as discussed previously@xcite , the ( transient ) fluctuation theorem holds as in the classical systems .",
    "finally , we note that the quantum correction for the steady - state fluctuation theorem is universal in the sense that it depends only on the temperature and the frequency of the driving , but not on the specific features of the system and environment .",
    "we expect that this is also the case for general systems .",
    "the authors are grateful to professors t. matsui and m. sano for fruitful discussions and valuable comments .",

    "the desired result immediately follows from @xmath120 where @xmath121=1 $ ] and @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "this relation can be shown as follows .",
    "the baker - hausdorff theorem gives @xmath124 with the aid of the coherent states @xmath125 , which satisfy @xmath126 one finds @xmath127 which leads to the desired relation ( [ 1deg ] ) : @xmath128",
    "to proceed the calculations in sec.[sec.dis ] , one has to evaluate integrals involving @xmath129 . in this appendix",
    ", we illustrate the way by evaluating @xmath130 the key idea is to rewrite it as a contour integral and to use the relations : @xmath131 then , one has @xmath132 where the integration contour @xmath133 is shown in fig.b.1 ."
