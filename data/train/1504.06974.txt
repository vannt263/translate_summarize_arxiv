    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe and have been useful cosmological probes to learn about the geometry and structure of the universe .",
    "x - ray observations have , to date , provided the most efficient way to collect samples of clusters .",
    "cluster catalogs compiled from the rosat all - sky survey @xcite have often been used in combination with follow - up observations by xmm / chandra to give rigorous cosmological constraints . based on a sample of 238 clusters with redshifts ranging from 0 to 0.5 , @xcite present constraints on the density parameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) from cluster abundance and on the dark energy parameters ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) from the redshift evolution of that abundance .",
    "the mass fraction of host gas , @xmath11 , measured at large radii in the most massive halos is also used to as a cosmological probe , as it provides a direct measure of the luminosity distance under the assumption of the universality of the gas fraction in massive halos ; it is expected to scale as @xmath12 , and is sensitive enough to give a level of constraint on the parameters comparable to those from other methods @xcite .",
    "so far , no significant departure from @xmath5cdm model is reported .",
    "the erosita satellite is scheduled to launch in 2016 and is expected to collect yet more clusters in a more distant redshift range , and is expected to obtain more stringent constraints @xcite .    in the mean time , the clusters themselves draw astronomers interests as a site of galaxy formation and galaxy - galaxy interactions . galaxy formation is a process which is accompanied by the conversion of baryons into stars in a dark matter halo ; the star formation efficiency is critically dependent on the ability of the gas to cool . in a less massive dark",
    "matter halo , the gas is easily reheated and swept out from the center by feedback processes such as supernova explosions . in a massive halo , the cooling time becomes longer as the halo mass becomes larger and the virial gas temperature higher , and galaxy formation is expected to be suppressed .",
    "it is also argued that agn could provide an efficient star - formation suppression feedback mechanism in the higher mass range .",
    "these considerations indicate that there is an optimal halo mass where star formation is most effective around @xmath13 and where the stellar mass to halo mass ratio should peak .",
    "statistical estimate based on the abundance matching technique generally agree with these naive expectations .",
    "@xcite .    in terms of individual halos",
    ", we now have accumulating observational evidences that the star formation efficiency actually drops as the host dark matter halo mass increases in the group to cluster scale , @xmath14 , @xcite .",
    "these observational efforts are also motivated by the desire to measure the _ total _ baryon mass ( gas and stars ) to dark matter ratio and to compare with the universal baryon to dark matter density ratio measured from the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this is , of course , related to the interesting  missing baryon problem  @xcite , and quantitative measurements are important .",
    "however , the discrepancy among the observations are quite large so far . on the one hand , using 12 galaxy clusters at redshifts around 0.1 with @xmath15 ,",
    "@xcite argue that the difference between the universal value and cluster baryon fractions is less than the systematic uncertainties associated with the mass determinations . on the other hand , @xcite insists clear shortfall based on the observation of x - ray groups with @xmath16 , in cosmos field .    this confusion may arise partly from the variety of halo mass measurement techniques .",
    "@xcite estimate the halo mass from the x - ray temperature using the usual virial scaling relation in which they assume the x - ray gas is in hydrodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the dynamical method adopted in @xcite assumes that the system is virialized , which many not be true in the outer region of the clusters .",
    "@xcite estimates the mass primarily from x - ray luminosity although this is calibrated by weak lensing .",
    "the chosen methods work best in different mass ranges , and their systematics almost certainly exist and are almost certainly different from technique to technique .",
    "@xcite reported that the gas fraction is anti - correlated with stellar mass fraction in their simulation .",
    "this could shift the ratio of the stellar mass over the halo mass which introduces another complexity in the studies based on the optically or x - ray selected clusters .    in this paper",
    ", we employ new approach to sample clusters and measure the halo mass directly by weak lensing with the fewest assumptions about the dynamical state of the cluster . as a part of the commissioning run on the subaru telescope of the newly developed hyper suprime - cam @xcite camera",
    ", we observed a 2.3 deg@xmath0 field in i - band .",
    "we use these observations to locate massive dark matter halos directly via weak lensing by means of the derived convergence map .",
    "a deep multi - color catalog is used to generate an optically selected cluster catalog with estimated redshifts using the novel camira algorithm @xcite .",
    "this optical catalog is then correlated with the list of peaks in the convergence map .",
    "these peaks , if _ not _ coincident with optically selected clusters , can be spurious , generated by noise , can correspond to chance coincidences of less massive halos along the line of sight , or can corresponds to real clusters with very high mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we chose the deep lens survey ( dls ) field @xcite for this investigation , for which a deep multi - color galaxy catalog is publicly available , to generate the optical cluster catalog .",
    "based on the shear selected cluster catalogs combined with the luminosity based catalog , we determine the cluster number count and the redshift distribution over a wide contiguous area over which observational systematic errors can be expected to be minimized , since the data are taken almost simultaneously over the whole field with an instrument with a wide field and relatively uniform point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we then determine the stellar mass fraction of individual shear selected clusters .",
    "the individual halo mass , estimated directly through lensing , ranges nicely between the samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "not all the observing facilities allow this approach . in order to locate the individual dark matter halos ,",
    "a high resolution surface mass density map is necessary , which requires a sufficient number density of faint background galaxies whose shapes are measured with the necessary accuracy . with a much wider field of view ( roughly ten times the area )",
    "than the original suprime - cam @xcite , the 1.5 degree hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) field on the 8.2 m subaru telescope has a crucial advantage for a weak lensing survey .",
    "we have an approved plan to carry out a three layer legacy survey using hyper suprime - cam @xcite . based on the pilot observations presented here , we attempt to demonstrate the prospects of the power of the legacy survey .",
    "dls field 2 was observed on february 4th , 2013 hawaii time . as is shown in table[exposureinfo ] ,",
    "two pointing centers are chosen whose angular distance is 0.75 degree apart .",
    "because the field of view of hsc is 1.5 degree , we have substantial overlap between two pointings .",
    "the exposure time is either 300 sec ( 9 exposures on south , 8 exposures on north ) or 150 sec ( 4 exposures on north ) , and the total exposure time of south and north pointing is 2700 sec and 3000 sec , respectively . a circular dithering pattern of radius 2 arcmin is adopted around each pointing center to fill the gap of ccds . the position angle is increased by 72@xmath1790 degree between exposures .    .exposure information [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .  [ fig : richnessmass.nz ] ( a ) shows the relation between the richness and cluster virial mass , @xmath18 of the optically selected cluster samples that have counterparts with the convergence peaks .",
    "the correlation is clearly seen and the slope is roughly 1@xmath17 1.5 , which agrees nicely with the slope found in @xcite where the richness - mass relation was derived from stacked weak lensing analysis with the cfhtlens shear catalogue .",
    "this further supports the reality of the cross - match of our lensing peaks and the optically selected clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : richnessmass.nz ] ( b ) , we show the redshift distribution of the identified shear selected clusters on table[tab : shear_selected_cluster ] .",
    "we see two spikes around z of 0.3 and 0.5 which clearly indicates that this narrow 2.3 deg@xmath0 field is populated by large scale structure at these redshifts ; this has been mentioned already by @xcite .",
    "we need a significantly wider field of view to overcome the local variance and to make cosmological arguments from the redshift distribution of clusters .      the observed area which overlaps with dls amounts to 2.3 deg@xmath0 , in which we found eight significant peaks whose s / n exceeds 4.5 .",
    "even if we drop peak i d 6 from the list , which may be substructure within the a781 main cluster , seven peaks still remain . @xcite estimated the cosmological variance in cluster samples and suggested that the variance exceeds the shot noise when the mass of clusters becomes less than @xmath19 with a weak dependence of the threshold mass on the survey volume .",
    "this is exactly the mass range that we are working on .",
    "therefore , statistical arguments require comparison with cosmological simulations as we will see below .    @xcite calculated the number of peaks on the weak lensing convergence map using a large set of gravitational lensing ray - tracing simulations which are detailed in @xcite .",
    "following the work , we made 1000 realizations to evaluate the sample variance . in making the mock weak lensing convergence map",
    ", we added a random galaxy shape noise to the lensing shear data .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of the random galaxy shape noise was set so that the observed galaxy number density and rms of galaxy ellipticities are recovered .",
    "we adopted a fixed source redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite estimated the redshift distribution of magnitude limited samples taken from vimos vlt deep survey , and reported the mean redshift of @xmath21 for a sample of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a sample of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it would be appropriate to set @xmath25 for our galaxy sample of @xmath26 .",
    "the expected peak count of s / n > 4.5 is 0.61 on 2.3 deg@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hamana12 ] , we show the probability distribution of the number of peaks under a given s / n threshold on a 2.3 deg@xmath0 wide field .",
    "as is shown in square symbols , the maximum number of peaks reached in the realization is 4 ( 9/1000 ) when the s / n = 4.5 .",
    "this means that we have practically no chance to have seven or eight significant peaks on 2.3 deg@xmath0 field .",
    "is this a challenge against the current cdm based cosmology ?",
    "we note that the sensitivity of the number of peak to the s / n value is quite high , reflecting the steepness of mass function at the high mass end .",
    "so we experimentally lower the s / n down to 4 and examine the statistics .",
    "the mean number of peaks is 1.6 and the maximum number of peaks is eight in two realizations out of 1000 ( 0.2% , see triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : hamana12 ] ) .",
    "this still does not reconcile the gap between the observation and the prediction .    in the mean time",
    ", @xcite had adopted cosmological simulation which used 3rd year wmap result @xcite .",
    "wmap3 is known to have yielded a relatively low @xmath6 of 0.76 .",
    "if we adopt the recent planck result @xcite , @xmath27 , the expected cluster count becomes a factor of 5.26 higher than wmap3 .",
    "this relaxes the tension dramatically and now what we observed is not extremely unlikely ; the chance to obtain more than 8 peaks of s / n > 4.5 is 3.7 % .",
    "one thing that we could suggest here is that our peak count strongly favours the recent planck result .",
    "we now examine the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass , @xmath28 , of our samples . in the mass range that we probe ,",
    "@xmath29 is reported to decrease as the halo mass increases , suggesting that star formation is less efficient in larger halos .",
    "this can be mostly explained by the inefficiency of the cooling process inside larger halos .",
    "@xcite presented one of the most recent results based on new halo mass estimates from xmm - newton x - ray data .",
    "they claimed that the stellar baryon mass well compensates the shortage in the baryon budget and that the sum of the stellar baryon and the baryons in the form of gas almost reaches to the universal value estimated by wmap and planck .",
    "they also made a comparison of different observational results @xcite .",
    "they found that the stellar mass fractions reported in other works are generally lower than @xcite .",
    "however , they claimed that if the mass in the intra - cluster light ( icl ) is considered , the discrepancy among the observations is minimized .",
    "[ fig : fsmdm ] shows the @xmath29 versus the halo mass of our samples ( circles ) .",
    "the mass is estimated by weak lensing as explained previously and the mass range of the samples is wider than that of previous small samples .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath30 shown in table 2 is the total stellar mass integrated by convolving spatial filter as shown in fig",
    ". 2 of oguri ( 2014 ) . in order to estimate the stellar mass fraction accurately , we convert this stellar mass to the stellar mass within @xmath31 as follows .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass density profile follows an nfw profile with the concentration parameter as a function of halo mass of duffy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for each halo with the mass @xmath32",
    ", we derive a conversion factor from @xmath30 in table 2 to the stellar mass within @xmath31 by convolving the projected nfw profile with the spatial filter of oguri ( 2014 ) and estimating the ratio of the total mass with the spatial filter to @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the conversion factor is @xmath33 for massive halos with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for less massive halos with @xmath36 .",
    "we note that this correction also takes account of the 3d de - projection , i.e. , properly removes member galaxies outside @xmath31 projected along the line - of - sight .",
    "thus our result should be compared with the so - called ` 3d ' stellar mass result in @xcite that incorporates the de - projection .",
    "the error in @xmath37 estimate is roughly 30 % .",
    "we also expect a large scatter of @xmath38% in @xmath30 for a given halo mass largely originating from the poisson noise in the numbers of cluster member and background galaxies .",
    "therefore , we expect as large as 40 % level error in estimate of the individual @xmath29 .",
    "the typical error bar is presented on the leftmost data point in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsmdm ] .    compared with @xcite results ( triangles and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsmdm ] ) , @xmath29 of this work is lower on average over our mass range .",
    "we did not attempt to include the contribution from the icl but according to @xcite , the icl contribution is @xmath17 25 % ( dotted line in the figure ) which can not totally explain the discrepancy . our result agrees better with lower @xmath29 results estimated by halo occupation distribution ( hod ) method in @xcite and favors the argument that missing baryon problem has not yet been resolved in this mass range . we further note that @xcite assumed a stellar mass to luminosity ratio that is on average slightly lower than the salpeter initial mass function adopted in this paper",
    ". our stellar mass estimates are therefore larger than their estimates by @xmath39 which makes the discrepancy of the results larger by this factor .",
    "the decrease rate of @xmath29 with increasing halo mass is an interesting observable because it reflects how the clusters are formed .",
    "theoretical predictions and the recent n - body simulations coupled with semi - analytic models disfavor the steep slope in the framework of @xmath5cdm cosmological model .",
    "this is because the hierarchical clustering predicts that low mass halos with a certain @xmath29 would be assembled together and become a larger halo with a comparable @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the log - log slope of @xmath17 0.3 would be the upper limit to be consistent with their simulations in the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "the slopes that have been observed and were compiled in @xcite span over 0.3@xmath170.6 and the slope of 0.45 is presented by the author s data which is slightly steeper than the theoretical preference . in our case , the slope is slightly shallower than the data of @xcite ; 0.32 when we exclude a781 main ( long - dash - line ) and very shallow 0.05 ( short - dash - line ) when we consider all the clusters .",
    "it is , however , difficult to make really qualitative arguments here due to the large error for the limited number of clusters in this work .",
    "more data are certainly cried for and the on - going hsc legacy survey will provide ideal sources for the future studies .",
    "we show the results of a weak - lensing cluster search on 2.3 square degrees of hsc commissioning data in the abell 781 field with 1.6 hours of exposure .",
    "the data are excellent , with very good image quality ; some slight astigmatism was found which was traced to a small miscollimation ( since corrected ) but was not difficult to correct because of the low order spatial variation .",
    "clusters were searched for on a high resolution convergence map generated froma these data .",
    "we see very good agreement with the previous results in mass measurements in this field made by wittman et al ( 2014 ) except for one peak , corresponding to abell 781 west .",
    "clusters of galaxies were searched for in optical data using camira algorithm @xcite .",
    "this cluster list was compared with the locations of the peaks in the convergence map .",
    "there is only one significant peak which we can not judge the reality because it is outside of dls field where no multi - color data is available .",
    "all the other peaks of s / n > 4.5 are physically real .",
    "this demonstrates the reliability of the convergence map generated from these even early hsc data .",
    "the number of observed clusters at this level is significantly larger than the predicted average number in this field size expected from theoretical calculations based on wmap-3 results .",
    "this result , however , is extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath6 in the theoretical predictions , and is not unlikely if we adopt the recent planck cosmology with its somewhat higher value of @xmath27 .",
    "the stellar mass fraction in our sample is systematically lower than one of the other most recent results and is more consistent with the earlier values estimated by use of the hod statistical formalism .",
    "our result thus favors the argument that baryons are still missing in this mass range .",
    "the decrease of the stellar mass fraction with increasing halo mass is slightly shallower than the previous work , and is more consistent with current ( though still very uncertain ) simulations .",
    "so even though the results for number density and stellar mass fraction from this very small sample are not conclusive , samples not enormously larger than this with this instrumentation will be sufficient to provide excellent results on these important quantities , and a large survey is underway which will provide these data .    in this work , we were at least able to demonstrate that cluster identification , redshift estimates , and mass estimates can be obtained by multi - band optical imaging data with the newly developed hyper suprime - cam camera through weak lensing and cluster finding techniques .",
    "hsc has uniquely combined features of wide field , large aperture and superb image quality and the data from the currently on - going hsc legacy survey is very promising for these and many other cosmological investigations .",
