    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies are considered to be a special class of  normal \" seyfert 1 galaxies because of their peculiar properties that distinguish them from the latter class .",
    "they are characterized by their optical spectra having permitted lines that are narrower than those in the normal seyfert 1 galaxies , e.g. , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of h@xmath11 line is @xmath16 , relatively weak forbidden lines , @xmath17\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}<3 $ ] ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1989 ) , and strong fe  ii emission .",
    "x - ray observations with @xmath18 ( e.g. , puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ) and @xmath1 ( e.g. , boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ) have revealed that nls1 galaxies have distinctive soft x - ray properties as well .",
    "nls1 galaxies show steep soft x - ray spectra with little or no absorption above the galactic values along their respective lines of sight ( grupe et al .",
    "they often show rapid and large amplitude as well as long - term x - ray variability ( boller et al .  1993 , brandt , pounds , & fink 1995 , grupe et al .",
    "1995a , b ) . in spite of the dominance of soft x - ray emission , the soft x - ray luminosities of nls1 galaxies are similar to those of normal seyfert 1s .",
    "high luminosity analogs of the nls1 class , however , do exist .",
    "proto - types of this class being  a narrow - line qso ( or nlqso ) i  zw  1 ( phillips 1976 ) , phl  1092 ( brandt 1995 ; forster & halpern 1996 ; lawrence et al .",
    "1997 ) , pks  0558 - 504 ( remillard et al .  1991 ) , and pg  1404 + 226 ( ulrich et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from far - infrared ( fir ) to x - rays of nls1 galaxies appears to be similar to that of broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies , but the uv luminosities of nls1 galaxies tend to be smaller than those of seyfert 1s ( rodriguez - pascual , mas - hesse , & santos - lle 1997 ) .",
    "the lower uv luminosity of nls1 galaxies compared to normal seyfert 1s could be due the shift of the big blue bump ( bbb ) towards higher energies",
    ". the steep soft x - ray spectrum could be the high energy tail of the bbb ( mathur 2000 ) .",
    "to explain the relatively narrow width ( fwhm@xmath19 ) of the h@xmath11 line in the nls1 galaxies as compared to those ( fwhm@xmath20 ) in the seyfert  1 galaxies , wandel ( 1997 ) has argued that the steeper soft x - ray continuum has a higher ionizing power , resulting in an extended broad line region ( blr ) , and hence a smaller velocity dispersion and narrower emission lines .",
    "alternative views involve the virialized motion of similar size blr around a smaller black hole mass in nls1s compared to those in seyfert  1s ( see laor et al .",
    "1997a ; brandt & boller 1998 ) , and disc inclination effects ( e. g osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1985 ) .",
    "the weakness of the forbidden line , [ o  iii]@xmath13 , relative to h@xmath11 has not been understood .",
    "the importance of the decomposition of the balmer lines , h@xmath12 and h@xmath11 , into narrow and broad components has been realized only recently in order to study the narrow line region ( nlr ) and blr emission line ratios in the nls1 galaxies .",
    "recent work of rodriguez - ardilla et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has revealed that emission line ratios from the narrow line region ( nlr ) of nls1 are different from those observed in seyfert galaxies , e.g. @xmath17\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}=0.8 - 5.0 $ ] in the nlr of 7 nls1 galaxies , which is significantly different from the value @xmath21 observed in the nlr of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the reason for the observed difference has not been understood satisfactorily . also , there are only a few nls1 galaxies for which the nlr emission line ratios have been determined .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the nlr and blr emission line ratios in the other nls1 galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we present soft x - ray and optical emission line properties of a new narrow - line qso ( nlqso ) ",
    "rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , and investigate the origin of the nlr and blr emission line ratios .",
    "the object , rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , was identified as an ultra - soft x - ray source by singh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based on wgacat ( white , giommi , & angelini 1994 ) . using deep @xmath1 pspc observations ,",
    "the optical counterpart of the x - ray source rx  j1334.2 + 3759 was identified by mchardy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . the basic parameters of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 are given in table 1 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the x - ray and the optical spectroscopic observations followed by analyses of the x - ray data and the optical spectrum in @xmath22 .",

    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     due to the poor instrumental resolution ( fwhm @xmath25 ) , it was not possible to decompose h@xmath12 and [ n  ii]@xmath26 lines .",
    "to measure reliably the fwhm and the equivalent width of h@xmath12 , it is necessary to correct for the contribution of [ n  ii]@xmath26 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have created templates for the [ n  ii]@xmath26 lines from the [ o  iii]@xmath13 line .",
    "these lines are expected to have similar widths and are unresolved in the spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 .",
    "first , we isolated the [ o  iii]@xmath13 line in the wavelength region @xmath27@xmath28 from the continuum subtracted and the fe  ii corrected spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 .",

    "we did not change the fwhm of [ n  ii]@xmath29 template from that of [ o  iii]@xmath13 . to make the template for the [",
    "n  ii]@xmath32 line , the [ n  ii]@xmath29 template was shifted to the rest wavelength of [ n  ii]@xmath32 and then scaled so that the ratio of fluxes of [ n  ii]@xmath29 and [ n  ii]@xmath32 is the same as the theoretical ratio of @xmath33 . to correct for the contribution of [ n  ii]@xmath26 to the h@xmath12 line",
    ", the two templates , created above , were subtracted from the continuum subtracted and fe  ii corrected spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 .",
    "this subtraction has little effect on the h@xmath12 profile because the intensities of [ n  ii]@xmath26 lines are much smaller than that of h@xmath12 .",
    "this is expected since the flux ratio , @xmath34\\lambda5007}{h\\beta}$ ] is very small ( @xmath35 ) for rx  j1334.2 + 3759 which gives the flux ratio , @xmath36\\lambda\\lambda6548,6583}{h\\alpha } \\approx0.016 $ ] assuming the case b value of the flux ratio @xmath37 ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the h@xmath12 profile is again poorly fitted by a single gaussian . applying the same decomposition technique , as was done for the h@xmath11 profile , we find that the profile of h@xmath12 is best fitted by two gaussians , one with a narrow component ( fwhm @xmath38 ) and another with a broad component ( fwhm @xmath39 ) .",
    "the two component profile fit to the h@xmath12 is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the equivalent widths , listed in table 4 , refer to the flux density at the rest wavelength of h@xmath12 in the fe  ii corrected spectrum",

    "rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is luminous in optical and soft x - rays . its optical luminosity ( @xmath40 assuming @xmath41 ) and soft x - ray luminosity ( @xmath42 in the energy band of @xmath10 ) are similar to that of a low luminosity qso . the object has been classified as a qso by mchardy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . based on optical spectroscopy and analysis of publically available x - ray data from @xmath1 observations , we find that the newly discovered qso rx  j1334.2 + 3759 belongs to the nls1 class .",
    "therefore , it is referred to as nlqso here .",
    "its x - ray and optical characteristics are further discussed below .      soft x - ray emission from rx  j1334.9 + 3759 is highly variable ( see fig . 2 & 3 ) . during the 1991 observations ,",
    "rx  j1334.9 + 3759 showed soft x - ray variability on times scales of @xmath2 by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "rapid variability events have also been detected from rx  j1334.9 + 3759 .",
    "the most significant and extreme variable event , shown in fig .",
    "3 , has @xmath43 , which is similar to that of the extreme variable event observed from phl  1098 ( brandt et al .",
    "straightforward application of the efficiency ( @xmath44 ) limit : @xmath45 ( fabian 1979 ) , results in an extremely high efficiency ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath47 for an optimally accreting kerr bh rotating at the maximum plausible rate ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "thus the radiative efficiency for the extreme variable event shown in fig .",
    "3 appears to be substantially larger and suggests relativistic effects responsible for the extreme variable event .",
    "the suggestion that relativistic effects may be responsible for the extreme variability event can also be inferred as follows .",
    "the variability time scale , in the absence of relativistic effects , provides an upper limit to the size of the x - ray emitting region , @xmath48 . for rx",
    "j1334.2 + 3759 , @xmath49 .",
    "seds of a sample of nls1 galaxies ( rodriguez - pascual , mas - hesse , & santos - lle 1997 ) show that the soft x - ray luminosity of nls1s can , at most , be @xmath50 of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "if we assume that the sed of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is similar to that of the other nls1s , then the bolometric luminosity of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is expected to be @xmath51 .",
    "if this luminosity is within the eddington limit , then rx  j1334.2 + 3759 must have a central mass , @xmath52 . in that case , the radius of the last stable orbit , @xmath53 , would then be larger than the size of the x - ray emitting region , so photons should not escape .    extremely rapid x - ray variability has also been observed in three other nls1-class objects : pks  0558 - 504 ( @xmath54 ; remillard et al .",
    "1991 ) , iras  13224 - 3809 ( @xmath55 ; boller et al .",
    "1997 ) , and phl  1092 ( @xmath56 ; brandt et al .  1999 ) and relativistic effects have been suggested to be responsible for the enhanced x - ray variability .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is very steep and is well represented by a power - law of photon index , @xmath57 with an excess absorption , @xmath58 , local to the source and apart from the galactic absorption , @xmath59 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "thus the soft x - ray spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is steeper than those of normal seyfert 1s [ @xmath60 ( @xmath61 range)@xmath62 , and similar to those of nls1 galaxies [ @xmath63 ( grupe et al .",
    "the intrinsic absorption , inferred from the power - law model fit to the spectra of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is not high , and is similar to those found in normal seyfert 1s and nls1 galaxies .",
    "the steeper power - law index and blackbody model fit to the pspc spectra of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 indicate the ultra - soft nature of this object .",
    "the derived temperature of the blackbody , @xmath64 , is similar to those found in nls1 galaxies ( brandt & boller 1998 ) . that this object is similar to the nls1 galaxies in its nature ,",
    "is further supported by the optical spectroscopic properties of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 ( see below ) .",
    "the excess soft x - ray emission of nls1 galaxies is usually attributed to a higher accretion rate compared to the eddington accretion rate ( @xmath65 ) ( pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ; brandt & boller 1998 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , @xmath66 , is about a factor of @xmath0 higher than the eddington luminosity for a @xmath67 bh .",
    "thus eddington or super - eddington accretion rate is required in rx  j1334.2 + 3759 provided that the mass of the central bh is @xmath68 .      the optical spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , shown in fig",
    ". 6 , appears to be typical of nls1 galaxies .",
    "the fwhm velocity ( @xmath15 ) of the broad components of balmer lines in the spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is similar to that found in the other nls1 galaxies but is significantly lower than in the seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "for example , grupe et al .  ( 1999 ) found mean values of the broad components of h@xmath11 to be @xmath69 for a sample of nls1s , and @xmath70 for a sample of seyfert  1s .",
    "similarly , the ratio of fluxes of narrow and broad components of h@xmath12 and h@xmath11 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , for rx  j1334.2 + 3759 are similar to those found in other nls1 galaxies ( rodriguez - ardila et al .  2000 ) .",
    "this implies that the relative contribution of the broad components to the line flux is greatly reduced in rx  j1334.2 + 3759 compared to that in seyfert  1 galaxies for which the ratio of narrow to broad component is around @xmath73 .",
    "the narrow components of the permitted lines and the forbidden lines such as [ o  iii]@xmath13 , [ n  ii]@xmath29 etc . are thought to arise from the nlr of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "for rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , the flux ratio of [ o  iii]@xmath13 line and the narrow component of h@xmath11 , @xmath34\\lambda5007}{h\\beta_{n}}$ ] , is @xmath74 which is much smaller than the ratio of @xmath21 found in seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "nls1 galaxies , on the other hand , show values ranging from 0.5 to 5 for the @xmath34\\lambda5007}{h\\beta_{n}}$ ] ratio ( see rodriguez - ardila et al .",
    "thus , nlr of rx  j1334 + 3759 is somewhat different from the 7 nls1 galaxies in the sample of rodriguez - ardila et al .  2000 .",
    "rx  j1334.2 + 3759 shows strong fe  ii emission .",
    "the ratio of fluxes of fe  ii and h@xmath11 , @xmath75 , is @xmath76 for rx  j1334.2 + 3759 .",
    "this ratio is similar to those found in the other nls1 galaxies ( see grupe et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the following",
    ", we try to explain the observed flux ratios from the nlr and blr of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 and the other nls1 galaxies in terms of density enhancements . in the same picture",
    ", we also try to explain the well known anti - correlation between the slope of the soft x - ray continuum and the fwhm of h@xmath11 line found in nls1 galaxies .",
    "eddington or super - eddington accretion rates , thought to be responsible for the steep soft x - ray continua in nls1s ( see pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ; brandt & boller 1998 ) , may result in outflows . in",
    "the nlr of nls1 galaxies , the flux ratio @xmath34\\lambda5007}{h\\beta_{n}}$ ] is smaller than the ratio found in the normal seyfert galaxies .",
    "this smaller value can be produced by a smaller size of the nlr in nls1 galaxies .",
    "outflows can enhance the density of the blr and extend its size outwards , thereby reducing the size of the nlr . in this scenario ,",
    "the flux of the [ o  iii]@xmath13 line will be reduced while that of the narrow component of permitted lines will not be . rather",
    ", the flux in the narrow components of the permitted lines is expected to increase due to an enhancement of the density .",
    "thus , a smaller ratio of [ o  iii]@xmath13 and h@xmath77 can be produced in the nlr of nls1 galaxies .",
    "the fwhm of the broad component of h@xmath11 line is significantly smaller in the nls1 galaxies than those found in seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "it seems that in the nls1 galaxies , appropriate physical conditions , where the maximum number of broad component h@xmath11 photons can be produced , are located at a larger radial distance from the nucleus than in the normal seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "this radial shift seems to be possible due to outflows and a resulting enhancement in the density .",
    "the inner regions of the blr in the nls1 galaxies can be expected to be fully ionized in hydrogen due to higher ionizing power of the steeper ionizing continua , and the temperature there can be higher than in the inner blr of the seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "these kind of physical conditions in the inner blr of the nls1s will not , however , produce an appreciable number of h@xmath11 photons , while the outer regions of the blr will have favorable physical conditions to generate a copious number of h@xmath11 photons .",
    "uv emission lines , which probe the inner blr , are expected to be broader than the h@xmath11 line .",
    "thus , an enhancement of the density due to outflows can explain ( a ) the lower width of h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 in the nls1s compared to seyfert  1 galaxies , and ( b ) comparable width of the permitted lines in the uv spectra of nls1 galaxies compared to seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that a relatively high density ( @xmath78 ) blr has been inferred from the uv spectrum of i  zw  1  a prototype nls1 object ( laor et al .",
    ". there is also observational evidence for outflows in the nls1 galaxies e.g. , a weak uv absorption system with a line of sight outflow velocity of @xmath79 has been detected from i  zw  1 ( laor et al .",
    "outflows in three other nls1 galaxies , viz .",
    ", akn  564 , wpvs007 and rx  j0134.2 - 4258 , have also been observed by the presence of uv absorption lines in their spectra ( goodrich 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , leighly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found evidence for relativistic outflows in the @xmath80 spectra of 3 nls1 galaxies .",
    "higher accretion rates that would likely produce stronger outflows thus pushing the blr further radially outward thereby resulting in narrower balmer lines in the nls1 objects , also result in steeper soft x - ray continua .",
    "thus , a variation in the higher accretion rate can result in the observed anti - correlation between the slope of the soft x - ray continua and the width of the h@xmath11 line in the nls1 objects .",
    "another advantage of the above picture is that the strong outflows can result in shocks which may be responsible for the fe  ii emission observed in the nls1 galaxies .",
    "collin & joly ( 2000 ) have shown that the standard photoionization models with any set of parameters can not produce the observed strength of the fe  ii emission in the nls1 galaxies , and have suggested that non - radiative heating , for instance , shock heating for the production of fe  ii emission .",
    "\\(i ) rx  j1334.2 + 3759 , a newly discovered narrow - line quasar , is highly luminous in soft x - rays ( @xmath81 in the energy band of 0.12.0  kev ) .",

    "<S> changes in the intensity by a factor of @xmath0 have been detected in the @xmath1 pspc observations of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 on time scales of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> rapid variability events have also been observed from rx  j1334.2 + 3759 . </S>",
    "<S> the most extreme variable event has @xmath3 corresponding to a change in intensity by a factor of @xmath4 within @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the pspc spectra of the nlqso can be well represented by a power - law of photon index , @xmath6 modified by an absorbing column local to the source ( @xmath7 ) over and above that due to our own galaxy ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is estimated to be @xmath9 in the energy band of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectrum of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 is typical of the nls1 galaxies showing strong balmer h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 , and forbidden line of [ o iii]@xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> the narrow - line region of rx  j1334.2 + 3759 appears to be significantly different from those of normal seyfert galaxies . a possible explanation for the observed properties of the narrow line region and the broad line region is suggested in terms of density enhancements .    </S>",
