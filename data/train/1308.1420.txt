    "naturally , steady - state velocity - weakening ( denoted hereafter as svw ) friction has been studied extensively . on the other hand ,",
    "less attention has been given to steady - state velocity - strengthening ( denoted hereafter as svs ) friction , in which the steady - state frictional resistance increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of svs might affect , for example , the propagation speed of rupture fronts , their propagation distance and possibly the amount of stored energy released by them .",
    "our goal in this note is to discuss svs friction , its functional form and possible physical origins , and to point out direct evidence for its existence based on experimental data available in the literature .",
    "the interface between two macroscopic bodies in dry frictional contact is typically composed of an ensemble of contact asperities whose total area @xmath1 is orders of magnitude smaller than the nominal contact area @xmath2 .",
    "the real contact area typically depends on the time elapsed since a contact was formed , i.e. on the contact s `` age '' ( or `` maturity '' ) typically quantified by a state variable of time dimension @xmath3 @xcite , an idea that dates back at least to @xcite . the frictional stress ( resistance )",

    "we suggest that svs friction , @xmath15 , generically emerges in dry friction over some range of slip velocities , discuss its possible physical origins and the available experimental evidence for its existence .",

    "it is repeated here briefly for completeness .",
    "the starting point is the non - steady behavior of @xmath5 in the absence of slip , @xmath20 . in this case",

    "this expression , however , can not be valid for arbitrarily short times as it becomes singular for @xmath29 , which is of course unphysical .",
    "this simply means that @xmath23 actually takes the form @xmath30 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 can be interpreted as a typical cutoff time scale for the onset of logarithmic aging .",
    "equation ( [ wrong aging ] ) provides a good approximation for eq .",
    "( [ right aging ] ) when @xmath31 , but completely fails in the opposite limit , @xmath32 .",
    "the last equation , and specifically the short - time cutoff , has been proposed by @xcite , has been verified experimentally @xcite and has been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "while this might appear as a somewhat academic discussion of a short time regularization of the logarithmic aging formula , and indeed it is almost always overlooked , this is not the case . to see the relevance of this short time regularization for our purposes here",
    ", we should consider steady sliding at a velocity @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath3 quantifies the age of the real contact it must be a decreasing function of @xmath0 ( the `` lifetime '' of a contact asperity is shorter the higher the slip velocity , i.e. `` rejuvenation '' ) . it is well established that under steady - state conditions @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a typical slip distance ( usually related to the contact asperities size ) @xcite . therefore , under steady - state sliding conditions the real contact area takes the form @xmath35 \\ .\\ ] ] this implies that @xmath19 decreases logarithmically with increasing @xmath0 for @xmath36 @xcite and that it approaches a constant ( saturates ) for @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , if indeed the rheological contribution to the steady - state frictional resistance increases with @xmath0 , @xmath38 , we conclude that _ irrespective _ of the precise form of @xmath39 we expect @xmath15 for @xmath37 .",
    "this is an important observation .",
    "the last section concluded with the observation that the steady - state frictional stress ( resistance ) @xmath11 is expected to become velocity - strengthening above a certain slip velocity @xmath40 due to the saturation of the real contact area , assuming @xmath38 .",
    "our goal in this section , and the subsequent one , is to discuss the latter .",
    "the standard approach to the velocity dependence of the rheological part of the frictional stress ( `` shear strength '' ) is to attribute it to thermal activation @xcite .",
    "we briefly repeat the argument here as it sets the stage for what will follow .",
    "the starting point is to treat the real contact of area @xmath5 as fixed , to neglect any rheological internal variables @xmath6 and to assume that @xmath0 is a result of a stress - biased thermally activated process such that @xmath41-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\delta(-\\tau)}{k_b t}\\right ] \\right ) \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath42 is a reference velocity scale related to a basic attempt rate and an intrinsic length scale , @xmath43 is a stress - biased activation barrier , @xmath44 is boltzman s constant and @xmath45 is the temperature .",
    "the second exponential appears in order to account for backwards transitions ( implying a proper @xmath46 symmetry and consistency with the second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "the stress - biased activation barrier is assumed to take the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bare energy barrier , @xmath49 is the activation volume ( typically much larger than atomic volumes , i.e. corresponding to a collective multi - atom process @xcite ) and @xmath50 is the local stress at the asperity level .",

    "( [ nonsteady ] ) and @xmath60 can be readily identified .",
    "equation ( [ tau1 ] ) predicts that the instantaneous response ( i.e. faster than the typical evolution time of @xmath3 ) of the frictional stress to slip velocity `` jumps '' would be logarithmic in the ratio between the final and the initial @xmath0 s .",
    "this logarithmic `` direct effect '' @xcite has been observed for many materials in a wide range of slip velocities @xmath0 , but typically not larger than a few hundreds of @xmath61m / sec .    what are the implications of eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) for the steady - state frictional stress @xmath11 ? to answer this question",

    "the aging coefficient @xmath25 is typically much smaller than unity ( for many materials it is of the order of @xmath66 @xcite ) and we expect @xmath67 .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 , which sets the overall magnitude of the friction coefficient , is roughly of order unity ( as is widely observed ) , and that @xmath69 .",
    "these estimates suggest that the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsf ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath70 , is small compared to the other @xmath0-dependent terms in this equation and hence will be neglected hereafter ( unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "consider then relatively small slip velocities that satisfy @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath72 is logarithmic and we have @xmath73 the sign of the last expression , which is controlled by the relative magnitudes of @xmath25 and @xmath74 ( or alternatively of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , determines whether friction is velocity - weakening or velocity - strengthening in this range of slip velocities . in particular , for @xmath77 friction",
    "is velocity - weakening and for @xmath78 it is velocity - strengthening . in the former case ,",
    "steady - state friction is velocity - weakening for @xmath71 and then it crosses over to velocity - strengthening behavior for @xmath37 , when @xmath5 approaches a constant . in the latter case ,",
    "friction is logarithmically velocity - strengthening for slip velocities both below and above @xmath79 , but with different pre - factors in each regime .",
    "indeed , in some systems such as clay - rich fault gauge layers , velocity - strengthening friction is the rule rather than the exception @xcite .",
    "the most important implication then of eqs .",
    "( [ ass ] ) and ( [ tau1 ] ) , for our purposes here , is that they predict that steady - state friction is logarithmically velocity - strengthening for @xmath37 .",
    "this is often overlooked in parts of the literature , but see @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ exp_evidence]a - b we present examples from the available literature in which logarithmic svw friction crosses over to logarithmic svs behavior at some slip velocity @xmath80 ( where the curve reaches a minimum ) . the data in fig .",
    "[ exp_evidence]c also exhibit logarithmic svs .",
    "as discussed above , a simple thermal activation model predicts the existence of logarithmic svs friction above a slip velocity @xmath40 . this model assumes a single activation barrier and a single attempt rate",
    "; many of the materials of interest , however , are disordered and hence a distribution of activation barriers and time scales might be relevant .",
    "moreover , the linear dependence of the activation barrier on @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ linear_bias ] ) might not be always valid . in spite of these simplifications and possible limitations , we adopt this framework and ask whether the logarithmic velocity - strengthening behavior might break down at some point .",
    "obviously , the simple thermal activation picture breaks down when the stress - biased barrier in eq .",
    "( [ linear_bias ] ) becomes comparable to @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , the breakdown occurs when the slip velocity @xmath0 is not much smaller than @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "there is , however , no easy way to independently estimate both @xmath42 and @xmath48 , which are coupled in eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) . moreover , as @xmath48 appears in the exponential , small variations in it can be compensated by a huge variation in @xmath42 , which suggests a large uncertainty in the latter .",
    "nevertheless , some arguments for independently estimating @xmath42 have appeared in the literature . for example , @xcite estimated @xmath42 for rocks ( quartzite and granite ) to be in the mm / sec range , which sets an upper bound for the validity of the thermal activation process and hence for logarithmic velocity - strengthening ( assuming , for the moment , that @xmath81 ) .    what happens for larger slip velocities , @xmath82 , when thermal activation breaks down ? while we suspect that the answer might be material - specific , we believe that rather generically steady - state friction remains velocity - strengthening in this regime ( at least until thermal weakening possibly intervenes , see section [ summary ] ) , with a functional dependence which is typically _ stronger than logarithmic_. our basic argument is that the breakdown of the thermal activation process should also signal a change in the dominant energy dissipation mechanism associated with frictional dynamics . since logarithmic velocity - strengthening is usually intimately linked to thermal activation , we see no reason for other dissipative processes to give rise to such a weak ( i.e. logarithmic ) dependence on @xmath0 and hence expect the dependence to be stronger than logarithmic .    while we do not aim here at developing a detailed model of the crossover to stronger - than - logarithmic steady - state friction",
    ", we would like to sketch a few possible physical scenarios that might give rise to such a behavior .",
    "we first consider the possibility that logarithmic svs friction crosses over to a linear behavior in which @xmath83 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ exp_evidence]g and fig . 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "this viscous - friction behavior might emerge as a standard viscous process obtained through linearization of a different thermally activated process , characterized by an activation volume significantly smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "that is , if at high slip velocities ( hence higher stresses ) the physics of frictional dissipation changes such that the activation volume @xmath49 decreases from a multi - atom / super - molecular value to an atomic / molecular volume , the thermal activation formula of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) remains valid , but now @xmath84 ( recall that @xmath85 ) and linearization leading to @xmath86 is sensible ( _ caroli _ , private communication , 2013 ) .    another mechanism that may lead a crossover to a linear viscous behavior is well - known in the context of dislocation mechanics @xcite . in this case , at relatively small mean dislocation velocities and applied stresses , dislocation motion is thermally activated with the barriers determined by local obstacles of various types and the peierls lattice potential . at higher velocities and stresses , interactions with phonons and electrons control dislocation motion , leading to a linear drag - like relation between the stress and the velocity @xcite .",
    "a crossover from a thermally activated regime at low slip velocities to a non - thermally activated regime at higher slip velocities has been briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the idea there was that plastic rearrangements at contact asperities give rise to mesoscopic stress fields that perturb nearby regions .",
    "the accumulated effect of these random spatiotemporal perturbations , originating from various plastic rearrangements taking place at different locations and times , can be regarded as a dynamical / mechanical noise , which acts in parallel to the ordinary thermal noise .",
    "this dynamical / mechanical noise becomes more intense as @xmath0 increases and eventually takes over the thermal noise .",
    "while the precise functional form of the velocity - strengthening frictional response associated with the dynamical / mechanical noise - controlled regime has not been discussed , it was implied that it is stronger than the logarithmic dependence associated with the thermal noise - controlled regime ( cf .",
    "17 in @xcite ) .",
    "another physical scenario for the velocity - strengthening frictional response in the non - thermally activated regime might be based on applying bagnold s scaling arguments , originally developed in the context of dense granular flows @xcite , to atomic / molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the idea is that when thermal activation is irrelevant , the system has no characteristic energy scale and flow rates are controlled by collisions between hard - core - like objects , where the detailed molecular interactions are not playing a central role . in this case , the frictional stress @xmath4 is proportional to the product of the momentum transfer per collision and the rate of collisions , both linear in @xmath0 , leading to @xmath87 . while the application of bagnold s scaling arguments to atomic / molecular systems might be questionable , our goal here is just to highlight another known mechanism for a velocity - strengthening type of response .    in strictly athermal frictional interfaces ,",
    "e.g. frictional interfaces composed of granular materials such as fault gouge , where the elementary units are macroscopic and no thermal motion takes place , we do not expect logarithmic velocity - strengthening to emerge . in this case",
    ", one might expect logarithmic velocity - weakening friction at small slip velocities , due to logarithmic aging of the contacts between grains , to cross over to a stronger - than - logarithmic velocity - strengthening friction associated with nonlinear plastic rheology .",
    "this is precisely what has been observed and discussed very recently in @xcite ( see also fig . [ exp_evidence]h ) .",
    "finally , we note that there might exist additional strengthening mechanisms , that go beyond the somewhat idealized multi - contact interfaces picture discussed above , associated with wear and gouge accumulation .",
    "for example , the nonmonotonic steady - state friction of sierra white granite shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_evidence]i , including both velocity - weakening and velocity - strengthening behaviors , has been suggested to be directly controlled by the rate of wear formation @xcite .",
    "the role of comminution as a dissipative mechanism that leads to frictional strengthening has been extensively discussed and demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this qualitative discussion of possible physical mechanisms that might give rise to stronger - than - logarithmic velocity - strengthening friction when thermal activation breaks down is only meant to show that such mechanisms are conceivable .",
    "the generic picture that emerges is that in thermal systems , when @xmath42 is sufficiently larger than @xmath79 and @xmath77 , we expect logarithmic svw friction to cross over to logarithmic svs friction at slip velocities @xmath88 , which in turn crosses over to stronger - than - logarithmic velocity - strengthening friction at slip velocities @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath89 , we expect logarithmic svs friction to cross over to stronger - than - logarithmic velocity - strengthening friction , not due to the saturation of the real contact area , but rather because stronger - than - logarithmic strengthening takes over logarithmic weakening .",
    "this is also the case for strictly athermal frictional interfaces .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that while the discussion above  starting with eq .",
    "( [ nonsteady ] )  has focussed primarily on frictional interfaces whose contact asperities deform plastically , a similar picture has been discussed by byerlee in the context of frictional interfaces composed of geological materials governed by brittle fracture of asperities @xcite .",
    "moreover , we would like to draw the readers attention to the work of estrin and brchet @xcite , who seem to discuss somewhat related ideas . finally , it is important to mention that in the context of lubrication , i.e. frictional interfaces that contain fluids , the generic steady - state dry friction curve @xmath11 discussed here is the standard known as the `` stribeck curve '' @xcite . in this curve",
    ", solid contact dominates at small slip velocities and hydrodynamic viscous friction dominates at high slip velocities , with a mixed regime in between , where friction goes through a minimum .",
    "[ sec : evidence ] to test the physical picture described above , we have searched the available literature , looking for steady - state friction experiments that go up to sufficiently high slip velocities . while these experiments are not easy to perform , and sometimes require to employ different experimental techniques in different ranges of slip velocities , we have been able to trace quite a few examples that lend support to the proposed picture .",

    "note , however , that in some cases ( e.g. the clay - rich gouge layers data in fig .",

    "the existence of velocity - strengthening friction might have serious implications for various frictional phenomena .",

    "<S> the onset of frictional instabilities , e.g. earthquakes nucleation , is intimately related to velocity - weakening friction , in which the frictional resistance of interfaces decreases with increasing slip velocity . while this frictional response has been studied extensively , </S>",
    "<S> less attention has been given to steady - state velocity - strengthening friction , in spite of its potential importance for various aspects of frictional phenomena such as the propagation speed of interfacial rupture fronts and the amount of stored energy released by them . </S>",
    "<S> in this note we suggest that a crossover from steady - state velocity - weakening friction at small slip velocities to steady - state velocity - strengthening friction at higher velocities might be a generic feature of dry friction . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that while thermally activated rheology naturally gives rise to logarithmic steady - state velocity - strengthening friction , a crossover to stronger - than - logarithmic strengthening might take place at higher slip velocities , possibly accompanied by a change in the dominant dissipation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we sketch a few physical mechanisms that may account for the crossover to stronger - than - logarithmic steady - state velocity - strengthening and compile a rather extensive set of experimental data available in the literature , lending support to these ideas . </S>"
