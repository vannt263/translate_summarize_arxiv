    "for a metric space @xmath6 with a notion of volume and boundary , an isoperimetric inequality gives a lower bound on the boundary of a set of fixed volume .",
    "ideally , for any fixed volume , it produces a set of that volume with minimal boundary .",
    "the most well - known isoperimetric inequality states that , in euclidean space , the unique set of fixed volume with minimal boundary is the euclidean ball .",
    "a graph @xmath7 can be defined as a metric space in the usual way : for @xmath8 , @xmath9 for a graph , an isoperimetric inequality gives a lower bound on the boundary of a set @xmath10 of a given size .",
    "the term `` boundary '' here can be interpreted in two standard ways : the vertex boundary or the edge boundary .",
    "the vertex boundary is typically defined as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 in words : the vertex boundary of @xmath13 is the set @xmath13 itself , along with all of the neighbors of @xmath13 . the vertex boundary of various graphs has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .    in this paper , we use another definition for boundary : the edge boundary . the edge boundary is defined as follows : @xmath14 in words : the edge boundary of @xmath13 is the set of edges exiting the set @xmath13 .",
    "many different types of graphs have been studied in terms of the edge isoperimetric question , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although the vertex and edge isoperimetric inequalities have similar statements , often the resulting optimal sets ( and thus the techniques used in their proofs ) are quite different . indeed",
    ", this will be the case for the family of graphs that we consider : @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the vertices of @xmath17 are the integer points @xmath0 in @xmath18 .",
    "the edges @xmath19 are between pairs of points whose @xmath1-distance is 1 : @xmath20 where if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 in @xcite , the author and a.j .",
    "radcliffe gave the vertex isoperimetric inequality for @xmath23 .",
    "the sets of minimum vertex boundary are nested , and the technique of compression was used to prove this .",
    "compression relies heavily on the fact that sets of minimum boundary are nested .",
    "discussions of compression as a technique in discrete isoperimetric problems can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , sets of size @xmath24 with minimum vertex boundary in @xmath25 are squares of side length @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , if a set has size which is not a perfect square , then the set achieving optimality will be a rectangular box , or a rectangular box with a strip on one side of the box .",
    "optimal sets of sizes 1 through 8 in @xmath27 are shown in figure [ boxes ]",
    ".    however , these are not the types of sets which achieve optimal edge boundary .",
    "for example , figure [ edge1_1 ] shows a set of size 12 with 36 outgoing edges .",
    "it also has 20 vertex neighbors .",
    "in contrast , figure [ edge1_2 ] shows a set of size 12 with 38 outgoing edges and 18 vertex neighbors .",
    "the set in figure [ edge1_2 ] has minimal vertex boundary , but in comparison to the set in figure [ edge1_1 ] , it can not have minimal edge boundary .",
    "an example in the literature of differing optimal sets when considering vertex boundary versus edge boundary can be found in the graph @xmath28 .",
    "this graph has edge set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the integers modulo @xmath31 .",
    "the edge set consists of all pairs of points whose @xmath32 distance is 1 : @xmath33 where for @xmath34 and @xmath35 we have @xmath36 in @xcite bollobs and leader show that the optimal sets for the vertex isoperimetric problem are nested .",
    "in fact , they correspond to balls using the @xmath32-metric .",
    "this is proved using compression , along with the concepts of fractional systems and symmetrization .",
    "however , in @xcite , bollobs and leader show that the optimal sets for the _ edge _ isoperimetric problem on the same graph are not nested .",
    "they use rectilinear bodies to aid in computing their isoperimetric inequalities .",
    "we note that we use the _ unordered pair _ notation for the edges @xmath19 .",
    "that is , if @xmath37 , then we consider @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is not too hard to calculate the edge boundary for a general set @xmath2 in the graph @xmath23 .",
    "first we require a couple of definitions .    for @xmath2 and @xmath40 ,",
    "let @xmath41 be the projection of @xmath42 onto @xmath43 .",
    "that is , @xmath44 where for @xmath34 and @xmath45 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\left < u,\\epsilon\\right > & = \\sum_{i=1}^n u_i \\epsilon_i \\\\     we also need the following :    let @xmath2 be finite . for @xmath40 with @xmath47 ,",
    "we define @xmath48 thus , one can think of a point @xmath49 as the first vertex in @xmath0 which indicates a gap in @xmath42 in the line through @xmath50 in the direction of @xmath51 .",
    "we have the following :    [ gapthm ] let @xmath2 be a finite set .",
    ". if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 for each @xmath55 .",
    "we can also see that if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 we can also see that in this case , @xmath58 for each @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath60 if @xmath61 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath62 .",
    "fix @xmath63 . by induction ,",
    "@xmath64 consider what @xmath65 contributes to the edge boundary of @xmath42 .",
    "note that each @xmath3 can be uniquely paired with @xmath66 .",
    "we have three cases :    in this case , @xmath67 and @xmath68 thus we can see that both the left and right hand sides of equation go down by 2 corresponding to edges @xmath69 when @xmath65 is added back to @xmath42 .    here , without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 and @xmath72    thus we can see that both the left and right hand sides of equation do not change corresponding to edges @xmath69 when @xmath65 is added back to @xmath42 .    in this case ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74    thus we can see that both the left and right hand sides of equation go up by 2 corresponding to edges @xmath69 when @xmath65 is added back to @xmath42 .    since @xmath51 was arbitrary , we can see that all of the changes between @xmath75 and @xmath76 are balanced out by changes in the corresponding gaps .",
    "thus , we have @xmath77 clearly has the following corollary :    let @xmath2 be a finite set such that @xmath54 for each @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath78-dimensional projections of @xmath42 , and is a nice counterpoint to the vertex boundary calculations in @xcite .",
    "this leads to the natural desire to show that it is possible to `` squish '' any set @xmath2 to form a new set @xmath79 such that @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath79 has no gaps ( that is , @xmath82 for each @xmath3 ) .    in the following section ,",
    "we show how we can `` squish '' set @xmath42 into set @xmath83 so that @xmath84 , and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath87th standard basis vector .",
    "the following notation and definitions are similar to those in @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we introduce the following notation : for a real - valued vector @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , we define @xmath90 in words , @xmath91 is the vector that results when placing @xmath50 in the @xmath87th coordinate of @xmath92 and shifting the @xmath87th through @xmath31th coordinates of @xmath92 to the right .            in words :",
    "after fixing a coordinate @xmath98 , we consider all lines in @xmath0 where only the @xmath87th coordinate varies , and we intersect those lines with @xmath42 .",
    "each of the points in those intersections are moved along the line so that they are a segment centered around 0 .",
    "the result is @xmath83 .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 and fix @xmath98 .",
    "first we note that we can count the edge boundary of @xmath42 by partitioning the outgoing edges of @xmath42 into the sets of edges coming from each 1-dimensional @xmath87-section of @xmath42 . specifically for @xmath94 , let @xmath100 then we have @xmath101 and the above union is disjoint .",
    "we can partition these even further , based on which 1-dimensional section the vertex which is not in @xmath42 lies . that is ,",
    "if @xmath37 with @xmath63 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , then we must have @xmath105 for some @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( specifically , @xmath108 ) .",
    "let @xmath109 then @xmath110 and the union is disjoint .",
    "thus , we have          thus , we can now consider a fixed @xmath92 and fixed @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the lines of vertices in @xmath42 corresponding to fixing all entries except the @xmath87th by the entries in vectors @xmath92 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "note that we can visualize these lines as integer points in the plane , with the lines parallel to the @xmath50-axis .    for all of our visualizations , the upper line will denote @xmath31 , the lower line @xmath121 .",
    "open circles are vertices in @xmath31 or @xmath121 , filled in circles are vertices which are not in @xmath31 or @xmath121 .",
    "the solid lines are edges which are definitely in @xmath122 ; the dotted lines are edges which may be in @xmath123 ( depending on whether particular vertices are in @xmath121 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "see figure [ visualizationp ] .",
    "we claim that we can rearrange the vertices within @xmath121 and @xmath31 by perhaps changing the @xmath87th coordinate of some vertices to make new lines of vertices @xmath129 and @xmath130 with no gaps , such that @xmath131 .",
    "we do this in a sequence of steps .    first note that if both @xmath121 and @xmath31 have a gap at @xmath124 , then the vertices of @xmath121 to the left of the gap and the vertices of @xmath31 to the left of the gap can all be shifted to the right by 1 without increasing @xmath132 ; only possibly decreasing @xmath132 ( see figure [ sampleshift ] ) .            1",
