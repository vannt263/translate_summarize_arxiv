    "one of the most important features of an interacting quantum many - body system is its response to external oscillating fields .",
    "the collective modes , which are expected to dominate the low frequency response , represent a very effective tool for probing the role of interactions and testing theoretical schemes .",
    "for this reason , measurements of collective modes in the trapped gases of alkali atoms @xcite were carried out soon after the discovery of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "the remarkable agreement between measured frequencies and theoretical predictions @xcite is one of the first important achievements in the investigation of these new systems .",
    "it provides also a clean _ a posteriori _ justification of the mean - field scheme , based on the formalism of gross - pitaevskii theory @xcite , which is the starting point of most calculations .",
    "this theoretical approach is expected to give indeed an accurate description of the ground state and the excited states of such dilute interacting gases at low temperature .",
    "the same scheme , when the atom - atom interaction becomes dominant compared with the zero - point quantum pressure , reduces to the thomas - fermi approximation for the ground state and to the equations of nondissipative hydrodynamics for the excited states @xcite .",
    "this is particularly useful for discussing the relevant physical properties by means of analytic or semi - analytic results , taking advantage of the simplicity and clarity of the hydrodynamic equations .    the same mean - field approach ,",
    "which correctly reproduces the frequency of the normal modes of the trapped gas in the linear limit ( small oscillations around the ground state ) , is suitable to investigating also the nonlinear dynamics of the systems @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity is included in the equations of motion through the mean - field , which is proportional to the condensate density .",
    "thus , measurable effects of nonlinearity could represent further clean signatures of bose - einstein condensation . among them , large amplitude oscillations of the condensate can be easily produced in the trapped gases @xcite ; nonlinear effects are expected to give rise to frequency shift , mode coupling , harmonic generation and stochastic motion .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to derive simple differential equations for large amplitude oscillations within the formalism of hydrodynamics .",
    "in particular we will provide analytic formulae for the frequency shift of three collective modes in a generic axially - symmetric trap .",
    "these formulae allow us to discuss the important role played by the anisotropy of the trap .",
    "we will show that special values of the anisotropy parameter ( the ratio of the axial and radial frequencies of the trap ) can be associated with strong nonlinear effects even for oscillations of relatively small amplitude .",
    "the same analytic results have interesting consequences in the theory of collapse and revival of the condensate .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic formalism .",
    "then , in section [ sec : oscillations ] , we discuss how the collective modes can be driven and analysed numerically . in section [ sec :",
    "analytic ] we perform a small amplitudes expansion and derive analytic solutions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes and their frequency shifts . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss both the numerical and the analytic results for different traps .",
    "an application to the theory of collapse and revival of the the oscillations is given in section [ sec : collapse ] .",
    "the paper will end with a short summary .",
    "let us start with the hydrodynamic equations in thomas - fermi approximation @xcite : @xmath2 @xmath3 density and velocity are related to the condensate wave function @xmath4 through @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the density is normalized to the number of particles in the condensate , @xmath7 .",
    "the external confining potential has the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the trapping frequencies can depend on time , @xmath10 , in the presence of an external driving force .",
    "their static values , @xmath11 , fix the equilibrium configuration of the system . for cylindrically symmetric traps one can define the radial frequency @xmath12 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the external potential provides also the typical length scale of the system in each direction , @xmath14 .",
    "since the system is dilute , the atom - atom interaction enters only through the quantity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-wave scattering length .",
    "the equations of nondissipative hydrodynamics are equivalent to the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function in the limit @xmath18 , if the interaction is repulsive ( @xmath19 ) . in this case , the effects of the zero point kinetic energy ( quantum pressure ) become negligible and the gas is dominated by the balance of the internal and external potential energies . the stationary solution of the hydrodynamic equations",
    "is the thomas - fermi ground state @xcite : @xmath20 \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\hbox{for } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\mu \\ge v_{ext}({\\bf r } )    \\label{tfgs}\\ ] ] where the chemical potential @xmath21 is fixed by the normalization of the density to the number of particle @xmath22 .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach works in an excellent way for the lowest collective modes of the sodium atoms trapped at mit @xcite , where @xmath22 is of the order of 1 million and more .",
    "conversely , it provides only a semi - quantitative description of the rubidium gas first trapped at jila @xcite , where the number of atoms was smaller ( @xmath23-@xmath24 ) . even in that case , however , the measured frequencies converge nicely to the hydrodynamic predictions for the largest values of @xmath22 .",
    "compared with the numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , the hydrodynamic formalism has the advantage of providing analytic results for the dispersion law of the collective modes and for other useful quantities .",
    "as already discussed in our previous paper @xcite , exact solutions of the hydrodynamic equations can be found in the form @xmath25 \\ ; , \\label{scalingv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] restricted to the region where @xmath26 . with this choice , equations ( [ continuity]-[euler ] ) transform into a set of coupled differential equations for the time - dependent coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "one of them is fixed by the conservation of @xmath22 : @xmath29 .",
    "the equations for the others can be further simplified by introducing the new variables @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations then yield @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "these equations describe the time evolution of the widths of the atomic cloud , since the new variables @xmath30 are directly related to the mean square radii and velocities of the system @xcite : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "different derivations of equations ( [ ddotb ] ) and some applications are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . a variational approach including the zero point quantum pressure , beyond the thomas - fermi approximation , has been also presented in ref .",
    "note again that the frequencies @xmath37 , entering the second term of ( [ ddotb ] ) , can depend on time and , hence , these equations can be used for describing time varying traps , as well as the expansion of the gas after a sudden switching - off of the confining potential .",
    "the set of solutions defined by the scaling transformations ( [ scalingrho]-[scalingv ] ) does not exhaust all possible motions of the trapped gas .",
    "for instance , the motion of the center of mass can be included by adding terms linear in @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 and other solutions can be found including terms of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "however , they are well suited to study the collective modes of lowest multipolarity and energy , namely the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , where @xmath44 is the azimuthal angular momentum in the cylindrically symmetric trap . in the following",
    "we will apply equation ( [ ddotb ] ) to these modes in the nonlinear regime .",
    "at equilibrium one has @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "one can perturb the system by modulating the trap frequencies for a certain time and then let it oscillate freely . formally",
    ", this means that equations ( [ ddotb ] ) have to be solved using a time dependent frequency of the form @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 is an appropriate sinusoidal function within a finite time interval , while the factor @xmath49 is introduced for convenience .",
    "an example is given in fig .  1 for the case of a trap with asymmetry parameter @xmath50 , as in jila experiments .",
    "starting from equilibrium , an oscillation is induced by choosing @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with a driving frequency @xmath54 .",
    "the driving force is switched - off at @xmath55 .",
    "the three curves correspond to the width @xmath56 plotted for different values of the driving strength , @xmath57 .",
    "the free oscillations are undamped , since the theory is restricted to zero temperature and does not include any dissipation .",
    "in the small amplitude limit , @xmath58 , the oscillation coincides with the @xmath1 normal mode predicted by the linearized hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a quadrupole - type excitation in the @xmath41-plane . for larger amplitudes , the response of the system",
    "is slightly shifted in frequency , as can be seen from the figure , and the oscillations are no more purely sinusoidal .",
    "this is associated with the occurrence of harmonic generation and mode coupling . in a similar way",
    ", one can excite the @xmath0 modes .",
    "the one at low energy corresponds to an in - phase oscillation of the width along @xmath38 and @xmath39 and out - of - phase along @xmath40 .",
    "the one at high energy is an in - phase compressional mode along all directions ( breathing mode ) . in all cases",
    ", one can solve numerically the equations ( [ ddotb ] ) and extract amplitude and frequency of the excited modes .",
    "a simple way consists in doing a best - fit with a sinusoidal function to the appropriate width @xmath59 , after the switching - off of the driving force .",
    "one can also perform a fourier analysis of the signal .",
    "we used both methods , finding the same results provided the time interval contains at least three or four complete oscillations .",
    "evolution in time of the radial width @xmath56 in a trap with @xmath60 .",
    "time is in units of @xmath61 .",
    "the oscillation is driven by an external force for the first @xmath62 time units ; then the condensate oscillates freely .",
    "the three curves correspond to increasing the strength of the driving force ( @xmath63 , see text ) . in the small amplitude limit , the oscillation coincides with the @xmath1 normal mode .",
    "[ fig : m2-jila - eta ]    in order to point out the effects of mode - coupling , it is convenient to introduce suitable combinations of the widths @xmath59 as follows : @xmath64 with @xmath65 inserting these combinations into ( [ ddotb ] ) one obtains equations for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "such equations are completely decoupled in the linear limit , that is , when the perturbations @xmath66 and @xmath67 are much smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "thus , these functions represent the normal modes of the system : @xmath67 is the @xmath1 mode , having frequency @xmath69 , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the low - lying and high - lying @xmath0 modes , respectively , whose frequencies are @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we note also that @xmath73 for any value of @xmath74 .    in fig .  2 we plot the functions @xmath75 for the oscillation of largest amplitude already shown in fig",
    "the driving force is tuned on the @xmath1 mode , @xmath76 , but , due to nonlinear coupling , the low - lying @xmath0 mode , @xmath70 , is also significantly excited , while @xmath71 remains very small .",
    "the coupling between these modes causes the irregular oscillation of @xmath77 , given by ( [ bx ] ) and plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "these oscillations have a very large amplitude ( about @xmath78% of the radial width ) ; for smaller oscillations the coupling with @xmath70 tends to vanish . for the smallest oscillation in fig .",

    "these functions coincide with the @xmath1 , low - lying @xmath0 and high - lying @xmath0 normal modes , respectively .",

    "[ fig : m2-jila - xi ]    a strong enhancement of nonlinear effects can be obtained not only by increasing the strength of the driving force , but also by changing the anisotropy of the trap .",

    "an example is shown in fig .  3 , where we plot the functions @xmath75 for an oscillation driven as in the case of the smallest oscillation in fig .  1 .",
    "the driving force is again tuned on @xmath76 with a relatively small strength , but now the oscillation exhibits a strong nonlinear behavior .",
    "the crucial parameter is the value of @xmath74 , which in fig .  3",
    "is chosen to be @xmath81 . as we will discuss in the next sections , this special value of @xmath74",
    "is associated with a resonance of the two modes @xmath82 and @xmath83 ; indeed , the figure shows an evident beating of these two modes .",

    "the beating is between the @xmath76 mode , which is excited by the external force , and the @xmath71 mode , which is coupled through the second harmonic of @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : m2-res ]    at this point , before presenting further numerical results obtained from equations ( [ ddotb ] ) , we prefer to explore the first nonlinear corrections to the uncoupled normal modes .",

    "the latter belongs to a class of quantum phenomena having no classical analogue .",
    "examples are the collapse and revival of coherent quantum states observed in atomic rydberg wave packets @xcite , in molecular vibrations @xcite and for atoms interacting with an electromagnetic field in a resonant cavity @xcite ( see @xcite and references therein , for a theoretical discussion ) .",
    "the same concepts have been recently applied to the trapped condensate ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this confined bose system",
    ", the collapse of collective excitations originates from a dephasing during the oscillation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dephasing was associated with the fluctuations of the particle occupation number and the collapse time was estimated within hartree approximation .",
    "one of us @xcite has recently developed a theory for the same process , but based on the fluctuations in the number of quanta of oscillation .",
    "the main idea is that a collective mode is , in general , a coherent superposition of stationary states of an oscillator and the number of quanta of oscillations is the natural quantity for classifying those states .",
    "the estimated time scale for the collapse turns out to depend , as a key ingredient , on the frequency shift of the normal modes .",
    "we will recall here the main steps of the theory and then we will use our new results for the frequency shifts in order to provide a quantitative estimate of the collapse time .    as we saw in section",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , the collective variable @xmath170 can be considered as solutions of the equations for anharmonic oscillators .",
    "let us write the frequency , up to the first non linear correction , in the form @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the energy of the oscillations .",
    "we assume here the condition of weak nonlinearity , @xmath173 , even though the theory can be generalized to the case of large amplitude . in order to provide a quantum description ,",
    "one can use the semiclassical expression @xmath174 , which allows one to to rewrite equation ( [ 1 ] ) in the quantum form @xmath175 . here",
    "the quantity @xmath176 is the number of quanta ( @xmath177 ) in a given excited state of energy @xmath178 , while the coefficient @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 .",
    "the oscillations in the experiments @xcite were driven through a sinusoidal force into a coherent state of the oscillator .",

    "if one considers only @xmath186 transitions , the result is @xmath187 $ ] . for small enough values of @xmath188",
    ", one can replace the summation over @xmath176 by an integral and one gets a gaussian damping of the oscillation according to @xmath189 $ ] , where @xmath190 since the amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to @xmath191 , the resulting amplitude dependence of the collapse time , @xmath192 , is the same as in the theory of ref .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath193 gives also the revival period @xmath194 as in ref .",
    "the meaning of @xmath195 and @xmath196 is also shown schematically in fig .",
    "9 . from the expressions for @xmath195 and",
    "@xmath196 one easily sees that @xmath197 .",
    "note that in quantum mechanics the measurement of an oscillator coordinate @xmath170 is , generally speaking , destructive because it affects the oscillator momentum @xmath198 .",
    "in other words , it modifies the coefficients @xmath199 , thus preventing the observation of collapse and revival . in order to measure properly @xmath200 , one must repeat cycles of observations with different replica of the system in different instants of time .",
    "this is , however , exactly the procedure used in the available experiments @xcite .     schematic picture of collapse and revival .",
    "both time and @xmath201 are in arbitrary units and the oscillations are just a pictorial view of the phenomenon .",
    "the two time - scales , @xmath195 and @xmath196 are indicated .",
    "[ fig : collapse ]    according to ( [ 8 ] ) the collapse time @xmath202 decreases when @xmath183 increases .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the theory is restricted to the weak nonlinear regime @xmath203 , which corresponds to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , the collapse time is subject to the condition @xmath205 and the collapse can be observed only if @xmath206 is shorter than the typical time scale for the dissipative damping of the oscillations , which is always present at finite temperature .    in order to provide quantitative estimates of the collapse time for trapped bose condensed gases",
    ", one must calculate the energy of oscillations , @xmath172 , as a function of their amplitude .",
    "this is what we have done in the previous sections .",
    "one has only to write the proper relation between the nonlinearity coefficients @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "to this aim , it is enough to calculate the energy @xmath172 in linear approximation , as twice the mean kinetic energy @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the equilibrium density of condensate and @xmath211 is the velocity field associated with each normal mode .",
    "direct integration for @xmath1 gives : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the amplitude of the mode and @xmath21 is the chemical potential of the system , calculated within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath0 modes one finds @xmath214   \\mu n a_\\mp^2 \\ ; , \\label{e0}\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath215 are defined in ( [ qmp ] ) .",
    "the above energies can be rewritten in a more compact form as @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the appropriate coefficient for each normal mode in ( [ e2]-[e0 ] ) . inserting this result in ( [ 1 ] ) and comparing with the quadratic law ( [ shift ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath218 the final result for the collapse time , from ( [ 8 ] ) , is then @xmath219    let us estimate @xmath202 for the @xmath1 mode , assuming typical experimental parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath220 , @xmath221 hz , @xmath222 and @xmath223 bohr radii . with these parameters",
    "one finds @xmath224 .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath1 mode in the linear limit is @xmath225 , while the coefficient of the quadratic expansion ( [ shift ] ) is @xmath226 .",
    "equation ( [ e2 ] ) gives @xmath227 . with a reasonable choice for the amplitude ,",
    "@xmath228 , the final result for the collapse time is @xmath229 s. the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite reported a lifetime of the @xmath1 mode of the order of @xmath230 ms .",
    "it means that , under the experimental conditions , the dissipative damping is too strong and the collapse can not be observed .",
    "it is not hopeless , however , to discover this effect under appropriate conditions .",
    "the point is that , according both to measurements @xcite and to theoretical considerations @xcite , the dissipative damping decreases rapidly by lowering the temperature of the gas .",
    "we believe that experiments at lower temperature would permit to observe the quantum collapse of collective modes in these macroscopic objects .",
    "it is worth mentioning , in this connection , the recent suggestion to cool adiabatically the gas by changing the trapping frequency @xcite .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0 mode , which also has been observed , exhibits a very small frequency shift and is not , for this reason , a proper object to search for collapse , at least within the range of amplitude where the quadratic expansion ( [ shift ] ) holds .",
    "conversely , the high - lying @xmath0 mode looks more promising . for this mode , using again the parameters of the jila trap , one has @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the oscillations are strongly anisotropic and the amplitude in the @xmath40-direction is larger that in the radial one . according to ( [ bz ] ) one",
    "gets @xmath234 . by assuming again @xmath235 , the collapse time becomes @xmath236 s.    from these results",
    ", it appears evident that the _ resonances _ described in the previous sections of this work are very promising even for the observation of collapse and revival of the oscillations . by a proper choice of the anisotropy parameter @xmath74",
    "one can in fact increase significantly the coefficient @xmath208 and , consequently , lower the collapse time to an observable scale .",
    "obviously , for real traps , one should also take into account possible nonlinear effects originating from trivial nonharmonic corrections to the magnetic confining potential .",
    "but the present scenario for collapse and revival seems plausible and , in any case , the first step for its confirmation should be the observation of the predicted amplitude dependence of the frequency shift .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the behavior of collective excitations of trapped bose gases in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "the formalism of hydrodynamic equations is suitable for deriving both numerical and analytic results , valid in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "as already shown by other authors , those equations describe the lowest collective excitations in the linear regime ( normal modes ) , in agreement with available experiments .",
    "they can be also used for the dynamics of the system in nonlinear regime .",
    "we have shown here that they provide nontrivial predictions for the frequency shift of the normal modes .",
    "we have discussed the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes in a generic cylindrically symmetric trap and we have explored the peculiar behavior of the condensate for special choices of @xmath237 , the asymmetry parameter of the trap . for those special traps , the frequency of an oscillation becomes equal to the second harmonic of another one .",
    "this degeneracy enhances nonlinear effects , producing significant consequences in measurable quantities : for instance , the time evolution of condensate shape can show irregular patterns and the frequency shift can become rather large . the physical picture has been supported by simple analytic results .",
    "we have also discussed an application to the the theory of collapse and revival of the collective oscillations .",
