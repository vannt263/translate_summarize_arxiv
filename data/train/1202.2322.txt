    "developed several years later microscopic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite had shown that the superconducting quantum ( commonly called after this a cooper pair ) is actually two electrons bounded to each other by their interaction via phonons with its total mass being equal to the double electron mass @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and negative charge of the double elementary charge @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the choice of mass in the above equations is arbitrary @xcite while the double negative charge reflects a fundamental fact of pairing of the two electrons with the opposite spins @xcite .",
    "it is postulated that the density @xmath26 of the superconducting electrons is determined by the order parameter @xmath11 according to @xmath27 the expressions for the gl coefficients can be derived from the microscopic theory of superconductivity @xcite : @xmath28 ^ 2\\frac{1}{\\left(k_bt_c\\right)^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 is the density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath30 is planck constant , @xmath6 is a bulk critical temperature of superconductor , and @xmath31 is a coherence length varying with the temperature @xmath2 as @xmath32 it means that the cubicity @xmath1 does not depend on the temperature while the coefficient @xmath20 linearly grows with it , @xmath33 . for the dirty metals ( alloys ) , the value of @xmath34 in and has to be replaced by @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the mean free path of the material @xcite .    for the spatially confined samples , equations",

    "analysis of and manifests that the real value of the extrapolation length ( or the de gennes distance , as it is customarily called on the superconductor slang ) @xmath0 guarantees that no supercurrent flows through the confining surface crossing the interface @xmath37 for the nonzero imaginary part of @xmath0 have been predicted recently @xcite in the framework of linearized gl equations . ] : @xmath40 numerical magnitude of @xmath0 characterizes the intensity of the interaction of the superconductor with the ambient environment and , as a consequence of this , the penetration of the order parameter into it ; in particular , for the border with the vacuum or the insulator its approaches infinity , takes finite positive values for the contact with the normal nonsuperconducting metal and turns to zero while bordering the magnetic material . utilizing bcs equations , it can be shown that , for example , for the superconductor half - space terminated at @xmath41 , the fading propagation of the order parameter into the neighbouring medium at @xmath42 is described as @xcite @xmath43 note that , according to , the cooper pairs can penetrate neither into the vacuum , @xmath44 , ( what is natural ) nor into the magnetics , @xmath45 , as expected , since the spins of all charged carriers in the magnetic material are forced to align in the same direction while in the cooper pair the spins of each constituent electron are antiparallel .",
    "interestingly , for the border with the other superconductor with higher @xmath6 the extrapolation length takes negative values what physically means a surface enhancement of the superconductivity .",
    "this boundary - induced increase of the critical temperature was indeed observed in cold worked in@xmath46bi@xmath47 foils @xcite and tin samples @xcite .",
    "for the former study it was estimated from the increase of the critical temperature that the negative extrapolation length is in the order of micron @xcite , @xmath48 @xmath17 m , while for the latter case it was argued that the magnitude of the de gennes distance can be controlled by , for example , manipulating the abrasive grain size and the annealing time and temperature @xcite .",
    "another method of varying the extrapolation length was proposed recently from the calculation of the influence of the external electric field @xmath49 on superconductors ; namely , it was argued @xcite that its application perpendicular to the interface transforms the zero - field de gennes distance @xmath50 into its total counterpart @xmath51 : @xmath52 with the voltage @xmath53 being expressed through the parameters of the gl theory : @xmath54 here , dimensionless gl parameter @xmath55 is the ratio of the zero - temperature london penetration length @xmath56 to the coherence length , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is superconductor ionic background permittivity , and @xmath59 is the speed of light . while for the classical ( low-@xmath6 ) materials with the small @xmath55 the magnitude of @xmath53 reaches high values of @xmath60 v , for the high-@xmath6 superconductors with the large gl parameter , @xmath61 , it drops significantly to the value of several tens of volts @xcite .    in the absence of the magnetic fields , equations   and",

    "the procedure of determining the temperature through the lowest eigenenergy @xmath66 of and/or is widely used in the superconductor research @xcite and will be implemented below too . note that the effective potential @xmath64 is always nonnegative and , accordingly , taking into account of the cubic term leads to the decrease of the temperature @xmath2 from .",
    "this has a natural physical explanation : the superconducting carriers density @xmath3 , which is proportional to the square order parameter too , grows with the decrease of the temperature and , accordingly , the role of the nonlinear term becomes more prominent as well .",
    "armed with the experimental and theoretical knowledge discovered during last fifteen - twenty years , we readdress here the problem of the gl description of the properties of the straight superconducting film in the absence of the magnetic fields , @xmath68 , partially discussed in the mid 1960s @xcite and in 1993 @xcite .",
    "even though some basic equations for this geometry have been derived before , their analysis in the just cited references was limited to the linear case and nonnegative @xmath0 only .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the critical film width @xmath69 at which the superconductivity emerges , depends on @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath70 linearized gl theory at the negative @xmath0 was also discussed recently for the same configuration @xcite .",
    "below , we provide a complete analysis of the temperature @xmath2 dependence on the cubicity @xmath1 , superdensity @xmath3 and the extrapolation length @xmath0 . for achieving this",
    ", we analytically solve with the gl coefficient @xmath20 substituted by the energy @xmath71 , equation , and , after imposing on its eigenfunction boundary condition , arrive at the transcendental equation for the calculation of the eigenvalue @xmath66 , which , according to , defines the film temperature @xmath2 .",
    "our primary interest is an investigation of the combined influence of the extrapolation length @xmath0 and cubicity @xmath1 on the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it appears that the crucial role in this case is played also by the density @xmath3 .",
    "special attention is paid to the case of the negative de gennes distance when , as it is proved below , the increasing cubicity promotes the energy from the negative area to the positive values for one specific density @xmath3 only .",
    "critical negative extrapolation length @xmath72 at which the energy turns to zero , is calculated analytically as a function of @xmath1 and its mathematical and physical analysis is performed .",
    "the results are presented in the following outline . in , a necessary formalism applied to the study of the straight gl strip is derived along with several of its asymptotic cases some of which have been known before .",
    "results of the calculations for the positive and negative extrapolation lengths are presented separately in .",
    "the discussion is wrapped up in by some concluding remarks .",
    "consider a straight 3d infinite superconducting film of width @xmath73 .",
    "origin of the cartesian system of coordinates coincides with the middle of the film and the horizontal @xmath74 axis is perpendicular to its edges .",
    "left ( right ) confining surface is characterized by the uniform along the interface de gennes length @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "frequently used method in the study of the superconducting systems implements the scaling where the order parameter @xmath77 is expressed in units of @xmath78 and all distances are measured in units of the coherence length @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "advantage of such an approach lies in the fact that no any coefficients appear in the resulting differential gl equation and the eigenvalue transcendental relationship does contain the film width @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , shortcomings of this method are a continuation of its strong sides ; namely , by eliminating the physical parameters from the gl equation , such scaling shadows the explicit interrelations between them and at the final stage one needs to return again to the units where these quantities re - emerge what , due to the quite complicated structure of the derived dependencies , is not an easy task to do @xcite . for example , in this approach the parameter @xmath1 is dropped out from the integration constants of the gl equation and , accordingly , it is not clear how to explicitly obtain the influence of its magnitude on the properties of the superconductor and to track the transformation from the linear to the cubic scenario .",
    "since in the present research we are interested in the temperature dependence on , among other parameters , the cubicity @xmath1 , we employ the scaling where the distances are measured in units of the film width @xmath73 , which is the only natural ( temperature independent ) length for the geometry under consideration . accordingly , the energy @xmath71 through which the temperature @xmath2 is expressed according to , will be measured in units of the ground state energy @xmath80 of the 1d dirichlet well of the width @xmath73 , and cubicity @xmath1 will be expressed in units of @xmath81 . in this way",
    ", the temperature @xmath2 ( via the energy @xmath71 ) and cubicity @xmath1 explicitly stay in the differential equation and enter its solution and the resulting transcendental equation what allows to directly investigate the correlations between these two parameters .    in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath68 ,",
    "the motion along each of the axes is independent from the movement along the other ones .",
    "mathematically , this separation of the transverse and two longitudinal motions in the film is expressed via the following ansatz : @xmath82 after substitution of into one arrives at the differential equation for the transverse function @xmath83 : @xmath84 the designations of the absolute values in the cubic term have been dropped out from since it is known that even in the presence of the magnetic fields a solution of the gl equations in the simply connected region can be chosen real @xcite . as we are interested in the lowest possible value of the energy that , according to , guarantees the highest attainable temperature @xmath2 , we put @xmath85 and @xmath86 equal to zero to obtain : @xmath87 second - order nonlinear differential equation is supplemented by the two boundary conditions at the film edges : @xmath88\\right|_{x=\\pm 1/2}=0.\\ ] ] below , for simplicity , we will use the same extrapolation lengths at the opposite surfaces , @xmath89 general solution to reads : @xmath90 with @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is a jacobi elliptic sine @xcite , the integration factor @xmath93 is determined by ( or , vice versa , determines ) the density @xmath3 of the cooper pairs , as it directly follows from comparison between , and , and the coefficient @xmath94 is found from the symmetry properties of the film ; namely , for the equal de gennes lengths , equation , one has either even , @xmath95 , or odd , @xmath96 , solutions .",
    "recalling properties of the elliptic functions @xcite , one immediately gets : [ coeffc1 ] @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the order parameter becomes [ solution2 ] @xmath99 with @xmath100 being another jacobi elliptic function ( we follow commonly adopted @xcite glaisher designations @xcite ) . applying boundary conditions to the transverse function @xmath83 ,",
    "one arrives at [ eigenvalueeq1 ] @xmath101 for the odd ones with @xmath102 and @xmath103 being another two major elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "these equations determine energy @xmath71 as a function of the de gennes distance @xmath0 and , through the factor @xmath104 , of the cubicity @xmath1 and parameter @xmath93 : @xmath105 .",
    "it is the aim of the next chapter to analyze these dependencies for the positive , zero and negative extrapolation lengths .",
    "since the lowest energy level determining , according to , the temperature @xmath2 of the sample , is always even , below mainly this case is discussed .",
    "it is important to state that the mathematics involved in the derivation of ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) automatically introduces another important physical parameter ; namely , it is the integration constant @xmath93 that plays , as we shall see below , a crucial role in determining temperature of the film and a square of which , as pointed out above , represents the density @xmath3 . note that the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath93 are not completely independent , as it directly follows from , and ( 27 ) ; for example , if either of them is zero , equations ( 27 ) do not depend on the second one .",
    "mathematically , this is explained by the dependence of the effective potential @xmath106 from on @xmath93 via the order parameter @xmath83 .",
    "this has a clear physical meaning too ; namely , for the linear case , @xmath107 , the density of the superconducting pairs is vanishingly small @xcite what corresponds to the coefficient @xmath93 tending to zero , @xmath108 , and , as a result , it is dropped out from ( 27 ) .",
    "below we will interchangeably operate with the factor @xmath104 or the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath93 keeping in mind that , if required , the coefficient @xmath93 , for example , for each given @xmath1 can be determined from after finding a solution @xmath71 of equations ( 27 ) . utilizing properties of the jacobi elliptic functions @xcite , it can be shown that the transformation @xmath109 leaves intact while its even counterpart changes sign of @xmath0 what means that it is sufficient to consider the unit interval @xmath110 at its right edge , equation   becomes : @xmath111 wit @xmath112 and , thus , the energy @xmath71 in this limit is expressed via the lambert @xmath113 function @xcite @xmath114 alternatively , one can use an iterative solution of diverging to infinity as @xmath115 where the number of the nested terms @xmath116 can be increased or decreased due to the desired precision .",
    "expansion also follows straightforwardly from the asymptotic properties of the lambert @xmath113 function @xcite . of course",
    ", in reality the energy grows until the temperature @xmath2 from turns to zero . in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath93 ,",
    "the leading , @xmath0-independent coefficient of can be deduced directly from : @xmath117 the corresponding order parameter tends then to the @xmath1-independent constant : @xmath118 note that at @xmath119 and very large nonlinearities , and constitute a solution of the initial normalized gl equation for the bulk superconductor when no any boundaries are present : [ special1 ] @xmath120 this means that the effective potential is so large in this limit that the confinement of the strip can not alter it .",
    "equations  ( 34 ) also show that the density with @xmath119 is a special one what will be vividly demonstrated for the negative de gennes distances , sub .    in the opposite limit of the zero @xmath104 one",
    "arrives at the equations defining energies @xmath71 in the linear regime @xcite , as expected .",
    "other analytical asymptotics of the above equations is the case of the neumann boundary condition , @xmath121 , when the ground - state energy is an identical zero for any @xmath1 and @xmath93 , as it follows directly from : @xmath122 it means that for the neumann strip the critical temperature does not depend on the cubicity of the gl equation and on the density of the superconducting carriers and is always equal to the bulk critical temperature @xmath6 . as a final remark of this section ,",
    "let us note that if one chooses as a unit of length not the strip width @xmath73 but the coherence length @xmath123 , then the changes @xmath124 in the first argument of the elliptic functions and @xmath125 in all other appearances in ( 27 ) of the parameter @xmath126 from allows one to find the critical width @xmath69 as a function of the de gennes distance @xmath0 and factor @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "however , compared to the normalization implemented by us above , the cubicity @xmath1 in such scaling does disappear from the corresponding equations since the role of the primary parameter in this case is played not by @xmath93 but directly by @xmath104 that emerges as a result of the integration of the coefficient - free gl equation @xcite @xmath127 where the tilde denotes that the order parameter is measured in units of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "here , the results of the calculations based on the theory developed in the previous section are presented and analysed from the mathematical and physical points of view .",

    "evolution of the order parameter is shown in where the panel ( a ) exhibits @xmath83 with varying the de gennes distance at the fixed @xmath132 .",
    "similar dependencies are characteristic for the other factors @xmath104 too . for the dirichlet case , @xmath45 , due to the suppression of the order parameter at the edges , the nucleation of the superconductivity takes place in the middle of the strip . growing extrapolation length allows the cooper pairs to approach the interfaces with the corresponding decrease of the slope of the order parameter in the transverse direction , and , at the large @xmath0 , the function @xmath83 almost does not depend on @xmath74 what means a uniform nucleation of the superconductivity across the film .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) of provide a comparative analysis of the influence of the factor @xmath104 on the order parameter at the two extreme values of the extrapolation length : small , @xmath45 , panel ( b ) , and very large , @xmath133 , panel ( c ) . in either case , the symmetric function @xmath83 unrestrictedly grows when @xmath104 approaches unity .",
    "however , the @xmath134-shape for the dirichlet case is much more convex as compared to the de gennes distances close to the neumann one , @xmath135 , when , as panel ( c ) demonstrates , the order parameter stays flat with its magnitude close to zero for almost all values of @xmath104 and starts to grow upwards only in the very neighbourhood of @xmath136 .",

    "it is seen that , as discussed in the previous section , for the zero value of either @xmath1 or @xmath93 the temperature does not depend on the second parameter . the energy increases and , accordingly , the temperature @xmath2 decreases with the growth of @xmath1 or / and @xmath93 for any finite de gennes distance . as stated in the introduction",

    "as stated in the previous paragraph , the cubicity plays more prominent role when the temperature decreases .",
    "a natural question arises : when does this role become so dominant that the linear theory could not be applied and its predictions are not close anymore to the results obtained from the cubic gl equation ?",
    "practical importance of this problem lies in the fact that obtaining the solution of the linear equation is , generally , much easier than its cubic counterpart . to answer this question , in panels ( b)-(d ) of the energy is plotted in terms of the extrapolation length @xmath0 and cubicity @xmath1 at several parameters @xmath93 .",
    "it is seen that for the small densities , say , @xmath139 in panel ( b ) , the energy only weakly depends on the cubicity and , accordingly , the linear theory serves as a reliable substitution of the cubic gl equation in a wide range of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this is especially true for the dirichlet case , since the energy change with the cubicity decreases for the smaller de gennes distances : @xmath140 growing density @xmath3 leads to the increase of the slope of the @xmath71-@xmath1 characteristics , as a transition from panel ( b ) to ( c ) and , subsequently , to ( d ) demonstrates . holds true but the energy difference for the different extrapolation lengths gets smaller : @xmath141 as a result , the interval of change of the coefficient @xmath1 where the solution of the cubic gl equation can be replaced by its linear counterpart without noticeable loss of precision , shrinks and becomes less dependent on the de gennes distance with growing density of the superconducting carriers @xmath3 .",

    ", the ground - state energy for @xmath129 always lies below zero .",
    "the adjacent upper state possesses negative energy too but only if the condition @xmath144 is satisfied @xcite .",

    "its limit for the small nonlinearities reads : @xmath184 this result is understandable since in the linear regime the energy for the large negative de gennes distances lies only slightly below zero @xcite and , accordingly , small effective potential is sufficient to turn it to zero and subsequently to push into the positive territory .",
    "the magnitude of the negative @xmath185 grows together with the cubicity until it reaches zero at @xmath186 where @xmath187 is @xmath188-function @xcite .",
    "vanishing @xmath189 means that all critical lengths with @xmath190 , even though mathematically correct , are unphysical ones . in other words ,",
    "the effective potential with @xmath191 ( and , of course , @xmath119 ) completely compensates an infinitely large temperature increase produced by the infinitely small negative extrapolation length .",
    "any superconducting state with @xmath190 and @xmath119 has its temperature _ always _ smaller than the critical temperature of the bulk material , @xmath192 regardless of the surface contribution . from this point of view",
    ", the cubicity @xmath1 of the gl equation as compared to the de gennes boundary is a stronger factor affecting the properties of the superconducting film ; however , as it will be shown in the next paragraph , a substantial role in this drastic energy increase is played by the de gennes distance itself .",
    "critical extrapolation length @xmath72 is shown in panel ( a ) of where the states above ( below ) the curve correspond to the temperature higher ( lower ) than @xmath6 .",
    "( a ) critical extrapolation length @xmath72 , equation , and ( b ) corresponding to it zero - energy order parameter from versus the cubicity @xmath1 . ]    it might look surprising that the _ finite _ cubicity is able to bring into the area @xmath193 the state with any vanishingly small negative @xmath0 when , at @xmath107 , its energy tends to the negative _ infinity _ , according to . for example , a comparison with the other configurations shows that the critical extrapolation length @xmath194 , which is calculated from the linear gl equation for the quantum dot or antidot in the uniform magnetic field @xmath13 , asymptotically tends to zero from below only for the intensities @xmath195 approaching infinity @xcite . to resolve this seeming paradox , one needs to analyse the form of the effective potential for the small negative de gennes distance that , in the linear case , @xmath107 , attracts the order parameter to the edges and , in this way , delivers the larger ability for the potential to repulse the cooper pairs from the walls .",
    "thus , the extrapolation length tending to zero from the left produces at nonzero cubicity two contradicting to each other effects : on the one hand , it pushes the energy downwards by localizing the order parameter at the interfaces and , on the other hand , as a consequence of the previous action , it simultaneously provides the effective potential @xmath106 , equation , with the larger ability to repel the function @xmath83 from the film edges with the corresponding increase of the energy . the smaller the magnitude of the negative de gennes distance is , the larger the negative energy becomes and the stronger localization at the surfaces is but , at the same time , just due to this stronger localization , the faster the effective potential @xmath106 grows with the small increasing @xmath1 . in other words , potential in its effort to push the energy upwards and the order parameter _",
    "away _ from the edges is actually aided by the small negative length @xmath0 that facilitates this energy growth by pulling the order parameter _ to _ the interfaces with the corresponding increase of its amplitude and in this way subjecting the function @xmath83 to the opposite influence of the effective potential .",
    "this fine interaction between the cubicity and de gennes distance results ultimately in the drawing out of the energy from any arbitrary large negative values .    concerning equation and ( a )",
    ", it is necessary to elaborate the following remark already mentioned in passing while discussing . since the jacobi elliptic functions - in particular , @xmath92 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which enter , - are doubly periodic functions of its argument @xmath196 , for each @xmath72 from ( a ) there exists a countably infinite set of its counterparts with the same value achieved at the larger cubicities @xmath1",
    "however , physically all these critical extrapolation lengths for @xmath190 are spurious ones .",
    "this can be seen , for example , from the fact that their corresponding order parameters exhibit infinite discontinuities at some points inside the film , @xmath197 . to save space , we do not plot these unphysical functions here presenting instead in panel ( b ) of an evolution of the zero - energy order parameter @xmath198 with the growing cubicity .",
    "it exhibits a smooth transformation from the flat neumann shape at @xmath107 , when , according to and , the critical extrapolation length is equal to the negative infinity , to the linear superposition of the two @xmath150-functions , equation , at @xmath191 when the critical de gennes distance tends to zero from the left . for any cubicity larger than the critical one , @xmath190 , these infinities migrate from the edges into the middle of the film turning in this way the corresponding solutions into the spurious ones .    next ,",
    "consider the cases of @xmath199 .",
    "when the integration factor @xmath93 is less than unity , @xmath180 , the corresponding solution always exists with its energy lying below zero for all cubicities . for the large nonlinear term , @xmath200 , it ceases to depend on the cubicity approaching asymptotically a solution of the equation @xmath201 that is derived from - .",
    "for the smaller densities the saturation energy ( temperature @xmath2 ) is smaller ( larger ) .",
    "corresponding order parameter is given then as : @xmath202 what means that the effective potential @xmath106 in this limit becomes @xmath1 independent : @xmath203 and it is too weak to subdue the state sufficiently enough for its temperature to lower to @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath181 the energy can not grow more than the threshold value @xmath204 defined by the cubicity and density : @xmath205 as it directly follows from and .",
    "in fact , the state ceases to exist at the energies smaller than @xmath204 since in this case contains the jacobi functions of the form @xmath206 that , similar to their trigonometric counterparts @xcite , possess infnitely many oscillations for @xmath207 . upon its growth with the cubicity , the eigenvalue of approaches one of the zeros of these oscillations and merges with it after which the two corresponding _ real _ energies transform into the two _ complex _ conjugate values .",
    "since the present research deals with the _ real _ energies and order parameters only , this merger is considered as a disappearance of the corresponding state .",
    "physically , a destruction of the superconductivity for these parameters is explained by the fact that the decreasing temperature @xmath2 can not support the fixed large density @xmath3 of the superconducting carriers with its concentration near the film interfaces .",
    "energy @xmath71 as a function of the cubicity @xmath1 for several values of the density and negative extrapolation length where the dotted curve is for @xmath208 and @xmath119 , the solid line is for @xmath209 and @xmath119 , the dashed line is for @xmath209 and @xmath210 , the dash - dotted line is for @xmath209 and @xmath211 , and two dash - dot - dotted lines are for @xmath119 and @xmath212 ( upper curve ) or @xmath213 ( lower curve ) .",
    "thin horizontal line denotes zero energy . ]    to exemplify the results obtained above , depicts energy as a function of the cubicity for several miscellaneous combinations of the negative extrapolation lengths and densities .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath180 ( dashed line ) the energy saturates with the increasing @xmath1 to its asymptotic value calculated from while for @xmath181 ( dash - dotted curve ) the state ceases to exist on its energy approach to @xmath204 .",
    "a comparison of the curves with @xmath119 and different magnitudes of the negative de gennes distances ( solid , dotted and two dash - dot - dotted lines ) vividly manifests a convergence of the zero - energy cubicity to its critical value @xmath214 from ; namely , for the large enough negative @xmath0 only the small cubicity is needed to bring the energy to zero ( dotted line in ) while for the very small magnitudes of the de gennes distance , for example , depicted by the two dash - dot - dotted lines , the energies of the corresponding states that differ by four orders of magnitudes in the liear regime , @xmath107 , cross zero at about the same @xmath1 being very close to @xmath214 . after passing zero",
    ", the energy continues to rise with its order parameter given by @xmath215 as it follows from , for the very large nonlinearities , it diverges to the infinity with @xmath216 being its principal term , and the order parameter tends to unity , equation .",
    "thus , since the concentration with @xmath119 for the large cubicities corresponds to the boundary - free situation , the state with only this density is allowed , for the negative de gennes distances , to cross the bulk critical temperature with the increasing @xmath1 .",
    "evolution with the cubicity of the order parameter @xmath83 corresponding to the solid line of is shown in .",
    "it is seen that its upward concavity decreases with the growing parameter @xmath1 until , at the very large nonlinearities , it becomes , according to , completely flat .",
    "order parameter @xmath83 as a function of the cubicity @xmath1 for @xmath209 and @xmath119 .",
    "corresponding energy is depicted by the solid line in . ]",
    "finally , we provide a very instructive comparison of the above results for the temperature @xmath2 passing through the bulk critical temperature @xmath6 with the predictions derived from where the energy @xmath71 is explicitly set to zero : @xmath217 its corresponding eigenfunction @xmath218 reads : @xmath219 then , it directly follows from the boundary condition @xmath220 that the corresponding critical extrapolation length @xmath221 is : @xmath222 a comparison with the previous derivation shows the difference between the two results ; namely , while is obtained under the strict condition that the integration factor @xmath93 is unity and cubicity @xmath1 obeys , the claim of is that the zero energy can be achieved at any arbitrary values of the positive parameters @xmath1 and @xmath93 provided that their product @xmath223 satisfies .",
    "it is easy to understand the origin of this wrong conclusion ; namely , when the energy is bluntly put to zero in , resulting equation and its solution   know nothing about the quasi - peculiarity in and its elimination by the ansatz from . equations   - , , and for the negative @xmath71 contain much more information about the temperature behaviour close to @xmath6 than their zero - energy counterparts - . due to their limited knowledge ,",
    "the latter equations erroneously advice us that the zero energy can be achieved at any magnitudes of @xmath1 and @xmath93 if the product @xmath223 obeys while in the reality the film temperature is equal to the bulk critical temperature @xmath6 for the unity factor @xmath93 only with the cubicity @xmath1 satisfying .",
    "exact solutions of the gl equation for the superconducting film with its edges subjected to the robin - type boundary condition revealed strong dependence of the temperature @xmath2 on the interaction between the de gennes distance and cubicity with , in addition , very substantial influence of the superconducting carriers density @xmath3 . depending on these parameters , a rich spectrum of the temperature @xmath2 is obtained and analysed in detail .",
    "for example , the interplay of the negative extrapolation length and nonlinearity causes the decreasing with the growing cubicity temperature @xmath2 to cross its bulk critical value at the unique carrier concentration _ only _ while for the smaller densities its stays above @xmath6 for all cubicites , and the superconductivity is destroyed by the increasing coefficient @xmath1 for the larger cooper pairs concentration .",
    "the uniqueness of this density stems from the fact that only for it the increasing cubicity transforms the solution of the gl equation for the film into the one corresponding to the bulk superconductor .",
    "there are several possible ways of varying the de gennes distance and magnitude of the nonlinear gl term .",
    "experiment suggests that the value of the extrapolation length can be controlled by the sample preparation procedure @xcite .",
    "even more promising from this point of view is its manipulation by the applied gate voltage , according to and .",
    "miscellaneous aspects of the influence of the electrostatic fields on the superconducting films have been the subject of the experimental investigations for more than fifty years @xcite ; in particular , the change of the critical temperature under nonzero @xmath49 has been observed @xcite . however , despite its long history of research , electric field effects on superconductors are still far from being understood @xcite . with regards to the cubicity @xmath1 ,",
    "the methods of its variation follow straightforwardly from definition for the pure metals @xcite and , especially , its alloy modification @xcite ; namely , different impurity doping drastically changes the mean free path @xmath36 that becomes much smaller than the coherence length @xmath224 thus leading to the substantial increase of the nonlinear influence . in addition , the range of validity of the gl theory is much wider for the dirty superconductors @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it is believed that applying the gate voltage to the films composed with the different concentration of impurities , one can experimentally observe the predicted phenomena .",
