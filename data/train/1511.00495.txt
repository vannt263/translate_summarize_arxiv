    "naturally , one can also interpret the new formalism developed here for disformal transformations as purely mathematical ; nevertheless this is already sufficient to attract attention on its own .",

    "[ contrav ] , we can define the disformal co - metric intrinsically as @xmath46    analogously to what we did before , we can define the disformal co - vector @xmath47 associated with @xmath48 by the application of a linear map @xmath49 , from which we write the disformal co - metric as @xmath50 with @xmath51 given by @xmath52 and again we have the decomposition @xmath53 similarly to the covariant disformal operator , we have four possible contra - variant disformal operators .",
    "we shall set @xmath54 to be the disformal operator for elements in @xmath55 and again prove that it is unique .",

    "we then start with these coordinate expressions and use them to prove some propositions about the disformal operator , exploring their algebraic and geometric features .      to derive a coordinate expression for the disformal operators @xmath57 and @xmath51 , let @xmath58 be a coordinate system , @xmath59 the tangent vectors associated with the coordinate lines and @xmath60 their duals .",

    "there is a canonical isomorphism between @xmath32 and @xmath74 , namely , for a given vector @xmath75 , there is a unique @xmath76 satisfying @xmath77 .",
    "since we are now dealing with a manifold endowed with two metric tensors , the above proposition becomes ambiguous when taking duals since the @xmath78dual of a disformal vector is not the @xmath79dual of the vector .",
    "this ambiguity is always present when the manifold under consideration has more than one metric tensor .",
    "therefore , it is important to make clear which metric tensor is being used when raising and lowering indexes .",

    "@xcite , it is neater and more elegant if we deal with operators instead of the group action . finally , it should be noticed that particularly interesting examples of disformal sub - groups take place when all conformal coefficients are equal to @xmath92which renders disformal metrics similar to those from the spin-2 field theory formulation , but with finite inverse metric  besides the cases in which the disformal coefficients are zero ( @xmath93 ) , coinciding with the usual conformal group .",

    "[ deformednorm ] we proposed that a disformal metric arises when we deform vectors and use the background metric .",
    "so , if we want to characterize the disformal metric in terms of a disformal operator , @xmath26 must be well - defined and @xmath5 must inherit some of its properties . recalling that there are four possible disformal operators satisfying [ deformednorm ] and that we have claimed @xmath94 is unique in a certain sense , we then state and prove the following    @xmath94 is the only disformal operator which satisfies [ deformednorm ] and the disformal group structure .",

    "the identity has order two and the only one whose square is itself is the identity ; in our case these requirements are only fulfilled by@xmath94 . therefore , the only closed composition of disformal operators holds when they are both of the form @xmath94 .",
    "the proof that it satisfies a group structure was given in the previous section .",
    "this is entirely analogous to the @xmath51 operator .",
    "a geometrical argument to rule out the other candidates for the disformal operator ( the ones with at least one negative sign ) is : because of the negative sign , they must include a reflection in the direction perpendicular to @xmath4 and/or a change in direction along with @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , whenever they are applied an even number of times , a positive sign must appear , implying that the operation is not closed .",
    "thus , this ensures that there is a unique and well - defined disformal operator characterizing the disformal metric .",
    "we have shown that given a local coordinate system @xmath44 the coordinate expression for the disformal operator @xmath26 takes the form [ coord1 ] .",
    "lowering the @xmath103 index with the background metric @xmath3 , we thus get @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 and , therefore , @xmath107 can be seen as a disformal metric tensor on @xmath0 .    using the composition law between disformal metrics ( given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath108 we obtain that the square of @xmath109 is precisely @xmath5 : @xmath110 another way to see this is by looking at the eigenvalues of @xmath111 and @xmath67 : from the definition [ def - oper ] , the eigenvalue problem associated with the operator @xmath26 is trivially solvable .",

    "the same analysis can be carried out to @xmath51 .",
    "it means that the eigenvalues of @xmath114 ( see ref .",

    "note that the existence of the tensor field @xmath26 , such that a disformal metric in eq .",
    "[ disformalmet1 ] can be written as eq .",
    "[ deformednorm ] for any fields @xmath127 , allows us to interpret the left hand side of [ deformednorm ] as a new metric tensor for @xmath0 .",

    "we believe that disformal transformations as presented above provide a unified language for deforming a background space - time metric in this scenario and can shed light on some fundamental problems there , like covariance and causality . with this in mind",

    "the formulation of rainbow gravity is a phenomenological modification of general relativity that incorporates some properties of the doubly special relativity ( dsr ) program @xcite .",
    "dsr models deform the kinematics of special relativity , modifying also the energy - momentum conservation laws and the lorentz symmetry group , by admitting an invariant energy scale associated with quantum - gravitational effects : the planck scale .",
    "the motivation behind this stems from the path used to go from galilean relativity to the special relativity , modifying the kinematic equations of the former in order to appear an invariant velocity scale .",
    "following the same lines , it is possible to deform the latter by taking into account an invariant energy scale , which is generally believed to correspond to quantum - space - time effects , and thus derive the dsr without violation of the relativity principle . for pioneering works ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and , for a broad review , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    following the prescription presented in @xcite to perform such modifications",

    "although this deformation was initially intended to take place in the minkowski space , the idea of rainbow gravity is that such mdr can be described by energy - dependent tetrad fields , which in turn produce an energy - dependent ( rainbow ) metric of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the kronecker delta , for @xmath142 .",
    "this means that space - time is deformed in the inverse way of the momentum space ( for details , see ref .",
    "the @xmath143transformation defined in [ u - map ] resembles the ones we have considered throughout this paper , for a suitable choice of the disformal operator @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , considering a time - like 1-form field @xmath144 as defining a preferred direction in space - time , this leads to the definition of energy as the projection of the four - momentum @xmath145 onto the direction of the corresponding normalized 1-form vector @xmath146 , that is @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the co - vector responsible for the disformal transformation introduces a natural time - like direction to the reference frame .",
    "thus , using the orthonormal basis @xmath148 , an immediate conclusion one can get from this analysis is that the disformal momentum assumes the form @xmath149 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are now scalar - functions depending on @xmath145 and on @xmath150 , and are linked to the rainbow functions @xmath151 and @xmath152 through eq .",

    "we stress that although this formalism seems to impose a preferred inertial frame in space - time , which would break the local canonical lorentz symmetry , in the light of a dsr formulation this is not at all the case , since a _ deformed version of the lorentz transformation is the one that preserves the local relativity principle _ : this is the main conceptual achievement of dsr . were not the existence of deformations taken into account ,",

    "therefore , the disformal light cone lies outside the undeformed one .",
    "we have shown that disformal metrics can be written in terms of a linear isomorphism acting on the tangent space and that they actually inherit the properties of what we called the disformal operator . from the reasons presented in the text ,",
    "this operator can be seen as a more fundamental quantity than the disformal metric , providing a mathematical framework for disformal transformations .",
    "we then analyze this new facet of disformal transformations in the light of the causal structure , where it gives rise to an alternative interpretation of the modified causal cones in purely algebraic terms .",
    "finally , as a direct application of the formalism developed previously , we verified that the most relevant models in rainbow gravity are perfectly described in terms of disformal transformations . in this vein , it was possible to obtain the missing covariant approach for such phenomenological theory , with a well behaved causal structure and a clear mathematical interpretation of the physical quantities involved .",
