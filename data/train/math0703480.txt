    "over the last decade constructing exotic smooth structures on closed oriented simply - connected 4-manifolds with small euler characteristics has become one of the fundamental problems in differential topology .",
    "here , `` exotic '' means that these manifolds are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to standard manifolds , whereas the `` small '' examples we focus on are the ones with either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the most recent history can be split into two periods .",
    "the first period was opened by j. park s paper @xcite which popularized the rational blowdown technique of fintushel and stern @xcite , and several constructions of small exotic manifolds relied on an artful use of rational blowdown techniques combined with improved knot surgery tricks @xcite .",
    "more recently , akhmedov s construction in @xcite triggered the hope that using building blocks with nontrivial fundamental groups could succeed in obtaining exotica on simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "these techniques were initially espoused by fintushel and stern in @xcite and later discussed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the common theme in the recent constructions ( @xcite ) that will also be discussed herein is the manipulations to kill the fundamental group .",
    "the first goal of our paper is to outline a general recipe to obtain small exotic symplectic @xmath0-manifolds and to fit _ all _ the recent constructions in @xcite in this construction scheme . in particular , we hope to make it apparent that seemingly different examples are closely related through a sequence of luttinger surgeries .",
    "the second goal is to calculate the basic classes and the seiberg - witten ( sw ) invariants of these small @xmath0-manifolds . using these calculations",
    "we show how to obtain infinite families of pairwise nondiffeomorphic manifolds in the homeomorphism type of @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , or of @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we distinguish the diffeomorphism types of these 4-manifolds by comparing their sw invariants .",
    "each of our families will have exactly one symplectic member .",
    "the nature of our constructions differ from the earlier constructions that utilized rational blowdown and knot surgery techniques in the sense that the latter essentially start with elliptic surfaces @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( which has the same euler characteristic and signature as @xmath12 ) , and obtain smaller manifolds from them , whereas our method uses very small manifolds with nontrivial fundamental groups to obtain ` bigger ' manifolds within the same range ( namely @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , for @xmath13 ) .",
    "this aspect also agrees with the terminology `` reverse engineering '' suggested for this approach in a general manner by fintushel and stern @xcite . a problem that we do not deal with here but find interesting is the comparison of examples obtained through these two approaches that run in opposite directions .",
    "we hope that the simplicity of our examples and calculations will help with this task .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a closed riemann surface of genus @xmath15 .",
    "since the universal cover of @xmath14 is contractible , @xmath14 is acyclic .",
    "it follows from the long exact homotopy sequence of a fibration that any @xmath14 bundle over @xmath16 is acyclic .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 is minimal .",
    "one new ingredient in our constructions is the following theorem of michael usher :    [ thm : usher ] let @xmath19 be the symplectic sum , where the genus @xmath20 of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is strictly positive .    *",
    "if either @xmath23 or @xmath24 contains an embedded symplectic sphere of square @xmath25 , then @xmath26 is not minimal . *",
    "if one of the summands , say @xmath27 for definiteness , admits the structure of an @xmath28-bundle over a surface of genus @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is a section of this @xmath28-bundle , then @xmath26 is minimal if and only if @xmath29 is minimal .",
    "* in all other cases , @xmath26 is minimal .    combining the above theorem with the following result",
    "gives a way to show that simply - connected symplectic sums are irreducible .",

    "we review the basics of seiberg - witten invariant ( cf .",
    "the seiberg - witten invariant of a smooth closed oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath26 is an integer valued function which is defined on the set of spin@xmath30 structures on @xmath26 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath31 has no 2-torsion , then there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of spin@xmath30 structures on @xmath26 and the set of characteristic elements of @xmath32 as follows : to each spin@xmath33 structure @xmath34 on @xmath26 corresponds a bundle of positive spinors @xmath35 over @xmath26 .",

    "we can view the _ seiberg - witten invariant _ as an integer valued function @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the poincar dual of @xmath42 .",
    "the seiberg - witten invariant @xmath43 is a diffeomorphism invariant when @xmath44 or when @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see @xcite for the @xmath47 case ) .",

    "here we outline a general construction scheme to construct simply - connected minimal symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with small euler characteristics .",

    "recall that , @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) are nonminimal , and @xmath109 ( for @xmath111 ) all have vanishing seiberg - witten invariants , unlike the minimal symplectic 4-manifolds that we produce .",
    "our approach will allow us to argue easily how all 4-manifolds obtained earlier in @xcite arise from this construction scheme , and in particular we show how seemingly different examples rely on the very same idea .",
    "the only building blocks we need are the products of two riemann surfaces .",
    "in fact , it suffices to consider multiple copies of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , since all the other product manifolds except for @xmath114 ( which we will not use here ) can be obtained by fiber summing copies of these manifolds appropriately .",

    "we first perform blow - ups and symplectic fiber sums to obtain an intermediate manifold @xmath131 . whenever a piece is blown - up",
    ", we make sure to fiber sum that piece along a symplectic surface that intersects each exceptional sphere positively at one point .",
    "this allows us to employ theorem  [ thm : usher ] to conclude that @xmath131 is minimal .",
    "we want this intermediate manifold to satisfy the following two properties :    * @xmath131 should have the same signature and euler characteristic as @xmath130 . *",
    "if @xmath132 is the rank of the maximal subspace of @xmath133 generated by homologically essential lagrangian tori , then we should have @xmath134 .",
    "moreover , we generally desire to have @xmath135 for the reasons that will become apparent below",
    ". however , surprisingly one can also handle some examples where @xmath136 is not abelian .",
    "( see for example section [ subsec:3 - 5 ] , or @xcite . )    finally , we carefully perform @xmath137 luttinger surgeries to kill @xmath136 and obtain a simply - connected symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath26 . note that these surgeries can easily be chosen to obtain a manifold with @xmath138 .",
    "however , determining the correct choice of luttinger surgeries in this last step to kill the fundamental group completely is a much more subtle problem .",
    "this last part is certainly the hardest part of our approach , at least for the ` smaller ' constructions .",
    "the reader might want to compare below the complexity of our fundamental group calculations for @xmath1 , for @xmath2 as @xmath42 gets smaller .    in order to compute and effectively kill the fundamental group of the resulting manifold @xmath26",
    ", we will do the luttinger surgeries in our building blocks as opposed to doing them in @xmath131 .",
    "this is doable , since the lagrangian tori along which we perform luttinger surgeries lie away from the symplectic surfaces that are used in any symplectic sum constructions , as well as the blow - up regions . in other words",
    ", one can change the order of these operations while paying extra attention to the @xmath139 identifications . having the @xmath139 calculations of the pieces in hand , we can use seifert - van kampen theorem repeatedly to calculate the fundamental group of our exotic candidate @xmath26 .",
    "below , we will work out some concrete examples , where we construct minimal symplectic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to @xmath1 , for @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , for @xmath142 .",
    "we hope that the reader will have a better understanding of the recipe we have given here by looking at these examples .",
    "another essential observation that is repeatedly used in our arguments below is the interpretation of some manifold pieces used in @xcite as coming from luttinger surgeries on @xmath128 , together with the description of their fundamental groups .",
    "this is proved in the appendix",
    ". a concise history of earlier constructions will be given at the beginning of each subsection .",
    "the first example of an exotic smooth structure on the elliptic surface @xmath10 , and in fact the first exotic smooth structure on any closed topological 4-manifold , was constructed by donaldson in @xcite .",
    "donaldson s example was the dolgachev surface @xmath144 .",
    "later on , friedman showed that @xmath145 contains infinitely many nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in @xcite fintushel and",
    "stern have shown that knot surgered manifolds @xmath146 give infinitely many irreducible smooth structures on @xmath10 .",
    "consider @xmath147 equipped with its product symplectic form , and denote the last two circle factors by @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "one can take the union of three symplectic surfaces @xmath150 in @xmath151 , and resolve the two double points symplectically .",
    "this yields a genus two symplectic surface in @xmath112 with self - intersection four .",
    "symplectically blowing up @xmath151 along these four intersection points and taking the proper transform , we obtain a symplectic genus two surface @xmath21 in @xmath152 .",
    "note that the inclusion induced homomorphism from @xmath153[c , d]=1 \\rangle$ ] into @xmath154=1 \\rangle$ ] maps the generators as follows : @xmath155    let us run the same steps in a second copy of @xmath151 and label every object with a prime symbol at the end .",
    "that is , @xmath156 , @xmath22 is the same symplectic genus two surface described above with @xmath139 generators @xmath157 , and finally let @xmath158 denote the generators of the @xmath159 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the symplectic fiber sum of @xmath27 and @xmath29 along @xmath21 and @xmath22 via a diffeomorphism that extends the orientation - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath160 , described by : @xmath161    the euler characteristic of @xmath26 can be computed as @xmath162 , and the novikov additivity gives the signature @xmath163 , which are exactly the euler characteristic and the signature of @xmath164 .",
    "we claim that @xmath26 is already simply - connected and thus no luttinger surgery is needed . note that @xmath165 since a meridian circle of @xmath21 bounds a punctured exceptional sphere from one of the four blowups . using seifert - van kampen theorem",
    ", we see that @xmath166=[x',y']=1,\\\\ & & x = x'y',\\ , y = ( x')^{-1},\\ , x^{-1 } = ( x')^{-1},\\ , y^{-1}= ( y')^{-1 } \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we conclude that @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "thus @xmath170 implies @xmath171 , and in turn @xmath172 .",
    "so @xmath173 .",
    "hence by freedman s classification theorem for simply - connected topological 4-manifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath26 is homeomorphic to @xmath174 .",
    "however , @xmath26 is irreducible by theorem  [ thm : hk ] , and therefore @xmath26 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath174 .",
    "the 4-manifold @xmath26 we obtained here can be shown to be the knot surgered manifold @xmath146 , where the knot @xmath175 is the trefoil ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively we could construct the above manifold in the following way .",
    "first we symplectically sum two copies of @xmath176 along @xmath21 and @xmath22 via a map that directly identifies the generators @xmath177 with @xmath157 in that order .",
    "call this symplectic 4-manifold @xmath131 and observe that while the characteristic numbers @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the same as above , this manifold has @xmath180 and @xmath133 has four additional classes that do not occur in @xmath26 .",
    "these classes are as follows .",
    "inside @xmath181 , there are cylinders @xmath182 and @xmath183 with @xmath184",
    "similiarly we obtain cylinders @xmath185 and @xmath186 in the second copy of @xmath187 .",
    "thus we can form the following internal sums in @xmath131 : @xmath188 these are all tori of self - intersection zero .",
    "let @xmath189 denote a meridian of @xmath21 , and let @xmath190 , and @xmath191 be the ` rim tori ' , where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are suitable parallel copies of the generators @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "note that @xmath194 ^ 2=[r_b]^2=[\\sigma_a]^2= [ \\sigma_b]^2=0 $ ] , and @xmath194\\cdot[\\sigma_b]=1=[r_b]\\cdot[\\sigma_a]$ ] .",
    "observe that these rim tori are in fact lagrangian .",
    "one can show that the effect of two luttinger surgeries @xmath195 and @xmath196 is the same as changing the gluing map that we have used in the symplectic sum to the gluing map @xmath197 in the first construction .",
    "this second viewpoint is the one that will fit in with our construction of an infinite family of pairwise nondiffeomorphic smooth structures in section  [ sec : infinite families ] .",
    "the first example of an exotic @xmath198 was constructed by j. park in @xcite by using rational blowdown ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the seiberg - witten invariant calculation in @xcite shows that it is irreducible . infinitely many exotic examples were later constructed by fintushel and stern in @xcite .",
    "all of their constructions use the rational blowdown technique . here",
    "we construct another irreducible symplectic @xmath0-manifold homemorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath198 using our scheme , and thus without using any rational blowdown .",

    "hence in all three examples @xmath402 has only two basic classes , and therefore by theorem  [ thm : fs infinite ] , all three families @xmath477 consist of pairwise nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to @xmath478 , @xmath456 , or @xmath479 .",
    "furthermore , as in the previous subsection , we see that each family @xmath477 consists of 4-manifolds with only one basic class , up to sign . in each family , all but one member are nonsymplectic as the only nonzero values of the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath359 are @xmath480 .",
    "finally , each exotic @xmath359 can be seen to be irreducible by a direct seiberg - witten argument as before ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now let @xmath26 denote the exotic @xmath329 that we have described in subsection  [ subsec:3 - 5 ] .",
    "recall that we blow up @xmath128 twice and fiber sum along genus two surfaces of self - intersection @xmath300 in @xmath481 and in @xmath482 .",
    "we begin by describing the surfaces that generate @xmath378 .",
    "there is a symplectic genus two surface @xmath483 of self - intersection zero in @xmath27 intersecting @xmath21 positively at one point . on the other side in @xmath304",
    "there is a symplectic torus @xmath484 of self - intersection zero , intersecting @xmath22 positively at one point .",
    "( there is also another symplectic torus orthogonal to this one , but the homology class it induces in @xmath26 can be expressed in terms of the other homology classes that we will present below . )",
    "there are also two exceptional spheres @xmath485 and @xmath486 in @xmath304 , each of which intersects @xmath22 positively at one point as well .",
    "in addition to these there are four lagrangian tori @xmath487 , @xmath488 , which come in hyperbolic pairs , and which do not intersect @xmath22 .",
    "thus these four tori are certainly contained in @xmath26 .",
    "the other four homology generators in @xmath26 are represented by the following symplectic surfaces : a genus two surface @xmath434 , a genus three surface @xmath489 , and genus two surfaces @xmath490 , @xmath392 .",
    "we have @xmath491 ^ 2 = [ g]^2 = 0 $ ] and @xmath492 ^ 2 = -1 $ ] .",
    "once again it is a straightforward calculation to show that these eight elements induce an intersection form which is isomorphic to that of @xmath329 .    the @xmath300 surgery on @xmath65 results in a 4-manifold @xmath402 satisfying @xmath493 and @xmath494 , where the new 2-dimensional homology classes are represented by two lagrangian tori @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "as we have argued in subsection  [ subsec : infinite1 - 3 ] , the homology classes @xmath497 $ ] do not appear in any basic class of @xmath402 , and neither do the other four lagrangian tori @xmath401 .",
    "thus a basic class of @xmath402 is of the form @xmath440 + b [ g ] + \\sum_i r_i [ r_i]$ ] as before .",
    "since it is a characteristic element , @xmath117 and @xmath118 should be even , and @xmath404 and @xmath405 should be odd .    the inequalities ( i)(iv ) in subsection  [ subsec : infinite1 - 3 ] now become ( due to the change in genera of the surfaces and the characteristic numbers of @xmath402 ) :    *  @xmath498 |$ ] , implying @xmath499 .",

    "*  @xmath500 |$ ] , implying @xmath501 for @xmath392 . *  @xmath502 .    from ( i )",
    ", we see that @xmath117 can only be @xmath503 .",
    "however , ( iv ) indicates that @xmath416 .",
    "let us take @xmath417 . then by ( iv ) @xmath504 , which contradicts ( ii ) . similarly if @xmath423 , we get @xmath505 , again contradicting ( ii ) .",
    "next suppose that @xmath506 .",
    "then by ( iv ) @xmath507 and so ( ii ) implies that @xmath508 .",
    "now ( iv ) implies that @xmath509 , and hence @xmath510 . by ( iii )",
    "we see that @xmath511 .",
    ". therefore we get @xmath512 + \\sum_i [ r_i]$ ] .",
    "the case when @xmath513 is similar .",
    "as before we see that @xmath510 and ( iii ) forces both @xmath420 to be equal to @xmath25 .",
    "it again follows that @xmath422 .",
    "hence @xmath50 is the negative of the class we obtained for the @xmath514 case .",
    "it follows that @xmath402 has only two basic classes @xmath515 + \\sum_i [ r_i])=\\pm   k_{x_0}$ ] , where @xmath427 is the canonical class of the symplectic manifold @xmath402 . once again by theorem  [ thm : fs infinite ] , all @xmath359 are pairwise nondiffeomorphic .",
    "so we obtain the following .",
    "there is an infinite family of pairwise nondiffeomorphic @xmath0-manifolds which are all homeomorphic to @xmath516 .",
    "all of these @xmath0-manifolds are irreducible , and they possess exactly one basic class , up to sign . all except for one are nonsymplectic .      in subsection",
    "[ subsec:3-(2l+3 ) ] we constructed irreducible symplectic exotic @xmath3 for @xmath517 by fiber summing irreducible symplectic exotic @xmath319 for @xmath518 along a genus two surface with @xmath304 or @xmath308 . for each @xmath3 for @xmath517",
    ", we will obtain an infinite family of exotic smooth structures on it , by simply using the infinite family of exotic smooth structures on @xmath319 constructed in subsections [ subsec : infinite1 - 3 ] and [ subsec : infinite1-(2k+1 ) ] .",
    "since each such infinite family was obtained by performing torus surgeries away from the genus two surface @xmath21 that we have used to fiber sum , we can fiber sum each exotic member along @xmath21 with the usual genus two surface in @xmath304 or @xmath308 .",
    "these new fiber sums are then also simply - connected , and they have the same characteristic numbers and parity as the exotic copy of @xmath3 ( @xmath517 ) that we have constructed . we claim that infinitely many of them have different seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "we will present the details of this argument for the family which is homeomorphic to @xmath519 and leave the others as an exercise for the reader since they are extremely similar .",

    "remark  [ rmk : two classes ] ) .",
    "let us denote these basic classes by @xmath522 . from ( [ eq : sw of 1 - 3 ] ) in subsection  [ subsec : infinite1 - 3 ] , we conclude that @xmath523 using the adjunction inequality and the blowup formula in @xcite , we can deduce that there are four basic classes of @xmath331 , namely @xmath524\\pm [ e_2]$ ] and @xmath525\\pm[e_2]$ ] , where @xmath526 and @xmath527 are the exceptional spheres of the blowups .",

    ", @xmath531 has to be irreducible as well .",
    "we would like to finish with two questions that naturally arise within the context of our article .",
    "is there a general construction scheme similar to the one we have outlined , which produces irreducible symplectic structures on @xmath537 or on @xmath538 ( for @xmath539 and for @xmath540 ) ?",
    "more explicitly , what would be the intermediate manifold @xmath131 , satisfying conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) in section  [ sec : general ] , if the target manifold @xmath130 is chosen as one of these manifolds ?    certainly , for @xmath541 and @xmath542 , it is currently unknown whether there are any irreducible @xmath0-manifolds in these homeomorphism classes .",
    "when @xmath543 or @xmath0 , @xcite and @xcite give irreducible symplectic structures on @xmath544 and @xcite give infinite families of pairwise nondiffeomorphic exotic smooth structures . for @xmath545 or @xmath546 , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our emphasis here is on the method , and it would be nice to construct similar examples using our recipe in section  [ sec : general ] .    on the other hand , note that remark [ the rest ] can easily be modified to obtain exotic @xmath547 for @xmath320 . for this , we first blow down one of the sphere sections in @xmath174 to get a symplectic torus @xmath548 of self - intersection @xmath326 in @xmath549 , and then fiber sum @xmath549 with an exotic copy @xmath26 of @xmath319 for @xmath320 by gluing @xmath548 to one of the symplectic tori of self - intersection @xmath25 in @xmath26 .    our next question is motivated by our @xmath550 example as well as the constructions that appear in @xcite .",
    "is it possible to determine the conditions on the fundamental group of the intermediate manifold @xmath131 , possibly with some geometric side - conditions , that allow one to kill the fundamental group through a sequence of luttinger surgeries ?",
    "let @xmath551 , where we have switched the order of the symplectic @xmath552 components @xmath553 and @xmath554 to have a comparable notation for our earlier @xmath139 calculations .",
    "let @xmath352 be an @xmath353-twist knot ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fourtorus2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath555 denote the result of performing @xmath300 dehn surgery on @xmath556 along @xmath352 .",
    "our goal here is to show that the 4-manifold @xmath557 is obtained from @xmath558 by first performing a luttinger surgery @xmath559 followed by a surgery @xmath560 . here , the tori @xmath561 and @xmath562 are lagrangian and the second tilde circle factors in @xmath563 are as pictured in figure  [ fig : cube ] .",
    "we use the lagrangian framing to trivialize their tubular neighborhoods , so when @xmath564 the second surgery is also a luttinger surgery .    ]",
    "note that the normal disks of each lagrangian tori in their weinstein neighborhoods lie completely in @xmath563 and are disjoint .",
    "thus topologically , the result of these surgeries can be seen as the product of the first @xmath565 factor with the result of dehn surgeries along @xmath192 and @xmath193 in @xmath563 .",
    "therefore we can restrict our attention to the effect of these dehn surgeries in @xmath563 since the diffeomorphisms of the @xmath9-manifolds induce diffeomorphisms between the product @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the kirby calculus diagrams in figure  [ fourtorus2 ] show that the result of these dehn surgeries is the manifold @xmath555 , where @xmath352 is ( the mirror of ) the @xmath353-twist knot .",
    "in particular , note that for @xmath564 we get the trefoil knot @xmath175 .",
    "thus the effect of @xmath560 surgery with @xmath530 as opposed to the luttinger surgery @xmath566 is equivalent to using the non - symplectic 4-manifold @xmath557 instead of symplectic @xmath567 in our symplectic sum constructions .",

    "the complement of a fiber union a section in @xmath563 is the complement of 3-dimensional shaded regions in figure  [ fig : cube ] .    ]",
    "it is not too hard to see that the lagrangian framings give the following product decompositions of two boundary 3-tori ( compare with @xcite ) : @xmath573 , \\label{eq : c x a}\\\\ \\partial(\\nu(c\\times\\tilde{b } ) ) & \\cong & c \\times b \\times [ a^{-1},d ] .",
    "\\label{eq : c x b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lagrangian pushoff of @xmath193 is represented by @xmath118 , as a homotopy to @xmath118 is given by the `` diagonal '' path ( dotted lines emanating from the horizontal boundary cylinder @xmath574 in figure  [ fig : cube ] ) . for decomposition ( [ eq : c x b ] ) , it is helpful to view the base point as the front lower right corner of the cube represented by a dot in figure  [ fig : cube ] .",
    "it is comparatively more difficult to see that the lagrangian pushoff of @xmath192 is represented by @xmath575 .",
    "the lagrangian pushoff of @xmath192 is represented by the dotted circle in figure  [ fig : cubeface ] and is seen to be homotopic to the composition @xmath576=a(a^{-1}dad^{-1})=dad^{-1}$ ] . for decomposition ( [ eq : c x a ] ) , it is helpful to view the base point as the front upper left corner of the cube represented by a dot in figure  [ fig : cube ] . the new relations in @xmath139 introduced by the two surgeries are @xmath577 = db^{-1}d^{-1}b , \\quad b = [ a^{-1},d]^n=(a^{-1}dad^{-1})^n .\\ ] ]    from now on ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath564 .",
    "then the second relation in ( [ pi_1 relations from two surgeries ] ) gives @xmath578 combining ( [ monodromy1 ] ) with the first relation in ( [ pi_1 relations from two surgeries ] ) gives @xmath579 , which can be simplified to @xmath580 .",
