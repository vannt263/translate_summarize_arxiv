    "the study of galaxy clusters encompasses almost every aspect of cosmology , from the determination of fundamental constants to the influence of the local environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "yet a solid understanding of the process of cluster evolution has remained elusive . in a hierarchical universe clusters",
    "begin to form at very high redshift , then grow and evolve through cluster merging and accretion of groups .",
    "understanding this process , which may continue to significantly lower redshifts than the original epoch of formation , and its importance in driving cluster galaxy evolution , will be a major step towards clarifying the complex physical details of hierarchical structure formation , at the level of individual objects .    by a redshift of @xmath2",
    "1 galaxy clusters show already significant differences from their local descendants , indicative of younger and more active systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in the field , much of this activity is dust enshrouded @xcite and conclusions drawn solely from optical studies are potentially misleading or at best incomplete .",
    "indeed , recent observations of moderate redshift clusters ( @xmath2 0.2 - 0.4 ) with iso at 15@xmath1 m , which directly samples hot dust , have detected dusty starburts @xcite , and it is estimated for one cluster that perhaps 90% of the star formation is dust enshrouded and undetected in optical studies @xcite .",
    "the iso results are particularly interesting since , at least for one cluster , a1689 @xcite , the fraction of dusty galaxies is greater than in the field , implying the cluster environment is somehow responsible for triggering the intense star formation .    thus far , extreme star - formation activity in clusters ( such as that seen in ultraluminous infrared galaxies [ ulirgs ] at high and low redshift ) has not been unambiguously detected ; even the systems seen by iso are limited to rates of a few tens of solar masses per year ( assuming no contribution from active galactic nuclei [ agn ] ) .",
    "the exception to this is the handful of central cd galaxies detected at 850@xmath1 m primarily during surveys for faint background sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "knudsen et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite reported an excess number of submillimeter luminous galaxies ( smgs ) , detected at 850 , in @xmath2 1 cluster fields and , based on lensing considerations , argued that they were associated with the clusters rather than a background population . if the smgs are indeed cluster members , they represent by far the most intense star bursts seen in clusters to date with rates of @xmath3100 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 . still , since none of the systems have been verified to lie at the cluster redshifts they could be background objects , perhaps lensed by the cluster potential .",
    "lensing effects have been exploited by many groups to overcome the blank - field confusion limitations and detect faint smgs ( @xmath6 2 mjy ) at high redshift @xcite ; but these surveys have employed lower redshift clusters ( @xmath7 0.5 ) , since massive , relaxed clusters at low redshift are more efficient lenses than high - redshift clusters .",
    "recent results from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , indicate that this is not always the case , and some higher redshift clusters appear to be excellent lenses .",
    "@xcite have found that the number of strong multiple optical arcs for @xmath8 0.6 clusters seen in the rcs is larger than expected .",
    "this , along with the fact that the number of arcs in other medium-/high - redshift cluster surveys are several times larger than that expected from standard @xmath9cdm cosmology @xcite , leads to the interpretation that at least at high redshift , there may be a subset of rich clusters which have much higher lensing cross - sections than predicted ( but see * ? ? ? * for an alternative explanation ) .",
    "these `` super - lenses '' could be due , for example , to an increase in cluster substructure with redshift , when clusters are observed in a younger and less relaxed state .    to examine both the issues of super - lensing and and possible excess smgs in high redshift clusters , we we have begun a survey at 850@xmath1 m of high redshift ( 0.6 @xmath10 1.1 ) galaxy clusters from the rcs with scuba on the jcmt .",
    "the survey consists of two subsamples : five which show strong optical arcs and five control clusters of similar richness and redshift , which do not . here",
    "we present the submillimeter data and follow - up imaging from a single super lensing cluster field rcsj022434 - 0002.5 ( hereafter rcs0224 ) ; the entire submm program , when complete , will be presented in a later paper ( webb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we outline the submillimeter and supplementary observations and data analysis ;  3 presents the object catalogue ; in  4 we discuss the properties of the counterparts to the submillimeter emission ;  5 contains a discussion of the results .",
    "a flat , @xmath11=0.7 universe , with @xmath12=72 km / s / mpc was assumed throughout .",
    "rcs0224 @xcite was discovered within the rcs , a 90-square degree optical imaging survey designed to find galaxy clusters up to @xmath13 1.4 .",
    "it is the most spectacular example of the rcs super lensing clusters , with two strong optical arcs originating from different background objects , one with @xmath0 = 4.9 , and a third arc was discovered in a deep hst image .",
    "subsequent spectroscopic follow - up has confirmed the cluster redshift to be @xmath13 0.773 .",
    "the cluster was simultaneously observed at 450 and 850 using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) @xcite on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) over two observing runs in 2001 and 2002 .",
    "we employed the jiggle - map mode of scuba which fills in the under - sampled sky by stepping the secondary mirror through a 64-point pattern in each nod position throughout each 128-sec integration . with ac - coupled bolometers , chopping and nodding",
    "is still required in the submillimeter for proper sky removal and we chopped in ra with a 30 chop - throw .",
    "such a small chop - throw has two advantages : it optimizes sky removal by sampling nearby sky , and the off - source chop remains on the array , creating a negative - positive - negative beam pattern that is used to improve the extraction of real sources .",
    "the map consists of two pointings , centrally offset from each other by 20 in ra and dec and roughly centered on the cluster center , as determined from the optical data .",
    "the area is approxmately 6.3arcmin@xmath14 though the depth varies with position in the map due to uneven coverage and differing bolometer sensitivities .",
    "a total integration time of 38.5ks was obtained on the center of the map , but the effective integration time is less at the edges where the sky is not evenly sampled by the array and where pointings do not overlap .",
    "the sky opacity was monitored through _ skydips _ every 1 - 2 hours and was stable throughout each individual night , ranging from @xmath15 0.1 - 0.32 throughout the two runs . pointing stability was also closely monitored : pointing observations on near - by point - sources were performed every 1.5 hours or after a major slew of the telescope .",
    "calibration maps were acquired each night and calibration factors were found to be stable to within 10% of the standard gain values at 850 .",
    "the calibration at 450 is stable to @xmath3 30% .",
    "the data reduction was complicated by the presence of a strong correlated noise signal which occurred at the jiggle - map frequency ( 16 seconds ) ( c. borys personal communication , 2004 ) .",
    "this signal appears in the 2002 data and affects between 1/3 and 2/3 of the bolometers at any given time .",
    "we reduced its effect in the following way .",
    "after the standard flat - fielding and extinction corrections , noise corrupted bolometers were identified through the presence of power in their fourier spectrum at the characteristic scale .",
    "residual sky - flux was removed from all the bolometers by subtracting the median sky level at each second , determined using only the non - corrupted bolometers . because the noise on the remaining corrupted bolometers is correlated it is possible to reduce its effect through the subtraction of this correlated signal .",
    "this was done through simple multiple linear regression techniques in which the expected noise signal in a given bolometer was predicted using all other corrupted bolometers and then removed . as a final step ,",
    "noise spikes at @xmath16 3@xmath17 were iteratively removed from all bolometers and the bolometer time - streams were rebinned to produce the final map .",
    "the removal of the correlated noise from the corrupted bolometers results in a overall reduction of the noise in the final map of @xmath18 30% .",
    "a comparison of the non - corrupted 2001 data with the corrupted data from 2002 , both corrected and non - corrected show that the presence of point sources in this map is robust , with no sources lost and no new sources introduced other than what is expected from an improved signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we note , however , that this is not the case for shallower surveys where this noise signal can lead to significant changes in the number of real and spurious sources detected @xcite .      because of strongly varying noise properties ( spatial and temporal ) , and the fact that one is generally working at the detection limit of the data , deep imaging with scuba requires careful noise analysis , to assign significance to each detection , and to minimize spurious sources . to estimate the noise as a function of position on the image we employed two related techniques .",
    "first , following the method outlined in @xcite and @xcite we generated 500 monte carlo simulations of each bolometer time - stream , assuming gaussian noise statistics , uncorrelated bolometers , and without introducing any signal .",
    "the reduction procedure was repeated on these simulated data , resulting in a set of final rebinned maps with no sources but with noise characteristics similar to the real data .",
    "a noise map is then simply the variance of the individual simulations .",
    "second , using the real bolometer time - streams we employed a bootstrap algorithm to generate a variance map from 500 realizations .",
    "the two techniques produced similar variance maps : the mean ratio between the two maps was @xmath3 1.0 , and varied by @xmath1920% over the entire field .",
    "the significance levels quoted in table [ list ] refer to the first method .",
    "source extraction was performed using an iterative cleaning technique @xcite .",
    "an initial list of source positions was produced by convolving the raw map with the beam template , which includes the off - beams produced by the chop .",
    "this technique is similar to the template fitting used by other groups , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and is advantageous over simple smoothing since it incorporates information ( position and flux ) from the two negative off - sources associated with each real source . beginning with an initial list of @xmath20 3 detections ,",
    "the map was iteratively cleaned of sources in 10% flux steps . using these cleaned results , for each source all other sources were removed from the raw , unconvolved map , and the isolated source was again convolved with the beam template .",
    "this provides improved flux densities , positions , and detection significances for each source since contamination from near - by confused sources is reduced ( see figure 1 and  3.1 )    the 450 observations , which are taken simultaneously by exploiting a dichroic beam splitter , suffer from a greatly increased sky opacity and a very unstable beam , and are therefore much more difficult to work with . instead of generating a separate source catalog from the 450 data we simply searched for 450 emission from the previously detected 850 sources .",
    "we adopted a search radius of 10 around each 850 position , allowing for a combination of the expected positional uncertainties at both wavelengths and we take as the flux measurement the nearest 450 peak above 2.5@xmath17 within this radius .",
    "approximately 5 hours of data were obtained on each of three days during december 2003 using the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very large array in b configuration , exploiting a pseudo - continuum correlator mode to minimize bandwidth smearing .",
    "data were recorded every 5 seconds in 3.25-mhz channels , 28 in total , centered at 1.4ghz , taking both left - circular and right - circular polarizations .",
    "0137 + 331 was used for flux calibration and 0239 + 42 ( 0.72jy ) was observed every hour for local phase / amplitude / bandpass calibration .",
    "initial calibration and mapping were performed using standard aips tasks .",
    "the initial calibration was good on most baselines , though we were able to improve the fidelity of the final image by running a series of self - calibration / imaging tasks , with a model comprising the central 820@xmath21 @xmath22 820@xmath21 field plus 11 non - contiguous fields containing bright sources .",
    "the final image has a series of north - south stripes near the brightest sources , typical of equatorial fields , but in clean regions of the map the noise is around 15@xmath1jybeam@xmath5 , where the beam is near - circular with fwhm @xmath3 4.5@xmath21 .",
    "multi - filter optical images of the field are available from various sources . the original discovery data from the rcs provide data in @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the cfht12k camera @xcite .",
    "additional images in @xmath25 and @xmath26 have been obtained , also with the cfht12k , as part of the four - color photometry follow - up of the cfht part of the rcs survey .",
    "the details of the observations and photometric reduction techniques are provided in @xcite for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 data , and in @xcite for the v and b images .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28-band images of the central @xmath182@xmath292@xmath30 were obtained using the panic camera @xcite on the magellan baade 6.5 m telescope .",
    "panic is a 1024@xmath221024 pixel near - ir camera with a pixel scale of 0.125@xmath21 per pixel .",
    "integrations totalling 54 min in @xmath28 were obtained on 21/12/2003 and 52 min in @xmath27 on 24/10/2004 , both under moderately good seeing and photometric conditions .",
    "object finding and photometry in the @xmath28 image were performed using the program ppp ( yee 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 colors were measured using identical angular aperture sizes based on the magnitude growth curve ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "@xmath32 colors , discussed in  5 , were measured for the two brightest smgs in a similar manner .",
    "the 850 map is shown in figure [ map ] and the detected sources are listed in table [ list ] .",
    "we detect five smgs at 850 above @xmath33 3.0 . because the use of chopping to remove the sky level results in a map with a mean flux level of zero , the noise will be symmetric around zero and and the number of spurious sources on a scuba map may be estimated through the number of sources detected in an inverted map .",
    "after first removing all positive sources and their associated negative off - sources , we searched for negative sources at @xmath16 3.0 @xmath17 level on the inverted map .",
    "only one negative source was found , at 3.0@xmath17 near the northern edge of the map , indicating our source list is reliable at this level .    to quantify the uncertainties in the submillimeter position and flux measurement we placed and recovered point sources of varying flux levels and positions into the image .",
    "working with the real map will produce more realistic results than working with the simulated data , since the effects of confusion are included through the presence of the unresolved background . in order to avoid over - estimating the effects of confusion the five bright real sources ( i.e.",
    ", s / n @xmath16 3 ) were removed from the map before this analysis . given our small field size and the high number of sources the addition of even a single object leads to an unrealistically large source density .",
    "on the other hand , removing all the detected sources will lead to an underestimate of the positional uncertainties , since only confusion with sources below the confusion limit is considered .",
    "the 95th percentiles for the positional offsets for s / n of 3.5@xmath17 , 4.5@xmath17 , 5.5@xmath17 , and 6.5@xmath17 are 9.2 , 8.4 , 7.6 , and 7.6 respectively . the distributions in each bin",
    "are all centered at @xmath3 4.5 and skewed strongly to larger offsets , particularly in the lowest s / n bins .",
    "we note that these offsets are in good agreement with @xcite who find a positional accuracy ( 1@xmath17 ) of 1.5@xmath22fwhm / snr for 5@xmath17 sources , determined from the distribution of offsets from the objects to radio positions .",
    "the error on the flux measurement may be estimated from the signal - to - noise map , or through a comparison of the input flux to recovered flux in the simulations described above ( more correctly , from the output flux to the range in input fluxes which produce such a measured flux ) .",
    "it was found that these two methods compared well , indicating that the monte carlo simulations reasonably reproduce the noise statistics of the data .    in figure [ map](b ) we show the 450 flux contours , overlaid on the 850 map , and a correlation between the two wavelengths is apparent .",
    "four of the five 850 sources have usable 450 coverage ( the southern - most 850@xmath1 m source lies in the unreliable edge region of the 450 map ) .",
    "three of these are detected at 450@xmath1 m with @xmath34 3.0@xmath17 , and the fourth with 2.5@xmath17 . using the 450 number density on the map at these levels of significance we can estimate the probability that a 450 detection is randomly aligned within 10 of an 850 source .",
    "for the 450 sources with s / n@xmath34 3 this probabilty is 8% , while the single s / n = 2.5@xmath17 has a probability of 16% . given the actual measured offsets ( which , barring one , are @xmath35 6 ) , the probability of chance alignments for all four sources is @xmath19 6% .",
    "thus , for these four sources we would expect less than one chance alignment and regard the 450 detections as reliable counterparts to the 850@xmath1 m emission .",
    "the detection of these four objects in both submillimeter bands is strong evidence that they are real and not spurious detections .    in principle , because of the smaller beam size , the 450 detection should provide a better measure of the true source position than at 850 ; in practice , the poorer quality of the 450 data does not make this so .",
    "simulations of the positional uncertainty at 450 , similar to those discussed above for 850 , indicate that at @xmath35 4@xmath17 ( the significance of these detections ) the median positional uncertainty is roughly equal to that at 850 but with higher dispersion and skewed heavily to large offsets ( the 95% percentile is @xmath3 13 ) .",

    "interestingly , the source counts are similar to those from other cluster surveys of @xcite and @xcite which also lie systematically above the blank - field counts at at least the 1@xmath17 level ( the exception to this is @xcite which is also a cluster program ) . the smail et al",
    ".  counts do not include two cluster members ( cd galaxies ) and have been corrected for lensing which can be substantial for low redshift clusters , whereas the higher redshift cluster fields of best ( and rcs0224 ) suffer a significantly lower average lensing magnification (  3.2 ) . while the offset from the blank - field is small for each survey , taken together",
    ", these results suggest that source counts in cluster fields ( at all redshifts ) are enhanced , possibily due to cluster member contamination .",
    "this has been noted previously by @xcite .",
    "the full rcs submillimeter survey will increase the statistics on cluster field counts , in particular at higher redshifts where the enhancement may be more pronounced , due to younger clusters and hierarchical processes ( discussed below ) .      although the rcs0224 cumulate source counts are consistent with the blank - field measurements , this in itself is not unambiguous evidence that all five smgs are background systems ; however , taken with our simple but adequate mass model (  3.2 ) , it does indicates that none of these systems are substantially lensed .",
    "because of the scatter in the blank field source counts and the small area surveyed here , a scenario where some ( but not all ) of the smgs are cluster members easily remains in - line with the expected source counts .    the strongest evidence that some of the smgs presented here are cluster galaxies are the optical photometric redshifts of two of the radio - detected smgs , smm - rcs0224.1 and smm - rcs0224.2 , which are in excellent agreement with the cluster redshift ( table [ radio ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the optical photometric redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath49 0.1 ) are substantially lower than for the radio - submm redshift estimate ( @xmath501.0 ) ; for this reason whilst the radio - submm redshift estimates are discussed below we give them much less weight than the optical photometric redshifts for these two galaxies .",
    "the near - infrared counterparts of smm - rcs0224.1 and smm - rcs0224.2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ids2 ] and have colours and magnitudes ( @xmath51 ; see table [ radio ] ) suggestive of low - redshift objects .",
    "their @xmath52 colours are consistent with both the cluster red - sequence at this redshift , @xmath53 = 4.7 @xcite , as well as dusty star - bursts and radio galaxies at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared color of smm - rcs0224.1 is quite blue with @xmath55=1.1 , similar to other @xmath56 radio galaxies ( which this source cleary is with @xmath57 = 1.6mjy ) , and possibly indicating substantial h@xmath58 and neii contamination of the @xmath27-band flux .",
    "source smm - rcs0224.2 has @xmath59 , which if at @xmath60 ( the photometric redshift and cluster redshift ) suggests a dusty starburst , rather than an early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "the remaining two radio - detected smgs are much fainter in the optical bands and thus do not have sufficient detections for phototmetric redshifts ; however , the radio identification allows us to examine the @xmath31 colors ( our @xmath27 imaging is too shallow for @xmath61 ) .",
    "source smm - rcs0224.3 is very faint ( @xmath62 ) with an extremely red color of at least @xmath63 .",
    "this is consistent with a high - redshift @xmath64 galaxy and indeed with the counterparts of the @xmath65 blank - field smgs which are often faint and red .",
    "source smm - rcs0224.5 however , has a more moderate @xmath31 color similar to smm - rcs0224.1 and smm - rcs0224.2 .",
    "redshifts estimated from radio - submm spectral indices have substantial uncertainties ( @xmath46 1 ) and provide much poorer redshift constraints than the photometric redshifts . nevertheless ,",
    "since this is a frequently applied technique in the absence of spectroscopy , we discuss such estimates here .",
    "this method implies an unphysical redshift of @xmath66 for smm - rcs0224.1 which is almost certainly due to the agn contribution to the radio flux , in addition to the usual uncertainties .",
    "two sources , smm - rcs0224.3 and smm - rcs0224.5 have measured ratios which are consistent with @xmath67 1 objects .",
    "as discussed above , however , the optical / nir properties of smm - rcs0224.3 do not support cluster membership but rather are similar to the background smg population .",
    "source smm - rcs0224.5 on the other hand has a more moderate color and thus , while not ruling out a background source , is in general agreement with the radio estimate .",
    "the radio - to - submm redshift estimate of smm - rcs0224.2 is @xmath0 = 1.9 , substantially higher than the optical / nir estimate and while the radio - submm estimate is uncertain this raises the interesting possiblitity that the radio - submm galaxy and the optical counterpart may represent different galaxies , as there is a small offset ( @xmath3 1 arcsec ) between the radio and optical positions .    in principle the 450@xmath40 - 850@xmath1 m flux ratios",
    "may also be used to isloate low - redshift smgs but the large uncertainties on the 450@xmath40 flux measurement and the flatness of the observed ratio with redshift out to @xmath68 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes this method of little use in our case .",
    "three of the four 450@xmath40 detected smgs are consistent with essentially all redshifts below @xmath69 , given a reasonable thermal spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the fourth source , the strong radio source smm - rcs0224.1 , has a ratio which appears to place it at @xmath70 ; however in this case it is likely the 850@xmath40 flux is also boosted by the agn , though to a lesser extent than the radio flux , and therefore the 450@xmath40 - 850@xmath40 flux ratio can not be described by a simple thermal sed .    to summarize , sources smm - rcs0224.1 , smm - rcs0224.2 are likely cluster members , based on their optical photometric redshifts , @xmath71 magnitudes and optical / nir colors .",
    "sources smm - rcs0224.3 and smm - rcs0224.4 are more consistent with belonging to the background population of smgs , though they are not highly lensed by the cluster .",
    "very little constraint can be placed on the redshift of smm - rcs0224.5 ; there are not enough data for an optical photometric redshift estimate and while its radio - submillimeter ratio suggests a @xmath67 1 galaxy , there is substantial uncertainty in this technique , as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ redshift ] .",
    "spectroscopic redshift measurements are clearly required to resolve this issue , as well as improved positional information for the smgs with large offsets to their radio identifications .",
    "the latter is particularly important to rule out the possibility of single galaxy , or cluster - substructure , lensing .",
    "if two of the smgs in the rcs0224 field are indeed dusty starbursts and/or agn within the cluster this has interesting implications for the evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "thus far , star formation rates and dust levels great enough to produce strong enough submillimeter emission to be seen by scuba ( @xmath3100 m@xmath72 yr@xmath5 , but very dependent on temperature ) have not been unambigously detected in clusters .",
    "this could , in part , be a selection effect : in addition to the fact that very few high redshift galaxy clusters have been searched for star formation , such objects may be so obscured that they go unrecognized in optical studies , as was the case in the field until recently .",
    "submillimeter surveys are sensitive to much colder dust than mid - ir observations with iso , and thus may detect fundamentally different objects .",
    "in fact , a deep scuba image has been obtained for a1689 but none of the iso sources are coincident with the 850@xmath1m - selected objects ( knudsen et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we can estimate the star formation rate such systems would have if they lie at @xmath13 0.773 through an extrapolation from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and using the relation of @xcite .",
    "we adopt a temperature of 40k and dust emissivity @xmath75 = 1.3 @xcite . ignoring smm - rcs0224.1 , which is likely agn - dominated",
    ", we find a range in star formation rates of @xmath3 250 - 430 m@xmath72 yr@xmath5 , for our range in 850 flux levels .",
    "we note , however , that this estimate is highly dependent on temperature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion ) and varying the dust temperature from 30 - 50k ( a relatively modest range ) results in sfr estimates from 90 - 900m@xmath72 yr@xmath5 .",
    "we note that both of the clusters in the literature with substantial 15@xmath1 m emission @xcite show signs of recent or ongoing cluster mergers , as do many of the clusters with excess radio sources at high redshift and within the local universe @xcite .",
    "currently there is no evidence that rcs0224 is undergoing a merger or large accretion , other than a shallow x - ray map showing hints of substructure @xcite , but this is simply a reflection of the limited amount of data acquired for this cluster so far .",
    "interestingly , an increase in cluster merging at @xmath2 1 also provides an explanation for the super - lensing phenomena , of which rcs0224 is an example .",
    "@xcite show that during a merger the lensing cross - section of a cluster is temporarily enhanced to such a degree that this process can account for the excess multiple arcs seen in optical surveys . in such a picture , the presence of strong optical arcs may mark merging clusters in which we may also find enhanced star formation and agn activity .",
    "we are undertaking an 850 imaging survey of z@xmath31 galaxy clusters selected from the red - sequence cluster survey . here",
    "we present the submillimeter data on the first completed cluster , rcs0224 , and follow - up imaging for counterpart determination .",
    "we detect five smgs within the field which our mass model shows are not strongly lensed , and measure cumulative number counts that are in general agreement with that expected from other blank - field surveys .",
    "interstingly , this field and two of the three other cluster surveys lie systematically above the blank - field counts , all at roughly 1@xmath17 , and taken together suggest that smg counts in cluster fields may be enhanced by unrecognized submillimeter luminous cluster members",
    ". a larger sample of clusters will provide tighter statistics .",
    "all five smgs in the rcs0224 field are detected at 1.4ghz or 450 , or both , and we have located nir counterparts for all the radio detections . based on accurate optical photometric redshifts , and magnitude and color considerations , we find that two of the five smgs ( smm - rcs0224.1 , smm - rcs0224.2 ) are consistent with being cluster member while another two objects are more likely background objects .",
    "the redshift of the last source ( smm - rcs0224.5 ) is poorly constrained ; while its radio - submillimeter flux ratio is consistent with the cluster redshift the large uncertainty in this technique makes this measurement unreliable .",
    "further data , such as spectroscopic redshifts and improved submillimeter positions , will verify this picture .",
