    "after the discovery of the higgs - like boson at the lhc @xcite the understanding of its precise role in electroweak symmetry breaking has become the prime topic in particle physics . a general approach , independent of any specific high - energy model , is provided by the effective field - theory ( eft ) method .",
    "the motivation for using eft is reinforced by the absence ( so far ) of evidence for new particles below the tev energy scale .",
    "to be fully general and to account for the possibility of higgs compositeness , the electroweak chiral lagrangian  @xcite including a light higgs  @xcite should be employed .    a widely used effective description of a light ( pseudo - goldstone ) composite higgs particle is the lagrangian of the strongly - interacting light higgs ( silh ) @xcite .",
    "by definition , this low - energy lagrangian is constructed under the additional assumption that the electroweak scale @xmath1 is parametrically smaller than the corresponding scale of the strong dynamics @xmath2 , and the lagrangian is restricted to terms of at most first order in @xmath0 . for clarity",
    "we will therefore define the term _ silh lagrangian _ as the effective theory of a light composite higgs particle through linear order in @xmath3 . without this restriction",
    ", we will use the expression _ electroweak chiral lagrangian _ instead .    as will be explained in detail below ,",
    "the usual derivation of the silh lagrangian appears unsatisfactory .",
    "an important point is that the power - counting rules postulated in @xcite are based on naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite , which are not valid in general @xcite in their usual formulation . as a consequence , the counting rules of @xcite are not fully consistent and lead to ambiguities in the estimate of the lagrangian coefficients .",
    "a systematic derivation of the silh lagrangian can be given starting from the electroweak chiral lagrangian with a light higgs .",
    "this derivation is the main subject of this paper .",
    "in addition to providing a complete silh - type lagrangian , we elaborate on further conceptual issues of relevance to phenomenology . although we agree with many results incorporated in the traditional silh lagrangian , we find some notable differences , which we discuss .",
    "some of the differences between the traditional formulation and the present approach may be seen as reflecting two different perspectives on effective field theory , which we might refer to as the ` top - down ' and the ` bottom - up ' point of view @xcite . on the one hand , in the top - down applications",
    ", effective field theory can be used to construct a low - energy approximation of a given theory , or a certain class of theories , at high energies .",
    "a typical example is the derivation of low - energy effective lagrangians for the weak interactions of the standard model ( sm ) , or one of its extensions . in this case",
    "the high - energy theory is known and the eft is used as a systematic tool to simplify the theory in the energy regime of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "following the bottom - up approach , a low - energy eft can be constructed from the relevant light degrees of freedom , based on the appropriate symmetries and a consistent power counting , without specifying any details of the high - energy completion .",
    "an example is the chiral perturbation theory of pions , where the theory at high energies , qcd , is known in principle , but the nonperturbative hadronic dynamics makes it intractable in practice .",
    "another example is the renormalizable standard model itself , which can be extended by operators of higher dimension to account in full generality for the unknown physics in the uv .",
    "even though a top - down construction may capture most of the essential features in the low - energy lagrangian , it is clear that only the bottom - up framework will guarantee a fully general eft .",
    "we emphasize that our starting point , the electroweak chiral lagrangian , is formulated as a bottom - up eft in this sense , whereas the traditional silh lagrangian might be rather considered as following a top - down approach with a class of composite higgs models in mind . in this work",
    "we will show how the silh lagrangian can be consistently derived from a model - independent bottom - up perspective .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : csilh ] we revisit the original silh lagrangian as given in  @xcite and discuss a number of issues related to its power counting .",
    "section  [ sec : lchxi ] outlines the systematics of the electroweak chiral lagrangian in the limit of small @xmath3 and clarifies the connection between a dimensional expansion ( in powers of @xmath3 ) and the chiral expansion ( in the number of loops ) . in section  [ sec : silh ]",
    "we derive the silh lagrangian , identified as the @xmath13 expansion of the electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "comments on custodial symmetry and its breaking through spurions are given in section  [ sec : custodial ] .",
    "as a concrete illustration , in section  [ sec : so5nlo ] we discuss the basis of bosonic nlo operators for the @xmath7 model .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] while technical details are collected in an appendix .",
    "the construction of the electroweak chiral lagrangian as an eft requires a power - counting prescription in order to be well defined . as discussed in  @xcite , the electroweak chiral lagrangian mixes weakly - coupled and strongly - coupled interactions , which in isolation have a very different power counting .",
    "the strategy followed in  @xcite was to define a power counting such that nlo counterterms account for all the ( superficial ) divergences coming from the one - loop diagrams built from the leading - order lagrangian .",
    "such a power counting is thus based on the infrared structure of the theory and in this sense it is the most general one . in particular",
    ", it allows us to identify the natural size of the coefficients associated with each order in the eft expansion .",
    "let us briefly summarize the basic assumptions and properties of this framework .",
    "* the goldstone bosons of electroweak symmetry breaking and the light higgs are treated , in general , as part of a new strong dynamics , to which they are coupled with a strength of @xmath14 .",
    "the scale of the new dynamics is given by the goldstone - boson decay constant @xmath2 .",
    "* the transverse gauge bosons and the fermions of the standard model are weakly coupled among themselves and to the strong sector , that is with couplings of @xmath15 . *",
    "the general effective theory for the light fields mentioned above ( the fields of the sm ) is an electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "this theory is nonrenormalizable and is valid below a cut - off are present , the chiral lagrangian with sm fields will only be valid up to this scale @xmath2 . ]",
    "the terms in the lagrangian are organized as a loop expansion , which is equivalent to a counting of terms according to their chiral dimension @xcite .",
    "the assignment of chiral dimensions to fields and couplings is @xmath17 for higgs , goldstone and gauge fields , @xmath18 for fermions , and @xmath19 for derivatives and weak couplings ( gauge or yukawa ) . * in full generality",
    ", the electroweak scale @xmath1 and the scale @xmath2 can be taken to be of the same order , @xmath20 .",
    "an expansion in @xmath3 can be performed for @xmath21 . in this case",
    "a counting by canonical dimension is recovered .",
    "the new dynamics decouples in the limit @xmath22 .    knowledge or partial knowledge of non - infrared physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , extra symmetries or additional particle content around or beyond the cutoff @xmath16 , refine the power - counting estimate and allow for additional information on the size of the operator coefficients .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that incorporating uv information goes beyond the eft power counting and introduces some degree of model dependence .",
    "the traditional silh lagrangian @xcite is constructed by assuming a set of ( infrared ) power - counting rules based on nda  @xcite supplemented with information on the uv completion .",
    "specifically , the uv completion is assumed to contain a heavy vector with @xmath23 , implemented as a gauge field of some hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite .",
    "the nda rules for operator building in @xcite are only defined relative to the leading - order ( sm ) lagrangian , rather than in an absolute sense , and read : ( i ) extra powers of the higgs doublet @xmath24 receive a suppression by @xmath25 ; ( ii ) sm gauge fields and derivatives receive a @xmath26 suppression .    with these assumptions , the nlo lagrangian is written as  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the trace .",
    "the first two lines collect the operators that are sensitive to the breaking scale @xmath2 , whereas the remaining lines gather operators generated either by tree - level resonance exchange or at one loop .    if one is aiming at a general description of strongly - coupled ewsb scenarios , the previous setting is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons .",
    "the first one is the absence of fermionic operators , which were recently included in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus instead on issues that mostly affect the foundations and systematics of the silh construction .",
    "the need for a more systematic power counting can be seen from the fact that the nda rules given in  @xcite lead to ambiguities . as a simple example , consider the nlo operator @xmath29 .",
    "this operator could be built by either ( i ) applying the first rule to the gauge kinetic term ; ( ii ) applying the second rule to the higgs potential ; or ( iii ) applying the second rule to the higgs kinetic term .",
    "the size of the corresponding coefficient would be , respectively , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the right counting is the latter , which follows without ambiguities from the rules given in  @xcite .",
    "another example is given by the operator @xmath33 , which corresponds to the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "it can be built with rule ( i ) applied to the higgs kinetic term or with rule ( ii ) applied to the higgs quartic interaction .",
    "the size of the coefficients would then be of @xmath30 or @xmath32 , respectively . in this case ,",
    "additional dynamical assumptions are needed to decide between the different possibilities . a more detailed discussion of this operator is given at the end of section [ sec : silh ] .",
    "( [ silh ] ) is to describe a consistent eft , then the scales @xmath35 may all be identified for the purpose of power counting : numerical differences in the size of the coefficients are expressed in any case through differences in the @xmath15 parameters @xmath36 .",
    "this follows from rather general principles : unless @xmath37 , the naturalness of the eft would be upset .",
    "this is actually one of the conditions to have a natural and predictive strongly - coupled eft ( like chiral perturbation theory ) .",
    "based on the previous point , it is apparent that the distinction between tree - level ( @xmath38 ) _ vs. _ loop - suppressed operators ( @xmath39 ) turns out to be of little numerical relevance .",
    "however , such a classification is also parametrically misleading : which operators can be generated at tree level and which at one loop mostly depends on the uv completion one adopts .",
    "this point has already been discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the pattern displayed in ( [ silh ] ) is specific for a uv scenario with vector mesons implemented _  la _",
    "hls  @xcite . however , there is no compelling reason why such a pattern should be expected .",
    "the best counterexample is provided by qcd itself at low energies ( see  @xcite for similar considerations ) . within the chiral expansion",
    ", the nlo operators that involve gauge fields can be written as @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 are generic ( non - abelian ) external sources . since qcd has a global @xmath42 symmetry broken down to @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . however , for comparison purposes , it is useful to formally distinguish the left- and right - handed parts . by inspection one can then see that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are in correspondence with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in turn ,",
    "can be rewritten as linear combinations of the previous operators and , additionally , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "schematically , @xmath58 in qcd , all the previous operators are experimentally of the same order @xmath59 , they all can be generated by tree - level resonance exchange , and they all are @xmath60 , with no combinations of them being suppressed , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 @xcite . therefore",
    ", qcd does not follow the uv pattern assumed in  @xcite .",
    "a point of phenomenological relevance is the spurion suppression associated with @xmath29 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "this issue is closely related to shift symmetry and its breaking , and will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : so5nlo ] .",
    "the main conclusion is that such a suppression is not present in general .    to summarize , the operators collected in  ( [ silh ] ) have a simple counting in terms of the breaking scale @xmath2 and the cutoff scale @xmath65 and fall into four main classes :    * the first line is suppressed only by @xmath66 , which in the electroweak chiral lagrangian corresponds to lo operators .",
    "* the second line ( @xmath34-parameter ) is superficially of order @xmath66 .",
    "if custodial symmetry is weakly broken , as it is usually assumed , the actual coefficient comes with an extra suppression by @xmath67 . * the last line ,",
    "as it stands , would correspond to nnlo operators , since effectively they are two - loop suppressed , @xmath68 . *",
    "the remaining operators carry a @xmath69 suppression . in the electroweak chiral lagrangian",
    "they appear as nlo operators , and as such they are generated by lo loop diagrams as well as tree - level resonance exchange , in analogy with what happens in qcd .",
    "the additional @xmath63 and @xmath64 factor suppression in @xmath70 and @xmath71 is not present in a model - independent way .    in the following sections we will substantiate these statements by deriving the silh lagrangian as a limiting case of the more general electroweak chiral lagrangian",
    "we will next outline the systematics of the effective theory for standard - model particles with strong dynamics in the higgs sector .",
    "the basic assumptions for the fields and their couplings have been summarized at the beginning of section  [ sec : csilh ] .",
    "the framework is very general and can be applied to different scenarios .",
    "when the appropriate limits are taken , it covers technicolor - like theories , composite - higgs models , or models with weakly - coupled uv completions . to be specific ,",
    "we will focus on theories with a pseudo - goldstone higgs . in this case",
    "we can typically distinguish three relevant energy scales : the electroweak scale @xmath1 , the scale @xmath2 of the symmetry breaking that leads to the goldstone bosons , and the scale @xmath16 , where the low - energy description of this dynamics is cut off .",
    "the three scales imply two possible expansion parameters , @xmath72 and the loop factor @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting picture is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdim ] , where we plot the powers of @xmath3 on the vertical axis and the loop order on the horizontal .",
    "the dots indicate , schematically , ( classes of ) operators in the effective lagrangian or , alternatively , terms in a physical amplitude .    without expanding in @xmath3 ,",
    "the effective theory takes the form of a loop expansion as in the usual chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "this amounts to proceeding from left to right in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdim ] , order by order in the loop expansion , resumming at each order all terms along the vertical axis .",
    "alternatively , the expansion may be organized in powers of @xmath3 , proceeding from bottom to top of fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdim ] and including , in principle , at each power of @xmath3 terms of arbitrary order in the loop expansion .",
    "this scheme corresponds to the conventional expansion of the effective theory in terms of the canonical dimension @xmath74 of operators , where the power of @xmath3 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "since the dimensional expansion requires only a hierarchy between @xmath1 and the new - physics scale @xmath2 , @xmath21 , it is not restricted to the pseudo - goldstone higgs scenarios we are focussing on here .",
    "we emphasize that these observations clarify the relation between an effective theory organized by canonical dimension and the electroweak chiral lagrangian organized as a loop expansion : the former is constructed row by row , the latter column by column from the terms in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdim ] .",
    "we now return specifically to the pseudo - goldstone higgs scenario with a hierarchy between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the higgs sector is assumed to be governed by strong dynamics .",
    "its effective description at scale @xmath2 is then organized in terms of a loop expansion .",
    "the electroweak effective lagrangian at scale @xmath1 is further obtained by integrating out the physics at @xmath2 , which amounts to a dimensional expansion in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath3 is small enough for this expansion to be meaningful is not much smaller than @xmath2 , the @xmath3-expansion can not be performed .",
    "the resulting eft is a chiral lagrangian at scale @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", if new particles with mass of order @xmath2 should exist , they would have to be included as additional fields in the eft .",
    "this is of course possible , but it would go beyond our initial assumption of a standard - model particle content . ] , the effective theory at @xmath1 can be considered as a _",
    "double expansion _ in the number of loops and in powers of @xmath3 . put differently",
    ", the expansion is governed simultaneously by chiral and canonical dimensions .",
    "nominally taking @xmath3 and @xmath76 to be of the same order , the effective theory for a pseudo - goldstone higgs sector then becomes an expansion organized as indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdim ] .",
    "we note that the conventional silh lagrangian @xcite has been defined as a dimensional expansion up to first order in @xmath3 , with a further scaling of the coefficients of dimension-6 operators either as @xmath66 or @xmath77 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : csilh ] , the latter scaling essentially reproduces the weighting implied by the loop expansion .",
    "however , at second order in the double expansion only terms of order @xmath5 are retained .",
    "the terms of order @xmath4 are not included in silh , which is not justified as long as @xmath3 is at least of order @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , one typically has @xmath78 , in which case @xmath4 is actually more important than @xmath5 .",
    "this holds in spite of the fact that @xmath4 terms correspond to operators of canonical dimension 8 .",
    "such a behaviour may seem unexpected from the point of view of an effective theory organized primarily in terms of canonical dimensions .",
    "it can be understood , however , as a natural consequence of the power counting based on chiral dimensions underlying the eft of a strongly - coupled sector .",
    "we remark that the terms of order @xmath4 might be included in the conventional silh lagrangian by adding the appropriate operators of dimension 8 ( and leading chiral dimension ) .",
    "alternatively , we may simply choose to work throughout with the electroweak chiral lagrangian , which automatically includes a resummation to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we emphasize again the very general nature of the complete electroweak chiral lagrangian with a light higgs as presented in  @xcite . there",
    "the higgs boson is simply described as an electroweak singlet , coupled to the nonlinearly realized electroweak goldstone bosons and the remaining sm fields . while this covers scenarios where the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson from an extended symmetry , it is not restricted to them .",
    "the higgs particle might e.g. be a dilaton , or just an ad - hoc singlet , even though this appears unattractive theoretically . in any case , the chiral lagrangian framework will allow for experimental tests with the minimum amount of theoretical bias .",
    "while efts of weakly - coupled dynamics are dimensional expansions in powers of @xmath79 , efts of strongly - coupled dynamics are intrinsically loop expansions . as a result , they are expansions in @xmath80 , which is a reflection of the nondecoupling nature of the interactions . scenarios that incorporate the vacuum misalignment mechanism  @xcite allow us to describe the transition from the nondecoupling to the decoupling regime through the parameter @xmath0 , such that at small @xmath3 one recovers a linear ( dimensional ) expansion .",
    "this means that the electroweak effective lagrangian , which is generally defined as @xmath81 with @xmath82 , should satisfy @xmath83 it follows that @xmath84 , while @xmath85 , with @xmath86_{\\xi\\to 0}\\ ] ] this non - trivial overlap between lo and nlo operators of the linear and non - linear bases has already been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "dimension - six operators coming from @xmath87 are suppressed by @xmath66 , whereas dimension - six operators stemming from @xmath88 have a @xmath77 suppression .",
    "the contribution of @xmath87 to every order in the @xmath3-expansion can be easily understood by noticing that powers of @xmath89 increase canonical dimensions but leave chiral dimensions unaffected .",
    "the generic dipole @xmath90 and triple - field - strength @xmath91 operators are not required as counterterms of the chiral lagrangian at nlo .",
    "concerning their importance in the eft we remark that the counting of chiral dimensions is less straightforward than the counting of canonical dimensions since the number of weak couplings ( carrying a chiral dimension of 1 ) is not always obvious from the field content of a given operator .",
    "we will next discuss some consequences of this in more detail , considering first the chiral lagrangian at scale @xmath2 , where the physics that has been integrated out resides at scale @xmath92 .",
    "the triple - gauge operators @xmath93 have three derivatives .",
    "the gauge fields are weakly coupled to the heavy sector , which implies the presence of ( at least ) three gauge couplings .",
    "this is true irrespective of whether the heavy sector itself is governed by weakly or strongly coupled dynamics .",
    "it follows that @xmath94 has chiral dimension 6 and therefore enters only at nnlo , that is with a double suppression @xmath95 .",
    "we remark that this argument generalizes the corresponding result of @xcite , obtained for the case of a weakly - coupled uv completion .",
    "an explicit example for the @xmath96 scaling of the coefficient of @xmath93 in the context of a strongly - coupled heavy sector is given by the model discussed in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that here the scaling of the coefficient does not automatically follow from the canonical dimension of the operator , which only implies a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of the additional loop factor @xmath97 is consistently accounted for through the counting of chiral dimensions .",
    "the situation may change when new states at the scale @xmath98 are integrated out to yield the eft at the scale @xmath1 . in this case , coefficients of order @xmath5 could arise for the @xmath93 operators .",
    "similar comments apply to the dipole operators @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , some of the four fermi operators are not needed as one - loop counterterms .",
    "however , they can be generated via tree - level exchange of a heavy resonance and are therefore kept at nlo .",
    "practically , as explained in @xcite , the list of operators up to linear order in @xmath3 is obtained by taking the full list of dimension - six operators in the linear basis  @xcite and performing the polar decomposition of the doublet @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the goldstone - boson matrix .",
    "the resulting operators are matched onto the leading and next - to - leading operators of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "an important subtlety is worth mentioning , which affects the whole matching procedure .",
    "since the linear basis is normally expressed in the unbroken phase , while the chiral lagrangian is written in the broken phase , in the former case there are nlo contributions that renormalize the lo parameters .",
    "the modified operators can be brought back to their canonical form by subsequent redefinitions of the fields and couplings . here",
    "we will omit details of such redefinitions and present the final results .    to leading order in chiral dimensions , and to first order in @xmath3 ,",

    "their breaking is thus generated by the gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "spurions must then come with an associated weak coupling , which carries chiral dimension .",
    "it then follows that the @xmath34 parameter is loop - suppressed and cp violating operators can only show up at nnlo .    in this sense ,",

    "we note that working with the full electroweak chiral lagrangian automatically includes all orders in @xmath3 .    in the following section we will give a more detailed account of how custodial symmetry breaking is implemented in the eft .",
    "this can be done without relying on the uv dynamics and will therefore lead to a number of model - independent conclusions .",
    "in this section we consider general properties of custodial symmetry and its violation in the electroweak effective lagrangian .",
    "the concept of custodial symmetry is well known .",
    "we review it here to provide the proper context for our subsequent general discussion of its violation by spurions in effective field theory .",
    "we assume that the electroweak sector exhibits the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry according to the pattern @xmath130 the associated goldstone fields @xmath131 , @xmath132 , parametrize the coset of the symmetry breaking in ( [ su2lrv ] ) , expressed through the @xmath133 matrix field @xmath101 , where @xmath134 are the generators of @xmath133 . under @xmath42 the field @xmath135 transforms as @xmath136 , with @xmath137 .",
    "the vacuum @xmath138 breaks this symmetry but remains invariant under @xmath43 , defined by @xmath133 transformations that obey @xmath139 .",
    "the residual , global invariance under @xmath43 is commonly referred to as the _ custodial symmetry _",
    "it is useful to distinguish two somewhat different meanings of this term . in the narrow sense",
    ", custodial symmetry refers only to the spontaneously broken dynamics itself , that is to the scalar sector ( higgs fields ) or the corresponding new strong interactions . in the general sense",
    ", custodial symmetry refers to all interactions , strong ( scalar ) dynamics and weak perturbations ( e.g. from gauge or yukawa couplings ) .",
    "when ( part of ) the symmetry @xmath42 is gauged , some of the gauge fields become massive via the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is instructive to consider the following possibilities of gauging a subgroup of @xmath42 and the resulting spectrum of gauge bosons : a ) @xmath140 ( 3 massive , degenerate gauge bosons ) ; b ) @xmath43 ( 3 massless gauge bosons ) ; c ) @xmath42 ( 3 massive , degenerate and 3 massless gauge bosons ) ; d ) @xmath141 ( standard model , 1 massless , 3 massive gauge bosons with @xmath142 ) . by the assumption of ( [ su2lrv ] ) ,",
    "all cases have a custodial symmetry in the narrow sense . in the general sense of the term",
    ", custodial symmetry is violated in the standard model ( @xmath142 ) , while cases a ) , b ) and c ) remain custodially symmetric , despite the weak gauging .",
    "the distinction between custodial symmetry in the general or the narrow sense is of course a matter of definition .",
    "however , it clarifies apparently different uses of the term in the existing literature .",
    "for instance , among the electroweak oblique corrections , the @xmath34 parameter , but not the @xmath143 parameter , is referred to as a measure of custodial symmetry breaking in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "also the @xmath143 parameter is viewed as a violation of custodial symmetry in @xcite .",
    "the apparent inconsistency is resolved when the former usage of custodial symmetry is understood in the narrow sense , the latter in the general sense of this term .    in the following , unless stated otherwise , we will adopt the meaning of custodial symmetry in the general sense as defined above .",
    "hence , both @xmath142 and the @xmath143 parameter violate custodial symmetry , at leading and next - to - leading order , respectively .    in general",
    ", the pattern of explicit breaking of custodial symmetry can be described by spurions @xmath144 .",
    "we will prove that , in the context of ( [ su2lrv ] ) , the only spurion of custodial symmetry breaking in the effective lagrangian is given by @xmath145 , the third generator of @xmath146 .",
    "as an illustration of this general theorem we point out how it is realized in the electroweak chiral lagrangian at leading and next - to - leading order , and also in the usual standard model with a linearly realized higgs sector through operators of dimension 6 .    for the case at hand ,",
    "the spurions are _ a priori _",
    "general @xmath147 matrices and @xmath148 fields , gauge field strengths and covariant derivatives , all of which come with an even number of @xmath149 indices .",
    "invariants can thus only be formed by contracting with matrices rather than with @xmath133 doublets as spurions . ] with formal transformation properties under @xmath42 , such that invariants under this symmetry can be built , in general involving also @xmath135 and further fields .",
    "the transformation properties reflect the physical origin of a given spurion . keeping @xmath144 fixed at its true ( constant ) value breaks the global symmetry in the appropriate way .",
    "any spurion must , in general , have one of the three possible transformation rules under the global group : @xmath150 an invariant @xmath151 is trivial and does not lead to custodial symmetry breaking . the hermitian conjugate version of ( [ chitrafolr ] ) is understood .",
    "a general @xmath147 matrix @xmath144 can be written as a linear combination of the unit matrix @xmath152 and @xmath134 , with complex coefficients .",
    "an essential restriction arises when part of the global symmetry is gauged , since only spurions consistent with gauge invariance are allowed . in the case of electroweak theory ,",
    "the entire @xmath140 and the weak hypercharge subgroup @xmath153 of @xmath146 are gauged .",
    "a spurion transforming as ( [ chitrafolr ] ) would break local @xmath140 and is therefore forbidden .",
    "scenario ( [ chitrafoll ] ) likewise breaks @xmath140 unless @xmath154 , which is the trivial case .",
    "similarly , ( [ chitraforr ] ) breaks @xmath153 unless @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "this leaves @xmath145 as the only nontrivial spurion and proves our assertion .",
    "the allowed spurions are different when a different part of the global group is gauged .",
    "an example is the chiral perturbation theory of pions , where the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry also follows ( [ su2lrv ] ) , gauged under the electromagnetic @xmath156 .",
    "the allowed spurions are then @xmath154 and @xmath157 , each transforming formally under ( [ chitrafolr ] ) , ( [ chitrafoll ] ) or ( [ chitraforr ] ) .",
    "this amounts to the quark mass term transforming as ( [ chitrafolr ] ) , and the electric charge operator transforming as ( [ chitrafoll ] ) or ( [ chitraforr ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath145 is the only spurion of custodial breaking under the electroweak gauging of ( [ su2lrv ] ) , can be illustrated with concrete examples .",
    "consider first the usual ( minimal ) standard model .",
    "the sm lagrangian can be viewed as the low - energy effective theory of any general uv completion that might exist .",
    "there are two sources of custodial symmetry breaking : weak hypercharge gauge interactions , and the difference in up- and down - fermion yukawa couplings .",
    "both are indeed governed by @xmath145 . in order to see that this is not just an accidental feature of the lowest - order lagrangian",
    ", one may inspect the full set of dimension-6 operators as classified in @xcite .",
    "these can be written in terms of the goldstone matrix @xmath135 and the higgs singlet @xmath148 , rather than in terms of the higgs doublet @xmath158 .",
    "this representation has been discussed e.g. in @xcite . in this way",
    "it can be demonstrated explicitly that , again , the only spurion of custodial breaking that appears is @xmath145 .",
    "the same observation holds for the electroweak chiral lagrangian at leading and next - to - leading order described in @xcite .",
    "some of the operators in @xcite are written in terms of the matrices @xmath125 and @xmath159 . to make the reduction to the spurion @xmath160 manifest one may use the identity @xmath161    the discussion of this section demonstrates in particular that the presence of @xmath145 as the only spurion of custodial - symmetry breaking in the general electroweak chiral lagrangian is a fully general , model - independent property of the effective field theory formulation , in contrast to the claims in @xcite .",
    "we now would like to show how some of the features that we discussed arise in the context of a specific model , the minimal composite higgs model of @xcite .",
    "this model assumes spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath162 down to @xmath163 at a scale @xmath2 , which generates four goldstone bosons .",
    "they span the coset space and can be parametrized as @xcite ( see appendix for details ) @xmath164 above we used the fact that @xmath163 is isomorphic to @xmath42 to express the @xmath163 vector @xmath165 in terms of the @xmath42 bifundamental field @xmath135 and the @xmath165 modulus @xmath166 .",
    "the custodial - preserving @xmath42 is further broken ( explicitly ) by the couplings to gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the spurion for this breaking is @xmath167 and is accompanied by powers of @xmath168 and/or yukawa couplings @xmath169 . for simplicity , in the following we will set fermions aside and focus on the cp - even bosonic sector .",
    "the leading - order lagrangian ( chiral dimension @xmath170 ) takes the form @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "the gauge kinetic terms are understood .",
    "the leading - order potential is @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the @xmath162-breaking spurions that are consistent with sm gauge invariance .",
    "the vector @xmath176 conserves custodial symmetry , the matrix @xmath175 violates it .",
    "both are related through @xmath177 .",
    "the coefficients have @xmath170 since they are loop - suppressed and they scale as @xmath178 , @xmath179 .",
    "a realization of such a potential in a specific model has been discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we note that the two terms in ( [ vab ] ) are given by the two independent expressions that can be built at leading order from the spurions of @xmath162 breaking , @xmath176 and @xmath175 . for @xmath180 and @xmath181 ,",
    "the potential in ( [ vab ] ) exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking , generating the vacuum expectation value @xmath182 via @xmath183 where @xmath182 ranges from the decoupling to the nondecoupling limit .",
    "the resulting mass of the physical scalar boson @xmath184 is @xmath185    to construct the operators at nlo ( @xmath186 ) , it is necessary to employ the general method of callan , coleman , wess and zumino  @xcite . for the case of the @xmath7 coset",

    "the @xmath7 example illustrates how its effective - theory formulation can be expressed in terms of the general chiral lagrangian of  @xcite . expanding the former to first order in @xmath3 provides an explicit realization of the silh lagrangian derived in section [ sec : silh ] .",
    "it also exhibits the presence of @xmath145 as the only spurion of custodial symmetry breaking , in agreement with the theorem of section [ sec : custodial ] .",
    "the representation of the operators in ( [ olchi ] ) makes it explicit that the higgs couples to a pair of field - strength factors only in the combinations @xmath226 these do not contain the photon - photon component @xmath227 and hence there is no @xmath228 operator at this order .",
    "this has been emphasized in @xcite and explained as the consequence of a residual shift symmetry that commutes with the electric charge @xmath229 , similar to the absence of @xmath230 at nlo in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this feature is valid for the nonlinear ( bosonic ) lagrangian defined at scale @xmath2 and represented at nlo through the terms in ( [ olchi ] ) .",

    "is then integrated out , which may induce the local operator @xmath231 with a coefficient of order @xmath5 as in  ( [ eq:7 ] ) , that is in general without extra suppression .",

    "our main conclusions can be summarized in the following points :    * we emphasize that the small-@xmath3 limit of the electroweak chiral lagrangian relies on a double expansion in both , powers of @xmath3 and the number of loops .",
    "phenomenologically , terms of order @xmath4 might be larger than the @xmath5 terms included in the conventional silh lagrangian .",

    "the silh lagrangian can be understood as the electroweak chiral lagrangian to first order in @xmath0 .",
    "this allows a systematic construction of the effective - theory operators with a well - defined power counting and without relying on particular uv completions .",
    "the resulting set of dimension-6 operators comes from both the lo and nlo chiral lagrangian and they are suppressed , respectively , by @xmath66 and @xmath77 . * in scenarios where the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson , the @xmath235 and @xmath233 amplitudes at scale @xmath1 receive local contributions of order @xmath5 .",

    "* we prove that , given the @xmath234 breaking pattern , custodial symmetry breaking is described by a single spurion , namely @xmath145 . if custodial symmetry is assumed to be preserved by the strong sector , and only broken explicitly by the weak sector ( gauge and yukawa couplings ) , the @xmath34-parameter appears as a nlo effect ( of chiral dimension 4 ) and comes with a suppression of @xmath236 .",
    "* as a concrete illustration of the previous points , we have considered the nlo operators of the cp - even bosonic sector of the @xmath7 model and matched them to the electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "to summarize , the electroweak chiral lagrangian , formulated with the vacuum misalignment parameter @xmath3 , gives not only a description of strict nondecoupling scenarios ( @xmath237 ) , but it is also valid for softly nondecoupling constructions ( @xmath21 ) , like the silh lagrangian .",
