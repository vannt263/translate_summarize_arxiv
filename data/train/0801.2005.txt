    "the physical formation and evolution processes taking place at various locations within a galaxy leave their fossil imprint in the stars .",
    "these chemodynamical imprints are the regular features observed in the stellar populations , photometry , internal kinematics and structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "furthermore , these features are found to correlate defining scaling relations of remarkable tightness , such as the colour - magnitude relation and the fundamental plane .",
    "this class of galaxy , therefore , is one of the best guides to compare observations and theoretical model predictions .",
    "theoretical scenarios that describe the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies include : a revised version of monolithic collapse , the dissipative ( wet / gas - rich ) and dissipationless ( dry / gas - poor ) merger alternatives of hierarchical clustering .    in the classical models of monolithic collapse ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , stars form in all regions during a rapid collapse and remain in their orbits , whereas the gas dissipates to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the shape and ellipticity of stellar orbits are expected to depend on the initial angular momentum of the collapsing protogalactic gas cloud and on the effect of gas viscosity in redistributing angular momentum , towards outer radii , during the collapse .",
    "the sinking gas is continuously enriched by evolving stars . as a consequence ,",
    "stars formed in the centre are predicted to be more metal - rich than those born in the outer galaxy regions .",
    "the efficiency of this process is proportional to the depth of the galaxy potential well , so that a strong correlation between metallicity gradient and galaxy mass is expected .",
    "the evolving stars are also responsible for the @xmath1-element enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . to reproduce the supersolar abundance of @xmath1-elements with respect to the iron - peak elements , observed in early - type galaxies , the models require that the collapse and star forming process occurred on timescales @xmath4  1  gyr , which will produce null or very small age gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , feedback processes such as supernova - driven galactic winds have been re - considered in more detailed numerical models of dissipative collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is suggested that they may create and shape the abundance gradients .",
    "galactic winds initiate when the energy injected by supernovae explosion balances the gravitational binding energy of the ism .",
    "the winds evacuate the gas , eliminating the essential fuel for any future star formation .",
    "the shallower local potential well of the external galactic regions supports the early development of winds with respect to the central regions .",
    "therefore , in the central regions the star formation and the chemical enrichment last longer .",
    "dissipation of gas towards the galaxy centre and a time - delay in the occurrence of galactic winds cooperate in steepening any metallicity gradient . in summary ,",
    "dissipative collapse models predict : i ) very steep negative metallicity gradients , that strongly correlate with galaxy mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ii ) small or null age gradients , as a consequence of the short timescales involved in the collapse and star formation processes , iii ) @xmath1-element enhancement gradients that can be either positive , negative or null ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , due to the  _ interplay between local differences in the star formation timescale and gas flows _ \" ( @xcite ) , iv ) isophotal shape and ellipticity proportional to the protogalactic initial angular momentum and its radial redistribution , v ) no peculiar internal kinematic structure . the difference between the original and revised dissipative collapse models focuses on the assembly of the initial gaseous material .",
    "the revised view accounts for the possibility of either a unique primordial cloud or the coalescence of many gaseous clumps without any preexisting stars",
    ". otherwise , the physical processes in galaxy formation are similar to that described above .    in the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation ( eg .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , elliptical galaxies are produced by merging events .",
    "early numerical simulations of galaxy mergers predicted contradictory radial variations of stellar properties in merger remnants .",
    "@xcite suggested that dissipationless mergers cause a flattening of metallicity gradients , whereas @xcite argued that the position of the stars in the local potential are preserved by violent relaxation and the gradients in the progenitors are only affected moderately .",
    "further simulations of @xcite , considered the hydrodynamical physics of the gas and found that during a dissipative merger a significant fraction of the progenitors gas tends to migrate toward the central regions of the merger remnant .",
    "@xcite showed that the gas accumulated in the central regions may trigger a local secondary burst of star formation .",
    "galaxy merger - induced star formation is predicted to produce metallicity and age gradients .",
    "positive or negative @xmath1-element enhancement gradients may also originate , depending on the original enhancement of the gas and the duration of the burst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite simulated dissipative mergers of two gas - rich disc galaxies of varying mass to form an elliptical galaxy remnant .",
    "their models show that metallicity gradients in merger remnants are shallower with respect to those predicted by dissipative collapse models and only weakly dependent by the remnant galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite simulated the formation and chemodynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies in a cold dark matter cosmology , focusing on internal metallicity gradients .",
    "the models ranged from a monolithic collapse scenario , seen as the assembly of tens of gas - rich subunits at high redshift , to dissipative and dissipationless mergers of equal - mass galaxies at low redshift ( which she denoted `` major mergers '' ) .",
    "the result was that galaxies of a given mass had steep metallicity gradients if formed by collapse and shallower gradients if formed by major merger ( dissipative or dissipationless ) .",
    "recently , combining the millennium cosmological n - body simulation ( @xcite ) with semi - analytic models , @xcite and @xcite focused on the distinction between the formation and assembly time ( redshift ) of elliptical galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in the hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "the models make use of the prescription of feedback from a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and supernova ( see @xcite ) to prevent excessive galaxy - mass growth from cooling flows .",
    "their model predicts a mass - dependent evolutionary history ( `` down sizing '' scenario ) , with more massive galaxies ( e.g bcgs , bggs ; brightest group galaxies ) forming a large fraction of their stars ( 50  @xmath5  80 per cent ) in progenitor systems at redshift @xmath0  2.5 .",
    "the progenitors then assemble into a single final object at z  @xmath0  0.8 .",
    "the formation epoch of less massive galaxies is predicted to be z  @xmath0  1.9 and the assembly time at redshift @xmath0  1.5 .",
    "the peak of the star formation history of massive galaxies is at redshift @xmath0  5 , and it progressively moves towards lower redshifts for less massive systems .",
    "similarly , the duration of the star forming episode is predicted to last longer in low mass galaxies .",
    "mergers are thought to induce bursts of star formation .",
    "therefore , the star formation history of a galaxy presents the `` bursty '' behaviour described in @xcite .",
    "the kinematics and internal structure of a merger remnant are a consequence of the progenitors mass ratios and the efficiency of the dissipative process ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that a dissipationless binary merger of equal - mass disk galaxies leads to a slowly rotating and anisotropic supported system ( @xmath6  0.4 ) with preferentially boxy isophotes and significant minor - axis rotation .",
    "whereas , the merger of unequal - mass disk galaxies produces a rotationally supported elliptical galaxy with a small amount of minor - axis rotation ( @xmath7  1.2 ; suggesting isotropic oblate rotators ) and disky isophotes . in dissipative mergers",
    "the gas is found to settle at the galaxy centre deepening the potential well and making it more axisymmetric .",
    "the isophotal shape of an equal - mass merger is then strongly affected by the gas , since most of the stars are gravitationally induced to move from boxy to more elliptical or even disky orbits .",
    "similarly , the disky isophotal shape of an unequal - mass merger remnant is weakly affected by the presence of gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in simulations of an equal - mass merger with induced star formation ( @xcite ) gradual gas dissipation forms an elliptical galaxy with disky isophotes , whereas a merger with rapid star formation produces both boxy and disky isophotes depending on the viewing angle of the observer .",
    "the merger of unequal - mass gas - rich disk galaxies is found to exhaust a large amount of the gas owing to moderate star formation and ending in the formation of an s0 galaxy ( @xcite ) . in summary ,",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation models predict : i ) shallow negative metallicity gradients , with little host mass dependence , ii ) age gradients and iii ) @xmath1-element enhancement gradients , that can be either positive or negative , due to the duration and location of the merger - induced star formation and the original abundance pattern of the gas , iv ) isophotal shape and ellipticity depending on the progenitors mass ratio and the efficiency of gas dissipation , v ) peculiar internal kinematic structures .",
    "the contrasting predictions of the galaxy formation models underline the lack of complete understanding of the physical processes behind the formation of galaxies .",
    "observationally , we now have the ability to obtain spatially resolved high signal - to - noise integrated spectra out to large galactic radii ( and hence larger mass fractions ) .",
    "this allows us to consider the physical mechanisms acting locally and how their properties vary with radius ( i.e. investigating beyond the central regions ) , proving invaluable constraints on the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "recently , an increasing number of works have focused their attention on stellar population radial profiles of galaxies in different environments ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results underline a common behaviour for the stellar population radial profiles of the studied galaxies : early - type galaxies are often characterised by strong metallicity gradients , shallow age gradients and null or statistically insignificant @xmath1-element enhancement gradients .    following from @xcite ( hereafter paper",
    "i ) we probe a possible star formation and chemical evolutionary history of the early - type galaxies ngc  1407 and ngc  1400 .",
    "we accomplish the task using the spectral lick / ids indices ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to determine the radial profiles in age , metallicity , [ z / h ] , and @xmath1-element abundance ratios , [ @xmath1/fe ] , out to @xmath0  0.6 ( ngc  1407 ) and @xmath0  1.30 ( ngc 1400 ) times the galaxies effective radii ( @xmath8 ; the radius within which half the galaxy light is contained ) .",
    "central values and gradients in age , [ z / h ] and [ @xmath1/fe ] are estimated and used as proxies of the quantity , velocity and duration of gas dissipation , star formation and possible merger events during galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the results from the spatially resolved radial kinematics and surface photometry analysis performed in paper  i. we compared colour radial profiles with colours predicted from spectroscopically derived ages and metallicities using single stellar population models .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the two sample galaxies . in sections  3 and 4",
    "we describe the observations and the relevant data reduction .",
    "section  4 presents the spatially resolved stellar population parameters . in section  5",
    "observed and predicted colour index radial profiles are examined . in section  6",
    "we summarise our results , and discuss the possible star formation and evolutionary histories of ngc  1407 and ngc  1400 . in section  7 conclusions are presented .",
    "the ngc  1407 , or eridanus - a , group is one of the 60 groups studied as part of the group evolution multi - wavelength study ( gems ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the study was designed to probe the evolution of groups and their member galaxies .",
    "ngc  1407 is the brightest group galaxy of the ngc  1407 ( or eridanus - a ) group .",
    "ngc  1400 is the second brightest group galaxy and it is characterised by a peculiar low velocity .",
