    "intense laser pulses of mid - infrared ( mir ) or thz frequencies have also become available recently @xcite . by employing these extreme sources of coherent light ,",
    "it is possible to investigate the optical response of materials in real time with a resolution much lower than an optical cycle @xcite .",

    "recently , we determined the sub - cycle change of the optical properties , i.e. , time - resolved dfke ( tr - dfke ) , which corresponds to the response and quantum path interference of a different phase locked dressed state @xcite . in particular , this ultra - fast change exhibits an interesting phase shift that depends on the field intensity and probe frequency . by utilizing this phenomenon",

    "the exponentially tail below the band gap , which is one of the feature of the franz - keldysh effect , can be seen .",
    "the oscillation above the band gap is owing to the absorption by the different @xmath103th dressed states and the blue shift of the band gap by @xmath54 . in this case",

    "the time - averaged dfke under linearly polarized light is presented by the blue dotted line .",
    "the overall features are quite different to the circularly polarized case .",
    "the most obvious difference is the amount of the blue shift , since the ponderomotive energy ( @xmath93 ) under the linearly polarized light is half of the @xmath54 .    at the same field intensity ,",
    "the photon density for circularly polarized light is twice that for linearly polarized light .",
    "the time - averaged dfke under linearly polarized light , whose photon density was equal to that of circularly polarized light , is presented by the green dash - dotted line .",
    "in this case , not only the amount of blue shift , but also the behavior below the band gap is similar to the result with the circularly polarized light .",
    "however , the oscillation above 9.5 ev is in contrast , with the difference possibly occurring due to the feature of each dressed state .",
    "the intensities of dressed states are expressed by the generalized bessel function for linearly polarized light . on the other hand , for circularly polarized light , the dressed state is expressed by the bessel function .    as a reference ,",
    "the numerical result for the static fke @xcite is represented by the blak dashed line . since the applied field intensity is stable with circular polarization , the tunneling effect is expected to be similar to the static fke . as expected",
    ", the behavior under the band gap agrees with the case of the circularly polarized light .",
    "however , the oscillation above the band gap is different .",
    "this result indicates that the fke under the circularly polarized light is not equivalent to the static fke , even though the intensity of the electric field is static .",
    "thus , the interpretation by the dressed states is indispensable .",
    "we present the analytical dfke formulation for circularly polarized light .",
    "we found that the time - dependent change of the optical properties observed under the linearly polarized light disappears . therefore , the linearly polarized light is suitable for the ultrafast control of the material response . on the other hand ,",
    "the response of the dressed state is still important for understanding the change in the optical properties caused by a circularly polarized light field .",
    "we also find that the @xmath94 is not important parameter for the circularly polarization case , but the value @xmath96 is important for both of the circular and linear pump light .",
