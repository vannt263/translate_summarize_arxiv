    "chaos synchronization has attracted considerably increasing attention and become an active area of research for both theoretical interests and practical applications , since seminal work of pecora and carroll @xcite . over the last decade , following the complete synchronization @xcite , several new types of synchronization have been found in interacting chaotic systems , such as generalized synchronization @xcite , phase synchronization @xcite , anti - phase synchronization @xcite , projective synchronization @xcite , lag synchronization @xcite and anticipating synchronization @xcite .",
    "complete synchronization is characterized by the convergence of the two chaotic trajectories , @xmath3 .",
    "it appears only when interacting systems are identical .",
    "generalized synchronization means the amplitude of the slave s state variable correlated with that of master s by a generic function , @xmath4 .",
    "phase synchronization is defined as the entrainment of phases of chaotic oscillators , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are integers ) , whereas their amplitude remains chaotic and uncorrelated .",
    "projective synchronization is the dynamical behavior in which the amplitude of the master s state variable and that of the slave s synchronizes up to a constant scaling factor @xmath0 ( a proportional relation ) .",
    "complete synchronization and anti - phase synchronization are the special cases of the projective synchronization in cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "lag synchronization means a coincidence of shifted - in - time states of two coupled systems , the state variable of the drive system is delayed by positive @xmath8 in comparison with that of the driven : @xmath9 , @xmath10 . whereas for anticipating synchronization , the driven system anticipates the driver : @xmath11 , @xmath10 . among those synchronization ,",
    "projective synchronization is one of the most interesting problems , because of its proportion between the synchronized dynamical states . in application to secure communications , this feature can be used to extend binary digital to m - nary digital communication @xcite for achieving fast communication .",
    "the early study of projective synchronization reported that the projective synchronization was usually observable only in the coupled partially linear systems @xcite .",
    "following work has extended that to a general class of chaotic systems without the limitation of partial - linearity @xcite .",
    "recently , hoang _ et al_. investigated a new synchronization in time - delay chaotic system , which they called projective - anticipating synchronization @xcite .",
    "projective - anticipating synchronization is a combination of the well - known schemes of projective and anticipating synchronization .",
    "that is , the driver synchronizes with the driven under the anticipating synchronization scheme and the amplitude is correlated by a scaling factor @xmath0 : @xmath12 . in the case of projective - lag synchronization @xcite , the amplitude of the master s and slave s state variables",
    "is correlated by a scale factor @xmath0 : @xmath13 .    however , most existing work about projective - anticipating and projective - lag synchronization focused only on two coupled chaotic systems .",
    "systems consisting of many interconnected subsystems are ubiquitous in nature and social science which can be described by complex networks @xcite .",
    "complex networks are usually composed by a large number of interconnected components ( nodes ) representing individuals or organizations and edges mimicking the interaction among them . with the development of research on complex systems , more and more researchers carried out the study about complex dynamical behaviors on networks .",
    "while most studies focused on complete @xcite and phase synchronization @xcite in various networks , little attention has been paid to projective synchronization .",
    "very recently , hu et al .",
    "@xcite studied the projective synchronization on drive - response dynamical networks by considering coupled lorenz chaotic systems .",
    "but due to finite signal transmission times , switching speeds and memory effects with both single and multiple delays are ubiquitous in nature , technology and society @xcite .",
    "time - delayed systems are also interesting because the dimension of their chaotic dynamics can be increased by increasing the delay time sufficiently @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", these systems are especially appealing for secure communication schemes .",
    "in addition , time - delayed system can be considered as a special case of spatiotemporal systems @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to consider an interesting topic whether we can achieve projective - anticipating , projective , and projective - lag synchronization of time - delayed chaotic systems on complex dynamical networks ? in this paper , inspired by the above discussions , we extends the work on projective - anticipating , projective , and projective - lag synchronization of two coupled chaotic systems to complex dynamical networks .",
    "we attempt to achieve projective - anticipating , projective and projective - lag synchronization in a general class of time - delayed chaotic systems related to optical bistable or hybrid optical bistable device on complex dynamical networks .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , according to the lyapunov stability theory @xcite , we theoretically analyze both the existence and sufficient stability conditions of the projective - anticipating , projective , and projective - lag synchronization of time - delayed chaotic systems on complex dynamical networks . in sec .",
    "iii , the well - known ikeda and mackey - glass systems are considered as the dynamics of single node to prove the validity of the proposed theoretical approach in sec .",
    "ii , respectively .",
    "finally we end this paper by a short conclusion in last section .",
    "for convenience , we study different types of projective synchronization of infinite - dimensional chaotic systems on erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks @xcite .",
    "consider an er network consisting of @xmath14 nodes which constitute the drive - response dynamical networks @xcite . in response dynamical networks , we connect each pair of nodes with probability @xmath15 , and denote the degree of node @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
