    "<S> determination of temperature from experimental data has become important in searches for critical phenomena in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> widely used methods are ratios of isotopes ( which rely on chemical and thermal equilibrium ) , population ratios of excited states etc . using the lattice gas model we propose a new observable : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the charge multiplicity and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is the charge of the fragmenting system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the reduced multiplicity is a good measure of the average temperature of the fragmenting system .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    0.5 cm    the extraction of a temperature from observables in a fragmenting system is a much studied problem in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it was originally estimated from the slopes of inclusive spectra of charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , such calibrations are suspect because of collective flow and other dynamical effects . </S>",
    "<S> other procedures were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> one method is to extract temperatures from populations of excited states of emitted fragments[1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the practical problem here is that of detector efficiency . if chemical and thermal equilibria are achieved , one may obtain temperature information more easily from a double isotope ratio defined by[2 ] @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total yield of the emitted fragment with mass and charge number @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> one chooses @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be the same for both the numerator and denominator to cancel out the effects of proton and neutron chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> this method was used in a recent paper[3 ] . in that work </S>",
    "<S> it was found that as a function of @xmath8 , the excitation energy per particle , the temperature was particularly flat around t=5 mev . this implied a maximum in the specific heat which could be the signature of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this observation has sparked renewed interest in the methods that were used to extract temperatures [ 4 - 7 ]    careful investigations reveal that the deduced temperature may depend upon the particular nuclei used in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus ambiguities remain . </S>",
    "<S> these ambiguities arise from effects of sequential decay and other processes neglected by the simple theoretical model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is extremely difficult to calculate such corrections from theory hence a phenomenogical approach was taken in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4 ] to estimate corrections . </S>",
    "<S> that analysis reduces much of the ambiguity .    in this communication </S>",
    "<S> we propose the reduced multiplicity @xmath9 as a thermometer , where @xmath1 is the charge particle multiplicity and @xmath2 is the charge of the fragmenting system . at zero temperature @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> is of order zero and at high temperature it approaches 1 . if @xmath10 monotonically increases with @xmath11 , one can attempt to extract @xmath11 from a measurement of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> there are several reasons why this needs be studied .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(1 ) the temperature extracted in this approach is in some sense an averaged temperature exploiting the properties of all fragments rather than a selected few which are used as thermometers .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) calculations show that @xmath10 is at least nearly , if not totally , independent of the size of the fragmenting system . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can use it for a range of systems of different sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) in other investigations a parametrization of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath11 may become useful for estimating critical exponents[5 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(4 ) success of the lattice gas model depends on the ability of predicting correctly overall yields at freeze - out density as the excitation energy per particle ( which is related to temperature ) changes . </S>",
    "<S> our past successes in correlating with data[8 - 10 ] suggest that the proposed method will be a reasonable measure of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(5 ) an important question is whether the numbers of clusters which are formed in such models will change a great deal by sequential decay . </S>",
    "<S> we like to point out that the formation of clusters in the lattice gas model is quite different from that in some other models , for example , the copenhagen model[11 ] . in the latter clusters </S>",
    "<S> are formed at a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a cluster at a finite temperature will have components of many excited states and many of these excited states can emit particles . in the lattice gas model this is done differently . from a global temperature we first generate by monte - carlo simulation momentum of each nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> we then decide with these momenta whether two nucleons will bind or not . </S>",
    "<S> thus our clusters do not have a temperature ; they instead have a well - defined excitation energy . within rules of classical mechanics </S>",
    "<S> they will not decay . </S>",
    "<S> the formula we use to deduce cluster sizes reduces a truly many - body problem into independent sums of two body problems . </S>",
    "<S> this is an approximation . </S>",
    "<S> there will be scenarios where our prescription for clusters will overestimate the size of a cluster . </S>",
    "<S> but there are also scenarios where our formula , for example , obtains two clusters , whereas the two clusters will actually coalesce into one . </S>",
    "<S> lattice gas calculation for clusters was compared with a many body molecular dynamics calculation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 12 ] and statistically negligible difference was found .    </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that actual nuclei are quantum mechanical objects and classical calculations should be followed by a ad - hoc correction . in this work </S>",
    "<S> however we stay entirely within the classical rules followed in the model and obtain the consequences . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice gas model has been described before[8,9 ] . in our previous calculations </S>",
    "<S> we had used the same value of interaction @xmath12 between neutron - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - proton . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive interaction was used . </S>",
    "<S> we now use an attractive interaction @xmath13 between neutron - proton but the bond between neutron - neutron and proton - proton should be either zero or slightly repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> this eliminates unphysical clusters like di - neutrons or di - protons and makes the model much more realistic . in accordance with a force much used in molecular dynamics calculation for nuclear collisions[13 ] </S>",
    "<S> we have used a slightly repulsive potential for neutron - neutron and proton - proton bond . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath12 is negative : @xmath12 is the only energy scale in the lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath12 can be chosen from binding energy considerations . in an infinite nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is about -5.33 mev . in real finite nuclei because of coulomb interaction and surface effects a lower value is expected to get the correct binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> as in the case of one type of bonds the thermal critical temperature appears at @xmath16[12 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus either use @xmath12 or @xmath17 as an energy unit . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the latter .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the dependence of temperature as a function of the reduced multiplicity @xmath9 for two systems with different mass number , a , and charge number z : a=137 , z=57 and a=87 , z=37 . in the calculation we assumed a freeze - out density @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of normal nuclear matter . as shown by the solid and dashed lines in the figure , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is largely independent of the size of the fragmenting system .    to explore the effect of freeze - out density on the temperature dependence on @xmath10 , two monte carlo calculations for the fragmenting system with a=137 , </S>",
    "<S> z=57 for @xmath20 ( solid lines ) and @xmath21 ( dashed lines ) are plotted in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the two densities correspond to the freeze - out density of light fragmenting systems[10 ] and medium fragmenting systems[8,9 ] notice that @xmath22 goes to zero at both @xmath23 and @xmath24 limit . </S>",
    "<S> all densities give the same high temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that the slope is zero at the low temperature limit is that a certain amount of energy will have to be supplied to the fragmenting system before it will split into two or more parts . </S>",
    "<S> this is a quantum effect of the lattice gas model due to the quantization of binding energy and lattice space .    to compare with experimental data , it would be desirable to have a simple formula so that for a given value of @xmath10 one can readily deduce the temperature given by this model . motivated by this </S>",
    "<S> we have tried a simple prametrization ; @xmath25 the results of such parametrization @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 , @xmath29 for low and high density respectively , are shown as the two dot - dashed lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parametrization agrees with the monte - carlo simulations up to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is well within the range of temperature that are of current interest . </S>",
    "<S> we will ignore the region beyond @xmath30 here . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we ignore the region of very low @xmath10 ( @xmath31 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , temperatures have been determined as a function of total charge particle multiplicities ( @xmath32 ) for the au+c system at 1 gev / a incident energies[5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis also extracted the fragment source size ( a ) and the multiplicities ( @xmath1 ) attributed to the emitted fragment source . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the fragment source has the same neutron to proton ratio as the au projectile , the following relations are obtained from ref . [ 5 ] ,    @xmath33    @xmath34    as the temperatures measured with the hydrogen and helium isotope ratios were more reliable and suffered less systematic uncertainties and sequential decay correction effects , we have plotted these data in fig . 2 by assuming @xmath35 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature @xmath17 is estimated to be about 4 - 6 mev depending on the size of the lattice system . </S>",
    "<S> in the present study , for simplicity , @xmath17 is treated as an adjustable parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the data agrees with the dashed line which is the prediction for breakup density of @xmath21 . over the region of @xmath0=0.1 to 0.4 , there is good agreement between data and calculations . at very low multiplicities , </S>",
    "<S> the data deviates from the calculations . instead of dropping rapidly to zero as in the calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the data remains nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this could arise from the inability to accurately deduce both the multiplicity and charge of the fragment source for very peripheral collisions .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the reduced charged particle multiplicity can be used to extract the average temperature of the fragmenting system . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted empirical parametrizations for eq . ( 2 ) that relates the temperature to the reduced charged particle multiplicity for the au+c system at 1 gev / a is @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath35 mev .    </S>",
