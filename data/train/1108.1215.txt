    "recurrent novae ( rne ) are interacting binaries where a non - degenerate companion star pours matter onto a white dwarf ( wd ) through roche lobe overflow , which accumulates on the surface until the pressure increases to the point where a runaway thermonuclear explosion sends out an expanding shell ( payne - gaposchkin 1964 ; bode and evans 2008 ) .",
    "only ten rne are currently known in our galaxy ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "the nova event on rne are identical to those of ordinary classical novae , but rne are different from classical novae in that their recurrence time scale is short enough that multiple eruptions have been detected .",
    "a short recurrence time scale ( say , shorter than a century or so ) requires two conditions .",
    "first , the wd must be near the chandrasekhar mass , with something like a mass @xmath8 m@xmath6 , so that the critical pressure can be achieved with a relatively small accreted mass .",
    "second , the accretion rate must be unusually high , with a rate of @xmath9 m@xmath6 yr@xmath10 , so that even this small critical mass can be accumulated quickly .    on the face of it , with a near chandrasekhar mass wd collecting mass at a high rate",
    ", the wd will soon reach the chandrasekhar mass and explode as a type ia supernova . with this logic ,",
    "the rne systems are a strong candidate for being the progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "the progenitor problem has been one of the more important challenges in stellar astrophysics for many decades ( parthasarathy et al .",
    "2007 ; livio 2000 ; branch et al .",
    "1995 ; trimble 1984 ; whelan & iben 1973 ) . in the last decade ,",
    "the identity of the progenitor systems has taken on an over - riding importance for many aspects of cosmology .",
    "the reason is that the type ia supernovae are now the premium tool for precision cosmology , but there is the outstanding problem that the evolution of the standard candle relation ( as we look to a more distant metal - poor universe ) depends on the progenitor class .",
    "the evolution effects might be comparable to the cosmological effects ( domnguez et al .",
    "2001 ) , so the progenitor problem must be solved before supernova can be used for precision cosmology . with this , the testing of rne as progenitors becomes a critical part of solving the progenitor problem .",
    "the primary problem with the above logic is that the rn wds not only accrete mass continuously , but they also eject substantial amounts of mass each eruption .",
    "so the real question is whether the wd is gaining mass as averaged over each eruption cycle .",
    "that is , is the ejected mass ( @xmath4 ) greater or less than the mass accreted between eruptions ? for an average accretion rate of @xmath11 and an inter - eruption time interval of @xmath12 ,",
    "the question is whether @xmath13 ?",
    "if ` yes ' , then the wd is gaining mass over each eruption cycle , the wd mass will soon increase to the chandrasekhar limit , and a type ia supernova is inevitable . out of the three quantities ( @xmath4 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) , the poorest known is the ejecta mass .",
    "so the evaluation of rne as progenitors is largely come down to measures of @xmath4 .",
    "the traditional method for determining @xmath4 is to measure the nebular emission - line fluxes , derive the emission measure , estimate the nebular volume , and then derive the ejecta mass . for a review , see gallagher & starrfield ( 1978 )",
    "unfortunately , this method is highly model dependent , requiring assumptions on the poorly known distance , the filling factor , the composition , and that a steady state is present .",
    "in addition , the volume of the shell depends on the cube of the expansion velocity , but it is unclear as to which velocity to adopt from an emission line profile ( e.g. , hwzi or hwhm ) and this leads to additional uncertainties of roughly two cubed .",
    "typical uncertainties in these assumptions leads to order - of - magnitude errors , so it is not surprising that published values for individual novae events range up to two orders - of - magnitude discrepant ( schwarz 2002 ; shaviv et al . 2002 ; vanlandingham et al .",
    "2002 : gallagher & starrfield 1978 ) .",
    "theoretical models have similar scatter .",
    "so in all , we can only agree with the gallagher & starrfield review that  the masses of material expelled by active novae are poorly known . \"",
    "if we are to ever understand whether rne are progenitors , we must have a much more accurate method to measure @xmath4 .",
    "an analysis of the methods and a summary of the specific reported values for both ci aql and u sco are presented in appendix a.    a solution for getting an accurate value of @xmath4 is to measure the change in the orbital period across the eruption event ( @xmath1 ) , as this will yield a confident dynamical measure of @xmath4 .",
    "the idea is that by kepler s law ( and the conservation of angular momentum ) the orbital period ( @xmath14 ) will change when the system s mass changes ( due to the loss of the ejected mass ) so that a measure of @xmath1 will directly give the mass loss .",
    "schaefer & patterson ( 1983 ) derive that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the white dwarf mass and @xmath17 is a parameter depending on the fraction of matter captured by the companion and the specific angular momentum of the ejecta .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is known to be unity to within perhaps 10% .",
    "the orbital period will change from its pre - eruption value ( @xmath18 ) to its post - eruption value ( @xmath19 ) , with @xmath20 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is generally easy to measure accurately over long time spans with either spectroscopic or photometric time series .",
    "the white dwarf mass will always be known to perhaps 30% uncertainty or @xmath21 for rne . in",
    "all , if we can simply measure the value of @xmath18 , then we can get an accurate measure of @xmath4 .",
    "schaefer & patterson ( 1983 ) realized that @xmath18 could be measured for novae with relatively long orbital periods and with deep eclipses by going back to archival photographic plates .",
    "that is , with approximate eclipse times ( from the times of plates showing the nova at the minimum of the eclipses ) spread over many decades , the @xmath18 can be measured with high accuracy . at the time",
    ", only one known nova ( bt mon , nova mon 1939 ) could possibly have this program completed .",
    "schaefer & patterson found that @xmath22 day , @xmath23 days , @xmath1 was 40 parts per million with the period _ increasing _ across the eruption , and @xmath24 m@xmath6 .",
    "this single measure of @xmath4 is the only reliable value known .    in 1987",
    ", i realized that the way to measure more reliable values of @xmath4 is to look at rne , as only in these cases can we know which stars to examine _ before _ their next eruption .",
    "( livio 1991 later independently had the same idea . ) but at the time , the majority of rne had no known orbital periods , and those that did were all uselessly long for this task .",
    "so i started a program for seeking photometric orbital modulation .",
    "this succeeded with the discovery of @xmath14 for five rne ( schaefer 1990 ; schaefer et al .",
    "1992 ; schaefer 2009 ) .",
    "one of the early discoveries was that the rn u scorpii ( u sco ) was a deeply eclipsing binary with a 1.23 day orbital period .",
    "the deep eclipses and manageable period enables the program of getting an extremely accurate measure of @xmath18 ( after the 1987 eruption ) .",
    "an early report with an accurate period was in schaefer & ringwald ( 1995 ) , with all subsequent eclipse times coming out only in 2011 with this paper .",
    "all it takes is to measure many eclipse times , await the subsequent eruption ( which came in 1999 ) , and then measure the post - eruption period . in 1988 , i knew that this would play into the even - then venerable progenitor problem , as well as that this would be a decades - long program .    in 2000 , the inconspicuous old nova ci aquilae ( ci aql ) had a _",
    "second _ observed nova eruption and joined the ranks of the rne . the first eruption was poorly observed in 1917 ( schaefer 2010 ) , while schaefer ( 2004 ) discovered a previously unrecognized eruption in 1945 . by great good fortune ( actually , more due to systematic long and hard work ) ,",
    "ci aql had already been identified as a deep eclipsing binary ( mennickent & honeycutt 1995 ) .",
    "they recorded pre - eruption light curves ( from which eclipse times can be derived ) from 1990 - 1995 .",
    "thus , ci aql had a @xmath18 measured , its eruption had already occurred , so all that was needed was to measure an accurate @xmath19 .",
    "this paper records the results of my program , started 24 years ago , to measure the period change across rn eruptions so as to measure @xmath4 , with application to the type ia supernova progenitor problem .",
    "two on - line tables will give essentially all the magnitudes in quiescence for both u sco and ci aql .",
    "eclipse light curves and templates are given in section 3 , with eclipse times in section 4 .",
    "the physics of the changes in the orbital periods , as well as the primary tool of the o - c diagram , are presented in appendix b. sections 5 and 6 derive the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath1 values for ci aql and u sco . in section 7 , i derive the @xmath4 for both rne .",
    "the higher analysis of these results are reserved for a separate paper .",
    "since 1987 , i have accumulated a large number of observations of ci aql and u sco in quiescence .",
    "journals of the observations are given in table 1 for ci aql and table 2 for u sco .",
    "unfortunately , my u sco observations from 1987 ( schaefer 1988 ) were not recoverable from magnetic tape , and it is ironic that century older astronomical plates still show the u sco field .",
    "most of the observations were made as time series photometry , where repeated ccd images were taken in rapid succession throughout eclipses .",
    "for ci aql , i report a total of 4960 magnitudes on 387 nights . for u sco ,",
    "i report a total of 2382 magnitudes on 116 nights .",
    "each ccd image underwent the standard processing ( bias subtraction , flat fielding ) and quality checks ( e.g. , bad columns , poor signal - to - noise ratio ) .",
    "photometry was all performed with the apphot package in iraf , which is fine for the uncrowded stars .",
    "the rn magnitudes were all performed differentially with respect to a suite of three comparison stars , with explicit coordinates and bvrijhk magnitudes as given in schaefer ( 2010 ) .",
    "the resulting magnitudes are presented in full in table 3 for ci aql and in table 4 for u sco .",
    "the first column lists the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) for the middle of each exposure .",
    "the second column gives the photometric band for each reported magnitude .",
    "( standard bands are indicated with one letter , while unfiltered ccd images with the zeros set by the v - band and r - band comparison star magnitudes are identified as ` cv ' and ` cr ' respectively . )",
    "the third column gives the derived magnitude for the rn .",
    "the fourth column gives the one - sigma error for the magnitude , where the statistical error ( as reported by apphot ) is added in quadrature with the estimated systematic error of 0.015 mag .",
    "the last column gives the orbital phase as calculated by the best linear ephemeris ( see below ) for the last decade .",
    "i have also spent much time looking through archival plate collections for magnitudes in quiescence .",
    "the goal was to find old plates that showed the rne in eclipse so as to get very old eclipse times .",
    "i have now examined all the plates for ci aql and u sco at harvard college observatory .",
    "i have also obtained scans of various deep schmidt plates from the palomar observatory , the european southern observatory , and the anglo - australian observatory , with these providing a small number of early magnitudes .",
    "in addition , all the archives at the maria mitchell observatory ( see robinson , clayton , & schaefer 2007 ) , sonneberg observatory , cerro tololo schmidt , and the tautenberg schmidt were exhaustively searched , without finding any useful images .",
    "all these photographic measures are also recorded in tables 3 and 4 .    for u sco",
    ", i have one additional eclipse time , during quiescence in june 1990 , from r. wade ( pennsylvania state university ) by private communication , based on continuum fluxes in a series of spectra . with a four night run on the cerro tololo 4-m telescope , wade covered one minimum on the first night , an ingress on the second night , and the remaining two nights were clouded out .",
    "the spectra were taken with the folded schmidt camera plus the ti ccd with grating 450 ( ii ) and the corning 9780 order filter .",
    "almost all exposure times were 1500 seconds .",
    "the observed magnitudes were taken with iraf software by measuring across the spectra from 0.47 - 0.48 micron wavelength .",
    "the long slit was simultaneously on u sco and the star labeled ` check ' ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "the u sco magnitude is with respect to that of check , which has a b magnitude of 18.60 .",
    "the scatter from outside eclipse suggests a one - sigma uncertainty of around 0.1 mag . on the first night ,",
    "only five measures are near the bottom of the eclipse , one point giving the egress , and several points giving the ingress . a parabola fitted to the last eight points of the first night give a chi - square of 10.4 for 4 degrees of freedom , and a time of minimum of hjd 2448043.7262@xmath250.0042 .",
    "the ingress light curve on the second night is not useable because the non - standard magnitude is not calibrated for the minimum or shape of the eclipse light curve .",
    "eclipse light curves have already been presented in schaefer ( 2010 ) and hachisu , kato , & schaefer ( 2002 ) for ci aql , and in schaefer ( 1991 ; 2010 ) and schaefer & ringwald ( 1995 ) for u sco . in this section",
    ", i will present new light curves with various views as well as templates of average light curves .",
    "i hope that modelers of these rne can use these templates as explicit tests for their models .",
    "figure 1 shows the folded light curve of ci aql from 1991 to 1996 . we see a prominent secondary eclipse , a prominent ellipsoidal effect , a symmetric light curve with the two maxima equal , and no large amplitude flickering .",
    "figure 2 shows the folded light curve of ci aql in three intervals throughout 2001 to illustrate the changing brightness as ci aql fades in the late tail of its eruption in 2000 .",
    "flickering is apparent in the tail , and the light curves in the tail are consistent in shape with each other , suggesting that the tail light is some uneclipsed isotropic fading source .",
    "figure 3 shows 3221 magnitudes in quiescence ( all the v - band magnitudes from 2002 to 2009 ) .",
    "many points come out .",
    "first , ci aql has occasional flickering up to a third of a magnitude .",
    "second , this flickering only appears outside of eclipse , apparently between orbital phases of 0.13 - 0.84 , with this result suggests the hot spot as being the source of the flickering .",
    "third , ci aql is brighter by 0.08 mag at the phase 0.25 elongation than at the phase 0.75 elongation .",
    "this unusual trait is shared by other rne ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "fourth , ci aql does appear to have a secondary eclipse with a duration comparable to the primary eclipse and an amplitude of around 0.1 mag .",
    "figure 4 shows superposed close - ups of eight well - observed eclipse light curves .",
    "there is no significant evidence for flickering during the eclipse .",
    "however , the magnitudes at minimum vary up and down by about 0.2 mag .",
    "therefore , a substantial part of the v - band light is coming from a region that is not eclipsed .",
    "this is consistent with the calculation of hachisu , kato & schaefer ( 2003 ) that the back edge of the accretion disk is not eclipsed , so that modest changes in the accretion rate ( and hence the disk brightness ) will cause the light at minimum to vary somewhat .",
    "figure 5 shows the folded light curve of u sco from 1988 to 1997 in the b - band .",
    "we see a deep eclipse with no flickering , yet for which the egresses and ingresses do not track identically from eclipse to eclipse .",
    "outside of eclipse , the brightness level apparently changes substantially with flickering light added on top .",
    "no secondary eclipse is visible this pre - eruption light curve appears indistinguishable from the b - band light curve for 2001 to 2009 .",
    "figure 6 shows the folded light curve from 2001 to 2009 in the i - band .",
    "again , there is no flickering during eclipse . as in the other bands ,",
    "the brightness levels for the uneclipsed system at the start of ingress and the end of ingress vary by up to half a magnitude .",
    "a prominent secondary eclipse is visible , as the companion star contributes a significant fraction of the system light in the i - band .",
    "figure 7 shows the folded light curve for the most homogenous set of data that i have , the eight eclipses from 2008 to 2009 in the i - band .",
    "we see that the eclipses are flat bottomed from phases -0.010 to + 0.010 , pointing to total eclipses .",
    "nevertheless , the magnitude at minimum does apparently jitter around by about a tenth of a magnitude .",
    "table 5 presents various light curve templates for both u sco and ci aql .",
    "that is , an average magnitude is given as a function of phase for various cases .",
    "the cases are for ci aql from 1991 - 1996 and 2002 - 2009 in the v - band , and for u sco in the b - band and the i - band .",
    "the template is intended to follow along the middle of the distribution of magnitudes at a given phase .",
    "this can be problematic for the case where light curves on different dates follow significantly different light curves , so that if few dates are available in some phase range , then the template can be distorted by the randomness of whether ` bright ' or ` dim ' nights are dominant .",
    "the purpose behind the eclipse timing is to measure some reproducible fiducial orbital phase , from which we can find the orbital period .",
    "the time of minimum light is when the maximum luminosity near the wd is covered up .",
    "that is , the eclipse minimum is the time of the conjunction between the companion star and the _ brightest _ spot of the same size . during quiescence",
    ", the brightest spot might be the hot spot , where the accretion stream hits the accretion disk , or it might be the inner disk , where the temperatures are highest .",
    "the point is that the eclipse minimum has some small offset from the geometric conjunction between the wd and the companion .",
    "and there will be some small jitter in the orbital phase of the minima due to changes in the relative brightness of the accretion components .",
    "but we can only accept this unwanted jitter , as there is no way measure the time of conjunction .",
    "the best method for determining the time of minimum depends on the number of magnitudes and their coverage of the eclipse .",
    "i will now describe the procedures for the case where the minimum is well covered ( section 4.1 ) , the case where only the ingress or egress is covered ( section 4.2 ) , the case where only one magnitude is available ( section 4.3 ) , the case where the eclipse is on the tail of the eruption light curve ( section 4.4 ) , and in the case of the few reported eclipse times in the literature ( section 4.5 ) . to end this section",
    ", i will collect all the minimum times ( section 4.6 ) .      a simplistic way to determine",
    "the time of minima is to take the time of the faintest point in the light curve . but",
    "this method is poor because ordinary poisson fluctuations throughout a fairly flat - bottomed minimum will cause the faintest point to be displaced from the true minimum by up to the half - duration of the minimum .",
    "so we should have a method to determine the minima times that somehow averages over many points near the minimum .",
    "another possible method is to bisect the times when the ingress and egress pass through some given magnitude .",
    "the poisson fluctuations and binning can be largely eliminated by fitting straight lines to the appropriate portions of the ingress and egress .",
    "this method has the advantage of using a fast changing part of the light curve , so that the times can be accurately determined . but",
    "this method requires that the light curve be symmetric around the time of minimum , and this is wrong at least far from the minimum .",
    "if we picked some bright magnitude then the systematic errors will be large and if we pick a magnitude near the minimum then the measurement uncertainties along the relatively flat portions of the light curve will be large .",
    "so we need a method that concentrates near the minimum ( so as to have minimal effect of the asymmetries in the light curve ) , gets above the minimum ( to where the rate of change of the light curve is substantial ) and uses many points ( to minimize poisson variations ) .",
    "i determine the time of minimum light by fitting a parabola to the near - minimum portions of the eclipse light curve .",
    "the minima of any function will be well - approximated by a parabola over a sufficiently small range , so the idea is to perform the fit over a sufficiently small range such that the asymmetric terms are negligible .",
    "( if i try to fit higher order terms , then the minimum time is sensitive to the order and to the chosen time interval for the fit . with variable coverage in time and with the eclipse",
    "shapes changing , the use of higher order terms only adds large systematic uncertainty . )",
    "this method has the advantages of being applicable to any light curve that covers the time of the minimum , of being insensitive to the high frequency noise from poisson fluctuations , and of being insensitive to asymmetries in the light curve .    in practice ,",
    "i determine the best fit parabola by the usual chi - square minimization .",
    "that is , a parabolic model with three parameters ( the time of minimum , the faintest magnitude , and the curvature ) is varied until the chi - square comparison between the model and the observations is best .",
    "the data points for inclusion in this fit are determined by the times over which the model is fainter than some cutoff magnitude .",
    "this cutoff is usually taken to be 0.1 - 0.2 mag brighter than the minimum , so that enough time is included for the curvature around the minimum to dominate and yet not so long that any asymmetries will be apparent .",
    "once a good minimum is achieved , then the points included in the fit are frozen and the fits is optimized again , with this being required so as to avoid effects where the chi - square is changing due to differing points being included in the fit .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainty on the time of minimum is found by varying the time until the chi - square has risen by unity from its minimum value .    in practice",
    ", i find that many of the eclipses have best fits for which the reduced chi - square is substantially smaller than unity .",
    "this is seen only in light curves where the quoted error for each point is dominated by the arbitrary systematic error that i added in .",
    "( for well exposed images , the statistical uncertainties , as reported by iraf , are always unrealistically small , so i have added a typical systematic error of 0.015 mag in quadrature as an effort to make the quoted error bars more realistic .",
    "this value is based on the typical scatter for standard stars in a plot of the reduced magnitude versus airmass , with the ultimate cause of this scatter being unknown . )",
    "this problem of a low reduced chi - square is fully consistent with the real systematic uncertainty being more like 0.010 mag for many of the observations . with the problem coming from a sometimes slightly conservative choice in the level of systematic errors ,",
    "the quoted error bars on the minimum time will be slightly too large for some eclipses .",
    "the parabola fitting method has a free parameter of the cutoff magnitude .",
    "this cutoff should not be too close to the minimum or else there will be too few points with too little curvature to well determine the time of minimum .",
    "nor should this cutoff be too near the out - of - eclipse level or else the asymmetries will make large systematic uncertainties in the derived time of minimum . within some middle range ,",
    "how sensitive is the derived minimum time to the choice of the cutoff magnitude ? to test this ,",
    "i have taken a typical light curve ( for the 2009 may 1 eclipse of ci aql ) with coverage throughout the eclipse .",
    "for this case , my normal analysis had used a cutoff of v=16.55 mag and found a minimum magnitude of 16.735 and a minimum time of jd 2454953.7887@xmath250.0003 . for cutoff magnitudes of 16.70 , 16.65 , 16.60 , 16.55 , 16.50 , 16.45 , and 16.40 ,",
    "the fractional part of the best fit julian date is 0.7890@xmath250.0009 , 0.7889@xmath250.005 , 0.7887@xmath250.0003 , 0.7887@xmath250.0003 , 0.7886@xmath250.0002 , 0.7887@xmath250.0002 , and 0.7885@xmath250.0001 resepctively .",
    "as expected , the statistical uncertainty gets smaller as the cutoff is raised .",
    "( the systematic uncertainty from the light curve asymmetry will get larger as the cutoff is raised . )",
    "importantly , the variations in the derived minimum time due to changing the cutoff are always small compared to my final error bars , which is to say that the best fit eclipse time is insensitive to the choice of the cutoff for any reasonable range .    as a further test of the parabola fitting method as well as of the asymmetry in the light curve ,",
    "i have performed the bisector method for various well observed eclipses . in the same case as in the previous paragraph ( for the 2009 may 1 eclipse of ci aql ) , i have fitted line segments to portions of the ingress and egress . with these fits ,",
    "i get the time when the light curve passes through various fiducial magnitudes , and these times are then bisected to get a minimum time . for fiducial magnitudes of 16.70 , 16.65 , 16.60 , 16.55 , 16.50 , 16.45 , and 16.40 ,",
    "the fractional part of the julian date for the minimum is 0.7889 , 0.7885 , 0.7886 , 0.7884 , 0.7882 , and 0.7880 .",
    "we see a systematic but small shift as the fiducial magnitude is raised , and this is a demonstration of the level of change caused by the asymmetries in the light curve . for the middle range of fiducial magnitudes , the changes are always small compared to the final quoted uncertainties . from the above , i conclude that the parabola fitting method is robust and produces accurate ( or slightly too large ) error bars .",
    "a number of eclipses were covered with fast time series photometry , but only a portion of the eclipse was covered .",
    "this was usually due to clouds or twilight intervening .",
    "without substantial coverage on both sides of the minimum , the parabolic fitting procedure does not work reliably .",
    "nevertheless , these data still provide strict constraints on the time of the minima .",
    "the general procedure that i will use to derive the minima times will be to determine the average offsets between when the eclipse light curve passes through some fiducial magnitude as based on light curves with full coverage ( see the previous subsection ) and then apply these offsets to the partial - coverage light curves ( this subsection ) .    from figures 4 and 7 , it looks like the shape of the eclipse light curve is nearly constant .",
    "( this is not perfect , as both rne show some variations from orbit - to - orbit . )",
    "when all the light curves are shifted to a common minimum , the light curves fall on top of each other with only moderate scatter .",
    "so for example for ci aql , when the ingress fades through a magnitude 0.2 mag brighter than the minimum that time is 0.0216 day before the minimum on average , and when the egress brightens through the same magnitude that time is 0.0203 day after the maximum on average .",
    "this can be placed into an equation as @xmath26 where @xmath12 is the offset in time from when the brightness passes through the fiducial magnitude ( @xmath27 ) , with this value a function of @xmath28 , the branch ( ingress or egress ) , and the star .",
    "i will take the fiducial magnitude to be 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 mag brighter than the observed minimum magnitude ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this simple offset in time can often be improved by taking account for the slope of the light curve as it passes through the fiducial magnitude .",
    "that is , if the eclipse light curve is ` flatter ' ( with a weaker parabolic term ) , then the slope will be shallower and the time offset will be greater . this relation can be quantified as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the derived time of minimum , @xmath27 is the time when the eclipse light curve passes through some fiducial magnitude @xmath28 , @xmath17 and @xmath32 are two constants that depend on @xmath28 , and @xmath33 is the observed slope of the light curve ( in magnitudes per day ) when it passes through @xmath28 . @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath33 are both calculated from the light curve by fitting a simple line to the magnitudes within a small range centered on @xmath28 . in general ,",
    "eq . 2 is better than eq .",
    "1 , other than the case where the fiducial magnitude is too close to the minimum so that the measurement uncertainties dominate . also , for the case of u sco in the b and v bands , i have too few fully - covered light curves to measure a and b , so i can only use eq . 1 .",
    "the constants in equations 1 and 2 can be derived from the well - observed eclipses , for both ingress and egress , for fiducial magnitudes 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 mag brighter than the eclipse minimum . for ci aql ,",
    "the constants have been derived from 19 eclipses with good coverage from 2002 - 2008 . for u sco ,",
    "the constants have been derived for 3 , 1 , and 17 eclipses with good coverage from 1994 - 2009 .",
    "the average values of @xmath12 , a , and b are reported in table 6 for both branches for both rn for all four fiducial magnitudes . from these eclipses ,",
    "i have also calculated the rms scatter in the deviation between the derived minima times versus those derived by parabola fitting , @xmath34 , with these being the accuracy in the derived eclipse minimum time for any one measure .",
    "if the light curve includes a recognizable minimum , then the fiducial magnitude can be determined , the observed light curve will yield the time and slope for when the rn passes through this fiducial magnitude , and then eq . 1 or eq .",
    "2 plus the values in table 6 can be used to derive the minimum time and its one - sigma uncertainty .    amongst the eclipse light curves with partial coverage ( so that a parabola fit is not reasonable ) , many do cover the minimum , so that the minimum magnitude can be measured to better than 0.01 mag . for these , the fiducial magnitudes are known to good accuracy and the one - sigma uncertainties in table 6 represent the entire error bars . for many partial light curves , the minimum is not covered , so the minimum magnitude is not known and the fiducial magnitudes have corresponding uncertainty .",
    "so for example , if we only observed a descending branch , then we could assume the minimum equals the average minimum , take the fiducial magnitude to be some value , extract a time and a slope from the light curve , and then deduce the time of minimum .",
    "alternatively , if we take the minimum to be fainter than average , then our fiducial magnitude would be fainter , the time when the ingress crosses that fiducial magnitude would be later , and the derived minimum time would be later . therefore , when the minimum magnitude is not observed , an additional uncertainty will arise from not knowing the correct fiducial magnitudes . for cases where",
    "the minimum is not directly observed , the best that i can do is simply to take the average for that rn and filter . for ci aql in the v - band ,",
    "this is 16.74@xmath250.05 . for u sco ,",
    "the average @xmath29 is 19.98@xmath250.14 , 18.96@xmath250.05 , and 18.18@xmath250.07 in the b , v , and i bands respectively .",
    "i have taken account for this by the propagation of errors , where the uncertainty in the minimum magnitude is taken to be the rms scatter of the minima .",
    "for each light curve , i measure the times and slopes for as many of the fiducial magnitudes as possible ( for 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 mag above minimum for ingress or egress ) , and derive a time of minimum for each .",
    "if one whole branch plus the minimum is observed , then we will have four derived times each accurate to 0.0019 - 0.0066 day ( see table 6 ) , then these times can be combined as a weighted average .    as a test for the procedure described in this subsection ,",
    "i have applied it to the ten well - observed ci aql light curves from 2009 .",
    "these ten eclipses have accurate minima times from parabola fitting .",
    "the deviations of the derived minima times from the procedure in this section versus the accurate times from parabola fitting will provide a good measure of the real accuracy of the procedure .",
    "for the case where the minimum magnitude is known from the observed minimum ( as when one of the branches plus the minimum is observed ) , i have 61 measures of the deviations , each from a particular eclipse and fiducial magnitude .",
    "the rms of the deviations is 0.0024 day . for the case where the average minimum magnitude ( 16.71@xmath250.07 ) is adopted ,",
    "the rms of the deviations is 0.0036 day . for the case where i take weighted means of minimum time",
    "estimates from multiple fiducial magnitudes , i find that the rms deviations are 0.0022 day for when the minimum magnitude is known and 0.0027 day for when the average case is adopted for the minimum magnitude .",
    "these improvements are smaller than expected if the individual measures are independent .",
    "i take this to mean that the various measures along each branch are not independent , with the implication that one fiducial magnitude is almost as good as averaging the results from up and down the light curve .",
    "another implication is that the formal error bars obtained by the weighted average from multiple measures will always be too optimistic . with this experience",
    ", i will adopt one - sigma uncertainties of 0.0022 for the case where the minimum magnitude is well - measured and 0.0027 days for the case where it is not measured .      certainly the best way to get",
    "an eclipse time is to have full coverage across a minimum , or at least with substantial portions of the ingress or egress .",
    "unfortunately , many of the key old eclipses were only observed with _",
    "one _ image . for ci aql",
    ", we have all of the pre - eruption data as these single images ( either from the harvard plates or from roboscope ) .",
    "there is still good information as to the time of the eclipse minimum , even though the accuracy will be poorer than the situations with time series .",
    "so for example , if an old plate shows the rn at the magnitude usually taken as the eclipse minimum , then the middle time for that plate will be the best estimate of the minimum time with some to - be - determined error bar . or if an old ccd image shows the rn halfway between the usual minimum and maximum levels , then the time of minimum will be roughly the middle exposure time plus - or - minus a quarter of the eclipse duration",
    ". in most cases , the ambiguity of knowing whether the image is during the ingress or egress will be resolved by comparison with other plates similar in time . with this",
    ", the many pre - eruption roboscope images of ci aql can be used to determine the eclipse times with fairly good accuracy , and the few harvard plates showing ci aql in eclipse are so far back in time that the long lever arm will finely constrain the o - c diagram despite moderately large uncertainties in the eclipse times .    for the roboscope data on ci aql ( mennickent & honeycutt 1995 )",
    ", the magnitudes are almost all once per night . the folded light curve ( see fig .",
    "1 ) easily resolves whether the image is on the descending or rising branch .",
    "the estimate of the time of minimum is as easy as interpolating the observed magnitude in the ci aql 1991 - 1996 template ( table 5 ) , and adding the corresponding time offset to the observed time .",
    "i have selected all images with the phase within 0.068 of eclipse by the original minnickent & honeycutt ephemeris .",
    "the uncertainty in how much brighter this measured magnitude is above the minimum will be the quoted photometric uncertainty ( typically 0.02 - 0.04 mag ) added in quadrature with the vertical scatter in the eclipse light curves ( 0.05 mag , compare with figure 4 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is then propagated through the eclipse light curve template to get the uncertainty in the time of the minimum .",
    "the resultant error bars range from 0.0040 to 0.0117 days ( with one at 0.0263 days ) depending on the observed magnitude .    for the harvard plates ,",
    "the typical exposure time is one hour , and this smears out the recorded light curve ( schaefer & patterson 1983 ) .",
    "ci aql was positively detected on 12 plates in quiescence , and one plate had a very faint limit .",
    "( this is in addition to the 20 plates at harvard which recorded ci aql in eruption , see schaefer 2010 . )",
    "the typical b - band magnitude at maximum light is 17.0 - 17.2 mag .",
    "so the two plates taken with @xmath35 ( plate mf10536 ) and with @xmath36 ( plate a17852 ) are certainly near the eclipse minimum .",
    "as such , the middle time for the plate exposure is taken as the time of the eclipse .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate will be comparable to the half exposure time ( 0.02 days ) plus the half duration of minimum ( @xmath370.01 days ) , which i will take to be 0.03 days      after the nova shell becomes optically thin ( at the end of the initial fast fall in the light curve ) , the binary system and its eclipses are visible .",
    "the rne can be well observed during the tail of its eruption , partly because observers have the interest of the eruption to motivate sustained photometry and partly because the star is brighter than in quiescence so it is easier to observe .",
    "this photometry might be either a fast time series by a single observer that happens to cover the time of an eclipse or as single magnitudes taken on many nights ( possibly by many independent observers ) folded on the period to provide a phased light curve .",
    "a problem with combining magnitudes over many nights is that the uneclipsed nova light is fading , so any folded light curve must be detrended first .",
    "a problem with combining magnitudes from many observers is that often each observer will have some small offset so as to convert their quoted magnitudes onto some standard magnitude system .",
    "these problems are simple to overcome , yet they will nonetheless lead to some increased scatter in any combined light curve .    for the case of the early tail in the 2000 eruption of ci aql , the folded and detrended light curve ( fig .",
    "8) shows significant and substantial roughly - sinusoidal modulation on the orbital period . for days 40 - 200 after the peak",
    ", we see a well defined sinusoidal envelope roughly half a magnitude in width that contains most of the points .",
    "the best fit sinusoidal amplitude is 0.16@xmath250.02 mag and the phase of minimum is -0.037@xmath250.017 .",
    "that is , the minimum in the light curve comes 0.0229@xmath250.0105 days early in comparison with the post - eruption ephemeris , and this gives a minimum epoch of hjd 2451792.7070@xmath250.0105 .",
    "the scatter about the best fit sine wave is much larger than the observational uncertainty ( typically 0.15 mag for visual observations ) , and i have to add in quadrature a value of 0.26 mag so as to get a reduced chi - square equal to unity .",
    "the cause of this larger scatter is undoubtedly a combination of imperfect detrending and intrinsic variations of ci aql that are on faster timescales than the trend line can take out .",
    "the light curve does not show any primary eclipse .",
    "i interpret this as being caused by an emission region that is substantially larger than the binary orbit ( so any eclipse of its center would cause only a small drop in light ) and that is transparent enough so that the inner regions can be seen ( with the irradiation of the inner hemisphere on the companion providing the modulation with the orbital period ) .",
    "that is , the outer ejected shell has already faded to insignificance in the continuum light , the luminous and extended envelope would provide most of the light , the binary would primarily be visible due to the hot illuminated hemisphere of the companion star , and the accretion disk is still disrupted by the nova wind that is creating the extended envelope .",
    "i have observed two fast time series of ci aql in its late decline phase ( august 2001 , see fig .",
    "2 ) . both are well observed minima , for which i used the parabola fitting method to find the minimum time .",
    "as the light curve had not yet returned to the quiescent level , these two times will have to be treated as eruption times , with potential systematic offsets when compared to the true queiscent conditions .",
    "the 1945 eruption of u sco was discovered as part of an exhaustive search through the harvard archival plates , with the ( perhaps surprising ) result that a full eruption was well - covered on 37 plates ( schaefer 2010 ) . until the 2010 eruption , these plates provided the only late coverage of the u sco light curve , with 20 magnitudes covering the time from 33 to 47 days after the peak .",
    "( the exact hjd of the plates has been confirmed from the original logbooks as well as the calculated values on the plate envelopes . )",
    "this late coverage is during a time when eclipses are prominent ( schaefer et al . 2010 ) , so this provides an opportunity to seek an eclipse time in the tail of the 1945 eruption . with the b - band magnitudes reported in schaefer ( 2010 ) ,",
    "i have determined a trend line , with this being subtracted out .",
    "the folded de - trended light curve ( figure 9 ) shows an obvious eclipse , and we can even see the slow ingress known from the 2010 eruption at the same time after peak ( schaefer et al .",
    "the points in the minimum and along the egress are all from one night ( 2 july 1945 ) .",
    "i have performed a chi - square fit to compare the measured magnitudes to the light curve template derived for the same time after peak from the 2010 eruption ( schaefer et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the measurement errors for the magnitudes is 0.15 mag , and to this i have added 0.10 mag in quadrature so as to represent the orbit - to - orbit scatter known from the 2010 eruption light curve .",
    "the only free parameter in this fit is the phase of the minimum .",
    "the best fit phase of minimum corresponds to hjd 2431639.300 .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainty is @xmath250.009 days .",
    "the 1987 eruption of u sco ( schaefer 2010 ) has few magnitudes on the plateau phase ( during which eclipses would be visible ) .",
    "these points happen to include no values with phase between 0.78 and 1.08 , so no eclipses could have been detected .",
    "the 1999 eruption of u sco has many magnitudes after the fast early decline ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "several eclipses are visible in the de - trended light curve .",
    "one eclipse at 19 days after the peak has already been reported by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "another eclipse is visible 25 days after the peak , but only ingress is recorded . with the minimum magnitude uncertain by perhaps even half a magnitude ( due to questions on subtracting the trend as well as the depth of the eclipse at that epoch ) , the uncertainty in the derived time of minimum ( cf .",
    "section 4.2 ) will be much too large to be of any use .",
    "the only other confident eclipse is 30 days after the peak . here",
    ", the light curve is seen to be rising , with the faintest magnitude being 1.21 mag fainter than the accurately known trend line , so the first observations is certainly very close in time to the minimum .",
    "i take the time of minimum to be the time of this first observation , and give it an uncertainty appropriate for the sampling and the observed duration of minima from 2010 .",
    "thus , i get the minimum time to be hjd 2451265.3060@xmath250.0100 .",
    "eclipse times in quiescence have already been published for both ci aql and u sco in schaefer ( 1990 ) and schaefer & ringwald ( 1995 ) , with all of these times now being superseded by the analysis in this paper .",

    "the only useful time that i can pull out of their paper is their specified epoch for their new ephemeris , julian date 2452081.5022@xmath250.0046 , which presumably has a heliocentric correction , and which presumably represents an observed minimum time .    for u sco , thoroughgood et al .",
    "( 2001 ) identified an eclipse as based on seven flux density measures from spectra during the 1999 eruption .",
    "the eclipse is at a time 51 days after the peak , which corresponds to the middle of the second plateau phase ( schaefer et al .",
    "they fitted a parabola to the full minimum , and reported the heliocentric julian date of the minimum as 2451286.2143@xmath250.0050 .    for u sco , kato ( 2001 )",
    "measured 22 magnitudes over 0.14 days ( early in the 1987 eruption ) to find random fluctuations , for which he picked out one to identify as an eclipse minimum .",

    "also , this time series was taken just seven days after the peak , at a time when we know that the nova shell is optically thick and eclipses are not visible ( schaefer et al .",
    "so i reject this time as a valid eclipse time .",
    "kato ( 2001 ) makes a further claim to have recognized an eclipse in a folded light curve based on data from the vsolj .",
    "however , the claimed eclipse has much too short a duration to be the real eclipse . and these observations were collected from 5 - 11 days after the peak , so they can not represent eclipses .",

    ", we now know that the nova shell was optically thick at six days after the peak , so no eclipse could be visible ( schaefer et al . 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , i reject this claimed secondary minimum time .",
    "matsumoto et al . ( 2003 ) also report the time of one primary minimum , based on piecing together an egress and the next ingress .",
    "their reported time is hjd 2451254.211 , which is 19 days after the peak , on the first plateau .",
    "no error bar in the eclipse time is quoted , so i will adopt @xmath250.01 days as appropriate for their sampling .",
    "with these observations and analysis procedures , i have tabulated all known eclipse times for both ci aql and u sco .",
    "these are presented with identical formats in table 7 for ci aql and table 8 for u sco .",
    "the first column gives the ut date of the observed minimum .",
    "the second column gives the observatory and/or telescope used to make the observations , or alternatively the data collecting organization and the observer .",
    "the third column lists the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) of the observed time of minimum light ( @xmath38 ) and its one - sigma uncertainty .",
    "the fourth column gives a running integer , n , which keeps track of the cycle count as used in the ephemeris equations .",
    "the last column gives the o - c value ( in units of days ) for the observed hjd versus the model time as based on the best - fit post - eruption linear ephemeris .",
    "the orbital period of a nova will change for many reasons . across an eruption , the period will change suddenly ( @xmath1 ) due to the loss of the the ejected mass ( the effect being sought here ) and the drag of the companion star during the common envelope stage . between eruptions , the period will have a steady period change ( @xmath0 ) due to the mass transfer and due to angular momentum losses .",
    "these changes can be illustrated and analyzed with the o - c diagram .",
    "full details on the physics of the period changes and the o - c diagram ( with equations and examples ) are given in appendix b.    the time period from 2001 to 2009 ( i.e. , the post - eruption interval ) is by far the best observed for ci aql .",
    "so i will start by considering an unchanging period and only those eclipse times after the end of the 2000 eruption ( section 6.1 ) .",
    "this will provide the base linear model for use in the o - c diagram . in section 6.2",
    ", i will consider the steady period change ( @xmath0 ) between eruptions .",
    "i will evaluate @xmath0 by fitting curvature in the o - c diagram for 2001 - 2009 and by placing constraints from theory . in section 6.3 , with my post - eruption ephemeris",
    ", i consider the eclipse times in the tail of the 2000 eruption .",
    "i will find that the eclipse times in the tail are systematically early , due to the shift of the center of light . in section 6.4",
    ", i will add in the 1991 - 1996 eclipse times . with the well - measured @xmath14 and @xmath0 for the post - eruption interval ,",
    "i extrapolate back to the time of the eruption .",
    "this time is the end point for the o - c curve of the pre - eruption interval .",
    "indeed , this end point will be the best measured point on the pre - eruption o - c curve , and will serve as the anchor for measuring @xmath18 .",
    "the pre - eruption o - c curve ( from the roboscope data plus the extrapolated eclipse time at the epoch of the eruption ) will then be fit with the allowed range of @xmath0 so as to get the period change across the eruption . finally , in section 6.5",
    ", i will make a fit to all 76 non - eruption eclipse times from 1926 - 2009 .",
    "the fits will vary substantially within the allowed range of @xmath0 and whether there are one or two undiscovered eruptions between 1941 and 2000 .",
    "this will give us a range of possible period changes across the eruptions .",
    "i have 45 post - eruption eclipse times from november 2001 to september 2009 ( see table 7 ) .",
    "the o - c diagram is plotted in figure 10 .    for the many highly accurate eclipse times",
    ", we see a scatter that is significantly larger than any smooth curve we could draw",
    ". this scatter can not be due to measurement errors , nor to jitter of the position of the stars in their orbit .",
    "the likely cause of the scatter is changes in the brightness of the accretion disk across the duration of the eclipse minimum .",
    "the backside of the accretion disk is still visible during mid - eclipse ( hachisu et al .",
    "2003 ; lederle & kimeswinger 2003 ) and that the disk brightness changes on all timescales ( see figs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "so , if the visible part of the disk is brightening across the eclipse minimum then the light curve will be ` tilted ' such that the apparent minimum occurs early , whereas if the disk is fading across the eclipse minimum then the light curve will have the apparent time of minimum occur late .",
    "this is an easy and expected explanation for intrinsic jitter in the apparent eclipse minimum times .    with this intrinsic scatter , the real uncertainty of each minimum time for indicating",
    "some fiducial orbital phase will be larger than the quoted measurement error bars in table 7 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter will be some constant throughout the post - eruption interval , roughly given as the rms scatter of the best measured points around the best fit smooth curve",
    ". the total uncertainty in the fiducial orbital phase will be the addition in quadrature of the measurement error and the intrinsic scatter .",
    "formally , i will derive the intrinsic scatter as that value which produces the best fit reduced chi - square equal to unity for the 2001 - 2009 interval .",
    "for the model that the o - c curve is linear , i have used a chi - square fitting routine to derive the best fit period and epoch . for this fit ,",
    "i have chosen the fiducial epoch to be near the peak date for the eruption .",
    "i find an epoch of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . with an intrinsic scatter of 0.00136 days ( 1.9 minutes ) ,",
    "i get a fit with a chi - square of 43.0 for 43 degrees of freedom .",
    "so the scatter caused by the disk variations is less than two minutes , while the orbital period is known to 0.0043 seconds accuracy .",
    "this period has the fractional accuracy of 81 parts per billion .",
    "the o - c curves can be readily interpreted if the model is linear .",
    "so i should choose some linear model , and i chose to use this best - fit post - eruption linear model as my fiducial linear model .",
    "so all my o - c values and plots are constructed with @xmath41 as in table 7 and figure 10 .",
    "@xmath42 is an integer that counts the orbital cycles from the original epoch .",

    ", i can only constrain @xmath52 days per cycle .",
    "the 45 post - eruption eclipse times can be fit to equation 20 in appendix b , with no ambiguity relating to period changes related to eruptions .",
    "i find the best - fit for @xmath53 , @xmath54 days , and @xmath0= -24@xmath5510@xmath56 days per cycle .",
    "this gives a chi - square of 42.0 .",
    "the one - sigma range ( i.e. , the range over which the chi - square is within 1.0 of the minimum ) , is @xmath57 in units of days per cycle . with this , @xmath0 is likely negative , and this means that the @xmath58 term in equation 12 must be substantial and will dominate over the effects of the steady mass transfer .",
    "the constraint arising from the 1926 and 1935 eclipse will depend on the derived @xmath1 value , which will come from section 6.4 . in all ,",
    "the best constraints on @xmath0 are those given in equation 4 , while the best estimate is @xmath0= -24@xmath5510@xmath56 days per cycle .",

    "i have four eclipse times for the tail of the 2000 eruption .",
    "the three times on the late tail are consistent with the post - eruption ephemeris to within the intrinsic scatter . but",
    "the one eclipse time in the early tail comes 0.022 days ( 32 minutes or 0.037 in phase ) early .",
    "this offset is large , but the uncertainty is not small because no eclipse is visible ( see figure 8) .",

    "the linear model @xmath103 will be used for all calculations of o - c for u sco .",
    "the o - c curve displayed in figure 13 does not show any obvious curvature .",

    "the best fit parabola to the 29 eclipse times from 2001 - 2009 has a chi - square of 26.75 , which is only slightly better than a straight line .",

    "we see a strong roughly - linear trend , where the eclipses within 30 days of the peak ( i.e. , on the long plateau ) are _ early _ by up to 0.013 days ( 19 minutes ) , while the eclipses late in the tail are _ late _ by up to the same amount .",
    "this trend is highly significant ( although with substantial scatter ) , and is much larger than the uncertainty associated with the exact degree of curvature .    the orbital period of u sco can not change fast enough to explain the variations seen in figure 14 .",
    "so the explanation undoubtedly arises from a shift of the center of light in the u sco system as the eruption progresses .",
    "this is an expected result of changes in the relative brightness of the emission regions centered on the wd and those off the line connecting the stellar centers ( like from the hot spot and structure in the accreting material ) .",
    "i would hope that someone can construct a detailed model of the u sco eruption that reproduces and explains the variations shown in figure 14 .",
    "the large variations of eclipse times from the quiescent ephemeris means that these times should not be combined with the quiescent eclipse times .",
    "the deviations from zero in figure 14 are greatly larger than those in figure 13 . so any naive combination of quiescence and eruption times will be dominated by the offsets during the eruption , and any derived period changes ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",

    "the best @xmath1 value is positive , but the value is small and the uncertainty is such that it might be zero or even negative . the @xmath0 value is negative , which implies that the @xmath58 term is significant .",

    "the light curve might be poorly sampled by the standards of my modern time series photometry , but the data is more than good enough to show the existence of the eclipse and to determine the time of minimum to @xmath250.009 days .",
    "the eclipse is in the tail of an eruption , so it should suffer some systematic offset relative to an ephemeris for eclipses during quiescence .",
    "the eclipse minimum is from plates taken 34 days after the 1945 peak , so from figure 14 , we see that the offset should be near zero .",
    "the uncertainty in this zero offset is around @xmath250.005 days , with this being around half the size of the one - sigma error bar for the eclipse time .",

    "that is , the period from 2005 is close to the overall period going back in time . with the analysis from section 5.3 ,",
    "this means that the steady period change between eruption must closely balance out the abrupt period change for each eruption .",

    "are six huge sources of uncertainty :    \\(1 ) the @xmath169 depends critically on the temperature of the shell , which is only known approximately . even for the detailed physical analysis of the 1979 eruption of u sco ,",

    "( 1981 ) could only consider temperatures over the range of 10,000 to 25,000 , and the resulting shell masses varied by a factor of 1,500 .",

    "published values for @xmath177 range from @xmath1880.001 to 0.1 , but i see no reason to think that larger or smaller values are not unreasonable . even with this , we have an uncertainty of two orders of magnitude in @xmath177 and hence also in @xmath4 .",
    "\\(3 ) the nova distance enters in as a square , because we have to convert the observed line flux into a line luminosity . for expansion parallaxes ,",
    "wade et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that uncertainties related to the unknown shape of the ejecta will lead to errors by up to a factor of 2.5 , while they report further major problems with knowing what isophot to use , and knowing what velocity in the line profile ( e.g. , hwzi or hwhm ) matches to the selected isophot .",
    "for the particularly good case of rs oph , in light of these systematic problems with the expansion parallax , the real uncertainty in distance is over a factor of two ( schaefer 2009 ) .",
    "for distances based on the ` maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ' ( mmrd ) relation ( downes & duerbeck 2000 ) , the one - sigma scatter is 0.6 mag with greatest deviations of 1.6 mag , while even the different versions of the relation differ by up to 1.0 mag . it might be possible to improve the calibration of the mmrd by the use of extragalactic novae , for which the one - sigma scatter is roughly 0.3 mag with greatest deviations of 1.1 mag ( della valle & livio 1995 ) . however , kasliwal et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have gathered a new set of nova light curves ( with very high quality , deep limits , daily cadence , and spectral confirmations ) to demonstrate that the mmrd actually does _ not _ hold for extragalactic novae , as well as that the mmrd does not work either for recurrent novae or for detailed nova explosion models . in general , the distances to novae are only known to a factor of two or so , with the resulting distance uncertainty making for a @xmath374@xmath55 error in @xmath4 . in particular , ci aql has its best distance to be @xmath189 pc with a factor of two error , while u sco has the unique blackbody distance for its companion star allowed for by its total eclipse to be @xmath190 kpc ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the traditional method with line fluxes implicitly assumes that the shell is optically thin , so that we can see _ all _ the line photons being emitted .",
    "early during the eruption , the shell is certainly optically thick , and it becomes thin only after substantial expansion .",
    "we know in the case of u sco , that the inner binary is hidden behind an optically thick photosphere until about 13 days after the peak , when the eclipses suddenly start and when the supersoft source becomes first visible ( schlegel et al . 2010 ; schaefer et al .",
    "presumably , the outer volume of the shell can be optically thin , while the inner volume ( and the volume it shadows ) is not included in the mass estimate .",
    "all u sco estimates are made based on spectra from dates when the shell is still optically thick .",
    "a correction factor is needed , and this will be large when the nova is near peak and will then decrease to near unity as the eruption ends .",
    "i have seen no consideration or calculation of this correction factor in the literature .",
    "\\(5 ) the line flux scales as the square of the electron density for complete ionization , so the derived ejecta mass has a strong dependency on @xmath171 . in the literature",

    "the need to know the value of @xmath171 can be eliminated ( e.g. , banerjee et al . 2010 ) , but then the uncertainty is simply transfered to the filling factor , for which the uncertainty is still very large . in all , @xmath171 is uncertain by three orders of magnitude , with a corresponding error in @xmath4 .",
    "\\(6 ) the adopted volume of the shell scales as the cube of the expansion velocity , with @xmath179 taken from some emission line profile .",
    "however , there is no understanding of _ which _ velocity to take from the line profile so as to correlate with the outer edge of the shell .",
    "should we take the hwhm or the hwzi of the line profile , or some other velocity ?",
    "the line widths change substantially with time as the photosphere recedes , so should we take the line width at the nova peak , at the time of the observation , or at some other time ? for u sco , zwitter & munari ( 2000 ) gives the hwzi to vary as @xmath194 km s@xmath10 , while anupama & dewangan ( 2000 ) report hwzi values of 5065 and 3262 km s@xmath10 for @xmath180 values of 0.5 and 12 days .",
    "we also expect differences in velocity by perhaps a factor of 2.5 with the angle from the orbital pole due to bipolar ejection ( e.g. , walder et al . 2008 ) .",
    "all these problems certainly lead to errors in @xmath179 of a factor of @xmath1952 . with this ,",
    "the resulting error in @xmath4 will be a factor of @xmath1958 .",

    "the basic equation for conservative mass transfer ( where no mass is lost from the binary system ) is @xmath231 where the mass transfer rate ( @xmath11 ) is a positive quantity , @xmath232 is the total angular momentum in the system , and @xmath58 is the time derivative of @xmath232 ( frank et al .",
    "for the usual units of days , solar mass , solar mass , and solar mass per year , respectively , the unit of @xmath0 will be days per year . to get to days per cycle ( as in eq .",

    ", we have @xmath235 when @xmath236 . that is , when the wd is more massive than the companion star , the orbital period should be steadily increasing .",
    "the angular momentum of the system can not be increasing , so @xmath237 , so this can set an upper limit on @xmath0 , @xmath238 if the angular momentum loss is small then @xmath0 will be positive , otherwise @xmath0 can be negative .",
    "the size of @xmath58 can not now be known with any reliability , so all we really have is a _ limit _ on @xmath0 .    both u sco and ci aql",
    "have relatively steady accretion on the time scale of a century or so .",

    ". both of the stars are rne , so @xmath241 m@xmath6 and hence @xmath242 m@xmath6 .    the long term change in the orbital period will be the result of the steady change between eruptions punctuated by the abrupt change across each eruption . as used below",
    ", the base orbital period ( @xmath228 ) is the average period over the last decade . in the time interval from the last eruption until now",
    ", the period will be changing linearly with time , with @xmath228 corresponding to the period for a time near 2005 .",
    "below , i will be keeping track of time by means of a cycle count from the time of the eruption a decade ago ( in 2000 for ci aql and 1999 for u sco ) .",
    "the cycle count will be an integer , @xmath42 , that counts the cycles from that epoch .",
    "this cycle count up to the time of the average period ( around 2005 ) will be labeled @xmath243 . with this , the period across the last decade or so will be @xmath244 .",
    "just after the time of the previous eruption ( with @xmath245 ) , the period is @xmath246 .",
    "now we can consider the eruption in the preceding inter - eruption interval .",
    "( for u sco , this interval is from 1987 to 1999 . )",
    "just before the eruption , the orbital period is smaller by @xmath1 , so @xmath247 . for the time before this eruption ( as measured by the cycle",
    "count n , with @xmath248 ) , the period is @xmath249 .",
    "this inter - eruption interval is started at the time of the preceding eruption , with a cycle count of @xmath250 .",

    "we can generalize this to all earlier intervals as @xmath254 .",

    ", the @xmath256 term will be getting less negative . if @xmath235 , then the @xmath257 term will also be getting less negative as time increases . with this case , both steady period change and the mass ejection will work in the same direction , with the period secularly increasing . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath258 , then the period will alternatively increase across eruptions and decrease between eruptions .",
    "the long term trend will have the period being roughly constant for the case where @xmath259 , where @xmath133 is the average number of cycles between eruptions .",
    "a substantial problem with the idealization in the preceding paragraph is that the quiescent brightness of nova change on all time scales with surprisingly large amplitude ( e.g. , collazzi et al .",
    "2009 ; schaefer 2010 ; honeycutt et al . 1998",
    "; kafka & honeycutt 2004 ) .",
    "the brightness is largely a measure of the accretion rate and hence of the @xmath0 .",
    "so the @xmath0 is changing on all time scales with substantial amplitude . for recurrent novae in particular , schaefer ( 2005 ; 2010 ) and schaefer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have demonstrated that factor of two variations are common , and t pyx even has varied by a factor of @xmath260 over the last century .",
    "this allows and requires that the steady period changes vary across and within inter - eruption intervals . without having highly accurate measures with great coverage ,",
    "about all we can do is deal with the averages over whatever interval is in question .",
    "such averages should not be applied to other time intervals .    for ci aql , schaefer ( 2010 )",
    "has already pointed out that the quiescent brightness level has only small changes .",
    "this impies that ci aql should have only relatively small secular changes of @xmath0 .",
    "for u sco , schaefer ( 2005 ; 2010 ) and schaefer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have already pointed out that the accretion rate varies by up to factors of two .",
    "this implies that u sco should have substantial secular changes of @xmath0 .",
    "the o - c curve is a convenient and traditional means to represent deviations between observations ( ` @xmath261 ' ) and the model calculations ( ` @xmath262 ' ) . for a linear model with no period changes ,",
    "the ephemeris predicts that the time of minimum is @xmath263 , where @xmath82 is some epoch ( in hjd ) , @xmath42 is an integer that counts cycles from the epoch , and @xmath14 is the orbital period",
    ". the o - c simply equals @xmath264 .",
    "the o - c diagram is a plot of the observed o - c values as a function of the time .",
    "nonlinear models can be used in principle ( for example to remove some known effect ) , but for this paper i will use a linear model for constructing the o - c curve .",
    "if the observations perfectly followed the model , then o - c would be zero for all times . with the usual observational uncertainties and a perfect model , the values of o - c will scatter uniformly around the horizontal axis .",
    "if the epoch of the model is wrong , then the o - c values will follow a horizontal line that is offset from the horizontal axis by an amount that equals the error in @xmath82 .",
    "if the period of the model is wrong , then the plotted values will have a non - zero slope , a positive slope if the true period is longer than the model period , and a negative slope if the true period is shorter than the model period .",
    "if the orbital period changes uniformly , then the o - c curve will show a parabola .",
    "for the case where the orbital period decreases with a constant period derivative , the parabola will be concave down .",
    "for the case where the period undergoes a sudden change , then the o - c curve will show a broken line , with the kink at the time of the change and the before and after slopes appropriate for the periods .",
    "the larger the angle at the kink , the larger the period change .    for the case of a nova eruption that increases the orbital period and for a convention",
    "that the ( better measured ) post - eruption period is that used in the linear ephemeris , then the o - c curve should show the pre - eruption segment as a line falling with negative slope , touching the horizontal axis at the time of the eruption , then breaking to a horizontal line that follows the axis off to the right . with the reality that the binaries will suffer some small steady period change due to mass transfer , the simple broken line segment picture must be made more complex by having each of the line segments actually being a shallow parabola .",
    "the o - c curve will always be continuous , as any discontinuity could only be caused by the stars jumping forward in their orbit .",
    "the derivative of the o - c curve can change discontinuously with a sudden period change ( like when the nova blows of a shell ) , and indeed this is the very effect i am looking for .    to illustrate the o - c curves ,",
    "i have made some schematic plots .",
    "figure 17 shows the idealized case of a nova that erupts in 1999 for various values of @xmath1 for the case with @xmath65 .",
    "the linear ephemeris is from the best fit linear period after the eruption .",
    "the period before the eruption is shorter , so the o - c curve is a descending line segment which meets the post - eruption segment at the time of the eruption .",
    "the amount of the kink at the time of the eruption is determined by @xmath1 .",
    "the uppermost line is for the case of a large @xmath1 caused by a large @xmath4 , such that the wd is losing more mass each eruption than it gains between eruptions so that the wd is losing mass in the long term .",
    "( for an rn system , the implication is that the system then is _ not _ a type ia supernova progenitor . ) for rn systems , each will have some critical @xmath1 for which the wd is ( on average ) neither gaining nor losing mass , and this is illustrated by the middle line in figure 17 . for lines below this , those with a smaller - than - critical @xmath1 , the corresponding mass ejection is so small that the wd is _ gaining _ mass over each eruption cycle , and any rn system like that will inevitably have the wd rise to the chandrasekhar mass and become a type ia supernova . the various broken lines segments in figure 17 are the theoretical predictions for the various models as described .",
    "these predictions are to be compared against the actual eclipse times , which can be plotted as points with error bars on the same o - c diagram .",
    "this comparison can be made ( between theory and observation ) by means of the usual chi - square minimization , in this case so as to derive the best fit value for @xmath1 .",
    "to illustrate , simulated data points have been included in the left side of figure 17 , and we see that a small @xmath1 is indicated such that the system has its wd mass increasing . the right side of figure 17 illustrates the case where @xmath0 is substantially negative .",
    "the long term o - c diagram will depend on the interplay of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "figure 18 shows an illustrative o - c diagram for a case like u sco .",
    "each dashed vertical line indicates a known eruption , while the undoubted eruption around the year 1957 is also included for its @xmath1 even though no line is drawn for this event .",
    "the @xmath1 is held constant for all eruptions .",
    "the upper and the lower curves are for cases where @xmath0 is held constant , with the upper curve approximately satisfying the relation @xmath259 . the idealized case of constant @xmath0 is certainly wrong for novae and rne , with schaefer ( 2005 ; 2010 ) and schaefer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) demonstrating typical variations of a factor of two and extreme variations of a factor of 30 over a century . to illustrate how this might look",
    ", the middle curve in figure 18 shows a typical case where @xmath0 changes randomly between each eruption .",
    "the measured error bars of the eclipse times varies greatly . for ci aql",
    ", it varies from @xmath250.0001 day for a wonderfully observed full eclipse on the large mcdonald 2.1-m telescope all the way to @xmath250.0263 day for a single magnitude at the start of an ingress .",
    "this creates a visual perception problem in the display of the o - c points on a plot .",
    "the usual representation is to give all observed points the same size symbol and draw the one - sigma error bars .",
    "but the human eye tends to make judgments by the amount of black ink on a plot , so the worst measured points ( with large error bars ) are what define the judged curve and uncertainty regions , while the best observed points are overlooked due to their vanishing error bars . to avoid these inevitable perception problems ,",
    "i have presented each point with the size of the symbol and the prominence of the error bar scaling with the uncertainty .",
    "thus , the many highly accurate measures are plotted as large symbols ( with error bars that vanish under the symbol ) so that people can readily follow where the best fit lines should go and can readily see the scatter in the real data .",
    "the poor - accuracy measures are plotted as small symbols and thin error bars without the ending line segments , with this giving the correct visual impression that the these points have very low statistical weight . rather than make the symbol sizes adjusted for every measure , i have made four groups which share symbol size and error bar style .",

    "<S> i report on the cumulative results from a program started 24 years ago designed to measure the orbital period change of recurrent novae ( rne ) across an eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to use the orbital period change to measure the mass ejected during each eruption as the key part of trying to measure whether the rne white dwarfs are gaining or losing mass over an entire eruption cycle , and hence whether they can be progenitors for type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this program has now been completed for two eclipsing rne ; ci aquilae ( ci aql ) across its eruption in 2000 and u scorpii ( u sco ) across its eruption in 1999 . for ci aql , </S>",
    "<S> i present 78 eclipse times from 1991 - 2009 ( including four during the tail of the 2000 eruption ) plus two eclipses from 1926 and 1935 . for u sco , </S>",
    "<S> i present 67 eclipse times , including 46 times during quiescence from 1989 - 2009 , plus 21 eclipse times in the tails of the 1945 , 1999 , and 2010 eruptions . </S>",
    "<S> the eclipse times during the tails of eruptions are systematically and substantially shifted with respect to the ephemerides from the eclipses in quiescence , with this being caused by shifts of the center of light during the eruption . </S>",
    "<S> these eclipse times are plotted on an o - c diagram and fitted to models with a steady period change ( @xmath0 ) between eruptions ( caused by , for example , conservative mass transfer ) plus an abrupt period change ( @xmath1 ) at the time of eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the primary uncertainty arises from the correlation between @xmath1 with @xmath0 , such that a more negative @xmath0 makes for a more positive @xmath1 . for ci aql , </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is @xmath2 . for u sco , </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is @xmath3 days . </S>",
    "<S> these period changes can directly give a dynamical measure of the mass ejected ( @xmath4 ) during each eruption with negligible sensitivity to the stellar masses and no uncertainty from distances . </S>",
    "<S> for ci aql , the one - sigma upper limit is @xmath5 m@xmath6 . for u sco , </S>",
