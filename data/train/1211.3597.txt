    "should be mentioned .",
    "if the spin - nuclear coupling strength is weak enough and the relaxation of the nuclear bath is fast , then the nuclear dynamics effects can be reduced to a fast random field @xcite . in the opposite situation , if the nuclear subsystem is slow enough compared to the characteristic tunnel time , its influence on lz transition can be accounted by an effective model of a slow classical noise@xcite . for the simplest lz scenario ,",
    "the nuclear dynamics can be considered in the born - oppenheimer approximation , so that the spins are presumed isolated and transitions are activated by an external magnetic field .",
    "besides , the noise associated with both hyperfine and dipole fields plays an important role in the description of dynamical response of nanomagnets@xcite .",

    "it might serve for transfer of population between two states at any time @xmath107 .",
    "for instance by measuring the lz transition probability between two states , it provides information about the strength @xmath20 of the coupling between states .",
    "it could also offer great advantages in experiments with atoms transfer , having only one parameter for control .    in the domain @xmath108 ,",
    "the projection of bloch s vector on @xmath60-axis is positive .",
    "the system remains in the state where it has been set initially .",

    "one also needs to define a tunnel time@xcite in order to put a borderline between two cases when the consequent tunnel processes can or can not be considered independently .",
    "there exist several ways to define the tunnel landau - zener time for two level system .",
    "although we are not going to dwell onto a detailed discussion of tunnel times in this paper , let us list a few physical definitions .",
    "one possible approach is the so - called `` internal clock '' definition .",
    "it is based on analysis of lz probability behavior at finite times .",
    "as it has been pointed out several times along our discussion , the finite time probability dynamics is characterized by monotonous function for slow adiabatic passage , while for sudden ( rapid ) transition it oscillates before saturation at constant value .",
    "these oscillations correspond to interference processes and determine the population of two states .",
    "therefore , the `` internal clock '' approach defines the landau - zener time as the width of transition to its asymptotic value ( see refs . [ ] for detailed discussion ) .",
    "an alternative approach to a definition of lz times is based on `` external clock '' probe . in that case , the lz hamiltonian is perturbed by a periodic transverse field @xmath402 , where , @xmath403 is the frequency of the field and @xmath404 is its initial phase .",
    "the lz time is determined through analysis of infinite time probability as a function of external field frequency ( see details in ref . )    both definitions consistently lead to estimation of lz times as @xmath405 for slow adiabatic passage and @xmath406 for rapid passage .",
    "obviously , both definitions can be straightforwardly generalized for multi - level lz transitions .",
    "let us consider a slow noise as a special case of `` external clock '' .",
    "we add a perturbation @xmath407 to the system such that the coupling @xmath20 is deviated as @xmath408 .",
    "this case has been discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sec3.2.1 ] and corresponds to a non - centered one - component transverse noise .",
    "the role of noise is to frustrate the spins in the direction of the zeeman field .",
    "let us consider a square fluctuation of the bloch s vector as a probe for lz time : @xmath409 since the classical noise only dephases the system and does not create any dissipation in it , the condition @xmath410 holds . in general , @xmath411 mixes the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the density matrix but for the two- and three- level systems subject to classical transverse noise we consider thus far , @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",
    "thus we write , @xmath414 the subscript @xmath415 refers as usual to slow noise .",
    "it should however be noted that relation ( [ equ88 ] ) works both for two- and three- level systems under the assumption that the system initially prepared in one of the ( upper or lower ) diabatic states .    with these ideas in mind",
    ", we check the numerical behavior of @xmath411 for these initial conditions of the spin .",
    "essential results are depicted by fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "interestingly , @xmath411 abruptly increases around the anticrossing region and saturates to its top value , confirming a spin flip transition . after the transition ,",
    "the variance slightly fluctuates ( slight decay of @xmath411 ) in the direction of the zeeman field for adiabatic addition of noise ( see figs.[fig14b ] ) : @xmath416 the two- and three- level systems , seem no longer sensitive to any addition of noise from certain value of @xmath417 states are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the transition time may then be defined as the particular moment when the square fluctuation of the bloch s vector achieved its maximum value .",
    "this qualitative definition can be experimentally probed . for the physical realization of this condition",
    ", we pose that @xmath411 is a function of the variable @xmath418 .",
    "then , the latter behaves as the quadratic function @xmath419 defined in the real space .",
    "the mathematical requirement for a maximum of a function yields @xmath420 this definition actually coincides with the half - width condition @xmath421 , where @xmath422 is the maximum value of probability . we emphasize in addition that the definition ( [ equ90 ] ) holds both for two- and three- level systems .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the effects of a transverse colored noise on both two and three - level systems subject to lz transitions . the approximate solution for the traditional lz problem",
    "is written down in terms of fresnel s integrals and appears to be useful for exploring the effects of slow noise at finite times .",
    "we demonstrated in the framework of von - neumann equation that the effects of noise on a two - level system were regulated by an integral - differential master equation of the form ( [ equ15 ] ) .",
    "we showed that for a fast gaussian noise it is sufficient to average that equation while for the slow noise , a correct procedure is based on averaging the solutions over the gaussian realization of the noise .",
    "these arguments have been found to be general for the description of multilevel systems where complicated interference patterns are expected .",
    "the solution of bloch s equation is generalized for the finite - time lz probabilities of two - and three- level system models in the presence of slow noise .",
    "we have essentially shown that for any initial preparation of noise along one of transverse directions ( @xmath157-noise ) or two - component transverse noise ( @xmath158-noise ) the probability is renormalized by new functions with shapes of standard lz curves .",
    "the famous frequent exponentials appearing in lz transition probabilities are considerably discriminated by an inverse square - root function of @xmath423 .    in the absence of noise",
    ", we showed that population difference for two- and three- level systems can be found as a solution of a third - order linear differential equation .",
    "the solution of this equation is given in terms of products of the parabolic cylinder weber s functions .",
    "we investigated solutions by evoking an isomorphism between schrdinger s and bloch s pictures . in the presence of noise in general ,",
    "the equations for density matrix elements are integral - differential equations .",
    "their solutions can be found through the averaging procedure discussed in the paper .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to mention various realization of two- and three- level landau - zener transitions in recent quantum transport experiments @xcite .",
    "the two - electron spin quantum bits are manipulated by the gate voltage applied to gaas double quantum dot in the presence of external transverse magnetic field .",
    "the low - energy two - electron states in a double quantum well are given by three singlet and one triplet states .",
    "while the singlet states are not affected by the external magnetic field , the degeneracy of the triplet state is lifted out by the external zeeman field .",
    "in addition , there is a fluctuating overhauser s field appearing due to a hyperfine interaction of electrons and nuclear magnetic field of ga and as sublattices of a host material . on one hand ,",
    "the slowly fluctuating overhauser s field is known to be responsible for both decoherence and dephasing @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the double dot is not symmetric , the hyperfine magnetic field can result in transitions between singlet and triplet states .",
    "therefore , in addition to three singlet states which form a three - level system , one of the triplet component should also be taken into account .",
    "moreover , the transition between the singlet and triplet states provides a mechanism of nuclear spin polarization and effective cooling the nuclear subsystem .",
    "thus , the overhauser s field leads to two competing effects of both nuclear polarization and depolarization due to relaxation and dephasing .",
    "the model we discuss in the paper does not account for the effects of relaxation only addressing the question of dephasing by classical fast- and slow gaussian noises .",
    "nevertheless , the competition between the polarizing ( due to two- and three- state transitions ) and depolarizing ( due to the dephasing ) effects is fully taken into account .",
    "the suppression of the lz transition by the overhauser s field fluctuations characterizes the effective temperature associated with noise and can give a qualitative explanation for the nuclear spin depolarization mechanism .",
    "the integral - differential equation for conventional lz problem ( [ equ16 ] ) in the absence of noise can be solved iteratively by setting the perturbative series expansion of @xmath109 via the parameter @xmath424 : @xmath425 where @xmath426 and , @xmath427\\times ... \\\\ ... \\times\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\tau_{2k-2}}d\\tau_{2k-1}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\tau_{2k-1}}d\\tau_{2k}\\cos [ \\tau_{2k-1}^{2}-\\tau_{2k}^{2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see ref . for details of calculation of sophisticated multiple integrals ( [ equ98 ] ) appearing in a classical - mechanical problem of a ball rolling on a cornu spiral . )    in the presence of noise , we do @xmath428 in eq.([equ97 ] ) and the function @xmath429 is modified @xmath430 :    @xmath431\\times ... \\\\\\nonumber ...",

    "calculations for a one - component transverse noise lead to the kayanuma result@xcite ( @xmath185 ) : @xmath438 while for the two - component transverse noise ( @xmath158-noise ) @xmath439 for slow or fast noise , we do respectively @xmath440 and the former time - dependent function ( [ equ100 ] ) turns out to be a simple combinatorial factor .",
    "the long - time asymptotic value of @xmath429 becomes @xmath441 this helps to find ( [ equ7 ] ) in a perturbative expansion : @xmath442 here , @xmath443 and the radius of convergence for eq.([equa104 ] ) equals infinity .",
    "considering the limit of slow or fast noise , the probability ( [ equa104 ] ) is modified by a coefficient in the perturbative expansion .",
    "we write the solution of the integral equation ( [ equ24 ] ) for the cases of slow and fast noise driven lz transition as @xmath444 where @xmath445 are the combinatorial factors that appear after averaging over noise realization and depend on either fast or slow noise .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "that for slow noise , the combinatorial factor @xmath445 is expressed as : @xmath446 for an @xmath157-noise model and @xmath447 for an @xmath158-noise one .",
    "the case of fast noise is completely different .",
    "in contrast with the slow noise , as shown in ref . only a single term out of the @xmath448 pairings in eq.([equ100 ] ) contributes to the summation for an x- noise :    @xmath449    for an @xmath158- model , noise contributes as @xmath450    equation ( [ equa105 ] ) can be viewed as a result of averaging the lz probability over disorder noise realizations ( the exponential function in lz probability containing the fluctuating field is an ensemble average ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the fast noise case for which the argument of exponential function in the lz probability is proportional to  two - point noise correlation function  ( the argument is disorder average ) .",
    "moreover , the statement concerning disorder averaging remains true for any finite time transition probability .",
    "therefore , the same time dependent function @xmath451 will enter the equation for the finite time slow noise driven lz transition . since the coefficient @xmath445 strongly depends on @xmath452 , the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion",
    "must also be found . after summing up the perturbative series for the lz probability within the circle of convergence ,",
    "the function has to be analytically continued into the outer part of the circle .",
    "we will identify analytical functions describing slow noise driven lz probability and consider finite time lz transition .",
    "proceeding , with @xmath445 in eqs.([equa106])-([equa109 ] ) we will recover exactly all the lz probabilities found previously .",
    "the equation of motion for the density matrix describing transitions in three - level systems can be obtained in the same way as we discussed in details earlier for @xmath2 . in this appendix",
