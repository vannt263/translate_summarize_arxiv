    "w49 is a strong radio continuum source initially discovered by @xcite in his 22  cm survey .",
    "it was subsequently found to be resolved into two components , a thermal source , w49a , to the west and a non - thermal source , w49b , @xmath5 to the east @xcite .",
    "the latter is a sn remnant .",
    "w49a ( @xmath6 g43.2 + 0.0 ) is a giant h  ii ( gh  ii ) region and one of the most luminous in our galaxy ( e.g. , smith et al . 1978 ) . given its location in the plane of the milky way and distance of @xmath7 kpc @xcite , w49a is obscured optically by intervening ( and local ) interstellar dust .",
    "it has been the subject of numerous investigations in radio and infra - red ( ir ) wavelengths , which we shall now briefly review .",
    "@xcite found w49a to have two thermal components , one , a2 , made up of of small size ( 1 pc ) and high density ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) components , embedded in another , a1 , of larger diameter ( 14 pc ) and low density ( @xmath11@xmath10 ) . in a remarkably prescient suggestion , they pointed out that the high density ( a2 ) sources might surround o stars still embedded in their ionized dust cocoons as had been predicted on general principles by @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies at multiple radio wavelengths and higher spatial resolution by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and others have identified individual point - like and spatially extended sources ( h  ii regions ) within w49a .",
    "the former are interpreted as ultra  compact  h  ii ( uch  ii ) regions ( e.g. , wood & churchwell 1989a ) , some of which are found in a ring  like structure @xcite that may be rotating .",
    "this cluster of uch  ii regions is within a larger radio structure labeled w49n ; a separate cometary uch  ii source , w49s , is @xmath12 distant and not considered further here . the high density ( a2 ) sources proposed by mezger et al .",
    "may be identified with the uch  ii regions and their a1 source with w49n itself .",
    "the labeling of the individual sources follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are roughly 30 radio point sources in the central w49a region corresponding to about that number of ob stars . in the entire w49a region",
    "there are about @xmath1 lyc photons emitted per sec ( from smith et al .",
    "1978 , modified to the new distance of gwinn et al . 1992 ) , or about 100 o star `` equivalents '' ( o7v * : vacca 1994 ) .",
    "thus roughly one - third of the excitation of the w49a region is accounted for by the uch  ii sources in the central cluster and two - thirds must come from elsewhere ( including w49s ) .",
    "associated with these hot stars must be thousands of lower mass objects ( not yet detected or possibly not yet formed ) .",
    "most gh  ii regions in our galaxy are , like w49a , optically obscured by dust in the milky way ( a notable exception is ngc  3603 ; e.g , drissen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "near ir observations ( e.g. , in the @xmath2band at 2.2  @xmath13 ) have the potential to penetrate dust ( since @xmath14 is @xmath0  0.1 @xmath15 ) , enabling one to identify and classify the o type stars exciting the h  ii regions following @xcite . @xcite",
    "have begun a program to study gh  ii regions in the near ir , using @xmath16 imaging photometry to select the candidate exciting stars and @xmath2band spectroscopy to classify them .",
    "some twenty bright galactic sources from the h  ii and gh  ii compilation of @xcite were initially selected , and @xmath2band photometry has been obtained for eight of them ( four others have data from the literature ) .",
    "all of these sources , aside from w49a , show the presence of a stellar cluster in the @xmath2band at the radio source position . in w49a",
    ", there is no central ( @xmath2band ) cluster ; the `` ring '' of uch  ii regions observed in the radio assumes that role .",
    "the purpose of this article is to discuss the status of the newly born massive stars within the cluster / association represented by w49a .",
    "a brief summary of the properties of uch  ii regions is given in  2 .",
    "we present new @xmath2band imaging of w49a and contrast it with existing high spatial resolution radio maps of the region in  3 .",
    "emission nebulae and their possible exciting stars are visible in the @xmath2band image in the outer fringes of w49a but aside from two point sources , the stars of the central cluster of uch  ii regions are not .",
    "an interpretation of w49a as a newly born cluster in which the stars are still embedded in their birth cocoons but in different stages of emergence is given in  4 .",
    "a connection to the recently discovered ultra - dense  h  ii ( udh  ii ) regions in m  33 and other galaxies @xcite is provided in  5 and a summary of cluster starbirth phenomena follows in  6 .",
    "we will first briefly review the properties of uch  ii regions , mostly following @xcite .",
    "the candidate objects are typically initially identified from radio wavelength observations as thermal free  free sources .",
    "the radio radiation comes from a very compact (  0.1 pc ) , but dense ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) , h  ii region surrounding a newly born ob star .",
    "uch  ii regions all radiate strongly in ir wavelengths from their extensive heated dust cocoons .",
    "iras satellite measurements were used by @xcite to elucidate the properties of 75 galactic sources . while the field uch  ii regions",
    "are typically excited by a single ob star , there is evidence that other lower mass `` companions '' or small clusters are present also @xcite .",
    "the radio radiation is typically , but not always , optically thick longward of 6 cm wavelengths ( positive slope @xmath17 where the flux @xmath18 ) . using the list of galactic uch  ii sources in wood & churchwell that have their measured radio wavelengths ( e.g. , 6 and 2  cm ) we find that roughly 20% are optically thin ( 5 out of 24 sources ) , the rest are optically thick .",
    "spherically symmetric models of uch  ii regions have been constructed by @xcite . immediately surrounding",
    "the star is a small , low density but very hot central `` cavity '' which underlays the denser ionized shell , or h  ii region , according to these models .",
    "this material is surrounded by a thin , very dense neutral shock containing dust and gas . outside this region",
    "is the large , warm dust cocoon , the source of the thermal emission , and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the dust volume temperature is not single valued as it is distributed over a large volume of space surrounding the star .",
    "this material will radiate strongly in the sub - mm and mid - ir regions with a maximum near @xmath19 m from a mean t @xmath20k . as most of the dust cocoon is at temperatures less than @xmath21k",
    ", only a minor fraction of the overall thermal emission will be found shortwards of @xmath22 m . at near ir wavelengths ( @xmath23 m )",
    "no thermal emission would be expected from the dust cocoon .",
    "in addition to radiating at wavelengths characteristic of its temperature distribution , the dust has a wavelength dependent opacity that affects the emergent light of the underlying star .",
    "the uch  ii region dust opacity is very high in the visible with a transition to the optically thin case somewhere in near ir wavelengths ( shorter than @xmath24 m according to the models of churchwell et al .",
    "a survey of 63 radio selected galactic uch  ii regions was carried out by @xcite using @xmath25band photometry and @xmath2band spectroscopy .",
    "roughly 50% of their objects showed evidence of extended nebular br@xmath4 emission or had candidate hot stellar sources visible in the @xmath25band .",
    "@xcite , using a smaller sample of southern uch  ii regions , detected central stars in 66% of them in the near ir .",
    "using a sample of iras sources color selected to be uch  ii regions ( _ i.e. , candidates _ ) , @xcite detected ob stars in one - third and `` emission - line '' stars in another one - third .",
    "the others had only foreground stars in the field . for actual uch  ii regions the observations thus seem to suggest that _ half _ of the exciting objects will be visible at @xmath23 m .",
    "there may be a further complication affecting the observational properties of uch  ii regions and their exciting stars if a disc is present ( e.g. , garay & lizano 1999 ) .",
    "this material will likely be sufficiently close to the star and its temperature hot enough to radiate in the @xmath2band .",
    "this radiation could swamp the stellar continuum , obliterating any stellar spectroscopic signatures at this wavelength .",
    "this condition may initially be detected with accurate @xmath16 photometry as hot stars with excess @xmath2band emission will appear to be too `` red '' in the classic @xmath26 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath27 color - color diagram .",
    "a residual disc geometry seems to be present for a number of very young ( yso candidate ) late o / early b type stars in m17 @xcite .",
    "these stars have anomalous @xmath26 _ vs. _ @xmath27 colors . with the exception of br@xmath4 emission ,",
    "their @xmath2band spectra are otherwise featureless ( or have co emission lines ) .",
    "the interstellar extinction towards m17 is sufficiently low that far - red and blue spectra were able to be obtained .",
    "there the disc emission becomes less prominent and underlying stellar absorption features are seen , although they appear `` veiled '' .",
    "furthermore , some hydrogen emission lines are seen to be double peaked , a nearly certain indication of a disc morphology .",
    "infall or outflow from these discs is not yet established , nor can such motion be ruled out .",
    "most of the stars with discs could be classified as late o or early b type . in this cluster",
    ", the earliest type o stars do not show any evidence of discs .",
    "this could merely reflect a time scale issue : for example , the disc dissipation could depend inversely on the mass such that the most massive stars in m17 have already lost their discs .",
    "anomalous @xmath16 colors and , in some cases `` featureless '' @xmath2band spectra with br@xmath4 emission were found for several stars we have studied in the gh  ii regions w43 , w42 and w31 @xcite . given near ir properties similar to those found for the stars of m17 ,",
    "these objects are believed to harbor remnant stellar discs .",
    "several ob stars with @xmath2band photometric or spectroscopic evidence of discs appear to excite uch  ii regions in w31 . in at least two field",
    "galactic uch  ii regions , g29.96 + 0.6 ( watson & hanson 1997 ) and g23.96 + 0.15 ( hanson et al . 2001 ) , photospheric lines from the central exciting o stars are clearly visible in the @xmath2band and are classifiable .",
    "in a few other cases , hanson et al . find exciting stars with featureless spectra , which again is consistent with veiling by a hot circumstellar material as if they have stellar discs .",
    "additional work in this area is clearly needed .",
    "discs are visible in _ some _ hot luminous stars well after the cocoons have been evaporated .",
    "it seems obvious that if discs are present after the end of the cocoon phase , _ they must have been present throughout it_. this follows logically since the initial stages of massive star birth necessarily involve a massive accretion disc .",
    "evidence for disc morphology in this precursor `` hot core '' phase has been given by @xcite .",
    "it is hard to imagine a reason for this disc to disappear for awhile and then another one to reappear near the end of the birth processes .",
    "it is not impossible that all massive stars have discs during their initial birth processes and this morphology persists , at least for some of them , to beyond the uch  ii phase .",
    "most , if not all , might have discs during the entire uch  ii lifetime .",
    "models of a such `` photo - evaporative '' discs have been promoted by @xcite .    in m17",
    "some late o / early b type stars have discs , but others do not .",
    "this distinction can not be related to the final stellar mass .",
    "a highly speculative notion is to imagine that the late retention of remnant discs is somehow related to whether or not a star is binary or single .",
    "radial velocity studies of the binary frequency of the ob stars in m17 are currently underway by psc and other of his colleagues to address this issue .",
    "figure  [ radio ] shows a 3.6  cm radio grayscale map of the w49a region , which we have adapted from the data presented by @xcite .",
    "the uch  ii point sources identified with letters by @xcite are concentrated in the center of the w49a region ; given their number they might be thought of as a cluster of ob stars ( dreher et al . ) . towards the sw and nw of the central cluster",
    "are extended ( `` resolved '' ) radio sources which have been labeled by @xcite .",
    "these are more properly thought of as h  ii , or compact h  ii , regions .",
    "east of the cluster is amorphous and extended radio emission , not all of which has been labeled by radio astronomers .      using the blanco 4-m telescope and facility ir imager , osiris , at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) , we have obtained the @xmath2band image of the w49a region shown in figure  [ kband ] .",
    "the data taking and reduction are completely analogous to that for the images described by @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained on the night of 20 may 2000 along with a similar @xmath25band image .",
    "the total integration time was 225 seconds at @xmath28 and 350 seconds at @xmath29 .",
    "the data were obtained through thin cirrus .",
    "a photometric calibration was obtained on 11 july 2001 at the blanco 4-m , again with osiris .",
    "the short exposures of w49 were calibrated using the standard star gspc  s808-c ( also known as [ pmk98 ] 9178 ) from @xcite .",
    "photometry through 15 pixel radius apertures was used to set the zero point of the 2001 images using four relatively bright and uncrowded stars at @xmath28 and five at @xmath29 .",
    "the same stars were then compared to the 2000 data to flux calibrate the deeper images .",
    "the uncertainty in the transformation for the deep images is taken as the standard deviation in the mean of the four stars at @xmath28 and five at @xmath29 and was 0.027 @xmath30 and 0.026 @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2band filter includes contributions from nebular , presumably predominantly br@xmath4 , emission .",
    "there is no cluster visible in the @xmath2band image at the position of the uch  ii regions , nor is any extended nebular contribution seen there .",
    "some combination of the dust of the individual cocoons and that within the cluster is optically thick in the @xmath2band so the stellar light is totally absorbed .",
    "this cocoon material must also be insufficiently hot to provide any thermal emission at @xmath3 m ir wavelengths .",
    "however , point sources f and j2 are clearly detected in the @xmath2band image ( see also below ) .",
    "there is a connection between several of the outlying h  ii regions of figure  [ radio ] and similar emission structure in figure  [ kband ] .",
    "sources q and s to the sw are clearly visible as bright extended objects , as is the fainter object dd to the nw . towards the east",
    "a number of stellar images seem to be associated with the extended br@xmath4 and radio emission .",
    "it appears that while the central stars of w49a are nearly all optically thick to @xmath2band radiation , in the periphery the extinction is much less and the h  ii regions and candidate exciting stars may be seen .",
    "the @xmath28 vs. @xmath27 color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the photometry was obtained using the point ",
    " function ( psf ) fitting program dophot @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are a combination of the psf fitting error plus the calibration uncertainty described above added in quadrature .",
    "there is strong differential reddening evident in figure  [ cmd ] , but a foreground sequence is seen at the bluest colors .",
    "a broad intermediate sequence is seen at colors between about 0.5 and 1.0 magnitudes corresponding to 1 @xmath14 1.5 mag using the interstellar extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "a number of @xmath2band sources fall in this range , and we believe they are candidate ob stars that have sufficiently shed their natal material and may now be ionizing the peripheral hii regions in w49a . following iau convention , we designate these nine new sources as w49:cb01  1  to  9 .",
    "hereafter , ( e.g. figures  [ kband ] and [ cmd ] ) we refer to them as sources `` 19 . ''",
    "if these are early o - type stars , their @xmath14 and @xmath2band magnitudes put them near to the canonical 11.4 kpc distance of w49a .    in figure",
    "[ over ] we have plotted the radio contour overlay on the @xmath2band image .",
    "point radio sources f and j2 are coincident with @xmath2band images .",
    "object f is extremely red in @xmath27 and j2 is somewhat red compared to the main body of stars with @xmath27 between 0.5 and 1 .",
    "source 2 is also very red but it is not a radio source .",
    "the @xmath2band magnitude of object f might be anomalously bright if it has a reprocessing circumstellar disc . following @xcite , the maximum @xmath31 is 0.5 and @xmath32 is 4.0 for an o star excited disc viewed face on ( their table 4 ) .",
    "then from figure  [ cmd ] the stellar @xmath27 of f 3 and @xmath14 4.8 .",
    "a careful perusal of figure  [ over ] reveals that the rest of the uch  ii `` ring '' sources are not detected in the @xmath2band .",
    "a conservative estimate is that their @xmath2band magnitudes must be fainter than 18 . for the canonical dm of 15.3 and adopting a zams @xmath33 of -4.8 ( type o3 ) for the brightest stars we have @xmath14 7.5 for the central cluster .    our own unpublished spectra of sources f and j2 from a recent kitt peak run ( principal investigator dr .",
    "jeff goldader ) , which will be presented in a forthcoming article , suggest both stars are `` featureless '' in the @xmath2band , with the exception of nebular ( or circumstellar ) br@xmath4 emission .",
    "( given that neither object has stellar co absorption features we can immediately conclude that they are not k or m stars in the foreground . )",
    "the description of the spectra is similar to that found for the brightest star ( #  1 ) in w31 @xcite , which is also the exciting star for an uch  ii region .",
    "again we have the situation in which there is evidence consistent with a disc and a dust cocoon that is optically thin at @xmath3 m .",
    "the diffuse radio source p ( to the se ) is also extended , or nebular , in the @xmath2band image .",
    "we plan to obtain @xmath2band spectra of the candidate exciting stars with our colleagues in brazil in the near future .",
    "this should enable us to classify the exciting stars and potentially to ascertain their ages and use them for an accurate spectrophotometric distance determination to w49a as we have done previously in w43 , w42 , and w31 @xcite .",
    "relatively high spatial resolution 1020  @xmath13 m imaging of w49a has recently been reported by @xcite . at these wavelengths",
    "one is measuring the re  radiated stellar energy from the warm dust surrounding the stars .",
    "many of the radio continuum sources were detected , as would be expected if there were luminous stars buried within their cocoons .",
    "the thermal ir point sources detected included f , g ( which is multiple ) , i , j , j2 , l , m , r and s ; sources h , j1 and k were not detected shortward of 20  @xmath13 m .",
    "a number of extended sources ( mostly with double letters - @xcite ) were also detected at 10 - 20  @xmath13 m .    however , the western most sources , a , b , c , c1 , d and e , were not detected at 20  @xmath13 m or shorter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite interpret these stars as lying behind a very opaque local dust cloud blocking our line of sight , such that even the short wavelength mid ir emitted by the dust of the individual uch  ii regions is absorbed .",
    "given their location together on the west side of the `` ring '' , this possibility seems reasonable .",
    "the non - detection of these sources in the @xmath2band is then predictable .",
    "following the @xcite estimate that the local cloud reduces the 20@xmath13 m flux by a least a factor 5 , then we have @xmath34 , according to @xcite , and @xmath14 8.9 .",
    "this estimated extinction for the western `` ring '' sources is somewhat larger than our lower limit ( @xmath14 7.5 ) derived above for the non - detection of any of the `` ring '' ( aside from f ) , which makes sense .",
    "for an individual uch  ii region the surrounding gas and the dust should be evolving on relatively rapid time scales as the ionized gas volume is expanding and the dust is being evaporated and dissipated by the exciting star .",
    "stellar winds will play a role too . @xcite give statistical arguments based upon their number counts of uch  ii regions and those of ob stars in the galaxy that suggest the ages of the former are 10 - 20 % of the main sequence lifetime .",
    "thus the cocoon stages could last up to 2 million years .",
    "it is well known that such lifetimes are much larger than simple dynamical arguments would suggest but a consensus explanation for this discrepancy is not yet available . in any case ,",
    "given that there is an uch  ii region , the underlying star must be hot and already in the main sequence hydrogen - burning phase .    even after the buried star has begun its initial main sequence evolution it may continue to retain a disc .",
    "it was argued above (  2.2 ) that an inner disc may be present _ throughout _ the cocoon phase ; such a disc is likely to be `` photo - evaporative '' @xcite .",
    "the existence of this disc and the complications arising from its evolution and eventual destruction via dissipation and/or accretion to the star might well substantially lengthen the uch  ii phase ( welch 1993 ) .",
    "a full radiative hydrodynamical treatment of the non - spherically symmetric and inhomogeneous dust and gas surrounding a massive star at this phase of its evolution is still well beyond current understanding . in any case , with time the densities of the gas and of the dust will rapidly diminish , probably with different time scales . while the physical conditions of these materials are related , their optical and geometrical depths may not be closely coupled . as the cocoon is being dissipated , its optically thin transition point will begin to shift , and the star will be seen to `` emerge '' from its birth place at progressively shorter near ir wavelengths . similarly , the inner ionized hydrogen region will expand , becoming first optically thin and eventually transitioning to a `` compact '' and eventual `` classical '' h  ii radio source .",
    "what do we observe in w49a ?",
    "let us initially set aside the central sources a , b , c , c1 , d , and e , for which there is no mid  ir wavelength thermal emission because of the high opacity of a localized dust cloud ( and no @xmath2band emission either for the same reason ) .",
    "for the remaining uch  ii regions , there are then two subsets as characterized by their near ir properties . in the first of these ,",
    "the warm dust cocoons emit thermal ir radiation but they remain opaque at 2.2  @xmath13 m . the accretion disc is buried within the cocoon and not observed ( even though it may be hot enough to emit in the @xmath2 band ) . in the central cluster of w49a",
    ", there are eight examples of these uch  ii sources : five in g , i , j , & m. in the second subset of uch  ii regions , thermal _ and _ @xmath2 band emission from the central object is found .",
    "this is the situation for sources f & j2 , in the central cluster . in f & j2 ,",
    "the @xmath2band spectrum is featureless but with nebular ( circumstellar ? ) emission lines . in these stars ,",
    "the cocoon has become transparent down to the central object whose putative disc radiates in the @xmath2band .",
    "the fraction in each phase is consistent ( given the very small numbers here ) with the 50% statistics of @xmath2band detection of the central objects from @xcite for the field galactic uch  ii regions .",
    "these sources are illuminating uch  ii regions , so that while the stars are beginning to `` emerge '' from the cocoons , their ionized hydrogen region remains tightly bounded .",
    "@xcite have obtained multiwavelength vla and bima observations of several of the point sources within the central cluster .",
    "it is interesting that sources c , d , and f have `` flat '' spectral indices ( @xmath17 ) between 1.3 cm and 3.3 mm while a , b1 , b2 , g1 , g2a and g2b are `` rising '' .",
    "these are the optically `` thin '' and `` thick '' cases for the free - free radio emission , respectively . given that f is detected in the @xmath2band , and its radio emission is also optically thin , it is tempting to suggest that perhaps sources c and d would also be visible in the @xmath2band . unfortunately , they remain buried in the intense local dust cloud on the west side of the ring .",
    "finally there are the hot star candidates in the periphery of the cluster that are associated with h  ii , rather than uch  ii , regions .",
    "the ionized surroundings of these stars are no longer physically constrained by the overlying dust cocoons , which have now dissipated .",
    "there may still be remnant discs , as with some of the stars in m17 , but the ultra compact h  ii regions are no more .",
    "@xmath2band spectroscopy is now needed to ascertain the spectral types and to determine the presence or absence of discs .",
    "on the basis of the lack of uch  ii regions here , as compared to the center , we might suggest that star formation began in the periphery . alternatively , the lifetime of the uch  ii / cocoon stages might be shorter in a less dense external interstellar environment .",
    "@xcite have discovered compact thermal radio sources in the nearby galaxies m33 , ngc  253 , and ngc  6946 from an examination of papers in the literature that surveyed these galaxies for snr .",
    "( snr show non  thermal radio continua , so they are easy to disentangle from other sources . )",
    "the listed thermal sources , which are also optically thick in cm wavelengths , emit a number of lyman continuum photons equivalent to between a few and a few hundred o stars .",
    "an examination of the corresponding optical fields shows little or no visible radiation at the positions of half of the radio sources ; in most of the other half , the stellar contributions are insufficient to account for the implied numbers of o type stars .",
    "these udh  ii sources are scaled up in radio luminosity from the ( mostly single star excited ) field uch  ii regions in our galaxy . @xcite",
    "suggest these objects to be buried open clusters and associations .",
    "w49a can be considered to be one of this class of object , a newly born counterpart of luminous optically visible gh  ii regions such as ngc  604 in m33 .",
    "these buried objects should also be strong thermal ir emitters , as are the uch  ii regions in w49a .",
    "their visibility in the k - band will give clues about the extent to which the cluster has begun to emerge from the natal dust .",
    "near ir imaging of the galactic gh  ii region w49a has been presented .",
    "most of the components of the previously known cluster of uch  ii regions are invisible at these wavelengths .",
    "the cocoons of these stars are still sufficiently opaque at near ir wavelengths to absorb radiation from the central objects , and most of them are known to radiate in the thermal ir .",
    "these may be the least evolved type of uch  ii region .",
    "two uch  ii point sources in the central cluster have @xmath2band counterparts ; unpublished @xmath2band spectra show no stellar absorption lines but br@xmath4 circumstellar ( ? ) emission features are seen .",
    "this spectrum is consistent with an origin in a hot , dense disc .",
    "stars with similar characteristics have previously been found to be exciting uch  ii regions in other galactic gh  ii regions .",
    "the birth cocoons of these objects have thinned sufficiently that the putative disc emission from the central object is visible .",
    "we suggest that an accretion disc must be present _ throughout _ the entire uch  ii region phase of massive star birth if the revealed object has a remnant disc .",
    "there is evidence of nebular br@xmath4 emission and candidate exciting stars around the periphery of the cluster .",
    "the outer parts of w49a might well resemble a normal h  ii region if viewed without the intervening interstellar dust : recall the low density radio source descriptions of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "it appears that star birth may have begun on the edges of w49a and shifted more recently to the denser interstellar medium in the center .",
    "alternatively , the lifetime of the uch  ii / cocoon phases may lengthen in the denser environment of the central cluster .    it has long been suggested that massive stars form nearly entirely in clusters and associations . in w49a , we see an example of the earliest parts of the birth processes , with the individual stars in various stages of emergence from their cocoons . in w49a",
    "the newly born massive stars form within their own cocoons and retain their individuality . as with field",
    "uch  ii regions , small mass stars may be present close by .",
    "w49a represents a galactic gh  ii region still going through its initial birth pangs .",
    "it is similar in luminosity ( @xmath35 o star equivalents ) to the brightest udh  ii regions recently discovered in m33 , ngc253 and ncg6946 @xcite .",

    "<S> w49a is one of the most luminous giant h  ii ( gh  ii ) regions in our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this star forming complex contains numerous compact and ultra - compact ( uc ) h  ii regions , extending over an area of @xmath0 15 pc . </S>",
    "<S> it emits about @xmath1 lyman continuum photons per second , equivalent to the presence of about 100 o stars , but it is completely obscured in optical wavelengths by intervening interstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> the center holds a `` cluster '' of about 30 o stars , each within an individual uchii region emitting free  free emission at cm wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> our deep @xmath2band ( @xmath3 m ) image toward the w49a cluster reveals just two of the individual exciting stars , each associated with a point  like radio source , but the rest are invisible . </S>",
    "<S> these o stars are so recently born as to not yet have emerged from their natal dust cocoons , in contrast to other galactic clusters embedded in gh  ii regions in which many of the individual massive stars are already revealed . </S>",
    "<S> plausibility arguments are made which suggest that a stellar disc might be common during the entire uch  ii phase of massive star birth , as it persists after accretion ceases in some stars . </S>",
    "<S> nebular emission ( e.g. , from br@xmath4 ) is visible around the periphery of the central region of w49a , along with candidate exciting stars . </S>",
    "<S> star formation there may have preceeded that in the center , or its lower density environment may have speeded up the dispersal of the natal dust cocoons . </S>",
    "<S> the w49a cluster can serve as a template for the more luminous buried star clusters now being found in normal galaxies and starbursts . </S>"
