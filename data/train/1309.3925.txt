    "massive stars , in particular those in interacting binary systems , hold many secretes in their evolution . some of these puzzles are related to the synthesis of different isotopes . our study is related to the peculiar abundances of some isotopes in the red supergiant ( rsg ) star hv2112 in the small magellanic cloud , and to the site of the strong r - process .",
    "the paper is centered around jets that are assumed to be launched by the neutron star ( ns ) as it accretes material from the common envelope ( ce ) with a rsg star .",
    "contrary to recent claims that hv2112 is a thorne - ytkow object ( tzo ; @xcite ) , we show that a tzo is unlikely to be formed through the evolution of a ns inside the envelope of a rsg star .",
    "the reason is that the jets launched by the ns expel the entire envelope and most of the core .",
    "another major problem in astrophysics is the exact sites where the r - process nucleosynthesis takes place . for the site(s ) of the `` strong r - process '' , where elements of atomic weight @xmath0 are formed , there have been two main contenders in recent years ( e.g. , @xcite ) : the merge of two neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , and jets from a rapidly rotating newly born single ns @xcite .",
    "previous studies of r - process nucleosynthesis in jets include @xcite who suggested the possibility of creating r - process elements inside the jets launched at a velocity of @xmath1 from an accretion disk around a rapidly rotating proto - ns .",
    "@xcite simulated the r - process nucleosynthesis during a jet - powered explosion . in their simulation",
    "a rotating star with a magnetic field induced a jet - like outflow during the collapse which explodes the star .",
    "neutrinos played no role in their simulation .",
    "@xcite calculated the nucleosynthesis inside the hot bubble formed in the jittering - jets model for core - collapse supernova explosions ( ccsn ) , and found that substantial amount of r - process material can be formed .",
    "@xcite assumed that in the jittering - jets explosion model the jets are launched close to the ns where the gas is neutron - rich ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some r - process elements are believed to be found in all low - metallicity stars , and thus r - process nucleosynthesis must take place continuously from very early times in the galactic evolution @xcite .",
    "since the jittering - jets model was constructed to account for the explosion of _ all _ ccsne , the r - process induced by the jittering jets can account for the continuous formation of r - process elements .",
    "however , the abundance of heavy r - process elements has much larger variations among different stars , implying that part of the heavy r - process , termed strong r - process , is formed in rare events ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we propose a new speculative site for strong r - process nucleosynthesis in which it is formed by jets launched by a ns spiraling - in inside the core of a giant star .",
    "these jets will also explode the star .",
    "this is a rare evolutionary route and hence complies with the finding of large variations in the abundances of these elements . in this first study",
    "we limit ourselves to present the scenario and show its viability .",
    "most ingredients of our newly proposed scenario were studied in the past but were never put together into a coherent picture to yield a new possible site for the strong r - process .",
    "previously studied ingredients of our proposed scenario include the ce of a ns and a giant ( @xcite ) , the launching of neutron - rich gas from accretion disks around compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the launching of jets by ns accreting at a high rate @xcite , and the formation of r - process elements in jets from ns @xcite .",
    "the idea that jets can explode stars under specific conditions was also studied in the past , e.g. , in a ce evolution @xcite .",
    "another specific class of models are based on magnetic amplification by a rapidly rotating stellar core ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this magnetorotational mechanism creates bipolar outflows ( jets ) around the newly born ns that are able to explode the star .",
    "however , the required core s rotation rate is much larger than what stellar evolution models give , hence making most of these models applicable for only special cases .",
    "we , on the other hand , claim that _ all _ ccsne are exploded by jets , the jittering - jets model , that also synthesize r - process elements ( but not the strong r - process ) , and hence our newly proposed scenario is part of a unified picture we try to construct for exploding _ all _ massive stars and the synthesis of r - process elements . in the jittering - jets model",
    "the explosion of ccsne is powered by jittering jets launched by an intermittent accretion disk around the newly born ns @xcite .",
    "the intermittent accretion disk is formed by gas accreted from the convective core regions that have a stochastic angular momentum @xcite .",
    "@xcite already studied the spiraling - in of a ns inside a red supergiant envelope and considered two outcomes , that of envelope ejection , and that of core - ns merger .",
    "however , they did not consider jets .",
    "the removal of the envelope during a ce evolution by jets launched by a ns or a wd companion was discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility that the mass loss prior to an explosion of a core - ns merger process is driven by a ce evolution of a ns ( or a bh ) in the envelope of a massive star .",
    "as already discussed by @xcite , jets launched by an accretion disk around the ns companion deposit energy to the envelope and help in removing the envelope .",
    "wds can do the same @xcite .",
    "however , for a ns the accretion process to form an accretion disk is much more efficient due to neutrino cooling @xcite .",
    "this allows the ns to accrete at a very high rate , much above the classical eddington limit , hence leading to an explosive deposition of energy to the envelope @xcite .",
    "the process by which jets launched by an inspiraling ns expel the envelope @xcite and then the core in an explosive manner @xcite implies that no thorne - ytkow objects ( @xcite ; a red giant with a ns in its core ) can be formed via a ce evolutionary route .",
    "we strengthen this conclusion in section [ sec : commonenvelope ] .",
    "in section [ sec : commonenvelope ] we study the ce evolution toward the explosion and estimate the typical accretion rate and time scale .",
    "a new ingredient in our ce calculation is the assumption that mainly jets launched by the inspiraling ns drive the envelope ejection via the jet - feedback mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the ns is able to expel the entire envelope by the jets @xcite , and as a consequence can not enter inside the core .",
    "however , it seems that a merger at the end of the ce phase can be quite common @xcite , and we study such cases . in section",
    "[ sec : implciaitons ] we list two , somewhat speculative , processes that are motivated by our results .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) mass accretion rate @xcite inside the envelope is ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a general overview of ce see @xcite ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ns mass , @xmath4 its velocity relative to the giant s envelope , @xmath5 is the sound speed inside the envelope , and @xmath6 is the envelope density at the ns location . the ns moves mildly supersonically and we can use the approximation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ns s keplerian velocity .",
    "we use the red giant s profile from @xcite with a mass of @xmath9 , a radius of @xmath10 , a core radius of @xmath11 , and a core mass of @xmath12",
    ". a power law fit of the density profile in the giant s envelope gives @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radial coordinate of the star .",
    "the bhl accretion rate can then be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance between the ns and the core s center , @xmath17 is the giant s mass enclosed inside radius @xmath14 , @xmath18 , and we take @xmath19 in the rest of the paper .",
    "we take the mass accretion rate to be a fraction @xmath20 of the bhl accretion rate , and we take a fraction @xmath21 of the accreted mass to be launched in the two jets @xmath22    around the ns an accretion disk is easily formed as the ratio of orbital separation to the ns radius is very large , such that the specific angular momentum of the accreted gas is more than an order of magnitude above what is required to form an accretion disk ( eq .",
    "7 of @xcite ) .",
    "such an accretion disc can launch two bipolar jets inside the envelope as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral - in ] . as a result of the ns motion the jets will encounter different parts of the envelope during their propagation and form a hot bubble on each side of the orbital plane @xcite .        to examine the fate of the jets we compare the propagation time scale of the jets inside the envelope @xmath23 with the time scale it takes for a jet s head to cross its width @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath23 can be estimate as follows . the jets head velocity @xmath25 is determined by the pressure balance on the two sides of the jets head @xmath26 , as @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the initial velocity of the gas in the jet , about the escape speed from the neutron star , and @xmath29 is the envelope density encountered by the jet .",
    "we take the jet to have a half opening angle of @xmath30 ( the exact value of @xmath31 is not important , it can be any value less than about 0.5 ) , and a mass outflow rate into each jet of @xmath32 .",
    "the jets head velocity is then @xmath33 where we take the jets density to be @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "the propagation time of the jets to a distance @xmath36 can then be solved analytically @xmath37.\\ ] ]    we substitute @xmath38 from equation [ eq : macc0 ] , take @xmath39 , define @xmath40 , and scale quantities for the inner part of the envelope to get @xmath41 \\s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the crossing time we take @xcite @xmath42 the ratio between these times is given by ( note that @xmath31 cancels out ) @xmath43   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the jets are unlikely to penetrate through the envelope when @xmath44 .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the moment a fresh supply of jet material ceases along a particular direction , the propagation of the jet s head stops along that direction .",
    "the inequality @xmath45 implies that before the jet s head manages to exit the star along any direction , a fresh supply of jet material has ceased ; the jet cone has crossed that direction and moved to other directions .",
    "this process was simulated in a very simple preliminary setting @xcite , but it requires detail numerical simulations to determine the exact outcome , and under what conditions the jets dissipate in the envelope . from simulations of active galactic nuclei jets we know that a relative motion of the jets source and the inter - stellar medium leads to dissipation and bubble inflation @xcite .",
    "for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the ratio is @xmath49 we find that the condition @xmath45 is satisfied . we conclude that the jets may not be able to penetrate through the envelope and will deposit their energy inside the envelope .    the total energy deposited by the jets inside the envelope is @xmath50 where integration is over the lifetime of the jets .",
    "@xmath38 can be eliminated with an expression that equates the power of the interaction of the ns with the envelope , i.e. , the work of the drag force , with the releasing rate of orbital energy @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter characterizing the drag force ( accretion + gravitational interaction with the rest of the envelope ) . equations ( [ ejej ] ) and ( [ l ] ) give @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the giant radius , and @xmath16 is the final location of the ns . approximating the reduced mass by @xmath55 allows us to perform the integration analytically to obtain @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{eq : ej}\\ ] ] as the jets are unlikely to penetrate the envelope , we assume that there is a self regulation process , i.e. , a negative feedback process @xcite , such that the jets from the ns prevent the accretion rate on to the ns from being too high .",
    "few words on the nature of the jet launching setting are in place here .",
    "first , we note that some recent numerical simulations of ce evolution have showed that there is an initial rapid phase of evolution in which the orbit is shrunk significantly while the outer parts of the ce are inflated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even in that phase",
    "the accretion rate by the companion can be quite high , despite being below the bhl rate . in the simulation of @xcite the rapid plunge - in phase lasts for about 20 days , and",
    "the accreted mass during that period is @xmath57 , giving an accretion rate of @xmath58 .",
    "this is more than what is required for neutrino cooling to allow high accretion rate @xcite .",
    "so the ns can accrete at a very high rate along the entire ce evolution of the cases studied here .",
    "another point to emphasize is that the accretion energy can in principle be channelled to neutrinos , jets , and electromagnetic ( em ) radiation .",
    "we take the view that at very high accretion rates , both on to ns and main sequence stars , a large fraction of the energy is carried by jets rather than by em radiation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the neutrino cooling in the present setting allows a very high accretion rate , but we assume that the jets power is much above the eddington luminosity limit .",
    "the jets are collimated , such that accretion can proceed from directions perpendicular to the jets axis . in this process",
    "most of the energy in the disk that is not carried by neutrinos is transferred to magnetic fields that by violent reconnection eject mass .",
    "namely , energy is channelled to magnetic fields and outflows much more than to thermal energy and em radiation ( shiber , s. , schreier , r. , & soker , n. , 2015 , in preparation ) . the jets are not only a byproduct of the high accretion rate allowed by neutrino cooling , but by themselves allow an even higher accretion rate .",
    "thirdly , we point out that part of the evolution might take place in a grazing envelope evolution ( gee ) rather than a ce evolution . in the gee a stellar companion ( ns or a main sequence star ) grazes the envelope of a giant star while both the orbital separation and the giant radius shrink simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the orbital decay itself is caused by the gravitational interaction of the secondary star with the envelope inward to its orbit , i.e. , dynamical friction ( gravitational tide ) .",
    "the binary system might be viewed as evolving in a constant state of ` just entering a ce phase ' .",
    "the gee is made possible only if the companion manages to accreted mass at a high rate and launch jets that remove the outskirts of the giant envelope , hence preventing the formation of a ce .",
    "this might occur when the ns is in the low density parts of the envelope .",
    "eventually it enters the dense part of the core ( see below ) , and a ce phase commences . hence , the occurrence of a gee in the outer parts of the envelope does not change our conclusions .      let the removal of the envelope by the jets have an efficiency of @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 the removal energy supplied by the jets is smaller than the binding energy of the envelope since in addition to the energy deposited by the jets there is the orbital energy of the spiraling - in binary system . in the traditional ce calculation only the orbital energy is considered .",
    "the binding energy of the envelope of the model described in section [ sec : derivation ] is @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{eq : e_bind}\\ ] ] for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 .",
    "substituting equations ( [ eq : ej ] ) and ( [ eq : e_bind ] ) in equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) gives @xmath66 substituting typical values in equation ( [ eq : m_bh ] ) with @xmath67 we find the accretion rate of the ns for @xmath68 to be @xmath69 . in this regime neutrino - cooled accretion occurs as @xmath70 @xcite , and so high accretion rate can take place .",
    "the keplerian orbital time is @xmath71 hours .",
    "if evolution proceed over a time of @xmath72  day , the total accreted mass is less than about @xmath73 .",
    "the total accreted mass in the jet - feedback scenario is calculated from @xmath74 this gives an upper limit on the accreted mass as the orbital gravitational energy released by the ns - core system reduces the required energy from the jets .",
    "substituting typical values used here we derive @xmath75 this is the same as the value estimated above , showing that the final stage of the ce inside the envelope lasts for about @xmath76day .",
    "hence , most of the accretion takes place during the few hours to few days of the final stage of the ce , when evolution is rapid . in the outer regions of the envelope , that have very small binding energy and where the spiraling - in time is of order of years",
    ", the accretion rate is very small in the feedback scenario .",
    "we emphasize again that although most of the accretion energy is taken by neutrinos , in the proposed scenario a non - negligible fraction of the energy is carried by jets launched from the accretion disk around the ns .",
    "when accretion rate is high , we have @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the neutrino luminosity , @xmath79 is the jets power , and @xmath80 is the critical eddington luminosity from the ns .    we conclude that within the frame of the jet - feedback mechanism a ns ends the spiraling - in inside the envelope of a giant after accreting only a small amount of mass , that most likely leaves it as a ns rather than forming a bh .",
    "we can repeat the calculations of section [ sec : envelope ] to the phase when the ns is inside the core .",
    "the binding energy of the core is larger than @xmath81 .",
    "the ejected mass by the jets in the frame of the jet - feedback mechanism is @xmath82 the keplerian orbital period for the core and the ns is approximately @xmath83 minutes . during that time",
    "the ns can explode the core with the jets .",
    "the explosion will last a few minutes , but since the entire system is optically thick due to the ejected envelope , the explosion will last days , as in a typical sn . by explosion",
    "we refer here to the case where the jets expel the envelope or the core within a time period much shorter than the dynamical time of the giant , and the ejected mass has energy above its binding energy .",
    "this occurs when the ns is deep in the envelope or inside the core .    during the ns merger with the core",
    "the bondi - hoyle accertion rate can get as high as @xmath84 @xcite . in this regime neutrino - cooled accretion can take place as @xmath85 @xcite , and the accretion rate can get near the bondi - hoyle rate .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that the actual rate can be much lower than the bondi - hoyle rate .",
    "in addition , @xcite argued that angular momentum considerations can prevent neutrino cooling from occurring .",
    "here we take a different approach , we assume that jets are lunched during the ns - core merger process .",
    "these jets move relative to the core material as the ns spirals - in and deposit part of their energy inside the core .",
    "this limits the accretion rate by a feedback mechanism ; higher accretion rate results in higher energy deposition in the core and so suppresses the accretion process .",
    "the ns spirals inside the core within about @xmath86 orbits , summing up to a total interaction time of @xmath87hour .",
    "the interaction of the jets with the core takes place within a radius of @xmath88 .",
    "this accretion rate is well below the bondi - hoyle rate and is comparable with the results of @xcite .",
    "the result of the process will be probably observed as a type iin sn @xcite .    finally , when the ns is well inside the core , such that the core mass that is left is about equal to the ns mass , the rest of the core forms an accretion disk around the ns .",
    "this accretion disk of mass @xmath89 launches jets that interact with gas at a larger distances of @xmath90 .",
    "this distance comes from the distance the mass expelled from the core at the escape speed of @xmath91 reaches within a fraction of an hour .",
    "gamma ray burst ( grbs ) are observed in type ic sn @xcite and hence we do nt claim this system will be a grb , since likely the jets do not penetrate the entire envelope .",
    "if our claim that jets from ns can indeed remove the envelope and part of the core of rsg stars holds , we can think of two implications . both of which require further study .",
    "@xcite attributed the peculiar abundances of some isotopes of the red supergiant ( rsg ) star hv2112 in the small magellanic cloud to the star being a thorne - ytkow object ( tzo ) .",
    "however , some features , such as the high calcium abundance , are not accounted for by processes occurring in tzo .",
    "@xcite examined whether hv2112 can be a super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) star , a star with an oxygen / neon core supported by electron degeneracy and undergoing thermal pulses with a third dredge up .",
    "the initial mass range of sagb progenitors is thought to be @xmath92 @xcite , depending on the manner convective overshooting is treated @xcite and on metallicity @xcite .",
    "rsg stars originate from more massive stars than the progenitors of sagb stars . at the evolutionary stage of hv2112 , sagb and",
    "rsg stars occupy more or less the same region in the hr diagram . in the tzo scenario",
    "the star hv2112 is a rsg star , while in the scenario proposed here it is a sagb star , hence of a lower mass .",
    "@xcite argued that a sagb star can synthesize most of the elements that were used to claim hv2112 to be a tzo , e.g. , molybdenum , rubidium , and lithium .",
    "but they found no way for a sagb star to synthesize calcium .",
    "they still preferred a tzo interpretation for hv2112 , and attributed the enriched calcium envelope to the formation process of a tzo .",
    "the calcium , they argued , can be synthesized when the degenerate electron core of a giant star is tidally disrupted by a neutron star and forms a disk around the ns , as in the calculations of @xcite for a wd merger with a ns .",
    "the high temperatures in such accretion disk leads to calcium production .",
    "interestingly , they found that the kinetic energy of the outflow from the accretion disk that is required to spread calcium in the giant , has enough energy to unbind the envelope .",
    "they postulated that the outflow is collimated , hence most of it escapes from the star .",
    "we find in section [ sec : commonenvelope ] that the jets from the ns are formed while it is still in a keplerian orbit , hence the jets are not well collimated , and the envelope and a large part of the core are ejected .",
    "the peculiar abundances of some isotopes ( e.g. lithium ) might be related to the presence of a binary companion .",
    "the post agb star hd172481 , with a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath93 , is in a binary system and has a very high lithium abundance @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted that a sagb star can synthesize all elements , besides calcium .",
    "they argued against the calcium enrichment scenario by a ccsn because the fraction of intercepted ejecta by hv2112 , while still on the main sequence , is small .    based on our calculations in section [ sec : commonenvelope ]",
    "we argue that a tzo can not be formed in the process where a ns spirals inside a rsg star .",
    "the jets launched by the accreting ns will expel the entire envelope .",
    "we instead speculate that hv2112 had a companion just slightly more massive than hv2112 when both were on the main sequence . in such massive binary systems",
    "the lighter star expands to become a giant before the more massive star explodes @xcite . by the influence of the companion",
    "the ccsn could have been a type ib sn . at explosion",
    ", the radius of hv2112 , @xmath94 , could have been a sizable fraction of the orbital separation , @xmath16 .",
    "it intercepted a fraction of @xmath95 of the sn ejecta .",
    "we use this ratio to replace equation ( 4 ) of @xcite where the factor is scaled to @xmath96 .",
    "if , for example , the companion s initial mass was about @xmath97 , it could have ejected @xmath98 of calcium @xcite .",
    "as the mass of calcium in hv2112 is estimated by @xcite to be @xmath99 , it requires about a quarter of the sn ejecta to hit hv2112 during the explosion and stays bound to it , for such an orbital separation ( for more detail see @xcite ) . after the explosion the ns was kicked out of the binary system .",
    "the main question for the proposed scenario is whether indeed such a large amount of calcium can be accreted to the companion . while some other works suggested this possibility for other systems , e.g. , for the hyper ",
    "runaway star hd271791 @xcite , recent numerical simulations by @xcite suggested that this is not possible .",
    "the sn ejecta that encounter the companion induce a shock that runs through the companion .",
    "the shock heats the companion and the excess energy leads to mass removal . in their numerical simulations they found that up to @xmath100 of the companion mass can be removed ; this is the case when the companion is as close as possible , as the scaling we used above of @xmath101 .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then our proposed scenario can not work .",
    "however , there are some processes that might change the outcome , in particular non - spherical sn ejecta of calcium ( and other newly synthesized elements ) . a non spherical ejection of synthesized elements",
    "is expected in the jittering - jets model for core collapse sn explosion @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the amount of calcium produced in the sn explosion is larger , or at least the calcium distribution is non - spherical , with calcium - rich gas ejected toward the companion .",
    "another process that can overcome the difficulties posed by the results of @xcite and allows large quantities of calcium and other heavy elements to be accreted on to the companion is if the newly synthesized elements from the core of the sn expand in dense clumps .",
    "such clumps can penetrate deeper to the star , and stay bound .",
    "we consider the question of whether sn ejecta can enriched a companion as not settled yet , but it is the weak point of the speculative scenario proposed here .      our analysis in section [ sec : commonenvelope ] points to three types of interactions of the ns jets inside a common envelope , ce - sn jets , with a star that could in principle take place .",
    "( @xmath102 ) small amounts of jets mass interact with the low density envelope during the final stages of the inspiral inside the envelope .",
    "( @xmath103 ) next a jets mass of about @xmath104 interacts with the dense core when the ns enters the core .",
    "interaction occurs within a distance of about @xmath105 . the amount of mass carried by the jets and their typical distance of interaction with stellar mater in the above two types of jets , is determined by the assumptions of the jet - feedback mechanism",
    "one has to bear in mind the large uncertainties .",
    "( @xmath106 ) finally , the central leftover of the core is destructed by the ns gravity and an accretion disk of about @xmath107 is formed around the ns .",
    "this disk is expected to launch jets with a total mass of about @xmath108 , that catch - up with previously ejected core material at @xmath109 .",
    "the last two stages occur within a few minutes , and the last launching episode , the most massive one , lasts for tens to hundreds of seconds .    the r - process can generally occur both in the jets @xcite and in the post shock jets material @xcite . in the type @xmath110 jet interaction listed above the amount of jet material is small and its contribution to the r - process can be neglected .",
    "for the latter phases the post shock temperature can be estimated from the post shock radiation dominated pressure , @xmath111 @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the solid opening angle of the jet and @xmath14 is the radius where the jet is shocked .",
    "this is much too low for r - process to occur in the post shock jets material at a distance of @xmath114 . in these cases",
    "r - process will occur inside the jets .",
    "the flow structure studied here is different in key ingredients from two other types of jet launching models in ccsne . in the jittering jets model",
    "@xcite , listed in the second column of table [ table : jets ] , jets are launched by a newly formed ns . however",
    ", each launching episode lasts for a short time of less than @xmath115 , and the disk formed at each launching episode is short lived .",
    "it is not clear that the neutron fraction in the ejecta will be as high as in the case studied here , where the magnetic fields lift material from very close to the ns @xcite .",
    "another difference is that the high neutrino luminosity from the newly formed ns in the jittering jets model is likely to bring the ejecta closer to equilibrium , e.g. , lower the neutron fraction .",
    "a third difference is that the jittering jets are expected to explode the star , and so they are shocked relatively close to the center at @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "even if strong - r process elements have been synthesize in the jets , they will be disintegrated in the shock . in the flow studied in the present paper the shock",
    "is expected to take place much further out , and the core of the primary star has been already destroyed and formed the massive accretion disk now circling the ns .",
    "our flow structure is markedly different from the jets launched in grb that are formed around black holes ( bh ) . in the flow studied by @xcite , for example",

    "this has a large effect on the formation of r - process elements in neutrino driven winds and could affect to some degree the r - process in ccnse jets @xcite .",
    "in particular , high neutrino luminosity can suppresses the third peak of the r - process .",
    "the synthesis of the third peak , the strong r - process , is a rare process relative to the synthesis process of the first two peaks , as evident from the large abundance variations of eu / fe found in old stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that in magnetic - jet simulation strong r - process with mass of about @xmath143 is synthesized . to account for the third peak abundance they required that one in about @xmath144 ccsne has the strong r - process .",

    "this ratio is based on the simulations of jets in ccsne performed by @xcite who found that the total amount of r - process elements is approximately @xmath150 of the total jets ejected mass .",
    "this mass is similar to what @xcite have found .",
    "we studied the common - envelope ( ce ) evolution of a ns inside a red supergiant ( rsg ; section [ sec : commonenvelope ] ) , and found that the ns is very likely to launch energetic jets that might expel the entire envelope and most of the core of the giant star .",
    "based on this , we proposed that thorne ",
    "ytkow objects are unlikely to be formed by this channel if accretion on to the neutron star can exceed the eddington rate with much of the accretion energy directed into jets that subsequently dissipate within the giant envelope .",
    "we then discussed the implications of our results to the recent claim that the evolved star hv2112 is a tzo @xcite , and to r - process nucleosynthesis inside the jets .     in the tzo model for hv2112 @xcite",
    "the star is a rsg star originated from a main sequence star with an initial mass of @xmath151 . in section [ subsec : hv2112 ]",
    "we proposed an alternative scenario for the peculiar abundances of hv2112 . in the proposed rare scenario hv2112",
    "is presently a super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) star that originated from a main sequence star with an initial mass of @xmath152 . beside calcium",
    ", sagb can synthesize all elements with high abundances @xcite .",
    "we suggest that hv2112 had a companion slightly more massive than the initial mass of hv2112 .",
    "the companion evolved first , but it exploded when hv2112 was already a giant @xcite .",
    "this implies that hv2112 intercepted a large fraction of the supernova ejecta , including a sufficient mass of calcium .",
    "we also point out some weak points in our proposed scenario .",
    "in particular the question of whether a giant companion can accrete a large enough fraction from the sn ejecta that hits it .",
    "it seems that our proposed scenario might work only if the newly synthesized elements are ejected from the core of the sn in non - spherical structures , i.e. , clumps or jets toward the companion .    in section [ subsec : rprocess ]",
    "we discussed the possibility that jets launched by the ns as it merges with the giant s core could be a rare site for the strong r - process .",
    "although most ingredients of the proposed scenario were studied in the past , they were never put together to yield the scenario we have proposed in this study .",
    "for example , the ns - core merger was studied in the past as a possible candidate for supernovae events where strong interaction with a dens environment takes place @xcite .",
    "as the ns accretes mass from the giant at a very high rate due to neutrino cooling , an accretion disk is formed around the ns and two opposite jets are launched during the spiral - in process @xcite .",
    "we estimated the total energy deposited by the jets inside the envelope ( eq . [ eq : ej ] ) using the jet - feedback mechanism @xcite , where energy deposit by the jets regulates the accretion rate .",
    "a small amount of accreted mass is sufficient to launch jets that expel the envelope ( section [ sec : envelope ] ) .    in many cases",
    "the ns merges with the core .",
    "we termed the jets launched by the ns during its interaction with the core ` ce - ns jets ' . in these cases",
    "we have found that much stronger jets are launched ( section [ sec : core ] ) , unbind , and expel the outer parts of the core .",
    "the total mass launched by the jets in the outer part of the core is about @xmath153 .",
    "the jets in this phase interact with the surrounding core matter at a distance of @xmath154 .",
    "this distance is too large for the r - process to occur inside the post shock jets material due to low post - shock temperature ( eqaution [ eq : temp ] ) .",
    "however , the r - process can take place inside the jets close to the center before they are shocked , much as in the mhd jets studied by @xcite .    in the third and final phase when the ns is well inside the core",
    "an accretion disk with a mass of about @xmath107 is form around the ns from the destructed core .",
    "this accretion disk launches two opposite jets with a total mass of approximately @xmath155 .",
    "we find that in total @xmath148 of jets material is ejected by the ns as it interacts with the core ( see table [ table : jets ] ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis of r - process elements can take place inside these jets @xcite with a total r - process material that can be as high as about @xmath104 .",
    "we compared the properties of the ce - sn jets with jets launched in ccsne and found that the flow studied here is similar to that of mhd jets launched by newly formed ns when the pre - collapse core is rapidly rotating @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that under these conditions of low - entropy neutron - rich outflow the third r - process peak elements can be synthesized ( the strong r - process ) .",
    "lower neutrino luminosity of the ns in the ns - core merger ( table [ table : jets ] ) favors the production of strong r - process in the ce - ns jets compared to ccsne jets .",
    "the rareness of this process of approximately @xmath156 of the ccsne rate @xcite can explain the large scattering of r - process elements in the early chemical evolution of the galaxy ( @xcite ) ."
