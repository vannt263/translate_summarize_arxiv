    "in the near future , experiments at two , high  energy hadron colliders will search for evidence of physics that supersedes the standard model .",
    "important among the tools that will be used in these searches are showering event generators or showering monte carlos ( smc s ) . among the most versatile and popular of these are the monte carlos herwig @xcite , isajet @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "smc s are useful because they accurately describe the emission of multiple soft gluons , which is , in effect , an all orders problem in qcd .",
    "however , they only predict total cross sections to a leading order accuracy , and , thus , can demonstrate a sizeable dependence on the choice of scale used for the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) or coupling constants ( particularly @xmath3 ) .",
    "also , in general , they do not translate smoothly into kinematic configurations where only one , hard parton is emitted . in distinction to smc s are certain analytic calculations which account for multiple soft gluon emission and higher order corrections to the hard scattering .",
    "these resummation calculations , however , integrate out the kinematics of the soft gluons , and , thus , are limited in their predictive power .",
    "they can , for example , describe the kinematics of a heavy gauge boson produced in hadron collision , but can not predict the number or distribution of jets that accompany it .",
    "however , searches for new physics , either directly or indirectly through careful measurements of standard model predictions , often demand detailed knowledge of kinematic distributions and jet activity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0+jets ( and @xmath1+jets ) processes are often backgrounds to susy or technicolor signatures , and we demand a reliable prediction of their properties .",
    "the aim of this present study is to show how the positive features of the analytic resummation calculations can be used to improve the showering algorithms .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we review the parton shower ( sec .",
    "ii ) and the analytic resummation formalisms ( sec .",
    "we then show how to modify the showing algorithm to incorporate higher  order corrections to the total cross section ( sec .",
    "furthermore , we show how to correct the soft gluon approximation made in the showering , so that there is a smooth transition between the showering and hard emission limits ( sec .",
    "v ) , and we compare this approach to other work . finally , we present numerical results ( sec .",
    "vi ) for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and higgs boson production at the tevatron in run ii using a modified version of , and our conclusions ( sec .",
    "vii ) .    in the ensuing discussion ,",
    "we focus on the specific example of @xmath0 boson production at a hadron collider , when the @xmath0 decays leptonically .",
    "the results apply equally well to @xmath4 and higgs bosons ( or any heavy , color  singlet particle ) produced in hadron collisions .",
    "smc s are based on the factorization theorem @xcite , which , roughly , states that physical observables in any sensible gauge theory are the product of short  distance functions and long  distance functions .",
    "the short  distance functions are calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the long  distance functions are fit at a scale , but their evolution to any other scale is also calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "a standard application of the factorization theorem is to describe @xmath0 boson production at a @xmath5 collider at a fixed order in @xmath3 .",
    "the production cross section is obtained by convoluting the partonic subprocesses evaluated at the scale @xmath6 with the pdf s evaluated at @xmath6 .",
    "the partons involved in the hard collision must be sufficiently virtual to be resolved inside the proton , and a natural choice for the scale @xmath6 is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "prior to the hard collision , however , the partons are not resolvable in the proton ( i.e. the proton is intact ) and have virtualities at a much lower scale @xmath8 of the order of 1 gev .",
    "the connection between the partons at the low scale @xmath8 and those at the high scale @xmath6 is described by the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the dglap equations include the most important kinematic configurations of the splittings @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent different types of partons in the hadron ( @xmath12 , etc . ) .",
    "starting from a measurement of the pdf s at a low scale @xmath8 , a solution of the dglap equations yields the pdf s at the hard scale @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , starting with a parton @xmath11 involved in a hard collision , it is also possible to determine probabilistically which splittings generated @xmath11 . in the process of de  evolving parton @xmath11 back to the valence quarks in the proton , a number of spectator partons ( e.g. parton @xmath13 in the branching @xmath14 ) are resolved .",
    "these partons constitute a shower of soft jets that accompany the @xmath0boson , and influence its kinematics .",
    "the shower described above occurs with unit probability and does not change the total cross section for @xmath0boson production calculated at the scale @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the showering can be attached to the hard  scattering process based on a probability distribution _",
    "after _ the hard scattering has been selected .",
    "once kinematic cuts are applied , the transverse momentum and rapidity of the @xmath0boson populate regions never accessed by the differential partonic cross section calculated at a fixed order .",
    "this is consistent , since the fixed ",
    "order calculation was inclusive ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) and was never intended to describe the detailed kinematics of the @xmath0boson .",
    "the parton shower , in effect , resolves the structure of the inclusive state of partons denoted as @xmath16 . in practice , the fixed order partonic cross section ( without showering )",
    "can still be used to describe properties of the decay leptons as long as the measurable is well defined ( e.g. , the number of leptons with central rapidity and high transverse momentum , but not the distribution of rapidity or transverse momentum of the @xmath0 ) .    here , we review parton showering schematically .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . first , for simplicity",
    ", consider the case of final state or forward showering , where the parton virtuality @xmath6 evolves forward to the low scale @xmath8 .",
    "the basis for developing a probabilistic picture of final state showering is the dglap equation for the fragmentation functions : q q d_a(x , q ) = _ x^1-dz z_abc(z , q ) _",
    "abc(z ) d_b(x / z , q ) + -d_a(x , q ) _",
    "x^1-dz_abc(z , q ) _",
    "abc(z ) , where @xmath17 is an unregularized splitting function , @xmath18 is the coupling times color factor , and @xmath19 is a cutoff . the equation can be rewritten as ( d_a(x , q)/(q ) ) = _ x^1dz z_abc(z , q ) 2 _ abc(z ) ( d_b(x / z , q)/(q ) ) or , after integrating both sides of the expression , d_a(x , t ) = d_a(x , t ) ( t ) + _ t^t_x^1 dt  dzz ( t ) ( t  ) _",
    "abc(z , t  ) 2 _ abc(z ) d_b(x / z , t  ) , where @xmath20 with similar definitions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the function ( t ) = ( -_t_0^t_^1- dt  dz _ abc(z , t  ) 2 _ abc(z ) ) gives the probability of evolving from the scale @xmath23 to @xmath24 with no resolvable branchings , and is called the sudakov form factor .",
    "@xmath25 is a cutoff scale for the showering .",
    "@xmath26 contains all the information necessary to reconstruct a shower , since it encodes the change in virtuality of a parton until a resolvable showering occurs .",
    "showering is reduced to iterative solutions of the equation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a random number uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath29 $ ] , until a solution for @xmath30 is found which is below a cutoff . for consistency ,",
    "the cutoff should represent the lowest scale of resolvable emission @xmath8 .    for the case of initial state radiation ,",
    "several modifications are necessary .",
    "the fragmentation function is replaced by a parton distribution function , and the evolution proceeds backwards from a large , negative scale @xmath31 to a small , negative cutoff scale @xmath32 .",
    "there are two equivalent formulations of backwards showering based on the probabilities ( -_t^t_^1- dt  dz _",
    "abc(z , t  ) 2 _ abc(z ) x f_a(x,t)x f_b(x , t ) ) , x=x / z @xcite , and @xcite .    after choosing the change in virtuality ,",
    "a particular backwards branching is selected from the probability function based on their relative weights ( a summation over all possible branchings @xmath14 is implied these expressions ) , and the splitting variable is chosen by solving the equation _ ^x / x dzz _ abc(z)f(x / z , t ) = r _ ^1- dzz _",
    "abc(z)f(x / z , t ) , where @xmath28 is a random number .",
    "the details of how a full shower is reconstructed in the  monte carlo , for example , can be found in ref .",
    "the structure of the shower can be complex : the transverse momentum of the @xmath0boson is built up from the whole series of splittings and boosts , and is known only at the end of the shower , after the final boost .",
    "the smc formulation outlined above is fairly independent of the hard scattering process considered .",
    "only the initial choice of partons and possibly the high scale differs .",
    "therefore , this formalism can be applied universally to many different scattering problems . in effect , soft gluons are not sensitive to the specifics of the hard scattering , only the color charge of the incoming partons .",
    "at hadron colliders , the partonic cross sections can receive substantial corrections at higher orders in @xmath3 .",
    "this affects not only the total production rate , but also the kinematics of the @xmath0 boson . at leading order ( @xmath33 )",
    ", the @xmath0boson has a @xmath34 distribution in @xmath35 . at next  to",
    " leading order , the real emission of a single gluon generates a contribution to @xmath36 that behaves as @xmath37 and @xmath38 while the leading order , soft , and virtual corrections are proportional to @xmath39 . at higher orders , the most singular terms follow the pattern of @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the logarithms arise from the incomplete cancellation of the virtual and real qcd corrections , but this cancellation becomes complete for the integrated spectrum , where the real gluon can become arbitrarily soft and/or collinear to other partons .",
    "the pattern of singular terms suggest that perturbation theory should be performed in powers of @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 .",
    "this reorganization of the perturbative series is called resummation .",
    "the first studies of soft gluon emission resummed the leading logarithms @xcite , leading to a suppression of the cross section at small @xmath44 .",
    "the suppression underlies the importance of including sub  leading logarithms @xcite .",
    "the most rigorous approach to the problem of multiple gluon emission is the collins  soper  sterman ( css ) formalism for transverse momentum resummation @xcite , which resums all of the important logarithms .",
    "this is achieved after a fourier transformation with respect to @xmath44 in the variable @xmath13 , so that the series involving the delta function and terms @xmath42 simplifies to the form of an exponential .",
    "hence , the soft gluon emission is resummed or exponentiated in this @xmath13space formalism . to be more correct",
    ", the fourier transformation is the result of expressing the transverse  momentum conserving delta functions @xmath45 in their fourier representation .",
    "also , the exponentiation is accomplished through the application of the renormalization group equation , not by reorganizing an infinite sum of terms . despite the successes of the @xmath13space formalism",
    ", there are several drawbacks .",
    "most notable for the present study is that it integrates out the soft gluon dynamics and does not have a simple physical interpretation .",
    "the css formalism was used by its authors to predict both the total cross section to nlo and the kinematic distributions of the @xmath0boson to all orders @xcite at hadron colliders .",
    "a similar treatment was presented using the aegm formalism @xcite , that does not involve a fourier transform , but is evaluated directly in transverse momentum @xmath44 space .",
    "when evaluated at nlo , the two formalisms are equivalent to nnnl order in @xmath3 , and agree with the fixed order calculation of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "a more detailed numerical comparison of the two predictions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the aegm formalism has been reinvestigated , and an approximation to the @xmath13space formalism has been developed in @xmath44space which retains its predictive features @xcite ( see also the recent eprint @xcite ) .",
    "this formulation _ does _ have a simple , physical interpretation , and can be used to develop an alternate algorithm for parton showering which _ includes _ higher  order corrections to the hard scattering .    in the @xmath13space formalism , the differential cross section of the @xmath0boson produced in association with soft gluons is : = 1(2 ) ^2 _ ^ d^2 b e^i b ( b , q , x_1,x_2 ) + y(q_t , q , x_1,x_2 ) . in this expression ,",

    "note that the coefficients @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) are universal to @xmath83 annihilation into a color singlet object , just as the showering sudakov form factor only knows about the partons and not the details of the hard scattering . for @xmath84 fusion , only the coefficient @xmath79 ( 3 ) is universal . in general , at higher orders , the analytic sudakov is sensitive to the exact hard scattering process .",
    "while the sudakov form factors are similar , there is no one  to  one correspondence .",

    "we allow @xmath48 to shower with a maximum virtuality fixed at @xmath102 or @xmath112 , and include primordial transverse momentum for the incoming partons , so this cut is smeared out .",
    "ideally , however , no cut would be necessary , and this issue is left for future study .",
    "finally , we have only considered leptonic decays of the @xmath0 and the @xmath113 decay of the higgs boson ( to avoid any effects of final state radiation ) , but our final results are scaled to the total production cross section .",
    "our results for @xmath1 boson production are similar to those for @xmath0 boson production , so we do not comment on them further .    for our numerical results ,",
    "we present the @xmath44 distribution of the heavy boson produced at the tevatron .",
    "these distributions are in good agreement with analytic calculations , but can not be predicted accurately by the standard showering algorithm .",
    "secondly , we present jet properties for the same processes , which are not significantly altered from the predictions of the standard showering algorithm .",
    "these can not be predicted by analytic calculations .",
    "our first goal is to test the predictions of our showering algorithm on run i data . in fig .  1 ,",
    "the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson ( solid line ) is shown in comparison to d  data@xcite ( the three dashed lines show the data and the upper and lower error estimates ) .",
    "the modified pdf ( mpdf ) is calculated using cteq4 m pdf s . as in analytic calculations ,",
    "the position of the peak from the smc depends on non  perturbative physics @xcite . in ,",
    "this is implemented through a gaussian smearing of the transverse momentum of the incoming partons . to generate this plot ,",
    "we have changed the default gaussian width from .44 gev to 3.6 gev , which is more in accord with other analyses .",
    "this is the value used in all subsequent results .",
    "the numerical agreement between our prediction and the data is very good , except , perhaps , in the region of 3050 gev .",
    "boson production . ]",
    "our prediction in this region depends on the details of the correction @xmath105 , and any excess is probably related to the bad behavior of @xmath105 at very small @xmath44 .",
    "next , we present our results on the @xmath44 distributions for @xmath0 and higgs bosons ( @xmath114 gev ) produced at the tevatron in run ii .",
    "figure  2 displays the @xmath44 distribution of the @xmath0 boson at run ii generated using the modified version of .",
    "the solid line is the full distribution , and the dashed and dotted lines show the individual contributions from the corrected showering and the corrected hard emission ( @xmath48 ) piece . for reference",
    ", we show the @xmath44 distribution using the default version of  and cteq4l pdf s .",
    "because the maximum virtuality of the showering is set to the scale @xmath115 , the smc contributions are suppressed beyond @xmath116 .",
    "note how the @xmath48 piece fills in the intermediate @xmath44 region down to small @xmath44 , where showering gives the preferred result .",
    "the total cross section predicted by  is ( 18.2 , 20.5 , 23.9 ) nb using cteq4l , cteq4 m , and mpdf@xmath117 .",
    "the total increase in rate from lo to nlo is in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath118 tev .",
    "our numbers for @xmath119 tev ( 21.2 nb using mpdf+@xmath48 ) also agree with the cdf and d  data @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the mpdf calculation , without @xmath48 , yields nearly the same rate as using just the cteq4 m pdf ( 21.6 nb vs. 20.5 nb ) .",
    "this is anticipated by the smallness of the virtual correction in the wilson coefficients @xmath120 .",
    "however , this need not be the case for different processes or different colliders .    the results for the production of a higgs boson with mass @xmath114 gev is shown in fig .",
    ", the correction to the lowest order process is quite large .",
    "the total cross section predicted by  is ( 0.50 , 0.48 , 0.94 ) pb using cteq4l , cteq4 m , and the mpdf@xmath117 .",
    "the final number are in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . we have used a primordial @xmath121 tuned to run i data . however , if we believe that the non  perturbative function should have the same form as the perturbative sudakov form factor , then the primordial @xmath121 should scale like @xmath122 relative to the @xmath83 case @xcite , and the peak of the @xmath44 distribution would shift to the right .",
    "it is interesting to know if the kinematic distributions for the heavy bosons can be reproduced using the standard showering algorithms with a multiplicative @xmath123factor that yields the total nlo rate .",
    "figure  4 shows the ratio of the higgs boson transverse momentum distributions calculated from mpdf+@xmath48 to cteq4l times @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "there are variations as large as 10% in the important regions of small and medium @xmath44 .",
    "of course , the effect is much larger for the large @xmath44 region where there is almost no rate from the standard parton showering .      in figs .  5 , 6 and 7 , we present jet properties for the @xmath0 and higgs boson production processes .",
    "jets are defined using the cone clustering algorithm of the  subroutine pycell with a cone of size @xmath125 , @xmath126 gev , and @xmath127 . for @xmath0 boson production in fig .  5",
    ", we present the jet multiplicity distributions for all , @xmath128 gev , @xmath129 gev , and @xmath130 gev .",
    "we compare the showering predictions using mpdf ( solid line ) , cteq4 m ( dashed line ) , and cteq4l ( dotted line ) .",
    "to study the effects of the modified showering algorithm , we do not include @xmath48 , which would increase the @xmath131 bin of the mpdf prediction .",
    "all distributions are normalized to unity . from fig .  5",
    ", we see that the predictions have only minor differences , which is expected since the wilson coefficients for @xmath0 production are nearly unity .    for the case of higgs boson production in fig .",
    "6 , we study the regions @xmath132 gev , @xmath133 gev , and @xmath134 gev . there are more noticeable differences , and much more radiation in general than for the @xmath0 boson case .",
    "the higher order pdf s generate slightly more jet activity and yield similar distributions . in general ,",
    "though , there are no dramatic changes in the distributions .",
    "this is not too surprising , since the showering depends on the ratio of the modified pdf s evaluated at two different scales , which is not as sensitive to the overall normalization of the pdf .    from these examples , we learn that the use of the modified showering algorithm does not change the jet properties in a major way .",
    "figure 7 compares the differential jet transverse energy distribution in run i to cdf data . here",
    ", jets are defined with @xmath135 and are smeared with an energy resolution function @xmath136 ( in gev ) .",
    "we consider the agreement between theory and data to be further evidence that our nlo corrections reproduce jet properties .",
    "we have presented a modified , parton showering algorithm that produces the total cross section and the event shapes beyond the leading order .",
    "these modifications are based on the @xmath44space resummation .",
    "the parton showering itself is modified by using a new pdf ( called mpdf ) which encodes some information about the hard scattering process .",
    "simultaneously , the explicit , hard emission is included , but only after subtracting out the contribution already generated by the showering : this correction is called @xmath48 .",
    "the presence of @xmath48 yields a smooth transition from the parton showering to single , hard emission .",
    "we modified the  monte carlo to account for these corrections , and presented comparisons with run i @xmath0 boson data and predictions for @xmath0 and higgs boson production at the tevatron in run ii .",
    "the scheme works very well at nlo for the cases considered in this study , and the correct cross sections , transverse momentum distributions , and jet properties are generated .",
    "we have compared our kinematic distributions to the case when the results of the standard showering are multiplied by a constant @xmath123factor to reproduce the nlo cross section .",
    "we find variations on the order of 10% for small and medium transverse momentum .",
    "there are several effects which still need study .",
    "we have not included the exact distributions for the decay of the leptons @xcite for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , which are resummed differently .",
    "it is straightforward to include such effects . in the theoretical discussion and numerical results ,",
    "we have focussed on initial state radiation , but our results should apply equally well for final state radiation .",
    "the situation is certainly simpler , since final state radiation does not require detailed knowledge of the fragmentation functions . also , the case when color flows from the initial state to the final state requires study .",
    "a resummed calculation already exists for the case of deep inelastic scattering @xcite , and much theoretical progress has been made for heavy quark production @xcite .",
    "we believe that the modified showering scheme outlined in this study generalizes beyond nlo , just as the analytic calculations can be calculated to any given order .",
    "for example , we could include hard @xmath137 jet corrections @xcite to @xmath48 . for consistency",
    ", however , higher order terms ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) may also need to be included in the sudakov form factor .",
