    "stellar bars are recognized as the single most important _ internal _ factor which drives the evolution of disk galaxies both dynamically and secularly , modifying their morphology in this process .",
    "modern understanding of the bar growth is based on the efficiency of angular momentum exchange between the ( bar - forming ) inner disk and the surrounding dark matter halo , outer disk , bulge , and , to a certain degree , with the immediate galactic environment ( athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "a number of yet to be identified and investigated intricacies can affect the efficiency of this process .    in this work we attempt to analyze the formation and evolution of stellar bars embedded in fully grown disks in the presence of _ triaxial _ halos with various radial density profiles , from cuspy to flat - core models .",
    "we study both analytical ( i.e. , rigid ) and live triaxial halos and compare our results with the evolution of the bars in axisymmetric ones .",
    "corollaries for disk evolution , such as the back - reaction of disks and bars on the halo shapes , are investigated as well .",
    "this effect has broad implications for the cosmological evolution of galaxies .",
    "additional evolutionary effects on the 3-d structure of stellar bars embedded in such halos will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the evolution of bars is expected to be substantially altered if the surrounding halos are even mildly non - axisymmetric ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 , hereafter es02 ) .",
    "however , this effect in a live disk - halo system was not verified so far .",
    "competing gravitational torques from a bar and a halo acting on the main families of planar and 3-d periodic orbits can destabilize them and dramatically reduce their ability to trap neighboring trajectories , thus inducing chaos and dissolving otherwise stable structural features in disk galaxies .",
    "the full extent of these non - linear effects is not yet clear , but one can expect them to speed up secular changes in the collisionless components and to facilitate the angular momentum loss in the gaseous one . although triaxial shapes of dark matter halos appear inherent in the cosmological numerical simulations ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; frenk et al .",

    "potential _ axial ratios ( both flatness and prolateness and its prolateness ( i.e. , equatorial ellipticity ) as @xmath3 ) of about @xmath4 in cold dark matter ( hereafter cdm ) halos are plausible , even in _ present _ day galaxies ( e.g. , kuijken & tremaine 1994 [ for the milky way ] ; rix & zaritsky 1995 ; helmi 2004 ) .",
    "another evidence for triaxiality of the dm halo is provided by the x - ray isophote position angle twist observed by _",
    "chandra _ in ngc  720 ( but not in stellar isophotes ! ) ( buote et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a nearly prolate dm halo , with @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 @xmath7 ) has been inferred for the elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 from a kinematic study of planetary nebula system ( peng et al .",
    "we conjecture , therefore , that while some individual halo shapes are compatible with being mildly prolate even at the present time , the statistical significance of this effect is not clear , and it is not clear whether disk galaxies differ in this respect from ellipticals .",
    "overall , the prolateness of _ contemporary _ halos appears to be insignificant .",
    "the main motivation behind this work is that theoretically a galactic halo is expected to acquire its triaxial shape during its initial collapse and to support this shape during the ongoing process of a hierarchical merging .",

    "@xmath10 corresponds to a prolate halo , while @xmath11 to an oblate one ] will depend on the merging history , specifically on the relative angular momenta of the merger precursors and interaction frequency  which is difficult to quantify .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that at very high redshifts , at the epoch of galaxy formation , the halos can be significantly triaxial .",
    "detailed properties of individual numerical halos , such as triaxial shapes and radial density structure , can be extracted from the models and directly confronted by their observational counterparts .",
    "flatness and prolateness in the models appear to increase with the halo mass , being somewhat milder in the @xmath12cdm than cdm cosmology ( e.g. , for a recent review bullock 2002 ) .",
    "this triaxiality seems to be marginally higher in the outer halo parts , independently of the halo mass and of the ratio of rotational - to - dispersion velocity , indicating that the halos are supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions .",
    "the high halo triaxiality that may be present at the epoch of early galaxy formation can be substantially diluted by the present - day .",
    "for instance , the addition of spherical and/or axisymmetric baryonic components to the system ( e.g. , during the formation and development of a galactic disk ) can wash out the halo triaxiality , still keeping it non - negligible ( dubinski 1994 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 ) .    from an observational standpoint it appears that _ profiles _ of the dm halos in fully formed galaxies tend to have nearly constant density cores ( flores & primack 1994 ;",
    "moore 1994 ; burkert 1995 ; kravtsov et al . 1998 ; borriello & salucci 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; gentile et al . 2004 ; etc . ) .",
    "a sim ilar effect has been recently observed in galactic clusters ( sand et al . 2002 ) . at the same time , dissipationless cdm simulations of galactic halos agree with a universal density profile @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; warren et al . 1992 ; crone et al .",
    "1994 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; tormen et al . 1997 ; huss et al . 1999 ; fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al . 1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "2000 ; jing & suto 2002 ; power et al . 2003 ) .",
    "( note , jing & suto ( 2000 ) claim that the profiles are not universal . ) navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , hereafter nfw ) have found a fitting formula for the density profile of dm halos , for a wide range of cosmological models , in which the inner profile diverges as @xmath15 , while the outer profile drops as @xmath16 .",
    "it has been also demonstrated theoretically that a cuspy density profile arises inherently from the cold gravitational collapse in an expanding universe ( lokas & hoffman 2000 ) . the cdm model , therefore , predicts that the inner density profile of galactic scale dm halos is characterized by a density cusp while observations of the dynamics of the central regions of galaxies imply a core - halo structure of the dm .",
    "another disagreement with observations is the so - called angular momentum catastrophe  the @xmath17-body and gas dynamical simulations consistently result in too small galactic disks due to the overall lack of angular momentum necessary to reproduce the observed disk sizes ( e.g. , burkert & donglia 2004 ) .",
    "this controversy between observations of dm cores and density cusps in numerical models is not a fundamental one and can be resolved within the general context of cdm cosmology . within the conventional physics framework , interactions with the dissipative and clumpy baryonic component , such as dynamical friction , during the initial stages of collapse can level off the central density cusps ( which have been shown to be thermodynamically improbable ) and produce harmonic cores in dm halos ( el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 ) . even though this may affect the isodensity contours , making them rounder ,",
    "it need not symmetrize the isopotentials ; these can remain asymmetric if triaxiality is not affected beyond some radius ( for example , a uniform bar has a non - axisymmetric force contribution inside its density figure ) .",
    "more generally , this process was shown to replace the dm cusps with baryonic cusps ( el - zant et al .",
    "furthermore , asymmetric and flat core halos can have interesting implications for the disk growth and correlate the properties of the central supermassive black holes with those of galactic bulges and halos themselves ( el - zant et al .",
    "alternatively , the central density cusps have been proposed to dissolve by the action of galactic bars ( weinberg & katz 2002 ; but see mcmillan & dehnen 2005 ) .",
    "a number of approaches can be taken in order to construct triaxial halos and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , aarseth & binney 1974 ; merritt & valluri 1996 ; holley - bockelmann et al .",
    "2001 ; moore et al .",
    "2004 ) and to study the bar dynamics within triaxial halos .",
    "ideta & hozumi ( 2000 ) have used analytical density distributions for two highly prolate halos with ( equatorial ) axial ratios of 0.6 and 0.75 and a very steep density distribution outside the core .",
    "here we choose to construct stable triaxial models with a subsequent introduction of axisymmetric collisionless disks which are then released and their time evolution is observed . in our initial conditions we tend to follow es02 , who studied systematically the stability of stellar bars in _",
    "analytical _ halos of different triaxiality and central concentration by means of liapunov exponents . while in es02 approach the feedback from disk / bar system onto the halo",
    "is naturally ignored , our models presented here fully account for it .    in es02 ,",
    "mildly triaxial shapes have been used , with the gravitational potential axial ratios in the equatorial plane , @xmath9 , between 0.9 and 1.0 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the halo polar axis .",
    "a clear trend has been found , in the sense of models becoming intrinsically chaotic with growing triaxiality and central concentration . for small halo ( flat ) core sizes , @xmath20  kpc , and potential axis ratios of @xmath21 most of the trajectories integrated appeared chaotic and had large liapunov exponents .",
    "importantly , trapping by neighboring stability islands is insignificant , because the distribution of values of lyapunov exponents is very similar to the distribution of occupied configuration space volume .",
    "this means that stellar bars under these conditions would disintegrate on timescales of a few dynamical times , much shorter than the hubble time , as chaotic trajectories quickly diffuse out of the bar s configuration space .",
    "even spherically - symmetrical models , with a small core size , showed a healthy fraction of chaotic trajectories , though connected regions of regular orbits aligned with the bar remained in this case and a self - consistent bar could be maintained .",
    "what are the reasons for a dramatic increase in the fraction of chaotic orbits in the barred disks with the increase in central concentration ( i.e. , cuspiness ) and triaxiality in the halo models of es02 ? first , in terms of invariants of motion , a stable 3-d figure must be built from trajectories which at least approximately conserve them .",
    "the chaos appears when the number of invariants of motion becomes smaller that the dimensionality of the system . while in the flat core systems",
    ", the potential can be approximated as quadratic ( i.e. , harmonic ) and motions along the coordinates are independent of each other , in cuspy potentials these motions are coupled , which leads to the overall decrease in the number of invariants of motion and typically to a chaotic behavior . in other words , cuspy density distribution cause solutions for the poisson equation to be far from quadratic , i.e. , when the potential is expanded in power series , it will have a non - negligible contribution from terms beyond the quadratic one .",
    "these terms produce the coupling between different degrees of freedom in equations of motion which become highly non - linear .",
    "such systems are prime candidates to excite chaotic motions when perturbed .    the second reason is related to the time - dependent character of the azimuthal force field comprised from the fast rotating bar and a non- or slowly tumbling halo . in other words ,",
    "the origin of chaos in this case lies in the comparable ( in value ) and competing forces from the bar and the asymmetric halo .",
    "( note , that in a halo potential only , most of the orbits are regular , even in the triaxial case . )",
    "this onset of chaos in the presence of a bar within even a mildly triaxial halo hints that such configurations are structurally unstable on dynamical timescales .",
    "since numerical cosmological halos are both triaxial and centrally - concentrated , serious questions arise about the survival of large - scale stellar bars or of the halos s triaxiality under these conditions .",
    "this issue defines the general thrust of our work .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section we provide the initial conditions for numerical modeling .",
    "sections  3 and 4 describe our results for analytical and live models , and section  5 is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "we have introduced the following dimensionless model units .",
    "the spatial distance unit is taken as @xmath22kpc , the mass unit is @xmath23 and the gravitational constant is chosen to be @xmath24 , which result in a time unit of @xmath25yrs , corresponding to the dynamical timescale , @xmath26 . in these units , the velocity is given in @xmath27 .",
    "the actual physical units are used when it is needed for clarity .",
    "we have used version ftm-4.4 of @xmath17-body code ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1994 ; heller 1995 ) with @xmath28 particles and gravitational softening of 100  pc to simulate the collisionless disk and spheroidal galactic components ( i.e. , bulges and dm halos ) in a large number of models .",
    "our results appear to be reasonably independent of @xmath17 .",
    "the gravitational forces have been computed using dehnen s ( 2002 ) falcon force solver , a tree code with mutual cell - cell interactions and complexity _ o(n)_. it conserves momentum exactly and is about 10 times faster than optimally coded barnes & hut ( 1986 ) tree code .    to analyze the angular momentum redistribution in the models , we have applied the spectral analysis method described in binney & spergel ( 1982 ) , in conjunction with our nonlinear orbit finding algorithm ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1996 ) . athanassoula ( 2002 ) has shown that the angular momentum exchange between the disk and the halo is mediated by the lower resonances , with the disk losing and the halo gaining the angular momentum .",
    "overall , the resonances provide an independent test of the quality of the numerical scheme .",
    "when the @xmath17-body potential is too ` grainy ' , the particles can not be locked by the resonances and so the latter efficiency in redistributing the angular momentum is sharply reduced .",

    "stellar disk has been gradually introduced thereafter and the halo was been given time to relax again in this growing disk potential .",
    "the disk potential slightly changes the initial halo core size and therefore we apply an adiabatic cooling procedure to the halo particles within the core region , by gradually reducing the velocities . before introducing the disk for the triaxial cases ,",
    "we have implemented a similar adiabatic ` heating - cooling ' procedure to the halo particles to create a triaxial halo of required flatness and prolateness , by using ` heating ' of the velocities along the @xmath34-axis and ` cooling ' along both the @xmath35- and the @xmath36-axes , over some period of time , i.e. some @xmath37 .",
    "the fractional energy heating / cooling per dynamical time is very small , @xmath38 per machine timestep ( corresponding to about @xmath39 per dynamical time ) , so the system is never taken out of a dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the disk potential partially dilutes the halo triaxiality and therefore we apply a second heating - cooling procedure after the disc has been introduced in the models .",
    "this finally results in both the required @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions and core sizes in the halo potential ( fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] ) . note that in the models with smaller cores it is more difficult to impose ( and maintain ) the triaxiality at all radii .    for a direct comparison with es02 in this work",
    ", we aimed to closely reproduce their initial conditions . a 3-d mass distribution ( live or analytical ) which pairs with the nonrotating logarithmic potential , @xmath42 , ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) was used for the halo ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the asymptotic ( in the limit @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) circular velocity , @xmath47 is the halo core radius and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the azimuthal and polar potential axis ratios .",
    "note that the corresponding mass distribution is diverging for this potential .",
    "we , therefore , applied a truncation radius for models with live halos , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51kpc for the axisymmetric and triaxial halos , respectively .",
    "although the potential of these models is going to change , both as a result of the disk addition and , in the case of live halo response , to the disk evolution , we find it nevertheless beneficial to compare the evolving potential to the fitted logarithmic one . for spherical ( axisymmetric ) models @xmath52 , while for triaxial models @xmath53 and @xmath54 , approximately for live models , after the halo has relaxed in the disk potential .",
    "we have used two sets of initial halo models . in the _ first set _ , @xmath55 ( see table  1 )  for rigid halos only  we adjust @xmath44 requiring @xmath56 ratio of halo - to - disk mass within @xmath57 .",
    "this means that on the scale of @xmath58 models with different core size have the same mass concentration . on smaller scales of course the more cuspy models",

    "the only difference is that the growth rate is faster and so the peak strength is achieved earlier .",
    "the subsequent evolution , however , is very different  the bar dissolves over the characteristic time of @xmath98 , depending on the model , leaving only a weak oval distortion behind ( fig .",
    "the general trend of bar evolution in this sequence of models clearly links the halo cuspiness to the dissolution process , which is amplified by the halo triaxiality  a trend predicted by es02 based on the orbital stability analysis and the development of connected chaotic domains in these models    the bar size plot ( mid panels ) , which indicates a bar of @xmath99kpc in rt1 at later times , is misleading here and seems to represent only the disk response to the triaxial potential and the ellipticity is that of the disk .",
    "as long as the bars exist in these models , their pattern speeds mirror those in axisymmetric halos of the same mass concentration .    despite the destruction of bars in rt1 to rt5 models , the disk tends to acquire a double - valued radial exponential scalelength : the inner one of about 2  kpc and the outer one of @xmath100  kpc .",

    "the basic difference with the previous set of models is that halo mass within the central 10  kpc is increased for progressively smaller cores ( table  1 ) .",
    "thus , when moving from flat core to cuspy models , we move from a maximal disk model ( rs1 ) to a halo - dominated one ( rs3 ) as evident from fig .  2 .",

    "thereafter , @xmath75 drops and the bar further weakens to a rather oval distortion which persists over the period of simulations .",

    "the bar pattern speed correlates with the halo s mass concentration , i.e. increasing with smaller core sizes .",
    "pattern speed in rs3 is linearly decreasing with time reflecting the secular increase in @xmath75 .    to summarize the sequence of rigid axisymmetric halos rs1@xmath101rs3 : the stellar bar is basically supressed in more cuspy models in accordance with es02 analysis .",
    "models ls1 to ls3 present the case of live axisymmetric and increasingly cuspy halos . after introducing the disk and letting the halo to relax ,",
    "we have fitted the halo density profile at the end of this relaxation process using the parameters of logarithmic potential , @xmath44 , @xmath47 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( see table  [ table : models ] ) .",
    "the new density profiles for the halo can be fit reasonably well and show slight increase in @xmath44 and unchanged @xmath106 .",
    "owing to the flattened disk potential @xmath107 slightly decreases . for model ls1 ,",
    "the core radius remained at @xmath108  kpc , for model ls2 it decreased to @xmath109  kpc , and for model ls3  to some @xmath110  kpc .",
    "the main difference between these models and the previously discussed ones with rigid halos , however , is an active redistribution of angular momentum between the bar forming region in the disk and the live halo ( see section  4 ) . for all",
    "live axisymmetric halos during disk evolution the halo density profile is stable ( e.g. , as shown for ls3 in fig .",
    "the sequence ls1@xmath111ls3 has produced the strongest bars among all of our models ( fig .",
    "the amplitude @xmath75 has also shown a pattern of behavior : ( 1 ) the bar growth is fastest in ls1 ( disk dominated ) and slowest in ls3 ( halo dominated ) ; ( 2 ) the maximal bar strength is increasing along the sequence ; ( 3 ) all bars exhibit vertical buckling , ( 4 ) @xmath75 decays most strongly in ls1 after the buckling , and least in ls3 ; and finally ( 5 ) the post - buckling bar in ls1 continuous its secular growth , which quickly saturates in ls2 and starts to decay in ls3 .",
    "hence ls1 ( and to a lesser degree ls2 ) shows most resemblance to the secular evolution of a stellar bar in martinez - valpuesta , shlosman & heller ( 2006 ) where the bar weakens dramatically during its buckling and increases its strength thereafter .",
    "for model  ls1 , the bar size decreases from roughly @xmath97kpc just before the buckling , to @xmath112kpc at @xmath113 and then increases again to about @xmath114kpc after the buckling . for model  ls3",
    ", it grows from @xmath115kpc to @xmath116kpc .",
    "this means that during the initial growth , up to the time of the buckling , the bar is confined to the regular region delineated in es02 .",
    "the bar sizes show clear correlation with the halo core size , @xmath47 , as in the rigid sequence rs1 @xmath101 rs5 described in section  3.1 .",
    "one can clearly observe here the ` delay ' in the bar growth in halo - dominated models .",
    "the bar ellipticity shows a visible decay after the buckling in ls1 and stabilizes afterwards , while in ls2 and ls3 @xmath84 does not decay .",
    "as expected , the bars slow down substantially over the simulation time and the initial slowdown is well correlated with @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ plot3 ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "this angular momentum transfer from the disk is deposited mostly in the internal circulation in the halo as its figure does not acquire rotation ( section  4 ) .",
    "we have mentioned above that all ls models show buckling which is less pronounced for halo - dominated models .",
    "this can be noted from the amplitudes of the vertical modes  ls1 shows clear increase of @xmath117 , and ls2 and 3 only in @xmath81 and @xmath115 .",
    "the disk evolution in ls models again leads to a double - exponential scalelength : the inner bar - dominated part has @xmath91 which slightly decreases from ls1 to ls3 , from @xmath105  kpc to @xmath90  kpc , while the outer disk scalelength actually increases along the sequence , from about 5  kpc to just below 6  kpc .",
    "the disk scaleheight in ls1 shows an abrupt increase at @xmath118 from its initial value 0.5 to about 0.9kpc within few dynamical times , during the vertical buckling of the bar .",
    "this effect is clearly related to the formation of a pseudo - bulge , i.e. , bulge of a boxy / peanut shape .",
    "ls2 experiences a milder increase in @xmath94 to @xmath119  kpc and in ls3 it remains largely unchanged .",
    "all ls models show the formation of pseudo - bulges associated with the vertical buckling of the bars .",
    "however the shapes of these bulges differ and this difference persists for the time of the simulations . while in model ls1 and ls2 the isodensity contours show a more boxy shape , the cuspy model , ls3 develops a peanut - shaped bulge ( see also athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ) .",
    "the rt1@xmath101rt3 sequence describes the disk evolution within rigid triaxial halos with decreasing core size , closely following the initial conditions in es02 ( fig .",
    "the only difference between the previously discussed rt1@xmath101rt5 sequence and rt13 is that the latter one is progressively halo - dominated .",
    "this difference is responsible for the damping of bar instability in a disk embedded in rt2 and rt3 halos .",
    "even rt1 shows a substantial decay of the initially strong bar to a largely an oval distortion , unlike the bar in rs1 model .",
    "hence , asymptotically rt2 and rt3 behave as rt4 and rt5 .",
    "however , early in the disk evolution , the former models show strong bars ( see section  3.2.1 ) .",
    "the size and ellipticity of the central ( bar ) oval distortion in rt1 to rt3 correlate well with @xmath47 . in rt1 ,",
    "the maximal bar length is @xmath120kpc at @xmath121 and after @xmath122 , the bar deteriorates into a rather triaxial ( in the equatorial plane ) configuration within the central @xmath123kpc .",
    "note the @xmath75 amplitude becomes finite already in the first moments into the simulation because of the disk response to the halo triaxiality .",
    "the first few disk rotations , especially in rt2 and rt3 , show a grand design spiral structure in the outer disk which remains tightly bound and quickly decays .",
    "even more than in rs3 , the disk stays largely axisymmetric within the central few kpc after @xmath124 .",
    "its surface density profile shows ( almost ) no evolution .",
    "the outer disk radial scalelength decreases to about 4.55kpc , while the disk scaleheight stays unchanged .      as in the case of the live axisymmetric halos ,",
    "the triaxial halos are modified by the introduction of the frozen disk potential . at the moment of disk ` release , ' the halo core size in model lt1 has slightly increased to @xmath125  kpc , in lt2 it has increased to @xmath126  kpc , and in lt3 stayed at @xmath66  kpc ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we found it increasingly difficult to maintain the ( inner ) halo triaxiality in cuspy models after introduction of a frozen disk .",
    "this has affected the lt3 model which possesses a more structurally unstable halo .",
    "the evolution of @xmath75 amplitude in the lt1@xmath101lt3 sequence is remarkably different from that in the rigid sequence rt1 to rt3 .",
    "the initial disk response to the halo potential has induced strong bars in all these models .",
    "the fate of the bar , however , differs depending on the model .",
    "the bars decay nearly linearly in lt1 and lt2 on a timescale of @xmath127 , and enter a steady state in lt3 .",
    "overall , the lt3 model behaves differently and its evolution resembes more the ls3 model , although the bar is not so strong .",
    "the buckling is clearly visible in all lt models .",
    "however , the resulting boxy shapes of bulges are quickly erased in lt1 and lt2 , while peanut shape bulge in lt3 persists till the end of the simulation .",
    "the planar @xmath80 amplitude is negligible in all live halo models .",
    "the radial density profile in the triaxial halo is stable during live disk evolution in all these models , even for the cuspy lt3 .",
    "however the halo triaxiality @xmath128 is reduced sharply in lt3 , due to decrease in @xmath129 .",
    "after @xmath130 , it has largely lost its prolateness , @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "this halo axisymmetrization is only partially a result of initial conditions  lt3 has had somewhat larger @xmath106 at @xmath132 , as noted above .",
    "rather , as we discuss in section  5 , the halo is much more structurally unstable in cuspy models . in order to test this latter assumption",
    ", we have re - run the lt2 model with a _",
    "frozen _ disk .",

    "both halo flatness , @xmath133 , and its prolateness , @xmath134 , show no evolution over 300 dynamical times , @xmath135  gyrs .",
    "this confirms that it is the developing bar perturbation which decreases the halo prolateness without much effect on its flatness .",
    "the bar size and ellipticity lt1 and lt2 ( fig .",
    "9 ) represent a combined disk and bar evolution .",
    "the outer disk develops elaborate system of long - lived spiral arms , much more pronounced than in live axisymmetric models . because of the difficulty to disentangle between the bar , spiral arms and the oval disk , the estimated bar size in fig .",
    "9 is erroneous .",
    "the inner disk radial scalelength shows a general decrease to about 1.7  kpc in lt1 and to @xmath109  kpc in lt2 and lt3 .",
    "the outer disk has @xmath91 approaching @xmath136  kpc in lt1 and about @xmath137  kpc in lt2 and lt3 .",
    "the inner disk scaleheight increases abruptly to @xmath138  kpc after @xmath139 in lt1 and to @xmath140  kpc in lt2 and @xmath141  kpc lt3 models .",
    "the live triaxial models are especially efficient in triggering the spiral structure in the barred disk .",
    "the arms penetrate deeper towards the center in lt2 model with smaller core radius .",
    "the strength of the spirals depends on the position angle of the bar with respect to the longest halo axis  when the bar is normal to this axis , the spirals are prominent .",
    "this type of spiral regeneration happens as long as the bar exists .",
    "models lt1 to lt3 show that the disk ( and bar ) response to a live triaxial ( halo ) potential can act as to decrease its prolateness , e.g. , equatorial ellipticity .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in model lt3 , where it has been difficult to induce the halo s triaxiality , especially in its central region .",
    "compared to the models with larger cores , the disk in lt3 evolves more similarly to that in axisymmetric halos . because of the strong feedback of stellar bars onto the halo triaxiality",
    ", we have run a model for lt3 with a continuous support for triaxiality  the lt3mt model .",
    "the simple justification for this is that mergers will induce triaxiality in the extended dm halos in the first place .",
    "we , therefore , mimic this process by maintaining or continuously regenerating a mild halo triaxiality , and at the same time allowing the live halo to interact with the live disk .",
    "12 ( right ) exhibits such an evolution of lt3mt and provides @xmath75 from lt3 for a comparison . the adiabatic heating / cooling procedure was gradually turned on and has its full strength from @xmath142 to 225 , when it is gradually turned off .",
    "initially , the lt3mt evolved identically to lt3 .",
    "because the halo triaxiality has been maintained at the steady level ( table  1 ) , it has a profound effect on the disk .",
    "the bar completely dissolves and starts to grow afterwards when the triaxiality is gradually washed out .      the interaction between the halo and the evolving disk tends to gradually wash out the initial triaxiality in the halo .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the disk - to - halo mass ratio .",
    "the bar is then able to grow within the region in which the halo becomes more axisymmetric . to show explicitly the dependency of halo and disk evolution on their ( inner ) mass ratios , we have run live triaxial models with lower disk - to - halo mass ratio within central 10  kpc for the cuspy lt3 model .",
    "here we show only lt3hm  the model with a half disk mass . the bar instability in this model",
    "is substantially suppressed compared to lt3 model .",
    "lt3hm develops a weak oval distortion in the center ( fig .  12 , left ) whose shape depends strongly on its orientation with respect to the halo major axis  its ellipticity is smaller when it is normal to the halo , and larger , when it is parallel .",
    "otherwise , the disk is stable and no bar instability develops .",
    "the general direction of the angular momentum flow in all models is expected to be from the inner bar - forming disk towards the outer disk and the halo .",
    "this reflects behavior of all models that break their axial symmetry for whatever reason , that of initial conditions ( triaxial halos ) or as a result of a spontaneous bar instability .",
    "however , when this redistribution is mediated by the bar , there is also an additional flow from the inner disk ( inside the bar corotation ) to the outer disk .    in the models with rigid axisymmetric halos",
    "the exchange of angular momentum is limited to that between the inner and outer disks , across the corotation and mediated by the bar .",
    "models rs1 and rs5 ( fig .",
    "13 ) show that the total loss of the angular momentum from the disk is @xmath143 and that the outer disk disk gains the angular momentum from inner part .",
    "this gain is larger for rs5 as it develops stronger bar .",
    "rigid triaxial models drain some of the angular momentum from the disk ( e.g. , rt5 in fig .",
    "13 ) but this does not dominate the @xmath144-exchange because of the mild triaxiality here .",
    "14 shows the effect of introduction of a live halo , axisymmetric and triaxial .",
    "the total loss of the @xmath144 by the disk has been dramatically amplified compared to the rigid triaxial halos .",
    "the outer disk still gains the same amount but most of @xmath144 goes to the halo .",
    "the strong and long - lived bar developing in the ls1 model is instrumental in this transfer .",
    "the main difference with the lt1 model is that the disk immediately acquires a strongly oval shape which is gradually lost and so overall the transfer amount of angular momentum is less than in ls1 .",
    "however , during the first 2030 dynamical times , the @xmath144-transfer is stronger in lt1 .",
    "subsequently , the bar which has developed in lt1 dissolves , which levels off the rate of angular momentum trasfer .",
    "furthermore , in order to test the effect of the resonance coupling between the disk / bar and the halo , we have performed the spectral analysis of the orbital motion ( binney & spergel 1982 ) in conjunction with our nonlinear orbital finder algorithm ( heller & shlosman 1996 ) .",
    "we find that a fraction of disk particles in live axisymmetric halos is locked by the lower resonances , especially by the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "a fraction of the halo particles is locked by the corotation resonance  hence ilr - cr resonance coupling .",
    "following athanassoula ( 2002 ) , we have frozen the model potentials at times @xmath145 and 150 , and compared the angular momentum of individual particles at these times .",
    "most of the angular momentum flow between the disk and the halo was mediated by this ilr - cr coupling .",
    "particles trapped at @xmath145 largely remained trapped at 150 .",
    "this result shows that the adverse effect of the grainy @xmath17-body potential on the evolution in our models is limited , and the latter is driven by a chaotic dynamics instead .",
    "we have analyzed the formation and evolution of stellar bars in galactic disks embedded in rigid ( i.e. , analytical ) and live axisymmetric and mildly - triaxial dm halos of a varying cuspiness .",
    "the nearly axisymmetric potential employed in our simulations allows us to focus on the development of bar instability _ per  se _ and does not violate the overall dynamics and survival of the disks . using tailored numerical simulations we aimed at testing and extending the predictions of el - zant & shlosman ( 2002 , es02 ) which employed the method of liapunov exponents to address the fate of bars in analytical triaxial halos .",
    "our simulations of live halos , unlike es02 , include the feedback between the disk , bar , and halo .",
    "we fully support the main conclusions of es02 and provide some additional insight into the bar and disk evolution .",
    "we start with summarizing our results and follow up with discussion  based on the bar strength . in all cases we can separate the initial bar growth to its full strength , over @xmath146  gyr , from the subsequent bar evolution , dynamical or secular , over the hubble time .",
    "the first stage is very similar between all _ rigid _ axisymmetric and triaxial halo models .",
    "we find , that while some of the rigid halos suppress the bar formation , depending on the disk - to - halo mass ratio d / h within the disk radius , all live halos develop impressive bars with ellipticities in the range of @xmath147 , depending on their evolutionary stage . in axisymmetric live cases ( only ! )",
    "these bars appear stronger for smaller d / h , in line with athanassoula & misiriotis ( 2002 ) .",
    "in live halos , the bars develop faster in triaxial compared to axisymmetric halos .",
    "( this statement is marginally true also for rigid halos . )",
    "all bars weaken at the end of the first stage .",
    "this process is accompanied by bar s vertical buckling in the live halos and formation of exponential ( pseudo- ) bulges of a peanut or boxy shape .",
    "no buckling is observed in rigid halos .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the bar differs substantially between axisymmetric and triaxial halos . in the former case ,",
    "the bars appear dynamically stable and show a limited secular evolution by a factor of @xmath148 in strength , in growth or decay after the initial vertical buckling .",
    "this result is in agreement with athanassoula ( 2002 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the bars dissolve almost completely on a timescale of @xmath149  gyr , sometimes leaving behind a weak oval distortion in the central regions .",
    "this is true for all models with the exception of lt3  a live cuspy triaxial halo , where the triaxiality ( i.e. prolateness ) is erased early due to the feedback from the bar and its ensuing evolution closely resembles that of the axisymmetric halos .    to verify that the bar endurance is related to the erasure of the halo prolateness",
    ", we have run a test model where ( live ) halo triaxiality in lt3 has been maintained at a constant level .",
    "the bar dissolved in this case as expected . on the other hand , to show that the evolution of halo prolateness is due to destabilizing action of the bar , we run models with a frozen axisymmetric disk in live triaxial halos  these models show basically no evolution for @xmath134 .",
    "we have also run a number of test models with the lt3 halo but smaller d / h mass ratio .",
    "models with d / h@xmath150 , formed only a weak oval distortion .",
    "this is unlike the trend in the axisymmetric live halos , where small d / h resulted in stronger bars .",
    "we discuss this below .",
    "the bar sizes appear to correlate with the halo core sizes , with the exception of live triaxial models where the bar size is more difficult to establish due to the strong response in the disk and a quick bar dissolution .",
    "the bar ellipticities provide additional source of information on the bar strength and even more about the state of the disk when the bar amplitudes measured by @xmath75 decay below 0.1 .",
    "the pattern speeds of bars anticorrelate with halo core sizes  more centrally concentrated halos produce faster tumbling bars .",
    "however , the deceleration rate of the bar anticorrelates with the halo core sizes as well  thus , after the hubble time , the end pattern speed of the bars is similar .",
    "as expected , bars in rigid halos quickly reach constant pattern speeds , while bars in live halos continue to slow down asymptotically .",
    "interestingly , bars in live axisymmetric halos can become stronger or weaker while slowing down .",
    "bars in live triaxial halos always weaken and dissolve while slowing down .",
    "in rigid halos , the angular momentum of the inner disk is fed into the outer disk , across the bar corotation .",
    "some angular momentum is lost to the halo in rigid triaxial models . in live models",
    ", the halo appears to gain angular momentum , more so fractionally in triaxial models .",
    "we have verified that in axisymmetric models the angular momentum is mediated by lower resonances , especially by the inner lindblad resonance in the disk and by the corotation resonance in the halo .    in triaxial models , as long as a bar is present ,",
    "the disk evolution is characterized by development of a strong spiral structure outside the bar region .",
    "it is especially prominent in live triaxial halos .",
    "the outer disk acquires exponential surface density distribution , while the inner ( bar - unstable ) part can be modeled roughly by a shorter exponential scalelength when measured along the bar major axis .",
    "our emerging understanding of the evolution of bars embedded in live , mildly triaxial or axisymmetric halos is based on two physical processes which determine the fate of the system .",
    "these are the angular momentum redistribution in the disk - halo system and the development of chaos .",
    "we can make a general statement that angular momentum flows from the bar unstable region in the disk to the outer disk and the halo .",
    "this process is accompanied by the initial growth of the bar both in strength and in size . in axisymmetric halos",
    ", it ultimately saturates and the bar enters a steady - state phase characterized by secular changes ( athanassoula 2003 ) . instead",
    ", in a mildly triaxial halo which hosts a barred disk , the dominant process is the increase in the fraction of chaotic trajectories  it affects both the bar and halo structures . in other words ,",
    "no steady - state develops , and either the bar is dissolved or halo prolateness is washed out . this effect on the bar embedded in a",
    "rigid _ triaxial halo has been calculated in es02 , and here we have presented fully self - consistent numerical simulations accounting for the bar and _ live _ halo evolution .    after the submission of this work we have learned about the work by curir et al .",
    "( 2005 ) where stellar disks have been evolved within the cosmological dm halos , albeit at much lower resolution than in our work . in these simulations ,",
    "the bars form in responce to the original torquing by the halo , but , contrary to our main results , survive for the rest of the simulation .",
    "we strongly suspect that this different behavior of bars results from the loss of prolateness by dm halos in their models , similarly to our model lt3 . furthermore , it is the process of introduction of disk into the halo which is also responsible for washing out the halo prolateness ( section  2.1 ) , which required us to apply the second heating - cooling procedure .",
    "unfortunately , curir et al . do not provide any analysis of the shape of their halos after bringing up the disks and during their subsequent evolution .",
    "their table  1 refers to purely dm halos without stellar disks only .",
    "thus we expect that the combination of halo triaxiality and its cuspiness in conjunction with a fast rotating bar will lead to the development of chaos and to the dissolution of the least massive or structurally stable triaxial feature in the system , i.e. , the bar or halo triaxiality . in section  1",
    "( see also es02 and refs .",
    "therein ) , we have argued that cuspy density distribution cause solutions for the poisson equation to be far from quadratic and this will produce the coupling between different degrees of freedom in equations of motion which become highly nonlinear  a prime recipe to develop a chaotic behavior when such a system is perturbed .    to understand the results of these numerical simulations within the context of developing chaos in a triaxial system with a fast tumbling stellar bar , we take the next step and discuss the evolution of the bar strength in terms of the stability of trajectories used by es02 .",
    "ultimately bars and other morphological features , such as prolate halos , dissolve when the density figure stops to support the figure of the background potential , in other words when self - consistency of density - potential pair is violated . as mentioned in section  1 , a stable 3-d figure must be built from trajectories which at least approximately conserve the invariants of motion .",
    "chaos appears when the number of invariants of motion becomes smaller that the dimensionality of the system .",
    "two issues appear most relevant in this respect : the overall asymmetry of the background potential and the degree of mass concentration .",
    "stability of trajectories for potentials and density distributions used in this work have been analyzed in es02 by calculating the liapunov exponents on a high - resolution 3-d cylindrical grid .",
    "these exponents provide a measure of timescales which are associated with dynamical instabilities and are especially suitable to study development of chaotic motions in time - dependent potentials ( see detailed description of this method in sections  1 , 2 and the appendix of es02 ) .",
    "the mapping of halos which are under consideration here using the liapunov exponents has shown that triaxial halos are regular in the absence of a bar  the top panel of fig .",
    "6 in es02 indicates that trajectories within this potential are stable well over the hubble time .",
    "this is supported by live models of triaxial halos presented here .",
    "all the models appear stable unless bar - unstable disks are added , _ even the cuspy halo in _",
    "lt3 , as expected .",
    "it is the addition of a ( triaxial ) bar fast tumbling with respect to the halo , which destabilizes the trajectories and triggers the chaos .",
    "the middle panels in fig .  6 of es02 show this effect in a cuspy halo",
    " most of the configuration space becomes chaotic with the characteristic timescale @xmath151  gyr .",
    "moreover , the chaotic regions are fully connected , thus providing a strong indication that survival of any non - axisymmetric structure is highly questionable .",
    "the less cuspy barred models of es02 show progressively less chaotic regions , especially in the flat cores , and the existing chaos is less interconnected .",
    "a self - consistent bar - disk model of pfenniger ( 1984 ) , without a surrounding halo , shows chaotic regions confined to the bar corotation radius ( lower panels , fig .",
    "6 of es02 ) , in line with the above explanation .",
    "we also note that the remarkable correspondence between the distributions of the available configuration space volume for the trajectories in es02 and the maximal liapunov exponents points out that the nearby stability islands are not efficient in trapping the chaotic trajectories .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the predicted bar dissolution in es02 models will indeed be observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the sequences , rt1@xmath101rt3 and rt1@xmath101rt5 discussed in section  3 represent a gradual increase in the halo cuspiness , i.e. , increased central mass concentration and progressively smaller size of the halo core . figs .  3 and 6 of es02",
    "demonstrate that the regular ( stable ) region shrinks from @xmath100  kpc in rt1 to about 0.5  kpc in rt3 , along with the increased halo cuspiness , not leaving much space for the bar to survive . when the bar feedback onto the halo is fully accounted for , i.e. , in live triaxial halos",
    " they also lose part of their asymmetry ( prolateness ) @xmath134 , but most of it remains .",
    "this explains why bars in lt1 and lt2 models behave qualitatively similarly to those in rigid rt models  all of them exhibit the bar dissolution .",
    "the main difference between these models and the cuspy lt3 is that cuspy halos are more structurally unstable , as we discussed above , and their prolateness is washed out early enough to allow for the bar to develop in a nearly axisymmetric environment .",
    "we confirm that either the onset of chaos dissolves the bar ( e.g. , lt1 and lt2 ) or it destroys the halo prolateness ( e.g. , lt3 ) .",
    "we strongly suspect that this latter process of is also at work in curir et al .",
    "( 2005 ) simulations of cosmological halos , allowing for long - lived bars . therefore , to some extent long - lived bars are incompatible with the high ( equatorial ) asymmetry in the dm halos . even the mild asymmetry observed in some halos of nearby galaxies is sufficient to shorten the bar lifetime to @xmath152  gyrs .",
    "this provides an interesting constraint on halo shapes , when taken in tandem with recent observational results . using @xmath153-based morphologies and accurate redshifts from the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems ; rix et al .",
    "2004 ) survey , jogee et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter j04 ; 2005 ) recently showed that the optical fraction and distribution of structural properties for bars with moderate - to - high strength ( @xmath154 ) remain similar from the present - day , out to look - back times of @xmath155  gyr ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "j04 argue that these findings imply that on average bars have a long lifetime , well in excess of 2  gyr .",
    "a constant optical bar fraction out to @xmath2 is also reported independently from a smaller survey by elmegreen et al .",
    "the simulations in this paper , when combined with these empirical results on a relatively constant fraction of bars out to @xmath2 and an inferred long bar lifetime , put a lower limit on the halo equatorial axial ratio @xmath157 of 0.9 ( in potential axes ) at the redshift range of @xmath158 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to ( @xmath9)@xmath159 axial ratio in _ density _ distribution .",
    "the disappearance of triaxial halos with @xmath160 in disk galaxies at @xmath161 seems as a corollary to our numerical simulations , when supplemented with the above observational results . as discussed in section  1 , while cosmological simulations of dissipationless cdm galactic halos invariably produce triaxial halos , the triaxiality of the halo can be subsequently diluted by the addition of baryonic components .",
    "this is likely to happen , for instance , during the early formation and development of a galactic disk .",
    "furthermore , this trend will be supported by a general decrease in the frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers below @xmath162 .",
    "we note the following caveat : the halo prolateness in our modeled halos is ( partially or fully ) washed out by the action of the bar which leads to a dramatic increase in the fraction of chaotic orbits  these can not support triaxial figures .",
    "it is the inner bar - forming part of the system where chaotic orbits dominate in asymmetric halos . in principle",
    ", we can envision the situation when the halo figure tumbles and trajectories which originate in its outer part can not penetrate deep enough toward the central regions where they are typically destabilized .",
    "such a halo will be more stable in preserving its prolateness , at least in its outer part .",
    "it is unclear how fast the halo must be tumbling for this effect to take place .",
    "such models are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "finally , we find it important to address the question to what extent the evolution of stellar bars in our @xmath17-body potentials of mildly triaxial halos is _ not _ a numerical artifact , i.e. , not a process driven by a numerical diffusion .",
    "in other words , can a poisson noise , associated with the discreteness of the @xmath17-body potential , be primarily responsible for the observed model bar dissolution , as opposed to the chaotic behavior triggered by the competing forces from the triaxial halo and a bar in es02 for smooth analytical potentials ?",
    "one can argue that that the graininess of the @xmath17-body potential is identical in the axisymmetric and triaxial halo models . because there is no indication that this potential has caused any numerical ` relaxation ' effects in the former models ,",
    "the latter ones will not be dominated by these effects as well . in principle , the consequences of the discreteness noise in the ` mixed ' ( triaxial halo / bar ) models , i.e. , models which are intrinsically more chaotic , can be more complex than in the axisymmetric models .",
    "nevertheless , albeit indirectly , this supports our point of view that it is the chaotic dynamics which drives the evolution of stellar bar in triaxial halos modeled here .    to provide the most direct answer to this question is to analyze the numerical models presented here in terms of lyapunov exponents of es02 , but this is outside the scope of our work and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "however , even if this approach will be taken , it is not without caveats as we deal here with a transient and not a classical chaos which is defined in the asymptotic limit and corresponds to an exponential divergence of a trajectory in a _ fixed _ potential ( e.g. , lichtenberg & lieberman 1995 ) .    in summary , we find that even a mild halo triaxiality of @xmath138 in potential axial ratio , dissolves the stellar bar on a timescale of @xmath152  gyr , sometimes leaving behind a weak oval distortion . especially in the live triaxial halos ,",
    "as long as a bar is present , strong spiral structure develop outside the bar and its strength depends on the mutual orientation of bars and the halo major axis . in comparable live axisymmetric halos , there is limited secular evolution , either growth or decay , of the embedded bars . in these cases ,",
    "the halo core sizes correlate directly with the bar sizes and their central mass concentration  with the bar pattern speeds .",
    "cuspy halos are more susceptible to washing out of their triaxiality due to the action of the bar , and the subsequent evolution is similar to that of axisymmetric halos , where the bar does survive .",
    "we have interpreted the bar evolution in live asymmetric halos , as well as in mildly triaxial and cuspy models in terms of the orbital structure , the development of chaos and the feedback between the halo , disk and bar .",
    "we find that damping of the bar instability in such halos puts a tight upper limit on halo prolateness in _ disk _ galaxies in the range of redshifts extending from the local universe to @xmath2 , in the light of recent results on a constant optical fraction of bar from the present - day out to these epochs .",
