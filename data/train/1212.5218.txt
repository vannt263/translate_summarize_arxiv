    "moreover , the doping - induced kinetic energy is better gained for the @xmath1 sc@xmath19 with the afm kitaev interaction because of the exchange term @xmath135 which is absent in the fm kitaev interaction . as the afm kitaev interaction is decoupled into both the singlet and the triplet channels , the @xmath1 sc@xmath13 could also be stabilized in the afm kitaev case .",
