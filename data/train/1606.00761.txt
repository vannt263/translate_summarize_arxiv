    "recently an extensive program of experiments with tagged photon beams of energies up to about 10 gev has started at tjnaf in the hall d. the prime aim of these experiments is to explore the qcd dynamics of mesons using polarized photon beams and proton targets .",
    "the high photon fluxes , photon tagging and good acceptance of the detector allow also to study various rare exclusive processes such as large angle photon - nucleon scattering with production of a meson and a baryon .",
    "it is presently a well accepted concept that the hadron fluctuates between various quark - gluon configurations since it is a quantum - mechanical system of quarks and gluons .",
    "various processes involving the hadron test various configurations .",
    "for example in @xmath2-channel processes , the wave length of the exchanged particle should match the size of a configuration .",
    "hence the hard binary processes , where not only the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy , @xmath4 , is large , but also @xmath5 , select the small - size configurations in the hadron",
    ". we will call that selection `` squeezing '' below and the selected color - neutral configurations ",
    "`` squeezed configurations '' .",
    "an extreme case of linear size much smaller than the average size is reached for the point - like configurations ( plc s ) .",
    "we will demonstrate here that exclusive hard two - body large c.m .",
    "angle processes with nuclear targets : @xmath6 would allow to address a number of important aspects of the qcd dynamics .",
    "we will focus on three questions : ( a ) at what momentum transfers , @xmath2 , does the transition from the regime in which the photon interacts as a vector meson to the one dominated by the contribution of unresolved ( i.e. point - like ) photon occur ? ( b ) how different are the interactions of different mesons ( baryons ) at energies of few gev ? ( c ) at what kinematics are the outgoing hadrons produced in the squeezed configurations and weakly interacting with other nucleons on the way out of the nucleus due to the color transparency ( ct ) ?",
    "note that we often refer to the squeezed configurations rather than to the plc s to emphasize that ct effects are likely to set in already when the linear size of the quark configuration is just @xmath7 smaller than the average size .",
    "comprehensive reviews of the ct can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the reactions of eq.([aqu ] ) also represent one of the best tools for study of the short - range correlations and non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of two - body large momentum processes remains a challenge for the qcd for a long time . in these processes , large momenta are transferred to the outgoing hadrons , so one may naively expect that the process should be described by the perturbative qcd .",
    "indeed , the quark counting rules @xcite based on the consideration of the lowest order qcd diagrams involving all constituents of the initial and final hadrons describe the energy dependence of the cross section at fixed c.m .",
    "scattering angle , @xmath8 , pretty well ( though the data are rather limited ) both for hadronic @xcite and photon @xcite projectiles : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of the constituents in the incoming and outgoing particles : @xmath11 a notable exception is the large angle compton scattering for which the cross section is found to drop as @xmath12 rather than @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "so far no successful calculations of the absolute cross sections were reported for the large c.m .",
    "angle scattering processes .",
    "the basic assumption of the quark counting rules is that the incoming and outgoing particles in the interaction point are in configurations with a much smaller than the average size  the plc s : @xmath14 .",
    "if a hadron propagates a long distance in a plc , the strength of the absorption would be strongly suppressed due to the color transparency property of the qcd  interaction of a color singlet small transverse size configuration is proportional to the area occupied by the color .",
    "hence , it was suggested to check the presence of squeezing in the large angle processes by studying their @xmath15-dependence @xcite . in the limit of strong squeezing ,",
    "the regime of full transparency was predicted : @xmath16 where we considered the process in which the elementary reaction involves scattering off protons .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in @xcite that the space - time evolution of the hadron wave packets involved in the hard interaction strongly reduces the transparency in a wide range of energies since even in the case when hadrons are squeezed to plc s in the point of hard interaction - these configurations are not frozen and expand increasing the chances of absorption .",
    "the ct was observed in high energy coherent diffraction of pion into two jets @xcite in line with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the transparency in the electroproduction of pions and @xmath17-mesons at tjnaf are consistent with the prediction of the models which include squeezing and quantum diffusion @xcite . at the same time the origin of the energy dependence of @xmath18 in the reaction",
    "@xmath19 remains unclear and there seems to be no evidence for the ct effects in the @xmath20 reaction in the @xmath21 range up to 8 gev@xmath22 studied so far @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the hard exclusive reactions in which mesons are involved are more promising for observing ct effects than other exclusive processes .",
    "photon beams provide an additional advantage as one can explore at what momentum transfers the transition from the dominance of vector - meson - like configurations ( resolved photon ) to the dominance of unresolved photons occurs  this transition may be referred to as the onset of the `` photon transparency '' . another advantage of the photon beams is variety of final states : _ mesons _",
    "= @xmath23 , _",
    "baryons_= @xmath24 which would allow to compare the properties of different hadrons .",
    "note here that the squeezing is expected also for a novel class of hard branching hadronic processes @xmath25 , where the hadrons @xmath26 and @xmath27 have large and nearly opposite transverse momenta and large invariant energy which is a finite fraction of the total invariant energy @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of such a reaction is the production of two mesons ( or a meson and a photon ) in the photon - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "color transparency effects are enhanced for these reactions as compared to two - body reactions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we summarize the basic formulae necessary for the calculation of the nuclear transparency . in section [ phototran ]",
    "we consider the photon transparency .",
    "it is shown that @xmath18 increases very significantly in the regime of photon transparency . in section [ inelcs ]",
    "we demonstrate that the discussed process with different final states would allow to perform a critical test of the constituent quark model by comparing the cross sections of inelastic interactions of different mesons - say pion and @xmath28 mesons .",
    "the estimates of the color transparency effect for the highest energies available at tjnaf are presented in section [ ct ] .",
    "our findings are summarized in section [ concl ] .",
    "we will consider the particular case of eq.([aqu ] ) when one of the outgoing particles is a nucleon .",
    "for the discussed reactions @xmath29 with an outgoing hadron @xmath30 and a nucleon @xmath31 , the transparency can be estimated in a semiclassical approximation taking into account the absorption due to the inelastic interactions of incoming and outgoing particles : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the coordinate along the direction of the photon momentum , @xmath34 is the impact parameter of the photon .",
    "@xmath35 represents the density of protons or neutrons , depending on which nucleon the hard process happens .",
    "the densities are normalized to the corresponding particle numbers : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the total nucleon density .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 are the effective absorption cross sections of the incoming and outgoing particles which may generally depend on the distance from the hard interaction point ( see below ) . @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the coordinates along the linear trajectories of the outgoing hadron @xmath30 and nucleon @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding initial values and impact parameters are determined by assuming the spherical symmetry of the target nucleus which gives : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "note that due to the spherical symmetry , the r.h.s of eq.([eq6.20 ] ) does not depend on the azimuthal angles of the outgoing particles ( which differ by @xmath48 ) , while their longitudinal and transverse momenta are fully determined by the kinematic invariants @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "here @xmath51 , and @xmath52 where @xmath53 mev is the removal energy of the nucleon at rest which includes the average binding energy of the nucleon ( @xmath54 mev ) and the excitation energy of the residual nucleus ( @xmath55 )",
    ". other choice of the nucleon removal energy , e.g. setting @xmath56 , practically does not influence the numerical results below , except the region of very large @xmath57 ( backward scattering ) which is not the main focus of this study .",
    "we will deal here with photon - nucleus reactions at @xmath58 gev / c where the photon coherence length , @xmath59 is comparable or larger than the medium - mass nucleus radius @xmath60 fm .",
    "this means that the photon coherently transforms to the @xmath17 meson which propagates the distance up to @xmath61 inside the nucleus before it experiences incoherent interaction with a nucleon producing the final hadron @xmath30 .",
    "as well known @xcite , the interference of this two - step process with the one - step process ( i.e. when the photon incoherently produces @xmath30 without any coherent interactions before ) leads to the modification of the effective mass number apart from the usual absorption factor for an outgoing particle . in rough approximation , this effect is expressed in eq.([eq6.20 ] ) as an absorption factor for the incoming photon which interacts with nucleons with effective cross section @xmath62 . however , this additional absorption is well established for the diffractive processes only , when the transverse momentum transfer is small .",
    "it is not clear a priori whether the photon behaves as a point - like particle or as a @xmath63 pair in the hard photoproduction processes studied here .",
    "thus we perform calculations in two regimes : in the `` resolved photon '' ( rp ) regime , the effective photon absorption cross section @xmath64 is applied , where @xmath65 is the inelastic pion - nucleon cross section . in the `` unresolved photon '' ( up ) regime , we set @xmath66 . in default case",
    "the up regime is assumed .      below , the calculation with vanishing hadron coherence length , @xmath77 ,",
    "will be referred to as a `` glauber '' one , while the calculation with @xmath78 of eq.([l_h ] )  as a `` quantum diffusion '' or `` ct '' one .",
    "all calculations are performed in the kinematics of the process @xmath79 .",
    "in soft intermediate energy hadroproduction processes the photon is usually treated as a superposition of hadronic states of moderate masses : the lightest vector mesons and higher mass states .",
    "the situation is expected to be different in the large angle exclusive production at sufficiently large energies since the cross section of the process in which the photon is resolved is suppressed by a factor @xmath80 as compared to the contribution of the unresolved photon ",
    "cf . eq.([counting ] ) with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the @xmath12 behavior of @xmath83 at a fixed angle represents the data over a wide range of angles for several exclusive processes @xmath84 studied there .",
    "note , however , that the data do not exclude a somewhat higher power of @xmath80 .",
    "the behavior consistent with the unresolved photon contribution appears to set in at @xmath85 .",
    "scattering off nuclei provides a sensitive probe of the transition from the rp to the up regime , as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : photran_t-2gev2],[fig : photran_u-2gev2 ] . in the rp regime",
    "the photon coherence length , @xmath86 , grows with increasing beam momentum , and the photon absorption region extends over large distances ultimately exceeding the nucleus diameter .",
    "this results in the moderate decrease and saturation of the transparency with growing @xmath87 .",
    "however , in the up regime the photon penetrates the nucleus without interaction up to the hard interaction point ( probability of its transition to a hadronic configuration during passing through the nucleus is suppressed by the small value of the fine - structure constant , @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , in this case the photon can interact with all nucleons near the back surface of the nucleus producing a pair of hadrons which can escape without absorption , leading to @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , in the resolved photon ( rp ) regime only the rim of the nucleus contributes into @xmath18 ( @xmath90 ) . as a result , under the up scenario",
    "the transparency is much higher than in the rp scenario in which the photon interacts in a hadronic configuration .",
    "moreover , the ratio of transparencies predicted by the up and rp models is expected to grow strongly with @xmath15 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "of course , the applicability of these qualitative estimates depends on the values of cross sections , nuclear density profiles etc .",
    "our numerical calculations of the nuclear transparency at @xmath92 gev / c , @xmath93 gev@xmath22 for the different nuclear targets with masses numbers between 12 and 208 can be well fit with the power law , @xmath94 where @xmath95 for the up regime and @xmath96 in the rp regime .",
    "thus , the above estimate ( @xmath97 ) should be taken as a lower limit for the nuclear transparency for the rp regime .",
    "the up and rp regimes strongly differ even at relatively small beam momenta , @xmath98 gev / c , since the photon coherence length @xmath86 , eq.([l_gamma ] ) , is large and the photon attenuation has a full strength within the range @xmath86 before the hard interaction point .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the pattern predicted in the color transparency regime ( cf .",
    "[ fig : photran_t-2gev2 ] and figs .  [",
    "fig : t_90deg]-[fig : t_t ] ) due to the hadron coherence length , @xmath78 ( eq.([l_h ] ) ) , being much smaller than the radii of heavy nuclei for the discussed photon energy range ( since the beam momentum is shared between the two produced hadrons ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that it would be feasible to study the transition to the photon transparency regime at tjnaf",
    ". it would be important to perform such studies for different channels - since the onset of this regime may depend on the quark composition ( @xmath99 vs @xmath28 mesons ) and the spin of the final hadrons ( @xmath99 vs @xmath17 mesons ) .",
    "as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : photran_u-2gev2 ] , in the kinematics with fixed @xmath100 , the corresponding transparencies are @xmath101 smaller than those at fixed @xmath102 .",
    "this is because in the former case the fast forward proton has larger inelastic cross section .",
    "the power law fit , eq.([powerlaw ] ) , of the mass dependence at @xmath92 gev / c , @xmath100 produces the values @xmath103 for the up regime and @xmath104 in the rp regime .",
    "the change of @xmath18 due to the photon transparency is similar for the kinematics with fixed @xmath2 and @xmath105 .",
    "however , since the onset of the photon transparency regime may start at different values of the momentum transfer in @xmath2- and @xmath105- channels , it would be desirable to study experimentally both @xmath106 and @xmath107 kinematics .",
    "it is well known that the additive quark model describes well the relations between cross sections of @xmath108 and @xmath109 scattering @xcite .",
    "however , there are indications that such relations should break for scattering of other mesons . for example , let us consider the cross section of @xmath110 interaction . in the quark model ( neglecting small non ideal mixing )",
    "@xmath111 hence , in the additive quark model @xmath112 where we took @xmath113 .",
    "this is much smaller than @xmath114 30 mb extracted from the measurements of the @xmath15-dependence of cross section of photon - nucleus interactions @xcite at @xmath115 gev .",
    "similarly , the measurements of @xmath116-meson absorption in photon - induced reactions at @xmath117 gev reported the values of @xmath118 35 mb @xcite which are much larger than @xmath119 10 mb expected in the additive quark model .    to quantify the strength of absorption in the discussed class of reactions one can measure the ratio of the transparencies for , say , @xmath116- or @xmath28-meson production and for the reference process @xmath120 for the same kinematics .",
    "for example , one can greatly reduce nuclear structure effects by considering the double ratio @xmath121 the results of our numerical calculations under assumption that the photon transparency ( i.e. up ) regime sets in already at @xmath122 are presented in fig .",
    "they indicate that the ratio of the nuclear transparencies is sufficiently sensitive to the difference between the interaction cross section of the produced meson with a nucleon and the @xmath123 cross section .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that there are many interesting channels in the large angle @xmath124 scattering with comparable cross sections : several @xmath123 channels , @xmath125 channel , a factor of @xmath126 larger @xmath127 channel @xcite .",
    "other interesting channels include @xmath128 channel which may have even larger cross section than the @xmath125 channel ( if the pattern observed in the @xmath48 - @xmath17- case holds for strange mesons ) , non - resonance two - meson production channel which may have a very large effective absorption cross section on the nucleon .",
    "in particular , we see that for the @xmath116-production the expected transparency should be @xmath129 larger than the transparency for the pion production .",
    "this is because at @xmath130 gev@xmath22 and @xmath131 gev / c the momentum of @xmath116 is @xmath132 gev / c , i.e. the @xmath133 invariant energy , @xmath134 gev , is well above the baryon resonance region .",
    "this makes us more confident that the additive quark model should work in this case .",
    "thus , the expected transparency for the @xmath28-meson production should be @xmath135 larger than the pionic transparency . other limiting case of small transparencies , @xmath136 of the pionic one ,",
    "is expected for the two - meson systems ( e.g. @xmath137 ) .",
    "hence , the study of the @xmath15-dependence of the ratio of transparencies would provide an important test of the interpretation of the data .",
    "the large angle processes are a natural place for looking for the ct effects at the intermediate energies since the unresolved photon can interact with small configurations without significant suppression .",
    "the space - time evolution of the small - size configurations in mesons was also tested in the studies of the @xmath21 dependence of the exclusive electroproduction of pions @xcite and @xmath17-mesons @xcite at tjnaf .",
    "hence , we can test the sensitivity of the nuclear transparency to this effect .",
    "similar to the previous studies we use the model discussed in section [ formalism ] .",
    "we vary the parameter @xmath73 to estimate the uncertainties of our predictions . in principle",
    ", we could have taken the different values of @xmath73 for a meson and a baryon , but it seems not necessary to estimate the magnitude of the expected effect .",
    "we should emphasize here that we do not modify the basic assumption of the model for @xmath138 that the squeezing is starting at @xmath139 .",
    "though this assumption is in line with the tjnaf data on the meson production , it may be too optimistic for the baryon case , cf .",
    "discussion in section [ intro ] and in the review @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_90deg ] we display the nuclear transparency at @xmath140 .",
    "the glauber model calculation produces almost flat @xmath87-dependence of the transparency while the ct effects in the quantum diffusion model lead to a rather strong increase of the nuclear transparency with beam momentum .",
    "we see that at @xmath141 gev the transparency is larger by @xmath142 due to the ct effects both for light and heavy nuclear targets .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_t ] we present the transparency calculated at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that the choice of @xmath143 gev@xmath22 leads to the fall of the transparency at small beam momenta in both calculations , pure glauber one and quantum diffusion one .",
    "this is due to the increased absorption for the forward - backward kinematics at large @xmath144 and small @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of scattering at @xmath140 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : t_90deg ] lower panel ) one of the particles does not propagate through the nucleus in peripheral collisions .",
    "the relative ct effect at large beam momenta is somewhat stronger for the case of @xmath140 since in this case the coherence lengths of the both outgoing particles grow with beam momentum , while at @xmath143 gev@xmath22 the momentum of the outgoing proton is fixed to @xmath98 gev / c and , thus , its coherence length is also fixed to @xmath146 fm .    fig .",
    "[ fig : t_plab ] displays the transparency @xmath18 as a function of @xmath57 at the fixed beam momentum of 10 gev / c .",
    "the transparency grows at small @xmath57 due to vanishing inelastic @xmath109 cross section for a slow proton .",
    "as we see , the effects of ct are strongest at @xmath147 gev@xmath22 which corresponds to the scattering at @xmath140 .",
    "for the both considered nuclear targets , i.e. for @xmath148c and @xmath149au , the nuclear transparency rises by @xmath150 due to the ct effects .",
    "to summarize the main results of our calculations :    * for heavy targets in the case of resolved ( i.e. physical ) photon the nuclear transparency is expected to be a factor of @xmath151 smaller than in the case of unresolved ( i.e. bare ) photon .",
    "this effect is due to the absorption of the hadronic component of the physical photon , similar to the high - energy diffractive photoproduction @xcite . *",
    "the variation of the inelastic cross section of the outgoing meson - nucleon interaction by @xmath98 mb results in the change of the nuclear transparency by @xmath152 and , hence , can be observed experimentally . *",
    "the color transparency leads to the strong rise of the nuclear transparency with photon beam momentum at fixed @xmath8 , in contrast to the pure glauber model calculation .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that the studies of photon induced exclusive processes off nuclei in the kinematics available at tjnaf will provide new important insights into the interplay of soft and hard physics in two - body photon - induced reactions .",
    "moreover , such measurements would make it possible to compare the strengths of the interactions of various mesons with nucleons .",
    "these studies would also allow to use the photon - induced reactions as a precision tool for studying the short - range nuclear structure including short range correlations , non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , etc .",
