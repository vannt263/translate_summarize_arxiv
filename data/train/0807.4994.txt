    "to describe the qram algorithm , it is convenient to start from the analysis of its classical counterparts .    in the conventional ` fanout ' addressing scheme",
    ", the index register specifies the direction to follow to reach the memory cell we are interested in . in particular ,",
    "writing the index register in binary form , each bit of such register can be interpreted as the direction to take at a bifurcation of a binary tree .",
    "since the @xmath0 bits encode the directions to take at @xmath0 bifurcations , then @xmath1 different paths can be described this way .",
    "a realization of such indexing procedure is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : ram1 ] part a ) .",
    "we call it the ` fanout ' ram scheme , since each address bit fans out to control several switches placed on different nodes of the tree . in particular the @xmath4th bit of the index register acts as a controller for @xmath11 switches : if the bit has value 0 _ all _ the switches under its control will point `` up '' , otherwise they will all point `` down '' . by looking at fig .",
    "[ f : ram1 ] , it is easy to see that for every state of the index register only one out of the @xmath1 possible paths has all the switches in a `` conducting '' state : a signal will follow the path to the memory cell we are interested in .",
    "the main drawback of the fanout architecture is that it requires simultaneous control over all the @xmath12 nodes of the binary tree even though only @xmath0 nodes directly participate to the addressing of a given memory cell ( these are the switches which lie along the path to the addressed memory cell ) .",
    "fanout schemes are commonly implemented in ram chips  @xcite by translating them into electronic circuits where the switches of the binary tree are replaced by pairs of transistors  see fig .",
    "[ f : ram1]b ) .",
    "notice that the number of activated transistors can be reduced to @xmath9 with a more clever arrangement . in fig .",
    "[ f : ramcl2 ] we modify the fanout ram to attain a circuit where at each level of the binary tree only two transistors are activated , and where at the final stage only a single transistor is activated to open up the unique path to the desired memory slot . in total only @xmath13 transistors",
    "are activated for every memory call . however , it is important to note that the few last bits in the index register are connected ( in the last levels of the tree ) to an exponential number of transistors .",
    "hence , this architecture would not be more helpful in the implementation of a quantum ram than the conventional fanout architecture , as they both require the maintenance of quantum coherence over an exponential number of connections .",
    "= .8    = .8    an alternative addressing scheme  @xcite can be designed by changing the function of the @xmath14 switching elements in the binary tree .",
    "we name this procedure `` bucket - brigade '' since both the routing and the input - output signals are passed along the same route , like buckets of water passed along a line of improvised fire - fighters . in each node of the binary tree",
    "we place a three - state logic element ( a `` trit '' ) , which can store the values @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is a passive or ` wait ' state  see fig .",
    "[ f : bb]a ) .",
    "a trit in the state @xmath15 or @xmath16 acts as a switch that routes the signals transiting through its node `` up '' or `` down '' , respectively .",
    "a trit in the state @xmath17 does not propagate the signals transiting through its node , but changes its state to match the one of the arriving bit .",
    "initially all the trits are in the ` wait ' state @xmath17 . now each bit of the index register is sent into the binary tree , one at the time .",
    "when one of these bits encounters a trit in the state @xmath17 , its value is transferred to the trit , which enters one of the two switching states , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "a trit in the state @xmath17 that receives a @xmath15 , itself becomes @xmath15 , and routes all subsequent signals along the @xmath15 branch of its node of the binary tree .",
    "similarly , a trit in the state @xmath17 that receives a @xmath16 becomes @xmath16 , and routes all subsequent signals along the @xmath16 branch .",
    "after all the @xmath0 bits of the index register have been sent through the binary tree , a route has been carved through it : @xmath18 of the trits in the binary tree still have value @xmath17 , but any incoming signal will only encounter the @xmath0 trits with value @xmath15 or @xmath16 which will route it to the one destination ( out of the @xmath1 possible ones ) that was initially encoded in the index register .",
    "= .8      both the fanout scheme and the bucket - brigade scheme can be turned into quantum ram algorithms by transforming them into reversible processes and by requiring quantum coherence to be preserved . in abstract terms",
    "this is done by sending a quantum signal ( the _ quantum bus _ ) back and forth in the binary trees of fig .",
    "[ f : ram1 ] and [ f : bb ] , and by coupling it with the memory cell through c - not transformations .",
    "we will see that in the quantum version of the fanout ram , the @xmath4th index qubit is still required to control @xmath11 bifurcations in the binary switching tree , creating a fragile macroscopic superposition . while such high fanout control gates are relatively straightforward in a classical setting , they are rather costly in a quantum setting , where amplifying a signal makes it prone to decoherence .",
    "in particular , a qubit that interacts with @xmath11 quantum switches is highly likely to decohere as @xmath4 increases , even if its interaction with any given switch is small . in sec .",
    "[ s : optical ] we will present optical and solid state implementations of high fanout control gates . because of their exponential character such gates must inevitably succumb to problems of noise and decoherence as @xmath0 gets large .",
    "the gates of the fanout architecture must then introduce errors which scale as @xmath19 ( as the first gates in the bifurcation tree are responsible for an exponential number of paths , while the last gates in the bifurcation tree are coupled to an exponential number of paths ) . nonetheless for small @xmath0 ,",
    "useful fanout qrams might be implementable along the lines proposed .",
    "in addition , fanout qram designs are instructive as they allow us to identify failure mechanisms as @xmath0 gets large .    in contrast",
    ", the quantum version of the bucket - brigade addressing scheme does not suffer from this problem : even though the number of components of the device is @xmath10 , the number of control gates that needs to be performed in each memory call is only polynomial in @xmath20 . as a result , bucket - brigade qrams might be scalable to large sizes , even with relatively high switching error rates . if the error rate per switching event is @xmath21 , then the overall error rate per memory call is @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the bucket - brigade can operate also if its gates introduce errors which scale as @xmath23 , in contrast to the fanout architecture .",
    "for example , a per - switch error rate of @xmath24 allows one to address @xmath25 memory locations in quantum superposition with an overall error rate of @xmath26 , @xmath27 memory locations with an overall error rate of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 memory locations an overall error rate of @xmath30 . because of the exponential improvement of the bucket - brigade over fanout designs , a small change in the error rate can lead to a dramatic improvement in performance .",
    "a per - switch error rate of @xmath31 allows one to address @xmath32 memory locations in quantum superposition with an error rate of @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to employing the fanout or the bucket - brigade architectures , it is possible to use a combination of the two . in this case",
    ", there is a trade - off between the amount of coherent control and the number of quantum memory elements that are necessary .",
    "to quantize the fanout ram , we employ a quantum bus .",
    "this is a quantum system that can be routed coherently along every one of the @xmath1 possible paths of the binary tree and which is characterized by some internal degree of freedom that can be used to store and process information . at each bifurcation in the path",
    ", the choice of the route ( `` up '' or `` down '' ) is performed in a quantum - controlled fashion , i.e.  by using a unitary routing transformation controlled by the corresponding qubit in the index register . as in the conventional fanout ram , the @xmath4th index qubit in index register of a fanout qram controls @xmath11 bifurcations .",
    "the @xmath0 quantum controlled transformations along the binary tree convert the binary value of the index register q into the position of the bus system .",
    "this transformation is a binary - to - unary translation : the binary address stored in the index register is translated into the unary variable consisting of the position of the bus .",
    "the bus system then locally interacts with the memory cell placed at the exit of the path that it followed .",
    "if the index register q contains a superposition of addresses , then the bus system follows more than one path in superposition and locally interacts with all the memory cells relative to these paths .",
    "( more precisely , the position of the bus becomes entangled with the state of the index register . )",
    "this interaction coherently copies the content of the memory cell into the internal degree of freedom of the bus system . in the case",
    "in which the each memory cell of the database contains a single bit of information , the quantum bus is a single flying qubit and the copy operation is a single c - not gate . if , instead , each memory cell contains @xmath33 bits of information we can either use a single quantum bus with @xmath34 internal states , or we can transfer the information bit by bit with a single two - dimensional quantum bus by repeating the whole process @xmath33 times .    at this point , even though the desired information has been transferred to the bus , the user can not yet access it in quantum superposition , since the value of the q register is still correlated ( more precisely , entangled ) with the position of the bus system .",
    "since we want to preserve the quantum coherence , this correlation must first be removed .",
    "this can be achieved by `` uncomputing '' the binary - to - unary translation , i.e.  by running the translation backwards . in practice",
    ", this means that the bus system must be sent back along the quantum - controlled binary tree : at each bifurcation the controlled - unitary transformations decorrelate the value of the controlling qubit in the @xmath0 register from the bus system , which is thus routed back to the binary tree entrance .",
    "now , we just swap the state of the bus s internal degree of freedom to the output register a. the final result is that the uncomputation has decorrelated the bus system from the index register q , and the answer register a contains the state of the memory cell ( cells ) addressed by q. if q is initially in a superposition of address states , after the quantum memory call has been completed , q and a are in an entangled state , with each address in q perfectly correlated with the corresponding output in a.      to quantize the bucket - brigade procedure , in each node of the binary tree we place a three - level quantum system ( a `` qutrit '' )",
    ". if it is in the state @xmath35 or @xmath36 , then the qutrit acts as a quantum switch , routing the subsequent incoming qubits `` up '' or `` down '' , respectively . if , instead , the qutrit is in the state @xmath37 , then a unitary operation @xmath38 stores any incoming qubit by swapping the qubit s state into the state of the qutrit s first two levels .",
    "the qubits of the q register are sequentially sent through the apparatus : the state of the @xmath4th index qubit is stored in exactly one qutrit at the @xmath4th level of the tree and routes the subsequent qubits according to its state .",
    "after all the @xmath0 qubits of the q register have gone through the tree , @xmath0 quantum switches are active ( i.e. in a state @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) .    at this point , we send a bus qubit into the tree : it reaches the end of the tree where it meets with one of the @xmath1 memory cells ( when the index register in is a superposition of addresses , the bus qubit can meet more than one cell , in superposition ) . now the state of this memory cell is coherently copied into the bus .",
    "the uncomputation needed to decorrelate the position of the bus qubit can be easily performed by reflecting it back into the binary tree : the qutrit - switches route it back to the entrance of the tree .",
    "finally , the loading of the qutrits must be reversed .",
    "starting from the last level of the tree , the unitary @xmath39 is applied so that the qubits of the q register are recovered one by one and routed back to the entrance of the tree .",
    "after @xmath39 has been applied to all levels of the binary tree , the q register has been recovered and the qutrits in the tree have all been restored to the state @xmath37 . at the conclusion of the entire process , the q register is decorrelated from the binary tree and the bus qubit contains the value of the accessed memory cells .",
    "notice that , even though this procedure requires the existence of a total number of qutrits of the order of @xmath1 , only @xmath0 of them are active in any run of the protocol .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the qram schemes we have presented in the previous sections do not require the information contained in the addressed memory cells to be classical .",
    "indeed the whole architecture still works also in the case in which the information stored in the memory cells is purely quantum .",
    "of course in this case the no - cloning theorem  @xcite forbids us to `` copy '' the quantum data in the output register a : the protocol will simply delocalize the information originally contained in the addressed memory cell into an entangled configuration of the cells and a. in fact , the procedure that copies classical information , i.e.  the c - not gate , in general will entangle quantum information on which it acts . alternatively , a swap operation can be performed to transfer the quantum information to the bus .",
    "the bus can then transfer the quantum information out of the qram , at which point it can be sent to some desired destination .",
    "the type of quantum data processing that one implements on the memory states of the qram depends on the application one is interested in .",
    "notice that , in contrast to the case of classical memory cells , a qram procedure based on either the swap or the c - not transformations will generally leave the memory array entangled with the index and output registers q and a at the end of the procedure .    before proceeding we",
    "note also that it is possible to reduce the number of circuit elements in all the above implementations by using more clever geometric arrangements of the memory array .",
    "typically , a bidimensional array is used , and the index register is divided into two parts , one of which indexes a row in the memory array , the other a column . if rows and columns have the same size , we can reduce the number of necessary circuit elements to the square root of its original value , and still address the same number of memory cells .",
    "more complex arrangements ( such as using three - dimensional memory arrays ) would entail a further reduction of circuit elements , but are not typically used as they require much more complex wiring diagrams . with this in mind , in the rest of the paper we will concentrate on the case of one - dimensional memory arrays for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the basic concept of a qram dates to the early days of quantum computing , when researchers first began considering quantum computer architectures : a sketch of an optical fanout qram scheme can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in this section",
    "we construct detailed physical designs for qrams , taking into account the possibility of hybrid encodings where the quantum bus and the memory cells are implemented by different physical objects ( e.g. photons vs. trapped atoms ) . finally , we present an implementation of the bucket - brigade scheme .      an optical implementation of the fanout qram is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : polarizz ] . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the case in which the memory cells contain a single bit .",
    "= .8    here the value of index register q is encoded in a binary fashion in the internal state of @xmath20 atoms ( ions ) trapped into an optical lattice ( magneto - optical trap ) .",
    "the @xmath1 memory locations are addressed by translating this information on @xmath1 different spatial modes of the electromagnetic field of a ` bus ' photon characterized by polarizations @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we start with the register q prepared into the internal state of the @xmath0 atoms of the following form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the amplitude that the register q indicates the @xmath4th memory cell , and where @xmath42 denote the bits of @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath43 .",
    "we prepare a single photon in the polarized state @xmath44 and shine it onto the first atom : the coupling among them is such that the atom acts as a controller for the polarization of the photon ( see fig .  [",
    "f : cnot ] ) .",
    "then we send the bus photon through a polarizing beam splitter and rotate its polarization back to @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : polarizz ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the spatial mode occupied by the bus photon is now perfectly correlated with the value of the first index qubit , through a c - not transformation .",
    "we repeat the above procedure , using the second atom , i.e.  apply a c - not gate using the qubit @xmath45 as the control and the bus photon as the target .",
    "note that the c - not transformation must be crafted in such a way as to be independent of the position of the target photon , as the bus photon is now in two different spatial modes .",
    "this can be achieved by letting the two spatial modes interact with the gate at different times . now again",
    "we can split the bus photon s spatial mode using polarizing beam splitters and then reset its polarization using polarization rotators , as before .",
    "the value of the first two qubits @xmath46 and @xmath47 has been transferred to four spatial modes ( see fig .",
    "[ f : polarizz ] ) .",
    "we then iterate the procedure until the values of all the @xmath0 qubits of index register have been transferred to @xmath1 spatial modes of the bus photon .",
    "each of the @xmath1 spatial modes of the bus photon interacts with the first bit of the corresponding location in the memory array .",
    "the interaction is such that the bus photon s polarization is rotated if the memory bit is 1 .",
    "now we swap the state of the bus photon s polarization into the output register a , which was previously initialized in @xmath35 .",
    "since the polarization of the bus photon has been reset to @xmath35 , to invert the binary - to - unary encoding , it is sufficient to reflect the photon back through the whole setup  @xcite .",
    "= .5    notice that , even though the @xmath4th address bit fans out to @xmath11 controlled - controlled not gates , it only interacts with the bus qubit once : the number of physical interactions between information carrying degrees of freedom is exponentially smaller than the number of physical gates .",
    "this exponential - small paucity of interactions mirrors the classical case : in a classical fanout ram , even though the @xmath4th address bit interacts with two sets of @xmath11 transistors , the actual signal sent through the ram to address the memory interacts with only @xmath0 transistors .      in this section",
    "we present a fanout qram implementation where the addressing is realized by a collection of controlled phase gates .",
    "the main idea is to implement the binary tree as @xmath48 cavities in which ( at most ) one photon is present ( see fig .  [",
    "f : ssqram ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 qubits of the q register fan out to induce phase shifts in all the cavities .",
    "if these shifts are chosen appropriately , the incoming photon can resonate in only the cavity indexed by the register q. this can be achieved by using conditional phase shifters ( the solid squares of the picture ) controlled by the index register q. since there are @xmath1 possible cavities , we need to devise a scheme which is extremely sensitive to phase shifts : the width of the cavity resonance window must be of the order of @xmath49 , so that only one among cavities with similar phase shifts can be placed into resonance  @xcite .",
    "such routing scheme can be realized in principle both in an optical environment analogous to the one of sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumopt ] or in a solid state implementations  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "photolithographic techniques permit the etching of micrometer scale solid - state qubits , e.g. , superconducting charge or flux qubits , or electron spin quantum dots .",
    "these qubits can in turn be coupled to microwave cavities  @xcite . while existing systems couple only a few qubits to the cavity , because of the small scale of the qubits ( ranging from tens of nanometers for superconducting charge qubits or quantum dots to tens of micrometers for superconducting flux qubits ) compared with the relatively large scale of the cavity ( centimeters ) , in principle microwave cavities can be constructed so as to interact with a large number of such qubits simultaneously .",
    "the interaction of a single microwave photon with a large number of qubits can then be used to implement the large scale fanout required for a fanout qram . in this case",
    "the conditional phase shifters can be implemented , for example , following ref .",
    "@xcite and by requiring a single superconducting qubit which interacts with two microwave modes ( one encoding the quantum bus and one encoding the index register degree of freedom ) . in this case",
    "the required effective hamiltonian could be of the jaynes - cummings form .",
    "we need to operate the system far from resonance to ensure that the microwaves modes do not exchange excitations through this coupling  its only effect should be the insertion of a phase shift conditioned on the value of the qubit .",
    "= .9    once the routing has been performed the information is extracted from the memory cells by coupling each cell to one of the @xmath48 cavities . in the implementation discussed above , for instance , this can be achieved by placing in each of the memory cell locations two superconducting qubits that are employed both to store the information in the memory cell and to extract this information to an outgoing photon .",
    "( two qubits are needed in each cavity instead of one , in order to remove the feedback effect that the content of the memory cell would have on the cavity photon ) . if the cell stores a `` one '' , then the first superconducting qubit in the state @xmath36 and the second is in @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the first qubit induces a phase shift on the first outgoing photon , whereas the second qubit leaves the second outgoing photon untouched .",
    "if , instead , the cell stores a `` zero '' , then the states of the two superconducting qubits are reversed . with this procedure , the contents of the memory cell have been transferred to the two outgoing photons : the first is phase - shifted only if the memory contained a `` one '' , while the second is phase - shifted only if it contained a `` zero '' .    the circuit model of fig .",
    "[ f : ssqram ] can be used to construct a variety of designs for solid - state fanout qrams .",
    "a qram that is effectively the direct quantization of the classical fanout ram could be constructed using single electron transistors and coulomb blockade .",
    "for example , the index qubits could correspond to single electron transistors which , when activated , allow charge coherently to tunnel onto charge qubits , corresponding to the solid rectangles .",
    "these rectangles , when charged , in turn exert a coulomb blockade on their corresponding lines in the binary switching tree . the quantum bus is implemented by a single electron , which is routed via the coulomb blockade along the single unblocked branch of the tree . of course",
    ", the difficulties in performing all the coulomb blockade and tunneling steps in a coherent manner are formidable . because the logical qubits in this system are all registered by the presence or absence of electrons , charge noise is likely to decohere the charge fanout qram very rapidly . in the cavity solid state qram described in detail above , by contrast",
    ", coherence times are set by the coherence scale of the optical cavities used to perform the fanout and addressing .",
    "such coherence times can be relatively long compared with charge qubit coherence times ( microseconds compared with nanoseconds ) .",
    "in this section we give a possible implementation of the quantum bucket - brigade scheme where the index register qubits are encoded into photons propagating along a network of coupled cavities that contain trapped atoms .",
    "the main idea is the following . in each node of the binary tree , the qutrit is implemented by an atom with the level structure given in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : bb11 ] . the levels @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coupled to the `` up '' spatial paths in the tree ( i.e.  the dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "f : bb11 ] ) , while the levels @xmath52 and @xmath53 are coupled to the `` down '' spatial paths ( i.e.  the dotted lines ) .",
    "start the protocol by preparing all atoms in the level @xmath37 and sending in a photon which encodes into its polarization state the first qubit of the q register ( alternatively one can replace polarization encoding with time - bin encoding ) . by turning on a strong laser field to induce a raman transition",
    ", the photon will be absorbed and stored in the first atom in the @xmath50 atomic level if it is in the state @xmath35 , and in the @xmath52 level if it is in @xmath36 .",
    "now send the second photon which encodes the second qubit of q : it will meet the atom in the state @xmath50 or @xmath52 depending on the value of the first qubit .",
    "again we use raman transition technique to absorb ( and subsequently re - emit ) the photon in the @xmath51 level or in the @xmath53 level respectively . in the first case ( since @xmath51 and @xmath50 couple only to the `` up '' spatial path that connects to the subsequent level in the tree ) , the second qubit will move in the `` up '' path to the uppermost atom in the second node . here",
    "it will be absorbed by the @xmath50 or @xmath52 level of the second atom , depending on its value . in the second case , instead",
    ", the qubit follows an identical evolution , but on the `` down '' path , reaching the lowermost atom in the second node .",
    "now the third qubit of q is sent .",
    "it will follow a path along the first two bifurcations that is determined by the values of the first two qubits , and it will be absorbed in the @xmath50 or @xmath52 level of one of the atoms of the third node , thus determining the path that the fourth qubit will follow , and so on .",
    "after all the qubits of the q register have been stored in the respective nodes , a bus qubit initially in the state @xmath35 is sent through the apparatus .",
    "thanks to the presence of the other qubits stored in the respective atoms , it will be directed to the memory cell that is addressed by the q register , where the cell s value will be copied onto it .",
    "now this bus qubit can follow the binary tree backwards , exiting with the memory cell s value . to conclude the protocol , all the atoms are made to emit their stored qubits backwards with sequenced raman transitions , starting from the last node and progressing to the first .",
    "the end result is that the memory cell s content has been stored on the bus qubit , while all the qubits of the q register have been re - emitted and are again available .",
    "because the bucket - brigade qram operates by sequential coupling of qutrits , it takes @xmath54 steps to retrieve one of @xmath1 memories coherently . in the discussed implementation",
    "the nodes of the binary tree are atoms coupled via photons through raman pulses",
    ". alternatively they could be solid - state artificial atoms such as superconducting qubits or electron spin quantum dots , for which a variety of tunable coupling schemes that allow the desired interactions have been designed @xcite .",
    "all such schemes will introduce errors , both via inaccuracies in the application of the classical fields required to induce interactions between qutrits , and via interaction with the environment .",
    "a key requirement is that the probability of passive states @xmath37 being inadvertently excited to active states @xmath55 be small enough that signals are not routed along the wrong path .",
    "essentially , as long as the error rate is significantly less than one over the number of steps required in a memory call ( i.e. @xmath54 ) then the coherent memory call goes through with high probability .",
    "another way to think of the resilience of the qram in the face of noise and error is the following .",
    "if the memory address register is initially in a superposition of a large number , e.g. , all , of the memory sites , then all pieces of the qram circuit will be used during the coherent memory call . because the bucket - brigade scheme for calling a single memory involves only @xmath0 qutrits , however , _ in each component of the superposition _ only @xmath0 qutrits will be active",
    ". such superpositions are typically highly robust in the face of noise and loss @xcite .",
    "random access memory forms an integral part of computers and data processing protocols , whether classical or quantum .",
    "this paper showed how quantum random access memories ( qrams ) might be implemented by using quantum optical and solid - state quantum information processing techniques .",
    "we proposed a new paradigm for constructing both classical and quantum rams , the bucket - brigade paradigm , in which the degree of fanout required to perform a memory call can be reduced exponentially , from @xmath10 to @xmath9 . as a result , the memory - addressing portion of classical rams might be made more energy efficient , and large quantum rams might be constructed without recourse to expensive and difficult quantum error correction techniques .",
    "such large - scale qrams could prove useful for fast pattern recognition algorithms and for communication and computation protocols in which one party wishes to access and process information without the provider of the information knowing who accessed the information or even what the information was .",

    "<S> is a highly versatile device for storing and accessing information . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of an array of memory cells where information is stored in the form of bits . </S>",
    "<S> each cell is associated to a unique address , i.e.  a number which identifies the location of the cell . </S>",
    "<S> the main characteristic of a ram is that each memory cell can be separately addressed at will , whence the designation ` random access ' . </S>",
    "<S> to access a cell , its address must be provided in an input register ( the _ index register _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the device will then output the content of the memory cell in a second register ( the _ output register _ )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the input register is composed by @xmath0 bits , the ram is capable of addressing @xmath1 different memory locations : when given an @xmath0-bit address @xmath4 , the ram returns the bit string @xmath5 which was stored in the memory slot of the database labeled by @xmath4 .    </S>",

    "<S> we show that there exists a routing algorithm , the `` bucket - brigade '' introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which requires only a small number ( @xmath3 ) of two - qubit interaction to implement a memory call . even though the number of logic gates in the system is necessarily is exponential , only @xmath3 of those gates need be activated in the course of a qram memory call . </S>",
    "<S> a classical ram that uses the bucket - brigade addressing schemes need only activate @xmath9 transistors in the course of a memory call , in contrast with a conventional ram that activates @xmath10 transistors . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a ram that uses our design might operate with less dissipation and power consumption than a conventional ram . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that energy costs in the memory addressing are not sufficiently high in current ram chips to justify an immediate adoption of the bucket - brigade . </S>",
    "<S> other sources of inefficiencies and dissipations are currently predominant ( mostly in the memory cells themselves ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , new promising memory cell technologies are being developed ( e.g.  the `` memristor '' cells  @xcite ) , which would drastically cut back cell dissipation , so that cutting back dissipation in the addressing may become important in the future . in the quantum regime , the addressing scheme might allow the construction of a relatively large quantum ram without the need for costly quantum error correction .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper follows . </S>",
    "<S> we start by analyzing the two different ram architectures : the conventional ( fanout ) architecture  @xcite and the bucket - brigade architecture  @xcite . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> the control lines that route the signals to the destination memory cell are replaced by memory elements that control the routing . </S>",
    "<S> the result is an exponential decrease in the number of two - body interactions required to implement the routing and to address memory . </S>",
    "<S> both these architectures can be used in the quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the paper by giving some physical implementations of both qram schemes . </S>"
