    "ferroelectric transitions have been attracting much attention in various systems .",
    "it is known that they can occur even in simple particle systems . for example , one - component spherical particles with a point dipole undergo a ferroelectric transition in crystal or liquid - crystal phases if the dipole interaction is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "such spherical dipoles form various noncubic crystals in ferroelectric phases @xcite .",
    "ferroelectriciity was also studied in positionally disordered dipolar solids@xcite .",
    "recently , johnson _",
    "et al._@xcite have investigated a ferroelectric transition of spheroidal particles with a dipole moment @xmath4 parallel to the spheroidal axis .",
    "they found that the static dielectric constant increases up to @xmath5 with increasing @xmath4 if the aspect ratio is close to unity . in this paper",
    ", we examine ferroelectric transitions in mixtures of slightly spheroidal dipoles and spherical impurities .    in many solids ,",
    "the polarization is induced by ion displacements within unit cells and the dielectric constant is very large . as a unique aspect ,",
    "the ferroelectric transitions become _ diffuse _ with a sufficient amount of disorder@xcite , which take place over a wide temperature range without long - range dipolar order .",
    "notable examples are relaxors @xcite such as pb(mg@xmath6nb@xmath7)o@xmath8 ( pmn ) , where the random distribution of mg@xmath9 and nb@xmath10 at b sites yields quenched random fields at pb@xmath9 sites @xcite . in relaxors ,",
    "temperature - dependence of the optic index of refraction suggested appearance of mesoscopic polarization heterogeneities @xcite , called polar nanoregions ( pnrs ) .",
    "they are enhanced at relatively high @xmath2 as near - critical fluctuations and are frozen at lower @xmath2 .",
    "it is widely believed that these pnrs give rise to a broad peak in the dielectric permittivity @xmath11 as a function of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "they have been detected by neutron and x - ray scattering @xcite and visualized by transmission electron microscopy @xcite and piezoresponse force microscopy @xcite .",
    "strong correlations have also been found between the pnrs and the compositional heterogeneity of the b site cations @xcite .",
    "relaxor behaviors also appear in other disordered dipolar systems@xcite .",
    "in particular , orientational glass has long been studied in mixed crystals such as kcn@xmath0kbr@xmath1 or k@xmath0li@xmath1tao@xmath8 @xcite , where the two mixed components have similar sizes and shapes . upon cooling below melting , they first form a cubic crystal without long - range orientational order in the _ plastic crystal _ phase . at lower @xmath2 ,",
    "an orientational phase transition occurs , where the crystal structure becomes noncubic . in nondilute mixtures , this transition is diffuse with slow relaxations , where the orientations and the strains are strongly coupled , both exhibiting nanoscale heterogeneities@xcite",
    ". some polymers also undergo ferroelectric transitions due to alignment of permanent dipoles @xcite .",
    "in particular , poly(vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene ) copolymers@xcite exhibited large electrostriction and relaxor - like polarization responses after electron irradiation ( which brings disorder in polymer crystals ) .",
    "we also mention strain glass in shape - memory alloys @xcite , where the dipolar interaction does not come into play but a diffuse ferroelastic transition occurs with strain heterogeneities .",
    "we now recognize the universal features of glass coupled with a phase transition , where the order parameter fluctuations are frozen at low @xmath2 .    in their molecular dynamics simulation of relaxors ,",
    "et al_.@xcite started with a first - principles hamiltonian for atomic displacements in perovskite - type crystals .",
    "as a compositional distribution , they assumed nanoscale chemically ordered regions embedded in a chemically disordered matrix . on the other hand",
    ", we investigate general aspects of ferroelectric glass with a simple molecular model . in electrostatics",
    ", we use an ewald scheme including image dipoles and applied electric field @xcite , which has been used to study water between electrodes@xcite . to prepare a mixed crystal , we cool a liquid mixture from high @xmath2 ; then , our impurity distribution at low @xmath2 is naturally formed during crystallization @xcite .",
    "our system consists of spheroidal dipoles and spherical apolar particles only . nevertheless , we can realize enhanced polarization fluctuations forming pnrs and calculate the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "we can also calculate the responses to applied electric field and to zfc@xmath3fc ( zero - field - cooling and field - cooling ) temperature changes . in the latter ,",
    "nonergodicity of glass is demonstrated , so its experiments have been performed in spin glass@xcite , relaxors@xcite , orientational glass@xcite , relaxor - like polymers @xcite , and strain glass@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will explain our theoretical scheme and numerical method . in sec .",
    "iii , we will explain a structural phase transition in a one - component system of dipolar spheroids . in sec .",
    "iv , we will examine diffuse ferroelectric transitions with impurities .",
    "furthermore , we will examine responses to cyclic applied field in sec.v and to cyclic temperature changes in sec.vi .",
    "additionally , antiferroelectric glass will be briefly discussed in sec.vii .",
    "we treat mixed crystals composed of spheroidal polar particles as the first species and spherical apolar particles ( called impurities ) as the second species .",
