    "feii  multiplet emission is a prominent feature in the ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical spectra of most active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , including qsos at redshifts as high as @xmath7 ( e.g. , freudling et al .",
    "2003 , barth et al .",
    "2003 , iwamuro et al .",
    "2004 , jiang et al .",
    "2007 , kurk et al . 2007 ) .",
    "its equivalent width ( ew ) varies significantly from object to object ( e.g. , from @xmath8   to undetectable for the emission in the 44344684  region [ hereafter @xmath9 ; boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "feii  is an important probe of agn physics .",
    "for example , bg92 showed that the relative strength of the feii  @xmath10 emission is a dominating variable in the first principal component ( pc1 ) in their analysis of the correlation matrix of qso properties which is generally believed to be linked to certain fundamental parameter of accretion process ( e.g. , the relative accretion rate , often expressed as @xmath11 or @xmath12 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2000 , boroson 2002 ) .",
    "more importantly , feii  emission relative to that of @xmath13-elements ( e.g. mgii ) can be considered to be an observational proxy of the fe/@xmath13 abundance ratio . if iron is mainly produced by type 1a supernovae that have long - lived progenitors , this ratio would have a characteristic delay of @xmath14 1 gyr from the initial starburst in the quasar host environment , based on chemical evolution models .",
    "thus feii  emission in principle can serve as a cosmic clock to constrain the age of qsos and the epoch of the first star formation of their host galaxies ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; and cf . ,",
    "e.g. , matteucci & recchi 2001 ) .    however , the ionization and excitation mechanisms of the feii  emission are very complex due to the low ionization potential of fe@xmath15 atom ( 7.9ev ) , the low energy levels of various excited sates of fe@xmath16 ion , and particularly the complexity of its atomic structure ( see baldwin et al .",
    "2004 , collin & joly 2000 and references therein , joly et al .",
    "thus the conversion from feii  emission to iron abundance is not straightforward ( e.g. verner et al .",
    "2004 , baldwin et al .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that feii  emission of agns arises from a number of different sites with similarly suitable excitation conditions , including gaseous clouds gravitationally bound in the narrow - line and broad - line region ( nlr and blr ) , ( the base of ) outflows , and the surface of the accretion disk ( ad ) [ see , e.g. , collin - souffrin 1987 et seq . ,",
    "murray & chiang 1997 , matsuoka et al .",
    "2007 , zhang et al . 2007 ] .",
    "this has already been hinted by the reverberation observations of feii  emission , particularly of its optical component , since the cross - correlation function appears to be flat - topped ( vestergarrd & peterson 2005 , kuehn et al .",
    "2008 ; see also kollatschny & welsh 2001 , wang et al . 2005 ) . therefore , to use of feii  emission as a proxy of fe abundance and further as a cosmic clock requires a better understanding of its emission mechanism .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the feii / mgii  ratios of qsos at the same redshift have a rather large scatter ( e.g. iwamuro et al .",
    "2004 , leighly & moore 2006 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the excitation mechanisms and sites of feii  emission are well governed by certain fundamental parameters ( such as eddington ratio ) ) is the ratio between the bolometric and eddington luminosities .",
    "eddington luminosity ( @xmath17 ) , by definition , is the luminosity at which the gravity of the central source acting on an electron ",
    "proton pair ( i.e. fully ionized gas ) is balanced by the radiation pressure due to electron thomson scattering ; @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23are the gravitational constant , speed of light , mass of the central source , proton mass , thomson scattering cross - section , respectively . in accretion - powered radiation systems , @xmath2",
    "is often referred to as _ dimensionless accretion rate @xmath24 _ ( the relative accretion rate normalized by eddington accretion rate @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 being mass accretion rate and @xmath28 the accretion efficiency ) as @xmath24 is not an observable ; yet the two notations are different both in meaning and in scope of application . even in the accretion - powered radiation systems like agns ,",
    "@xmath2  ( @xmath0 ) is not equivalent to @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) except in the simple thin accretion disk model of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "therefore , we call @xmath2__dimensionless luminosity _ _ ( @xmath29 ) . for clarification or for the ease of notation ,",
    "below we use @xmath2  and @xmath29 alternately . ] due to certain self - regulation mechanisms that maintain the normal dynamically quasi - steady ( or even quasi - virialized ) states of the gas surrounding the central engine of agns .",
    "it is well - known for decades that qso spectra are remarkably similar , at the zeroth - order approximation , with emission lines of similar intensity ratios sitting atop a blue continuum regardless of their luminosities and redshifts ( davidson & netzer 1979 , korista 1999 , dong et al .",
    "2008 ; see more evidence and insightful arguments for the similarity in gaskell et al .",

    "2007 , gaskell & benker 2008 ) .  in the range of @xmath30 @xmath31and @xmath2  in the range of @xmath32 .",
    "] this similarity means that the integrated spectra and global properties of qsos are rather insensitive to the detailed distributions of various gas properties and the ` microscopic ' physical processes taking placing in the line - emitting region of agns ; instead , they are governed by the powerful selection mechanisms introduced by the atomic physics ( albeit not exactly identified yet ) , as proposed by baldwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in the `` locally optimally - emitting clouds '' model that has reproduced the overall qso broad - line spectra ( e.g. korista & goad 2000 ) .",
    "if the variations of the emission lines , particularly , the narrow - line or broad - line feii  emissions , are in a similar situation  i.e. , their variations are indeed governed by certain self - regulation mechanisms and thus are regular , we may calibrate the translation from feii  emission to abundance and constrain chemical evolution in the quasar environment .    motivated by these considerations , we carry out a systematic study on the strengths of uv and optical feii  emissions , by taking advantage of the unprecedented spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "particularly , using the analysis of vron - cetty et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we are able to study narrow - line feii  emission systematically for the first time . the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the selection criteria of the sample , the spectral processing , and correlation and regression analyses .",
    "section 3 presents the results and our discussions .",
    "section 4 is our brief conclusions and implications . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath33=70 kms@xmath34mpc@xmath34 , @xmath35=0.3 and @xmath36=0.7 .",
    "we first construct a homogenous sample of seyfert 1s and qsos ( namely type-1 agns ) from the spectral data set of the sdss fourth data release ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) , according to the following criteria : ( 1 ) redshift @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) the median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath37 per pixel in the optical feii  and h@xmath38  region ( 44005400 ) ; ( 3 ) the rest - frame absorption - line equivalent widths ( ews ) of cak ( 3934 ) , cak + h@xmath39 ( 3970 ) and h@xmath40 ( 4102 ) @xmath41 .",
    "the redshift cut is set to ensure the h@xmath38  and feii  @xmath42 multiplets are present in the sdss spectra ; the s / n criterion allows proper placement of local continua and the accurate measurement of emission lines ( especially broad - line and narrow - line feii  emissions ) ; the third criterion ensures the measurement of the agn luminosity and the emission - line ews suffering little from the contamination of the host - galaxy starlight . by combining sdss spectra of high - luminosity qsos and absorption - line or star - forming galaxies",
    "we find that our selection criteria corresponds to a galaxy contribution @xmath43% around 5100 .    after removing duplications and sources with large number of bad pixels in the h@xmath38  and",
    "feii  @xmath42 region , our final sample consists of 4178 type-1 agns ( hereafter the full type 1 sample ) . of them , 2092 have redshift @xmath44 and median s / n @xmath45 per pixel in the uv feii  region ( 22003090 ) , which are used to examine the behavior of uv feiiand mgii  @xmath46 doublet lines ( hereafter @xmath4 ) , and referred to as the uv subsample .",

    "every broad feii  lines are assumed to have the same profile as broad h@xmath38while the redshift of broad - line feii  is set to be a free parameter ; the uncertainty of the feii  line width has little effect on the measurement of the feii  flux ( salvainder et al .",
    "2007 , hu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "all narrow emission lines are fitted with a single gaussian except the [ oiii ]  @xmath474959,5007 doublet ; each line of the [ oiii ]  doublet is modeled with two gaussians , with one accounting for the line core and the other for a possible blue wing as seen in many objects .",
    "the redshift and width of narrow - line feii  are set to be free parameters .",
    "here we must note that , to properly measure the parameters of feii  emission , the separation of narrow - line feii  from the broad - line one is very important ; as far as we know , this point has been long neglected mainly because of the lack of a narrow - line feii  template until vron - cetty et al .",
    "narrow feii  multiplets , both permitted and forbidden , have been observed in the agn spectra , both in the uv ( e.g. , vestergaard & wilkes 2001 , wang et al .",

    "two striking features emerge as follows :    * according to the spearman correlation analysis , the strongest correlations of almost all the emission - line intensity ratios and ews are with @xmath2 , rather than with @xmath0 or @xmath1  itself .. this is because a significant fraction of broad h@xmath38  is emitted from the surface of the ad ( and/or high - ionization , optically - thin clouds ) .",
    "we will discuss this point and other properties of broad h@xmath38 in a forthcoming paper ( see also  3.3 ) . note that hydrogen balmer lines , which can be produced through both the recombination process of h@xmath59 ion and the collisional - excitation of h@xmath15 atom , originates efficiently from both the fully ionized h@xmath59 region and the partially ionized hi@xmath60 region ; thus the total emission of balmer lines is hybrid , as suggested by mounting observational facts ( see marziani et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ;  4.2 of wang et al . [ 2009 ] ) . ]",
    "this is confirmed by the spearman partial correlation analysis : when controlling for linewidth , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , there are still strong correlations with @xmath2 , but _ not _ _ vice versa_. besides , generally line ratios have tighter correlations with @xmath2  than the ews of the related emission lines .",
    "* the intensity ratios of feii  emissions  both narrow and broad , both in the uv and in the optical  to mgii  @xmath61 have very strong , positive correlations with @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , ( narrow feii)/mgii  has a stronger correlation with @xmath2  than ( broad feii)/mgii ( @xmath56= 0.74 versus 0.58 and 0.46 ) .    in figure 4 , we plot the equivalent widths of the ultraviolet ( @xmath62 ) , optical ( @xmath63 ) broad - line and narrow - line feii  emissions versus @xmath64(5100 ) , black hole mass , and eddington ratio ( @xmath65 ) . in figure 5 ,",
    "the three correlations of feii / mgii  ratios with @xmath2are illustrated ; these tight correlations are striking considering the narrow range of @xmath2  in our sample ( @xmath66 for a log - normal distribution ) and the known systematical errors in the @xmath2  estimation ( see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "we performed linear regressions in the log  log scale using the method of kelly ( 2007 ) .",
    "this method adopts a bayesian approach and accounts for measurement errors , censoring and intrinsic scatter .",
    "the results are as follows , @xmath67 the intrinsic standard deviation of these relations ( corrected for measurement errors ) are 0.04 , 0.22 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "as shown above , a general trend is that the emission - line ews and intensity ratios correlate more tightly with @xmath2  than with @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we focus on the behaviors of the narrow - line and broad - line feii  emissions , and defer the comprehensive discussions to an accompanying paper ( dong et al . , 2009b ) .",
    "first , it is quite unexpected that narrow - line feiihas a tighter correlation with @xmath2  than broad - line feii , as the gas emitting broad - line feii  is thought to be closer to and thus should be linked more tightly to the central engine than the narrow - line .",
    "one possible explanation is that the origin of narrow - line feii  is more homogeneous than the broad - line ( see  3.2 and 3.3 ) .",
    "second , the line ratios have stronger correlations with @xmath2than the ews of narrow and broad feii .",
    "this is natural since , compared to line ratio , ew depends on more additional parameters such as the covering factor of the blr and the anisotropy of the continuum radiation .",
    "the exceptions ( see table 1 ) are the correlations between line ratios and @xmath2that have a flat log  log slope , such as ( narrow feii)/(broad feii ) ; the dynamical range of the line ratio is small and the relation is dominated by fluctuation caused by the measurement errors .",
    "third , uv feii  has not as tight a correlation with @xmath2as the optical feii .",
    "this is caused by certain radiation transfer effects that we will discussed in dong et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "fourth and probably the most important , as we mentioned in  2.2 , in any case the ratios of feii  to mgii  have quite tight correlations with @xmath2 , and yet not with @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "collin et al . ( 2006 ) argued that the use of fwhm would introduce systematic biases to the virial @xmath1  estimate due to viewing angle effect and the presence of non - virialized velocity component(s ) ( see also sulentic et al .",

    "we thus calculate @xmath1  also using the relation proposed by collin et al .",
    "( 2006 , their eqn . 7 ) and others ; this alternative @xmath1  estimate leads to similar results .",
    "we note that , in the plot of ( narrow feii)/mgii  versus @xmath2(panel c of figure 4 ) , there are some data points at the low @xmath2  end ( @xmath68 ) with systematically larger line ratios .",
    "this is likely caused by the over - estimated @xmath1  due to the systematic biases as suggested by those authors , which is confirmed by the correlation of the offset with fwhm ( @xmath69 for the 1492 objects with reliably detected narrow feii ) .",
    "all the outliers with offsets of @xmath70 dex upward have fwhm @xmath71 @xmath48(with the mean and standard deviation of 9200 and 2200 @xmath48 ) . for such large fwhms ,",
    "even collin et al.s correction might be inadequate ( in fact , collin et al.s correction is by a factor of only 0.5 compared to the estimates of the vestergaard & peterson formalism ) .",
    "we will address this issue using a well - calibrated @xmath1  formalism with mgii  fwhm in wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "a strong , negative correlation between ew and @xmath2has been noted by several authors for civ  @xmath72 line ( baskin & laor 2004 ; see also bachev et al .",
    "both groups suggested that @xmath2  is the fundamental driver of the baldwin effect ( beff )  a well - known anticorrelation between the emission - line ews and the agn luminosity ( baldwin 1977 ) , although they then did not know the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "the findings in this paper expand this picture .",
    "although the gas environment in the line - emitting region of agns is complex and chaotic , the strength of almost all emission lines are governed by @xmath2 .",
    "it is well - known that civ  is a high - ionization line ; mgii , low - ionization and optically thick ; and feii , low - ionization and optically thin ( e.g. , collin - souffrin et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the emerging pattern is that , as @xmath2  increases , the emission strength of high - ionization _ or _ optically thick lines decreases whereas the strength of low - ionization _ and _ optically thin lines increases .",
    "high - ionization lines are emitted from the illuminated surface of the clouds ; optically thick lines , either from the illuminated surface ( e.g. recombination line ly@xmath13 ) or from the thin transition layer located immediately behind the hydrogen ionization front ( e.g. , with the optical depth at the lyman limit being in the range of 10 and 10@xmath73 for low - ionization mgii ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1986 ) ; yet low - ionization , optically thin lines such as feii  multiplets arise from the partially ionized hi@xmath60 region ( i.e. , from the ionization - bounded clouds only ) .",
    "hence , the correlation pattern may be telling us that , as @xmath2  increases , the column density ( @xmath74 ) of the clouds in the line - emitting region increases .",
    "we argue that the underlying physics is certain self - regulation mechanisms caused by ( or corresponding to ) eddington ratio ( dimensionless luminosity , not dimensionless accretion rate ) .",
    "is linked tightly to @xmath24 anyway ( cf .",
    "footnote 1 ; merloni & heinz 2008 ) .",
    "thus there is an additional effect associated with @xmath29 yet directly via @xmath24 as follows .",
    "the increase in @xmath29 means , meanwhile , the increase in @xmath24 , the gas supply .",
    "reasonably , it is from the supplied gas spiraling into the central engine that ( at least a significant part of ) the line - emitting clouds originate ; this is particularly true for the blr and inner nlr clouds that are located between the torus ( as the fuel reservoir ) and the accretion disk ( e.g. gaskell & goosman 2008 ) .",
    "hence , as @xmath29 increases , the total mass of line - emitting gas increases . ]",
    "these mechanisms maintain the normal dynamically quasi - steady ( or even quasi - virialized ) states of the gas surrounding the central engine of agns ; i.e. , they regulate the global distributions of the properties of the clouds gravitationally bound in the line - emitting region ( including the inner nlr , see  3.2 ) .",
    "the details are beyond the scope of this paper , and are deferred to dong et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "essentially , _ there is a lower limit on the column density of clouds bound to the agn line - emitting region , which is set by @xmath2_. even at @xmath75 , low-@xmath74  clouds are blown away because they are not massive enough to balance the radiation pressure force that is boosted by photoelectric absorption ( see , e.g. , fabian et al .",

    "no feii  emission is detected at @xmath84 significance _ in any object in the sample_. thus , according to the well - established unification scheme for seyfert galaxies ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , we conclude that _ narrow - line feiioriginates purely from the gas bound in the inner nlr that locates closer to the central engine than the torus_. the inner edge of the dusty torus is known to be on scales of parsecs , roughly the dust sublimation radius ; its extent is likely on scales of several tens of parsecs ( e.g. , schmitt et al .",

    "2004 , zhang et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "in contrast to the narrow - line feii , the ews of the broad - line feii  emissions show at most a moderate correlation with @xmath2 . what caused the different behavior ?",
    "a natural explanation is that broad feii  does not originate from a unique site , i.e. , not only from the clouds bound in the blr .",
    "an additional site is plausibly the surface of the ad , which has been speculated and argued for a long time ( e.g. collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1980 , murray & chiang 1997 , zhang et al . 2006 ) . the ad surface at radii of typically hundreds of @xmath85(@xmath86 )",
    "is argued to be an ideal site to emit low - ionization lines such as balmer lines , mgii  @xmath4 and the uv and optical feii(e.g .",
    "collin - souffrin 1987 et seq . ) .",
    "this is convincingly supported by the observations of low - ionization lines of double - peaked profile in a minority of agns ( balmer lines : e.g. chen et al .",
    "1989 , eracleous & halpern 2003 , strateva et al .",
    "2003 ; mgii : e.g. halpern et al . 1996 ) , particularly by the discoveries of balmer lines having , in addition to a symmetric broad component located at the system redshift , an separate , extremely broad double - peaked component that is apparently gravitationally redshifted ( chen et al . 1989 , wang et al . 2005 ; see a treatment for the general case of twisted , warped disk in wu et al .",
    "this disk component constitutes partly the often - called `` red shelf '' or `` very broad component '' ( see , e.g. , sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ) of the balmer - line profile .",
    "in fact , double - peaked feii  emission lines are observed in some disk - accreting systems such as cataclysmic variable stars , together with other double - peaked low - ionization lines such as balmer lines , caii , siii  and hei  lines that arise definitely from the ad according to doppler tomography ( e.g. roelofs et al .",
    "2006 , smith et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "note that the ad radii that can emit low - ionization lines are less than the critical radius of the gravitationally unstable part of the ad , @xmath87 ( collin & hur 2001 ) .",
    "it is argued that _ the gravitationally unstable disk is one source of the clouds bound in the line - emitting region of agns , particularly for low - ionization lines such as mgii  and both narrow and broad feiias suggested in this paper _",
    "( collin & hur 2001 ; see also leighly 2004 ) ; other sources of the clouds can be outflows that are liable to fragmentation ( proga et al . 2008 ) and gas infalling from the torus ( gaskell & goosmann 2008 ) . compared to the gas in the torus , these clouds have less or even no dust .    finally , we must mention that , in such high - density and high - column density clouds , some researchers have argued that photoionization heating might not be sufficient , additional heating like a mechanical one seems be necessary to strengthen the hi@xmath88 region ( e.g. , vron - cetty et al . 2006 , joly et al .",
    "there is evidence that mechanical heating from outflows may be such a source ( s .- h.zhang , in preparation ) , although its contribution is generally expected not to be very significant and hard to estimate observationally .",
    "outflows , which are launched from the ad  dependent on @xmath2  in a certain way , can have large inclination angles or even equatorial ( murray et al .",
    "1995 , proga et al .",
    "2008 ) , and thus collide with clouds in the line - emitting region or even in the torus .",
    "the collisions would also increase clouds in the blr and inner nlr .",
    "in this paper , we find that the narrow - line feii  originates purely from the inner nlr on scales less than the torus . yet ,",
    "the sites of the broad - line feiiare likely to be not unique : similar to the situation of broad h@xmath38  ( probably to a less degree ) , a significant fraction of the emission is from the surface of the accretion disk instead of the clouds bound in the blr . in summary , feii  emission will arise from any gas surrounding the central engine of agns that has sufficiently high density , column density and heating energy input , and at the same time has very low dust content .",
    "more importantly , although the excitation mechanisms of feii  emission ( and the sites for the broad - line one ) are complex , its relative strengths with respect to both the continuum and other emission lines ( particularly mgii ) correlate tightly and positively with @xmath2 , and intrinsically _ not _ with agn luminosity or @xmath1 .",
    "that is , in addition to the global similarity ( to the 0th - order approximation ) of the qso spectra , the 1st - order variation of the emission lines are controlled by @xmath2 .",
    "the essential underlying physical mechanism of these correlations is that eddington ratio ( dimensionless luminosity , @xmath89 , see footnote 1 ) regulates the distribution of the column density of the clouds bound in the line - emitting region .",
    "we will discuss it further in an accompanying paper , including its implication to the beff and its second - order effects ( dong et al .",
    "one possible interesting implication is that , as far as spectral correlations in the uv  optical band are concerned ( particularly the feii   [ oiii ]  anticorrelation ) , bg92 s pc1 could share the same origin  @xmath2   with pc2 , which is exactly the beff of heii  @xmath824686 line ( bg92 , wills et al .",
    "1999 ; see dietrich et al .",
    "2002 for an investigation of the heii  beff ) .",
    "if the observed large scatter of feii / mgii  at the same redshift is caused predominately by the diversity of @xmath2 , then it is hopeful to still use feii / mgii  as a measure of the fe / mg abundance ratio to study the chemical evolutionary history of the gas surrounding agns and to constrain its age ( `` cosmic clock '' ) , once the systematic variation caused by @xmath2  is corrected according to the formalisms ( eqn .",
