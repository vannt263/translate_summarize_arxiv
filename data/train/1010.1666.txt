    "there are several ways to approximate a fractional brownian motion .",
    "one of the first approximations was given by taqqu @xcite in terms of stationary gaussian sequences .",

    "sottinen constructed a simple approximation of a fractional brownian motion on an interval for @xmath15 by sums of square - integrable random variables in @xcite .",
    "he used the wiener integral representation of a fractional brownian motion on an interval , @xmath16 , for a suitable deterministic kernel @xmath17 , due to molchan and golosov , and norros _ et al .",

    ", he combined a pointwise approximation of the kernel @xmath18 with donsker s theorem .",
    "this approach was extended by nieminen @xcite to weak convergence of perturbed martingale differences to fractional brownian motion .",
    "we shall utilize sottinen s approximation with binary random variables throughout this paper .",
    "the main problem of applying the wick product on random variables with continuous distributions is that it is not a pointwise operation .",
    "thus , an explicit computation of the wick ",
    "it integral is only possible in rare special cases .",
    "but this is precisely the advantage of the binary random walks .",
    "in such a purely discrete setup , we apply the discrete counterpart of the wick product as introduced in holden _ et al . _ @xcite . starting from the binary random walk , one can build up a discrete wiener space , and the discrete wick product depends on this discretization .",

    ", sottinen proved the convergence of @xmath26 to the ordinary exponential of a fractional brownian motion @xcite , theorem 3 .",
    "this approach fails for the solution of ( [ simplewickdiffeq ] ) since , in a product representation , analogous to ( [ sottinendiffsolasprod ] ) , the discrete wick product @xmath20 appears instead of ordinary multiplication .",
