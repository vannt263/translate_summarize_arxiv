    "experiments in quantum computing devices did not yet employ many qubits , and the most successful approaches can only deal with 7 - 14 qubits @xcite . while many experimental and theoretical efforts are geared towards the implementation of universal quantum machines with more qubits , there could be considerable advantages with other , less powerful models which we call _ semi quantum computer _",
    "( sqc ) models .",
    "sqcs outperform classical computers for some tasks while being less powerful and potentially less technologically demanding than universal quantum computers . for more than a decade",
    ", there have been various descriptions of sqcs that could demonstrate a quantum advantage ( sometimes called _ quantum supremacy _ @xcite ) . in some cases these models do nt even require or produce entanglement @xcite .    among the candidate sqc models are those such as quantum annealers @xcite , that may be able to beat classical computers in a benchmarking experiment , but do not seem to offer an exponential advantage ( in the input size )",
    ". other candidate models , which we call sub - universal quantum computers ( suqcs ) probably do offer an exponential advantage for a few specific tasks but remain sub universal .",
    "three prominent examples of suqcs are the linear optics model @xcite , instantaneous quantum computing @xcite , and deterministic quantum computing with 1 qubit ( dqc1)@xcite .",
    "for each ( candidate ) suqc model there are three important questions we can ask :    1 .   what hard problems can it solve efficiently and are these problems interesting ( e.g for science or industry ) ? 2 .",
    "is it indeed much more feasible experimentally , and if so , why ?",
    "3 .   what are the conceptual properties that make it ( exponentially ) more powerful than a classical computer .    briefly let us mention the status of dqc1 in connection to the first two questions : a generic problem for the dqc1 model is the trace estimation problem , i.e estimating the normalized trace of an efficiently implementable unitary operation .",
    "for some subsets of @xmath0-qubit unitaries this problem is believed to be hard for a classical computer @xcite , i.e there is good evidence that it impossible to find a classical polynomial time ( in @xmath0 ) algorithm for estimating the normalized trace .",
    "for example , it is possible to use the dqc1 model to estimate jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity for the trace closure of a braid .",
    "this special case is complete for dqc1 and was implemented experimentally on 4 qubits @xcite .",
    "the model is , however , and idealization as it assumes no errors in the implementation .",
    "it is currently unknown if dqc1 is a viable model that can be scaled up in the presence of imperfections .",
    "here we deal with the third question with regards to dqc1 .",
    "our approach is to study the space of quantum states that can be generated during the computational process , and in particular study the correlations within these states .",
    "this approach follows earlier works on the circuit model @xcite , dqc1 @xcite , measurement based quantum computing @xcite , and other models @xcite . as in these works",
    ", we do not take error correction into account .",
    "for pure state quantum circuits , vidal @xcite showed that a circuit can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer when the amount of entanglement is not large ( i.e the maximal schmidt rank over all bipartition grows slower than @xmath1 ) at all times .",
    "josza and linden @xcite showed that there is an efficient classical simulation of a quantum circuit if the register has a @xmath2 block structure for constant @xmath2 at all times .",
    "an n - qubit state @xmath3 has a @xmath2 block structure if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6 qubit states .",
    "this structure implies that the blocks are not correlated .",
    "when @xmath3 is pure , the lack of correlations means that there is no entanglement between blocks of qubits .",
    "preliminary results on the dqc1 model @xcite have given some reason to suspect that discord , a more general measure of quantum correlations , may play a similar role to pure state entanglement in this context .    for any measure of quantum correlations ( e.g entanglement or discord ) and any specific way of quantifying these correlations @xmath7",
    ", we may ask if one of the following is a necessary condition for computational speedup :    _ _    1 .   at some point in the algorithm",
    "the register must have large amounts of quantum correlations @xmath7 for at least one bipartition .",
    "[ s1 ] 2 .   at some point in the algorithm",
    "the register must have some quantum correlations for exponentially many bi - partitions . [ s3 ]    by large amounts we mean that @xmath7 scales in a similar way to its upper bound ( for example if @xmath7 is the entanglement monotone _ negativity _ @xcite , it should scale faster than @xmath8 ) .",
    "there is already strong evidence that statement [ s1 ] is not valid for entanglement @xcite i.e it is known that entanglement quantified by multiplicative negativity at any point in a dqc1 circuit is bounded from above by a constant .",
    "moreover , for universal quantum computing , it is known that [ s1 ] can only be true for particular choices of entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence to support [ s1 ] for other types of quantum correlations @xcite , i.e in dqc1 the correlations as measured by the operator schmidt rank grow quickly with the system size @xcite and there is discord between the first qubit and the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "however the latter statement does not imply that there are large amounts of discord for a bipartition that can support a lot of discord , moreover it is known that the results on discord are not symmetric , i.e there is no discord if the measurements are made on the last @xmath0 qubits @xcite .",
    "our results below are related to statement [ s3 ] .",
    "we present new tools to study entanglement in degenerate quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution and show that while general dqc1 circuits can generate a state which is entangled over many bipartitions , this entanglement is always more sensitive to depolarizing noise than a generic quantum state .",
    "we also show that specific dqc1 complete circuits have less entangling power than generic circuits . as a conclusion of our results",
    ", we conjecture that statement [ s3 ] is probably violated for entanglement ( i.e for dqc1 with large @xmath9 , see eq .",
    "[ dqc1state ] below ) .",
    "the evidence in support of statement [ s3 ] for discord is significantly stronger , since discord is more robust to depolarizing noise .",
