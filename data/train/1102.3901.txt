    "nondeterministic finite automata ( nfa s ) , introduced by rabin and scott  @xcite in 1959 , play a major role in the theory of automata . for many purposes",
    "it is necessary to convert an nfa to a deterministic finite automaton ( dfa ) . in particular , for each nfa there exists a minimal dfa , unique up to isomorphism .",
    "this dfa is uniquely defined by every regular language , and uses the left quotients of the language as states .",
    "as well , it is possible to associate an nfa with each dfa , and this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "our nfa is also uniquely defined by every regular language , and uses non - empty intersections of complemented and uncomplemented quotients  the `` atoms '' of the language  as states .",
    "it appears that the nfa most often associated with a regular language is the universal automaton , sometimes appearing under different names .",
    "a recent substantial survey by lombardy and sakarovitch  @xcite on the subject of the universal automaton contains its history and a detailed discussion of its properties .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper , and mention only that research related to the universal automaton goes back to the 1970 s : , in  @xcite as reported in  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we call our nfa the `` tomaton '' because it is based on the atoms of a regular language ; we add the accent to minimize the possible confusion between `` automaton '' and `` atomaton '' .",
    "automata isomorphic to our tomaton have previously appeared in 1992 in the little - known master s thesis  @xcite of sengoku , and in the 1995 paper  @xcite by matz and potthoff .",
    "we introduce `` atomic '' automata , in which the right language of any state is a union of some atoms .",
    "this class of automata is a generalization of residual automata  @xcite in which the right language of any state is a left quotient ( which we prove to be a union of atoms ) , and includes also tomata ( where the right language of any state is an atom ) , dfa s , and universal automata .",
    "finally , we characterize the class of nfa s for which the subset construction yields a minimal dfa .",
    "more specifically , we show that the subset construction applied to an nfa produces a minimal dfa if and only if the reverse automaton of that nfa is atomic . this is a generalization of brzozowski s method for dfa minimization by double reversal  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : lae ] recalls properties of regular languages , finite automata , and systems of language equations .",
    "atoms of a regular language and the tomaton are introduced and studied in section  [ sec : atomaton ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "atomic ] , we examine nfa s in which the right language of every state is a union of atoms .",
    "brzozowski s method of dfa minimization is extended in section  [ sec : extension ] , and section  [ sec : conc ] closes the paper .",
